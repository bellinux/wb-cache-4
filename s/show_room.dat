2500|$|Much to his chagrin, {{the most}} {{repeated}} clip is of Parkinson's interview [...] with entertainer Rod Hull in 1976. While the pair were chatting, Hull's glove puppet, Emu, continually and (apparently) uncontrollably attacked the interviewer, eventually {{causing him to}} fall off his chair. Fellow guest Billy Connolly threatened, [...] "If that bird comes anywhere near me, I'll break its neck and your bloody arm!" [...] Hull swiftly got his [...] "pet" [...] back on best behaviour. Parkinson had always lamented the fact that despite all the star guests he had interviewed over the years, he would probably be remembered for [...] "that bloody bird". However, in an appearance on the TV <b>show</b> <b>Room</b> 101, he got his chance of revenge when the host, Paul Merton, unexpectedly brought Emu locked in a guillotine on stage and Parkinson took his chance by beheading the puppet, saying, [...] "Goodbye, you foul beast." ...|$|E

2500|$|Clarkson's {{views are}} often showcased on {{television}} shows. In 1997, Clarkson {{appeared on the}} light-hearted comedy <b>show</b> <b>Room</b> 101, in which a guest nominates things they hate in life to be consigned to nothingness. Clarkson dispatched caravans, houseflies, the sitcom Last of the Summer Wine, the mentality within golf clubs, and vegetarians. He has made several appearances on the prime time talk shows Parkinson and Friday Night with Jonathan Ross since 2002. By 2003, his persona was deemed to fit the mould for the series Grumpy Old Men, in which middle-aged men talk about any aspects of modern life which irritate them. Since the topical news panel show Have I Got News for You dismissed regular host Angus Deayton in October 2002, Clarkson {{has become one of}} the most regularly used guest hosts on the show. Clarkson has appeared as a panellist on the political current affairs television show [...] Question Time twice since 2000.

2500|$|During the 1920s, when Vancouver prospered as a [...] "free port" [...] {{supplying}} illicit whiskey to the US Pacific Northwest (either Canadian-made or {{shipped in}} by sea from Mexico), the city's night life boomed.
