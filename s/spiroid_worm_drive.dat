Based on the theory established, toroidal <b>worm</b> <b>drives</b> can be classified into two main categories: with singular points and without singular points. That is to say, the unmodified hourglass worm gearing is merely a special case of the modified one in essence. Furthermore, the meshing characteristics of a double-enveloping toroidal <b>worm</b> <b>drive</b> are entirely up to the situation of the solution of the meshing equation of the second envelope...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{processing}} of worm gear components is quite simple, and manufacturing method is relatively complete, there’s {{no need to}} make special equipment. But to new energy equipment, research new-type of manufacturing technology is required. On the basis of meshing theory and drawing on manufacture of the planar enveloping {{as well as the}} tapper enveloping hourglass worm, a research of manufacture technique about the non-backlash double-roller enveloping hourglass <b>worm</b> <b>drive</b> has conducted on the Y 3180 E gear-hobbing machines and four-axis four-linkage NC machines. The key pieces have been processed out, and a calibration has been conducted on the single-head worm. All of these work will provid a theoretical foundation and practical experience for the actual manufacture. <b>Worm</b> <b>drive</b> as important type of drive in mechanical drive, it obtained widespread application in national defense, metallurgy, shipbuilding, building, chemical industry and other professions[1, 2].

50|$|A <b>worm</b> <b>drive</b> is a gear {{arrangement}} {{in which a}} worm (which is a gear {{in the form of}} a screw) meshes with a worm gear (which is similar in appearance to a spur gear). The two elements are also called the worm screw and worm wheel. The terminology is often confused by imprecise use of the term worm gear to refer to the worm, the worm gear, or the <b>worm</b> <b>drive</b> as a unit.|$|R

2500|$|Ford began {{shipping}} Fordson tractors to Ford Motor Company Limited in Britain in 1917 to meet {{an order}} from the British government for 5,000. Between the time the order was accepted and when production started, Ford overhauled the design to solve several problems. The car-type radiator was enlarged to [...] capacity to cure overheating problems. The additional weight also helped hold the front down. In early Fordsons, the <b>worm</b> <b>drive</b> was located at the top under the driver's seat. During heavy operation the heat became unbearable to the operator. The <b>worm</b> <b>drive</b> was relocated {{to solve this problem}} and also allowed larger rear wheels which improved traction. Several changes were also made to simplify manufacture. The Fordson used the Model T coil magneto system; and water and oil pumps were eliminated in favor of the simpler thermosiphon cooling and splash lubrication.|$|R
