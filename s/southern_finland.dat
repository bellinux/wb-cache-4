5|$|The {{economic}} {{condition of}} the country had deteriorated so drastically that recovery to pre-conflict levels was not achieved until 1925. The most acute crisis was in the food supply, already deficient in 1917, though starvation had been avoided in <b>southern</b> <b>Finland.</b> According to the Red and White militants, the Civil War would solve all past problems, but instead the power struggle led to starvation in <b>southern</b> <b>Finland</b> too. Late in 1918, Finnish politician Rudolf Holsti appealed for relief to Herbert Hoover, the American chairman of the Committee for Relief in Belgium: Hoover arranged for food shipments and persuaded the Allies to relax their blockade of the Baltic Sea, which had obstructed food supplies to Finland, to allow the food in.|$|E
5|$|Finland {{was divided}} into two {{operational}} zones. Northern Finland was the staging area for Army Norway. Its goal was to execute a two-pronged pincer movement on the strategic port of Murmansk, named Operation Silver Fox. <b>Southern</b> <b>Finland</b> was still under {{the responsibility of the}} Finnish Army. The goal of the Finnish forces was, at first, to recapture Finnish Karelia at Lake Ladoga as well as the Karelian Isthmus, which included Finland's second largest city Vyborg.|$|E
5|$|The {{response}} to a school shooting that occurred at the Seinäjoki University of Applied Sciences in Kauhajoki, a city in Western Finland, on 23 September 2008 was widespread. In the shooting, 22-year-old culinary arts student Matti Juhani Saari shot and killed ten people before committing suicide. Eight students had been killed ten months before in the Jokela school shooting in <b>southern</b> <b>Finland.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ali Aaltonen was {{replaced}} by Eero Haapalainen. He in turn was displaced by the Eino Rahja, Adolf Taimi and Evert Eloranta triumvirate. The last Red Guard commander in chief was Kullervo Manner. Some talented men with a high sense of responsibility such as Hugo Salmela in Tampere rose up to take the lead, {{but they could not}} change the course of the war. The Reds achieved some local victories, as they retreated from <b>southern</b> <b>Finland</b> toward Russia, e.g. against German troops in the fierce Battle of Syrjäntaka on 28–29 April in Tuulos.|$|E
5|$|C. m. monedula (Linnaeus, 1758), the {{nominate}} subspecies, {{is found}} in eastern Europe. Its range extends across Scandinavia, from <b>southern</b> <b>Finland</b> south to Esbjerg and Haderslev in Denmark, through eastern Germany and Poland, and south across eastern central Europe to the Carpathian Mountains and north-western Romania, Vojvodina in northern Serbia, and Slovenia. It breeds in south-eastern Norway, southern Sweden, and northern and eastern Denmark, with occasional wintering in England and France. It has been recorded as a rare vagrant to Spain. It has a pale nape and sides of the neck, a dark throat, and a light grey partial collar of variable extent.|$|E
5|$|The Finnish Civil War (27 January – 15 May 1918) {{concerned}} {{leadership and}} control of Finland during {{the transition from a}} Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire to an independent state. The conflict formed a part of the national, political, and social turmoil caused by World War I (Eastern Front) in Europe. The war was fought between the Reds, led by the Social Democratic Party and the Whites, conducted by the non-socialist, conservative-led senate. The paramilitary Red Guards, composed of industrial and agrarian workers, controlled the cities and industrial centers of <b>southern</b> <b>Finland.</b> The paramilitary White Guards, composed of peasants and middle-class and upper-class factions, controlled rural central and northern Finland.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} Finnish troops {{on each side}} varied from 70,000 to 90,000 and both had around 100,000 rifles, 300-400 machine guns and a few hundred cannons. While the Red Guards {{consisted}} mostly of volunteers (wages paid {{at the beginning of}} the war), the White Army contained only 11,000–15,000 volunteers, the remainder being conscripts. The main motives for volunteering were economic factors (salary, food), idealism, and peer pressure. The Red Guards included 2,600 female troops, mostly girls recruited from the industrial centres and cities of <b>southern</b> <b>Finland.</b> Urban and agricultural workers constituted the majority of the Red Guards, whereas land-owning farmers and well-educated people formed the backbone of the White Army.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of the two opposing armed forces, the Red and White Guards, imposed a state of dual power and multiple sovereignty on Finnish society, typically the prelude to a civil war. The decisive cleavage between the guards broke out during the General strike; the Reds executed several political opponents in <b>southern</b> <b>Finland,</b> and the first armed clashes between the Whites and Reds broke out. In total, 34 casualties were reported. Eventually, the political rivalries of 1917 led to a race for weapons and an escalation towards civil war.|$|E
5|$|Mari Kiviniemi {{was elected}} {{the new leader}} of the Centre Party in its conference in Lahti on 12 June. The support for the Centre Party has been {{significantly}} higher in northern Finland than elsewhere: in the 2007 election the party received over 43% of the votes in both Oulu and Lapland electoral districts, compared with its nationwide support of 23.1%, while in 2003 the party's vote share in the two northernmost districts was even higher) As the top spots of the party leadership went to members from <b>southern</b> <b>Finland,</b> many of their supporters {{in the northern part}} of the country felt disenchanted; one local party chief even warned that many northern Centre Party supporters might switch sides to the True Finns.|$|E

5|$|The White Guards {{executed}} Red Guard {{and party}} leaders, common Red troopers, socialist {{members of the}} Finnish parliament and local Red administration, and those active in the Red terror. The level of killings varied over the months as they conquered <b>southern</b> <b>Finland,</b> and initially did not encounter marked resistance in White Finland. The comprehensive White terror started with the general offensive of the Whites in March 1918, increased constantly, culminated {{in the end of}} the war and ceased soon after the enemy had been sent to the prison camps. During the peak of the executions, between the end of April and the beginning of May, 200 Reds were shot per day. The White terror hit strong against the Russian soldiers who assisted the Finnish Reds and several Russian non-socialist civilians were killed in the aftermath of the Battle for Viipuri.|$|E
5|$|The attack force {{returned}} to the United Kingdom in several groups. Tait led 16 Lancasters out of Yagodnik in the evening of 16 September; most of these aircraft flew over <b>southern</b> <b>Finland,</b> Sweden and Denmark. One of the Lancasters went off course and crashed on a mountain near Nesbyen in Norway, killing all eleven airmen aboard, the only Allied casualties of Operation Paravane. Nine other Lancasters departed on 17 September, followed by five {{the next day and}} two on 21 September. The remaining Lancasters had been judged to be damaged beyond repair, and were handed over to the Soviets. The Mosquito, which had been damaged by anti-aircraft fire during a sortie over Kaafjord, returned once repairs were complete on 26 September. The two Liberators were the final aircraft to depart, and flew out of Yagodnik carrying McMullen on 27 September.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, a discontinuous front line ran through <b>southern</b> <b>Finland</b> from west to east, dividing the country into White Finland and Red Finland. The Red Guards controlled the area to the south, including nearly all the major towns and industrial centres, and the largest estates and farms with high numbers of crofters and tenant farmers. The White Army controlled the area to the north, which was predominantly agrarian with small or medium-sized farms and tenant farmers, and where crofters were few, or held a better social position than in the south. Enclaves of the opposing forces existed {{on both sides of the}} front line: within the White area lay the industrial towns of Varkaus, Kuopio, Oulu, Raahe, Kemi and Tornio; within the Red area lay Porvoo, Kirkkonummi and Uusikaupunki. The elimination of these strongholds was a priority for both armies in February 1918.|$|E

5|$|The {{food supply}} of the country {{depended}} on cereals produced in southern Russia, while the Finns had specialized in milk and butter production. The cessation of the cereal imports from disintegrating Russia led to food shortages in Finland. The Senate responded by introducing rationing and price controls. The farmers opposed the state control; a black market with sharply rising food prices formed and export to free market of the Petrograd area increased. Food supply, prices, {{and in the end}} the fear of starvation became emotional political issues between farmers and industrial workers, in particular the unemployed ones. The common people, their fears exploited by the politicians and the political media, took to the streets. Despite the food shortages, no large-scale starvation hit <b>southern</b> <b>Finland</b> before the civil war and the food market remained a secondary stimulator in the power struggle of the Finnish state.|$|E
5|$|This failure {{prompted}} the German command to rethink its strategy. To reinforce {{the troops and}} replace the losses, additional personnel were transferred from the 163rd Infantry Division based in <b>Southern</b> <b>Finland.</b> With a combined effort by all the German forces, extensive air-support by Luftflotte 5, {{as well as a}} supportive flanking attack by the Finnish 6th Division, they finally broke through the Soviet defenses on 6 July and captured Salla. A heavy Soviet counterattack drove them back out of the town but on 8 July, a general Soviet retreat of the 122nd Rifle Division allowed the German forces to recapture the town. The Soviet troops had to leave most of their artillery behind and in the heavy fighting some 50 Soviet tanks were destroyed. In order not to lose momentum, the SS Division Nord pursued the 122nd Rifle Division toward Lampela, while the 169th Division turned east toward Kayraly. Meanwhile, the Finnish 6th Division was making good progress in its flanking manoeuvre to the east to circumvent Kayraly and Lape Apa.|$|E
25|$|The plan {{involved}} {{using the}} series of fortifications built after 1790 as staging grounds for the Russian advances into Finland. In <b>southern</b> <b>Finland,</b> armies were to isolate the fortifications and first {{take control of the}} whole of <b>southern</b> <b>Finland</b> before advancing further to the north. Forces in Savolax were to press hard against the Swedes and reach the Gulf of Bothnia towards Uleåborg and Vasa to cut off the retreat of {{the main body of the}} Swedish army.|$|E
