500|$|It {{has been}} {{thought in the}} past that tornadoes moved almost {{exclusively}} in a northeasterly direction. This is false, and a potentially deadly myth which can lead to a false sense of security, especially for unaware spotters or chasers. Although the majority of tornadoes move northeast, this is normally due to the motion of the storm, and tornadoes can arrive from any direction. The expectation of northeasterly travel may be accurate in many cases, but {{is no more than a}} <b>statistical</b> <b>observation</b> about tornadoes in general that any particular tornado may defy at any time. A deadly F5 tornado that hit the city of Jarrell, Texas in 1997 moved to the southwest - directly opposite of commonly expected storm motion. Additionally, tornadoes can shift without notice due to storm motion changes or effects on the tornado itself from factors such as its rear flank downdraft. [...] This change of direction proved deadly in the 2013 El Reno, OK tornado in which a 2.6 mile wide tornado shifted from an east direction to a northeast direction killing at least 4 storm chasers.|$|E

Lung cancer occurs spontaneously, {{and there is no}} difference between a [...] "natural" [...] cancer and another one caused by radon (or smoking). Furthermore, it takes years for a cancer to develop, so that determining the past exposure of a case is usually very approximative.

The term derives from the Sherlock Holmes novel The Hound of the Baskervilles in which a big, fierce black dog is made to glow in the dark using phosphorus; the hellish-looking dog chases a man, who runs in great fear and dies of an apparent heart attack. Another man later falls to his death while being chased by the hound.|$|E
5000|$|The {{number of}} ‘Customers’ at any time, however, cannot be {{calculated}} from anything else. It {{is one example}} of a factor with a unique characteristic, known as an ‘asset-stock’. This critical feature is that it accumulates over time, so “customers today = customers yesterday +/- customers won and lost”. This is not a theory or <b>statistical</b> <b>observation,</b> but is axiomatic of the way the world works. Other examples include cash (changed by cash-in and cash-out-flows), staff (changed by hiring and attrition), capacity, product range and dealers. Many intangible factors behave in the same way, e.g. reputation and staff skills.Dierickx and Cool (1989) point out that this causes serious problems for explaining performance over time: ...|$|E
5000|$|HD Lite can be {{achieved}} by any combination of several techniques. Rate-shaping dynamically adjusts allocated bit rate for each of a set of TV-channels, based on an allocation-policy (which can come from realtime video-analysis or an operator-specified program weighting.) Rate shaping allows a set of channels to be transmitted with less bandwidth, based on the <b>statistical</b> <b>observation</b> that not all channels display the same level of motion-activity at a given instant of time (or the period of observation.) Downsampling reduces the spatial (horizontal and/or vertical) resolution of the TV-program, reducing the TV-signal's pixel-rate, and therefore its bandwidth requirements. Thus far, customers have reported downsampling on [...] "1080i" [...] signals only; 1920x1080i can be downsampled to 1440x1080i or 1280x1080i, with a corresponding reduction in transmission bandwidth. In contrast, over-the-air (ATSC) broadcasts of 1080i are fixed at 1920x1080. Temporal (frame-rate) reduction has not been attempted yet, as it unacceptably changes the character of motion video sequences.|$|E
50|$|A related {{statistical}} concept, {{the notion}} of E-statistic or energy-statistic was introduced by Gábor J. Székely in the 1980s when he was giving colloquium lectures in Budapest, Hungary and at MIT, Yale, and Columbia. This concept is based on {{the notion of}} Newton’s potential energy. The idea is to consider <b>statistical</b> <b>observations</b> as heavenly bodies governed by a statistical potential energy which is zero only when an underlying statistical null hypothesis is true. Energy statistics are functions of distances between <b>statistical</b> <b>observations.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{subject of}} overreactions {{has also been}} {{important}} in behavioral finance. In his 2006 PhD thesis, Duran examined 130,000 data points of daily prices for closed-end funds {{in terms of their}} deviation from the net asset value (NAV). Funds exhibiting a large deviation from NAV were likely to behave in the opposite direction of the subsequent day. Even more interesting was the <b>statistical</b> <b>observation</b> that a large deviation in the opposite direction preceded such large deviations. These precursors may suggest that an underlying cause of these large moves—in the absence of significant change in valuation—may be due to the positioning of traders in advance of anticipated news. For example, suppose many traders are anticipating positive news and buy the stock. If the positive news does not materialize they are inclined to sell in large numbers, thereby suppressing the price significantly below the previous levels. This interpretation is inconsistent with EMH but is consistent with asset flow differential equations (AFDE) that incorporate behavioral concepts with the finiteness of assets. Research continues on efforts to optimize the parameters of the asset flow equations in order to forecast near term prices (see Duran and Caginalp [...] ).|$|E
50|$|No {{stranger}} to smallpox, Lady Mary {{had lost her}} brother to the devastating disease. Soon afterwards she also contracted smallpox. Although she survived she was left with severe facial scarring. While in Turkey she came across the process of variolation as it was practiced amongst the people of Constantinople. She first mentioned variolation in the famous letter to her friend, Sarah Chiswell, in April 1717. in which she enthusiastically recounted the process, which in Constantinople was most commonly administered by experienced elderly women. In 1718, she had the practice conducted on her five-year-old son, Edward Montagu. The procedure was supervised by the embassy doctor Charles Maitland. On her return to England she had her four-year-old daughter inoculated {{in the presence of}} physicians of the royal court in 1721. Both variolations proved successful. Later on that year Maitland conducted an experimental inoculation of six prisoners within the Newgate Prison of London. In the experiment, six condemned prisoners were variolated and later exposed to smallpox with the promise of freedom if they survived. The experiment was a success and soon variolation was drawing attention from the royal family who helped promote the procedure throughout England. However, variolation caused the death of Prince Octavius of Great Britain, eighth son and thirteenth child of King George III in 1783.Despite opposition, variolation established itself as a mainstream medical treatment across England. Part of its success was founded on <b>statistical</b> <b>observation</b> which confirmed that variolation was a safer alternative to contracting smallpox naturally, strengthened by the assumption that it protected against the disease for life. The major faults of variolation lay within its simplicity. Doctors sought to monopolize the simple treatment by convincing the public that the procedure could only be done by a trained professional. The procedure was now preceded by a severe bloodletting, in which the patient was bled often to faintness in order to 'purify' the blood and prevent fever. Doctors also began to favor deep incisions, which also discouraged amateurs.|$|E
