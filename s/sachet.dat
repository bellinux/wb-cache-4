40|$|Intraguild {{predation}} of Neoseiulus cucumeris Oudemans (Phytoseiidae) by soil-dwelling predators, Dalotia coriaria Kraatz (Staphylinidae) {{may limit}} {{the utility of}} open rearing systems in greenhouse thrips management programs. We determined the rate of D. coriaria invasion of N. cucumeris breeder material presented in piles or <b>sachets,</b> bran piles (without mites), and sawdust piles. We also observed mite dispersal from breeder piles and <b>sachets</b> when D. coriaria were not present. Dalotia coriaria invaded breeder and bran piles at higher rates than sawdust piles and <b>sachets.</b> Furthermore, proportions of N. cucumeris in <b>sachets</b> were six- to eight-fold higher compared with breeder piles. When D. coriaria were absent, N. cucumeris dispersed from breeder piles and <b>sachets</b> for up to seven weeks. In earlier weeks, more N. cucumeris dispersed from breeder piles compared with <b>sachets,</b> and in later weeks more N. cucumeris dispersed from <b>sachets</b> compared with breeder piles. <b>Sachets</b> protected N. cucumeris from intraguild predation by D. coriaria resulting in higher populations of mites. Therefore, <b>sachets</b> {{should be used in}} greenhouse biocontrol programs that also release D. coriaria. Furthermore, breeder piles that provide “quick-releases” or <b>sachets</b> that provide “slow-releases” of mites should be considered when incorporating N. cucumeris into greenhouse thrips management programs...|$|R

25|$|In 1835, Argumosa {{was one of}} {{the doctors}} tasked with {{studying}} the nun's stigmata. They disinfected and treated the wounds, and in less than three weeks all were healed and the nun was discharged from their care. The nun was banished to Talavera de la Reina. Despite the fact that both religious and civil authorities agreed with the decision that the stigmata were fraudulent, some did not accept Argumosa's diagnosis. However, during the case, a friar confessed that, while traveling with him to Rome to found new convents, the nun had given him a <b>sachet</b> containing a substance that would cause a small ulcer when applied to the body.|$|E
25|$|While some Baras are Christians, most {{retain their}} {{traditional}} religious beliefs. Tamarind trees were traditionally considered sacred and are found planted near many Bara villages, where residents will leave offerings like woven mats, locks of hair, shells {{and other items}} when offering prayers or after their requests are fulfilled. The indigenous bontona tree was also considered sacred and villagers would tie charms to the branches when offering prayers. Each village also had a hazomanga, a wooden pillar considered the most sacred site of worship, which served as the public altar for group prayer and offerings. This pillar was typically 20 to 30 feet high and a <b>sachet</b> containing sacred herbs, sand and wood chips was hung from the top. Bara men traditionally conduct the rites associated with honoring the ancestors, while women conduct rites associated with fertility and the forces of nature. An exception is childbirth, during which the mother is secluded {{for a period of}} four days; men watch over the birthing process and conduct associated rites.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} was conducted using membrane <b>sachets</b> containing MP 148 diet or phosphate-buffered sucrose with and without purified Potato leafroll virus to determine if direct encounter with the virus would arrest the aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Homoptera:Aphididae). In only two out of 36 tests were there significantly more aphids settled on <b>sachets</b> containing the virus. In all other tests, there were either significantly fewer aphids on <b>sachets</b> containing virus or {{there were no differences}} between virus treatments and control <b>sachets</b> without virus. In an experiment using excised Physalis floridana leaves, twice as many M. persicae settled on virus-infected leaves as on noninfected control leaves. Taken together, the results indicate that arrestment of M. persicae on potato leaf roll virus-infected plants may be due to enhanced nutritional qualities resulting from disease, but not from direct encounter with or detection of the virus.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Synthetic odour baits {{present an}} unexploited {{potential}} for sampling, surveillance {{and control of}} malaria and other mosquito vectors. However, application of such baits is impeded by the unavailability of robust odour delivery devices that perform reliably under field conditions. In the present study the suitability of low density polyethylene (LDPE) and nylon strips for dispensing synthetic attractants of host-seeking Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes was evaluated. METHODS: Baseline experiments assessed the numbers of An. gambiae mosquitoes caught in response to low density polyethylene (LDPE) <b>sachets</b> filled with attractants, attractant-treated nylon strips, control LDPE <b>sachets,</b> and control nylon strips placed in separate MM-X traps. Residual attraction of An. gambiae to attractant-treated nylon strips was determined subsequently. The effects of sheet thickness and surface area on numbers of mosquitoes caught in MM-X traps containing the synthetic kairomone blend dispensed from LDPE <b>sachets</b> and nylon strips were also evaluated. Various treatments were tested through randomized 4 ¿×¿ 4 Latin Square experimental designs under semi-field conditions in western Kenya. RESULTS: Attractant-treated nylon strips collected 5. 6 times more An. gambiae mosquitoes than LDPE <b>sachets</b> filled with the same attractants. The attractant-impregnated nylon strips were consistently more attractive (76. 95 %; n¿=¿ 9, 120) than <b>sachets</b> containing the same attractants (18. 59 %; n¿=¿ 2, 203), control nylon strips (2. 17 %; n¿=¿ 257) and control LDPE <b>sachets</b> (2. 29 %; n¿=¿ 271) up to 40 ¿days post-treatment (P...|$|R

However, some types of pyramid tea bags have been criticised as being environmentally unfriendly, since their synthetic material is not as biodegradable as loose tea leaves and paper tea bags.|$|E
