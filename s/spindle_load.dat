40|$|Abstract — Boring {{process in}} Grey Cast Iron Casting (GCIC) {{materials}} {{are widely used}} in machinery industries and particularly in automotive industries. However, improved mechanical properties of these materials limits us due to high cost of processing these materials. <b>Spindle</b> <b>Load</b> {{is one of the}} most important factors in machining operations of such materials and it is mainly affected by cutting conditions including the cutting speed, depth of cut, insert material and cooling environment along with length and diameter of the tool body. Machining manufacturing process are now moving towards automations. Therefore, <b>Spindle</b> <b>Load</b> monitoring is important to achieve an efficient manufacturing process. In this study, a tool wear prediction model during the boring machining operation of gray cast iron is studied. It is based on the monitoring of tool performance in controlled machining tests with measurements of tool life, surface finish, bore size variation, cutting time and load on spindle in terms of % current under different combinations of cutting parameters (cutting speed, depth of cut, tool nose radius, length & diameter of tool, tool material and coolant pressure & concentration). The influence of cutting parameters on the tool life was studied experimentally by performing more than 128 cutting tests. A prediction model was then developed to predict tool wear. The basic steps used in generating the model adopted in the development of the prediction model are: collection of data; analysis, pre-processing and featur...|$|E

The thermo-elastic machine behaviour, i. e. the stress dependent temperature distribution and the resulting deformation of the machine tool, is influenced by a variety of design and thermo-technical parameters [1 - 3]. Therefore WZL develops an indirect thermal compensation method. The thermo-elastic machine behaviour is experimentally determined in a calibration procedure based on spindle speed and effective power using a stressing unit. The transfer function between speed and power of the spindle as an input and displacement of the TCP as an output can be written as a sum of second order time delay functions...|$|E

This paper presents the study of building a neural network model for predicting the behavior of a boring process during its full life cycle. This prediction is achieved by the fusion of the predictions of three principal components extracted as features from the joint time–frequency distributions of energy of the <b>spindle</b> <b>loads</b> observed during the boring process. Furthermore, prediction uncertainty is assessed using nonlinear regression in order to quantify the errors associated with the prediction.

40|$|The full vehicle {{simulation}} on durability proving grounds is a {{well established}} technique in the development process of passenger car manufacturers. The respective road surfaces are designed to generate representative <b>spindle</b> <b>loads</b> and typically include events {{that will result in}} large tire deformations. Depending on manufacturer and the combination of vehicle size and wheel properties, these deformations can be so large that the tire belt and/or sidewall have contact with the rim crown (protected by the tire sidewall). The current tendency to low-aspect ratio tires reduces the available deformation capability of the tire while simultaneously introducing larger nonlinearities in the sidewall behavior. After a short overview of the standard modeling technique used by the CDTire model family to handle such events, a refinement of this technique is introduced, modeling both the non-linearity behavior of the sidewall and a possible subsequent rim contact. This refinement al so takes the rim deformation into account. The parameter identification procedure for the large deformation extension is explained and validation results are shown. In combination with extended post-processing functionality, this model extension enables CDTire in misuse-like simulations...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{framework}} of self-aware machines based on data collected using the MTConnect protocol. Beyond exist-ing applications of OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) reporting, the proposed framework integrates multiple sources of information for work-piece and machine condition moni-toring, and equipment time to failure prediction in manufac-turing processes, and provides feedback to shop supervisor. Firstly, we propose a method to predict component wear and failure based on operational data. ICP (Interactive Closest Point) algorithm is used {{to find the best}} matching tool path given a certain tool number to identify similar machining pro-cesses. The result of ICP tool path matching, together with other parameters such as spindle speed, feed rate and tool number, are used to adaptively cluster the machining pro-cesses. For each process cluster, a particle filter based prog-nostic algorithm is used to predict tool wear and/or spindle bearing failure. Secondly, we propose to use anomaly detec-tion methods to detect changes in normal behavior of the ma-chines. Various machine learning algorithms are utilized to detect anomalies based on real-time data, and a voting mech-anism is used to decide when to trigger an alarm. Thirdly, the axes traverse is aggregated to provide a measure of the wear on various axes in the machine, which is correlated to errors in position comparing to the commanded positions and nominal tool paths. <b>Spindle</b> <b>load</b> verse rotating speed is also examined to facilitate shop floor scheduling to avoid damage caused by unintentionally excessive machine usage.

40|$|Today's tire models used in MBD full vehicle {{application}} scenarios like Ride&Comfort or Durability are parameterized with {{a variety}} of <b>spindle</b> <b>load</b> measurements: quasi-static (e. g. vertical, lateral and circumferential stiffness), quasi-steady-state (e. g. pure lateral and longitudinal slip) and transient (e. g. cleat run) tests in well defined tire stand-alone test rigs measure the accumulated tire force acting on the wheel center. While some tests are designed to induce local deformations (e. g. vertical stiffness on cleats), no measurement of local reactions (e. g. sidewall displacement or rim strain) are performed in a standardized way - apart from footprint and contour tests. The level of detail in structural FEA tire models renders them unfeasible for most full vehicle applications due to the implied computational effort; however, dedicated tire stand-alone scenarios are well within reach of today's R&D IT infrastructures. While their applicability for transient simul ations (such as cleat runs) is still under investigation, quasi-static and steady-state simulations are common practice in the tire industry. Of course, without access to the proprietary information on constructional and material data of the tire industry, vehicle OEM departments, R&D suppliers and universities need to rely on reverse engineering techniques to parameterize their FE tire models. The main focus of this paper is the introduction of a newly developed structural MBD tire model with dedicated descriptions of the main constructional elements of a tire such as belt, carcass and bandage layers with cords. It was specifically designed to combine the prediction quality of quasi-static and steady-state FEA models with the computational performance of MBD tire models. A parameter identification procedure is introduced that explicitly excludes cleat runs and focuses instead on a mixture of static, steady-state and local geometrical measurements.

40|$|Machining {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} operations in many industrial environments. To prosper in today's competitive industrial world any machining system should be able to deliver the highest possible quality at the lowest possible costs, with very high reliability and flexibility. To fulfil these requirements the idea of e-Monitoring an industrial process was introduced by the Intelligent Process Monitoring and Management (IPMM) Centre at Cardiff University. It has considerable potential applications in industrial systems to not only monitor the health of the machines but also for data management and presentation for future decision making. The research presented in this thesis considers the evolution of two different low complexity signal analysis techniques which can be used for e-Monitoring the health of the cutters used in milling machine tools. The researched techniques are based in the time and frequency domains. The frequency domain analysis technique is based on the idea of using switched capacitor filters and microcontrollers to monitor the frequencies of interest in existing machine tool signals (<b>spindle</b> <b>load</b> and speed) thus avoiding the need for external sensors. The results of frequency domain analysis are used to assess the health of the cutter. The time domain analysis technique uses the same signals to analyse any variations within a tool rotation period and relate these to the health of the cutter. The results are integrated before final decision making which helps in reducing false alarms. The thesis goes on to logically describe the design and development of an on-line microcontroller based distributed intelligent e-Monitoring system for a milling machine tool model Kondia B 500, using the proposed signal analysis techniques. Some additional features such as internet and GSM connectivity have also been added to the designed system. The designed system was interfaced to the machine tool and tested for its reliability which was found to be competitive with many other very expensive systems. The designed system can be fitted into a machine tool at the manufacturing stage or it could be interfaced to an existing machine tool for automatically detecting a tooth breakage...|$|E

40|$|This Master thesis {{consists}} of a literature review on surface integrity after milling with ceramic tools in nickel‐based super alloys. Examples of turning and milling with carbide tools have also been included, due to little literature on the above. The effect of cutting fluids in ceramic milling operations, {{and the effect of}} high pressure cooling in turning operations have been reviewed. Last the possibilities of using a Finite Element Analysis (FEM) program, to study the effect of high pressure cooling in turning operations have been reviewed. There have been done machining tests with two different milling cutters on NTNU (32 and 63 mmcutters). One of the tests was not successful (32 mm cutter), while the other (63 mm) showed a large improvement potential for Volvo Aero Norway (VAN). In a comparative analysis of tool life, VAN’s existing tool supplier showed better results than two other tool supplier companies. Regrinded tools,gave an equivalent or marginally worse tool life. The effect of cutting fluids in ceramic milling operations was studied. The use of flood cooling gave a non acceptable tool life, while use of Minimum Quantity Lubrication (MQL), (application of pure cutting fluid with a flow rate of 20 – 90 ml/h) gave a marginally worse tool life. Surface integrity after ceramic milling was studied in a separate experiment. The work piece was cut up in pieces, and polished so the thickness of the deformed layer could be studied in a microscope(30 – 60 μm). This experiment was repeated with a lower radial cut and the use of MQL, this resulted in a thinner deformed layer (9 – 13 μm), unfortunately this was not within VAN’s 5 μm requirement. The improvement potential in today’s ceramic milling operations was calculated during two machining tests at VAN. When the cutting speed and feed was increased (from Vc(nom) = 1100 to 1283 m/min, and from fz = 0. 08 to 0. 10 mm/tooth), the productivity increased by 46 %. Since the tool life was the same, a cost saving of 23 and 25 % can be achieved for the 80 and 63 mm cutter respectively. If the machining centre had coped with the increased <b>spindle</b> <b>load,</b> the recommended parameters from the NTNU tests could have been used (Vc(nom) = 1283 m/min, fz = 0. 16 mm/tooth). This would have increased the total productivity with 133 % and a cost saving of 50 and 58 %. An economic analysis show that VAN can reduce costs if they regrind used ceramic inserts in USA, but that they must incorporate a insert size in between of their two current sized, to get an acceptable cost saving. The large cost saving potential found in the fall project (Barstad, 2009), has disappeared due to VAN’s exceptionally negotiation of the purchase price of ceramic inserts (47 ‐ 64 % reduction). The literature review reveal that no realistic FEM models of the effect of high pressure cooling in turning operations exists. Therefore it was only performed a simple FEM analysis of turning with ceramic tools in a nickel‐based super alloy. A low cutting speed (10 m/min) had to be used, since the program did not accept high cutting speeds (300 m/min) in this alloy. In connection with the project presentation at VAN, a movie regarding milling with ceramic tools, and a Power Point Presentation was made. </p...|$|E

The current tendency to low-aspect ratio tires reduces the available deformation capability of the tire while simultaneously introducing larger nonlinearities in the sidewall behavior. This paper is based on a co-development project between Fraunhofer LBF and Honda R&D and is dealing with the development of a tire model, which can accurately handle very large deformations of the tire up to misuse-like applications. The model is based on the LBF tire model CDTire, where several nonlinear extensions of the belt and sidewall model have been implemented to accurately capture the large deformation behavior. These model extensions are also taking the belt/sidewall and sidewall/rim contact into account. The paper is a consequent continuation and improvement of first modeling and validation efforts previously published in, which at that time were based on quasi-static tire stand-alone measurements. The main innovations are related to the implementation of a new dynamic test rig specially designed by Fraunhofer LBF for large deformation tire testing. With this test rig, new impulses could be derived for the modeling and for the parameter identification procedure. Additionally, first full vehicle simulation results of a very severe event are shown to validate the method of approach, with comparisons to both the respective measurements and the simulation results without the model extensions.

40|$|A screen {{performed}} {{by members of}} the Stenmark laboratory where siRNA-mediated knock down of 70 proteins with a potential role in cytokinesis was performed, revealed a potential role for Sorting Nexin 4 (SNX 4) in mitosis. Cells that lacked SNX 4 seemed to stop up in prometaphase (unpublished findings from the Stenmark laboratory). Based on these initial findings we therefore decided to investigate whether SNX 4 is a true mediator of mitosis. HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA targeting SNX 4 to investigate the effects of SNX 4 deficiency in the cells. To determine where SNX 4 localized in cells and if its localization changed during mitosis, HeLa cells were transfected with and control SNX 4 siRNA, fixed on cover slips, and stained with antibodies before SNX 4 microscopy. Lastly, we performed live-cell imaging of SNX 4 depleted cells through mitosis in order to more thoroughly study the effects of SNX 4 knockdown. We found that SNX 4 knock down cells had increased percentage of cells in early mitosis and a decreased percentage of cells in cytokinesis compared with control cells. Confocal microscopy of HeLa cells stained with antibody against SNX 4 showed that this protein was localized to the spindle poles in metaphase. The live-cell imaging showed that SNX 4 depleted cells spent more time in prometaphase and metaphase and had a higher percentage of cells that struggled to align their chromosomes properly and to complete mitosis. Altogether our findings support our hypothesis that SNX 4 is a true mediator of mitosis. Since a greater proportion of the SNX 4 -depleted cells were struggling to progress to anaphase and had alignment problems in metaphase compared with control cells, we suggest that SNX 4 plays a role in chromosome congression. Knock down of various proteins involved in congression results in the same phenotypes as with SNX 4 knock down, further strengthening our hypothesis. We therefore suggest two possible molecular mechanisms for SNX 4 function in congression. The first considers that SNX 4 contributes to the stability of the mitotic <b>spindle</b> by <b>loading</b> <b>spindle</b> stabilizing proteins on to the spindle in early mitosis.

The nominal torque of the first generation device is 4 Nm, with a maximal rotation velocity of 300 degrees/s and a range of motion of ± 45 degrees. Reliability was assessed in basal condition and during loading conditions. We assessed the effects of the addition of inertia on postural tremor of the finger in a group of 26 neurological patients and the effects of wrist oscillations upon contralateral postural tremor in 6 control subjects and in 7 neurological patients exhibiting a postural tremor. Patients showed two different behaviors in response to inertia and exhibited an increased variability of postural tremor during fast oscillations (13. 3 Hz). One patient with overactivity of the olivocerebellar pathways exhibited a drop in the peak frequency of more than 20 %. The relative power of the 8 - 12 Hz subband was significantly higher in controls both in basal condition and during oscillations (p = 0. 028 and p = 0. 015, respectively). The second generation wristalyzer allows to investigate the effects of mechanical oscillations up to frequency of 50 Hz.

40|$|A counterrotating-shoulder {{mechanism}} {{has been}} proposed {{as an alternative to}} the mechanism and fixtures used in conventional friction stir welding. The mechanism would internally react most or all of the forces and torques exerted on the workpiece, making it unnecessary to react the forces and torques through massive external fixtures. In conventional friction stir welding, a rotating pin tool is inserted into, and moved along, a weld seam. As the pin tool moves, it stirs together material from the opposite sides of the seam to form the weld. A large axial plunge force must be exerted upon the workpiece through and by the pin tool and a shoulder attached above the pin tool in order to maintain the pressure necessary for the process. The workpiece is secured on top of an anvil, which supports the workpiece against the axial plunge force and against the torque exerted by the pin tool and shoulder. The anvil and associated fixtures must be made heavy (and, therefore, are expensive) to keep the workpiece stationary. In addition, workpiece geometries must be limited to those that can be accommodated by the fixtures. The predecessor of the proposed counterrotating-shoulder mechanism is a second-generation, self-reacting tool, resembling a bobbin, that makes it possible to dispense with the heavy anvil. This tool consists essentially of a rotating pin tool with opposing shoulders. Although the opposing shoulders maintain the necessary pressure without need to externally apply or react a large plunge force, the torque exerted on the workpiece remains unreacted in the absence of a substantial external fixture. Depending on the RPM and the thickness of the workpiece, the torque can be large. The proposed mechanism (see figure) would include a spindle attached to a pin tool with a lower shoulder. The spindle would be coupled via splines to the upper one of three bevel gears in a differential drive. The middle bevel gear would be the power-input gear and would be coupled to the upper and lower bevel gears. The lower bevel gear would be attached to the upper shoulder and would slide and rotate freely over the spindle. The spindle would be fastened by its threaded upper end to an external submechanism that would exert axial tension on the <b>spindle</b> to <b>load</b> the workpiece in compression between the shoulders. By reducing or eliminating (relative to the use of a self reacting tool) the torque that must be reacted externally, the use of the proposed tool would reduce the tendency toward distortion or slippage of the workpiece. To begin a weld, the spindle would be inserted through a hole in the workpiece or run-on tab at the beginning of the seam and fastened to the loading submechanism. Rotation and axial loading would be increased gradually from zero and, after a time to be determined by trial and error, translation along the weld seam would be increased gradually from zero to a steady weld speed. The weld would be ended by running the mechanism off the workpiece or, if the lower shoulder were detachable, by detaching the lower shoulder from the spindle and pulling the pin tool out...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} subject of {{titanium}} milling and identifies the need for development of titanium milling strategies to address the key process limitations of chatter and tool wear. These subjects are typically studied in isolation and little work has previously been undertaken on titanium milling dynamics. Titanium is often perceived as difficult to machine as the very properties such as high {{strength at high temperature}} and low thermal conductivity that make it an attractive engineering material can cause rapid tool wear and limit process parameters. Titanium alloys are increasingly popular within the aerospace industry due to the high strength to weight ratios and titanium and carbon fibre composites have replaced many steel and aluminium components within aerostructures. Titanium is still seen by many as expensive to process and there is not the same degree of understanding and process optimisation within the machining industry as there is for aluminium and steel alloys. The literature review considers both advances in titanium tool wear mechanisms and research into machining dynamics. From the literature review three research hypotheses are developed around the knowledge gaps pertaining to titanium milling stability and process optimisation. The limitations on milling performance and productivity are considered and three areas are identified where the research could be advanced to improve titanium milling productivity through manipulation of parameters and tool geometry, these areas are pocketing strategies, special tooling geometries and process damping. A method for controlling radial immersion for pocketing strategies is developed and it is proven that through control of parameters and toolpaths that tool life and productivity can be optimised and controlled. A study is then undertaken into the performance and modelling of variable helix end mills to explore the hypothesis that the tools will outperform standard and variable pitch cutters and that the performance can be modelled. As part of the validation process an analysis of the linearity of machine tool dynamics is undertaken and it is demonstrated that under speed and <b>load,</b> <b>spindle</b> and machine tool frequency responses can differ from those measured in the static condition. The final part of the research investigates process damping performance and sensitivity to cutting tool geometry and feed rates. A method for evaluating process damping performance is developed and through optimisation of tool geometry and feed per tooth increases in productivity up to 17 fold are demonstrated. A method is then presented for tuning machine tool dynamics to optimise process damping performance and stabilise sub optimum tooling and machine tools. The three core strands of the thesis are brought together and demonstrated in an aerospace case study. Through application of the techniques developed in the thesis a titanium aerostructural component is machined at the same rates as an equivalent steel component and at less than 50...|$|R
