5|$|The divine {{represented}} by light is a motif {{in keeping with}} the <b>sentiment</b> <b>of</b> both the Latin text on the hem of Mary's dress (which compares her beauty and radiance to that of divine light) and on the frame. A separate source of light, which also behaves as if from a divine rather than natural source, illuminates her face. The two pools of light behind her have been described as lending the painting a mystical atmosphere, indicating the presence of God. In the niche behind her, the statues are lit by two candles - symbols of the incarnation, whereas she is bathed in natural light. The artificial light adds to the overall illusion of the interior of the church, which Pächt views as achieved mainly through colour.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many of his}} countrymen, Słowacki {{decided to}} stay in France as a {{political}} refugee. In 1832 he published his first collections of poems and his first two dramas (Mindowe and Maria Stuart). He also met Mickiewicz again; reportedly, Mickiewicz approached his younger colleague and shook his hand. However, Słowacki's poems, written in the 1820s, were unpopular among his Polish compatriots, as they failed to capture the <b>sentiment</b> <b>of</b> a people living under foreign occupation. Słowacki was angered by Mickiewicz, who not only stole the limelight with his Księgi narodu polskiego i pielgrzymstwa polskiego (Books of the Polish nation and pilgrimage), but his part three of Dziady (1832) cast Słowacki's stepfather, professor Bécu, {{in the role of}} a villain. In a letter to his mother Słowacki wrote that immediately after reading that work he was ready to challenge Mickiewicz for a duel; that did not come to pass but from that moment on, Słowacki would see Mickiewicz as his main rival. Few days later, antagonized by worsening reception of his works among the Polish émigré community in Paris, including sharp criticism from Mickiewicz, Słowacki left on a trip to Geneva, Switzerland. The French authorities denied him the right to return to France {{as part of a larger}} program to rid the country of the potentially subversive Polish exiles who had settled there.|$|E
5|$|The Sermons of Swift {{have none}} of that thunder which appals, or that resistless and winning {{softness}} which melts, the hearts of an audience. He can never have enjoyed the triumph of uniting hundreds in one ardent <b>sentiment</b> <b>of</b> love, of terror, or of devotion. His reasoning, however powerful, and indeed unanswerable, convinces the understanding, but is never addressed to the heart; and, indeed, from his instructions to a young clergyman, he seems hardly to have considered pathos as a legitimate ingredient in an English sermon. Occasionally, too, Swift's misanthropic habits break out even from the pulpit; nor is he altogether able to suppress his disdain of those fellow mortals, on whose behalf was accomplished the great work of redemption. With such unamiable feelings towards his hearers, the preacher might indeed command their respect, but could never excite their sympathy. It may be feared that his Sermons were less popular from another cause, imputable more to the congregation than to the pastor. Swift spared not the vice of rich or poor; and, disdaining to amuse the imaginations of his audience with discussion of dark points of divinity, or warm them by a flow of sentimental devotion, he rushes at once {{to the point of}} moral depravity, and upbraids them with their favourite and predominant vices in a tone of stern reproof, bordering upon reproach. In short, he tears the bandages from their wounds, like the hasty surgeon of a crowded hospital, and applies the incision knife and caustic with salutary, but rough and untamed severity. But, alas! the mind must be already victorious over the worst of its evil propensities, that can profit by this harsh medicine. There is a principle of opposition in our nature, which mans itself with obstinacy even against avowed truth, when it approaches our feelings in a harsh and insulting manner. And Swift was probably sensible, that his discourses, owing to these various causes, did not produce the powerful effects most grateful to the feelings of the preacher, because they reflect back to him those of the audience.|$|E
30|$|In image {{sentiment}} classification, {{the purpose}} of our proposed method is using <b>sentiments</b> <b>of</b> whole images and important image regions to get compact deep model for predicting <b>sentiment</b> labels <b>of</b> images. In order to capture local and overall <b>sentiments</b> <b>of</b> images in model learning, we propose a deep CNN-based framework that can extract and integrate <b>sentiments</b> <b>of</b> whole images and important image regions for sentiment classification learning. For the challenge of getting compact deep model in training, group sparse regularization is used for image sentiment classification learning.|$|R

25|$|In 2015, President Dilma Rousseff {{approved}} the Feminicide Law that altered the Brazilian Criminal Code to preview the feminicide as type of homicide and a hideous crime.

25|$|The anti-Chinese <b>sentiment</b> <b>of</b> the Nanyang has {{subsided}} {{in recent}} years as Chinese influence results in prosperous rather than communist results. This has generated amongst many Nanyang-Chinese the will to rediscover their cultural identity in line with the emerging China of the north. One of the impacts of this rediscovery in the Nanyang region, is a boom in Mandarin classes.|$|E

25|$|The {{liability}} for negligence … is no doubt based upon a general public <b>sentiment</b> <b>of</b> moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay … The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the lawyer's question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee {{would be likely to}} injure your neighbour.|$|E
25|$|However, as a niche {{commercial}} publishing industry for machine-printed illustrated envelopes subsequently developed in Britain and elsewhere, {{it is likely}} that it was the <b>sentiment</b> <b>of</b> the illustration that provoked the ridicule and led to their withdrawal. Indeed, in the absence of examples of machine-printed illustrated envelopes prior to this it may be appropriate to recognise the Mulready envelope as a significant innovation in its own right. Machine-printed illustrated envelopes are a mainstay of the direct mail industry.|$|E

25|$|The initial {{problems}} were obvious: the congregations soon grew in number, but were far apart; {{there were not}} nearly enough ministers; the church was treated in a hostile manner by the United Free Church; work was conducted under considerable hardship; and there was little success in appealing to the general popular <b>sentiment</b> <b>of</b> Scotland. However, the revenue of the church gradually increased; in 1901, the sustentation fund was able to support only 75 ministers, but by 1903 it maintained 167.|$|E
25|$|An orphan since youth, Luo Qing {{was raised}} by {{relatives}} and became a soldier. At the age of twenty-eight, for his distressful <b>sentiment</b> <b>of</b> forlornness, he went on a spiritual quest and studied with several teachers, although {{he was unable to}} establish permanent relationships. Only at the age of forty, apparently without a direct guidance of a teacher, he reached enlightenment: awareness to be united with the absolute principle of reality. He began gathering disciples and wrote the Wubuliuce ("Five Instructions in Six Books"), first printed in 1527.|$|E
25|$|Haggard's {{childhood}} was troubled {{after the death}} of his father, and he was incarcerated several times in his youth.

Between the 1960s and the 1980s, he had 38 number-one hits on the US country charts, several of which also made the Billboard all-genre singles chart. Haggard continued to release successful albums into the 2000s.|$|E

25|$|Initially, the <b>sentiment</b> <b>of</b> Louis XIV {{towards the}} Ottoman Empire {{seems to have}} been quite negative, and French troops {{assisted}} the Austrians against the Turks at the 1664 Battle of Saint-Gothard, or the Venetians against the Turks at the Siege of Candia in 1669 under François de Beaufort. One of the reasons was that Louis XIV was in a shifting alliance with the Habsburgs, especially through his marriage with Marie-Thérèse of Spain in 1660. Louis XIV's mother, Anne of Austria, was a Habsburg too.|$|E
25|$|Finland's support from, and {{coordination}} with, Nazi Germany starting {{during the winter}} of 1940–41 and made other countries considerably less sympathetic to the Finnish cause; particularly since the Continuation War led to a Finnish invasion of the Soviet Union designed not only to recover lost territory, but additionally to answer the irredentist <b>sentiment</b> <b>of</b> a Greater Finland by incorporating East Karelia, whose inhabitants were culturally related to the Finnish people, although Eastern Orthodox by religion. This invasion had caused Britain to declare war on Finland on 6 December 1941.|$|E
25|$|Collins, {{the son of}} {{a cattle}} dealer, grew up in a middle class Irish family in Camlough, a small, staunchly Irish republican town in South Armagh. Despite the <b>sentiment</b> <b>of</b> the area, the Collins family had no {{association}} and little interest in Irish Nationalist politics. Collins' mother was devout Catholic, and he was brought up under her influence with a sense of awe for the martyrs of that religion in Irish history, in its conflicts with Protestantism.After completing his schooling, Collins worked for a time in the Ministry of Defence in a clerical capacity in London before studying Law at Queen's University, where he became influenced by Marxist political ideology.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the liquor controversy growing in the province, there was another testing of citizens' sentiment on an issue. The government decided to hold a plebiscite among egg producers {{on whether or not}} to establish a compulsory egg marketing board. That plebiscite was originally to be held in June 1957, but Leonard Halmrast, the Minister of Agriculture, decided to hold it in conjunction with the liquor plebiscite so that the <b>sentiment</b> <b>of</b> Egg producers could be tested {{at the same time as}} voters for the liquor plebiscite, to save costs. That decision later led to controversy when numerous producers were missed after the plan was defeated in a close vote.|$|E
25|$|In their {{submissions}} to the NSC, Krulak {{presented an}} extremely optimistic {{report on the}} progress of the war, while Mendenhall presented a very bleak picture of military failure and public discontent. Krulak disregarded the effects of popular discontent in combating the Viet Cong. The general felt that the Vietnamese soldiers' efforts in the field would not be affected by the public's unease with Diệm's policies. Mendenhall focused on gauging the <b>sentiment</b> <b>of</b> urban-based Vietnamese and concluded that Diệm's policies increased the possibility of religious civil war. Mendenhall said that Diệm's policies were causing the South Vietnamese to believe that life under the Viet Cong would improve the quality of their lives.|$|E
25|$|Professor George Buchanan Gray of Mansfield College, Oxford, in {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, wrote that the Israelite men's {{participation}} in the sacrificial feasts followed their intimacy with the women, who then naturally invited their paramours to their feasts, which, according to custom, were sacrificial occasions. Gray considered {{that it would have}} been in accord with the <b>sentiment</b> <b>of</b> early Israelites to worship the Moabite god on his own territory. Similalry, Professor Frymer-Kensky of Chicago University wrote that the cataclysm began with a dinner invitation from the Moabite women, who perhaps wanted to be friendly with the people whom Balaam had tried, but failed, to curse.|$|E
