25|$|Challenge {{of gifts}} (Schenkungsanfechtung / cas de libéralités): Gratuitous or {{effectively}} gratuitous transfers of assets by the debtor may be challenged if they took place {{within a year}} prior to the <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> or the bankruptcy. Good-faith recipients of a gift must return it {{only to the extent}} that they remain enriched by it.|$|E
25|$|Challenge of {{deliberate}} disadvantagement (Absichtsanfechtung / cas de dol): Any other acts by the debtor may be challenged if they took place {{within five years}} prior to the <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> or the bankruptcy, and if they occurred in the debtor's manifest intent to disadvantage his creditors or to benefit certain creditors to the disadvantage of others.|$|E

25|$|Debt {{collection}} by bankruptcy (Betreibung auf Konkurs / poursuite par voie de faillite): If {{the debt}} is not secured, {{and if the}} debtor is a registered commercial entity (such as a corporation), bankruptcy proceedings ensue. Under special circumstances, other persons can be subject to bankruptcy proceedings as well. For the settlement of certain debts (such as tax debts) a <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> takes place instead of bankruptcy.|$|E
25|$|Challenge of {{over-indebtedness}} (Überschuldungsanfechtung / cas de surendettement): Certain acts of {{the debtor}} that impart an unfair preference to another creditor, such as the securing of a previously unsecured debt, may be challenged if they took place within a year prior to the <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> or the bankruptcy, if the debtor was already over-indebted {{at the time and}} if the other creditor cannot prove that he could not have been aware of the over-indebtedness.|$|E
25|$|The <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> is {{initiated}} by {{an application for}} continuation (Fortsetzungsbegehren / demande de continuation) filed by the creditor with the DCO.

50|$|The November Revolution {{ended the}} reign of the ruling dynasties in Germany. These found {{themselves}} in a position of having to abdicate power and, given the new overall political situation, did this voluntarily or were deposed. Their property was seized, but they were not immediately dispossessed, in contrast to the situation in Austria.There were no <b>seizures</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> at the national level because there was no corresponding property. The national authorities did not implement a nationwide policy but left it up to the individual states. In addition the Council of the People's Deputies was concerned that any such <b>seizures</b> <b>of</b> property might encourage the victors to lay claim to the confiscated estates for reparations.|$|R
25|$|Creditors {{who hold}} a {{certificate}} of unpaid debts against the debtor, or creditors in a bankruptcy, may file suit against third parties who have benefited from unfair preferences or fraudulent transfers by the debtor prior to a <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> or a bankruptcy. If the challenge succeeds, the third party must return the assets formerly belonging to the debtor to the DBO or the BO, {{as the case may}} be, and the debtor may also be liable for criminal prosecution for bankruptcy fraud.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> {{hostile to}} the state– {{especially}} Jewish assets – in Austria, paintings and other artwork of great value, among other things, have been confiscated.

The Führer plans to personally decide {{on the use of the}} property after its seizure. He is considering putting artwork first and foremost at the disposal of small Austrian towns for their collections.|$|E
25|$|The {{investigation}} {{continued into}} the 1994 bombing of the Argentine Jewish Mutual Aid Association (AMIA) building in Buenos Aires that killed 85 persons. In May 2008 a federal prosecutor called for the indictment of former President Carlos Menem, former federal judge Juan Galeano, and others for their alleged role in covering up and protecting {{those involved in the}} attack. Subsequently, the presiding federal judge, following recommendations from the AMIA Special Prosecutor, issued an international request for the <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> belonging to eight Iranians and Hezbollah to cover damages being claimed by the civil suit brought against the perpetrators. In December the judge ordered the seizure of six commercial properties allegedly belonging to a former Iranian cultural attache who was among those accused of aiding in the attack.|$|E
50|$|Miguel Figueroa, {{acting on}} behalf of the Communist Party's membership, {{challenged}} these provisions in the Act, arguing that the 50-candidate rule, combined with the increase in candidate deposits - which for smaller parties would be only partially refundable - and the <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> party <b>assets,</b> together constituted draconian and unfair discrimination against smaller political parties. In 1999, Justice Anne Molloy of the Superior Court of Ontario (General Division) struck down many of the Act's provisions as unconstitutional, including the <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> party <b>assets</b> and the non-refundability of candidate deposits for those failing to garner at least 15% of the vote in an election. Justice Molloy also struck down the 50-candidate threshold requirement for federal parties to maintain their registration.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the advent}} of the {{charging}} order, a creditor pursuing a partner in a partnership was able to obtain from the court a writ of execution directly against the partnership’s assets, which led to the <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> such <b>assets</b> by the sheriff. This result was possible because the partnership itself was not treated as a juridical person, but simply as an aggregate of its partners. The <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> partnership <b>assets</b> was usually carried out by the sheriff, who would go down to the partnership’s place of business and shut it down. That caused the non-debtor partners to suffer financial losses, sometimes on par with the debtor partner, and the process was considered to be entirely “clumsy.” ...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between a creditor and a sovereign debtor {{is described as}} a ‘one-shot’ game with discrete actions—total or no debt-repudiation and <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>asset</b> holding abroad. Possible Nash equilibria where each player chooses an action as to maximise his expected payoff given his beliefs about the other player’s action and the implications of those actions on the players’ trustworthy reputation are identified. However, if reputation losses vary convexly with the players’ relative hostility, partial repudiation and seizure might be the preferred strategies. The preferred repudiation and seizure rates are analysed under asymmetric and symmetric information {{about the state of the}} world...|$|R
25|$|The {{issue of}} Jewish {{refugees}} from Arab lands {{continues to be}} on the World Jewish Congress agenda today. The WJC website states that “The plight of Jews who fled from, or still live in, Arab lands and their specific concerns are not well-known and need to be raised with governments and international organizations. Where illegal <b>seizure</b> <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> took place, these should be returned to their former owners, or adequate compensation should be paid. Jews remaining in Arab lands, as well as other religious minorities, should be granted religious freedom and allowed to practice their faith according to their traditions. Jewish communal sites in Arab countries must be preserved and respected.” The WJC believes that the plight of the Jewish refugees from Arab lands has been neglected for decades by the international community, including governments and international organizations.|$|E
