The hyphen included between “student” and “athletes” indicates that they are theoretically both, but reality often differs. Universities rely on athletic and academic advisors to help student-athletes succeed in both areas; however, problems arise when the advisors {{have to choose between}} prioritizing the students’ education and sport.

But how much of that {{can be attributed to the}} advisors? The current study examined the dynamic that exists between student-athletes and advisors at NCAA Division I universities.

Athletic advisors were interviewed regarding their approach in advising student-athletes. Data gathered shed light on the complexities of the academic advising process for student-athletes...|$|E
