In this work we undertake a rigorous analysis of whether gradient descent on the squared loss of an autoencoder can solve the dictionary learning problem. The "Autoencoder" architecture we consider is a R^n →R^n mapping with a single ReLU activation layer of size h. Under very mild distributional assumptions on x^*, we prove that the norm of the expected gradient of the <b>standard</b> <b>squared</b> loss function is asymptotically (in sparse code dimension) negligible for all points in a small neighborhood of A^*. This is supported with experimental evidence using synthetic data. We also conduct experiments to suggest that A^* is a local minimum. Along the way we prove that a layer of ReLU gates can be set up to automatically recover the support of the sparse codes. This property holds independent of the loss function. We believe that it could be of independent interest. Comment: In this new version of the paper with a small change in the distributional assumptions we are actually able to prove the asymptotic criticality of a neighbourhood of the ground truth dictionary for even just the <b>standard</b> <b>squared</b> loss of the ReLU autoencoder (unlike the regularized loss in the older version...|$|R
