5|$|Campbell had {{previously}} utilised the condition {{discovered in the}} work of Oliver Heaviside for lossless transmission to improve the frequency response of transmission lines using lumped component inductors (loading coils). When Campbell started investigating electric wave filter design from 1910, this previous work naturally led him to filters using ladder network topology using capacitors and inductors. Low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters were designed. Sharper cut-offs and higher <b>stop-band</b> rejection to any arbitrary design specification could be achieved merely by increasing the length of the ladder. The filter designs used by Campbell were described by Zobel as constant k filters although this was not a term used by Campbell himself.|$|E
5|$|Around 1923, Zobel's filter {{designs were}} {{reaching}} {{the peak of}} their complexity. He now had a filter section {{to which he had}} doubly applied the m-derivation process resulting in filter sections which he called the mm'-type. This had all the advantages of the previous m-type, but more so. An even faster transition into the <b>stop-band</b> and an even more constant characteristic impedance in the pass-band. At the same time one side would match into the old m-type, just as the m-type could match into the k-type. Because there were now two arbitrary parameters (m and m') that the filter designer could adjust, much better end matching half-sections could be designed. A composite filter using these sections would have been the very best that could have been achieved at that time. However, the mm'-type sections never became as widespread and well known as the m-type sections, possibly because their greater complexity has deterred designers. They would have been inconvenient to implement with microwave technology and the increased count of components, especially wound components, made them more expensive to implement with conventional LC technology. Certainly, it is hard to find a textbook from any period which covers their design.|$|E

Based on the required BER level, the required average PSD level of the generated sequence for each channel (corresponding to each shared frequency <b>stop-bands)</b> is fixed at − 30 dB. The PSD of MAT within the shared frequency <b>stop-bands</b> behaves unsteadily and irregularly; besides, the suppression bandwidth is much more narrow than the required bandwidth. SCAN can achieve at least − 15 dB, but at most − 20 dB, whereas the spectrums of the generated sequence by CAN, CYC, and FRE show no suppression abilities on the <b>stop-bands,</b> because these three algorithms optimize the SIR of the radar system by designing the receive filters adaptively. For CYC and FRE, the PSD levels within the <b>stop-bands</b> are even higher than those out of the <b>stop-bands.</b> It {{is fair to say}} that GFT behaves better than the other five algorithms, and it almost achieves the required level: the PSD comes to at least − 24 dB, at most − 27 dB for each channel in average.|$|R

In the <b>stop-bands,</b> instead, eigenfrequencies relative to localized modes may be found. Furthermore, we use an asymptotic reduced model, whereby the cracked solid is approximated by a beam with elastic connections. This model allows to derive the dynamic properties of damaged solids through analytical methods. By comparing the theoretical dispersion curves yielded by the asymptotic reduced model with the numerical outcomes obtained from finite element computations, we observe that the asymptotic reduced model provides a better fit to the numerical data as the slenderness ratio increases. Finally, we illustrate how the limits of the <b>stop-bands</b> vary with the depth of the cracks...|$|R

50|$|Before 1987, {{one-dimensional}} photonic crystals in {{the form}} of periodic multi-layer dielectric stacks (such as the Bragg mirror) were studied extensively. Lord Rayleigh started their study in 1887, by showing that such systems have a one-dimensional photonic band-gap, a spectral range of large reflectivity, known as a <b>stop-band.</b> Today, such structures are used in a diverse range of applications—from reflective coatings to enhancing LED efficiency to highly reflective mirrors in certain laser cavities (see, for example, VCSEL). A detailed theoretical study of one-dimensional optical structures was performed by Vladimir P. Bykov, who was the first to investigate the effect of a photonic band-gap on the spontaneous emission from atoms and molecules embedded within the photonic structure. Bykov also speculated as to what could happen if two- or three-dimensional periodic optical structures were used. The concept of three-dimensional photonic crystals was then discussed by Ohtaka in 1979, who also developed a formalism for the calculation of the photonic band structure. However, these ideas did not take off until after the publication of two milestone papers in 1987 by Yablonovitch and John. Both these papers concerned high-dimensional periodic optical structures, i.e., photonic crystals. Yablonovitch's main goal was to engineer photonic density of states to control the spontaneous emission of materials embedded in the photonic crystal. John's idea was to use photonic crystals to affect localisation and control of light.|$|E
