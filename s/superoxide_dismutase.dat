5|$|Copper {{is needed}} by the body {{for a number of}} functions, {{predominantly}} as a cofactor for a number of enzymes such as ceruloplasmin, cytochrome c oxidase, dopamine β-hydroxylase, <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutase</b> and tyrosinase.|$|E
5|$|To {{balance the}} {{oxidative}} state, {{plants and animals}} maintain complex systems of overlapping antioxidants, such as glutathione and enzymes (e.g., catalase and <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutase)</b> produced internally or the dietary antioxidants: vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin E.|$|E
5|$|To {{counteract}} these reactive oxygen species, cells contain numerous antioxidant systems, including antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin C {{and vitamin}} E, and antioxidant enzymes such as <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutase,</b> catalase, and peroxidases, which detoxify the reactive species, limiting {{damage to the}} cell.|$|E

40|$|The {{catalytic}} activity of wild type Escherichia coli Cu,Zn <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutases</b> and of two mutants {{in which two}} lysine residues conserved in most bacterial Cu,Zn <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutases</b> {{have been replaced by}} serine was investigated by pulse radiolysis and Brownian dynamics simulations. Experimental and computational data show that neutralization of Lys 60 strongly reduces the {{catalytic activity}} of the enzyme (similar to 50 %), indicating that this residue has a primary role in the electrostatic attraction of the substrate towards the catalytic copper. Neutralization of Lys 63 does not significantly influence the catalytic rate constant. The results suggest that prokaryotic Cu,Zn <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutases</b> have evolved an electrostatic mechanism to facilitate the enzyme-substrate encounter that is functionally equivalent to that already found in the eukaryotic enzymes.

5|$|Oxidative {{damage in}} DNA can cause cancer. Several {{antioxidant}} enzymes such as <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutase,</b> catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase etc. protect DNA from oxidative stress. It {{has been proposed}} that polymorphisms in these enzymes are associated with DNA damage and subsequently the individual's risk of cancer susceptibility.|$|E
5|$|Ethanol {{extracts}} of {{the fruit}} body are high in antioxidant activity, and have been shown in laboratory tests to have anti-inflammatory activity comparable to the drug diclofenac. Studies with mouse models have also demonstrated hepatoprotective (liver-protecting) ability, possibly by restoring diminished levels of the antioxidant enzymes <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutase</b> and catalase caused by experimental exposure to the liver-damaging chemical carbon tetrachloride.|$|E
5|$|Manganese is an {{important}} element for human health, essential for development, metabolism, and the antioxidant system. Nevertheless, excessive exposure or intake {{may lead to a}} condition known as manganism, a neurodegenerative disorder that causes dopaminergic neuronal death and symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease. The classes of enzymes that have manganese cofactors is large and includes oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, ligases, lectins, and integrins. The reverse transcriptases of many retroviruses (though not lentiviruses such as HIV) contain manganese. The best-known manganese-containing polypeptides may be arginase, the diphtheria toxin, and Mn-containing <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutase</b> (Mn-SOD).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe iron- and manganese-containing <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutases</b> {{have very}} similar {{three-dimensional}} structures {{but can be}} distinguished by various biochemical means. The primary structures of six manganese-containing and three iron-containing <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutases</b> are known. Analysis of the aligned amino acid sequences of these enzymes taken together with structural data from X-ray diffraction studies demonstrates that the two classes of enzyme can be distinguished {{on the basis of}} a small number of single-site substitutions that are positioned in and close to the active site of the enzyme...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial and {{eukaryotic}} Cu,Zn <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutases</b> show remarkable {{differences in}} the active site region and in their quaternary structure organization. We report here a functional comparison between four Cu,Zn <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutases</b> from Gram-negative bacteria and the eukaryotic bovine enzyme. Our data indicate that bacterial dimeric variants are characterized by catalytic rates {{higher than that of}} the bovine enzyme, probably due to the solvent accessibility of their active site. Prokaryotic Cu,Zn <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutases</b> also show higher resistance to hydrogen peroxide inactivation and lower HCO 3 - -dependent peroxidative activity. Moreover, unlike the eukaryotic enzyme, all bacterial variants are susceptible to inactivation by chelating agents and show variable sensitivity to proteolytic attack, with the E. coli monomeric enzyme showing higher rates of inactivation by EDTA and proteinase K. We suggest that differences between individual bacterial variants could be due to the influence of modifications at the dimer interface on the enzyme conformational flexibility...|$|R
5|$|Research {{conducted}} in 2003 suggests that extracts from Polyozellus multiplex may have suppressive effects on stomach cancer. The {{study showed that}} feeding a low concentration (0.5% or 1%) of the mushroom extract enhanced {{the activities of the}} enzymes glutathione S-transferase and <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutase,</b> and increased the abundance of the molecule glutathione. The extract also augmented the expression of the protein p53. All of these substances protect the human organism against cancer. Additional studies reported in 2004 and 2006 attribute anti-tumor properties to polyozellin.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{bioluminescence}} {{is caused}} by the action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). Several studies have evaluated the biochemical basis of light production in Panellus stipticus, and concluded that there is no specific fungal luciferase. The fungus was shown in 1988 to contain the sesquiterpene panal, which has a cadinene keto-aldehyde chemical structure. Later, two additional precursors were isolated, PS-A (1-O-decanoylpanal) and PS-B (1-O-dodecanoylpanal). If these compounds are treated with salt of ammonia or primary amines in the presence of iron(II), hydrogen peroxide, and a cationic surfactant, light is emitted by a chemiluminescence reaction, suggesting that panal and its derivatives are fungal luciferins, and that the chemiluminescence reaction is the cause of in vivo bioluminescence. In the fungus, the level of activity of the enzyme <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutase</b> (SOD) appears to {{play a critical role in}} the amount of light emission. SOD quenches the effect of the superoxide (O2−) anion required in the reaction, and thus SOD activity has to be inhibited for the reaction to occur.|$|E
5|$|Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are a {{class of}} closely related enzymes that {{catalyze}} {{the breakdown of the}} superoxide anion into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. SOD enzymes are present in almost all aerobic cells and in extracellular fluids. <b>Superoxide</b> <b>dismutase</b> enzymes contain metal ion cofactors that, depending on the isozyme, can be copper, zinc, manganese or iron. In humans, the copper/zinc SOD is present in the cytosol, while manganese SOD is present in the mitochondrion. There also exists a third form of SOD in extracellular fluids, which contains copper and zinc in its active sites. The mitochondrial isozyme seems to be the most biologically important of these three, since mice lacking this enzyme die soon after birth. In contrast, the mice lacking copper/zinc SOD (Sod1) are viable but have numerous pathologies and a reduced lifespan (see article on superoxide), while mice without the extracellular SOD have minimal defects (sensitive to hyperoxia). In plants, SOD isozymes are present in the cytosol and mitochondria, with an iron SOD found in chloroplasts that is absent from vertebrates and yeast.|$|E
40|$|Isolated human {{polymorphonuclear}} leukocytes {{were found}} to contain two distinct <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutases,</b> electrophoretically identical to the <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutases</b> found in other human tissues. One is inhibited by cyanide and {{is located in the}} cytosol. The other is not inhibited by cyanide and is mitochondrial. These findings disagree with reports by other laboratories, which did not find the cyanide-sensitive cytoplasmic enzyme. The superoxide dismutase-containing preparation of leukocytes released large amounts of superoxide into the medium when the cells were phagocytizing, suggesting that, if the cell population is homogeneous, superoxide production probably takes place on the outer surface of the cell membrane, in addition to inside the phagocytic vacuole...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{modification}} of bovine and yeast Cu,Zn <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutases</b> with phenylglyoxal diminishes the catalytic activities by {{greater than or}} equal to 98 %, and treatment of these enzymes with butanedione plus borate leads to {{greater than or equal}} to 96 % inactivation. The activity loss is accompanied by the {{modification of}} less than two arginine residues per subunit with no concomitant loss of Cu or Zn. The phenylglyoxal-modified enzymes require at least a 20 -fold greater concentration of cyanide for 50 % inhibition than do the corresponding native enzymes. Polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and activity staining of the phenylglyoxal-inactivated enzymes demonstrate that the residual activity is largely associated with modified forms that bear lower net positive charge than the native <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutases...</b>|$|R
50|$|Host immune {{defenses}} {{are capable of}} producing superoxide, which has a tremendous detrimental effect on the worm. However, {{they are able to}} produce a number of antioxidant proteins that block the effect of superoxide. Schistosomes have four <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutases,</b> and levels of these proteins increase as the schistosome develops and matures.|$|R
5|$|The {{efficiency}} of an enzyme {{can be expressed}} in terms of kcat/Km. This is also called the specificity constant and incorporates the rate constants for all steps in the reaction up to and including the first irreversible step. Because the specificity constant reflects both affinity and catalytic ability, it is useful for comparing different enzymes against each other, or the same enzyme with different substrates. The theoretical maximum for the specificity constant is called the diffusion limit and is about 108 to 109 (M−1 s−1). At this point every collision of the enzyme with its substrate will result in catalysis, and the rate of product formation is not limited by the reaction rate but by the diffusion rate. Enzymes with this property are called catalytically perfect or kinetically perfect. Example of such enzymes are triose-phosphate isomerase, carbonic anhydrase, acetylcholinesterase, catalase, fumarase, β-lactamase, and <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutase.</b> The turnover of such enzymes can reach several million reactions per second.|$|E
5|$|In human cells, and {{eukaryotic}} {{cells in}} general, DNA {{is found in}} two cellular locations— inside the nucleus and inside the mitochondria. Nuclear DNA (nDNA) exists as chromatin during non-replicative stages of the cell cycle and is condensed into aggregate structures known as chromosomes during cell division. In either state the DNA is highly compacted and wound up around bead-like proteins called histones. Whenever a cell needs to express the genetic information encoded in its nDNA the required chromosomal region is unravelled, genes located therein are expressed, and then the region is condensed back to its resting conformation. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is located inside mitochondria organelles, exists in multiple copies, and is also tightly associated {{with a number of}} proteins to form a complex known as the nucleoid. Inside mitochondria, reactive oxygen species (ROS), or free radicals, byproducts of the constant production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation, create a highly oxidative environment that is known to damage mtDNA. A critical enzyme in counteracting the toxicity of these species is <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutase,</b> which is present in both the mitochondria and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the structural/functional {{role of the}} dimeric structure in Cu,Zn <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutases,</b> we have studied the stability {{to a variety of}} agents of the Escherichia coli enzyme, the only monomeric variant of this class so far isolated, Differential scanning calorimetry of the native enzyme showed the presence of two well defined peaks identified as the metal free and holoprotein, Unlike dimeric Cu,Zn <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutases,</b> the unfolding of the monomeric enzyme was found to be highly reversible, a behavior that may be explained by the absence of free cysteines and the highly polar nature of its molecular surface. The melting temperature of the E. coli enzyme was found to be pH-dependent with the holoenzyme transition centered at 66 degrees C at pH 7. 8 and at 79. 3 degrees C at pH 6. 0, The active-site metals, which were easily displaced from the active site by EDTA, were found to enhance the thermal stability of the monomeric apoprotein but to a lower extent than in the dimeric enzymes from eukaryotic sources, Apo-superoxide dismutase from E. coli was shown to be nearly as stable as the bovine apoenzyme, whose hole form is much more stable and less sensitive to pH variations. The remarkable pH susceptibility of the E. coli enzyme structure was paralleled by the slow decrease in activity of the enzyme incubated at alkaline pH and by modification of the EPR spectrum at lower pH values than in the case of dimeric enzymes, Unlike eukaryotic Cu,Zn <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutases,</b> the active-site structure of the E. coli enzyme was shown to be reversibly perturbed by urea, These observations suggest that the conformational stability of Cu,Zn <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutases</b> is largely due to the intrinsic stability of the beta-barrel fold rather than to the dimeric structure and that pH sensitivity and weak metal binding of the E. coli enzyme are due to higher flexibility and accessibility to the solvent of its active-site region...|$|R

25|$|In mice, the {{extracellular}} <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutase</b> (SOD3, ecSOD) {{contributes to}} the development of hypertension. Diminished SOD3 activity has been linked to lung diseases such as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) or Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).|$|E
25|$|Human {{white blood}} cells use enzymes such as NADPH oxidase to {{generate}} superoxide and other reactive oxygen species to kill bacteria. During infection, some bacteria (e.g., Burkholderia pseudomallei) therefore produce <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutase</b> {{to protect themselves from}} being killed.|$|E
50|$|The enzymatic {{components}} may directly scavenge {{active oxygen}} species or may act by producing the nonenzymatic antioxidants. There are four enzymes {{that provide the}} bulk of protection against deleterious reactions involving active oxygen in bacteria: SODs (<b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutases</b> encoded by sodA and sodB), catalases (katE and katG), glutathione synthetase (gshAB) and glutathione reductase (gor). Some bacteria have NADH-dependent peroxidases specific for H2O2.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{oxidative}} burst {{produced by the}} NADPH oxidase (Phox) is an essential weapon used by host cells to eradicate engulfed pathogens. In Salmonella typhimurium, oxidative stress resistance has been previously proposed to be mediated by the pathogenicity island 2 type III secretion system (T 3 SS- 2), periplasmic <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutases</b> and cytoplasmic catalases/peroxidases. Here, we fused an OxyR-dependent promoter to the gfp to build the ahpC-gfp transcriptional fusion. This reporter was used to monitor hydrogen peroxide levels as sensed by Salmonella {{during the course of}} an infection. We showed that the expression of this fusion was under the exclusive control of reactive oxygen species produced by the host. The ahpC-gfp expression was noticeably modified in the absence of bacterial periplasmic <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutases</b> or cytoplasmic catalases/peroxidases. Surprisingly, inactivation of the T 3 SS- 2 had no effect on the ahpC-gfp expression. All together, these results led to a model in which Salmonella resistance relies on its arsenal of detoxifying enzymes to cope with Phox-mediated oxidative stress...|$|R
50|$|SOD1 binds {{copper and}} zinc ions {{and is one}} of three <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutases</b> {{responsible}} for destroying free superoxide radicals in the body. The encoded isozyme is a soluble cytoplasmic and mitochondrial intermembrane space protein, acting as a homodimer to convert naturally occurring, but harmful, superoxide radicals to molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide can then be broken down by another enzyme called catalase.|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} major {{families}} of <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutase,</b> {{depending on the}} protein fold and the metal cofactor: the Cu/Zn type (which binds both copper and zinc), Fe and Mn types (which bind either iron or manganese), and the Ni type (which binds nickel).|$|E
25|$|Jiaogulan {{has been}} found to {{increase}} expression <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutase</b> (SOD), which is a powerful endogenous cellular antioxidant enzyme. Studies have found that it increases the activities of macrophages, T lymphocytes, and natural killer cells and that it acts as a tumor inhibitor.|$|E
25|$|The high {{efficiency}} of <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutase</b> seems necessary: {{even at the}} subnanomolar concentrations achieved by the high concentrations of SOD within cells, superoxide inactivates the citric acid cycle enzyme aconitase, can poison energy metabolism, and releases potentially toxic iron. Aconitase {{is one of several}} iron-sulfur-containing (de)hydratases in metabolic pathways shown to be inactivated by superoxide.|$|E
40|$|Metal-dependent <b>superoxide</b> <b>dismutases</b> (SODs) with a {{specific}} requirement for a manganese or iron ion for catalytic activity and copper- and zinc-dependent enzymes are essential for detoxification of superoxide anion radicals.
