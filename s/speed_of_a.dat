5|$|Christiansen (1998) {{estimated}} that the leg bones of Tyrannosaurus were not significantly stronger than those of elephants, which are relatively limited in their top speed and never actually run (there is no airborne phase), and hence proposed that the dinosaur's maximum speed would have been about , {{which is about the}} <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> human sprinter. But he also noted that such estimates depend on many dubious assumptions.|$|E

5|$|Thompson {{begins by}} showing that an animal's surface and volume (or weight) {{increase}} with the square and cube of its length, respectively, and deducing simple rules for how bodies will change with size. He shows {{in a few short}} equations that the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fish or ship rises with the square root of its length. He then derives the slightly more complex scaling laws for birds or aircraft in flight. He shows that an organism thousands of times smaller than a bacterium is essentially impossible.|$|E

5|$|With {{regard to}} hurricanes, it was {{hypothesized}} that by seeding the area around the eyewall with silver iodide, latent heat would be released. This would promote the formation of a new eyewall. As this new eyewall was larger than the old eyewall, the winds of the tropical cyclone would be weaker due to a reduced pressure gradient. Even a small reduction in the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hurricane's winds would be beneficial: since the damage potential of a hurricane increased as the square of the wind speed, a slight lowering of wind speed would have a large reduction in destructiveness.|$|E
5|$|In 1868, the Scottish {{shipbuilder}} John Elder {{published an}} article that advocated that widening the beam of a ship would reduce the area {{that needed to be}} protected and allow it to carry thicker armour and heavier, more powerful guns in comparison to a normal ship. In addition such a ship would have a shallower draught and only a moderate increase in power would be required to match the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> normal ship. Sir Edward Reed, then Director of Naval Construction of the Royal Navy, agreed with Elder's conclusions. Rear-Admiral Andrei Alexandrovich Popov of the Imperial Russian Navy further expanded on Elder's concept by broadening the ship so that it was actually circular and he made the design flat-bottomed, unlike Elder's convex hull, to minimise its draught.|$|E
5|$|Several teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. Red Bull introduced a revised version of its RB6 chassis for Vettel as his previous monocoque had a small defect which created handling difficulties in Monaco. The team tested a version of McLaren's F-duct system (which increases the top <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> car) during the Friday practice sessions but removed it for qualifying and the race because both of McLaren's drivers found the device difficult to operate. Ferrari modified their F-duct system so that it would allow their drivers to operate the system by using their left leg. Mercedes arrived at the circuit by reverting to a previous specification of suspension and introduced a longer wheelbase on both their cars as well as a new version of their F-duct system. Williams decided to revert to an old specification of their front wing following accidents involving their drivers in Monaco, though the team brought new brake ducts. Lotus débuted a new rear wing specification which improved forward balance of their chassis. Virgin managed to procure a longer-wheelbase version of the VR-01 for Lucas di Grassi after the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull prevented them from having two cars prepared in time for the previous race.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Studies of {{the effect}} of {{aerodynamic}} pressure on the maximum permissible <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> high-speed train on the existing railway infrastructure. Methodology. The study of the magnitude and direction of the aerodynamic pressure, its effect on the maximum <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> high-speed train was carried out on a train model composed of axisymmetric bodies with conical forms of head and tail parts. Findings. Determined the values of the aerodynamic pressure at different distances from the train are, when the high-speed train moves at <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> 200 km/h or more. The maximum <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> high-speed train are determined taking into account the state of the infrastructure of the existing railway, ensuring the safe operation <b>of</b> <b>a</b> high-speed railway. Originality. Theoretical studies of aerodynamic pressure from secondary air currents formed during the movement of high-speed trains are performed on <b>a</b> model <b>of</b> <b>a</b> train composed <b>of</b> identical axisymmetric bodies with conical forms of head and tail moving in a compressible medium. The results of the research allow the regularity of the change in aerodynamic pressure during the movement <b>of</b> <b>a</b> high-speed train. Practical value. The obtained results allow to establish: 1) the maximum permissible <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> high-speed train taking into account the technical condition of permanent devices and structures of the existing railway infrastructure; 2) technical parameters of individual objects and structural elements of the infrastructure of high-speed iron subjected to the effect of aerodynamic pressure for <b>a</b> given maximum <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> high-speed trains...|$|R
