5|$|On {{hearing the}} ambush in the distance, Dodge hurried on toward Fort Hamilton (present-day Wiota, Wisconsin) where he {{gathered}} together {{a company of}} 29 mounted volunteers and sped off to intercept the attackers. He led the chase through tangled underbrush until, breaking into prairie, his force caught <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> raiding party. The Kickapoo crossed the Pecatonica River within <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pursuing militia, and entered into an overgrown swamp. The militia followed across the swollen river and dismounted {{when they reached the}} swamp.|$|E
5|$|Akhtab {{eventually}} {{managed to}} enter and persuade them that the Muslims would surely be overwhelmed.

5|$|Gibraltar {{was part}} of a 17-ship squadron, keeping four French ships-of-the-line in Fort Royal, Martinique, when on 29April 1781 a 20-ship fleet and a {{merchant}} convoy under Contre-amiral François deGrasse arrived from Brest. Out of <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British, deGrasse put a man ashore to swap information with Fort Royal's garrison, and agree on a plan of attack with the blockaded ships.|$|E

5|$|Scholar John Lindow {{proposes that}} a {{potentially}} understated mythological importance of Sif's {{role in the}} story of her sheared hair exists; her headpiece is created along with the most important and powerful items in Norse mythology.

5|$|The Naulakha Pavilion is {{an iconic}} <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lahore Fort built in 1633 during the Shah Jahan period {{that is made}} of {{prominent}} white marble, and known for its distinctive curvilinear roof.

5|$|The {{engine and}} {{propeller}} had automatic controls, and an auto-trimmer made the aircraft tail-heavy as the pilot rolled over into his dive, lining up red lines at 60°, 75° or 80° on the cockpit side window with {{the horizon and}} aiming at the target with the <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fixed gun.

5|$|The {{military}} {{failure in}} the First Bishops' War caused a financial and diplomatic crisis for Charles that deepened when his efforts to raise funds from Spain, while simultaneously continuing his support for his Palatine relatives, led to the public humiliation of the Battle of the Downs, where the Dutch destroyed a Spanish bullion fleet {{off the coast of}} Kent in <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impotent English navy.|$|E

5|$|After renunciation, Tulsidas {{spent most}} of his time at Varanasi, Prayag, Ayodhya, and Chitrakuta but visited many other nearby and far-off places. He {{travelled}} across India to many places, studying different people, meeting saints and Sadhus and meditating. The Mula Gosain Charita gives an account of his travels to the four pilgrimages of Hindus (Badrinath, Dwarka, Puri and Rameshwaram) and the Himalayas.

5|$|Before leaving, Shackleton {{instructed}} Frank Wild {{that he was}} {{to assume}} full command as soon as the James Caird departed, and that should the journey fail, he was to attempt to take the party to Deception Island the following spring. The James Caird was launched from Elephant Island on 24 April 1916. The wind was a moderate south-westerly, which aided a swift getaway, and the boat was quickly out of <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> land.|$|E
5|$|Each act of {{the opera}} deals with a single element of the story, and each ends with a chorus. Despite the five-act structure, with two sets of scene changes, {{it is likely that}} L'Orfeo {{conformed}} to the standard practice for court entertainments of that time and was played as a continuous entity, without intervals or curtain descents between acts. It was the contemporary custom for scene shifts to take place in <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> audience, these changes being reflected musically by changes in instrumentation, key and style.|$|E

Riddler challenges also feature objectives requiring the Batmobile, such as timed races in tunnels beneath Gotham City, where the environmental obstacles change during each lap, and invisible question marks that must be revealed using the Batmobile's scanner.|$|E

5|$|On 2 February 1971 North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces {{launched}} their dry season offensive (Campaign 74B) {{to recapture the}} Plain of Jars. PAVN forces {{taking part in the}} operation included the 316th Division, the 165th Regiment of the 312th Division, the 866th Infantry Regiment, and three sapper battalions (the 13th, 27th, and 41st). Communist forces rolled west and southwest, securing territory in anticipation of a possible cease-fire. By February they had occupied the entire Plain of Jars, Long Tieng had been surrounded, and, {{for the first time since}} 1962, Pathet Lao forces were camped within <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royal capital of Luang Prabang.|$|E
5|$|On September 15, Howe landed {{his army}} in an amphibious {{operation}} at Kip's Bay, {{on the eastern}} shore of Manhattan, along the East River. After a bombardment of the American positions on the shore, 4,000 British and Hessian troops landed, and they fought the Battle of Kip's Bay. The American troops began to flee at the <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemy, and even after Washington arrived on the scene and took immediate command, demanding that his soldiers fight, they refused to obey orders and continued to flee.|$|E
5|$|On the {{northern}} end of the battlefield, events had unfolded quite differently. Dampierre's cavalry routed Lannoy's company of light horse; the Italians and the contingent from Gruyères, meanwhile, broke and fled—leaving their officers to be killed—without offering any real resistance to the advancing Imperial infantry. As Cardona's infantry moved past the original French line, Enghien descended on it with the entire body of heavy cavalry under his command; the subsequent engagement took place on the reverse slope of the ridge, out of <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest of the battlefield.|$|E

5|$|Over France, {{the losses}} became quite severe, {{particularly}} over {{the port of}} Brest, France. German defences were strong, owing to Operation Cerberus and Operation Donnerkeil, a joint Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe plan to enable the escape of Gneisenau, Scharnhorst and Prinz Eugen through the English Channel. Five Spitfires and a Mosquito were lost on PR operations in December 1941. The failure to photograph and pin-point {{the location of the}} ships, led to their successful move to Germany in February 1942. It was not until the day of the German operation that a Coastal Command aircraft caught <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ships, and by then it was too late.|$|E
5|$|Raucher's novelization of his {{screenplay}} of {{the same}} name was released prior to the film's release and became a runaway bestseller, to the point that audiences lost <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fact that the book was based on the film and not vice versa. Though a pop culture phenomenon {{in the first half of}} the 1970s, the novelization went out of print and slipped into obscurity throughout the next two decades until a Broadway adaptation in 2001 brought it back into the public light and prompted Barnes & Noble to acquire the publishing rights to the book.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt's {{death was}} met with shock and grief across the U.S. and around the world. His declining health had not been known to the general public.
