Constance, {{for the most part}} sitting solitary at home, trying in vain to write something that would meet the views of some editor. Merton, busy running about, full to overflowing of all the things he intended doing. Eden, doing nothing: only thinking, which, in his case at all events, was [...] "but an idle waste of thought." [...] So inactive was he at this period, and so much tobacco did he consume to assist his mental processes, that he grew languid and pale. His friends remarked that he was looking seedy. This made him angry--very angry for so slight a cause; and he thought that of all the intolerable things that have to be put up with this was the worst--that people should remark to a man that he is looking seedy, when the <b>seediness</b> is in the soul, and the cause of it a secret of which he is ashamed.|$|E

I have more than that, and find myself quite straitened to keep myself looking well.

I don't see where the fault is. Can one individual resist the whole current of society? It certainly is not strictly necessary for us girls to have half the things we do. We might, I suppose, live without many of them, and, as mamma says, look just as well, because girls did so before these things were invented. Now I confess I flatter myself, generally, that I am a pattern of good management and economy, because I get so much less than other girls I associate with. I wish you could see Miss Thorne's fall dresses that she showed me last year when she was visiting here. She had six gowns, and no one of them could have cost less than seventy or eighty dollars, and some of them must have been even more expensive, and yet I don't doubt that this fall she will feel that she must have just as many more. She runs through and wears out these expensive things, with all their velvet and thread lace, just as I wear my commonest ones; {{and at the end of}} the season they are really gone,--spotted, stained, frayed, the lace all pulled to pieces,--nothing left to save or make over. I feel as if Jenny and I were patterns of economy when I see such things. I really don't know what economy is. What is it?" ...|$|E

Appearance, flavor, and texture attributes of blackberry fruits are important to consumers. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate correlations among sensory and composition attributes of blackberry genotypes from the University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture breeding program. Descriptive panelists evaluated attributes of 20 blackberry genotypes. Composition attributes were evaluated for these and two additional genotypes. ‘Natchez’ had the most pyrenes/berry and the highest levels of total ellagitannins. Selection A- 2215 was scored highest for descriptive-evaluated sweetness and had the highest soluble solids content. Total ellagitannins (r= 0. 57; p 3 ̆c 0. 0095) and ORAC (r= 0. 54; p 3 ̆c 0. 0146) were moderately correlated to <b>seediness,</b> which may reflect the value of ORAC factors in pyrenes. These initial investigations of the relationship between sensory and composition of blackberry genotypes provide insights that can be used for future blackberry cultivar assessments...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} pollen source on fruit set and fruit quality {{characteristics}} (xenia effects) {{were examined in}} three commercial cultivars of mandarin, Imperial, Ellenor, and Murcott. Six trees of each cultivar received six pollination treatments: three cross-pollen sources, self-pollination, bagging and bagging with emasculation. Pollen tube growth, percentage fruit set, fruit weight, <b>seediness,</b> sugar and acid content were assessed in all treatments. Significant xenia effects, including effects on sugar content, were found in all cultivars. 'Imperial' {{was found to be}} self-incompatible as self-pollen tubes were inhibited in the upper style. This resulted in a lower fruit set in self-pollinated fruits (P less than 0. 01), a very low fruit weight (33 - 55 g, compared with 92 - 103 g, P less than 0. 01), and fruits containing few or no seeds. In addition, 'Ellenor' and 'Murcott' pollen significantly increased sugar content of fruit by between 0. 9 - 1. 6 % compared with self-pollinated and unpollinated treatments (P less than 0. 05). Widespread problems of variable production and poor fruit quality in 'Imperial' may be alleviated by interplanting with appropriate pollen sources such as 'Ellenor' and 'Murcott'. Pollen source significantly affected fruit set, seed number and sugar content but not fruit weight of cv. Ellenor. In particular, 'Murcott' pollen produced a significantly higher fruit set, relatively low seed number, and the highest mean sugar content (13. 2 %), significantly higher than 'Imperial' pollen, bagged, and unpollinated treatments (greater than 12. 5 %, P less than 0. 01). Fruit production, <b>seediness</b> and sugar content of 'Ellenor' mandarin may be improved by interplanting with 'Murcott'. Cross-pollination significantly increased seed number of 'Murcott' (15 - 21 seeds per fruit, compared with 13 - 17 seeds per fruit, P less than 0. 01). 'Murcott' could be planted in pure blocks since self-pollinated 'Murcott' fruit had slightly fewer seeds than crosses, without any significant loss of size or quality. These results demonstrate the need for careful consideration of interplanting of cultivars and management of pollinators such as the honeybee, Apis mellifera L. to maximize fruit production and quality in mandarins...|$|E

Developing Berberis hispanica Boiss & Reuter berries are heavily attacked by a single species of fly larvae which feed on seed contents. There is a steady increase in fruit attack incidence with increasing number of seeds in the fruit, and individual developing seeds have a greater average probability of escaping predation when single in fruits (0. 688) than when two (0. 379) or more (0. 120) are {{together in the same}} berry. With increasing fruit <b>seediness,</b> larval food increases and larval mortality decreases. Differential predation on differently-seeded fruits apparently results from higher larval survival in multi-seed fruits, which in turn has selected for differential oviposition among fruit classes by female flies. The proportions of differently-seeded fruits are linearly correlated with the estimated number of surviving seeds per mass unit of pulp expenditure, suggesting that B. hispanica plants are probably adjusting the distribution of seeds among fruit classes to maximize absolute number of surviv...|$|E
40|$|Presence of a {{large number}} of seed {{contents}} in citrus fruits is a big restraint in consumer’s acceptability even if the fruit have premium organoleptic characteristics. Consumers are only willing to eat seeded fruits if seedless are not available. <b>Seediness</b> is also a major handicap restricting the use of large number of fruit in processing industries and increases the cost of juice or pulp production. Moreover, seed presence in the fruit may be related with bitterness and certain undesirable aromatic compounds. Various useful breeding approaches have been devised by researchers to reduce total number of seeds or create complete seedlessness in citrus fruits. These consist of both orthodox and modern molecular breeding tools. Conventional techniques used in the past encountered numerous problems due to specific reproductive physiology of citrus and was also time exhaustive. Modern molecular techniques like embryo rescue, protoplast fusion, cybrids, irradiation, inter specific or generic crosses, flow cytometry and citrus transformation are less time consuming and more productive as well as rapid results can be attained in short time period. Molecular techniques have further reduced the difficulties faced in conventional breeding to produce less seeded or completely seedless citrus cultivars...|$|E
