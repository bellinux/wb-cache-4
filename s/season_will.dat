In the 2009–10 season the top four teams advanced to the playoffs and play two best-of-five rounds. The league scheduled {{the end of the}} regular season and postseason around the Olympic break.

5|$|Greys Anatomy {{follows the}} lives of {{surgical}} interns and residents at the fictional Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital (formerly Seattle Grace Hospital, Season 1–6, Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, Season 6–9, and then Grey-Sloan Memorial Hospital, Season 9–present), as they gradually evolve into seasoned doctors, {{with the help of}} their competent mentors. Every installment, typically, commences with a voice-over narrative from Meredith Grey or a season regular, foreshadowing the theme of the episode. Each season tends to represent the physicians' academic year, with each completed year qualifying the residents at a level higher in the surgical field. The <b>season</b> <b>will</b> always end with a finale, typically involving a tragic event such as a death or character departure. Most installments revolve around the doctors' everyday lives as surgeons, but the show puts an emphasis on their personal, rather than professional, lives. The series sets aside medical ethic concerns to focus on character development and relationships. Although the physicians treat the illnesses of their patients, often through complex surgeries, their primary motivation is customarily praise and competition.|$|E
5|$|Intended to be Galveston follow-up, Pizzolatto felt True Detective {{was more}} {{suitable}} on-screen once the project took definite form. Pizzolatto shopped the novel to two TV executives, and, once he secured {{a deal in}} May 2010, drafted six screenplays, including the pilot episode script for True Detective, which ran 90 pages. He devoted another script for the series shortly after his departure from The Killings writing staff in 2011, thanks to the support of Anonymous Content. The final copy, amounting to 500 pages, was written {{without the aid of}} a writing staff. By this time, Pizzolatto secured a development deal with HBO, and by April 2012, the network commissioned True Detective on an order of eight episodes. Set up as an anthology series, each <b>season</b> <b>will</b> feature a different cast of characters and self-contained narratives in various time periods and locations.|$|E

5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-winged fairywren {{is notable}} for its marked sexual dimorphism, males {{adopting}} a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue and chestnut contrasting {{with black and}} grey-brown. The brightly coloured crown, ear tufts and upper back are prominently featured in breeding displays. The male in breeding plumage has a silvery blue crown, ear coverts and upper back, a black throat and nape, bright red-brown shoulders, a long grey-brown tail and wings, and greyish-white belly. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour, though males may retain traces of blue and black plumage. All males have a black bill and lores (eye-ring and bare skin between eyes and bill), while females have a black bill, rufous lores and pale grey eye-ring. Immature males will develop black lores by six weeks of age and generally moult into an incomplete breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching. This has a patchy or spotty appearance, {{with a mixture of}} blue and grey feathers on the head, and black and grey on the breast; birds born early in the breeding <b>season</b> <b>will</b> gain more nuptial plumage initially than those born late. Most perfect their nuptial moult by their second spring, though some may need another year. Several males have been observed in breeding plumage in a single group at the same time, although it is unknown if or how this is related to dominance or breeding status.|$|E
5|$|The {{mating season}} lasts from August to February, and {{coincides with the}} arrival of the rainy season in {{northern}} Australia. The female does the bulk of the nest building, although the male does assist; this is unusual for the genus Malurus. Concealed in grass tussocks or low shrubs, the spherical nest is constructed of dried grasses and usually lined with smaller, finer grasses and hair. Nests examined in southeast Queensland tended to be larger and untidier than those in northern Australia; the former measured 1215cm high by 912cm wide and bore a partly covered 36cm diameter entrance, whereas the latter average around 1013cm in height by 68cm wide with a 24cm entrance. Construction takes around one week, and there may be an interval of up to another seven days before eggs are laid. The eggs produced are white with reddish-brown spots in clutches of three to four, and measure 14.517 x 1013mm; those of subspecies melanocephalus are a little larger than those of cruentatus. The eggs are incubated for two weeks by the female alone. The nestlings are hidden under cover for one week after hatching. The juveniles depend on parents and helpers for approximately one month. They learn to fly between 1112days after hatching. Broods hatched earlier in the <b>season</b> <b>will</b> help to raise the broods hatched later on. They will stay as a clutch group for the season after hatching.|$|E
