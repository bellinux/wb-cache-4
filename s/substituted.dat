5000|$|People {{exhibit a}} strong {{preference}} for within-category <b>substitutes</b> to cross-category <b>substitutes.</b> Across a ten sets of different foods, {{a majority of}} research participants (79.7%) believed that a within-category <b>substitute</b> would better satisfy their craving for a food {{they could not have}} than a cross-category <b>substitute.</b> Unable to acquire a desired Godiva chocolate, for instance, a majority reported that they would prefer to eat a store-brand chocolate (a within-category <b>substitute)</b> than a chocolate-chip granola bar (a cross-category <b>substitute).</b> This preference for within-category <b>substitutes</b> appears, however, to be misguided. Because within-category <b>substitutes</b> are more similar to the missing good, their inferiority to it is more noticeable. This creates a negative contrast effect, and leads within-category <b>substitutes</b> to be less satisfying <b>substitutes</b> than cross-category <b>substitutes.</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} 3 types of polymer-based saliva <b>substitutes</b> in reducing oral dryness in patients with Sjogren's syndrome (SS). Methods. Subjective efficacy of 3 different saliva <b>substitutes</b> (determined by self-administered questionnaire) was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 43 patients with primary and secondary SS. High-viscosity versus low-viscosity xanthan gum-based saliva <b>substitutes</b> were also compared in 33 SS patients, Salivary flow rates (SFR) were determined to examine correlations between the SFR and the subjective efficacy of the saliva <b>substitute.</b> Results. Neither the saliva <b>substitutes</b> nor the placebo was truly effective. Preference for a particular saliva <b>substitute</b> over placebo was equally distributed among the 3 types of <b>substitutes.</b> The SFR of patients who preferred polyacrylic acid-based saliva <b>substitutes</b> was lower than that in patients who preferred the porcine mucin-based <b>substitute</b> (P < 0. 05). Patients whose oral dryness was reduced by low-viscoelastic <b>substitutes</b> had a low stimulated SFR (< 0. 20 ml/minute; P < 0. 05). Conclusion. The optimal properties of a saliva <b>substitute</b> {{are not the same}} for all patients with SS, but are dependent on such parameters as the individual SFR. Thus, to {{determine the}} best saliva <b>substitute</b> for a particular patient, it is necessary to have the patient try a number of <b>substitutes</b> of different viscoelastic properties...|$|R

5|$|Owing {{to their}} {{stability}} and relative ease of preparation, rhodocenium salts are the usual starting material for preparing rhodocene and <b>substituted</b> rhodocenes, {{all of which}} are unstable. The original synthesis used a cyclopentadienyl anion and tris(acetylacetonato)rhodium(III); numerous other approaches have since been reported, including gas-phase redox transmetalation and using half-sandwich precursors. Octaphenylrhodocene (a derivative with eight phenyl groups attached) was the first <b>substituted</b> rhodocene to be isolated at room temperature, though it decomposes rapidly in air. X-ray crystallography confirmed that octaphenylrhodocene has a sandwich structure with a staggered conformation. Unlike cobaltocene, which has become a useful one-electron reducing agent in research, no rhodocene derivative yet discovered is stable enough for such applications.|$|E

5|$|The {{differences}} in reduction potentials is attributed in the cobaltocenium {{system to the}} inductive effect of the alkyl groups, further stabilising the 18-valence electron species. A similar effect {{is seen in the}} rhodocenium data shown above, again consistent with inductive effects. In the <b>substituted</b> iridocenium system, cyclic voltammetry investigations shows irreversible reductions at temperatures as low as −60°C; by comparison, the reduction of the corresponding rhodocenes is quasi-reversible at room temperature and fully reversible at −35°C. The irreversibility of the <b>substituted</b> iridocenium reductions is attributed to the extremely rapid dimerisation of the resulting 19-valence electron species, which further illustrates that iridocenes are less stable than their corresponding rhodocenes.|$|E
