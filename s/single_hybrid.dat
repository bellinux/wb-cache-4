60|$|During the {{numerous}} experiments {{that have been}} made on the hybridisation of plants similar peculiarities have been noticed, some individuals being capable, others incapable, of being crossed with a distinct species. The same individual peculiarities are found in varieties, species, and genera. Kölreuter crossed five varieties of the common tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) with a distinct species, Nicotiana glutinosa, and they all yielded very sterile hybrids; but those raised from one variety were less sterile, in all the experiments, than the hybrids from the four other varieties. Again, most of the species of the genus Nicotiana have been crossed, and freely produce hybrids; but one species, N. acuminata, not particularly distinct from the others, could neither fertilise, nor be fertilised by, any of the eight other species experimented on. Among genera we find some--such as Hippeastrum, Crinum, Calceolaria, Dianthus--almost all the species of which will fertilise other species and produce hybrid offspring; while other allied genera, as Zephyranthes and Silene, notwithstanding the most persevering efforts, have not produced a <b>single</b> <b>hybrid</b> even between the most closely allied species.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to compare the health and physiological quality of double crosses-maize hybrid seeds obtained from F 1 and F 2 generations of <b>single</b> crosses <b>hybrids.</b> Field trials were carried out at the Federal University of Lavras – UFLA in two sowing dates, September and December 2001. Four isolated plots were used in each sowing date to produce seeds of the double hybrids DKB 333 /AG 9012 and DKB 901 /AG 9012. In two plots the female parental consisted of the F 1 generations of the <b>single</b> <b>hybrids</b> DKB 333 e DKB 901 and the male parental was the <b>single</b> cross <b>hybrid</b> AG 9012. On the other two plots, the female parental consisted of F 2 generations of the <b>single</b> crosses <b>hybrids</b> DKB 333 e DKB 901. The following agronomic characteristics were measured: plant height, ear insertion, ear weight and seed production. Seeds, size 22, were used to evaluate: germination, cold test, artificial aging, speed of emergence, emergence in substract of soil and sand mixture, seedling dry weight matter and health analysis by the blotter test. The experimental design was completely randomized using a factorial with two hybrids, two generations (F 1 and F 2), two sowing dates and four replications. The results showed a 28. 7 % decrease in seed production when the female parental came from the F 2 generation instead of the F 1 generation. For both hybrids, DKB 901 /AG 9012 and DKB 333 /AG 9012 sowed in September, the decrease in seed production was around 46 % for the plants originated from F 2 generation when compared to those from F 1 generation.

6000|$|Independently of the {{appearance}} of new characters from crossing, a few words may be added {{to what has been}} said in former chapters on the unequal combination and transmission of the characters proper to the two parent-forms. When two species or races are crossed, the offspring of the first generation are generally uniform, but those subsequently produced display an almost infinite diversity of character. He who wishes, says Kolreuter (22/41. 'Nova Acta, St. Petersburg' 1794 page 391.), to obtain an endless number of varieties from hybrids should cross and recross them. There is also much variability when hybrids or mongrels are reduced or absorbed by repeated crosses with either pure parent-form: and a still higher degree of variability when three distinct species, and most of all when four species, are blended together by successive crosses. Beyond this point Gartner (22/42. 'Bastarderzeugung' s. 507, 516, 572.), on whose authority the foregoing statements are made, never succeeded in effecting a union; but Max Wichura (22/43. 'Die Bastardbefruchtung' etc. 1865 s. 24.) united six distinct species of willows into a <b>single</b> <b>hybrid.</b> The sex of the parent species affects in an inexplicable manner the degree of variability of hybrids; for Gartner (22/44. 'Bastarderzeugung' s. 452, 507.) repeatedly found that when a hybrid was used as a father and either one of the pure parent-species, or a third species, was used as the mother, the offspring were more variable than when the same hybrid was used as the mother, and either pure parent or the same third species as the father: thus seedlings from Dianthus barbatus crossed by the hybrid D. chinensi-barbatus were more variable than those raised from this latter hybrid fertilised by the pure D. barbatus. Max Wichura (22/45. 'Die Bastardbefruchtung' s. 56.) insists strongly on an analogous result with his hybrid willows. Again Gartner (22/46. 'Bastarderzeugung' s. 423.) asserts that the degree of variability sometimes differs in hybrids raised from reciprocal crosses between the same two species; and here the sole difference is, that the one species is first used as the father and then as the mother. On the whole we see that, independently of {{the appearance}} of new characters, the variability of successive crossed generations is extremely complex, partly from the offspring partaking unequally of the characters of the two parent- forms, and more especially from their unequal tendency to revert to such characters or to those of more ancient progenitors.] ...|$|E

40|$|A {{review study}} on maize hybrid and inbred line {{productivity}} and stability, {{in an effort}} to overcome stagnation by developing more efficient breeding strategies. Data presented here, refer to maize hybrid and inbred line yields, under high and low plant populations, which depict the need for incorporation of favourable additive gene action in the genetic materials, under pedigree line selection schemes evaluating per se performance. Additionally, low populations during the first stages of selection, contribute to more reliable evaluation of favourable genotypes. Data reveal that inbred lines are capable to reach hybrid performance and consequently, replace <b>single</b> <b>hybrids</b> as the end-products for farmer use. As far as the yielding capacity of inbred parents improves, the less the yield in F 1 is favored by heterozygosity. Other products, such as three-way crosses with lower level of heterozygosity, may be more efficient and stable than <b>single</b> <b>hybrids</b> and more readily developed. These products depend their productivity on additive gene action. Stability and uniformity of performance of three-way crosses is depended on high and stable inbred line performance.
