This new web <b>standard</b> <b>changes</b> the way that users are affected by the internet and their privacy on the internet. HTML5 expands the number of methods given to a website to store information locally on a client as well as the amount of data that can be stored. As such, privacy risks are increased. For instance, merely erasing cookies {{may not be enough to}} remove potential tracking methods since data could be mirrored in web storage, another means of keeping information in a user's web browser. There are so many sources of data storage that it is challenging for web browsers to present sensible privacy settings. As the power of web standards increases, so do potential misuses.|$|E
500|$|While Lavigne denied being angry, her {{interviews}} were still {{passionate about the}} media's {{lack of respect for}} her songwriting. She said [...] "I am a writer, and I won't accept people trying to take that away from me", adding that she had been writing [...] "full-structured songs" [...] since she was 14. Despite this, Lavigne's songwriting has been questioned throughout her career. The songwriting trio the Matrix, with whom Lavigne wrote songs for her debut album, claimed that they were the main songwriters of Lavigne's singles [...] "Complicated", [...] "Sk8er Boi" [...] and [...] "I'm with You". Lavigne denied this, asserting that she was the primary songwriter for every song on the album, saying that [...] "one of those songs aren't from me". In 2007, Chantal Kreviazuk, who wrote with Lavigne on her second album, accused Lavigne of plagiarism and criticized her songwriting, saying that [...] "Avril doesn't really sit and write songs by herself or anything." [...] Lavigne also disclaimed this, and considered taking legal action against Kreviazuk for [...] "clear defamation" [...] against her character. Kreviazuk later apologized, saying that [...] "Avril is an accomplished songwriter and it has been my privilege to work with her." [...] Shortly after that, Tommy Dunbar, founder of the band the Rubinoos, sued Lavigne, her publishing company, and Lukasz [...] "Dr. Luke" [...] Gottwald for allegedly stealing parts of [...] "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend" [...] for her song [...] "Girlfriend". Gottwald defended Lavigne, stating, [...] "me and Avril wrote the song together... It has the same chord progressions as ten different Blink-182 songs, the <b>standard</b> <b>changes</b> you'd find in a Sum 41 song. It's the Sex Pistols, not the Rubinoos." [...] In January 2008, the lawsuit was closed after a confidential settlement had been reached.|$|E

He also expressed concern about how standards would be interpreted in the show ring. While some breeders have shown {{their support for the}} new standards, others are upset with the new standards and have threatened legal actions against the Kennel Club. The Chairman of the British Bulldog Breed Council said of the new Bulldog standard: [...] "What you'll get is a completely different dog, not a British bulldog.

6000|$|Akin {{to these}} is the false theory of progress, which {{maintains}} that we alter the test {{instead of trying to}} pass the test. We often hear it said, for instance, [...] "What is right in one age is wrong in another." [...] This is quite reasonable, if it means that there is a fixed aim, and that certain methods attain at certain times and not at other times. If women, say, desire to be elegant, it may be that they are improved at one time by growing fatter and at another time by growing thinner. But you cannot say that they are improved by ceasing to wish to be elegant and beginning to wish to be oblong. If the <b>standard</b> <b>changes,</b> how can there be improvement, which implies a standard? Nietzsche started a nonsensical idea that men had once sought as good what we now call evil; if it were so, we could not talk of surpassing or even falling short of them. How can you overtake Jones if you walk in the other direction? You cannot discuss whether one people has succeeded more in being miserable than another succeeded in being happy. It would be like discussing whether Milton was more puritanical than a pig is fat.|$|E

50|$|The actual total {{stopping}} distance may differ from the baseline value when the road or tire conditions are substantially different from the baseline conditions or when the driver's cognitive function is superior or deficient. To determine actual total {{stopping distance}}, one would typically empirically obtain the coefficient of friction between the tire material and the exact road spot under the same road conditions and temperature. They would also measure the person's perception and reaction times. A driver who has innate reflexes, and thus braking distances, that are far below the safety margins provided in the road design or expected by other users, may not be safe to drive. Most old roads were not engineered with the deficient driver in mind, and often used a defunct 3/4 second reaction time standard. There have been recent road <b>standard</b> <b>changes</b> to make modern roadways more accessible to an increasingly aging population of drivers.|$|E
