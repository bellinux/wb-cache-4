In 1998 the post was moved to the Centre for the Historic Environment within the Department of Archaeology. He would subsequently be instrumental in setting up the master's degree in archaeology and <b>screen</b> <b>media</b> at the department. By 1996, Aston was feeling [...] "a bit frustrated" [...] with Time Team, primarily because he was always [...] "number two" [...] to Robinson. He proceeded to present his own [...] six-episode series, Time Traveller, in which he explored various archaeological sites in the counties around Bristol. It was broadcast on HTV over July and August 1997, and gained the largest local audiences for its time slot.|$|E

Large {{producers}} such as mines or huge quarries {{use them to}} reduce the frequency of having to stop the plant for screen deck maintenance. Rubber is also used as a very resistant high-impact <b>screen</b> <b>media</b> material used on the top deck of a scalper screen. To compete with rubber <b>screen</b> <b>media</b> fabrication, polyurethane manufacturers developed <b>screen</b> <b>media</b> with lower Shore Hardness. To compete with self-cleaning <b>screen</b> <b>media</b> that is still primarily available in tensioned cloth, synthetic <b>screen</b> <b>media</b> manufacturers also developed membrane screen panels, slotted opening panels and diamond opening panels.
