25|$|PAC, {{with its}} {{operational}} headquarters in Iquitos, dominated {{the city and}} the region. The area was separated from the main population of Peru by the Andes, and it was 1900 miles from the Amazon's mouth at Pará. The British-registered company was effectively controlled by the archetypal rubber baron Julio Cesar Arana and his brother. Born in Lima, Arana had climbed out of poverty to own and operate a company harvesting great quantities of rubber in the Peruvian Amazon, which was much in demand on the world market. The rubber boom had led to expansion in Iquitos as a trading center, as all the company rubber was shipped down the Amazon River from there to the Atlantic port. Numerous foreigners had flocked to the area seeking their fortunes in the rubber boom, or at least <b>some</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> the business. The rough frontier city, both respectable businesses and the vice district, was highly dependent on the PAC.|$|E
500|$|Nixon speechwriter William Safire {{had been}} told of the sign by a friend of Nixon, Richard Moore, who left the train at {{campaign}} stops to mingle with the crowd and seek items of local color for the speechwriters to use. Safire stated in his book on {{the early days of}} the Nixon administration (originally published in 1975) that at Deshler, [...] "Moore boarded the train with that mystic look that a writer gets when he has something delicious to work with, <b>some</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> color that could be more than a gimmick." [...] According to Safire in a 2007 column, Moore stuck his head into the compartment occupied by Nixon's speechwriters and stated, [...] "There's a little kid out there with a hand-lettered sign that I think says 'Bring Us Together'." [...] Safire wrote in that column that he inserted the phrase into Nixon's remarks for the speech to be given at the next stop.|$|E
500|$|Stanley Schmidt was an {{assistant}} professor of physics when he became editor of Analog, and his scientific background was well-suited to the magazine's readership. [...] He avoided making drastic changes, and continued the long-standing tradition of writing provocative editorials, though he rarely discussed science fiction. In 1979 he resurrected [...] "Probability Zero", a feature that Campbell had run in the early 1940s that published tall tales—humorous stories with ludicrous or impossible scientific premises. [...] Also in 1979 Schmidt began a series of columns titled [...] "The Alternate View", an opinion column that was written in alternate issues by G. Harry Stine and Jerry Pournelle, and which is still a feature of the magazine as of 2016, though now with different contributors. [...] The stable of fiction contributors remained largely unchanged from Bova's day, and included many names, such as Poul Anderson, Gordon R. Dickson, and George O. Smith, familiar to readers from the Campbell era. [...] This continuity led to criticisms within the field, Bruce Sterling writing in 1984 that the magazine [...] "has become old, dull, and drivelling... It is a situation screaming for reform. [...] Analog no longer permits itself to be read." [...] The magazine thrived nevertheless, and though part of the increase in circulation during the early 1980s may have been due to Davis Publications' energetic efforts to increase subscriptions, Schmidt knew what his readership wanted and made sure they got it, commenting in 1985: [...] "I reserve Analog for the kind of science fiction I've described here: good stories about people with problems in which <b>some</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> plausible (or at least not demonstrably implausible) speculative science plays an indispensable role".|$|E

He began welding in 1952, and these efforts are considered the first kinetic-junk assemblages. Hedrick made assemblages and sculptures from beer cans, lights, broken radio and television sets, refrigerators, and washing machines he found in junkyards. [...] "What interests me", he said later, is [...] "to take garbage and make it into art, kind of ironic art." [...] He painted over the surfaces with thick layers of impasto and gesso which incorporated the work into the aesthetic of action painting. He was particularly pleased when he could fix an abandoned appliance sufficiently that at least <b>some</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> it would work and he could turn his assemblages into moving sculptures.|$|E
