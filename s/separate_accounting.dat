The network on which traffic was allowed was to be extended to the whole European network. As a consequence of this new trans-national freight network an additional change was made to the original legislation which required train safety and operating standards to be set out clearly and administered by an organisation that did not run commercial services. The directive also required <b>separate</b> <b>accounting</b> of freight and passenger service revenues and costs.|$|E
2500|$|Part of Ebrington Barracks {{was handed}} over to the Royal Navy in mid-1941 and the entire barracks came under Admiralty command in 1943 as RN Barracks Ebrington, part of the Londonderry shore base known as HMS Ferret. [...] The old North of Ireland {{shipyard}} at Pennyburn was also taken over {{to be used as a}} ship repair facility, manned by workers from the Harland and Wolff yard at Belfast. Ships based at Ferret were under the operational control of Western Approaches Command, located in Plymouth for the early part of the war. [...] The main headquarters for the Western Approaches Command was moved to Liverpool in February 1941 as the North Western Approaches became the most vital area of convoy activity. [...] Ferret was then the backup for the Liverpool headquarters, with the other main bases in the area being at Greenock, and later at Belfast. The organisational function of Ferret was to form escort groups of the warships based there, mostly small destroyers, frigates, corvettes and armed trawlers. From 1 February 1941 these craft had a <b>separate</b> <b>accounting</b> system from the main base. [...] By 1942 this system had been extended to handle the accounts of Royal Navy ships based at St' John's and Argentia. [...] A Coastal Forces base was established in April 1941, under the name HMS Ferret II.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Separate</b> <b>accounts</b> in the U.S. {{markets are}} often {{characterized}} as either managed or non-managed. A managed <b>separate</b> <b>account</b> is synonymous to {{a mutual fund}} {{in the sense that}} the investments of the <b>separate</b> <b>account</b> are actively managed (such as stocks, bonds or other debt instruments, loans, derivative instruments, etc.). A non-managed <b>separate</b> <b>account</b> is one that invests more [...] "passively" [...] in that it typically owns shares of other managed pools of investments such as mutual fund shares. This is similar to a [...] "fund of funds" [...] whereby the <b>separate</b> <b>account</b> ("fund") simply invests in shares of one or more mutual funds. This arrangement is sometimes more efficient and cost-effective rather than the insurance company maintaining many <b>separate</b> <b>accounts</b> with similar baskets of securities.|$|R

50|$|Unified managed {{accounts}} are managed investment accounts {{that have developed}} out of <b>separate</b> <b>accounts.</b> Where a <b>separate</b> <b>account</b> holds the securities associated with a single investment manager or style managed for a client, a unified managed account typically holds multiple <b>separate</b> <b>accounts,</b> {{as well as other}} investment products such as mutual funds and exchange traded funds. Unified managed accounts also typically automate services such as rebalancing, cashflow management, and other services that are typically handled manually by financial advisors or institutions when using a <b>separate</b> <b>account.</b> A unified managed account removes the need to have more than one account and combines all of the assets into one account with a single registration.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>separate</b> <b>account</b> is a {{segregated}} accounting and reporting account held by {{an insurance company}} not in, but rather [...] "separate" [...] from its general <b>account.</b> A <b>separate</b> <b>account</b> allows an investor to choose an investment category according to his individual risk tolerance, and desire for performance.

5000|$|<b>Separate</b> <b>accounting,</b> {{with its}} {{emphasis}} on carving out of the overall business only income from sources within a single state, ignores the value attributable to the integrated nature of the business. Yet, to a large degree, the wealth, power, and profits of the world's large multinational enterprises are attributable to the very fact that they are integrated, unitary businesses. Hellerstein Treatise, P8.03 at 8-32.n9 As one commentator has explained: To believe that multinational corporations do not maintain an advantage over independent corporations operating within a similar business sphere is to ignore the economic and political strength of the multinational giants. By attempting to treat those businesses which are in fact unitary as independent entities, <b>separate</b> <b>accounting</b> [...] "operates in a universe of pretense; as in Alice in Wonderland, it turns reality into fancy and then pretends it is the real world" ...|$|E

50|$|In principle, {{the profit}} tax becomes {{a tax on}} the factors {{included}} into the formula, i.e., capital, sales and labour. This means that the tax bill increases {{in the country where}} one of the factors rises. Thus, tax planning is still possible as companies have an incentive to shift the tax base to low-tax jurisdictions by means of transferring the formula factors, e.g., capital (i.e., assets) could be transferred from Germany to the Slovak Republic. However, tax planning under <b>separate</b> <b>accounting</b> focuses on tax base shifting whereas tax planning under formula apportionment focuses on the location of investments.|$|E
