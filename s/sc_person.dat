50|$|After each Autumn move, newly {{acquired}} supply centers become {{owned by the}} occupying player, and each power's supply center total is recalculated; players with fewer supply centers than units on the board must disband units, while players with more supply centers than units on the board are entitled to build units in their Home centers (supply centers controlled {{at the start of}} the game). Players controlling no supply centers are eliminated from the game, and if a player controls 18 or more (that is, more than half) of the 34 <b>SCs,</b> that <b>person</b> is declared the winner. Players may also agree to a draw; this also happens when (infrequent) stalemates occur.|$|R
40|$|The need of organising a {{comparison}} of laboratory standard microphones type LS 2 aP was agreed during the EUROMET TC AUV “Sound in air” <b>SC</b> and contact <b>persons</b> meeting in Warsaw, held in May 2002. The goal of the comparison is to complement on a regional scale the CIPM CCAUV. A-K 3 comparison, {{in order to be}} able to demonstrate the equivalence of acoustical pressure standards of European NMIs [...] EUROMET TC AUV presented a project N° 674 for the comparison and it was agreed that IEN would be the pilot laboratory. The link to the CCAUV key comparison was realized by the use of BLUE (Best Linear Unbiased Estimator) for the first time in the acoustic metrology field, and the drift of one of the two standards used was taken into account following two different approaches...|$|R
40|$|Using {{two rounds}} of nationally {{representative}} surveys on household wealth conducted in India during 1991 - 1992 and 2002 - 2003, we analyze the relationship between overall wealth inequality and caste divisions in India. The average minority (<b>SC</b> or ST) <b>person</b> in India had a substantial disadvantage in wealth relative to the average non-minority person. In the non-minority group, the forward caste Hindus was the clear leaders in both the rural and the urban areas. The Other Backward Classes (OBC) and Non-Hindus occupied positions that placed them noticeably above the minorities, but, significantly below the forward caste Hindus. Using the ANOGi decomposition technique, we estimate that between-caste inequality accounts {{for as much as}} 13 percent of overall wealth inequality. The stratification parameters resulting from the procedure indicate that the forward caste Hindus had a wealth distribution that had a fairly low degree of overlap with the other caste groups, while the other caste groups had significantly higher degrees of overlap with each other and the overall population. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{contribute}} to the literature on village governance and local public goods provision. Using data from 144 village-level governments in India's Tamil Nadu state, we examine whether the gender and caste of village government leaders influence village public goods provision. In particular, we examine: 1) whether public goods are provided in accordance with gender or caste preferences; and 2) whether public goods provision differs based on the knowledge level of the village government leader. We find evidence of different preferences for public goods between men and women, and between Scheduled Caste (<b>SC)</b> and non-SC <b>persons.</b> Additionally, a test of knowledge regarding the village government reveals that female and SC presidents receive lower scores relative to male and non-SC presidents, with women scoring lowest overall. We find that preferences and knowledge have little effect on public goods provision by female presidents, and hypothesize that {{this may be due to}} the influence of their male spouses. In the context of SC presidents, we find evidence that SC presidents provide more drinking water access-a location-specific public good-to SC-inhabited village areas.

40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} Cloud Computing (CC) {{has been}} commercially popular for shared resources of third party applications. A cloud platform enables to share resources among mutually distrusting CC clients and offers cost-effective, on-demand scaling. With the exponential growth of CC environment, vulnerabilities and their corresponding {{exploitation of the}} prevailing cloud resources may potentially increase. Although CC provides numerous benefits to the cloud computing tenant. However, features namely resource sharing and Virtual Machine (VM) physical co-residency raising the potential for sensitive information leakages such as Side Channel (SC) attacks. In particular, the physical co-residency feature allows attackers to communicate with another VM on the same physical machine and leak the confidential information due to inadequate logical isolation. Unlike encryption, which protects information from being decoded by unauthorized <b>persons,</b> <b>SC</b> attacks aim to exploit the encryption systems and to hide the occurrence of communication. SC attacks were initially identified as the main threat on multi-level secure systems i. e. OS, database, and networks. More recently, {{the focus of the}} researchers has shifted toward SC attacks in CC. Since the last level cache (L 2 or L 3) is always shared between VM, is the most targeting device for these attacks. Therefore, the aim {{of this article is to}} explore cross-VM SC attacks involving the CPU cache and their countermeasures in CC and to compare with the traditional SC attacks and countermeasures. We categorized the SC attacks according to the hardware medium they target and exploit, the ways they access the module and the method they use to extract confidential information. We identified that traditional prevention mechanisms for SC attacks are not appropriate for prevention of cross-VM cache-based SC attacks. We also proposed countermeasures for the prevention of these attacks in order to improve security in CC...|$|R
