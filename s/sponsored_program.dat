2500|$|For {{one season}} in the early 1940s, a {{high-profile}} <b>sponsored</b> <b>program</b> on the Blue was The Cavalcade of America, a show dramatizing historical events which was sponsored by DuPont. [...] The show, which debuted in 1935 on CBS {{and moved to the}} Blue in January 1940, was created {{at a time when the}} firm was under attack for being, in effect, a [...] "merchant of death", and this show, which focused on American historical figures, was one way DuPont tried to burnish its image. [...] Certainly, the show had high production values, as can be witnessed by its use of Raymond Massey for a show in February 1940 on Abraham Lincoln, as described in the February 26, 1940 issue of Time. [...] It was also known for the use of university professors to vet the historical accuracy of the stories, as well as scripts by future Pulitzer Prize-winner Arthur Miller. [...] (This show would eventually stay with NBC Red and NBC, starting in 1941, and the network would continue to broadcast the show even into the age of television).|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis examines on e {{way in which}} the U. S. Coast Guard can help facilitate the transition of personnel being transferred on PCS moves. Specifically, it focuses on the <b>Sponsor</b> <b>Program</b> and the anticipatory socialization of the member being transferred. A description of each of the other military services' Sponsor/Indoctrination Programs in included, {{as well as some of}} the relocation programs used in the civilian community. The results from a survey of a sample of Coast Guard units provide information on the reactions and feelings of Coast Guard personnel towards the <b>Sponsor</b> <b>Program,</b> and provide empirical support for theoretical propositions about links between the <b>Sponsor</b> <b>Program,</b> transition smoothness and job satisfaction. In the concluding chapter, the author makes recommendations for how the Coast Guard can improve the <b>Sponsor</b> <b>Program</b> and potentially increase both job satisfaction and retention of personnel in the Coast Guard.
