5|$|On 8 April 2009, former Prime Minister Geir H. Haarde {{stated that}} he was <b>solely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> {{accepting}} controversial donations to the Icelandic Independence Party in 2006, ISK 30 million from the investment group FL Group, and ISK 25 million from Landsbanki.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, Sarawak, {{together}} with neighbouring North Borneo, and Brunei, became British protectorates, {{and the responsibility}} for foreign policy was {{handed over to the}} British in exchange for military protection. Since the formation of Malaysia, the Malaysian federal government has been <b>solely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> foreign policy and military forces in the country.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, the {{proposed}} visit of a South African team to England was subject of widespread public opposition. The MCC {{was no longer}} <b>solely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> any decisions, being {{only a part of}} the Cricket Council, but Allen pressed the government to intervene and decide whether the tour should go ahead. He believed it was a political matter outside the scope of cricket authorities; the government eventually became involved and the tour was cancelled.|$|E
50|$|Although historians {{say that}} the coffee {{production}} was the <b>solely</b> activity <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the sudden development, {{it is well known}} that the Brazilian economy during this time faced a deep diversification on its activities. Then these activities were driven to supply the country internal needs. Therefore, these products can be also considered as one of the factors that lead to Brazil's modernization.|$|R
50|$|As {{its name}} implies, this region is <b>responsible</b> <b>solely</b> <b>for</b> the {{province}} of Quebec (QC). Its main office is in Montreal, with one district office in Quebec City.|$|R
50|$|The {{representative}} for Miss Universe {{will be selected}} through the Miss Almaty contest whose organizer will <b>solely</b> be <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> funding the participation in the contest. Almaty is the largest city of Kazakhstan. Miss Almaty, however, will also qualify for Miss Kazakhstan. In the event she wins the Miss Kazakhstan title, she will go to both Miss World and Miss Universe provided there is no conflict.|$|R
5|$|Friends of the High Line {{has raised}} more than $150 million in public and private funds toward the {{construction}} of the first two sections of the High Line. Unlike the first two phases of the High Line, which the city contributed to significantly, Friends of the High Line was <b>solely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> raising funding for Phase 3, which is estimated to have cost roughly $35 million. Friends of the High Line raises more than 90 percent of the park's annual operating budget from private donations. A 2012 donation of $5 million from the city was controversial since the High Line received more funding that year than most city parks did, even though Friends of the High Line raised an extra $85 million that year.|$|E
5|$|In May 1923, {{the unit}} was renamed Stoßtrupp-Hitler ("Shock Troop-Hitler"). The unit was <b>solely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> Hitler's protection. On 9 November 1923 the Stoßtrupp, {{along with the}} SA and several other {{paramilitary}} units, {{took part in the}} Beer Hall Putsch in Munich. The plan was to seize control of the city in a coup d'état and then challenge the government in Berlin. The putsch was quickly crushed by the local police and resulted in the death of 16 Nazi supporters and 4 police officers. In the aftermath of the failed putsch both Hitler, Schreck, and other Nazi leaders were incarcerated at Landsberg Prison. The Nazi Party and all associated formations, including the Stoßtrupp, were officially disbanded.|$|E
5|$|When {{there were}} no signs of the POWs backing down on the third day, General Fukuye ordered the Commander of the British and Australian troops in Changi, Lt-Gen E. B. Holmes, and his deputy, Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Galleghan, to attend the {{execution}} of the four recent escapees — Breavington, Gale, Waters and Fletcher. One of the Australians, Breavington, pleaded to no avail that he was <b>solely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the escape attempt and should be the only one executed. Their executions were carried out by the Indian National Army guards with rifles on 2 September. The initial volley was non-fatal, and the wounded men had to plead to be finished off.|$|E
5000|$|After World War I, Assistant Commissioner [...] "B" [...] became <b>responsible</b> <b>solely</b> <b>for</b> {{traffic and}} lost property, {{with his other}} former duties divided between Assistant Commissioners [...] "A" [...] and [...] "L". Assistant Commissioner [...] "L" [...] was <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> [...] "L" [...] (Legal) Department until its {{reorganisation}} in 1931. After 1931, he was renamed Assistant Commissioner [...] "D" [...] and became <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> policy and planning.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} crew in {{a police}} helicopter consists of a pilot, <b>responsible</b> <b>solely</b> <b>for</b> operating and flying the aircraft; a front seat observer, <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> operating the helicopter's surveillance systems; and a rear seat observer, <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> communications using the tetra radio and downlink systems. Although both observers are often police officers, the pilot does not engage in any police activities and is usually not a police officer.|$|R
5000|$|Prevention and {{investigation}} in Brazil are divided between two distinct police organizations. Local [...] "military police" [...] forces only have order maintenance duties. Correspondingly, [...] "civil police" [...] institutions are <b>responsible</b> <b>solely</b> <b>for</b> crime investigation. However, {{at the federal}} level, the Federal Police is commissioned with both preventive and investigative functions of federal crimes.|$|R
5|$|Bicycles and {{motorcycles}} {{are both}} single-track vehicles and so their motions have many fundamental attributes in common and are {{fundamentally different from}} {{and more difficult to}} study than other wheeled vehicles such as dicycles, tricycles, and quadracycles. As with unicycles, bikes lack lateral stability when stationary, and under most circumstances can only remain upright when moving forward. Experimentation and mathematical analysis have shown that a bike stays upright when it is steered to keep its center of mass over its wheels. This steering is usually supplied by a rider, or in certain circumstances, by the bike itself. Several factors, including geometry, mass distribution, and gyroscopic effect all contribute in varying degrees to this self-stability, but long-standing hypotheses and claims that any single effect, such as gyroscopic or trail, is <b>solely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the stabilizing force have been discredited.|$|E
5|$|The Sultan {{responded to}} the ban by putting {{pressure}} on the state authorities to enforce isolation of the Johor hockey teams from all national tournaments. In November 1992, Douglas Gomez, a coach for the Maktab Sultan Abu Bakar field hockey team, expressed his displeasure of being called to withdraw from a semi-final national hockey match by the Director of the Johor Education Department. The incident {{attracted the attention of}} the Sultan, who personally summoned Gomez to his palace, Istana Bukit Serene, where he was promptly reprimanded and assaulted by the Sultan. Following Gomez's meeting with the Sultan, Gomez sought treatment to his face and stomach. Subsequently, he lodged a police report against the Sultan for assault. Gomez elaborated that the Sultan bodyguards, members of the Johor Military Force personnel, were merely onlookers, and that the Sultan was <b>solely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the injuries.|$|E
5|$|Logan's retrial {{began in}} June 2007, with the {{prosecution}} unable to use Logan's confession to present its case for conviction, for the judiciary had ruled {{that it had been}} obtained with impropriety. In the retrial, the prosecution used the same argument it had used in the original trial back in 2003, arguing that Logan's insanity defense was illegitimate due to his usage of illegal controlled substances. The state's prosecution argued that Logan himself was <b>solely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> any deficiencies in his mental health, saying that they were brought about through his consumption of illegal narcotics, such as cocaine and marijuana, two illegal controlled substances which he had used {{on the day of the}} murders. Ultimately, the first attempt at a retrial ended in June 2007 with a mistrial after jurors couldn't come to a verdict after ten hours of deliberations. On July 1, 2007, Logan's attorney died after being involved in an automobile collision on Route 10 in Glen Burnie, further complicating matters. However, a few months later, Logan was subsequently convicted again after pleading guilty and sentenced to thirty years imprisonment on October 24, 2007, with credit for the five years he had already served, much to the disappointment of the victims' surviving family members, who felt he deserved a lifelong imprisonment for his crime.|$|E
50|$|In 1656, under Louis XIV, the Vingt-quatre Violons were {{supplemented}} by an orchestra consisting of 16, later 21 strings. The new ensemble was called La petite bande, the Vingt-quatre Violons were dubbed La grande bande. In 1761, the orchestra was disbanded, mainly for financial reasons, and was {{merged with the}} Chapelle Royale, then <b>responsible</b> <b>solely</b> <b>for</b> religious festivities.|$|R
25|$|In {{the regions}} of {{shifting}} cultivation where polygyny is most frequently recorded, labor is often starkly divided between genders. The task of felling trees in preparation of new plots is usually done by older boys and very young men. Wives, on the other hand, are <b>solely</b> or primarily <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> giving birth and rearing children; cultivating, processing and providing food for the family; and for performing domestic duties for the husband.|$|R
50|$|In some countries, all {{air traffic}} control is {{performed}} by the military. In other countries, military controllers are <b>responsible</b> <b>solely</b> <b>for</b> military airspace and airbases; civilian controllers maintain airspace for civilian traffic and civilian airports. Historically, in most countries, {{this was part of}} the government and controllers were civil servants. However, many countries have partly or wholly privatized their {{air traffic control}} systems; others are looking to do the same.|$|R
5|$|The {{composition}} of the council can only {{be compared with the}} quite unique and unusual {{composition of}} the German upper house, the Bundesrat. Membership of the Bundesrat is limited to members of the governments of the states of Germany and can be recalled by those governments {{in the same manner as}} the EU's Council. They retain their state role while sitting in the Bundesrat and if their term ends when they are recalled by their state governments (who are <b>solely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> their appointment) or they cease to sit in their state government. Hence they also are not elected at the same time and the body as a whole cannot be dissolved like most parliaments. As government representatives, members do not vote as individual members but in state blocks, rather than political alignment, to their state governments' agreed line. Each state has unequal voting powers based on population, with an absolute majority required for decisions. Likewise, the presidency rotates equally between members, though each year rather than every six months like in the EU Council. However, unlike the EU's Council, the Bundesrat does not vary its composition depending on the topic being discussed. They both bear similar criticisms, because of the interference, of executives in the legislative process.|$|E

50|$|The Maryland Constitution of 1851 {{divided the}} State into four {{judicial}} districts. Voters of each district elected {{a judge to}} the Court of Appeals for a ten-year term. The Court became <b>responsible</b> <b>solely</b> <b>for</b> appellate duties and sat only at Annapolis, whereas before it sat in various locations throughout the State. Five judges, each elected from one of five judicial districts, were prescribed by the Maryland Constitution of 1864.|$|R
50|$|In 1923, the United Farmers of Alberta {{met with}} then Attorney General John Edward Brownlee to {{consider}} {{setting up a}} Wheat Pool just in Alberta. On the advice of Aaron Sapiro, a California lawyer they created a non share, non-profit organization <b>responsible</b> <b>solely</b> <b>for</b> selling wheat for the best advantage. It was set up as a one-man, one-vote organization, with a 5-year contract required to deliver 100% of his commercial wheat to the Pool.|$|R

40|$|This study explores how the {{participation}} of parents on school committees improves student achievement. In decentralized education systems {{like the one in}} Indonesia, parents’ participation has become a focal point for improving the quality of education. The data for this study were collected using questionnaires distributed to 250 students in state senior high schools, selected by quota-purposive sampling. The qualitative findings of this research are threefold: most parents participated in student learning only by providing material aspects, such as tuition and books; most parents had a misconception that it was the school that should <b>solely</b> be <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the education of their children; busy parents tended to ignore the progress of their children’s learning. In order to create social capital for their children, parents need to be active in the learning process, cooperate with school officials, and get involved in the planning of social activities. </p...|$|R
5|$|The Court {{added that}} there is a need for the {{decision-maker}} to adduce evidence in court to prove that considerations of national security are involved. A mere assertion by the decision-maker that a matter involves national security does not preclude the court's judicial function of determining whether the decision was in fact based on grounds of national security. In other words, national security cannot be raised as a plea in bar to prevent the court from considering an application at all. However, what the court cannot do is decide what action national security requires. This is to be left <b>solely</b> to those <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> it.|$|R

Such problems do push prices higher temporarily, but have not historically been fundamental to long-term price increases.|$|E

However, no single set of receptors is <b>solely</b> <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> the information the brain uses to control eating.|$|E
50|$|Political {{developments}} {{were also}} a fundamental cause of the uprising. The first meeting of the National Assembly, held on February 25, 1919, approved a resolution which reserved for Malta all the rights given to other nations by the Versailles peace conference; this would have meant independence from the British Empire. This resolution, tabled by the extremist nationalist faction led by Dr. Enrico Mizzi, was opposed to an original resolution by Dr. Filippo Sceberras which asked <b>solely</b> <b>for</b> <b>responsible</b> government. This moderate resolution was removed {{in order to secure}} unanimity, and to prevent a break between the moderate and extremist factions.|$|R
40|$|The {{important}} factors influencing landscape changes could be climate, geology, topography, plant succession, species extinction and species evolution. Human, since time immemorial, {{have influenced the}} landscape {{they live in a}} variety of ways resulting in varied land use changes. Increase in population leads to the expansion in agriculture land, built-up areas, uncontrolled forest fires, mining of minerals, extraction of timber and permanent plantations, which in turn are <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> habitat degradation and loss of biodiversity. Garo hills districts of Meghalaya are endowed with rich biodiversity both in terms of flora and fauna. With the increasing of population there is pressure exerted on these natural resources for the livelihood as there is hardly any alternative available. In the meantime small forest based urban centers were developed and with the expansion of these the requirement of the local people also changed. Due to urbanization and population pressure the traditional shifting cultivation (jhum), which is still the only livelihood of many areas of the Garo hills; have been converted into permanent cash crop areas. This conversion has a reverse impact on the environment. In the traditional jhumming method the native forests which were slushed and burned for agriculture purposes could revive in 18 to 20 years’ time (Jhum cycle). But due to the introduction of economically sound plantation crops like areca nut, cashew nut and tea the native diversity of the forest area is in the verse of extinction. The present study reveals that rapid population growth is the <b>solely</b> <b>responsible</b> factor <b>for</b> changes the landscape of Garo hills of Meghalaya...|$|R
40|$|Access to thesis {{permanently}} {{restricted to}} Ball State community onlyTeenage pregnancy rates continue to rise; therefore, preventing teenage pregnancy {{has become a}} very important concept in high school sexuality curriculum. Many schools have developed educational programs to help reduce the teenage pregnancy rate. The {{purpose of this study}} is to create a realistic parenting experience for teens (Sommers & Fahlman, 2001). Baby Think it Over (BTIO) is a classroom tool used to create unpredictable behaviors similar to a newborn. The framework for this study is the Health Belief Model developed in the 1950 s by Hochbaum, Rosenstock, & Kegels. Participants selected will be high school students with a mean age of 15. 8. An experimental group of 151 students will be selected with a control group of 62 students. All students will complete a pretest before the program begins. The students will then be <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> “parent time” in which they will be <b>solely</b> <b>responsible</b> in caring <b>for</b> the baby. All students will then take a posttest 10 - 12 weeks after all students finished using the doll. Findings will provide information on the BTIO program and if it changes teens’ perception of pregnancy.
