40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} the simulation {{results for the}} analysis of a lightning surge, <b>switching</b> <b>transients</b> and very fast transients within a thermal plant. The modeling of gas insulated substations (GIS) makes use of electrical equivalent circuits that are composed of lumped elements and distributed parameter lines. The system model also includes some generators, transformers, and low voltage circuits such as 24 V DC rectifiers and control circuits. This paper shows the simulation results, via EMTP (Electro-Magnetic Transients Program), for three overvoltage types, such as <b>transient</b> overvoltages, <b>switching</b> <b>transients,</b> very fast transients and a lightning surge...|$|R

40|$|There are {{numerous}} modeling approaches and algorithms for the simulation of high-voltage transmission networks with {{various degrees of}} accuracy and computational complexity. For the simulation of <b>switching</b> <b>transients,</b> the so-called Bergeron model {{is perhaps the most}} widely used approach as implemented in the renowned Electromagnetic Transients Program (EMTP). Therein, the transmission line is represented as forward and backward current waves implemented using standard queues with purely algebraic boundary equations. This representation is very efficient for the calculation of switching transients; however, it is inherently a fixed-time-step approach that is not conducive to the study of longer-term transient and dynamical phenomena such as the inter-area inertial oscillations that occur following major disturbances and can lead to transient instabilities. This restriction has led to a completely separate class of computer programs, i. e. transient stability programs, in which electromagnetic transients are completely neglected. In this thesis, a new transmission line modeling structure is set forth that is able to accurately portray the high-frequency <b>switching</b> <b>transients</b> but has a dynamically changing order and structure so that, after the fast <b>switching</b> <b>transients</b> subside, the lower-frequency phenomena can be simulated using a much larger and variable time step. It is argued that the resulting transmission line structure accurately portrays <b>switching</b> <b>transients</b> and, concurrently, is much more efficient than the Bergeron model when simulating long-term transients. The significance of the proposed transmission line modeling structure is that it obviates the need for separate computer programs that focus on specific time frames. ...|$|R
50|$|The Turn-OFF <b>switching</b> <b>transient</b> of silicon-based power bipolar {{semiconductor}} devices, caused by stored {{charge in the}} device during the forward conduction state, limits switching speed of the device, which in turn limits {{the efficiency of the}} application it is used within.|$|E
50|$|A {{programmable}} load {{is a type}} of {{test equipment}} or instrument which emulates DC or AC resistance loads normally required to perform functional tests of batteries, power supplies or solar cells.

50|$|A {{variation}} of the omega wrap, such as that used by Echo Science Corporation of Mountain View, California in its instrumentation and high resolution video recorders in the late 1970s and 1980s, wraps the 1-inch tape about 190 degrees around the two-headed drum, so there is signal overlap between the two heads. Head switching in video recorders occurs instantaneously in the video models, during an horizontal sync interval. With a standard NTSC video signal a head can cover one sixth of a field each time it passed across the tape. Switching in instrumentation models is gradual, so the signals from both heads overlaps briefly, producing a transient-free output signal where the original signal does not contain convenient dead intervals during which a <b>switching</b> <b>transient</b> can be hidden.|$|E

40|$|This letter {{investigates the}} {{electrothermal}} stability of MOSFETs during <b>switching</b> <b>transients.</b> Switch-mode MOSFETs, when transiting between the {{opposite ends of}} the load line, pass through bias conditions with high thermal runaway probability, i. e., RTH · VDS · dIDS/dT >; 1. It is shown here that the likelihood of thermal runaway increases when dIDS/dT is positive and the switching duration is greater than the thermal time constant. This condition is worse for advanced MOSFETs with high transconductance because the zero-temperature-crossover point occurs at higher drain currents.

40|$|Abstract—Switching {{transients}} {{associated with}} circuit breakers {{have been observed}} for many years. With the widespread applica-tion of vacuum breakers for transformer switching, recently, this phenomenon {{has been attributed to}} a significant number of trans-former failures. Vacuum circuit breaker switching of electric arc furnace and ladle melt furnace (LMF) transformers raises concern because of their inductive currents. High-frequency transients and overvoltages result when the vacuum breaker exhibits virtual current chop and multiple re-ignitions.
