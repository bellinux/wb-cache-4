30|$|The {{tribological}} {{behaviors of}} {{two types of}} seal coatings, nickel–graphite and aluminum–hexagon-boron nitride (Ni–Cg and Al–hBN, respectively) versus a Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade used in turbofan engines were investigated using a high-speed rubbing test. The wear status and damage mechanism of the friction couples were studied and the abradability of the seal coatings was evaluated. By analysis of the coating properties and damage mechanism of the <b>seal</b> <b>couple,</b> the friction heat effect was identified as the key factor influencing blade wear forms as well as coating abradability. A one-dimensional heat conduction model was established to estimate the effect of increasing temperature on the friction interface. The results indicated that in the Ni–Cg and Ti– 6 Al– 4 V <b>seal</b> <b>couple,</b> the temperature rising rate (TRR) of the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade was faster {{than that of the}} Ni–Cg coating, and so the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade softened earlier than the Ni–Cg coating, causing the blade to suffer severe wear. In the Al–hBN and Ti– 6 Al– 4 V <b>seal</b> <b>couple,</b> the TRR of the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V blade was slower than that of the Al–hBN coating, and so the Al–hBN coating softened first; thus, blade damage was reduced or even replaced by coating adhesion. The square root ratio of thermal diffusivity between the blade and the coating could be taken as an indicator of the ratio of TRR between the blade and coating to predict blade wear status as well as damage mechanism. The results of the model agreed well with the experiment results of the two <b>seal</b> <b>couples</b> used in this study.|$|R

Answering this question is not straightforward, {{partly because of the}} arduous task of accurately estimating longevity in wild animals, and of the statistical difficulties in correlating time-varying ecological covariables with a single number (time-to-event). Here we investigated the relationship between foraging strategy and life-span in an elusive and large marine predator: the Southern Elephant Seal (Mirounga leonina). Using teeth recovered from dead males on îles Kerguelen, Southern Ocean, we first aged specimens. Then we used stable isotopic measurements of carbon ([Formula: see text]) in dentin to study the effect of foraging location on individual life-span. Using a joint change-point/survival modelling approach which enabled us to describe the ontogenetic trajectory of foraging, we unveiled how a stable foraging strategy developed early in life positively covaried with longevity in male Southern Elephant <b>Seals.</b> <b>Coupled</b> with an appropriate statistical analysis, stable isotopes have the potential to tackle ecological questions of long standing interest but whose answer has been hampered by logistic constraints...|$|R

40|$|Integrated {{modeling}} of basin- and plume-scale processes induced by full-scale deployment of CO{sub 2 } storage {{was applied to}} the Mt. Simon Aquifer in the Illinois Basin. A three-dimensional mesh was generated with local refinement around 20 injection sites, with approximately 30 km spacing. A total annual injection rate of 100 Mt CO{sub 2 } over 50 years was used. The CO{sub 2 }-brine flow at the plume scale and the single-phase flow at the basin scale were simulated. Simulation results show the overall shape of a CO{sub 2 } plume consisting of a typical gravity-override subplume in the bottom injection zone of high injectivity and a pyramid-shaped subplume in the overlying multilayered Mt. Simon, indicating the important role of a secondary seal with relatively low-permeability and high-entry capillary pressure. The secondary-seal effect is manifested by retarded upward CO{sub 2 } migration as a result of multiple secondary <b>seals,</b> <b>coupled</b> with lateral preferential CO{sub 2 } viscous fingering through high-permeability layers. The plume width varies from 9. 0 to 13. 5 km at 200 years, indicating the slow CO{sub 2 } migration and no plume interference between storage sites. On the basin scale, pressure perturbations propagate quickly away from injection centers, interfere after less than 1 year, and eventually reach basin margins. The simulated pressure buildup of 35 bar in the injection area is not expected to affect caprock geomechanical integrity. Moderate pressure buildup is observed in Mt. Simon in northern Illinois. However, its impact on groundwater resources is less than the hydraulic drawdown induced by long-term extensive pumping from overlying freshwater aquifers...|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 39 - 48 The {{appearance}} of a strong subsynchronous instability in an overhung compressor highlights the fact that rotordynamic instabilities are not restricted to high-pressure multistage between bearing compressors with overhung rotors. Another {{important point is that}} many users mistakenly believe that tilting pad bearings eliminate all cross-coupling forces that cause subsynchronous instability. While this is true of the cross-coupling coefficients of the bearings themselves, a substantial cross-coupling coefficients of the bearings themselves, a substantial cross, coupling force from labyrinth seals can overcome the beneficial characteristics of tilting pad bearings. This paper describes the installation of an integrally geared compressor that initially had problems with high bearing pad temperatures. The manufacturer attempted to modify the bearings to reduce the pad temperatures but this was unsuccessful due to unacceptable high vibration amplitudes caused by rotordynamic instability. The rotordynamic instability was caused by a strong subsynchronous excitation of a cantilevered rotor natural frequency located at 47 percent of running speed. The subsynchronous excitation was due to labyrinth <b>seal</b> cross <b>coupling</b> effects. Based on the recommendation of the authors, the manufacturer installed swirl brakes to decrease the subsynchronous vibration excitation, which eliminated the rotordynamic instability and allowed the bearings to be modified in order to reduce bearing pad temperatures...|$|R

Bycatch was estimated using the traditional stratified ratio technique and a GLM-based approach. Bycatch rates were then applied to the landing statistics for the target species for the whole fleet to estimate total bycatch. The stratified ratio estimates ranged from 2211 (CV 0. 16) to 3218 (CV 0. 17) harbour porpoises, 459 (CV 0. 24) to 565 (CV 0. 18) harbour seals and 68 (CV 0. 27) to 128 (CV 0. 41) grey seals.

A lumped parameter model for a single gland <b>seal</b> with <b>coupling</b> to an upstream cavity with leakage is developed along with an appropriate solution technique. From this theory, it is shown {{that the presence of}} the upstream cavity can, in some cases, augment the cross-stiffness and direct damping by a factor of four. The parameters that govern the coupling are presented along with predictions on their influence. A simple uncoupled model is used to identify the mechanisms responsible for cross force generation. This reduced system is nondimensionalized and the physical significance of the reduced parameters is discussed. Closed form algebraic formulas are given for some simple limiting cases. It is also shown that the total cross-force predicted by the uncoupled model can be represented as the sum of an ideal component due to an inviscid flow with entry swirl and a viscous part due to the change in swirl created by friction inside the gland. The frequency dependent ideal part is solely responsible for the rotordynamic direct damping. The facility designed and built to measure these frequency dependent forces is described.
