5000|$|A reactor design whose {{inherently}} safe process directly provides a passive <b>safety</b> <b>component</b> during a specific failure condition in all operational modes is typically described as relatively fail-safe to that failure condition. [...] However most current water-cooled and -moderated reactors, when scrammed, can not remove residual production and decay heat without either process heat transfer or the active cooling system. In other words, whilst the {{inherently safe}} heat transfer process provides a passive <b>safety</b> <b>component</b> preventing excessive heat while the reactor is operating, the same inherently safe heat transfer process {{does not provide}} a passive <b>safety</b> <b>component</b> if the reactor is shut down (SCRAMed). The Three Mile Island accident exposed this design deficiency: the reactor and steam generator were shut down but with loss of coolant it still suffered a partial meltdown.|$|E
50|$|The {{pebble bed}} reactor {{is an example}} of a reactor exhibiting an {{inherently}} safe process that is also capable of providing a passive <b>safety</b> <b>component</b> for all operational modes. As the temperature of the fuel rises, Doppler broadening increases the probability that neutrons are captured by U-238 atoms. This reduces the chance that the neutrons are captured by U-235 atoms and initiate fission, thus reducing the reactor's power output and placing an inherent upper limit on the temperature of the fuel. The geometry and design of the fuel pebbles provides an important passive <b>safety</b> <b>component.</b>|$|E
50|$|Single fluid {{fluoride}} {{molten salt}} reactors feature fissile, fertile and actinide radioisotopes in molecular bonds with the fluoride coolant. The molecular bonds provide a passive safety feature in that a loss-of-coolant event corresponds with a loss-of-fuel event. The molten fluoride fuel can not itself reach criticality but only reaches criticality {{by the addition}} of a neutron reflector such as pyrolytic graphite. The higher density of the fuel along with additional lower density FLiBe fluoride coolant without fuel provides a flotation layer passive <b>safety</b> <b>component</b> in which lower density graphite that breaks off control rods or an immersion matrix during mechanical failure does not induce criticality. Gravity driven drainage of reactor liquids provides a passive <b>safety</b> <b>component.</b>|$|E

50|$|Lilly, American Cyanamid, Upjohn, and Monsanto all {{submitted}} applications to market rBST to the U.S. FDA, and the FDA completed its {{review of the}} human <b>safety</b> <b>component</b> of these applications in 1986 and found food from rBST-treated cows to be safe; however, strong public concern led to calls for more studies, investigations, and public discussions, which included an unprecedented conference on the safety of rBST in 1990 organized by the National Institutes of Health {{at the request of}} Sen. Patrick Leahy. FDA approved Monsanto's application in 1993. Monsanto launched rBST, brand-named Posilac, in 1994.|$|E
50|$|Reactors {{could be}} {{fitted with a}} {{hydraulic}} safety system component that increases the inflow pressure of coolant (esp. water) in response to increased outflow pressure of the moderator and coolant without control system intervention. Such reactors would be described as fitted with such a passive <b>safety</b> <b>component</b> that could - if so designed - render in a reactor a negative void coefficient of reactivity, regardless of the operational property of the reactor {{in which it is}} fitted. The feature would only work if it responded faster than an emerging (steam) void and the reactor components could sustain the increased coolant pressure. A reactor fitted with both safety features - if designed to constructively interact - {{is an example of a}} safety interlock. Rarer operational failure modes could render both such safety features useless and detract from the overall relative safety of the reactor.|$|E
50|$|The notorious RBMK {{graphite}} moderated, water-cooled reactors of Chernobyl Power Plant disaster {{were designed}} {{with a positive}} void coefficient with boron control rods on electromagnetic grapples for reaction speed control. To the degree that the control systems were reliable, this design did have a corresponding degree of active inherent safety. The reactor was unsafe at low power levels because erroneous control rod movement would have a counter-intuitively magnified effect. Chernobyl Reactor 4 was built instead with manual crane driven boron control rods that were tipped with the moderator substance, graphite, a neutron reflector. It was designed with an Emergency Core Cooling System (ECCS) that depended on either grid power or the backup Diesel generator to be operating. The ECCS <b>safety</b> <b>component</b> was decidedly not passive. The design featured a partial containment consisting of a concrete slab {{above and below the}} reactor - with pipes and rods penetrating, an inert gas filled metal vessel to keep oxygen away from the water-cooled hot graphite, a fire-proof roof, and the pipes below the vessel sealed in secondary water filled boxes. The roof, metal vessel, concrete slabs and water boxes are examples of passive safety components. The roof in the Chernobyl Power Plant complex was made of bitumen - against design - rendering it ignitable. Unlike the Three Mile Island accident, neither the concrete slabs nor the metal vessel could contain a steam, graphite and oxygen driven hydrogen explosion. The water boxes could not sustain high pressure failure of the pipes. The passive safety components as designed were inadequate to fulfill the safety requirements of the system.|$|E

Buffer testing involved impacting them with the maximum and minimum mass at tripping speeds to ensure decelerations were within that requirement by the standard in both cases the aim was to ensure if the lift ever went into free fall or uncontrolled downward movement the <b>safety</b> <b>components</b> stopped the lift without causing any serious injury to the occupant.
