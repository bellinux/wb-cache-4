5|$|In her {{arguments}} for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos {{in opposition to}} what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Influenced by Enlightenment thinkers, she believed in progress and derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She argues for rationality, pointing out that Burke's system {{would lead to the}} continuation of slavery, simply because it had been an ancestral tradition. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family can have a farm that will just suit its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with what <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> genuine feeling, to Burke's false feeling.|$|E

It is said in the Principia Discordia that Eris says {{different}} things to each listener. She may even say radically different things to each Episkopos but, all of what <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> equally her word (even if it contradicts another iteration of her word).|$|E
25|$|The , dark-blue, extra-long twin {{mattress}} used in {{the performance}} art piece is of the kind Columbia places in its dorms, {{similar to the one}} on which she alleges she was raped. Sulkowicz spent the summer of 2014 creating the rules of engagement: Written on the walls of her studio in the university's Watson Hall, these state that she must carry the mattress whenever she is on university property; that it must remain on campus even when Sulkowicz is not there; and that she is not allowed to ask for help in carrying it, but if help is offered she may accept it. In September that year she began carrying it on campus, which <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> a physically painful experience.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} made using {{hand-drawn}} traditional animation, with pencil on paper, and then scanned and digitally coloured, with {{about half of}} the animation by Kove, and the rest divided between animators in Montreal and Norway. Kove's style is simplistic, which <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> less a specific style choice than [...] "quite simply [...] the only one I know how to do." [...] The backgrounds were painted by Montreal artist Anne Ashton.|$|E

500|$|Marge's raspy {{voice is}} only {{slightly}} different from Kavner's, who has a [...] "honeyed gravel voice" [...] which <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> due to [...] "a bump on [...] vocal cords." [...] While Marge is her most famous character, Kavner's favorite characters to voice are Patty and Selma because [...] "they're really funny and sad at the same time." [...] In The Simpsons Movie, some scenes, such as Marge's video message to Homer, were recorded over one hundred times, leaving Kavner exhausted.|$|E
500|$|According to Dorothy Yamamoto, the {{significant}} {{themes in the}} tale are [...] "solidity and vacancy, substance and illusion". The cheese that apparently resides in the well is only an illusion, not a solid object, and similarly the fox creates a surface reconciliation between the wolf and the husbandman, but which betrays his real intentions. Through their frequent misuse, words that should convey real value are emptied of meaning. As an example, Yamamoto highlights the fox's taill on which the wolf and husbandman make their pledge—which body part <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> used by the fox in other tales to blind his foes, and is thereby a highly inappropriate object to use.|$|E
500|$|Angelou chose [...] "Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie" [...] as the volume's title {{because of}} her {{interest}} in unconscious innocence, which <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> [...] "even lovelier than trying to remain innocent." [...] The title is a reference to her belief that [...] "we as individuals... are still so innocent that we think if we asked our murderer just before he puts the final wrench upon the throat, 'Would you please give me a cool drink of water?' and he would do so'". [...] Angelou has said that if she [...] "didn't believe that, [...] wouldn't {{get up in the}} morning".|$|E

500|$|The Cantos is {{difficult}} to decipher. In the epic poem, Pound disregards literary genres, mixing satire, hymns, elegies, essays and memoirs. Pound scholar Rebecca Beasley believes it amounts to {{a rejection of the}} 19th-century nationalistic approach in favor of early-20th-century comparative literature. Pound reaches across cultures and time periods, assembling and juxtaposing [...] "themes and history" [...] from Homer to Ovid and Dante, from Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, and many others. The work presents a multitude of protagonists as [...] "travellers between nations". The nature of The Cantos, <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>is</b> to compare and measure among historical periods and cultures and against [...] "a Poundian standard" [...] of modernism.|$|E
500|$|Chi first appears atop a trash pile in {{an alley}} where she is found by Hideki Motosuwa, a high school {{graduate}} who knows very little about computers or the androids known as [...] "persocoms" [...] (personal computers) that have become the fashionable item {{to have in the}} city. Unlike other persocoms, her activation switch is located in an unusual place: her crotch. She has difficulty communicating with Hideki at first; the only word that <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> [...] "chi", which becomes her given name, but slowly she learns how to speak. Having no memory of her past life, she is taught by Hideki to perform simple tasks. Hideki's neighbor Shinbo and computer prodigy Minoru determine that Chi is no ordinary persocom, and may be a legendary [...] "Chobit", possessing synthetic intelligence.|$|E
500|$|One {{explanation}} for this continuing popularity is that the Hardy Boys are simple wish fulfillment. Their adventures allow readers to vicariously experience {{an escape from the}} mundane. At the same time, Frank and Joe live ordinary lives when not solving mysteries, allowing readers to identify with characters who seem realistic and whose parents and authority figures are unfailingly supportive and loving. The Hardy Boys also embody an ideal of masculinity: by their very name they [...] "set the stage for a gentrified version of hardiness and constructed hardiness as an ideal for modern American males", part of the [...] "cultural production of self-control and mastery as the revered ideal for the American man." [...] More controversially, to Meredith Wood, the characters embody not just an ideal of masculinity, but an ideal of white masculinity. She tries to argue that [...] "racist stereotypes are ... fundamental {{to the success of the}} Hardy Boys series." [...] In support of this claim, Wood cites what <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> the replacement of one stereotype (evil Chinese) with another (evil Latin Americans) in the original and revised versions of Footprints Under the Window. She further claims that this is the reason for the popularity of the Applewood Books reprints of the original, unrevised texts rather that the widely cited blandness of the rewrites.|$|E

Sudha gets it and asks how Pammi <b>is.</b> Chandar <b>says</b> the place <b>was</b> interesting with roses, Pammi is an open minded girl and he liked meeting her, now if she would tell him where Mr. Shukla is.

2500|$|Additionally, Leonore Tiefer of NYU School of Medicine voiced {{concerns}} {{that the success of}} Viagra, in combination with feminist rhetoric, were being used as a means of fast-tracking public acceptance of pharmaceutical treatment of female sexual arousal disorder. The justification behind this, <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>is</b> that [...] "the branding of Viagra has succeeded so thoroughly in rationalizing the idea of sexual correction and enhancement through pills that it seems inevitable and only fair that such a product be made available for women", giving a dangerous appeal to [...] "nonapproved drugs though off-label prescribing." ...|$|E

In almost all instances, a woman’s right to abortion may hinge on the doctor’s willingness to perform it. If the doctor refuses, then the woman is denied her right. To base the woman’s right on the accordance or refusal of a doctor, <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>is</b> to ignore the mother’s full personhood, and subsequently, her rights to her body.

But all the same it's astonishing what variety of quiet desperation and low misery and high comedy he manages to encompass in this book. Let's skip his defects, shall we?

Kumiko suggests starting by looking in the alley, a closed-off strip of land existing behind their house. After Toru has hung {{out there for a}} while with no luck, May Kasahara, who had been watching him camping out the alley for some time, questions him. She then invites him over to her house in order to sit on the patio and look over an abandoned house that <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> a popular hangout for stray cats. The abandoned house is revealed to possibly contain some strange omen, as it had brought bad luck to all of its prior tenants. It also contains an empty well, which Toru uses later on to crawl into and think.|$|E
2500|$|Critic Joseph Conte {{describes}} the epic {{as a long}} poem that [...] "has to have grand voice and purpose[...] [...] it has to say something big." [...] Lynn Keller describes one of the epic's aspects as including a [...] "quasi-circular quest-journey structure" [...] that <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>is</b> present in the long poem Song of Myself by Whitman. [...] Yet that long poem, Keller notes, {{does not have a}} [...] "specified end toward which the poem or speaker is directed," [...] unlike a more traditional long poem. [...] Though long poems do have roots in the epic form, that does not mean long poems that are epic-like are completely epic. [...] A second example of long poems distancing themselves from the traditional epic form is seen in Helen In Egypt by H.D. [...] Though traditional epics feature physical quests or journeys, Helen In Egypt is about the psychological journey of Helen.|$|E
