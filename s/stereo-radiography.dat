40|$|AbstractKnee joint {{kinematics}} {{derived from}} multi-body optimisation (MBO) still requires evaluation. The {{objective of this}} study was to corroborate model-derived kinematics of osteoarthritic knees obtained using four generic knee joint models used in musculoskeletal modelling ? spherical, hinge, degree-of-freedom coupling curves and parallel mechanism ? against reference knee kinematics measured by <b>stereo-radiography.</b> Root mean square errors ranged from 0. 7 ° to 23. 4 ° for knee rotations and from 0. 6 to 9. 0 mm for knee displacements. Model-derived knee kinematics computed from generic knee joint models was inaccurate. Future developments and experiments should improve the reliability of osteoarthritic knee models in MBO and musculoskeletal modelling...|$|E
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{presentation of}} arrangements and materials for detection of reinforced concrete {{by means of}} gamma-radiography is the first aim of this paper. New proposals concerning auxiliary techniques in gamma-radiography have been investigated: a) Photometric measurements on simple gamma-radiographies have been applied, in order to estimate the diameter of an embedded bar, {{on the basis of}} the difference in film density, between the image of the bar and its surrounding area. b) Ordinary photogrammetric apparatuses have been used on twin stereo-radiographies for direct discrimination of complicated bars of concrete reinforcements. The same method has been applied for a direct reading of the position and diameter of every bar simultaneously, instead of repetitive application of two-equations systems for each bar in conventional <b>stereo-radiography.</b> © 1971 Secrétariat de Rédaction...|$|E
40|$|Background: This {{study has}} aimed {{to measure the}} patient dose in entire spine {{radiography}} by EOS system {{in comparison with the}} digital radiography. Methods: EOS <b>stereo-radiography</b> was used for frontal and lateral view spine imaging in 41 patients in a prospective analytical study. A calibrated dose area product (DAP) meter was used for calibration of the DAP in EOS system. The accuracy and precision of the system was confirmed according to the acceptance testing. The same procedure was used for 18 patients referred for lumbar spine digital radiology (overall 36 images). Results: Although radiation fields in the EOS were almost twice of that in digital radiology, and the average peak tube voltage (kVp), current supply to the tube (mA), and the average size and age of the patients referred for EOS imaging were greater than digital radiology, however, the average DAP in EOS was 1 / 5 of that in digital radiology system. Also, the average dose in the EOS was about 1 / 20 of that in digital radiology. Conclusion: The patient dose in EOS imaging system was lower in comparison with digital radiology (1 / 20) ...|$|E
40|$|Non-operative {{treatment}} of Achilles tendon ruptures {{is associated with}} an increased risk of rerupture. We hypothesized that this is due to inferior mechanical properties during an early phase of healing, and performed a randomized trial, using a new method to measure the mechanical properties. Tantalum markers were inserted in the tendon stumps, and tendon strain at different loadings was measured by <b>stereo-radiography</b> (Roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis) at 3, 7 and 19 weeks and 18 months after injury. Thirty patients were randomized to operative or non-operative treatment. The primary out-come variable was an estimate for the modulus of elasticity at 7 weeks. Strain per force, cross-sectional area and tendon elongation were also measured. The functional outcome variable was the heel-raise index after 18 months. There was no difference in the mean modulus of elasticity or other mechanical or functional variables between operative and non-operative treatments at any time-point, but strain per force at 7 and 19 weeks had a significantly larger variation in the non-operative group. This group, therefore, might contain more outliers with poor healing. The modulus of elasticity at 7 weeks correlated with the heel-raise index after 18 months in both treatment groups (r 2 = 0. 75; P= 0. 0001). This correlation is an intriguing finding.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the feasibility of using an animal model of axonal injury to study the biomechanics of the injury. The model utilises anaesthetised sheep that are mechanically ventilated and stabilised before being subjected to a single lateral impact from a captive bolt gun. The impact force was measured using a load cell mounted in the striker, and the resulting head acceleration was measured by means of a 9 -accelerometer array which was rigidly mounted {{to the head of the}} sheep. Head kinematics were transformed to anatomical coordinates using <b>stereo-radiography.</b> High speed cine film (1000 fps) was used for the visualisation of gross head motion. After impact, each animal was allowed to survive for a predetermined period during which anaesthesia was maintained. A complement of physiological monitors was used to measure the physiological state of the animal at all times during the experiment. In one experiment, hypqxia was induced after the physical insult. After the survival period, the animal was sacrificed and the brain removed for histological processing. The brain was sectioned, processed and examined for axonal injury using the presence of amyloid precursor protein (APP) as an indicator of injury. The distribution of axonal injury in serial sections of the brain was mapped and quantified. Five experiments, displaying a range of injury responses, are reported on in this paper. In the future, the model will be used to study the biomechanics of axonal injury. R. W. G. Anderson, C. J. Brown, G. Scott, P. C. Blumbergs, J. W. Finnie, A. J. McLean, N. R. Jone...|$|E
40|$|This {{report has}} {{documented}} the worked {{performed in the}} x-ray computed tomographic and stereo-radiographic inspection of the NA- 42 test object. We have described the method SRNL used to obtain high resolution (80 micron) images of the test object using PSL plates. The PSL plates are an excellent alternative to x-ray film and they {{eliminate the need for}} the wet chemistry processing and the disposal of the chemical wastes. The PSL plates were used to provide an overall panoramic view of the large test object. These images were useful in planning other inspection techniques. In addition, a customized digital radiography system with an 85 -inch wide field-of-view was assembled to support the data collection for computed tomography. The trade-offs between resolution and data collection and CT reconstruction time were explained in detail. The CT projections and reconstructed slices of the test object were included in the report as static images and ''movies'' were also provided on the attached CD-ROM. The combination of the projections and the CT slices provide a thorough understanding of the internal structure of the device. The full projection CT results were also used as a ''bench mark'' for other techniques investigated during this work, such as the limited view CT and stereo-radiographic work. The limited view CT results were obtained by parsing the full data set into subsets with larger angular intervals and thus fewer projections. These subsets were then processed with the CT reconstruction software. The results of reconstructions from 720 down to 10 projections were compared. Based on these results, we concluded that 20 to 30 projections were adequate. These results were then used to predict the required data collection time for higher resolution systems. It was concluded that from a data collection time basis, limited view CT could provide the desired resolution (1 mm) within a reasonable period of time. However, there were other considerations related to actual field conditions that might preclude the use of CT. Consequently, SRNL also investigated other techniques. If the objective of the inspection is to provide the coordinates of key components of an IND, then CT is not needed. SRNL has shown that <b>stereo-radiography</b> using relative object-imaging system rotation or source translation are both effective in providing accurate targeting information. A detailed explanation, including examples, of these techniques was provided in this report. SRNL also believes that the accuracy of the techniques can be dramatically improved in future work, because several key parameters were measured using a tape measure. For example, a 3 -D fiducial array could be used to determine key parameters without a need for direct measurement. A higher degree of accuracy in the determination of those parameters will enhance the accuracy of the overall technique. In addition, since the actual internal geometry of the test object was unknown, the CT results were used to validate the other methods. However, the calculated error in the target coordinates were on the order of the resolution of the CT results (0. 109 inches). A better test of the techniques would be to construct a test object where the target points are measured with a higher degree of accuracy than the technique to be proven. A brief discussion on the usefulness of stereo-graphic vision equipment was also included. The main benefit of this method is to provide field personnel with qualitative '' 3 -D'' information without the need to collect a CT dataset or perform a tomographic reconstruction. Based on these results, SRNL recommends that the best approach at determining target locations is to utilize the <b>stereo-radiography</b> approach using source translations and fiducial markers. Lastly, the PSL plates or ASi flat panel imagers offer the most practical detector choice for a field application...|$|E
40|$|A new {{methodology}} for subject-specific finite element (FE) modeling of the tibiofemoral (TF) joint based on in vivo computed tomography (CT), {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI), and dynamic <b>stereo-radiography</b> (DSX) data is presented. Two techniques to incorporate in vivo skeletal kinematics as FE boundary conditions were implemented and compared: one used MRI-measured tibiofemoral kinematics in a non-weight-bearing supine position and allowed five degrees of freedom at the joint {{in response to an}} axially applied force; the other used DSX-measured tibiofemoral kinematics in a weight-bearing standing position and permitted only axial translation in response to the same force. The model-predicted cartilage-cartilage contact areas were examined against ‘benchmarks’ from a novel in situ contact area analysis (ISCAA) in which the intersection volume between non-deformed femoral and tibial cartilage was characterized to determine the contact. The results showed that the DSX-based model predicted contact areas in close alignment with the benchmarks, and outperformed the MRI-based model. The importance of accurate, task-specific skeletal kinematics in subject-specific FE modeling and the necessity of subject-specific verification are discussed. A study of the effects of partial meniscectomy on the intra-articular contact mechanics was then conducted as an illustration of application of the verified models. A musculoskeletal dynamic model was used to generate the knee joint forces as boundary conditions for the above developed FE models. Thus, a sequence of quasi-static position-dependent FE models was developed for a series of time points throughout a decline walking task. These time points include heel-strike and in increments of 0. 05 seconds up to 0. 30 seconds, and additionally, the time points of the two peak compressive joint force values for each knee. Several factors were observed to measure the effects on intra-articular contact mechanics. The greatest maximum compressive stress was recorded in the partially meniscectomized compartment or in the opposite compartment of the contralateral knee throughout all time points. The significance of the application of the FE models for evaluation of the biomechanical effects of meniscectomy is demonstrated, and the importance of simultaneously observing joint kinematics and intra-articular contact mechanics at more than one time point during a dynamic task is discussed. ...|$|E
