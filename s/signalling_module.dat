Precisely how environmental signals are sensed by yeast cells to trigger quiescence and gametogenesis is not fully understood. A conserved <b>signalling</b> <b>module</b> consisting of Greatwall kinase, Endosulfine and Protein Phosphatase PP 2 ACdc 55 proteins regulates entry into mitosis in Xenopus egg extracts and meiotic maturation in flies. We report here that an analogous <b>signalling</b> <b>module</b> consisting of the serine-threonine kinase Rim 15, the Endosulfines Igo 1 and Igo 2 and the Protein Phosphatase PP 2 ACdc 55, regulates entry into both quiescence and gametogenesis in budding yeast. PP 2 ACdc 55 inhibits entry into gametogenesis and quiescence. Rim 15 promotes entry into gametogenesis and quiescence by converting Igo 1 into an inhibitor of PP 2 ACdc 55 by phosphorylating at a conserved serine residue. Moreover, we show that the Rim 15 -Endosulfine-PP 2 ACdc 55 pathway regulates entry into quiescence and gametogenesis by distinct mechanisms. In addition, we show that Igo 1 and Igo 2 are required for pre-meiotic autophagy {{but the lack of}} pre-meiotic autophagy is insufficient to explain the sporulation defect of igo 1 D igo 2 D cells.

40|$|The {{non-structural}} protein 1 (A/NS 1) of influenza A viruses (IAV) harbours several src-homology domain (SH) binding motifs {{that are required}} for interaction with cellular proteins. The SH 3 binding motif at aa 212 - 217 [PPLPPK] of A/NS 1 was shown to be essential for binding to the cellular adaptor proteins CRK and CRKL. Both regulate diverse cellular effector pathways, including activation of the MAP-kinase JNK that in turn mediates antiviral responses to IAV infection. By studying functional consequences of A/NS 1 –CRK interaction we show here that A/NS 1 binding to CRK contributes to suppression of the antiviral-acting JNK–ATF 2 pathway. However, only IAV that encode an A/NS 1 -protein harbouring the CRK/CRKL SH 3 binding motif PPLPPK were attenuated upon downregulation of CRKI/II and CRKL, but not of CRKII alone. The PPLPPK site-harbouring candidate strains could be discriminated from other strains by a pronounced viral activation of the JNK–ATF 2 <b>signalling</b> <b>module</b> that was even further boosted upon knock-down of CRKI/II. Interestingly, this enhanced JNK activation did not alter type-I IFN-expression, but rather resulted in increased levels of virus-induced cell death.

This diversity is seen among different types of tumours and even between tumours that originate from the same tissue. Despite the complexity of these mutations, the cancer signalling map allows them to be divided into a few common <b>signaling</b> <b>modules</b> and therefore uncovers the underlying logic of cancer signaling. Both common and tumor-type specific <b>signaling</b> <b>modules</b> are observed. The common module contains genes that are frequently mutated in most tumors regardless of tumor-type. However, the common module is generally not sufficient for tumorigenesis, because mutations of the genes in the common module are frequently accompanied by mutations in one or two other <b>signaling</b> <b>modules.</b> Different tumor types appear to achieve tumorigenesis via distinct mechanisms, i. e., through collaboration between different <b>signaling</b> <b>modules.</b> Taking a systems-biology approach, the researchers present a network view of molecular mechanisms of cancer signaling that will shape our understanding of fundamental tumor cell biology. |$|R

40|$|The {{essential}} {{roles of}} SHH in anteroposterior (AP) and AER-FGF signalling in proximodistal (PD) limb bud development are well understood. In addition, these morphoregulatory signals are {{key components of}} the self-regulatory SHH/GREM 1 /AER-FGF feedback signalling system that regulates distal progression of limb bud development. This study uncovers an additional <b>signalling</b> <b>module</b> required for coordinated progression of limb bud axis development. Transcriptome analysis using Shh-deficient mouse limb buds revealed that the expression of proximal genes was distally extended from early stages onwards, which pointed to a more prominent involvement of SHH in PD limb axis development. In particular, retinoic acid (RA) target genes were upregulated proximally, while {{the expression of the}} RA-inactivating Cyp 26 b 1 enzyme was downregulated distally, pointing to increased RA activity in Shh-deficient mouse limb buds. Further genetic and molecular analysis established that Cyp 26 b 1 expression is regulated by AER-FGF signalling. During initiation of limb bud outgrowth, the activation of Cyp 26 b 1 expression creates a distal ‘RA-free’ domain, as indicated by complementary downregulation of a transcriptional sensor of RA activity. Subsequently, Cyp 26 b 1 expression increases as a consequence of SHH-dependent upregulation of AER-FGF signalling. To better understand the underlying signalling interactions, computational simulations of the spatiotemporal expression patterns and interactions were generated. These simulations predicted the existence of an antagonistic AER-FGF/CYP 26 B 1 /RA <b>signalling</b> <b>module,</b> which was verified experimentally. In summary, SHH promotes distal progression of limb development by enhancing CYP 26 B 1 -mediated RA clearance as part of a signalling network linking the SHH/GREM 1 /AER-FGF feedback loop to the newly identified AER-FGF/CYP 26 B 1 /RA module...|$|E

Based on evidence that mitochondria are key mediators of the cardioprotective signal, we hypothesized that PKC � and MAPKs interact, and that they form functional <b>signaling</b> <b>modules</b> in mitochondria during cardioprotection. Both immunoblotting and immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that PKC�, ERKs, JNKs, and p 38 MAPK co-localized with cardiac mitochondria. Moreover, transgenic {{activation of}} PKC � greatly increased mitochondrial PKC � expression and activity, which was concomitant with increased mitochondrial interaction of PKC � with ERKs, JNKs, and p 38 as determined by co-immunoprecipitation. These complex formations appeared to be independent of PKC � activity, as the interactions were also observed in mice expressing inactive PKC�. However, although both active and inactive PKC � bound to all three MAPKs, increased phosphorylation of mitochondrial ERKs was only observed in mice expressing active PKC � but not in mice expressing inactive PKC�. Examination of potential downstream targets of mitochondrial PKC�-ERK <b>signaling</b> <b>modules</b> revealed that phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bad was elevated in mitochondria.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this tone remain unknown. Here, we show that deletion of myosin light-chain kinases (MLCK) in the smooth muscle cells from internal anal sphincter (IAS-SMCs) abolishes basal tone, impairing defecation. Pharmacological regulation of ryanodine receptors (RyRs), L-type voltage-dependent Ca(2 +) channels (VDCCs) or TMEM 16 A Ca(2 +) -activated Cl(-) channels significantly changes global cytosolic Ca(2 +) concentration ([Ca(2 +) ]i) and the tone. TMEM 16 A deletion in IAS-SMCs abolishes the effects of modulators for TMEM 16 A or VDCCs on a RyR-mediated rise in global [Ca(2 +) ]i and impairs the tone and defecation. Hence, MLCK activation in IAS-SMCs caused by a global rise in [Ca(2 +) ]i via a RyR-TMEM 16 A-VDCC <b>signalling</b> <b>module</b> sets the basal tone.

Since signalling pathways involve {{several types of}} molecular interactions including protein-protein interactions, we postulated that investigating their organization {{in the context of}} the global protein-protein interaction network could provide a new integrated view of signalling mechanisms. Results Using a graph-theory based method to analyse the fly protein-protein interaction network, we found that each signalling pathway is organized in two to three different <b>signalling</b> <b>modules.</b> These modules contain canonical proteins of the signalling pathways, known regulators as well as other proteins thereby predicted to participate to the signalling mechanisms.

Because assembly of other membrane proteins requires specific interactions along extended stretches of transmembrane helices, we examined how transmembrane sequences flanking the polar interaction site contribute to assembly for three receptors that associate with different signaling modules-the natural killer cell receptors KIR and NKG 2 D and the Fc receptor for IgA, FcalphaRI. The KIR and NKG 2 D receptors assembled with the DAP 12 and DAP 10 dimers, respectively, even when the entire KIR or NKG 2 D transmembrane domains were replaced by polyleucine sequences with a properly positioned basic residue. In contrast, a high degree of specificity for the basic side chain could be observed because the KIR-DAP 12 and FcalphaRI-Fcgamma interactions favored lysine or arginine, respectively. Steric hindrance among incompatible extra-membranous domains and competition for <b>signaling</b> <b>modules</b> also contributed to specificity of assembly.

Our data show that the two proteins interact and that ZONAB activity is Rho-dependent. Overexpression of GEF-H 1 induces accumulation of ZONAB in the nucleus and activates transcription. Microtubule-affinity regulating kinase/partition-defective- 1, another type of GEF-H 1 -associated signalling protein, remains in the cytoplasm and partially co-localizes with the exchange factor.

Repression of E-cadherin expression by the transcription factor Snail is a central event during the loss of epithelial phenotype. Akt kinase activation is frequent in human carcinomas, and Akt regulates various cellular mechanisms including EMT.

40|$|Transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) principally relays {{its effects}} through the Smad pathway however, accumulating {{evidence}} indicate that alternative signaling routes are also employed by this pleiotropic cytokine. For instance recently, we {{have demonstrated that}} ligand occupied TGF-b receptors can directly trigger the TRAF 6 -TAK 1 <b>signaling</b> <b>module,</b> resulting in MAP kinase activation. Here we report identification of the adaptor molecule T TRAP as a novel component of this noncanonical TGF-b pathway. We show that the protein associates with TGF-b receptors and components of the TRAF 6 -TAK 1 <b>signaling</b> <b>module,</b> resulting in differential regulation of TGF-b activated p 38 and NF-kB responses. Modulation of cellular TTRAP level affects cell viability {{in the presence of}} TGF-b, suggesting that the protein is {{an important component of the}} TGF-b induced apoptotic process...|$|R

A maximum of 63 TFMs may be {{addressed}} by one SSI interlocking; in practice the number will be limited by timing issues and the need to allow for future expansion.|$|R
