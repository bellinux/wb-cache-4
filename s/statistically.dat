5|$|Cincinnati's ground {{offense was}} less <b>statistically</b> {{significant}} than its passing offense. It {{was led by}} running back Jacob Ramsey, who carried the ball 148times for 630yards and twotouchdowns. Backup running back John Goebel had 124 rushing attempts for 581yards and 7touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut {{dominated}} Buffalo <b>statistically</b> in {{the first}} half, gaining 225yards to the Bulls' 94, led by Donald Brown's 208yardsrushing. Buffalo won the turnover battle however, recovering five UConn fumbles. The Bulls scored 20points off UConn turnovers {{in the first}} half, but were held scoreless {{in the second half}} when the Huskies stopped turning the ball over.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being more}} highly {{promoted}} in pregame media coverage, Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick was outperformed <b>statistically</b> by Louisville's Hunter Cantwell. Vick completed 11 of 21passes for 203yards and two touchdowns. He also ran for 10yards on 13carries. Cantwell, meanwhile, completed 15 of his 37passes for 216yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions.|$|E

5|$|Federer's 2017 season {{marked a}} return to {{excellence}} for him. He had the most number of grand slams since 2009, most career titles since 2007, and highest win percentage since 2006. <b>Statistically,</b> this season was his career best since 2007.|$|E
5|$|Following the season, deGrom {{received}} a Wilson Defensive Player of the Year Award {{as the best}} defensive player <b>statistically</b> at his position in Major League Baseball. He also placed seventh in Cy Young Award voting.|$|E
5|$|Mura {{also has}} support during their matches from their ultras group, named the Black Gringos. <b>Statistically,</b> both teams always enjoyed {{one of the}} biggest attendances on their matches and, in term of numbers, both teams had one of the largest fan bases in the country. The fact that Prekmurje is one of the {{smallest}} and least populated regions in Slovenia has made Mura's fans labeled, by the general public, {{as one of the most}} loyal in the country. <b>Statistically,</b> Maribor is the more successful club, considering either the case of matches from the period from 1967 to 2005, or the whole period from 1967 to present day.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1954, the Sun Bowl did not award most {{valuable}} player honors, but Harold Johnson from Cincinnati was <b>statistically</b> the game's {{most valuable}} player, intercepting two Virginia Tech passes (one in the end zone) and scoring the first touchdown of the game on a 13-yard run.|$|E
5|$|Raonic {{is often}} {{compared}} to Isner and Karlović. The trio possess <b>statistically</b> dominant serves, leading the ATP in service games won and in aces per match {{in the period}} between 2012 and 2015. They have played each other infrequently, however. Raonic is 1–1 against Karlović and 1–3 against Isner. Karlović holds a 3–2 head-to-head advantage over Isner.|$|E
5|$|Stanford's {{running game}} was led <b>statistically</b> by sophomore running back Stepfan Taylor, who {{garnered}} 1,023rushingyards and 15touchdowns {{during the regular}} season.

5|$|<b>Statistically</b> {{the most}} {{successful}} manager was Alex McLeish, who won seven of the ten games during his tenure. Discounting managers who took charge of less than ten games, the least successful manager was George Burley, with just three wins in 14 games.|$|E
5|$|<b>Statistically,</b> Dražan Jerković and Vlatko Marković are {{the most}} {{successful}} managers in Croatia's history; they both recorded victories in each of their few games in charge.

5|$|Suicidal {{thoughts}} and behaviors are rare in clinical trials, and the FDA requires all antidepressants, including bupropion, {{to carry a}} boxed warning stating that antidepressants may {{increase the risk of}} suicide in persons younger than 25. This warning is based on a statistical analysis conducted by the FDA which found a 2-fold increase in suicidal thought and behavior in children and adolescents, and 1.5-fold increase in the 18–24 age group. For this analysis the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants in order to obtain <b>statistically</b> significant results. Considered in isolation, bupropion was not <b>statistically</b> different from placebo.|$|E
5|$|Survey research: The {{researcher}} gathers data using interviews, questionnaires, {{or similar}} feedback from {{a set of}} people sampled from a particular population of interest. Survey items from an interview or questionnaire may be open-ended or closed-ended. Data from surveys is usually analysed <b>statistically</b> on a computer.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to his {{performance}} in leading Florida State to the win, FSU quarterback Drew Weatherford was named the game's Most Valuable Player. Weatherford finished the game having completed 21of his 35passes for 225yards and onetouchdown. Weatherford would eventually finish the season with 3,180passing yards, the most ever recorded by a freshman quarterback in the ACC. On {{the opposite side of}} the ball, Virginia Tech quarterback Marcus Vick finished the game 26for 52with 335yards, oneinterception, and onetouchdown. Although Vick was slightly better <b>statistically</b> than Weatherford and the Hokies were more <b>statistically</b> successful on offense thanks to Vick, the Most Valuable Player award is not usually given to a player on the losing team.|$|E

25|$|ACE inhibitors were {{associated}} with a <b>statistically</b> significant 10% mortality reduction: (HR 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84–0.97; P=0.004). In contrast, no significant mortality reduction was observed with ARB treatment (HR 0.99; 95% CI, 0.94–1.04; P=0.683). Analysis of mortality reduction by different ACE inhibitors showed that perindopril-based regimens {{are associated with a}} <b>statistically</b> significant 13% all-cause mortality reduction.|$|E

25|$|Several {{very large}} {{observational}} {{studies have also}} found elevated {{risk of heart attack}} from rofecoxib. For example, a recent retrospective study of 113,000 elderly Canadians suggested a borderline <b>statistically</b> significant increased relative risk of heart attacks of 1.24 from Vioxx usage, with a relative risk of 1.73 for higher-dose Vioxx usage. (Levesque, 2005). Another study, using Kaiser Permanente data, found a 1.47 relative risk for low-dose Vioxx usage and 3.58 for high-dose Vioxx usage compared to current use of celecoxib, though the smaller number was not <b>statistically</b> significant, and relative risk compared to other populations was not <b>statistically</b> significant.
