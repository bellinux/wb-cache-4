40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{review the}} incidence, risk factors, and {{treatment}} options of intraoperative and postoperative complications of <b>stone</b> <b>basketing</b> in urology {{with emphasis on}} certain principles that must be upheld to prevent those complications. METHODS: A literature search was performed using the MEDLINE database on <b>stone</b> <b>basketing</b> between 1970 and 2005. RESULTS: Iatrogenic trauma due to retrieval of a stone is well known but the exact incidence is difficult to ascertain. Rarely, <b>stone</b> <b>basketing</b> can cause major trauma to the ureter, such as avulsion or intussusception, requiring open or laparoscopic intervention for ureteral continuity restoration. Mucosal abrasion, ureteral perforation, and stricture formation have also been described as complications of <b>stone</b> <b>basketing.</b> Occasionally, the engaged or broken basket can provoke anxiety even for experienced urologists. Factors that {{increase the risk of}} complications, strategies for repair, and techniques for prevention are discussed extensively. CONCLUSION: Infrequent, surgical misadventures during <b>stone</b> <b>basketing</b> can occur and must be treated appropriately. Careful attention to instrument selection and surgical techniques and awareness of risk factors and type and site of potential injury are essential to reduce these complication...|$|R

40|$|Two-dimensional {{finite element}} thermal {{simulations}} of a generic rail package designed to transport twenty-one spent PWR assemblies were performed for normal transport conditions. Effective thermal conductivity models were employed within the fuel assembly/backfill gas region. Those conductivity models {{were developed by}} other investigators assuming the <b>basket</b> <b>wall</b> temperature is uniform. They are typically used to predict the maximum fuel cladding temperature near the package center. The cladding temperature must not exceed specified limits during normal transport. This condition limits the number and heat generation rate of fuel assembles that can transported. The current work shows the support <b>basket</b> <b>wall</b> temperatures in {{the periphery of the}} package are highly non-uniform. Moreover the thermal resistance of those regions significantly affects the maximum fuel clad temperature near the package center. This brings the validity of the fuel/backfill gas thermal conductivity models into question. The non-uniform <b>basket</b> <b>wall</b> temperature profiles quantified in this work will be used in future numerical and experimental studies to develop new thermal models of the fuel assembly/backfill gas regions. This will be an iterative process, since the assembly/backfill model affects the predicted <b>basket</b> <b>wall</b> temperature profiles...|$|R
40|$|Background. In some cases, the {{ureteral}} {{stone is}} simultaneously stabilized by a <b>stone</b> <b>basket</b> when endourologic lithotripsy is performed. This stabilization {{can be either}} on purpose or by accident. By accident means that an impaction in the ureter occurs by an extraction of a <b>stone</b> with a <b>basket.</b> A stabilization on purpose means to avoid a retropulsion of the stone into the kidney during lithotripsy. At {{this part of the}} operation, <b>stone</b> <b>baskets</b> have been frequently damaged. This severing of wires can lead to ureteral trauma because of hook formation. Material and Methods. In a laboratory setting, the time and the pulse numbers were measured until breaking the wires from four different nitinol <b>stone</b> <b>baskets</b> by using five different lithotripsy devices. The endpoint was gross visibledamage to the wire and loss of electric conduction. Results. The Ho:YAG laser and the ultrasonic device were able to destroy almost all the wires. The ballistic devices and the electrohydraulic device were able to destroy thin wires. Conclusion. The operating surgeon should know the risk of damagefor every lithotripter. The Ho:YAG-laser and the ultrasonic device should be classified as dangerous for the basket wire with all adverse effects to the patient...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{experimentally}} {{evaluate the}} efficacy of a standard sterilization protocol employed during reuse of disposable helical <b>stone</b> <b>baskets.</b> Methods: Study performed on 20 helical stone baskets: 10 {{were used in the}} initial validation process, contaminated with Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and imprinted on Müeller-Hinton media; 10 catheters were contaminated with Geobacillus stearothermophilus ATCC 7953, processed, inoculated in TSB and incubated in a water bath at a temperature of 55 ºC. Bacterial growth was evaluated after 1, 3, 5 and 7 days. After sterilization, <b>stone</b> <b>baskets</b> were also opened and closed 40 times to check for functional problems. All plastic and basket parts were carefully checked for damages. Results: After the 72 -hour incubation period, there was growth of E. coli ATCC 25922 in 100 % of imprints. After the sterilization process and up to 7 days incubation period on a blood agar plate, there was no growth of G. stearothermophilus ATCC 7953 or any other bacteria. There were no functional problems or damage to baskets after the sterilization process. Conclusion: The ethylene oxide system is efficacious and safe for sterilization of disposable helical <b>stone</b> <b>baskets.</b> However, further clinical studies are required and should provide more safety information...|$|R

40|$|Department of Nuclear EngineeringA {{spent fuel}} cask must be {{designed}} to provide safety functions. In particular, {{in order to maintain}} the sub-criticality safety, different neutron absorbers have been used for the spent nuclear fuel management system. Although BORAL is the most used neutron absorber, several problems have been reported and it has some potential problems for long term storage of spent nuclear fuels. Recently, a Gd-alloyed duplex stainless steel demonstrated the possibility of fabrication and under development for an advanced neutron absorber and structural material as well. In this study, the effect of Gd alloyed neutron absorber on thermal performance of a spent fuel cask has been studied. The thermal properties of Gd-alloyed DSS was measured using the specimens provided by KITEC. The effect of Gd-alloyed duplex stainless steel adoption was analyzed for the reference casks, KSC- 1 and KORAD- 21. The analysis method was verified by comparing the analysis results with the reported values. Their system with Gd-alloyed DSS should remove decay heat with passive cooling. The KSC- 1 and KORAD- 21 casks were modeled with a 2 D axis-symmetry condition and 3 D symmetry condition, respectively, using ANSYS FLUENT v 17. 0. Based on the verified method, thermal performance of KORAD- 21 which adopts Gd-alloyed DSS was analyzed. The maximum fuel cladding temperature with Gd-alloyed DSS exceeded allowable temperature of 400 ℃ and it could affect the fuel integrity. Therefore, <b>basket</b> <b>wall</b> thickness and disk thickness were optimized to enhance thermal performance. When the <b>basket</b> <b>wall</b> thickness was reduced, the gap between the basket surface and disk square holes was consequently increased. The increased gap enhanced the upward flow of helium and it improved the decay heat removal. Additionally, disk thickness was optimized to 60 mm from 20 mm. The increased heat-conducting surface enhanced the conduction heat transfer. As a result, UNIST-version design of the KORAD- 21 cask was developed with the 5. 0 mm <b>basket</b> <b>wall</b> thickness and 60 mm disk thickness. Thermal performance of UNIST design cask satisfied thermal requirements in normal operation. clos...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{assessed}} {{the efficacy of}} {{extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy}} (ESWL, Dornier Medical Systems, Inc., Marietta, Georgia) for distal ureteral calculi with the HM 3 (Dornier Medical Systems, Inc.) lithotriptor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 585 consecutive patients with distal ureteral calculi were treated with ESWL using an unmodified HM 3 lithotriptor. Of these patients 67 referred for treatment only for whom no followup was available were excluded from further analysis. The remaining 518 cases were followed until they were radiologically documented to be stone-free or considered treatment failures. Before ESWL additional procedures were performed in 144 patients, including stone push back, ureteral catheter or Double-J (Medical Engineering Corp., New York, New York) stent placement, percutaneous nephrostomy, ureteral endoscopic maneuvers or <b>stone</b> <b>basket</b> manipulation. A total of 374 patients needed no preliminary treatment before ESWL. RESULTS: Of the 518 patients 469 (91 %) were successfully treated with 1 ESWL session, while 49 (9 %) needed 2 or 3. Manipulation after ESWL was performed in 22 cases, including stent placement, percutaneous nephrostomy, ureteral endoscopic stone removal and a <b>stone</b> <b>basket</b> procedure. On day 1 after ESWL 327 patients (63 %) were stone-free, 158 (30 %) had less than 5 mm. fragments and 33 (7 %) had more than 5 mm. fragments. At 3 months the stone-free rate increased to 97 %. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that ESWL for distal ureteral calculi with the powerful unmodified HM 3 lithotriptor has a high success rate with a low rate of minimally traumatic manipulations before and after intervention.

Our laboratory is studying the Thulium fiber laser (λ = 1908 nm) as an alternative lithotripter. The TFL has several advantages, including lower stone ablation thresholds, use with smaller and more flexible fibers, and operation at arbitrary pulse lengths and pulse rates.

40|$|Introduction: The {{occurrence}} of urolithiasis in pregnancy represents {{a challenge in}} both {{diagnosis and treatment of}} this condition, because it presents risks not only to the mother but also to the fetus. Surgical treatment may be indicated for patients with infection, persistent pain, and obstruction of a solitary kidney. We present our experience on the management of pregnant patients with ureteral calculi and a review of the literature. Materials and Methods: The charts of 19 pregnant patients with obstructive ureteral calculi were retrospectively reviewed. Gestational age ranged from 13 to 33 weeks. In all patients, ureteral stone was diagnosed on abdominal ultrasound. In regard to localization, 15 calculi were in the distal ureter, 3 in the proximal ureter, and 1 in the interior of an ureterocele. Calculi size ranged from 6 to 10 mm (mean, 8 mm). The following criteria were used to indicate ureteroscopy: persistent pain with no improvement after clinical treatment, increase in renal dilation, or presence of uterine contractions. Nine patients (47. 3 %) were submitted to ureteroscopy. All calculi (100 %) were removed with a <b>stone</b> <b>basket</b> extractor under continuous endoscopic vision. None of the calculi demanded the use of a lithotriptor. Results: Nine patients (47. 3 %) treated with clinical measurements presented no obstetric complications and spontaneous elimination of the calculi. Nine patients (47. 3 %) submitted to ureteroscopy had no surgical complications. There was remission of pain in all cases after ureteroscopy and ureteral catheter placement. Conclusion: The diagnosis and treatment of ureteral lithiasis in pregnant women present potential risks for the fetus and the mother. Conservative management is the first option, but ureteroscopy may be performed with safety and high success rates...|$|R
