5|$|The greater yellow-headed vulture {{feeds on}} carrion and locates {{carcasses}} by <b>sight</b> <b>and</b> by smell, an ability which {{is rare in}} birds.

Like other New World vultures, the greater yellow-headed vulture utilizes thermals to stay aloft with minimal effort. It lays its eggs on flat surfaces, such as the floors of caves, or in the hollows of stumps. It feeds its young by regurgitation.|$|E

5|$|The rifle had {{normally}} {{been used}} to shoot rabbits with the silencer and telescopic sight attached. The court heard that the telescopic sight {{had to be removed}} with a screwdriver, but it was usually left in place because it was time-consuming to realign it.

5|$|A {{helmet-mounted sight}} (HMS) {{developed}} by Luoyang Electro-Optics Technology Development Centre of AVIC {{was developed in}} parallel with the JF-17; it was first tested on Prototype 04 in 2006. It was dubbed as EO HMS, (Electro-Optical Helmet Mounted <b>Sight)</b> <b>and</b> was first revealed {{to the public in}} 2008 at the 7th Zhuhai Airshow, where a partial mock-up was on display. The HMS tracks the pilot's head and eye movements to guide missiles towards the pilot's visual target. An externally carried day/night laser designator targeting pod may be integrated with the avionics to guide laser-guided bombs (LGBs). An extra hardpoint may be added under the starboard air intake, opposite the cannon, for such pods. To reduce the numbers of targeting pods required, the aircraft's tactical data link can transmit target data to other aircraft not equipped with targeting pods. The communication systems comprise two VHF/UHF radios; the VHF radio has the capacity for data linking for communication with ground control centres, airborne early warning and control aircraft and combat aircraft with compatible data links for network-centric warfare, and improved situation awareness.|$|E
5|$|After Marwan's 732 expedition, {{a period}} of quiet set in. Marwan was {{replaced}} as governor of Armenia and Adharbayjan in spring 733 by Sa'id al-Harashi, but he undertook no campaigns at all until 735, when he lost his <b>sight</b> <b>and</b> resigned. Marwan was then re-appointed to the post, but he too was unable to launch anything but local expeditions until 737: three fortresses near the Darial Pass and the ruler of a North Caucasian principality, Tuman Shah, were captured in 735, while another local prince, Wartanis, was defeated and killed in 736. Blankinship attributes this inactivity to the exhaustion of the Arab armies and draws a parallel with the contemporaneous quiet phase in Transoxiana in 732–734, where the Arabs had also suffered a series of costly defeats {{at the hands of}} Turkic nomads. In addition, Agapius and Michael the Syrian record that the Arabs and the Khazars concluded peace, information which Muslim sources ignore or downplay to a tactical ruse by Marwan designed to gain time for his preparations.|$|E
