Self-consciousness over her figure, along with the anxiety <b>she</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel,</b> caused her to lash out emotionally, abuse diet pills, and briefly lose control over her life. The character's physical appearance is shown to {{play a part in}} her development. At various points of the series, she won the title of Spring Princess at a dance, and was voted her school's most beautiful girl. Kelly is aware of her appeal, but not to the point of conceit; instead, she is sometimes shown to be troubled by it. At one point, she entered a phase where she felt that no one took her seriously, which was heightened when Dylan gave his manuscript to Andrea for review instead of to her. During this time, <b>she</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>feel</b> that people only liked her because she was physically attractive.|$|E

The couple married, despite a rumoured objection by Anggun's family, reportedly because they felt Anggun was too young [...] Georgea later became Anggun's manager.

[...] Jolson's [...] "Wait a minute" [...] line prompted a loud, positive response from the audience, who were dumbfounded by seeing, hearing, someone speak on a film for the first time.

Excitement built, and when Jolson and Eugenie Besserer began their dialogue scene, [...] "the audience became hysterical." [...] After the show, the audience turned into a [...] "milling, battling, mob", in one journalist's description, chanting [...] "Jolson, Jolson, Jolson!" [...] Among those who reviewed the film, the critic who foresaw most clearly what it presaged for the future of cinema was Life magazine's Robert E. Sherwood. He described the spoken dialogue scene between Jolson and Besserer as [...] "fraught with tremendous significance....

2500|$|By 1980 Cold Chisel was {{the biggest}} band in Australia and Barnes had {{developed}} a notorious reputation as a hard-drinking wild man who reportedly drank more than two bottles of vodka a day, much of it onstage during performances. While in Canberra in November 1979 however, he met Jane Mahoney (born 1958 as Jane Dejakasaya, Bangkok, Thailand), the stepdaughter of an Australian diplomat.

She studied art history and theater at the University of Vienna.
