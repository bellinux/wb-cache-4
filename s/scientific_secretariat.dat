40|$|Freshwater {{and marine}} {{ecosystems}} {{continue to be}} the focus of significant environmental change associated with an expanding human population and a rapidly changing climate. Many organisms within these environments, and fish in particular, are susceptible to increasing pressures, ranging from exploitation to modifications and loss of habitat. In order to manage and conserve these populations and protect biodiversity, these resources must be managed in a sympathetic and responsible manner. One biological tool that is progressively {{at the cutting edge of}} aquatic conservation is telemetry, which is increasingly being used by scientists to investigate fundamental aspects of animal biology in order to conserve and manage natural resources. The Sixth Conference on Fish Telemetry held in Europe was organised by the University of Evora and the Institute of Oceanography of the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon in June 2005. The Conference attracted 162 delegates from 25 countries stimulating a multidisciplinary approach to problem solving and further promoting technological development and innovation in the field of wildlife telemetry. The Conference provided an excellent forum for scientists and engineers to exchange views and to disseminate information on recent developments in order to support and provide the scientific basis for the sustainable management of aquatic resources. At the conference 74 oral and 56 poster contributions presented, and after review by members of the editorial board, 26 manuscripts were selected for inclusion within these proceedings. The selected papers are organised into four sections: (1) Human Impacts and Fisheries; (2) Migration and Behaviour; (3) Species Conservation and Habitat Rehabilitation; (4) Methodology and New Technology.

The Euradwaste 2013 intends to bring together researchers, radioactive waste management organisations, policy-makers, regulators, engineers and educators to discuss the underground disposal of spent nuclear fuel and long-lived high-level radioactive waste as well as the impact of advanced fuel cycles on deep geological repositories. Presentations, poster sessions, panel discussions and question and- answer sessions focused on the full spectrum of issues facing implementation of waste management option are taking places. Objectives, policy relevance and content of workshop The Euradwaste 2013 will take place in Lithuania and be organised within the frame of the Lithuanian Presidency.

40|$|Acute {{appendicitis}} (AA) {{is among}} {{the most common cause of}} acute abdominal pain. Diagnosis of AA is challenging; a variable combination of clinical signs and symptoms has been used together with laboratory findings in several scoring systems proposed for suggesting the probability of AA and the possible subsequent management pathway. The role of imaging in the diagnosis of AA is still debated, with variable use of US, CT and MRI in different settings worldwide. Up to date, comprehensive clinical guidelines for diagnosis and management of AA have never been issued. In July 2015, during the 3 rd World Congress of the WSES, held in Jerusalem (Israel), a panel of experts including an Organizational Committee and Scientific Committee and <b>Scientific</b> <b>Secretariat,</b> participated to a Consensus Conference where eight panelists presented a number of statements developed for each of the eight main questions about diagnosis and management of AA. The statements were then voted, eventually modified and finally approved by the participants to The Consensus Conference and lately by the board of co-authors. The current paper is reporting the definitive Guidelines Statements on each of the following topics: 1) Diagnostic efficiency of clinical scoring systems, 2) Role of Imaging, 3) Non-operative treatment for uncomplicated appendicitis, 4) Timing of appendectomy and in-hospital delay, 5) Surgical treatment 6) Scoring systems for intra-operative grading of appendicitis and their clinical usefulness 7) Non-surgical treatment for complicated appendicitis: abscess or phlegmon 8) Pre-operative and post-operative antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) {{lobectomy}} {{has been}} gradually accepted {{as an alternative}} surgical approach to open thoracotomy for selected patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) over the past 20 years. The aim of this project was to standardize the perioperative management of VATS lobectomy patients through expert consensus and to provide insightful guidance to clinical practice. METHODS: A panel of 55 experts on VATS lobectomy was identified by the <b>Scientific</b> <b>Secretariat</b> and the International Scientific Committee of the ' 20 th Anniversary of VATS Lobectomy Conference-The Consensus Meeting'. The Delphi methodology consisting of two rounds of voting was implemented to facilitate the development of consensus. Results from the second-round voting {{formed the basis of}} the current Consensus Statement. Consensus was defined a priori as more than 50 % agreement among the panel of experts. Clinical practice was deemed 'recommended' if 50 - 74 % of the experts reached agreement and 'highly recommended' if 75 % or more of the experts reached agreement. RESULTS: Fifty VATS lobectomy experts (91 %) from 16 countries completed both rounds of standardized questionnaires. No statistically significant differences in the responses between the two rounds of questioning were identified. Consensus was reached on 21 controversial points, outlining the current accepted definition of VATS lobectomy, its indications and contraindications, perioperative clinical management and recommendations for training and future research directions. CONCLUSION: The present Consensus Statement represents a collective agreement among 50 international experts to establish a standardized practice of VATS lobectomy for the thoracic surgical community after 20 years of clinical experience. 7 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present briefly the {{projects}} called FONESYS (Forum & Network of System Thermal-Hydraulics Codes in Nuclear Reactor Thermal-Hydraulics) and SILENCE (Significant Light and Heavy Water Reactor Thermal Hydraulic Experiments Network for the Consistent Exploitation of the Data), their participants, their motivations, their main targets and working modalities. System Thermal-Hydraulics (SYS-TH) codes, also as part of the Best Estimate Plus Uncertainty (BEPU) approaches, are expected to achieve a more-and-more relevant role in nuclear reactor safety and design technology. Namely, the number of code-users is likely to increase in the countries where nuclear technology is exploited. Thus, the idea of establishing a forum and a network among the code developers and with possible extension to code users has started to have major importance and value. In this framework, the FONESYS initiative has been launched in 2010 aiming at creation of a common ground for discussing current limitations and envisaged improvements in various areas of SYS-TH and their application in the licensing process and safety analysis. According to FONESYS statute, there are seven signatory Institutions and two observer Institutions currently participating in the project. Signatory Institutions are AREVA-NP, Commissariat à l’Énergie Atomique et aux Énergies Alternatives (CEA), San Piero a Grado Nuclear Research Group - University of Pisa (GRNSPG-UNIPI), Gesellschaft für Anlagenund Reaktorsicherheit (GRS), Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI), Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety (KINS), and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. SILENCE is a network that intends to promote the cooperation among teams of experimentalists managing or involved in significant experimental projects in nuclear reactor thermal-hydraulics, with the aim to contrast the risk of losing expertise and vision in this important area of the nuclear technology. This network was launched in 2012, replicating for the TH experimental domain the role that FONESYS plays in the code-development domain. Currently, the following Organizations are Members of SILENCE: AREVA GmbH, Helmholtz Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR), Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI), Hungarian Academy of Sciences Centre for Energy Research (MTA EK),Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT), and Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). SILENCE is currently organizing a “Specialists Workshop on Advanced Instrumentation and Measurement Techniques for Nuclear Reactor Thermal Hydraulics” (SWINTH- 2016). The San Piero a Grado Nuclear Research Group - University of Pisa (GRNSPG-UNIPI) is the Host Institution and plays as a <b>Scientific</b> <b>Secretariat</b> for both Networks...|$|E
