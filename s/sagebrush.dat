5|$|<b>Sagebrush</b> {{typically}} dominates drier, non-forested {{areas at}} lower elevations. Species that commonly occur with <b>sagebrush</b> include Sandberg bluegrass, wild onion, milk vetches, bluebunch wheatgrass, bitterbrush, gray horsebrush, green rabbitbrush, and others. In riparian areas below , trees such as black cottonwood, narrowleaf cottonwood, thinleaf alder, water birch, and mountain maple grow with shrubs including chokeberry and willows. Riparian areas in largely treeless habitats such as <b>sagebrush</b> steppe primarily consist of willows along with thinleaf alder, chokecherry, mountain maple, shrubby cinquefoil, fireweed, saxifrage, and grasses.|$|E
5|$|Drought {{tolerance}} by physiological adaptations such as {{the ability}} to survive extreme dehydration or the ability to extract water from very dry soil. <b>Sagebrush</b> and antelope bitterbrush are examples.|$|E
5|$|The long-toed {{salamander}} is an ecologically versatile species {{living in a}} variety of habitats, ranging from temperate rainforests, coniferous forests, montane riparian, <b>sagebrush</b> plains, red fir forest, semiarid <b>sagebrush,</b> cheatgrass plains, to alpine meadows along the rocky shores of mountain lakes. Adults can be located in forested understory, hiding under coarse woody debris, rocks, and in small mammal burrows. During the spring breeding season, adults can be found under debris or in the shoreline shallows of rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds. Ephemeral waters are often frequented.|$|E
5|$|Analyzing {{the pollen}} {{sequences}} {{at the site}} showed a steppe ecosystem immediately following the retreat of glaciers 13,000 years ago, which {{gave way to a}} mixed forest of pine and spruce, which led into the current <b>sagebrush</b> prairie ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Desert {{conditions}} persist on canyon bottoms {{and rocky}} ledges away from perennial streams. <b>Sagebrush,</b> prickly pear cactus, and rabbitbrush, along with sacred datura and Indian paintbrush, are common. Utah penstemon and golden aster {{can also be}} found. Milkvetch and prince's plume are found in pockets of selenium-rich soils.|$|E
5|$|Limited {{by their}} need for water, trees such as willows, alders, and ponderosa pines are found only near the monument's streams or springs. Serviceberry bushes and shrubs like {{mountain}} mahogany are found in places where moisture collects near rock slides and ledges. Elsewhere long-rooted rabbitbrush has adapted to survive in dry areas. Other shrubs with adaptive properties include greasewood, <b>sagebrush,</b> shadscale, broom snakeweed, antelope bitterbrush, and purple sage. Western junipers, which have extensive root systems, thrive in the dry climate; {{in the absence of}} periodic fires they tend to displace grasses and <b>sagebrush</b> and to create relatively barren landscapes. The Park Service is considering controlled burning to limit the junipers and to create open areas for bunchgrasses that re-sprout from their roots after a fire.|$|E
5|$|Navajo textile artist Nonabah Gorman Bryan {{developed}} a two-step process for creating green dye. First the Churro wool yarn is dyed yellow with <b>sagebrush,</b> Artemisia tridentata, {{and then it}} is soaked in black dye afterbath. Red onion skins are also used by Navajo dyers to produce green.|$|E
5|$|The Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park {{contains}} {{a wide variety}} of flora and fauna. Some common plants native to the park include aspen, Ponderosa pine, <b>sagebrush,</b> desert mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius), Utah juniper, gambel oak (scrub oak) and single-leaf ash. The Black Canyon gilia (Aliciella penstemonoides) is a species of wildflower native to the park.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} the high desert {{provides}} habitat for mammals such as pronghorn, coyote, mule deer, black-tailed jackrabbit, and cougar. Birds common in the region include sage grouse, California quail, and prairie falcon. The western juniper {{is the most common}} tree in the region, and big <b>sagebrush</b> and common woolly sunflower are the region's most widespread plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{headwaters}} of the Snake River and the high mountains elsewhere in the watershed were historically heavily forested. These include aspen, Douglas fir, and spruce fir, comprising about 20% of the historic watershed. At the base of mountains and in the Lost River basin, <b>sagebrush</b> was and is the predominant vegetation cover. Because of deforestation, up to {{one quarter of the}} forests have been taken over by <b>sagebrush,</b> leaving the remaining forests to cover about 15% of the watershed. However, the lodgepole pine has increased in number, taking over historic stands of other conifers. There are also up to 118 species of rare or endemic plants that occur in the Snake River watershed.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} {{altitude}} in Grand Teton National Park impacts {{the types of}} plant species found at various elevations. In the alpine zone above the tree line, which in Grand Teton National Park is at approximately , tundra conditions prevail. In this treeless region, hundreds of species of grass, wildflower, moss and lichen are found. In the subalpine region from the tree line {{to the base of}} the mountains, whitebark pine, limber pine, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce are dominant. In the valley floor, lodgepole pine is most common but Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, and blue spruce inhabit drier areas, while aspen, cottonwood, alder, and willow are more commonly found around lakes, streams and wetlands. However, the tablelands above the Snake River channel are mostly <b>sagebrush</b> plains and in terms of acreage is the most widespread habitat in the park. The <b>sagebrush</b> plains or flats have 100 species of grasses and wildflowers. Slightly more elevated sections of the plains of the northern sections of Jackson Hole form forest islands with one such obvious example being Timbered Island. In this ecotone, forested islands surrounded by <b>sagebrush</b> expanses provide shelter for various animal species during the day and nearby grasses for night time foraging.|$|E
5|$|Wildflowers, which bloom {{mainly in}} the spring and early summer, include pincushions, golden bee plant, dwarf purple monkey flower, and <b>sagebrush</b> {{mariposa}} lily at the Painted Hills Unit. Munro's globemallow, lupines, yellow fritillary, hedgehog cactus, and Applegate's Indian paintbrush are commonly seen at the Clarno and Sheep Rock units.|$|E
5|$|Over 270 {{bird species}} have been {{observed}} in central Idaho, including 36 accidental species – {{those that are not}} normally found in the region but have been observed on at least one occasion. Golden eagles and greater sage-grouse can be found over <b>sagebrush</b> steppe, whereas bald eagles can be seen along rivers. The Forest Service has listed northern goshawks, flammulated owls, and white-headed woodpeckers as a sensitive species in the forest.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{plants in}} the park include more than 100 grass species, many native to the region. Growing among the grasses are flowering species such as evening primrose, mariposa lily, and blue flax, and shrubs such as <b>sagebrush,</b> saltbush, and rabbitbrush. Among {{the wide variety of}} grasses are native perennial bunchgrass, blue grama, sacaton, sideoats grama, bearded sprangletop, and bush muhly. Invasive species that crowd out slower-spreading natives include annual lovegrass and brome (cheat grass).|$|E
5|$|Vegetation in the {{watershed}} is {{closely tied to}} elevation and precipitation levels. About 30 percent of the basin, mostly at higher elevation levels, is populated with oak, aspen and coniferous trees. At the lower levels, 27 percent of the basin is rich in mountain-brush, <b>sagebrush,</b> juniper and grasses. About 34 percent of the Jordan River basin is classified as urban.|$|E
5|$|Chacoan flora typifies that of North American high deserts: <b>sagebrush</b> {{and several}} species of cactus are {{interspersed}} with dry scrub forests of piñon and juniper, the latter primarily on the mesa tops. The canyon is far drier than other parts of New Mexico located at similar latitudes and elevations, and it lacks the temperate coniferous forests plentiful to the east. The prevailing sparseness of plants and wildlife was echoed in ancient times, when overpopulation, expanding cultivation, overhunting, habitat destruction, and drought may have led the Chacoans to strip the canyon of wild plants and game. It {{has been suggested that}} even during wet periods the canyon was able to sustain only 2,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the surface}} of the Mono Craters is barren but its slopes are covered by Jeffrey pine forest and partial greenery. Pumice Valley, {{directly}} to the west, is covered by <b>sagebrush</b> scrubland. The soil consists primarily of deep pumice, which does not hold water well. Mycorrhizal fungi in the soil invade the roots of Jeffrey pine trees in a symbiotic relationship that helps the pine absorb water and provides nutrients to the fungi. Jeffrey pine forests also surround the Inyo Craters and Mammoth Mountain. Mule deer, coyotes, black bears, yellow-bellied marmots, raccoons and mountain lions all have ranges that are coincident with forests that cover parts of the Mono–Inyo craters.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the near}} {{extermination}} of wolves and cougars, the coyote was most numerous in grasslands inhabited by bison, pronghorn, elk, and other deer, doing particularly well in short-grass areas with prairie dogs, {{though it was}} just as much at home in semiarid areas with <b>sagebrush</b> and jackrabbits or in deserts inhabited by cactus, kangaroo rats, and rattlesnakes. As long as it was not in direct competition with the wolf, the coyote ranged from the Sonoran Desert to the alpine regions of adjoining mountains or the plains and mountainous areas of Alberta. With the extermination of the wolf, the coyote's range expanded to encompass broken forests from the tropics of Guatemala and the northern slope of Alaska.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{vegetation cover}} of coastal sage scrub typically goes through approximately 25-year cycles, with its peak biodiversity reached in roughly 10 {{years after the}} beginning of a new 25-year period. Such periods are typically separated by wildfires, which clear away dead or dying vegetation and leave bare ground for new growth. The canyon is one of the last remaining sanctuaries for many plants native to Southern California. Approximately one hundred species of plants, most native to California, are found in Laurel and Willow Canyons alone. These include monkey flower, goldenrod, and <b>sagebrush.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{people of the}} high desert region are the Northern Paiute people. These Native Americans were once semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who relied on nuts, roots, seeds, berries, and eggs, and animals such as deer, pronghorn, geese, quail, rabbits, and bear, following their food to high and low elevations depending {{on the time of}} year. They make sandals, traps, and fishing nets, and weave baskets. Made out of <b>sagebrush,</b> willow, tule plant, Indian hemp, and sumac fibers, the baskets are tight enough to carry water. Archaeological evidence from near Fort Rock has shown that people wove baskets in the area at least 9,000years ago.|$|E
5|$|Wildflowers bloom {{from early}} May to late September {{but most are}} gone by late August. Moisture from snow-melt along with some {{rainfall}} in late spring kick-starts the germination of annual plants, including wildflowers. Most of these plants complete their entire life cycle in the few months each year that moisture levels are good. The onset of summer decreases the number of wildflowers and by autumn only the tiny yellow flowers of <b>sagebrush</b> and rabbitbrush remain. Some wildflowers that grow {{in the area are}} the arrow-leaved balsamroot, bitterroot, blazingstar, desert parsley, dwarf monkeyflower, paintbrush, scorpionweed, scabland penstemon and the wild onion.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park and the {{surrounding}} region host over 1,000 species of vascular plants. With an altitude variance of over , the park {{has a number of}} different ecological zones including alpine tundra, the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone where spruce-fir forests are dominant, and the valley floor, where a mixed conifer and deciduous forest zone occupies regions with better soils intermixed with <b>sagebrush</b> plains atop alluvial deposits. Additionally, wetlands near some lakes and in the valley floor adjacent to rivers and streams cover large expanses, especially along the Snake River near Oxbow Bend near Moran and Willow Flats near the Jackson Lake Lodge. Altitude, available soils, wildfire incidence, avalanches and human activities have a direct impact on the types of plant species in an immediate area. Where these various niches overlap is known as an ecotone.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verdeans {{supplemented}} {{their diet}} by gathering {{the seeds and}} fruits of wild plants, searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources. Depending on the season, they collected piñon nuts and juniper berries, weedy goosefoot, pigweed, purslane, tomatillo, tansy mustard, globe mallow, sunflower seeds, and yucca, as well as various species of grass and cacti. Prickly pear fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar. Wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge. They used <b>sagebrush</b> and mountain mahogany, along with piñon and juniper, for firewood. They also smoked wild tobacco. Because the Ancestral Puebloans considered all material consumed and discarded by their communities as sacred, their midden piles were viewed with reverence. Starting during the Basketmaker III period, , Mesa Verdeans often buried their dead in these mounds.|$|E
5|$|Shoshone National Forest has {{virtually}} all the original animal and plant species that were there when white explorers such as John Colter and Jim Bridger first visited the region. The forest {{is home to the}} Grizzly bear, cougar, moose, tens of thousands of elk as well as the largest herd of bighorn sheep in the U.S. The streams in the forest are considered to have some of the best game species fishing opportunities in the U.S. including Yellowstone cutthroat trout. More than 1,300 miles of hiking trails, 32 campgrounds and adjacent forests and parklands provide numerous recreational opportunities. There are four wilderness areas within the forest, protecting {{more than half of the}} managed land area from development. From <b>sagebrush</b> plains through dense spruce and fir forest to craggy mountain peaks, Shoshone National Forest has a rich biodiversity rarely matched in any protected area.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Columbia's {{drainage}} basin (which, at , {{is about the}} size of France) lies roughly between the Rocky Mountains on the east and the Cascade Mountains on the west. In the United States and Canada the term watershed is often used to mean {{drainage basin}}. The term Columbia Basin is used to refer not only to the entire drainage basin but also to subsets of the river's full watershed, such as the relatively flat and unforested area in eastern Washington bounded by the Cascades, the Rocky Mountains, and the Blue Mountains. Within the watershed are diverse landforms including mountains, arid plateaus, river valleys, rolling uplands, and deep gorges. Grand Teton National Park lies in the watershed, as well as parts of Yellowstone National Park, Glacier National Park, Mount Rainier National Park, and North Cascades National Park. Canadian National Parks in the watershed include Kootenay National Park, Yoho National Park, Glacier National Park, and Mount Revelstoke National Park. Hells Canyon, the deepest gorge in North America, and the Columbia Gorge are in the watershed. Vegetation varies widely, ranging from western hemlock and western redcedar in the moist regions to <b>sagebrush</b> in the arid regions. The watershed provides habitat for 609known fish and wildlife species, including the bull trout, bald eagle, gray wolf, grizzly bear, and Canada lynx.|$|E
5|$|Only four {{species of}} {{reptiles}} are {{documented in the}} park: three species of snakes which are the wandering garter snake, the less commonly seen valley garter snake and rubber boa, {{as well as one}} lizard species, the northern <b>sagebrush</b> lizard, that was first reported in 1992. None of the species are venomous. Six amphibian species have been documented including the Columbia spotted frog, boreal chorus frog, tiger salamander and the increasingly rare boreal toad and northern leopard frog. A sixth amphibian species, the bullfrog, was introduced. An estimated 10,000 insect species frequent the park; they pollinate plants, provide a food source for birds, fish, mammals and other animals, and help in the decomposition of wood. In one example of the importance of insects to the ecosystem, swarms of Army cutworm moths die in huge numbers after mating and provide a high fat and protein diet for bears and other predators. One study concluded that when this moth species is most available, bears consume 40,000 moths per day which is roughly 20,000kcal/day.|$|E
5|$|Sheep {{are largely}} grazing herbivores, unlike {{browsing}} {{animals such as}} goats and deer that prefer taller foliage. With a much narrower face, sheep crop plants {{very close to the}} ground and can overgraze a pasture much faster than cattle. For this reason, many shepherds use managed intensive rotational grazing, where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover. Paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread of invasive plant species. By disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants. However, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as cheatgrass, leafy spurge, kudzu and spotted knapweed over native species such as <b>sagebrush,</b> making grazing sheep effective for conservation grazing. Research conducted in Imperial County, California compared lamb grazing with herbicides for weed control in seedling alfalfa fields. Three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds. Entomologists also compared grazing lambs to insecticides for insect control in winter alfalfa. In this trial, lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.|$|E
25|$|Greater sage-grouse occur {{throughout}} {{the range of}} big <b>sagebrush</b> (A. tridentata), except {{on the periphery of}} big <b>sagebrush</b> distribution. Greater Sage-Grouse prefer mountain big <b>sagebrush</b> (A. t. ssp. vaseyana) and Wyoming big <b>sagebrush</b> (A. t. ssp. wyomingensis) communities to basin big <b>sagebrush</b> (A. t. ssp. tridentata) communities.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sagebrush</b> {{communities}} supporting greater sage-grouse include silver <b>sagebrush</b> and fringed <b>sagebrush</b> (A. frigida).|$|E
25|$|<b>Sagebrush</b> cover types {{other than}} big <b>sagebrush</b> can fulfill greater sage-grouse habitat requirements; in fact, the grouse may prefer other <b>sagebrush</b> cover types to big <b>sagebrush.</b> Greater sage-grouse in Antelope Valley, California, for example, use black <b>sagebrush</b> (A. nova) cover types {{more often than}} the more common big <b>sagebrush</b> cover types. Hens with broods on the National Antelope Refuge in Oregon were most {{frequently}} found (54–67% of observations) in low <b>sagebrush</b> (A. arbuscula) cover. Desert shrub habitat may also be used by greater sage-grouse.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of <b>sagebrush</b> {{in the diet}} of adult greater sage-grouse is great; numerous studies have documented its year-round use. A Montana study, based on 299 crop samples, showed that 62% of total food volume {{of the year was}} <b>sagebrush.</b> Between December and February, it was the only food item found in all crops. Only between June and September did <b>sagebrush</b> constitute less than 60% of their diet. Sage grouse select <b>sagebrush</b> species differentially. Greater sage-grouse in Antelope Valley, California, browsed black <b>sagebrush</b> more frequently than the more common big <b>sagebrush.</b> The browse of black <b>sagebrush</b> is highly preferred by greater sage-grouse in Nevada. In southeastern Idaho, black <b>sagebrush</b> was preferred as forage.|$|E
25|$|Greater sage-grouse are obligate {{residents}} of the <b>sagebrush</b> (Artemisia spp.) ecosystem, usually inhabiting sagebrush-grassland or juniper (Juniperus spp.) sagebrush-grassland communities. Meadows surrounded by <b>sagebrush</b> {{may be used as}} feeding grounds. Use of meadows with a crown cover of silver <b>sagebrush</b> (A. cana) is especially important in Nevada during the summer.|$|E
25|$|Greater sage-grouse {{disperse}} {{to areas}} surrounding the leks for nesting. In {{a study of}} habitat selection by male greater sage grouse in central Montana during breeding season, <b>sagebrush</b> height and canopy cover at 110 daytime feeding and loafing sites of cocks were recorded. About 80% of the locations occurred in <b>sagebrush</b> with a canopy cover of 20–50%. In another Montana study, <b>sagebrush</b> cover averaged 30% on a cock-use area, and no cocks were observed in areas of less than 10% canopy cover.|$|E
25|$|Sage grouse {{are highly}} {{selective}} grazers, choosing {{only a few}} plant genera. Dandelion (Taraxacum spp.), legumes (Fabaceae), yarrow (Achillea spp.) and wild lettuce (Lactuca spp.) account {{for most of their}} forb intake. From July to September, dandelion comprised 45% of forb intake; <b>sagebrush</b> comprised 34%. Collectively, dandelion, <b>sagebrush,</b> and two legume genera (Trifolium and Astragalus) contributed more than 90% of the greater sage-grouse diet. Insects are a minor diet item for adults. Insects comprised 2% of the adult diet in spring and fall and 9% in summer. <b>Sagebrush</b> made up 71% of the year-round diet.|$|E
25|$|The greater sage-grouse is a {{permanent}} resident in its breeding grounds but may move short distances to lower elevations during winter. It makes use of a complex lek system in mating and nests on the ground under <b>sagebrush</b> or grass patches. It forages on the ground, mainly eating <b>sagebrush</b> but also other plants and insects. Greater sage-grouse {{do not have a}} muscular crop and are not able to digest hard seeds like other grouse.|$|E
25|$|The {{vegetation}} of Nevada is {{diverse and}} differs by state area. Nevada contains six biotic zones: alpine, sub-alpine, ponderosa pine, pinion-juniper, <b>sagebrush</b> and creosotebush.|$|E
