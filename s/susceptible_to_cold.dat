25|$|Most {{varieties}} go dormant in the fall, {{with reduced}} growth {{in response to}} low temperatures and shorter days. 'Nondormant' varieties that grow through the winter are planted in long-season environments such as Mexico, Arizona, and Southern California, whereas 'dormant' varieties are planted in the Upper Midwest, Canada, and the Northeast.

Cindy checks her computer and tells Dennis that the HO213 requires a certain temperature in order to be incubated. The infested water heading towards the coolant is where Major Madigan and his team is heading. Their goal was to sabotage the coolant reactor, letting H0213 freeze out to temporarily buy time.

50|$|Preferred growing {{conditions}} for S. sinensis {{are similar to}} those of the more commonly cultivated and closely related Japanese stewartia (S. pseudocamellia), though the latter is somewhat more cold-tolerant. Stewartia sinensis prefers full sun to part shade and moist, well-drained slightly acid soil in a protected location, but may be grown as a specimen tree in climates that do not test its cold-tolerance. It is hardy to USDA zone 5, but it has been suggested that young trees may be more <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> than older specimens, and should thus be protected during very cold temperatures until they reach mature sizes.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} main {{precursors}} for a frost quake cryoseism event to occur: (1) a region must be <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> air masses, (2) the ground must undergo saturation from thaw or liquid precipitation prior to an intruding cold air mass, (3) most frost quakes {{are associated with}} minor snow cover on the ground without {{a significant amount of}} snow to insulate the ground (i.e., less than 6 inches), and (4) a rapid temperature drop from approximately freezing to near or below zero degrees Fahrenheit, which ordinarily occurred on a timescale of 16 to 48 hours.|$|E
40|$|Individuals of African descent (AFD) {{are more}} <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> non-freezing <b>cold</b> injury (NFCI) than Caucasians (CAU) [1]. This {{may be a}} {{consequence}} of lower skin blood flow during local cold exposure and subsequent rewarming in AFD [2], possibly due to a difference in endothelium function as acet ylcholine (ACh) -induced vasodilatation is smaller in AFD than CAU on the non-glabrous finger and toe skin sites [3]. It is known that prostaglandins produced by the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) mediate part of the ACh-induced vasodilator response [4] however in hypertensive individuals, COX inhibition results in augmented vasodilatation in response to ACh [5] demonstrating that COX can also promote vasoconstriction. Whether COX products {{are involved in the}} attenuated vasodilator response to ACh in healthy AFD [3] is not known. Therefore, the aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the contribution of COX in both CAU and AFD to local application of ACh in foot and finger skin sites which are <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> NFCI...|$|R

50|$|Acacia obtusifolia is {{an upright}} or {{spreading}} perennial tree which grows from 1.5m to 8m in height {{and it is}} native to Australia. It {{is closely related to}} Acacia longifolia. Acacia obtusifolia can be distinguished by it having phyllode margins which are resinous, it usually blooms later in the year and it has paler flowers than Acacia longifolia. It flowers usually from December through February. Some populations of Acacia obtusifolia can survive winters to −6C and possibly a light snow, however plants from populations in areas that are frost free such as the coastal ranges of Northern NSW are <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> and will be killed by frosts lower than −3C. These populations avoid the valley floors and occur mainly on sandstone ridges well above the frost line.|$|E
50|$|Supercooling {{inhibits}} {{the formation}} of ice within the tissue by ice nucleation and allows the cells to maintain water in a liquid state and further allows the water within the cell to stay separate from extracellular ice. Cellular barriers such as lignin, suberin and the cuticle inhibit ice nucleators and force water into the supercooled tissue. The xylem and primary tissue of plants are very <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> temperatures {{because of the large}} proportion of water in the cell. Many boreal hardwood species in northern climates have the ability to prevent ice spreading into the shoots allowing the plant to tolerate the cold. Supercooling has been identified in the evergreen shrubs Rhododendron ferrugineum and Vaccinium vitis-idaea as well as Abies, Picea and Larix species. Freezing outside of the cell and within the cell wall does not affect the survival of the plant. However, the extracellular ice may lead to plant dehydration.|$|E
40|$|What {{an unusual}} winter – warmer than most; not much snow cover. Our {{perennial}} forage plants {{have experienced the}} same conditions. Perennial forages respond to the cooling days of autumn and “cold harden” to their genetic winter hardiness limits.

Snow cover and residual vegetative cover help to insulate the soil and stabilize soil and crown temperatures. Under ideal conditions, as spring temperatures warm through March, the plants break dormancy and regrow normally into the spring. Winter injury and winter kill can occur if crown temperatures go much below 0 degrees F, and when mid-winter warm spells cause the plants to break dormancy early and become more <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> late-winter <b>cold</b> crown temperatures.

40|$|The use {{of extreme}} {{temperatures}} {{is one of}} the few chemical residue-free techniques available for control of pest species and has proven fast and effective in a variety of applications. We determined the upper and lower lethal temperatures for the brown treesnake. We also investigated whether gender, size, body condition and exposure time influenced survival at temperature extremes. Elevating snake core temperatures to 40 °C and 41 °C for one hour resulted in 99 % mortality within seven days (40 °C) and 100 % mortality within one hour of exposure (41 °C). Mortality decreased sharply to 51 % for a one hour exposure to 39 °C. Shorter, heavier snakes were more <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> extreme hot temperatures, but gender had no effect. The lower lethal temperature was established at a body temperature of - 5 °C held for one hour. Males were more <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> extreme <b>cold</b> than females, as were snakes with lower body condition. These results imply that brown treesnakes are slightly more vulnerable than many invertebrate pests, suggesting that hot thermal fumigation would not require exceptional treatments and should be feasible for shipments containing most non-biological materials and some biological ones (e. g., some live plants, grain), and cold thermal fumigation should be feasible for all materials tolerant of being frozen...|$|R
40|$|The fungus Cryptococcus neoformans {{possesses}} a polysaccharide capsule and can form biofilms on medical devices. We describe {{the characteristics of}} C. neoformans biofilm development using a microtiter plate model, microscopic examinations, and a colorimetric 2, 3 -bis(2 -methoxy- 4 -nitro- 5 -sulfophenyl) - 5 -[(phenylamino) carbonyl]- 2 H-tetrazolium-hydroxide (XTT) reduction assay to observe the metabolic activity of cryptococci within a biofilm. A strong correlation between XTT and CFU assays was demonstrated. Chemical analysis of the exopolymeric material revealed sugar composition consisting predominantly of xylose, mannose, and glucose, indicating {{the presence of other}} polysaccharides in addition to glucurunoxylomannan. Biofilm formation was affected by surface support differences, conditioning films on the surface, characteristics of the medium, and properties of the microbial cell. A specific antibody to the capsular polysaccharide of this fungus was used to stain the extracellular polysaccharide matrix of the fungal biofilms using light and confocal microscopy. Additionally, the susceptibility of C. neoformans biofilms and planktonic cells to environmental stress was investigated using XTT reduction and CFU assays. Biofilms were less <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> heat, <b>cold,</b> and UV light exposition than their planktonic counterparts. Our findings demonstrate that fungal biofilm formation is dependent on support surface characteristics and that growth in the biofilm state makes fungal cells less <b>susceptible</b> <b>to</b> potential environmental stresses...|$|R
