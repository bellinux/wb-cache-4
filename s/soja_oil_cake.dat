Of these, Aspergillus flavus and A. niger {{were isolated}} {{from all the}} samples of groundnut and sesamum <b>oil</b> <b>cakes.</b> <b>Oil</b> <b>cakes</b> collected during June-July had the highest population of fungi. Positive and significant correlation was obtained between weather parameters and population of fungi. Key words: <b>Oil</b> <b>cakes,</b> fungal deterioration. <b>Oil</b> <b>cakes</b> are traditionally and widely used as manure and are the major constituents of cattle and poultry feed. Deterioration by microorganisms {{is a serious problem}} encountered in the storage and trans-port of <b>oil</b> <b>cakes.</b> Fungi are the major group respon-sible for the spoilage of <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> (philip, 1978;Nusrath and Nahdi, 1983 and Reddy et al., 1986). It has been estimated that at least 10 per cent of coconut products are lost as a result of mirotial activity (Subrahmanyan etal., 1965). Environmental factors also play an im-portant role in deterioration of stored products. (Subramanian, 1956; Niza, 1981). The present study aims at investigating the fungi responsible for the spoil-age of different <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> during storage and transit.

Gonadosomatic index (GSI), sperm quality, plasma sex steroids (11 -keto testosterone [11 -KT]; testosterone [T]; estradiol- 17 beta [E 2]) were evaluated on 10 to 24 fish fed on each diet. Sperm quality was assessed using computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA). Total replacement of fish meal by plant products markedly increased sperm volume, spermatocrit, spermatozoa integrity, and sperm motility. Fish fed diet 3 (12. 5 % fish meal) provided intermediate results on sperm quality whereas the lowest values were obtained in fish fed diets 1 and 2. In fish fed 0 % fish meal (diet 4), androgen levels were higher and estrogen levels were lower than in fish fed fish meal diets. Based on dietary lipid and fatty acid analyses, these results suggest a positive impact of short chain n- 6 fatty acids on androgen synthesis and sperm quality.

40|$|Large {{amounts of}} excess plant biomass are {{produced}} by agroindustries. Biotechnological innovations, mainly in the fermentation technology, have opened new areas for utilization of <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> as raw materials {{for the production of}} value added products. <b>Oil</b> <b>cakes</b> have been used as substrates in solid-state fermentation (SSF) for the enzymes production by filamentous fungi. This work deals with the optimisation of fermentation conditions which maximise the production of lipase from Aspergillus ibericus MUM 03. 49 under SSF using different <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> from Brazil. Combinations of <b>oil</b> <b>cakes,</b> moisture content (MC) and nitrogen sources were studied. Finally, the obtained lipase was applied in esterification reactions with different carboxylic acids and alcohols. SSFs were performed in 250 mL containing 15 g of <b>oil</b> <b>cake.</b> After lipase extraction, lipase activity was determined by spectrophotometric method, using p-nitrophenyl butyrate as substrate. Esterification reactions were performed in 15 mL falcon tubes with 5 mL volume reaction. Conversion yield was determined by the titration of the residual acid content, using 0. 1 M sodium hydroxide. Lipase production was significantly influenced by the <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> used. Palm kernel <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> (PKOC) presented higher lipase production (127 ± 17 U/g), following by sesame <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> (SOC) (78 ± 2 U/g), after 7 days of SSF. The combination of <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> PKOC+SOC led to maximum lipase production of 328 ± 6 U/g. Also, on PKOC+CrOC (crambe <b>oil</b> <b>cake)</b> it was possible to obtain high lipase activity (272 ± 23 U/g). A central composite design was performed to set optimum MC and ratio of PKOC+SOC. A MC of 57 % and a ratio of 0. 45 : 0. 55 PKOC:SOC were determined predicting a lipase production of 360 U/g. NH 4 Cl was found to be the best nitrogen source at concentration of 1 % (w/w). From the profile of lipase production over fermentation time, it was observed a continuous enzyme activity increase till the 6 th day, reaching 460 ± 38 U/g, corresponding to a productivity of 3. 2 ± 0. 3 U/(g h); and stabilizing till the end of 20 days, yielding 578 ± 20 U/g. Finally, the whole fermented cake with lipase was lyophilized and applied in esterification reactions, combining different carboxylic acids with alcohols. A 100 % conversion yield was obtained for decanoic acid with butanol using 20 % (w/w) lipase. Optimisation process led to the use of 5 % lipase in universal buffer at pH 7 or 8, for 24 h at 37 ºC, to obtain butyl decanoate ester. The biotechnological valorisation of SSF combining <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> is an interesting strategy to produce considerable amounts of lipase.

In the experiments various mass concentrations of Jatropha <b>Oil</b> <b>Cake</b> from 5 to 30 % were used. Composite materials were subjected to measurement of Shore D hardness and abrasion resistance of the three-point method according to ASTM - G 65. The results were analysed by statistical method ANOVA. Moisture of filler was 4. 59 ± 0. 22 % WB. Results show that composite materials have higher weight loss than the matrix if free abrasives (fraction F 60) were applied. When the free abrasives F 400 were used, composite material showed comparable results with the matrix. Using of filler {{had no effect on}} changes of hardness according to Shore D. The advantage of composite systems based on Jatropha <b>Oil</b> <b>Cake</b> is utilization of waste from the presswork process that is difficult to use in the future. For example it cannot be used as a feed for animals...|$|R
40|$|Soybean <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> and pigeonpea {{were the}} {{alternatives}} vegetable protein sources besides soybean. Their high protein content {{has not been}} considered yet in the food processing technology especially for tofu product. This study evaluated ratio of soybean <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> to pigeonpea used in tofu processing, tofu characteristics and recovery, anti nutrition content and organoleptics characteristics of tofu. Ratio of soybean <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> to pigeonpea {{used in this study}} were 100 : 0; 90 : 10; 80 : 20; 70 : 30; 60 : 40; and 50 : 50. The result showed that ratio of soybean <b>oil</b> <b>cake</b> to pigeonpea effected tofu characteristics and recovery. Ratio 100 : 0 gave the best result either in nutrition (protein) content or recovery, but the tofu contains the highest anti nutrition too. Tofu made from material with ratio of 90 : 10 and 80 : 20 had the same characteristics and better than others. Organoleptically, tofu made from material with ratio 100 : 0; 90 : 10 and 80 : 20 were valued higher than others. This study needs to be developed in order to find the best processing technique and condition in larger scale...|$|R
50|$|Kerala Solvent Extractions Ltd, {{now known}} as KSE Ltd (BSE: 519421, NSE: KSE), {{is a company that}} is engaged in the {{manufacture}} of Cattle feed, <b>Oil</b> <b>Cake</b> processing (extraction of <b>oil</b> from copra <b>cake</b> by solvent extraction process and refining the same to edible grade), and Dairy products in Irinjalakkuda, Thrissur District, state of Kerala, India. The Company was incorporated on 25 September 1963 and began commercial operations in April, 1972 by setting up Kerala’s first solvent extraction plant to extract coconut oil from coconut <b>oil</b> <b>cakes.</b> Subsequently, in 1976 the company set up a plant to manufacture ready mixed cattle feed. In the last three decades, KSE has emerged as a leader in solvent extraction from coconut <b>oil</b> <b>cakes</b> and also the largest cattle feed producer and supplier in Kerala. In 2000, KSE entered the business of procuring, processing and marketing milk and milk products. In 2002, KSE started producing and marketing icecreams under brand name 'Vesta'.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{production}} of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) using agro- industrial residues as the carbon source. Seven substrates, viz., wheat bran, potato starch, sesame <b>oil</b> <b>cake,</b> groundnut <b>oil</b> <b>cake,</b> cassava powder, jackfruit seed powder and corn flour were hydrolyzed using commercial enzymes and the hydrolyzates assessed for selecting the best substrate for PHB production. Jackfruit seed powder gave the maximum production of PHB under submerged fermentation using Bacillus sphaericus (19 %) at the initial pH of 7. 5...|$|R
