To {{those who do not}} know the delightful hill station of Southern India let me explain that Pietermaritzburg stands in a basin of <b>smooth</b> <b>rolling</b> downs, broken frequently by forests of fir and blue gum trees. It is a sleepy, dead-alive place. Even the fact that Colonel Knowle, the military engineer, was busily putting it into a state of defence, digging up its hills, piercing its walls, and encircling it with wire obstructions did not break its apathy. The 'Times of Natal' struggled to rouse excitement, and placarded its office with the latest telegrams from the front, some of which had reached Pietermaritzburg via London. But the composure of the civil population is a useful factor in war, and I wish it were within the power of my poor pen to bring home to the people of England how excellently the colonists of Natal have deserved of the State.|$|E
60|$|All traffic {{had stopped}} for London--not {{so bad for}} the little Iota--and we did not see a steamer that was worth a torpedo between Dungeness and the Isle of Wight. There I called Stephan up by wireless, and by seven o'clock we were {{actually}} lying {{side by side in}} a <b>smooth</b> <b>rolling</b> sea--Hengistbury Head bearing N.N.W. and about five miles distant. The two crews clustered on the whale-backs and shouted their joy at seeing friendly faces once more. Stephan had done extraordinarily well. I had, of course, read in the London paper of his four ships on Tuesday, but he had sunk no fewer than seven since, for many of those which should have come to the Thames had tried to make Southampton. Of the seven, one was of twenty thousand tons, a grain-ship from America, a second was a grain- ship from the Black Sea, and two others were great liners from South Africa. I congratulated Stephan with all my heart upon his splendid achievement. Then as we had been seen by a destroyer which was approaching at a great pace, we both dived, coming up again off the Needles, where we spent the night in company. We could not visit each other, since we had no boat, but we lay so nearly alongside that we were able, Stephan and I, to talk from hatch to hatch and so make our plans.|$|E
60|$|So I {{made up my}} bed on the floor; and he {{took the}} first spell, pistol in hand and sword on knee, three hours by the captain's watch upon the wall.

All my watch there was nothing stirring; and by the banging of the helm I knew they had even no one at the tiller. Indeed (as I learned afterwards) there were so many of them hurt or dead, and the rest in so ill a temper, that Mr. Riach and the captain had to take turn and turn like Alan and me, or the brig might have gone ashore and nobody the wiser. It was a mercy the night had fallen so still, for the wind had gone down as soon as the rain began. Even as it was, I judged by the wailing of a great number of gulls that went crying and fishing round the ship, that she must have drifted pretty near the coast or one of the islands of the Hebrides; and at last, looking out of the door of the round-house, I saw the great stone hills of Skye on the right hand, and, a little more astern, the strange isle of Rum.|$|E

40|$|Images {{from the}} DS 1 MICAS CCD camera reveal in three dimensions, the complex {{characteristics}} of Borrelly's nucleus, coma, and jets. The images acquired {{during the last}} 2 hours of the approach, as the nucleus became resolved and grew to roughly 150 pixels in length, provide stereo coverage of both the nucleus and inner coma {{over a wide range}} of phase angle and exposure time. The principal structure in the coma is a sunward-pointed collimated jet that is also visible in ground-based images. This jet is canted about 30 degrees off the sun line and appears to be roughly aligned with the local vertical at the surface from where it originates. Long-exposure images reveal details {{of the structure of the}} inner coma. They show the jet, visible at long range, to be composed of at least three discrete components whose locations evidently correspond to specific surface features. The elongated nucleus exhibits topographically distinct terrains and strong albedo variegations (of at least a factor of 2). The jets emanate from within the brighter <b>smoother</b> <b>rolling</b> plains. A consistent model is that the main jets are co-aligned with the rotation axis of the nucleus and issue from regions on the plains that are currently in constant sunlight.

5000|$|Paddle {{tires are}} mainly used on off road vehicles, {{specifically}} designed for use in sand and mud. They consist of a smooth tire core which has a series of large rubber cups (or paddles) attached to it. The volume inside of a paddle is {{much larger than the}} void of a knobby tire, so it is unlikely to clog up with sand/mud. A street legal mud tire is a more or less normal tire, but with extra large gaps or [...] "voids" [...] between each tread block (called [...] "lugs") to allow centrifugal force to [...] "self-clean" [...] or fling the mud out of the gap. Smaller gaps trap the mud in between the tire lugs, which turns the tire into something resembling a [...] "slick" [...] with no tread at all, which will have no traction in mud. A paddle tire is an even more extreme version of this, optimized for mud or sand. The paddle provides superior traction in the sand, in part, because the paddles dig into the sand and push off from the buried sand, not just the surface, and in mud, the gigantic [...] "voids" [...] give no place for mud to stick. They work something like a paddle wheel on a paddle-steamer. Street legal mud tires are a compromise between large voids and a <b>smooth</b> <b>rolling</b> shape for on-road use. The more [...] "extreme" [...] a mud tire (such as a [...] "Super Swamper") is, the harsher and louder it is on a hard surface. A [...] "tractor tire" [...] on a farm tractor is a somewhat more mild version of a paddle tire, only the voids are smaller to allow for limited use on hard surfaces, and the [...] "lugs" [...] are angled to give lateral traction. A paddle tire is so optimized for mud that the shape is of no use on anything other than a soft surface, since the vibration and lack of control of the tire would render a vehicle almost unusable. One other way the paddle tire is a specialized-application-only is that it gives only forward/rearward traction. This means that it is used on a wheel that drives a vehicle to push it forward, but gives little [...] "lateral" [...] (side-to-side) traction. For that reason, the tires of the vehicle that steer it are generally more [...] "normal" [...] tires, since a paddle tire on a steering wheel will just slide sideways rather than pulling the vehicle with it. So many 4WD vehicles will use paddle tires only on the rear, although the front wheels are powered as well. On a 2WD or a motorbike, the rear wheel is the only drive wheel, and so putting a paddle tire on the front wheels is useless or worse, since steering performance will be negatively impacted.|$|E
25|$|Patches of less cratered, <b>smoother,</b> less <b>rolling</b> plains occur {{throughout}} the quadrangle, but their recognition is {{highly dependent on}} the resolution and lighting of individual Mariner 10 frames. Therefore, because their distribution cannot now be mapped accurately, many of these patches are included with the smooth plains material. Certain patches of these intermediate plains, where clearly rougher and possibly older, are mapped as the intermediate plains material. These patches occur mostly within the floors of ancient craters and are distinguished by a slightly greater density of small craters and a lower incidence of small bright-halo craters than are found on the smooth plains material. The presence of plains intermediate in roughness and crater density between the oldest plains and the post-Caloris plains suggests that plains formation was {{a more or less}} continuous process that spanned much of the early geologic history of Mercury.|$|R

Using the measured viscoelastic modulus of unfilled and filled (with carbon black) nitrile rubber, we compare numerically exact results for the rolling friction with the prediction of a simple analytical theory.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{numerical}} study of tyre/road contact {{within the framework of}} rolling noise prediction. A macro-scale approach based on inter-summit contact description between road asperities is used for solving the contact problem between a real road surface and an elastic half-space representing the tyre tread. For efficient applications to road surfaces, an appropriate partition of the surface has been used in addition with an analytical load/penetration relation for a single road asperity. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the method, numerical contact forces for a small sample of road are compared to those obtained with a classical matrix inversion method. It is concluded that the model is accurate enough to predict tyre/road contact forces for rolling noise estimation. Then numerical evaluation of dynamical contact forces for a <b>smooth</b> tyre <b>rolling</b> on a road surface over several meters is presented, allowing the calculation of force spectra...|$|R

40|$|A {{statistical}} analysis {{of a series of}} interior vehicle noise measurements on a set of 1106 automotive vehicles, both petrol and diesel versions, from one manufacturer is presented: a small hatchback model and a mid-sized family 5 -door car. The engines were run at 50 rpm intervals over therange from 1000 rpm up to 4000 and 5950 rpm for the diesel and petrol variants respectively, with full load in econd gear whilst the vehicle was on a dynamometer roller test rig, comprising a <b>smooth</b> <b>rolling</b> surface. The measured interior noise at four positions corresponding to passenger ear locations were subsequently analysed in third octave bands as well as the overall levels, with statistical tests being performed on the linear rms pressures. The normalised standard deviation of the linear data decreases with increasing frequency. It is typically less than 0. 1 over the whole audio frequency range irrespective of vehicle type or engine. A lognormal distribution provides the best fit to the majority of the engine noise results and the overall engine noise could be described by a lognormal or gamma distribution. A lognormal distribution fit implies that the values in dB are normally distributed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{increased}} awareness {{for the environment}} and steadily higher costs for gasoline makes bicycles more and more attractive for short-distance traffic. Due to this the infrastructure of cycling pathways gets more important not only for safety reasons {{but also for the}} aspect of cycling (dis) comfort. Comfortable cycling requires <b>smooth</b> <b>rolling</b> at lowest possible energy input. To better understand this relationship, the objective {{of the study was to}} determine rolling resistance and the resulting accelerations due to external agitations for different surfaces. Rolling resistance was quantified using a one degree of freedom pendulum (transversal rotation). By setting it at an initial angular displacement the measured decay of oscillations is a direct measure for the rolling resistance. To investigate the vibrations, an accelerometer was applied under the seat of a racing bicycle. The cyclist had to roll over a distance of 15 m at 3 different velocities with no pedaling. Four different surfaces were investigated. An effective value factor was defined for an overall description of the observed data. The covered distance of the pendulum is directly related to the rolling resistance and varied from 22, 1 m on concrete slabs to 10, 2 m on cobblestones. Asphalt and self-binding gravel rank in between. This ranking however changes when analyzing the vibrations. Lowest effective value factors were measured on asphalt (0, 05) whereas concrete slabs (0, 17), self-binding gravel (0, 21) and cobblestones (0, 57) are far behind. Comfort decreases with higher velocities. The results of this study allow suggestions about the best surface for cycling pathways thus making the systematic design of comfortable bicycle lanes easier. Designing bike lanes for comfort is an important issue to persuade more people to use the bike, especially the elderly population...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{powertrain}} analysis, {{simulation of}} driveline models are standard tools, where efficient and accurate simulations are important {{features of the}} models. One input signal with high impact on the accuracy is the road slope.

To overcome this problem road-slope information is analyzed with the aid of both measured and synthetic road profiles, where the latter are generated from regulatory road specifications. The analysis shows {{that it is possible to}} separate vehicle shuffle resonances and road-slope information, and designs are proposed for on- and off-line filtering of the road-slope-sensor signal in spatial coordinates. Applying the filter to measured data shows that vehicle shuffle is significantly attenuated, while the shape of the road slope profile is maintained.

Our system consists of a spherical ball which rolls {{on the inside of}} an ellipsoidal bowl. The bowl has a single translational degree of freedom not aligned with any of its principal axes.

The object and contact motions are governed by a nonlinear system of equations derived from the kinematics and dynamics of rolling. Using existing results on small time local accessibility (STLA) and weakly positive Poisson stable (WPPS) vector fields, and assuming that the ball stays in the bowl, we show that the ball is globally controllable on its five-dimensional space of configurations relative to the bowl.
