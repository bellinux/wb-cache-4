The {{purpose of this study}} was to attempt to develop objective carcass grade specifications for slaughter barrows and gilts. These grade specifications should have economic significance and at the same time should be practical and acceptable to the hog industry. Detailed carcass measurements were made of 600 hog carcasses at the Iowa Packing Company, Des Moines, Iowa. Each carcass then was subjected to a detailed cutout test to determine the weight and quality g:t:ade of the various component wholesale cuts and trimmings. The ratio of the weights of the four high-value lean cuts (hams, loins, picnics and boston butts) to the total carcass weight was computed for each carcass. This ratio (called the index of lean) is a measure of the relative values of the hog carcasses. The higher the index of lean, the higher the value of the carcass, until the point is reached where the carcasses are discounted for lack of quality. Thus, for any <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> for the various wholesale cuts and trimmings there is an optimum index of lean which will yield the highest carcass value...|$|E

40|$|Rising {{prices in}} the German {{wholesale}} electricity market have spurred discussions about the potentials and the abuse of market power. Particularly since the introduction of emission certificates, electricity prices increased continuously- closely related to rising certificate prices. The oligopolistic structure of the German market with four major players owning 90 % of the capacities (Bundeskartellamt, 2006) leads to the presumption of significant market power potentials. A more detailed look at the market structure reveals that E. ON and RWE already own up to 60 % of generation capacities. This market structure creates incentives for strategic behavior to distort competitive price-quantity outcomes. In order to simulate the market structure and estimate market power potentials the supply function equilibria approach (SFE) is {{for the first time}} used for the German electricity generation market. The underlying theory has been developed by Klemperer and Meyer (1989). It is generally considered to be a more appropriate modeling of market power than traditional Cournot or Bertrand oligopolies, because firms in electricity markets often compete by offering a <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> and quantities rather than using only quantity or price as a strategic variable. The SFE approach explicitly considers demand uncertainties, typical for the electricity sector where bids are settled before demand is realized. In result, one obtains optimal supply schedules for the bidding firms. A drawback of those models is the absence of a single solution: there is rather a bundle of supply functions which are all equilibria to th...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the only}} places where {{environmental}} quality is traded on explicit markets is real estate. There are several techniques {{that can be used}} to study the effects of environmental quality on property values and infer willingness to pay for improvements. The most commonly used method is the hedonic model. In environmental economics the hedonic model has mainly been applied to the prices of real property and to wages. It assumes that there is a <b>schedule</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> for the differentiated product (i. e., houses) that can be estimated. An alternative set of models postulates that consumers' choices are discrete between houses rather than continuous in characteristics as in the hedonic model. Discrete choice models are applied to estimate consumer preferences. Recently a model has been developed that mixes discrete and continuous decisions and emphasizes the locational equilibrium. This chapter reviews these techniques, with an emphasis on methodological issues and recent developments. Section 2 describes the theoretical models that underlie these techniques. The theoretical hedonic model is developed first, and then the theoretical modifications that are necessary for the discrete choice models are described. The main models are developed for residential properties, but differentiated factors of production are discussed briefly. Section 3 is devoted to the empirical issues involved in estimating a hedonic price schedule. This is the most common type of estimation in property value models. Section 4 discusses the empirical application of the second stage of the hedonic model, the estimation of the underlying preferences. Section 5 covers the two types of discrete choice models that are used in environmental economics, random utility models and random bidding models. Section 6 briefly discusses the new locational equilibrium models, and the final section is devoted to conclusions and directions for further research. ...|$|E
