40|$|This study {{aimed to}} test {{probability}} density functions for {{the distribution of}} variables total height, transverse area and individual volume, considering three different class intervals. Data {{were obtained from the}} measurement of diameter (DBH) and total height and from estimation of the individual volume of 338 pine trees in a fragment of Mixed Ombrophylous Forest with an area of 15. 24 ha, which is located in Jardim Bot√¢nico campus of UFPR, Curitiba-PR. Ten functions were fitted, including commonly used models for diameter distribution as well as other recently developed models applied to forest science. Selection criteria included Kolmogorov-Smirnov adherence test, standard error of estimate in percentage and adjusted coefficient of determination. Three class intervals were used as obtained by Sturges, Dixon & Kronmal, and Velleman criteria. The Normal function for variable height, and the Weber function for distribution of transverse area and individual volume, provided the best fit, considering the three class intervals adopted. The models fitted better for larger size class intervals as obtained by <b>Sturges</b> <b>rule...</b>|$|E
40|$|Forecasting {{accuracy}} {{is one of}} the most favorable critical issues in Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models. The study compares the application of two forecasting methods on the amount of Taiwan export, the Fuzzy time series method and ARIMA method. Model discussed for the ARIMA method and Fuzzy time series method include the <b>Sturges</b> <b>rules.</b> When the sample period is extend in our models, the ARIMA models shows smaller than predicted error and closer predicted path to the realistic trend than those of the Fuzzy models, resulted in more accurate forecast of the export amount the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average models. In the economic viewpoints, the amount of Taiwan export is mainly attributable to external factors. However, this impact reduces with time and export amount in the time series analysis. The ARIMA models can be utilized to predicted export value accurately, when all of value or data is available...|$|R
