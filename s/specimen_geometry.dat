Two sets of woven fabric material properties found in literature were used to quantify the influence of <b>specimen</b> <b>geometries</b> on the resulting strain distributions. The uniformity of the strain distribution is quantified by taking the ratio between the two orthogonal strain components and characterizing its gradient across the central area of the gage section. The analysis results show that increasing the specimen s length relative to its width promotes a more uniform strain distribution in the central section of the cruciform test specimen under equibiaxial enforced tensile displacements. However, for the two sets of material properties used in this study, this trend did not necessary hold, when the enforced tensile displacements in the two orthogonal directions were not equal.

Series of mechanical tests at wide ranges of stress and strain rates are essential to identify the material's damage and fracture behaviour identical to realistic conditions. In the present contribution, an extensive experimental program has been developed to assess the dynamic fracture properties of dual phase steel (DP-K 1000). Various tensile <b>specimen</b> <b>geometries</b> covering wide range of stress states are employed for testing at quasi static conditions. The limitations imposed on the sample geometries by clamping technique and requirements of high strain rate test based on split Hopkinson bar test principle restrict the use of static geometries for the dynamic range.

The chevron notch geometry is commonly in shape of a triangle with different bond patterns.
