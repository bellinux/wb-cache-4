50|$|The Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive 2009/65/EC is a {{consolidated}} EU Directive, {{that allows}} collective investment schemes to operate freely throughout the EU {{on the basis}} of a <b>single</b> <b>authorisation</b> from one member state. EU member states are entitled to have additional regulatory requirements for the benefit of investors.|$|R

40|$|For the 28 {{member states}} of the European Union, Regulation (EU) No 536 / 2014 on {{clinical}} trials on medicinal products for human use, which repeals Directive 2001 / 20 /EC, represents a substantial innovation in the procedures for authorising clinical trials and for handling all the subsequent stages. It introduces a <b>single</b> <b>authorisation</b> that will be valid for all EU member states, {{as well as a}} single portal through which all data concerning all clinical trials performed throughout the EU will pass. The present article offers an overview of the general aspects of the new procedures. It does not address the specific issues involved, each of which merits separate examination...|$|R
40|$|Owners {{of systems}} and {{resources}} usually {{want to control}} who can access them. This {{must be based on}} having a process for authorising certain parties, combined with mechanisms for enforcing that only authorised parties are actually able to access those systems and resources. In distributed systems, the authorisation process can include negative authorisation (e. g. black listing), and delegation of authorisation rights, which potentially can lead to conflicts. This paper describes a method for giving authorisations through a delegation network, and where each delegation and authorisation is expressed {{in the form of a}} belief measure. An entity's total authorisation for a given resource object and access type can be derived by analysing the delegation network using subjective logic. Access decisions are made by comparing the derived authorisation measure with required threshold levels, which makes authorisations non-categorical. By setting the threshold level higher than the assigned measure of a <b>single</b> <b>authorisation,</b> it is possible to require multiple authorisations for accessing specific resources. The model is simple, intuitive and algebraic...|$|R
50|$|Collecting {{societies}} sell blanket licences, which {{grant the}} right to perform their catalogue {{for a period of}} time. Such a licence might for example provide a broadcaster with a <b>single</b> annual <b>authorisation</b> encompassing thousands of songs owned by thousands of composers, lyricists and publishers. The societies also sell individual licenses for users who reproduce and distribute music. For example, Apple must submit the download reports for the iTunes Store, which are used to determine their royalty payments.|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes how}} queries work in version 3. 2 of the RIPE Database. This version uses the Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL) [1] to represent {{many of the}} database objects. It uses the Routing Policy System Security (RPSS) [2] for <b>authorisation.</b> This <b>means</b> better security for Internet Routing Registries (IRR). It makes use of RPSL next generation specifications [14]. This means that you can register multicast and IPv 6 routing policies. Though this document is self-contained, you may also wish to read the RPSL [1] and RPSS [2] specifications. For a tutorial on RPSL, {{you can read the}} RPSL applications document [3]. Intended Audience This reference manual is for casual and advanced users who query the RIPE Database. If you are new to this database, you might find the "RIPE Database User Manual – Getting Started " [5] to be a more helpful place to start.

50|$|Once a {{substance}} has been officially {{identified in the}} EU as being of very high concern, it {{will be added to}} a list (the Candidate List). This list is available on ECHA’s website and shows consumers and industry which chemicals are identified as SVHCs. Substances placed on the Candidate List can then move to another list (the <b>Authorisation</b> List). This <b>means</b> that, after a given date, companies {{will not be allowed to}} place the substance on the market or to use it, unless they have been given prior authorisation to do so by ECHA. One of the main aims of this listing process is to phase out SVHCs where ever possible.|$|R
40|$|The Financial Services Reform Act 2001 (Cth) {{introduced}} new definitions of“derivative” and “financial product” {{into the}} Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), andreplaced the separate regulatory regimes governing futures contracts andsecurities with a <b>single</b> financial markets <b>authorisation</b> regime and a singleintermediary licensing regime. This {{article examines the}} reforms to evaluatewhether they have been successful. It is argued that there are definiteimprovements resulting from the reforms, and the scope for regulatoryarbitrage has been greatly reduced. However, numerous problems remain. There are {{significant differences in the}} regulation of securities and deriva-tives. The distinction between securities and derivatives is still based on legalcharacteristics, not economic function. There is uncertainty as to the exactscope and interaction of the definitions, particularly with respect to equityderivatives, warrants and options. The current law has thus not fullyaddressed many of the problems that existed prior to the reforms...|$|R
40|$|MPhil (Environmental Law and Governance), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 Mining {{contributes}} {{significantly to}} the economic development of South Africa, contributes to pollution and other negative environmental impacts. Section 24 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Constitution) places a duty on government to, amongst others adopt legislative measures to protect the environment, prevent pollution and degradation, and secure sustainable development, while promoting justifiable economic and social development. Government responded {{with the introduction of}} new acts or the amendment of existing acts most of which require an authorisation process as a “command and control” tool to enforce environmental governance within the mining sector. The abovementioned legislative development will be discussed from a historical perspective up to the current developments. The research aims to attempt to align the authorisation process pertaining to mining. The mining life cycle will be illustrated and the authorisation requirements for each of the mining life cycle processes will be discussed alongside its challenges such as fragmentation, lack of capacity in government sectors, lack of communication and cooperative governance within government. The lack of focus within the authorisation requirements will be deliberated. To avoid the negative consequences of the current authorisation processes such as duplication, unnecessary time delays and the stifling of economic growth, an investigation into how the various fragmented authorisation processes can be aligned into a <b>single</b> streamlined <b>authorisation</b> process which will contribute to the sustainable development within South Africa will be made.

30|$|Each OpenStack {{service has}} {{its own set of}} probes and effectors, which allows the Controller to {{interact}} with OpenStack. The information collected by the probes include the different activities related to access control that take place in the OpenStack platform, such as, access requests and authorisation decisions. As aforementioned, each OpenStack service contains a Log component that can be queried for this information (Steps 1 a and 1 d). There are also probes for obtaining the access control policies currently in place (Steps 1 c and 1 f), and information about users (Step 1 e) and about objects being protected (Step 1 b) by means of their respective PIP. This information is fed into the Monitor (Steps 2 a and 2 b), which is responsible for updating behavioural models in the Knowledge. The Analyse stage (3) is responsible for assessing the collected information in order to detect any malicious behaviours. This stage also identifies a set of possible adaptations for mitigating the perceived malicious behaviour, and prevent future occurrences. The Plan stage (Step 4) is responsible for deciding what to do and how to do it by selecting an appropriate adaptation (based on the set of possible adaptations provided by the previews stage) for dealing with the malicious behaviour, and producing the respective adaptation plan. Finally, the Execute stage (5) adapts the <b>authorisation</b> infrastructure by <b>means</b> of effectors (Steps 6 a and 6 b), which alter the access control policies in place through the PAP of each service, i.e., Keystone PAP (Step 7 a) and Swift PAP (Step 7 b).|$|R
