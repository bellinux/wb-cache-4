40|$|Recent {{research}} shows that Collaborative Information Retrieval (CIR), in which two or more users collaborate on the same search task, has become increasingly popular. The presence of both search and collaboration behaviors makes CIR a complex search format, which further drives a critical need to understand CIR's search context. The contextual support for CIR should consider search contexts derived from both team members' <b>search</b> <b>histories</b> (including users' own <b>search</b> <b>histories</b> and partners' <b>search</b> <b>histories)</b> and their explicit collaboration (e. g., chatting). As it stands, existing studies on contextual search support only focus on Individual Information Retrieval (IIR) and only utilize individuals' own <b>search</b> <b>histories.</b> In this paper, we examine the unique search contexts (e. g., partners' <b>search</b> <b>histories</b> and team collaboration histories) in CIR. Based on a user study data collection with 54 participants, we find that {{compared to the use}} of individuals' own <b>search</b> <b>histories,</b> CIR contextual support is more effective when utilizing partners' <b>search</b> <b>histories</b> and teams' collaboration behaviors. More interestingly, though the explicit communication information (i. e., chat content) often involves massive noisy information, involving such noise does not affect the ranking of relevant documents since it also does not appear in relevant documents...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} method that finds out {{interesting}} rules from the heterogeneous Internet <b>search</b> <b>histories.</b> Rule extraction aims to improve business performance through an understanding {{of past and present}} <b>search</b> <b>histories</b> of customers. A challenging task is to determine interesting rules from their heterogeneous <b>search</b> <b>histories</b> of shopping in the Internet. Customers visit web pages one after another and leave their valuable search information behind. Firstly we produce a homogeneous data set from their heterogeneous <b>search</b> <b>histories.</b> It is difficult task to produce a homogeneous data from heterogeneous data without changing their characteristics of data. Secondly these data are trained by unsupervised NN to get their significant classes. Thirdly, the interesting rules are extracted by inspecting the attributes of customers. These rules are interesting and important for the traders, marketers and customers for making future business plan. </span...|$|R

[...] Will Shaw of The Oxford Student noted the familiarity of dril's [...] "naive appeals to moderation" [...] and [...] "flame war posturing," [...] and said dril [...] "is the internet's collective id, given form. He's the internet equivalent of the Beowulf-poet; we may never know who he really is, but we recognise when he is being channelled." [...] Christine Erickson at Mashable said dril's character was like [...] "a spambot equivalent to the kind of crazy that Clint Eastwood portrays." [...] At Kotaku, Gita Jackson called dril a [...] "joke account that also inadvertently catalogues ... every way to be mad online." ...|$|E
