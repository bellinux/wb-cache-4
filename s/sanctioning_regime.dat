However, enforcement and sanctioning of possible violations remains {{the responsibility of}} Member States. Accordingly, the competencies of national regulatory authorities (NRAs) {{and the nature of}} sanctions have to be legislated in national law. In 2014, the Council of European Energy Regulators (CEER) issued a report on the implementation of REMIT at national level. The report concluded that no more than ″a majority of Member States have completed the transposition of Articles 13 and 18 of REMIT into national law {{in order to ensure that}} NRAs have the foreseen investigatory and enforcement powers, and that a <b>sanctioning</b> <b>regime</b> is in place.″ ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} effectiveness {{and limits of}} multilateral <b>sanctions</b> <b>regimes</b> as instruments of foreign policy, particularly when trying to prevent the acquisition, development and {{proliferation of weapons of}} mass destructions. I hypothesize that globalization undermines the overall effectiveness of <b>sanctions</b> <b>regimes.</b> I analyze the agents and means of globalization. Agents are nation-states, corporations, non-state actors and organizations, and individuals. Means are the global import-export industry, global banking and investment, global corporate models, and global manufacturing industries. They all have contributed to vast increases in transnational economic activity and, furthermore, to more political tensions between nation-states, all of which jeopardize the implementation and enforcement of multilateral <b>sanctions</b> <b>regimes.</b> ^ To test this thesis, I examine how those factors impacted the multilateral <b>sanctions</b> <b>regime</b> imposed against Iraq from 1991 to 2002. This multilateral <b>sanctions</b> <b>regime</b> was conceived, approved and enforced by most nations in the United Nations. ^ Indeed, evidence collected for this dissertation suggests that Iraq did manage to consistently circumvent the UN <b>sanctions</b> <b>regime,</b> and that it did it by astutely utilizing the agents and means of globalization. Evidence also indicates that Iraq managed to rebuild parts of its military infrastructure, and that Iraq was on its way to rebuild its missile capability, for which it purchased large quantities of parts, components, technologies and manpower in the global market. ...|$|R

These sanctions form part of a <b>sanctioning</b> <b>regime</b> resulting from a long standing dispute between the international community and the Islamic Republic of Iran concerning the latter's nuclear enrichment activities. Among the many restrictions imposed by the sanctions is the restriction on providing insurance to or on behalf of Iran or Iranian persons and entities as defined in the various sanctioning regimes and the aim of this thesis is to define {{the scope of the}}se restrictions and to examine the consequences to and response of the insurance industry to the restrictions on providing insurance...|$|E
40|$|LL. M. (Commercial Law) In {{sentencing}} {{a corporate}} criminal in South Africa the Criminal Procedure Act merely {{provides for a}} fine to be imposed as a sanction. In this dissertation I explore the numerous problems with fines, in order to portray how the use of fines as the sole method of punishment cannot truly attain the aims of punishment. I suggest that the aims of punishment could be more effectively obtained if a range of sanctions were to be pooled together to form an array of punishments from which the courts can choose. The legislature needs to further consider other preventative mechanisms and move towards a system of compliance which could be considered as supplemental to the punitive sanctions, thereby aligning South African sentencing with the recent global movement towards the aims of rehabilitative sentencing. Furthermore I illustrate how incorporating compliance into the criminal sphere will induce companies towards the adoption of self-regulation {{which is not to}} say that self-regulation should be solely relied on however, it would be a good spin-off of the new <b>sanctioning</b> <b>regime...</b>|$|E
40|$|Under {{the formal}} rules of {{criminal}} procedure, fact finders {{are required to}} apply a uniform standard of proof in all criminal cases. Experimental studies as well as real world examples indicate, however, that fact finders often adjust the evidentiary threshold for conviction {{in accordance with the}} severity of the applicable sanction. All things being equal, the higher the sanction, the higher the standard of proof that fact finders will apply in order to convict. Building on this insight, this Article introduces a new paradigm for criminal punishments-a paradigm that focuses on designing penalties that will reduce the risk of unsubstantiated convictions. By setting mandatory penalties of sufficient size, the legal system can induce fact finders to convict only if sufficient admissible evidence proves a defendant 2 ̆ 7 s guilt. This Article applies this theoretical framework to three concrete contexts that involve a high risk of erroneous convictions: inchoate crimes, the right to silence, and the punishment of recidivists. It shows that a <b>sanctioning</b> <b>regime</b> that is attuned to the probative function of punishment can protect innocent defendants from unsubstantiated convictions while obeying the dictates of both deterrence and retribution...|$|E

40|$|With {{the entry}} into force of the New Criminal Code, the offenses of road safety on public roads have been {{repealed}} from the Government Emergency Ordinance no. 95 / 2002 and inserted into {{the contents of the}} normative document. At the time of the transition, the legislator has chosen to amend certain aspects relating to the existing criminal incriminations of antisocial deeds in direct connection with the road domain. The regulation of the offense for putting into circulation or driving an unlisted vehicle contained in the provisions of article 334 of the New Criminal Code has a correspondent in Article 85 of the GEO no. 195 / 2002 on the circulation on public roads. The deeds incriminated by the provisions referred to in Article 334 par. (1), (2), (3) and (4) have the content almost identical with the previous settlement thereof, with differences under the aspect of the <b>sanctioning</b> <b>regime.</b> Also, regarding the content, the only difference which is meant to better clarify the incrimination conditions refers to the requirement that the vehicle or the tram not to be registered or recorded according to the law.

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{sanctions}} and remedies against corporate officers for breaches {{of the provisions}} in the Corporations Law {{is an area of}} the law which has been largely neglected by the legislature. Although there have been several legislative reforms on remedies since the Corporations Law came into force, those reforms were ad hoc in nature and no attempt has been made to carry out a comprehensive review to assess the effectiveness of the existing sanctions and remedies in context of the needs of contemporary society. In consequence, there is increasing concern that the remedies employed in Australia for breaches of the Corporations Law are inadequate, inconsistent, out-dated and are confined within a narrow range. This thesis seeks to evaluate the current package of sanctions and remedies provided under Part 3. 2 of the Corporations Law. As part of this exercise, comparative studies are made with the remedies of other jurisdictions. The provisions for sanctions in Part 3. 2 are measured against parallel provisions in the Crimes Act of the Commonwealth and of New South Wales and Victoria. They are also measured against corresponding provisions in selected foreign jurisdictions. A further comparison is made between the traditional civil remedies under the common law and those in the Corporations Law. The evaluation of the <b>sanctioning</b> <b>regime</b> in Part 3. 2 is made against the criteria appropriateness, adequacy, consistency and accessibility. This thesis discusses the need for a complete re-assessment of the penalty structure to bring the remedies in line with community expectations...|$|E

40|$|The {{evidence}} in support of the deterrent effect of the certainty of punishment is far more consistent than that for the severity of punishment. However, the {{evidence in}} support of certainty’s effect pertains almost exclusively to apprehension probability. Consequently, the more precise statement is that certainty of apprehension, not the severity of the ensuing legal consequence, is the more effective deterrent. This conclusion has important policy implications among which are that lengthy prison sentences and mandatory minimum sentencing cannot be justified on deterrence. There are four major research gaps. The first concerns the mechanism by which police affect perceptions of the probability of apprehension. The second concerns the inextricable link between the deterrent effect of the threat of punishment and the potentially criminogenic effect of the experience of punishment. The third concerns the concept of a <b>sanction</b> <b>regime</b> defined by the sanctions legally available and how that legal authority is administered. Theories of deterrence conceive of sanctions in the singular not the plural and do not provide a conceptual basis for considering the differential deterrent effects of different components of the <b>sanction</b> <b>regime.</b> The fourth involves sanction risk perceptions. Establishing the link between risk perceptions and <b>sanction</b> <b>regimes</b> is imperative; unless perceptions adjust, however crudely, to changes in the <b>sanction</b> <b>regime,</b> desired deterrent effects will not be achieved...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the United Nation Security Council (SC) counter-terrorism measures, giving {{focus to the}} 1267 <b>sanctions</b> <b>regime</b> against individuals associated with terrorism. The procedures of the 1267 <b>sanctions</b> <b>regime</b> are critically reviewed, {{with the aim of}} indicating the human rights concerns, particularly relating to the fundamental procedural rights. The tension between human rights and the security interest behind the counter-terrorism measures is analyzed. Special importance is given {{to the nature of the}} sanctions measures, arguing them to be punitive and not only preventative measures. Thus, this study aims to argue that procedural rights should be guaranteed in the 1267 <b>sanctions</b> <b>regime</b> in accordance with human rights law. Secondly, this study aims to present constitutionalization of international community based on legal responsibility, which is reviewed through the progressive work of the International Law Commission. Firstly, the question of responsibility of the United Nations (UN) for the breaches of human rights obligations is analyzed, including the initial question of whether or not the human rights norms are binding towards the UN. Secondly, the focus is turned to the responsibility of the bodies implementing the SC 1267 sanctions measures. The question of responsibility for the implementation will be analyzed from two perspectives: first, from an international constitutionalist approach advocating for the hierarchy of norms in the international community. While the traditional hierarchy of norms invests supremacy to the UN Charter, the constitutionalist approach will lead to the question of responsibility for the implementation in accordance with the UN Charter obligations. When implementation measures, taken by another international or regional organization, are not in accordance with the 1267 <b>sanctions</b> <b>regime</b> obligations, the rules on responsibility will become applicable towards the organization. The second perspective for the responsibility of the implementation measures is the international pluralist approach relying on different legal orders acting parallel to each other. In connection with this perspective the question of State responsibility for circumventing its international obligations is analyzed. Third part of this study presents today’s international community after the improvements the UN has taken under the pressure of the decentralized challenges it has encountered concerning the 1267 <b>sanctions</b> <b>regime.</b> This study argues that even though the UN procedures regarding the 1267 <b>sanctions</b> <b>regime</b> have improved, they are still inadequate to accommodate the human rights concerns, particularly fundamental procedural rights, and that the constitutionalization of the international community requires rules on legal responsibility such as the ones the International Law Commission has drafted...|$|R
