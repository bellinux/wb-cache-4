50|$|The term {{infrared}} signature {{is used by}} defense scientists and the military to describe the appearance of objects to infrared sensors. An {{infrared signature}} depends on many factors, including the shape {{and size of the}} object, temperature and emissivity, reflection of external sources (earthshine, sunshine, <b>skyshine)</b> from the objects surface, the background against which it is viewed and the waveband of the detecting sensor. As such there is no all-encompassing definition of infrared signature nor any trivial means of measuring it. For example, the infrared signature of a truck viewed against a field will vary significantly with changing weather, time of day and engine loading.|$|E

40|$|Environmental impacts from {{electron}} accelerator {{operations at the}} Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, which is located near populated areas, are illustrated by using examples of three different accelerator facilities: the low power (a few watts) SSRL, the high power (a few kilowatts) PEP-II, and the 50 -kW SLC. Three types of major impacts are discussed: (1) off-site doses from <b>skyshine</b> radiation, mainly neutrons, (2) off-site doses from radioactive air emission, mainly {sup 13 }N, and (3) radioactivities, mainly {sup 3 }H, produced in the groundwater. It was found that, from SSRL operation, the <b>skyshine</b> radiation result in a MEI (Maximum Exposed Individual) of 0. 3 {mu}Sv/y while a conservative calculation using CAP 88 showed a MEI of 0. 36 {mu}Sv/y from radioactive air releases. The calculated MEI doses due to future PEP-II operation are 30 {mu}Sv/y from <b>skyshine</b> radiation and 2 {mu}Sv/y from air releases. The population doses due to radioactive air emission are 0. 5 person-mSv from SSRL and 12 person-mSv from PEP-II. Because of the stronger decrease of <b>skyshine</b> dose as the distance increases, the population dose from <b>skyshine</b> radiation are smaller than that from air release. The third environmental impact, tritium activity produced in the groundwater, was also demonstrated to be acceptable from both the well water measurements and the FLUKA calculations for the worst case of the SLC high-power dump...|$|E
40|$|A {{computationally}} {{simple method}} for estimating gamma-ray <b>skyshine</b> dose rates {{has been developed}} {{on the basis of}} the line-beam response function. Both Monte Carlo and pointkernel calculations that account for both annihilation and bremsstrahlung were used in the generation of line beam response functions (LBRF) for gamma-ray energies between 10 and 100 MeV. The LBRF is approximated by a three-parameter formula. By combining results with those obtained in an earlier study for gamma energies below 10 MeV, LBRF values are readily and accurately evaluated for source energies between 0. 02 and 100 MeV, for source-to-detector distances between 1 and 3000 m, and beam angles as great as 180 degrees. Tables of the parameters for the approximate LBRF are presented. The new response functions are then applied to three simple <b>skyshine</b> geometries, an open silo geometry, an infinite wall, and a rectangular four-wall building. Results are compared to those of previous calculations and to benchmark measurements. A new approach is introduced to account for overhead shielding of the <b>skyshine</b> source and compared to the simplistic exponential-attenuation method used in earlier studies. The effect of the air-ground interface, usually neglected in gamma <b>skyshine</b> studies, is also examined and an empirical correction factor is introduced. Finally, a revised code based on the improved LBRF approximations and the treatment of the overhead shielding is presented, and results shown for several benchmark problems...|$|E

40|$|Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) {{is located}} in {{northern}} California, USA. Radiological environmental protection {{is one of the}} main elements of the radiation protection program. One of SLAC’s accelerator facilities is B-Factory, whose PEP-II accelerator ring has been operating since 1997 and is being upgraded to higher luminosity operation. Four radiological issues associated with high luminosity operation up to CY 2008 are re-evaluated: 1) annual doses in IR halls, 2) annual <b>skyshine</b> doses at site boundaries, 3) potential radioactive air releases, and 4) potential groundwater activation. This paper presents the <b>skyshine</b> doses and air emission doses to the Maximally Exposed Individual (MEI) at SLAC site boundaries. The normal beam loss scenarios around PEP-II ring are presented first. In CY 2008, the luminosity is 2 x 10 34 cm- 2 s- 1, and the stored current is 4. 0 -A for low-energy ring (LER) and 2. 2 -A for high-energy ring (HER). The beam losses around PEP-II ring include those near injection region in IR 10 and IR 8 and those at collimators (e. g., HER collimators in IR 12, LER collimators in IR 4 and IR 6). The beam losses in IR 8 and IR 10 (where injection into ring occurs) are further divided into septum, BAD (beam abort dump) and TD (tune-up dump), as well as apertures. The <b>skyshine</b> prompt dose rate distributions as a function of distance from an IR hall at four directions were calculated using the MARS 15 Monte Carlo code. For <b>skyshine</b> dose to the MEI, the annual dose (7200 h/y occupancy) is calculated to be 2. 9 mrem/y at Sand Hill Road (from e- losses in IR 12 HER collimators) and 1. 2 mrem/y at Horse Track Offices near IR 6 (from e...|$|E

40|$|The {{estimated}} {{dose equivalent}} rates outside the shielded storage ring, and the estimated annual dose equivalent {{to members of}} the public due to direct radiation and <b>skyshine</b> from the ring, have been recalculated. The previous estimates found in LS- 84 (MOE 87) and cited in the 1987 Conceptual Design Report of the APS (ANL 87) required revision because of changes in the ring circumference and in the proposed location of the ring with respect to the nearest site boundary. The values assumed for the neutron quality factors were also overestimated (by a factor of 2) in the previous computation, and the correct values have been used for this estimate. The methodology used to compute dose and dose rate from the storage ring is the same as that used in LS- 90 (MOE 87 a). The calculations assumed 80 cm thick walls of ordinary concrete (or the shielding equivalent of this) and a roof thickness of 1 meter of ordinary concrete.

40|$|During the {{operation}} of research facilities at Research Centre Jülich, Germany, nuclear waste is stored in drums and other vessels in an interim storage building on-site, which has a concrete shielding at the side walls. Owing {{to the lack of}} a well-defined source, measured gamma spectra were unfolded to determine the photon flux {{on the surface of the}} containers. The dose rate simulation, including the effects of <b>skyshine,</b> using the Monte Carlo transport code MCNP is compared with the measured dosimetric data at some locations in the vicinity of the interim storage building. The MCNP data for direct radiation confirm the data calculated using a point-kernel method. However, a comparison of the modelled dose rates for direct radiation and <b>skyshine</b> with the measured data demonstrate the need for a more precise definition of the source. Both the measured and the modelled dose rates verified the fact that the legal limits (< 1 mSv a(- 1)) are met in the area outside the perimeter fence of the storage building to which members of the public have access.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 This thesis evaluates dose {{rates from}} the TRIGA® reactor by {{comparing}} ion chamber measured exposure rates to exposure rates calculated from MCNP 5 model data. The first step evaluates the energy distribution required to match ion chamber exposure rates from measurements taken at 1 foot increments above the reactor core. Next, the back calculated source activity {{is used to}} determine the exposure rates, at those same 1 ft increments above the core, {{in the event of a}} loss of coolant accident (LOCA). Then the energies deposited in simulated ion chambers, above the core are {{used to determine the}} dose rate to a person standing on top of the reactor bioshield after a LOCA. The dose rates that are calculated using the MCNP 5 data were compared to calculations from the Oregon State TRIGA® Reactor (OSTR) Safety Analysis Report (SAR). The final step is to determine the maximum dose rate at the OSTR facility perimeter after a LOCA, due to <b>skyshine.</b> The MCNP 5 results showed that OSTR SAR overestimates dose rates at the top of the reactor bioshield. The discrepancy stems from the OSTR SAR using worst case scenario data, while this report uses less conservative, yet accurate, assumptions.

40|$|For most accelerators {{adequate}} side {{shielding can}} be provided at minimal cost to meet the most aggressive radiation protection regulations and, further, the likely requirement to increase shielding thickness still more {{at a later date}} can be done usually by heaping more earth or applying local shielding at minimal expense and inconvenience. This moderately happy state of affairs does not unfortunately hold true with roof shielding. The cost of roof shielding is largely predicated on the roof span and the necessary structural engineering requirements for its support. These measures can be extremely expensive and where one is dealing with the rather extensive unsupported spans typical of experimental halls devoted to experiments with high energy electron beams; it is necessary to specify the roof thickness as carefully as possible with the constant concern that adding more earth later {{is not likely to be}} possible without rebuilding the hall. Because of the nature of roof <b>skyshine,</b> and for most high energy accelerator facilities neutron <b>skyshine,</b> the effect of the radiation is likely to extend to the facility fence-line where one is concerned about the exposure of the general population. Very properly the dose limit for the general population is set at a rather low value (1 mSv y{sup {minus} 1 }) and in order for the Jefferson Lab (JLab) to ensure strict compliance with this limit they have a design goal for the fence line of 0. 1 mSv y{sup {minus} 1 }.

40|$|Preliminary {{plans for}} {{providing}} the proton beam {{needed by the}} proposed Mu 2 e experiment at Fermilab will require the transport of 8 GeV protons to the Accumulator/Debuncher where they be processed into an intensity and time structure useful for the experiment. The intensities involved are far greater that those encountered with antiprotons of the same kinetic energy in the same beam enclosures under Tevatron Collider operational conditions, the operating parameters for which the physical facilities of the Antiproton Source were designed. This note explores some important ramifications of the proposed operation for radiation safety and demonstrates the need for extensive modifications of significant portions of the shielding of the Accumulator Debuncher storage rings; notably that underneath the AP Service Buildings AP 10, AP 30, and AP 50. While existing shielding is adequate for the current operating mode of the Accumulator/Debuncher {{as part of the}} Antiproton Source used in the Tevatron Collider program, without significant modifications of the shielding configuration in the Accumulator/Debuncher region and/or beam loss control systems far more effective than seen in most applications at Fermilab, the proposed operational mode for Mu 2 e is not viable for the following reasons: 1. Due to <b>skyshine</b> alone, under normal operational conditions large areas of the Fermilab site would be exposed to unacceptable levels of radiation where most of the Laboratory workforce and some members of the general public who regularly visit Fermilab would receive measurable doses annually, contrary to workforce, public, and DOE expectations concerning the As Low as Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) principle. 2. Under normal operational conditions, a sizeable region of the Fermilab site would also require fencing due to <b>skyshine.</b> The size of the areas involved would likely invite public inquiry about the significant and visible enlargement of Fermilab's posted radiological areas. 3. There would be aesthetics questions about the employment of so much new fencing on the Fermilab site. 4.

Research for this thesis was conducted in March of 2010 at Lake Tahoe in various settings and snow depths. Images of footprints, snowmobile tracks, and other disturbances were captured by Bossa Nova's linear stokes polarization camera named SALSA. This device implemented a fast switching liquid crystal polarizing filter to separate polarized light onto a 782 x 582 pixel detector operating in the 400 to 700 nanometer range.

40|$|This {{calculation}} note {{supports the}} subsurface leak accident scenario which remains subsurface. It {{is assumed that}} a single walled pipe carrying waste from tank 106 -C ruptures, releasing the liquid waste into the soil. In this scenario, the waste does not form a surface pool, but remains subsurface. However, above the pipe is a berm, 0. 762 m (2. 5 ft) high and 2. 44 m (8 ft) wide, and the liquid released from the leak rises into the berm. The slurry line, which transports a source term of higher activity than the sluice line, leaks into the soil {{at a rate of}} 5 % of the maximum flow rate of 28. 4 L/s (450 gpm) for twelve hours. The dose recipient was placed a perpendicular distance of 100 m from the pipe. Two source terms were considered, mitigated and unmitigated release as described in section 3. 4. 1 of UANF-SD-WM-BIO- 001, Addendum 1. The unmitigated consisted of two parts of AWF liquid and one part AWF solid. The mitigated release consisted of two parts SST liquid, eighteen parts AWF liquid, nine parts SST solid, and one part AWF solid. The isotopic breakdown of the release in these cases is presented. Two geometries were considered in preliminary investigations, disk source, and rectangular source. Since the rectangular source results from the assumption that the contamination is wicked up into the berm, only six inches of shielding from uncontaminated earth is present, while the disk source, which remains six inches below the level of the surface of the land is often shielded by a thick shield due to the slant path to the dose point. For this reason, only the rectangular source was considered in the final analysis. The source model was a rectangle 2. 134 m (7 ft) thick, 0. 6096 m (2 ft) high, and 130. 899 m (131 ft) long. The top and sides of this rectangular source was covered with earth of density 1. 6 g/cm{sup 3 } to a thickness of 15. 24 cm (6 in). This soil is modeled as 40 % void space. The source consisted of earth of the same density with the void spaces filled with the liquid waste which added 0. 56 g/cm{sup 3 } to the density. The dose point was 100 m (328 ft) away from the berm in a perpendicular direction off the center. The computer code MICROSKYSHINEO was used to calculate the <b>skyshine</b> from the source. This code calculates exposure rate at the receptor point. The photon spectrum from 2 MeV to 0. 15 MeV, obtained from ISOSHLD, was used as input, although this did not differ substantially from the results obtained from using Co, 137 mBa, and 154 Eu. However, this methodology allowed the bremsstrahlung contribution {{to be included in the}} <b>skyshine</b> calculation as well as in the direct radiation calculation...|$|E
