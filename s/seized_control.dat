5|$|Even before Adolf Hitler <b>seized</b> <b>control</b> of Germany in 1933, the {{problems}} with the Minority Treaties were evident. Various European governments continued to abuse minorities, the latter loudly protested, their complaints were exploited by interested parties with ulterior motives, and the League interfered as little as possible. The system suffered an apparent death blow with Poland's rejection of its treaty in 1934.|$|E
5|$|The 7th Brigade, {{supported}} by the 2nd Field Regiment, {{was the first to}} commence operations, as the 9th Battalion launched a surprise attack in the central sector of the island upon a Japanese outpost at Little George Hill on 25 November.

5|$|Around 1785BC, as {{the power}} of the Middle Kingdom pharaohs weakened, a Western Asian people called the Hyksos had already settled in the Eastern Delta town of Avaris, <b>seized</b> <b>control</b> of Egypt, and forced the central {{government}} to retreat to Thebes. The pharaoh was treated as a vassal and expected to pay tribute. The Hyksos ("foreign rulers") retained Egyptian models of government and identified as pharaohs, thus integrating Egyptian elements into their culture. They and other invaders introduced new tools of warfare into Egypt, most notably the composite bow and the horse-drawn chariot.|$|E

The cells were replaced by open arcades known as dalans.|$|E
5|$|Soon afterward, Nigerian Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu <b>seized</b> <b>control</b> of the {{northern}} {{region of the country}} {{as part of a larger}} coup attempt. Commanders in other areas failed, and the plot was answered by a military crackdown. A massacre of three thousand people from the eastern region living in the north occurred soon afterwards, and stories of other attacks on Igbo Nigerians began to filter into Lagos.|$|E
5|$|The American Revolutionary War {{broke out}} in April 1775. The city of New York was already an {{important}} center of business but had not yet become a sprawling metropolis. It occupied only the lower portion of the island of Manhattan and had a population of approximately 25,000. Before the war began, the Province of New York was politically divided, with active Patriot organizations and a colonial assembly that was strongly Loyalist. After the battles of Lexington and Concord, Patriots <b>seized</b> <b>control</b> {{of the city and}} began arresting and expelling Loyalists.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{mention of}} Seibal in hieroglyphic inscriptions is on Stela15 at Dos Pilas, dated to 13 October 721, and refers to Seibal {{becoming involved in}} the long-running war between the great cities of Tikal and Calakmul and their respective allies and vassals. Dos Pilas was a newly founded city in the Petexbatún region, established by Tikal to exert its control over the Pasión River, a strategy that backfired when Calakmul <b>seized</b> <b>control</b> of the fledgling kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} of Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana's realm {{began with the}} capture of his brother Andrianavalonimerina's territory, which he ruled from Ambohitrabiby.

5|$|Île de France {{had been}} in a state of turmoil since the French Revolution and in 1792 the republican party on the island <b>seized</b> <b>control.</b> In 1794 {{suspected}} royalists were arrested, including the naval commander , their executions forestalled by the arrival of news that the French Convention had abolished slavery. Only the intervention of Governor Malartic prevented unrest. The preoccupation of the naval authorities had prevented any offensive operations and the reduced squadron, now commanded by Captain Jean-Marie Renaud, remained in Port Louis.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} off Trondheim, Admiral Hipper successfully passed {{herself off}} as a British warship long enough to steam past the Norwegian coastal artillery batteries. The ship entered the harbor and docked shortly before 05:30 to debark the mountain troops. After the ground troops <b>seized</b> <b>control</b> of the coastal batteries, the ship left Trondheim, bound for Germany. She was escorted by Friedrich Eckoldt; she reached Wilhelmshaven on 12 April, and went into drydock. The dockyard workers discovered the ship had been damaged more severely by the collision with Glowworm than had previously been thought. Nevertheless, repairs were completed {{in the span of}} two weeks.|$|E
5|$|By the 3rd century, Romanised Illyrians and Thracians, mostly primipilares {{and their}} descendants, came to {{dominate}} the army's senior officer echelons. Finally, the Danubian officer-class <b>seized</b> <b>control</b> of the state itself. In 268, the emperor Gallienus (ruled 260–68) was overthrown by a coup d'état organised by a clique of Danubian senior officers, including his successors Claudius II Gothicus and Aurelian (270–75). They and their successors Probus (276–82) and Diocletian (ruled 284–305) and {{his colleagues in the}} Tetrarchy formed a sort of self-perpetuating military junta of Danubian officers who were born in the same provinces (several in the same city, Sirmium, a major legionary base in Moesia Superior) and/or had served in the same regiments.|$|E

5|$|Corzine also chaired {{a presidential}} {{commission}} on capital budgeting for Bill Clinton {{and served as}} Chairman of the U.S. Treasury Department's borrowing committee. As the Goldman Sachs senior partner, he helped develop a private sector plan to rescue the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management when the leveraged fund's collapse {{in the fall of}} 1998 threatened contagion across the U.S. financial system. According to U.S. News & World Report, Corzine did not get along with co-CEO Henry Paulson, who came from the other major area of the bank, investment banking. When Corzine participated in structuring the bailout, Paulson <b>seized</b> <b>control</b> of the firm. As co-chairman of the firm, he oversaw its expansion into Asia. When Goldman Sachs went public after Corzine's departure, Corzine made $400million.|$|E
5|$|During {{his service}} in New Orleans, Beauregard became {{dissatisfied}} as a peacetime officer. He informed the U.S. Army Engineer Department late in 1856 {{that he was}} going to join the filibuster with William Walker, who had <b>seized</b> <b>control</b> of Nicaragua; he had offered Beauregard the rank of second-in-command of his army. Senior officers, including general-in-chief Winfield Scott, convinced Beauregard to stay in the United States. He briefly entered politics as a reform candidate for mayor of New Orleans in 1858, where he was promoted by both the Whig and Democratic parties to challenge the Know Nothing party candidate. Beauregard was narrowly defeated.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the native}} Egyptian rulers {{installed}} by Esarhaddon {{were unable to}} retain full control of the whole country for long. Two years later, Taharqa returned from Nubia and <b>seized</b> <b>control</b> of a section of southern Egypt {{as far north as}} Memphis. Esarhaddon prepared to return to Egypt and once more eject Taharqa; however, he fell ill and died in his capital, Nineveh, before he left Assyria. His successor, Ashurbanipal, sent an Assyrian general named Sha-Nabu-shu with a small, but well trained army, which conclusively defeated Taharqa at Memphis and once more drove him from Egypt. Taharqa died in Nubia two years later.|$|E
50|$|Orgetorix was {{intending}} {{to make an}} unlawful attempt in <b>seizing</b> <b>control</b> of all Gaul, with Dumnorix and Casticus as his other triumvirs. Unknown to the Helvetians, Orgetorix was making a deal that would involve the use of Helvetian soldiers to <b>seize</b> <b>control</b> of all Gaul, instead of a mere migration. If the conspiracy was to be carried out, the Aeduans, Sequanians, and the Helvetians under the threesome would have all of Gaul at their disposal.|$|R

There was an outbreak of nationalist fervour in Vietnam; Tảng and Thảo joined the Vanguard Youth, an impromptu independence militia. Tảng was assigned {{to be the leader}} of the local unit, but he left the movement soon after, leaving Thảo in command. During this period, Saigon was regularly engulfed in riots.|$|E
5|$|Jamestown {{was founded}} in 1659 by the English East India Company and named after James, Duke of York, the future King James II of England. A fort, {{originally}} named the Castle of St John, was quickly built and, with {{the restoration of the}} monarchy in 1660, the fort was renamed James Fort, the town Jamestown and the valley James Valley. The fort and associated gun batteries dominated James Bay and were sporadically improved over the years. In January 1673 the Dutch East India Company briefly <b>seized</b> <b>control</b> of the island until the English East India Company recaptured it in May. Since then the town has been continuously inhabited under English and then British rule.|$|E
