25|$|Suddenly the {{character}} of a Savior was vividly impressed upon my mind.

25|$|The song Hop Hop has {{political}} tones. It {{describes how}} the states exploit the citizens for their own purposes, how today's political systems are good for nothing, since {{the world is full}} of violence, war, human rights are many times oppressed, we are a subject to global warming and governments do little to <b>save</b> <b>us.</b> Tarkan explained in the interview that the song examines these problems and encourages people to unite, no matter what color our skin is or what religion we follow.|$|E

25|$|The Poles' {{resistance}} in Warsaw is a Jewish resistance. Only yids {{are capable of}} the blackmail of putting {{women and children in}} the front line, {{to take advantage of the}} Germans' sense of scruple. The Germans have no interest in the destruction of Romania. Only a pro-German government can <b>save</b> <b>us...</b> What is happening on the frontier with Bukovina is a scandal, because new waves of Jews are flooding into the country. Rather than a Romania again invaded by kikes, it would be better to have a German protectorate.|$|E
25|$|In the 13th lecture, Cyril of Jerusalem {{discusses}} the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus Christ. The main themes that Cyril focuses on in these lectures are Original sin and Jesus’ sacrificing himself to <b>save</b> <b>us</b> from our sins. Also, the burial and Resurrection which occurred {{three days later}} proving the divinity of Jesus Christ and the loving nature of the Father. Cyril was very adamant {{about the fact that}} Jesus went to his death with full knowledge and willingness. Not only did he go willingly but throughout the process he maintained his faith and forgave all those who betrayed him and engaged in his execution. Cyril writes “who did not sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth, who, when he was reviled, did not revile, when he suffered did not threaten”. This line by Cyril shows his belief in the selflessness of Jesus especially in this last final act of Love. The lecture also gives a sort of insight to what Jesus may have been feeling during the execution from the whippings and beatings, to the crown of thorns, to the nailing on the cross. Cyril intertwines the story with the messages Jesus told throughout his life before his execution relating to his final act. For example, Cyril writes “I gave my back to those who beat me and my cheeks to blows; and my face I did not shield from the shame of spitting”. This clearly reflects the teachings of Jesus to turn the other cheeks and not raising your hands against violence because violence just begets violence begets violence. The segment of the Catechesis really reflects the voice Cyril maintained in all of his writing. The writings always have the central message of the Bible; Cyril is not trying to add his own beliefs in reference to religious interpretation and remains grounded in true biblical teachings.|$|E

500|$|Some {{commentators}} have noted possible religious {{themes in the}} film. For instance, Fr. Robert Barron in The Catholic Register summarizes the tension between Gravitys technology and religious symbolism. He said, [...] "The technology which this film legitimately celebrates... can't <b>save</b> <b>us,</b> and it can't provide {{the means by which}} we establish real contact with each other. The Ganges in the sun, the St. Christopher icon, the statue of Budai, and above all, a visit from a denizen of heaven, signal that there is a dimension of reality that lies beyond what technology can master or access...the reality of God".|$|E

60|$|The great deliverers of men have, for {{the most}} part, saved them from calamities which we all {{recognise}} as evil, from calamities which are the ancient enemies of humanity.

But {{there is a huge}} and bottomless evil compared with which all these are flea-bites, the most desolating curse that can fall upon men or nations, and it has no name, except we call it satisfaction. Savonarola did not save men from anarchy, but from order; not from pestilence, but from paralysis; not from starvation, but from luxury. Men like Savonarola are the witnesses to the tremendous psychological fact at the back of all our brains, but for which no name has ever been found, that ease is the worst enemy of happiness, and civilisation potentially the end of man.|$|R

500|$|Longstreet soon {{clashed with}} Bragg and became {{leader of the}} group of senior commanders of the army who conspired to have him removed. Bragg's {{subordinates}} had long been dissatisfied with his leadership and abrasive personality; the arrival of Longstreet (the senior lieutenant general in the Army) and his officers, added credibility to the earlier claims, and was a catalyst toward action. Longstreet wrote to Seddon, [...] "I am convinced that nothing but the hand of God can <b>save</b> <b>us</b> or help us {{as long as we have}} our present commander." [...] The situation became so grave that President Davis was forced to intercede in person. What followed was one of the most bizarre scenes of the war, with Bragg sitting red faced as a procession of his commanders condemned him. Longstreet stated that Bragg [...] "was incompetent to manage an army or put men into a fight" [...] and that he [...] "knew nothing of the business." [...] Davis sided with Bragg and did nothing to resolve the conflict.|$|E
500|$|James Montgomery of MTV {{compared}} the album to Kid A {{because of the}} lack of guitars, the style of being completely different to the band's previous works, and the album's message. Montgomery said, [...] "None of these problems, these terrors or these specters that haunt us in 2010 are particularly new. Quite the opposite, in fact. We've just chosen to ignore the warnings. And now it might be too late." [...] According to turntablist Joe Hahn, the album's title is a reference to a line in the Hindu Sanskrit scripture the Bhagavad Gita [...] "If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one," [...] which was made famous by J. Robert Oppenheimer in reference to the atomic bomb. The title also appears in the album's lead single [...] "The Catalyst", which appears in the line [...] "God <b>save</b> <b>us</b> everyone, will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?". The band said Oppenheimer's comments about the nuclear bomb influenced the apocalyptic themes of the album. The band wrote about these comments in the album's liner notes: ...|$|E

500|$|Reviews {{were mostly}} negative. Mac Slocum of Filmfodder.com said the {{flashback}} storyline [...] "wasn't all that interesting". Entertainment Weeklys Jeff Jensen called the flashbacks [...] "among the poorest and most clumsily integrated flashbacks we've seen so far", {{as he felt}} nothing new was learned, and also disliked Michael's on-Island storyline, noting he [...] "got {{the sense that the}} actors and directors weren't quite sure what to make of these scenes". Jensen however complimented the Hatch scenes, considering that Terry O'Quinn's performance and his interaction with Henry Ian Cusick were [...] "salvaging the first mediocre episode of the season". Ryan Mcgee of Zap2it thought that revealing the Hatch events through different perspectives a [...] "fresh narrative approach", but complained about the lack of plot advancement, and considered the raft storyline [...] "three times as long as needed, with a really fake shark attack to boot". IGN's Chris Carabott gave the episode an 8.2 out of 10, praising Perrineau's performance and the flashback, but the website later ranked [...] "Adrift" [...] 80th out of the 115 Lost episodes, jokingly saying that the shark should have eaten Michael [...] "and <b>save</b> <b>us</b> a lot of 'Waaaaaalt!' and 'They took him. From my hands!' shout fests". A similar list by Los Angeles Times ranked the episode as the fourth worst of the series, describing it as [...] "boring". New York magazine listed [...] "Adrift" [...] in its [...] "Twenty Most Pointless Episodes of Lost", complaining about [...] "grinding the story to a halt" [...] and the [...] "plodding" [...] flashback, and saying that the episode would have been improved if Sawyer and Michael reached land faster.|$|E
