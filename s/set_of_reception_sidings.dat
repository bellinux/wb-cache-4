50|$|The {{marshalling}} yard takes up {{an area of}} 280 hectares, has a length of 7,000 metres and a maximum width of 700 metres. When it opened it had a total track length of 300 kilometres and there were six signal boxes, 825 <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> points, 100 home, 115 distant and 688 shunting signals. As a two-sided shunting facility, Maschen has two train formation yards. The north-south system has a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> 48 departure sidings and a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> 16 <b>reception</b> sidings; the south-north system consists <b>of</b> a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> 64 departure sidings and a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> 17 <b>reception</b> <b>sidings.</b> Both systems are supplemented by storage and marshalling sidings. In addition, there is an eight-road main repair shop for the repair of goods wagons and an engine shed {{for the maintenance of}} electric and diesel-driven goods train locomotives with a two-road inspection hall and numerous open-air storage sidings.Two signal boxes are responsible for the yard, one for each system. Separate signal boxes that had been built for the marshalling sidings were closed again in 1983.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} part of the Ring Railway was duplicated in 1903. The section from Nürnberg Hauptbahnhof via Dutzendteich and the marshalling yard to the Nuremberg-Augsburg line was electrified in 1935. For the construction of the Nazi party rally grounds in the area between Luitpoldhain, Dutzendteich and Langwasser, the connection from the marshalling yard to the Nuremberg-Regensburg line was moved by 1.6 km to the southeast in 1938. The original line ran from the western end <b>of</b> the <b>reception</b> <b>sidings</b> in an arc north to Zollhaus and the area of the swimming stadium and an area currently used for allotments, where the tracks separate to run towards Nürnberg Hauptbahnhof or the Nuremberg-Regensburg line. The new line connects at the eastern end <b>of</b> the <b>reception</b> <b>sidings,</b> then turns left and runs straight through today's district of Langwasser (formerly Märzfeld north and the SA camp south of the line) and, after crossing Gleiwitzer Straße, branches to connect with the Nuremberg-Regensburg line. Zollhaus station was moved to the new line and a new station was built as Märzfeld (now Nürnberg-Langwasser), which was expected to serve arriving and departing crowds for the annual Nazi Party celebrations.|$|R
5000|$|With a {{total length}} of over 1¼ miles, between Wath Central railway station and Elsecar Junction, and with over 36 miles of track this was two yards in one: Eastbound traffic was {{received}} in 8 <b>reception</b> <b>sidings</b> feeding 31 departure sidings {{and controlled by}} [...] "B" [...] Box, whilst for westbound traffic there was a fan <b>of</b> 9 <b>reception</b> <b>sidings,</b> again feeding 31 departure sidings and controlled by [...] "A" [...] Box. The western entry/exit to the yard was {{under the control of}} Elsecar Junction signal box whilst the eastern end was controlled by Moor Road signal box, with additional control from the Wath Central signal box, which controlled the main lines through the yard and was situated by the station. The yard could handle as many as 5,000 wagons per day.|$|R

50|$|East German {{television}} (DFF) was {{transmitted from}} the tower between 1969 and 1990. The first programme (DFF/DDR-FS/DDR1/DFF1) was on channel 10, with the second programme (DFF2/DDR2) broadcasting on channel 29 from 1972. DFF2/DDR2 broadcast in SECAM colour. This was deliberately different from the West German PAL standard, so East German residents could not watch West German broadcasts in colour. In practice, however, few East Germans owned colour <b>sets,</b> and <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> both standards was possible in black-and-white.|$|R
5000|$|The new Dominion of Canada {{acquired}} the territories of Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory from the Hudson's Bay Company in 1870. These territories {{were considered to}} have been settled by British colonists, and therefore the <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> English law was automatic. However, given {{the long history of}} control by the Hudson's Bay Company, there was some uncertainty as to the date <b>of</b> <b>reception.</b> To resolve this uncertainty, various statutes were passed to <b>set</b> the date <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> as July 15, 1870, the date of the transfer of these two territories to Canada. The Province <b>of</b> Manitoba <b>set</b> this date for the <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> English law for matters coming within provincial jurisdiction. The Legislature of the North-West Territories passed an Ordinance adopting the same date for matters coming within territorial jurisdiction. The federal Parliament eventually enacted a provision adopting this date for all matters in the North-West Territories.

40|$|This article {{looks at}} Britain’s {{response}} to the World Refugee Year (1959 – 60), {{and in particular the}} government’s decision to allow entry to refugees with tuberculosis and other chronic illnesses. In doing so, it broke the practice established by the 1920 Aliens’ Order which had barred entry to immigrants with a range of medical conditions. This article uses the entry of these sick refugees as an opportunity to explore whether government policy represented as much of a shift in attitude and practice as contemporary accounts suggested. It argues for the importance <b>of</b> <b>setting</b> the <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> tubercular and other ‘disabled’ refugees in 1959 – 61 in its very particular historical context, showing it was a case less of the government thinking differently about refugees, and more of how, in a post-Suez context, the government felt obliged to take into account international and public opinion. The work builds on and adds to the growing literature surrounding refugees and disease. It also places the episode within the specificity of the post-war changing epidemiological climate; the creation of the National Health Service; and the welfare state more broadly. In looking at the role of refugee organizations in the Year, the article also contributes to debates over the place of voluntary agencies within British society...|$|R

40|$|The {{long term}} goals {{of this project}} are to {{investigate}} statistical models for signals propagating in long-range underwater channels and to design signal processing techniques to mitigate signal fluctuations due to random disturbances such as internal waves. OBJECTIVES At long ranges, broadband <b>receptions</b> consist <b>of</b> early ray-like arrivals and a finale that is best {{described in terms of}} the low order modes. The energetic low mode signals are more strongly affected by internal wave scattering than the ray arrivals. By focusing on the low order modes, this project seeks to develop a better understanding of internal wave effects. The first objective of this project is to derive range-dependent mode statistics from experimental data obtained during the SPICE 04 and LOAPEX experiments. Using these statistics, the second objective is to develop a statistical model to describe the low mode signals as a function of range. The third objective of this project is to develop new robust signal processing techniques based on the derived random channel model. APPROACH To characterize internal wave effects on the modes, this project will use the extensive data <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> low-frequency <b>receptions</b> recorded {{as a part of the}} North Pacific Acoustic Laboratory (NPAL) project...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} achieve the {{aspiration}} for a capacity of 11,000 goods wagons per day, Maschen was equipped from the beginning with the most modern shunting technology available in the 1970s. The composition of incoming goods trains was transmitted to Maschen before they arrived, so that the hitherto usual practice of handing over the trains in the <b>reception</b> <b>sidings</b> could be done away with. Using the data, train-splitting lists were created, these formed the working basis for the sequence control unit (Ablaufsteuerrechner or ASR). The ASR controls the shunters on the hump yards by radio, giving them the shunting speeds, setting the points for the rolling goods wagons and regulating their speed with retarders, 26 bar-type (Balkengleisbremsen) and 112 rubber retarders being available. 112 wagon transporters (Beidrückanlagen) move the loose wagons onwards within the sidings.|$|R
40|$|The ocean geoacoustic inverse {{problem is}} the {{estimation}} of physical properties of the ocean bottom from a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> acoustic <b>receptions</b> in the water column. The problem is considered {{in the context of}} equipment and spatial scales relevant to naval sonar. This dissertation explores uncertainty, resolution, and regularization in estimating (possibly piece-wise) continuous profiles of ocean bottom properties from full-waveform acoustic pressure time-series in shallow-water experiments. Solving for a continuous solution in full-waveform seismic and acoustic problems is not in itself new. But analyses of uncertainty, resolution, and regularization were not included in previous works in this category of ocean geoacoustic problem. Besides quantifying the quality of individual inversion results, they also provide an important tool: Methods and details in these topics build to a pre-experiment design analysis based on the problem resolution, which can be estimated without measurements (i. e. before the experiment takes place). The resolution of the bottom inversion is calculated as a function of array configuration, source depth, and range. Array configurations include 40 -element horizontal line arrays (HLAs) from 200 - 1200 m long towed at 10 m depth, with source range defined as that to closest HLA element, and single and multiple vertical line array...|$|R
50|$|The Manchester-Sheffield-Wath {{electrification}} {{was extended}} {{into the yard}} in 1965 to allow electrically-hauled trains to the Manchester area to be handled. Seventeen miles of track from Woodburn Junction and Darnall Junction via Broughton Lane to the <b>Reception</b> <b>Sidings</b> at Catcliffe were electrified at 1500 V DC. The insulators were capable of being used at 6.25 kV AC if ever required, with the option of 25 kV AC with minimal conversion costs. Unlike similar electrified marshalling yards, to save on costs {{the main body of}} the sorting sidings was not electrified: a half of the arrival sidings was electrified for incoming electric trains; departing electric trains either had to use the southern third of the main sorting sidings (the western part of which were wired for electric trains) or had to be drawn out of the main sorting sidings by diesel locomotives into electrified departure roads where the electric locomotives were attached.|$|R

50|$|The station {{opened in}} February 1850 by the East and West Yorkshire Junction Railway. The station was {{situated}} {{close to the}} A59 bridge over the railway. The NER estimated that the local population was 374 and 4,405 ticket were sold, which was a decent number for the time. In 1913, the goods traffic handled at the station were livestock and 251 tons of barley. The goods facilities and coal depot were located west of the up platform with a small timber warehouse beside the crossing. When the Second World War began, a huge brick buildings was built northwest of the station, which was a refrigerated cold store where the Ministry of Food could house emergency meat. On completion, two private sidings were provided running {{on either side of}} the brick monolith and two loop <b>reception</b> <b>sidings.</b> In the summer of 1958 the services at the station were reduced to one in each direction.

5000|$|At {{the time}} of opening, the yard was {{handling}} 3,000 wagons a day. Incoming trains were split in the 11 <b>reception</b> <b>sidings,</b> propelled over the hump in the yard, from where the individual wagons rolled down a slope and were automatically sorted into new trains on the Yard's 50 main sorting sidings. The yard even had its own dedicated class of shunting locomotive (British Rail Class 13) for this purpose as BR's standard class of shunting locomotive was not powerful enough {{for use in the}} yard. [...] Each of the main sorting sidings was fitted with computer-controlled retarders to either slow the rolling wagons down before they hit other wagons already on the siding, or give wagons rolling too slowly a boost to move them along to the correct position in a particular siding. This wagon-control system, manufactured by Dowty, was very complex, needed almost constant maintenance, and crucially could not handle longer wheelbase wagons, which were already becoming more prevalent and required individual shunting. There was an express freight and departure yard of 10 sidings, and a 25 road secondary yard for local freight trains (with its own hump).|$|R

The rail connection to Southampton was important. At first the base was served by loading and unloading at Marlborough goods yard, but in mid-1943 work started on establishing a rail to road transfer site; the connection was located {{about half a mile}} (about 1 km) west of Hat Gate Cottage at a ground frame, and was commissioned on 18 August 1943. This had been the site of the 1933 connection between the M&SWJR and GWR lines. The siding ran north in three <b>reception</b> <b>sidings,</b> and then north-east in two mileage sidings, where the actual unloading took place.

50|$|On {{the basis}} of these three {{different}} programs, Glick has {{on a number of occasions}} attempted to theorize comparative receptions. The first was model <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> scientific ideas in peripheral countries along an active/passive axis. A passive reception is limited to local comments on the ideas, while in the active mode members of national disciplinary groups change their research programs and attempt in some way to participate in the new paradigm. The second model (written with Mark Henderson) looks at the cognitive structure of ideas as they are received, envisioning four modes <b>of</b> <b>receptions</b> (thetic, antithetic, corrective, and extensional). All of the examples are drawn from the three <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> ideas. The second model was an outgrowth of his classic course, “Darwin, Freud, and Einstein,” which he has taught yearly at Harvard Summer school since 1993. An address to the Catalan History of Science Society in 1992 addressed approaches to the comparative history of science in small countries, and the Normal MacColl Lecture at Cambridge University in 2000, which was a synthesis <b>of</b> the <b>receptions</b> <b>of</b> Darwin, Einstein and Freud in Spain, viewed in comparative perspective.|$|R
