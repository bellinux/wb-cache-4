40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the presence of long memory in sukuk yield spreads and forecast the future yield spreads for sukuk. Specifically, the focus is on the yield spread between Dow Jones Islamic Markets Index (DJIM) and the Malaysian Government Investment Issues (GII). The study uses monthly data on the DJIM Index and GII yields from 2005 : 08 to 2012 : 04. Data are <b>sourced</b> from <b>Bloomberg</b> database and Datastream. Using ARMA (autoregressive moving average) estimator method, the data are used to test the hypothesis that the yield spreads has long memory. The findings show no evidence that the yield spreads have long memory. Since yield spreads can serve as a leading indicator of economic conditions, the empirical estimator method used in this research has an implication for forecasting future yield spreads of Islamic debt market financial instruments...|$|R

40|$|MBA 2014 ABSTRACT The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) {{is widely}} used to {{estimate}} required equity returns to inform investment decisions. Significant empirical {{research has shown that}} the CAPM does not effectively predict the risk-return behaviour of portfolios of assets or individual assets on a number of different stock exchanges. The problem addressed here is the impact of errors in the CAPM on effective investment decisions, especially for single companies unable to diversify risk. Daily share price data for twenty companies on the JSE, as well as data for various JSE indices and government bonds, were <b>sourced</b> from <b>Bloomberg</b> for the period 1 January 2000 through 31 December 2012. The results show that the CAPM does not effectively predict the risk-return behaviour of the twenty companies considered here, and often leads to significant errors in the prediction of Net Present Value of an investment (by as much as 100...|$|R

In July 2015, <b>Bloomberg's</b> <b>sources</b> [...] "familiar with the matter" [...] declared there was an informal prohibition from the Kremlin for senior Russian officials from mentioning Navalny's name.

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} analyze the effect of GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, and volatility index on bond yield spread in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand compared to United States of America as a benchmark country. Beside that, this research also aimed to analyze causality among yield spreds of sample countries. This research comprises 10 -year sovereign bond with monthly data in period of 2006 – 2015. The whole variables in this research are monthly data including sovereign bond yield spread, GDP growth, inflation, interest rates, and volatility index. All data derived from different <b>sources</b> including <b>Bloomberg,</b> Asian Development Bank, and central bank. Method used in this research is Johansen cointegrating test, Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), and Granger causality test. This research has different results in each sample country. Inflation shows positive and significant effect on bond yield spread in Indonesia. It is the same with volatilitility index that volatility index has positive and significant effect on bond yield spread in all sample countires such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Meanwhile interest rates show negative and signfiicant effect on bond yield spread in Indonesia...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} evidence of the market volatility of Bursa Malaysia as a result of insider trading activities. The study used insider trading data of Bursa Malaysia <b>sourced</b> from <b>Bloomberg,</b> Singapore and I-capital Malaysia. The insider transactions involve filing made to Bursa Malaysia from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2008. The number of insider transactions totaled 5799 and originates from 70 KLCI component stocks. This study uses the GARCH model to evaluate the effect of insider trading on market volatility of Bursa Malaysia. The sum of alpha and beta from the GARCH results are computed to assess volatility persistency. The study indicates that 38 % of insider trades influences and affects market volatility. Knowing that insider trading is a criminal offence under the Malaysian security laws, in general 62 % of insiders will ensure that their trading does not affect the volatility of the market. Insiders might disguise their trading with stock pooling and friendly syndicates. A pattern has emerged in Bursa Malaysia that stock prices drop more violently, stock prices drop more than going up and there is a tendency for stock prices to drop more often. With this general observation, insiders will go for piggy-backing on insider trades and trading intensity...|$|R

In January 2008, CNN reported that a <b>source</b> close to <b>Bloomberg</b> said that the mayor had launched a research effort to assess his chances of winning a potential presidential bid. According to the report, the unidentified source also stated that Bloomberg had set early March as a timetable for making a decision {{as to whether or not}} to run. On January 16, 2008, it was reported that Bloomberg's business interests were placed in [...] "a sort of blind trust" [...] because of his possible run for the presidency.

3000|$|Of course, the {{beverage}} stock pair (KO-PEP) chosen {{in this study}} is just a representative for the purpose of numerical illustration. As the proposed method is data-independent, it can be applied in general by a trader who would select other pairs of stock-market data with similar volatility and that are typically highly correlated. The modified spread (SPR) between KO and PEP, set as [...] SPR [...] = [...] KO [...] - [...] PEP [...] - 30, is used in the filtering procedure. The adjustment coefficient of 30 was chosen solely for convenience of representation. For the real trading procedure, the spread [...] KO - PEP [...] is used. Note, that even with 30 as an adjustment, this does not result to negative values in the differences and the main characteristic of the data set is preserved. An attempt was made to find the rationale for the major spikes in [...] SPR [...]. No explanation, however, from data <b>sources</b> such as <b>Bloomberg</b> and the Internet can be found. The occurrence of spikes appear data-specific, and looking at the same time series of spread from 2002, the spikes happened again quite frequently.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} ‘merging’ financial tick data available from data <b>sources</b> such as <b>Bloomberg,</b> NSE, and Thomson Reuters etc. Different derivative securities are traded on the exchange with different frequencies in each unit of time such as second or minute in intraday trading, therefore, {{it is difficult to}} form ‘ordered pairs’, which are essential for any financial analysis, of tick data representing the simultaneous trades of the different derivative securities. Merging refers to the conversion of intraday tick data of different securities of varying frequencies, as provided by data sources, into the form in which the tick data of all traded derivative securities have same frequency, so {{that it is possible to}} form ordered pairs of data (in every unit time period) in such a way that the original nature of the data is preserved. 	 The four merging algorithms: Truncation, Weighted mean, median and all-combinations algorithm are compared with Dropdown algorithm, which is being used widely by the trading firms. Using NSE intraday tick data for various trading days, it is found that ‘Truncation’ and ‘Weighted Mean’ algorithms are more efficient merging algorithms. ...|$|R
