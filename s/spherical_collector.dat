The analysis is performed for the side-viewing 1 P 21 detector sensitized with sodium salycilate. To take advantage of the wide selection photomultipliers available in the end-on configuration, a scheme for converting the end-on types to a side viewing geometry with a response uniform over several degrees of detector rotation is developed.

40|$|Performances of ED-tethers {{using either}} spherical {{collectors}} or bare tethers for drag, thrust, or power generation, are compared. The standard Parker-Murphy model of current {{to a full}} sphere, with neither space-charge nor plasmamotion effects considered, but modified to best fit TSS 1 R results, is used (the Lam, Al'pert/Gurevich space-charge limited model will be used elsewhere) In the analysis, the <b>spherical</b> <b>collector</b> is assumed to collect current well beyond its random-current value (thick-heath). Both average current in the bare-tether and current to the sphere are normalized with the short-circuit current {{in the absence of}} applied power, allowing a comparison of performances for all three applications in terms of characteristic dimensionless numbers. The sphere is always substantially outperformed by the bare-tether if ohmic effects are weak, though its performance improves as such effects increase...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis study aims at {{numerical}} simulation of nanoparticle transport in flue-gas treatment at a waste incineration plant. The {{purpose of this}} work is to assess the effect of temperature, particle size, and fluid velocity on nanoparticle transport around a single <b>spherical</b> <b>collector</b> considered as a filter medium for nanoparticles filtration. Thus, the stochastic Langevin equation was {{used to describe the}} dynamic behavior of particles with account for different forces acting simultaneously on these particles, namely, drag force, gravitational force, and Brownian force. The results indicated, on the one hand, that the effect of temperature on the nanoparticle movement increases with temperature and, on the other hand, that the fluctuation of the particle trajectory is a significant factor in decreasing the particle diameter. Concerning the effect of the fluid velocity, the role of the nanoparticles trajectory becomes more significant the higher the value of the fluid velocity. The results of this work which are expressed as the bivariate velocity and displacement distribution function aim at understanding the experimental filtration efficiency studied in laboratory conditions at two different temperatures and fluid velocities...|$|E
40|$|The {{transport}} and deposition of colloidal particles in saturated porous media are processes of considerable importance in many fields {{of science and}} engineering, including the propagation of contaminants and of microorganisms in aquifer systems {{and the use of}} micro- and nano-particles as reagents for groundwater remediation interventions. Colloid transport is a peculiar multi-scale problem: pore-scale phenomena and inter granular dynamics have an important impact on the larger-scale transport. In this thesis a microscale approach was used {{to gain a better understanding}} of the mechanisms underlying colloidal processes, such as deposition and aggregation. The research activity was carried out by performing numerical simulations through the FEM software, COMSOL Multiphysics®. The first part of the study focuses on the development of a new correlation equation to predict single collector efficiency, a key concept in filtration theory, which allows predicting particle deposition on a single <b>spherical</b> <b>collector.</b> By performing Eulerian and Lagrangian simulations in a simple geometry and by using an innovative approach to interpret the results, a new correlation equation to predict single collector efficiency has been formulated. A hierarchical approach to interpret the results was exploited. The proposed correlation equation presents innovative features, such as the validity for a wide range of parameters (also at very small Peclet numbers), the prediction of efficiency values always lower than unity, the total flux normalization and the analysis of the mutual interactions between the main transport mechanisms (advection, gravity and diffusion) and the steric effect. The final formula was also extended to include porosity and a reduced model was proposed. The second part of the study focuses on more realistic systems, characterized by a column of spherical collectors in series. The numerical simulations performed show the limits of the existing models to interpret the experimental data. Therefore, a more rigorous procedure to evaluate the filtration processes in presence of a series of collectors was develope...|$|E

40|$|Defining {{the removal}} {{efficiency}} of a filter {{is a key}} aspect for colloid transport in porous media. Several efforts were devoted to derive accurate correlations for the single-collector removal efficiency, but its upscaling to the entire porous medium is still a challenging topic. A common approach involves the assumption of deposition being independent {{of the history of}} transport, that is, the collector efficiency is uniform along the porous medium. However, this approach was shown inadequate under unfavorable deposition conditions. In this work, the authors demonstrate that it is not adequate even in the simplest case of favorable deposition. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations were run in a vertical array of 50 identical <b>spherical</b> <b>collectors.</b> Particle transport was numerically solved by analyzing a broad range of parameters. The results evidenced that when particle deposition is not controlled by Brownian diffusion, nonexponential concentration profiles are retrieved, in contrast with the assumption of uniform efficiency. If sedimentation and interception dominate, the efficiency of the first sphere is significantly higher compared to the others, and then declines along the array down to an asymptotic value. Finally, a correlation for the upscaled removal efficiency of the entire array was derive...|$|R
40|$|Electrodynamic {{tethered}} systems, {{in which}} an exposed portion of the conducting tether itself collects electrons from the ionosphere, promise to attain currents of 10 A or more in low Earth orbit. For the first time, another desirable feature of such bare-tether systems is reported and analyzed in detail: Collection by a bare tether is relatively insensitive to variations in electron density that are regularly encountered on each revolution of an orbit. This self-adjusting property of bare-tether systems occurs because the electron-collecting area on the tether is not fixed, but extends along its positively biased portion, and because the current varies as collecting length to a power greater than unity. How this adjustment to density variations follows from the basic collection law of thin cylinders is shown. The effect of variations in the motionally induced tether voltage is also analyzed. Both power and thruster modes are considered. The performance of bare-tether systems to tethered systems is compared using passive <b>spherical</b> <b>collectors</b> of fixed area, taking into consideration recent experimental results. Calculations taking into account motional voltage and plasma density around a realistic orbit for bare-tether systems suitable for space station applications are also presented...|$|R

The trajectory equations of motion are solved alternately with Poisson's equation for the potential field until convergence is achieved. A direct (noniterative) numerical technique is used to obtain the solution to Poisson's equation. Space charge effects are included for initial current densities as large as 100 A/sq cm. Ways of dealing successfully with the difficulties associated with these high densities are discussed. A description of the mathematical model, a discussion of numerical techniques, results from two typical runs, and the FORTRAN computer program are included...|$|R
40|$|Abstract - We have {{compared}} performances in LEO of a bare tether and a tether using a <b>spherical</b> anodic <b>collector,</b> for common values of length L and cross-section area A. The standard space-charge limited model of current {{to a full}} sphere, with neither magnetic nor plasma-motion effects considered (i. e., the Alpert-Gurevich-Pitaevskii model), is used. The bare tether would have a thin tape cross-section shape. Currents are normalized with the short-circuit current {{in the absence of}} applied power, allowing a comparison of performances for all three applications in terms of characteristic dimensionless numbers. For a light deorbit mission (L = 4 km, A = 1 mm 2) the sphere would need a radius of about 8 m for its tether to achieve the drag exerted by the bare tape. For a heavy deorbit mission (L = 20 km, A = 5 mm 2), the sphere would need a radius about 20 m; on the other hand, a sphere of radius 2 m would exert a drag 10 times smaller than the bare tape. For both power generation and thrusting, differences in performances are not that extreme for tether systems involving, for thrusting, a power-supply, and, for power generation, a chemical rocket (to balance the Lorentz drag) ...|$|R
30|$|Scalar {{underwater}} irradiance {{was measured}} with a high-resolution spectroradiometer (SR- 9910, Macam Photometrics Ltd. Livingston, Scotland) equipped with a 10 -m light guide and a <b>spherical</b> light <b>collector</b> of 0.7 cm diameter. Successive underwater scans at depth intervals between 5 and 50 cm down to a maximum depth of 3 m were done around noon and {{used to calculate the}} diffuse spectral attenuation coefficients, Ko (λ) (Smith, 1968). Thereby, each underwater scan took less than 2 min plus 1 min to adjust to the next depth. To determine surface irradiances, the spectroradiometer was connected to a cosine-corrected light collector and the full spectra (250 to 800 nm) was recorded in spectral sampling intervals of 2 nm every 5 min between 4 a.m. and 10 p.m. For the time intervals (< 2 h) when the spectroradiometer was used for underwater scans, the incident irradiance had to be interpolated {{with the help of a}} parallel running cosine-corrected PAR sensor (Li 193 SA, LiCor Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) measuring surface irradiance continuously. For 2 days of the spring campaign, the spectroradiometer was not available. For these days, all PAR values refer to these LiCor readings, while UVR values were provided by the field station Zingst from ELDONET-readings [47], calibrated versus the above described spectroradiometer. The distance between the sampling site around Hiddensee and coastal field station Zingst is about 30 km.|$|R
40|$|The {{combination}} of a 10. 6 μm main pulse CO 2 laser and a 1064 nm pre-pulse Nd:YAG laser in EUV source concepts for HVM would require collector mirrors with an integrated spectral purity filter that suppresses both laser wavelengths. This paper discusses a new approach of a dual-wavelength spectral purity filter to suppress 10. 6 μm and 1064 nm IR radiation at the same time. The dual-wavelength spectral purity filter combines two binary phase gratings that are optimized for 10. 6 μm and 1064 nm, respectively. The dual phase grating structure has been realized on <b>spherical</b> sub-aperture EUV <b>collector</b> mirrors having an outer diameter of 150 mm.

40|$|Abstract - Deorbit, power generation, and {{thrusting}} {{performances of}} a bare thin-tape tether and an insulated tether with a <b>spherical</b> electron <b>collector</b> are compared for typical conditions in low-Earth orbit and common values of length L = 4 − 20 km and cross-sectional {{area of the}} tether A = 1 − 5 mm 2. The relative performance of moderately large spheres, as compared with bare tapes, improves but still lags as one moves from deorbiting to power generation and to thrusting: Maximum drag in deorbiting requires maximum current and, thus, fully reflects on anodic collection capability, whereas extracting power at a load or using a supply to push current against the motional field requires reduced currents. The relative performance also improves as one moves to smaller A, which makes the sphere approach the limiting short-circuit current, and at greater L, with the higher bias only affecting moderately the already large bare-tape current. For a 4 -m-diameter sphere, relative performances range from 0. 09 sphere-to-bare tether drag ratio for L = 4 km and A = 5 mm 2 to 0. 82 thrust–efficiency ratio for L = 20 km and A = 1 mm 2. Extremely large spheres collecting the short-circuit current at zero bias at daytime (diameters being about 14 m for A = 1 mm 2 and 31 m for A = 5 mm 2) barely outperform the bare tape for L = 4 km and are still outperformed by the bare tape for L = 20 km in both deorbiting and power generation; these large spheres perform like the bare tape in thrusting. In no case was sphere or sphere-related hardware {{taken into account in}} evaluating system mass, which would have reduced the sphere performances even further...|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} and deposition of colloidal particles in porous media are important phenomena involved in many environmental and engineering problems as, for instance, {{the use of}} micro- and nanoscale zerovalent iron, a promising reagent {{in the field of}} groundwater remediation [1]. Particle {{transport and}} deposition in the proximity of injection or pumping wells and in porous media in general may also be relevant in other fields of chemical and petroleum engineering. Mathematical models able to predict particles transport and deposition in porous media are often needed in order to design field applications. The basic concept of these models is the single collector efficiency η, which predicts particles deposition onto a single grain of a complex porous medium in terms of probability that an approaching particle would be retained on a solid grain. Many different approaches and equations exist in the literature, however most of them are valid only under specific conditions (eg. specific range of flow rate, particle size, etc.), and predict, for certain parametric conditions, efficiency values exceeding unity, which is, for an efficiency concept, a contradiction [2][3]. The objectives of this study are to analyze the causes of the failure of the existing models in predicting the deposition rate in certain conditions and to modify the definition of collector efficiency {{in order to have a}} more general equation. The definition of collector efficiency, first proposed by Yao at al. [4], is based on the particles deposition onto a <b>spherical</b> grain (the <b>collector)</b> in an infinite domain. It is defined as the ration between the flux of particles that deposit on the grain and the total amount of particles that could reach the collector by advective flux from an area equal to the projection of the spherical grain itself. In the present work Yao's model has been implemented by COMSOL Multiphysics and solved with an Eulerian approach; particles deposition simulations were run. From these results a new definition of η is proposed, considering all the flux that potentially reach the collector. A new equation, valid in a broader range of parameters (eg. low Pe number, big particle size, etc.), has been formulated starting from the numerical result...|$|R
