40|$|Today’s bonded {{composite}} repairs {{rely heavily}} on manually grinding. The human influence on scarf tolerances and consequently on assembly and structural performance can be reduced by automating the process of scarf manufacturing. A process based on contact free surface scanning, surface reconstruction, automated repair design and automated milling of the repair scarf is presented. A machine and software design for validation purposes is described. Several repair specific design considerations relevant {{for the construction of}} a mobile <b>scarfing</b> <b>machine</b> are discussed. The redesign of a standard 3 -axis milling machine to a mobile automated scarfing unit is presented and the architecture of the associated software framework described. An outlook to future validation steps is given...|$|E
40|$|The {{scarfing}} processing {{experiment was}} carried out for a steel slab moving at a constant speed with the scarfing torch fixed. The temperature histories inside the slab were recorded by two sets of thermocouples in different depths. A two-step computational model of heat transfer in scarfing processing has been developed in FLUENT. The model features in detail heat conduction from both the hot slag coating and the scarfing reaction to the steel slab surface, and it solves for steady state heat advection in the Step- 1 model followed by the Step- 2 model of transient heat transfer calculation. The combination of these two steps is able to give the complete prediction of a temperature history of 122. 2 sec. The temperature predictions agree well with the experimental measurements. The high temperature region (1100 oC ~ 1500 oC) {{is found to be}} mainly located in a depth of 0. 5 mm near the slab surface. The fraction of heat conducted from the hot slag coating into the slab is 5. 4 % while that from the scarfing reaction is 10. 3 %. The simulations clearly explain the measurements and suggest practical implications. Section II. Background Scarfing processing has been used widely to remove surface defects from steel and other semi-finished as-cast products for over 70 years. The first automated <b>scarfing</b> <b>machine</b> used in production was built and installed in 1935. Steel slabs produced from continuous casting often exhibit surface defects, including inclusions, pits and cracks, such as shown in Fig. 1. In order to obtain advanced high strength steels (AHSS) for automotive parts or other high-quality-products, these surface defects should be avoided during the casting process or removed during post-processing using the scarfing technique...|$|E
50|$|Slabbing Mill {{transforms}} ingots into slabs {{by rolling}} them in its 1250 mm Universal Four-High Mill. The rolling {{capacity of the}} Mill is 4 MT per annum. The shop has Hot and Cold <b>Scarfing</b> <b>Machines</b> and 2800 T Shearing Machine.|$|R
50|$|Skiving or <b>scarfing</b> <b>machines</b> cut {{material}} off in slices, usually metal, {{but also}} leather or laminates. The process {{is used instead}} of rolling the material to shape when the material must not be work hardened, or must not shed minute slivers of metal later which is common in cold rolling processes.|$|R
30|$|All joints {{were tested}} in the Shimadzu AG–X test {{equipment}} (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), with a 100  kN load cell. For the DCB and <b>scarf</b> tests, the <b>machine</b> was in the generic configuration to perform tensile tests. For the ENF tests, it was adapted to apply a three-point bending flexure loading. The equipment is connected to a data acquisition system that records the test time, applied load and grips’ displacement. These values {{will be used to}} plot the P–δ curves and perform all required data analysis. All the tests were carried out under conditions of room temperature and humidity. The test velocity was 1  mm/min. Five specimens were tested for each condition.|$|R
50|$|On 9 December 1941 in Malaya, {{near the}} Siam border, all {{available}} aircraft {{had been ordered}} to make a daylight raid on Singora (where the Japanese Army was invading), in Siam. Squadron Leader Scarf, {{as leader of the}} raid, had just taken off from the base at Butterworth when enemy aircraft swept in destroying or disabling {{all the rest of the}} <b>machines.</b> <b>Scarf</b> decided nevertheless to fly alone to Singora. Despite attacks from roving fighters he completed his bombing run and was on his way back when his aircraft became riddled with bullets and he was severely wounded, his left arm had been shattered, he had a large hole in his back and was drifting in and out of consciousness. He managed to crash-land the Blenheim at Alor Star, without causing any injury to his crew, and was rushed to hospital where he died two hours later.|$|R
40|$|Scarf joints are an {{effective}} method of bonding thick composite laminates for {{applications such as}} the repair of composite aircraft structures. However, concerns remain about their damage tolerance characteristics. Typically composite scarf repairs to aircraft structures require use of hand tools or rudimentary jigs. If the scarf is incorrectly prepared, this may cause a profile deviation to the joint, affecting the bond line stresses and in turn, reducing the residual strength of the joint or repair. The subject of this work examined the sensitivity of composite <b>scarf</b> joints to <b>machining</b> profile deviation and artificial disbond, when subject to static tensile load. Tensile test specimens were prepared with two different configurations of scarf for representing an undercut or imprecise scarf typical of a machining error. In addition, sensitivity of the scarf joints {{in the presence of}} an artificial disbond was also tested. Results indicated that for the specimens tested, the scarf is relatively insensitive to minor profile deviation, but highly sensitive to an artificial disbond. Experimental results were also compared with finite element analysis...|$|R
