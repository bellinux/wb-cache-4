The FCC issued a $2.3 million fine to Comcast after finding that the company was charging customers for unordered services and equipment. More than a thousand customers issued complaints about these unprecedented charges to their bill.

25|$|In August 1990, Commander, U.S. Seventh Fleet was {{deployed}} to Bahrain {{in order to}} serve as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command (ComUSNAVCENT) following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Since ComUSNAVCENT operated from onboard ship, he established NAVCENT-Riyadh as a staff organization to provide continuous Navy representation at United States Central Command headquarters. This mission was assigned initially to Commander, Carrier Group Three. During succeeding months, the NAVCENT-Riyadh staff was augmented substantially but remained small, relative to the United States Army Central and CENTAF staffs. In November, the NAVCENT-Riyadh command was transferred from COMCARGRU 3 to Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 5. This change resulted in the Navy flag officer at NAVCENT Riyadh's remaining relatively junior to other <b>Service</b> <b>representatives,</b> particularly the Air Force.|$|E
25|$|In November 1981, a {{finalized}} {{version was}} distributed {{to all of}} NA for approval, and the text was approved with a 2/3 majority required for passage. After passage, however, publication was held up due to a spirited disagreement between the World Service Office and the members who wrote the book regarding a few key sentences which described {{the nature of the}} World Service Organization and other NA service entities. The book was printed in 1983 with the passages removed. A second edition that restored the passages quickly followed at the demand of the fellowship. A hasty vote which required Regional <b>Service</b> <b>Representatives</b> to respond within 60 days (even though most regions only met every 90 days) making it impossible to actually poll the NA Groups and membership again removed the sentences in a third edition.|$|E

25|$|An ASC {{is made up}} of all the {{participating}} NA Groups in a given Area. The Group <b>Service</b> <b>Representatives</b> (GSRs) and alternate GSRs from each Group in an Area meet regularly together for a business meeting where issue are raised and discussed in order to better {{meet the needs of the}} groups in the Area. Each ASC elects its own officers: the chairperson, vice chairperson, secretary, treasurer, and regional committee members (RCMs). Frequently an ASC will have various subcommittees (such as a but not limitied to Hospitals and Institutions (H), Public Information (PI), Activities, Website, Outreach, Policy, Literature, Literature Review, Newsletter, Recovery By Mail and Convention) which are led by subcommittee leaders that are elected by the entire ASC. In some regions, several ASCs will be grouped into a Metropolitan Service Committee at the sub-regional level; this is typical in especially large cities, like Los Angeles, that contain multiple ASCs.|$|E

500|$|In the 1990s CSG {{introduced}} the ACSR (Advanced Customer Service Representative) system. An extension to ACSR called ProfitNow! {{was introduced in}} 2003. ProfitNow! used a consumer's account data to advise customer <b>service</b> <b>representatives</b> on {{the likelihood of a}} caller cancelling their service or buying a new product. It was later turned into an online system with a user interface similar to Microsoft Windows at CSG.net. CSG purchased the Kenan FX software from Lucent Technologies in 2002. Kenan software managed billing and ordering and provided middle-ware to help various customer service and billing products integrate with each other. CSG NextGen was introduced for international markets, with support for multiple languages. In March 2014, CSG added a cybersecurity suite to its product portfolio, under the name CSG Invotas. The company released CSG Ascendon, a digital platform for communications service providers, in March 2015. The platform uses content monetization and delivery systems without making excessive changes to existing infrastructure. In November 2015 the Invotas unit was spun off into a separate entity. [...] Invotas was acquired by FireEye in a transaction that closed February 1, 2016.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{extension}} to the SOA model {{by adding a}} new component called a <b>Service</b> <b>Representative.</b> This SOA component, which simulates an enterprise agent, is modeled by a generic software agent and stays at the client site to be employed by different service providers. Moreover, different types of web services are required to model actual services in the business domain. Consequently, we propose to categorize business services into Information, Knowledge, and Task services. While a service client calls an information service to receive processed data, a knowledge service provides enterprise knowledge for either the service client or <b>service</b> <b>representative.</b> However, a <b>service</b> provider can assign a task to the <b>service</b> <b>representative</b> to process the client’s data locally. In this paper, we introduce a prototype implementation of the extended SOA model {{that we used to}} develop a healthcare enterprise system which offers different types of services...|$|R

500|$|Krasinski and Helms {{appeared}} in fewer episodes {{in order to}} film several upcoming movies. Helms was temporarily written out of the series with a storyline that saw his character travel to the Caribbean with his brother on a boat. As such, Helms made only a small appearance in [...] "The Whale" [...] and was absent from the following eight episodes. He returned in the episode [...] "Couples Discount". According to TVLine, he returned to work right before the show's Christmas break. Wilson was initially slated to appear in only 13 episodes before leaving for a planned Dwight-centric spin-off, but the spin-off was not picked up by NBC. Mindy Kaling and B. J. Novak have much lesser roles as Kelly Kapoor and Ryan Howard, respectively. Both Kaling and Novak {{appeared in}} the season opener [...] "New Guys", and both returned for the series finale. Actress Catherine Tate, who joined the series as a series regular midway through season eight portraying Nellie Bertram, continued with the series.

As a result, [...] customer <b>service</b> <b>representatives</b> (CSR) have seen an increase in training, quality assurance monitoring has significantly increased, and a customer satisfaction survey is offered to random callers.|$|E

2500|$|Customer {{service is}} the {{provision}} of service to customers before, during and after a purchase.

Customer service concerns the priority an organization assigns to customer service relative to components such as product innovation and pricing. Strip clubs are profit-oriented businesses like restaurants and other retail establishments. Performers and staff are the primary customer <b>service</b> <b>representatives</b> in the club environment. Dancers are their primary vehicle to entice customers to spend time and money in the establishment.|$|E
2500|$|A {{large number}} of Periscope streams were used to {{broadcast}} the fight, either indirectly {{with a focus on}} reactions from viewing parties, or simply rebroadcasting television feeds of the fight.

ESPN's Ryan McGee dubbed Periscope the [...] "winner" [...] of the fight due to the prominence it received through this manner. Dick Costolo, CEO of microblogging service and Periscope parent company Twitter, made a similar remark; although it was initially assumed to be in reference to the illegal streams, he clarified that it was actually in reference to HBO's usage of the service to stream behind-the-scenes from the fighters' locker rooms.|$|E

In April 2016, it introduced an API for developers to build chatbots into Messenger, for uses such as news publishers building bots to give users news through the service, and in April 2017, it enabled the M virtual assistant for users in the U.S., which scans chats for keywords and suggests relevant actions, such as its payments system for users mentioning money.
