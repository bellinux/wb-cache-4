40|$|The {{purpose of}} this interim staff {{guidance}} (ISG) is to clarify the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) staff guidance for review of Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) Designs using a Gas Turbine Driven <b>Standby</b> <b>Emergency</b> Alternating Current (AC) Power system. This ISG, while providing new staff guidance on the topic, also revises and updates the guidance previously provided in the cited Standard Review Plan (SRP) sections below related to the subject <b>Standby</b> <b>Emergency</b> AC Power System. Background Emergency diesel generators (EDGs) are widely used as the <b>standby</b> <b>emergency</b> power sources for the onsite AC power system. It is anticipated that new reactor designs will incorporate gas turbines to supply the <b>standby</b> <b>emergency</b> AC power system. This ISG provides guidance on the implementation of emergency gas turbine generators (EGTGs) used as AC power sources to supply power to safety-related equipment or equipment important to safety for all operational events and during accident conditions. Only EGTG systems that are air cooled and diesel oil fueled are considered in this guidance. This ISG provides new guidance for applicants submitting a combined license (COL) or design certification (DC...|$|R

Currently, the lake serves as a <b>standby</b> <b>emergency</b> water supply. For this reason, visitors are asked to observe certain necessary regulations to keep the waters pure. There are also blooms of toxic blue-green algae in the lake {{during the summer and}} fall that make contact with the water dangerous.|$|R

40|$|The risk {{of malaria}} {{increases}} with {{the duration of}} stay. Long-term travelers {{need to know the}} risk of malaria and the effective measures to reduce this risk: personal protective measures against mosquito bites and chemoprophylaxis. The use of insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets and window screens should be emphasized. When chemoprophylaxis is indicated it should be prescribed at least for the first 3 to 6 months. Then, alternative strategies can be discussed with the traveler: continuous chemoprophylaxis, seasonal chemoprophylaxis and/or <b>standby</b> <b>emergency</b> treatmen...|$|R

50|$|In 1974, American Jet Industries {{started work}} on a seven-seat {{executive}} transport with a Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6 engine in the nose supplemented by a Williams Research Corporation WR19-3-1 turbofan mounted in the tail. The turbofan was originally {{intended to be a}} <b>standby</b> <b>emergency</b> power unit that could also be used if extra thrust was needed for take-off. The prototype designated Hustler 400 (N400AJ) first flew on January 11, 1978. The Hustler was a low-wing cantilever monoplane with retractable tricycle landing gear, and a high-mounted tailplane.|$|R
40|$|Travellers to malaria-endemic {{destinations}} {{are at risk}} {{of significant}} disease and, sometimes, death. Current malaria protection strategies, including chemoprophylaxis, can never be completely effective. In some cases, protective measures are discontinued or misapplied while the risk of infection still exists. In others, suboptimal measures are used, or even no measures at all, because of poor information or inappropriate risk-benefit assessment. In very rare cases, inexplicable failure of prophylaxis occurs. If malaria is contracted whilst abroad the danger to the individual is often further compounded by a lack of high-quality medical facilities and an uncertain supply of effective drugs for treatment. The advent of newer, well tolerated, drugs for treating malaria provides an opportunity to review the role of <b>standby</b> <b>emergency</b> self-medication in travellers visiting or staying (for work or other reasons) in areas where there is a risk of contracting malaria. This article was prepared following a meeting convened in London on Africa Malaria Day in 2002, in which the current opinions of experts in travel medicine and specifically malaria were discussed. It reviews opinion on the current effectiveness and acceptance of prevention strategies, as well as the role of <b>standby</b> <b>emergency</b> medication for falciparum malaria.

40|$|The {{issue of}} <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting</b> is quite {{complicated}} and meeting all standard requirements are often very complex. Rapid {{development in the}} field of LED light sources has brought new possibilities in the design of <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting.</b> In particular, LED has a higher power output in comparison to conventional light sources used in <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting</b> and also the size of LED is smaller. Another advantage is the possibility of optimal routing of LED diodes by means of suitable optics depending on the areas and the type of <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting.</b> Measurements were performed on a prototype of autonomous emergency lamp, which does not use a conventional battery as a source of energy, but super-capacitor. Especially {{from the perspective of a}} long lifespan, its fast charging and reducing of dependence on temperature, the super-capacitor seems like very reliable replacement of batteries previously used...|$|R

25|$|Police {{used to have}} blue-colored <b>emergency</b> <b>lights</b> {{but after}} a recent restock of vehicles, now the use of both blue and red color is usual.

Regulation also states that the Military as well as vehicles carrying politicians can make use of a single rotating blue light at the roof. Every other individual and/or company may use yellow lights for either warning or emergency. Special groups like Emergency Response teams and agents may also include <b>emergency</b> <b>lights</b> on their private vehicles {{in case of an}} emergency when not in active duty. All utility vehicles such as construction related, tow trucks must be equipped with a yellow-colored <b>emergency</b> <b>light</b> bar on the top, clearly visible from the front and rear side. The same applies for private security firm vehicles, that are in generally treated like typical private cars.|$|R
