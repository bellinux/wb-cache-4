5000|$|Transfers of {{property}} were originally by <b>symbolic</b> <b>delivery,</b> by handing over {{a clump of}} ground or a stone or similar object on the property itself, and then registering the [...] "deed of conveyance" [...] in the local [...] "Register of Sasines". Actual sasines on the land itself were made unnecessary {{by an act of}} 1845. The [...] "instrument of sasines" [...] was superseded by the recording of the conveyance with a [...] "warrant of registration" [...] by an act of 1858.|$|E
50|$|In March 1916, {{the ocean}} liner Pr√≠ncipe de Asturias from Barcelona was wrecked 90 miles from Rio de Janeiro. In this accident, more than 450 people {{died and the}} load of marble {{ornaments}} and brass that composed the statuary of the monument {{was lost in the}} depths of the ocean. The following year, replicas were requested for those lost in the shipwreck. Finally, May 25, 1927 the count of Amalfi, on behalf of the king Alfonso XIII, made a <b>symbolic</b> <b>delivery</b> of the work to the president Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear.|$|E
50|$|The gift must be {{delivered}} to the donee. If the gift is of a type that cannot {{be delivered}} in the conventional sense - a house, or a bank account - the delivery can be effected by a constructive delivery, wherein a tangible item allowing access to the gift - a deed or key to the house, a passbook for the bank account - is delivered instead. <b>Symbolic</b> <b>delivery</b> is also sometimes permissible where manual delivery is impractical, such as the delivery of a key that does not open anything, but is intended to symbolize the transfer of ownership.|$|E
40|$|The {{delivery}} means {{the transfer of}} possession of property from one person, seller, to another, buyer. The seller delivers goods to buyer if he delivers them physically, if he makes <b>symbolic</b> <b>delivery</b> by delivering document of title to them (e. g. a bill of landing) or other means of control over them (e. g. the keys of warehouse {{in which they are}} stored), or if a third party who is holding them acknowledges that he now holds them for the buyers. In constructive delivery, the seller agrees that he holds the goods on behalf of the buyer his possession of the goods under a hire-purchase agreement and becomes owner on making the final payment. Goods may be 'pledged' (or 'pawned'). In this case the pledge (pawnee) acquires possession of them. The delivery of possession in the case of pledge, may be physically and symbolic on the same way as transfer of property. The difference is the constitutum possessorium delivery...|$|E
