40|$|Abstract. <b>Sealed</b> {{radioactive}} <b>sources</b> of 22 Na for positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS), {{free from}} the legal regulations, are commercially available from an American company. However, thick foils are used to seal 22 Na in these sources and large fractions of the positrons annihilate in the sealing materials. Further, it is pointed out that a long lifetime component over 1 ns appears in the positron lifetime spectrum acquired with the Kapton <b>sealed</b> <b>source</b> (POSK- 22, IPL Inc.). In this research, {{attempts were made to}} develop high quality <b>sealed</b> positron <b>sources,</b> potentially free from regulations, for ubiquitous application of PALS.

40|$|<b>Sealed</b> <b>sources</b> are small, {{relatively}} high-activity radioactive sources typically encapsulated in {{a metallic}} container. The activities {{can range from}} less than 1 mCi to over 1, 000 Ci. They are used {{in a variety of}} industries and are commonly available. Many of the sources will be classified as Greater-Than-Class C low-level radioactive waste (GTCC LLW) for the purpose of waste disposal. The US Department of Energy is responsible for disposing of this class of low-level radioactive waste. To better understand the scope of the GTCC LLW situation regarding <b>sealed</b> <b>sources</b> and to provide data to a model that projects future quantities of GTCC material, data from a comprehensive 1991 US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) survey and a related 1992 survey of Agreement States were analyzed to estimate the number, volume, and activity of Potential GTCC <b>sealed</b> <b>sources</b> currently available from specific licensees.

40|$|Environmental hazards can {{be caused}} by radio-active waste after disposal. It is, therefore, {{important}} that safety assessment methodologies be developed and established to study and estimate the possible hazards, and institute safety methodologies that will prevent the evolution of these hazards. Spent <b>sealed</b> <b>sources</b> are a specific type of radioactive waste. According to the IAEA definition,[1] spent <b>sealed</b> <b>sources</b> are unused sources because of activity decay, damage, misuse, loss, or theft. Accidental exposure to humans from spent <b>sealed</b> <b>sources</b> can occur at the moment they become spent and before their disposal. Because of this reason, safety assessment methodologies have been tailored to suit the management of spent <b>sealed</b> <b>sources.</b> To provide an understanding of and confidence in this study, validation analysis was undertaken by considering the scenario of an accident that occurred in Egypt, June 2000 (the Meet-Halfa accident from an iridium- 192 source).
