500|$|Hoffman {{explained}} {{the key to}} his changeup was how he pinched the seam of the ball with his thumb and index finger as he released it. He threw the changeup with the arm speed used to throw a fastball, and the spin and movement of the ball looked the same to the batter. His changeup ranged from 73–76mph. Bruce Bochy, who managed Hoffman for over a decade with the Padres, said of Hoffman's changeup: [...] "He pitched so well off his fastball [...] couldn't just sit on it every pitch." [...] "You could be sitting on [...] and still not be successful with it", <b>says</b> <b>former</b> player Mark Sweeney. It was the arm action on the change up and the late sink just before it reached the plate that allowed Hoffman to stay successful over the years. With opponents flailing to slow down their swings, teammates nicknamed Hoffman's changeup The Bugs Bunny Pitch after a famous Bugs Bunny cartoon episode. [...] "Some [...] fool you. Some guys overpower you. Hoffman embarrasses you", said former rival and later teammate Mike Piazza. After striking out on a changeup to end the game against Hoffman, Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said, [...] "It's like it has a parachute on it." [...] As Hoffman lost velocity on his fastball throughout his career, he compensated by maintaining a notable speed differential between that pitch and his changeup. He initially kept the grip of his changeup a secret. [...] "I was a little weird about it", Hoffman said. [...] "I didn't like talking about how I threw the change. I didn't want people to see how I gripped the ball. I thought I'd be giving away something to the hitters." [...] Later in his career, he posed for pictures of his grip, figuring everyone had seen it.|$|E
