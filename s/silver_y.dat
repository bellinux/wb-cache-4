500|$|The archipelago's {{isolation}} {{has resulted}} in a lack of biodiversity. The most successful colonists with nearly two hundred species are the flies followed by beetles with approximately 140 species. There are no bees on the islands so the flies are probably important pollinators of plants. One beetle, the rare and endangered weevil, Ceutorhynchus insularis, [...] is known from only Dùn and the Westmann Islands, an archipelago off the south-west coast of Iceland. Less than one hundred species of butterfly and moth occur, compared to 367 recorded on the Western Isles. Red admiral (Vanessa atalanta) and painted lady (Vanessa cardui) are two of only seven species of butterflies, both well known and common migrants. Common summer moths are the antler (Cerapteryx graminis), dark arches (Apamea monoglypha) and the migrant <b>silver</b> <b>Y</b> (Autographa gamma). One unusual moth recorded is the least carpet (Idaea rusticata), an occasional migrant, and in the UK, usually recorded in the south-east of England. On 4 September 2014 a rare vagrant oleander hawk-moth (Daphnis nerii) was recorded. Oleander is not found in the UK every year, and the larva have never been recorded in the Britain.|$|E

40|$|SERS as a probe for {{adsorbate}} orientation on <b>silver</b> nanoclusters <b>Y.</b> Fleger,a,b ∗ Y. Mastai,b,c M. Rosenbluha,b and D. H. Dresslerb,c Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy {{has been}} used to characterize multilayers of three isomeric aromatic compounds adsorbed on silver nanoclusters. The three structural isomers, all of which adsorb in the carboxylate form onto the silver nanoclusters, bind in two different geometries to the silver surface. Different molecular configurations correlate to differences inbondingstrengthof thesemolecules to thesilver surface,whichcanbeprobedbySERS. Forortho-hydroxybenzoic acid (salicylic acid), we observed red shifts of major SERS peaks in comparison to the normal Raman vibrations of nonadsorbed crystalline material. For this molecule the steric hindrance between the adjacent carboxylate and hydroxyl groups causes the carboxylate group to rotate from the common flat geometry of benzene substituents on surfaces and bond directly through one of the oxygen atoms to the surface. In this case, strong coordinative bonding between the carboxylate group and themetal surface causes the red shifts in the SERS peaks. For para-, andmeta-hydroxybenzoic acid, the steric hindrance is less likely since the two functional groups are not at adjacent positions, and therefore these molecules adsorb on the silver surface in a totally flat geometry. For these molecules, in contrast to the ortho isomer, the CO 2 interacts with the surface through an extended π bond, and thesemolecules are physically adsorbed in the common flat position. Therefore, for themeta and para substituents, we do not observe significant red shifts in the SERS spectrum. Copyright c © 2009 JohnWiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the risks, cost, size, implications, and likely {{outcomes of the}} Year 2000 or &quot;Y 2 K &quot; Problem, {{as well as the}} lessons learned, opportunities, and <b>silver</b> linings of <b>Y</b> 2 K projects. The MIS academic community has largely missed a unique opportunity to be relevant to practitioners as well as our communities. Fortunately, it is not too late since knowledgeable and rational voices are needed to help communities, and the people and enterprises in them, intelligently deal with the challenges of Y 2 K. Strangely, in spite of billions of bytes of data about year 2000 problem appearing each week, we still know surprisingly little about the reality of the Y 2 K risks we face. And there is little chance that a complete assessment of even the greatest risks faced by our enterprises and communities can be made, let alone repairs completed. Then there are the global risks of Y 2 K, and the thorny fact that most Y 2 K risks are beyond our direct control anyway. So what can ethical, conscientious, and concerned MIS professionals do about this situation? How can we help our communities reduce risks, appropriately plan for contingencies, and quickly manage failures? With only a few months to go, this may be the last chance we have to be relevant, enhance our collective credibility, and genuinely help improve IS practices...|$|R
40|$|Sub-micronic {{particles}} are of considerable interest {{for a wide}} variety of applications, such as catalyst or optical ceramics, due to their unique properties determined by size, composition and structure. In this work, we have reported a simple, rapid, single-step aerosol processing for the continuous synthesis of nanostructured particles having homogeneous composition and narrow size distributions, good crystallinity and fluorescence response. This paper presents the synthesis, optimization and characterization of hybrid Ag@Y 2 O 3 :Eu (9 at. % Eu 3 +) phosphor particles by means of spray pyrolysis method from water solutions of common nitrates precursors. The effect of silver concentration on particle structure, morphology and functional properties was specially evaluated. The as-prepared samples were additionally heated from 800 to 1200 °C/ 12 h under constant argon flow to avoid the silver oxidation. It was evident the cubic phase with Ia- 3 symmetry as the principal one in all as-prepared and thermally treated samples. For the case high silver nitrate concentrations in precursor solutions a minority crystalline phase having Fm 3 m symmetry was identified. The luminescence emission spectra have been taken after excitation at 235 nm wavelength. It is evident the increase in the emission caused by the presence of metallic <b>silver</b> nanoparticles onto <b>Y</b> 2 O 3 :Eu 3 + particle surface.

40|$| mercados de crédito (ASPs) y adaptando el modelo de Garbade <b>y</b> <b>Silver</b> (1983) a este segmento de los mercados de crédito. En primer lugar presentamos un modelo teórico de LFP basado en agentes para los mercados de ASPs, bonos y CDSs que permite la participación simultánea de los agentes en distintos mercados. Posteriormente, contrastamos teóricamente dicho modelo y obtenemos que antes de la crisis (escenario de alta liquidez) el mercado de CDSs lidera al mercado de ASPs en el proceso de LFP. Este resultado cambia tras la aparición de la actual crisis de forma que durante dicha crisis (escenario de baja liquidez) el mercado de ASPs lidera el proceso de LFP. Resultados similares se obtienen cuando comparamos el mercado de CDSs y el mercado de bonos. La diferencia en la liquidez relativa entre los mercados de CDSs y ASPs/bonos nos ayuda a explicar e interpretar estos resultados. Extendemos nuestro análisis para contrastar la teoría de que la prima de crédito del ASP es una medida de riesgo de crédito más adecuada que la prima de crédito del bono. Nuestros resultados indican que la prima de crédito del ASP lidera, de forma consistente, a la prima de crédito de los bonos hasta el punto que siguiendo la terminología de Garbade <b>y</b> <b>Silver</b> (1983) obtenemos que la prima de crédito del bono es un "satélite puro" de la del ASP. En tercer lugar, analizamos la integración interna (dentro de un mercado) y externa (entre mercados) de tres mercados europeos de crédito a nivel corporativo (bonos, {{asset swap}} {{packages}} y credit default swaps corporativos) en el contexto de la actual crisis financiera. Para tal fin, empleamos un modelo DCC-GARCH para las innovaciones de cada mercado que {{a su vez}} se obtienen tras extraer de las primas de crédito el efecto de los fundamentales de las entidades subyacentes. Nuestra medida de la integración interna del mercado se basa en la media de los DCCs existentes entre la innovación de una prima de crédito individual (específica de la empresa) y las innovaciones correspondientes a la prima de crédito media del mercado. De igual forma, nuestra medida de la integración externa del mercado se basa en la media de los DCCs existentes entre las innovaciones de dos primas de crédito individuales de la misma empresa pero correspondientes a distintos mercados. De esta forma, cuanto mayor es la correlación de las innovaciones, mayor es la integración de los mercados. Nuestros resultados muestran que los cambios en las primas de crédito se deben en gran medida a innovaciones específicas de las empresas y en un menor grado a cambios en los fundamentales. La integración interna del mercado aumenta durante la crisis para el caso del mercado de CDSs pero decae para el caso de los bonos y ASPs. La integración externa del mercado entre el mercado de CDSs y los otros dos mercados disminuye durante la crisis. Estos hechos sugieren que el mercado de CDSs tiende a seguir su propio camino de forma considerable en épocas de crisis financiera. El grado de integración interna y externa se ve afectado de forma significativa por factores de liquidez y riesgo global. Finalmente, estudiamos el impacto de un hipotético bono soberano común en la Unión Monetaria Europea (UME) que a su vez daría lugar a un tipo de interés libre riesgo común en la Unión Monetaria Europea. Un posible bono común europeo ha atraído el interés de la prensa financiera y está recibiendo una atención creciente de los reguladores. Sin embargo, hasta la fecha no se dispone de ninguna cuantificación de este tipo de interés libre de riesgo común al igual que no se ha realizado una comparación detallada con otras posibles alternativas. Este estudio trata ambas cuestiones y presenta una estimación de este tipo de interés libre de riesgo común para los países de la UME durante el periodo de 2004 a 2009 usando variables que vienen motivadas de un modelo teórico de selección de cartera. Así, en primer lugar analizamos los determinantes de los diferenciales de las rentabilidades de los bonos soberanos en la UME y encontramos un efecto significativo de las variables referentes a la calidad crediticia, situación macro, correlación, liquidez y términos interacción. Estos resultados se ven confirmados gracias a distintos tests de robustez en los que se emplean otras frecuencias en los datos, distintos bonos de referencia (benchmarks), otras alternativas para las variables relacionadas con el riesgo y la liquidez, regresiones de sección cruzada, paneles balanceados y diferentes vencimientos. A partir de estos resultados, presentamos una estimación del tipo de interés libre de riesgo que estaría libre, al menos hasta cierto punto, del efecto de factores de riesgo (crédito, liquidez, macro, correlación) que influyen sobre el diferencial de los bonos soberanos individuales. Por último, encontramos evidencia a favor de la hipótesis de que un bono común y por tanto de un tipo de interés común en la UME propiciaría ahorros substanciales referentes al coste de nanciación de la deuda para todos los países involucrados. Por supuesto, existen muchos aspectos relacionados con el diseño institucional que deberían resolverse (prioridad relativa a otros bonos, cantidad relativa al total de la emisión, fondo de garantía, etc.) antes de que dicho bono común empezara su andadura. Sin embargo, nuestro estudio ofrece una primera aproximación a una cuestión fundamental. Mercado de productos derivados; Mercado de renta fija;...|$|R
