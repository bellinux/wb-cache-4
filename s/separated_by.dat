The Poldens are a low narrow ridge of Blue Lias with {{alternating}} bands of limestone and clay. Because {{of the nature of the}} Levels and Moors, the Poldens have a significant visual impact.|$|E

5|$|A {{cladistic}} {{study of}} the skeletal and bone morphology of the classical Pelecaniformes and relatives found that the frigatebirds formed a clade with Limnofregata. Birds of the two genera have 15 cervical vertebrae, unlike almost all other Ciconiiformes, Suliformes and Pelecaniformes, which have 17.

5|$|A {{visually}} striking {{effect is}} seen every March and September as an unusual shadow occurs around the equinoxes. A shadow appears to descend the west balustrade {{of the northern}} stairway. The visual effect is of a serpent descending the stairway, with its head at the base in light. Additionally the western face points to sunset around 25 May, traditionally the date of transition from the dry to the rainy season. The intended alignment was, however, likely incorporated in the northern (main) facade of the temple, as it corresponds to sunsets on May 20 and July 24, recorded also by the central axis of Castillo at Tulum.. The two dates are <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> 65 and 300 days, {{and it has been}} shown that the solar orientations in Mesoamerica regularly correspond to dates <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> calendrically significant intervals (multiples of 13 and 20 days).|$|E
5|$|Among the actinides, thorium and uranium are {{the easiest}} to isolate.

5|$|Another {{potential}} source of lithium is the leachates of geothermal wells, which are carried to the surface.

5|$|Contador faced {{repeated}} {{challenges from}} Riccardo Riccò and Danilo Di Luca in the race's final week. They were <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> {{less than a}} minute after stage 15, and though Di Luca would falter slightly in the Giro's second individual time trial, the time gap among the three of them was just 21 seconds heading in to the Giro's final mountain stage. Di Luca faltered further in that last mountain stage, losing almost five minutes and any chance to repeat as Giro champion, but Contador and Riccò finished together and were <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> only four seconds going into the Giro's final stage, another individual time trial. Contador's superior time trial skills provided the difference in the Giro's finale. Though he finished 11th on the stage, he gained almost two minutes over Riccò, winning the Giro overall without taking any individual stage.|$|E
