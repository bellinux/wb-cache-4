The I/NI call offers a solution to the main problem of high dimensionality when analyzing microarray data by selecting genes which are measured with high quality.

We describe a simple approach to compute the <b>signal</b> <b>variance</b> in registered images based on the <b>signal</b> <b>variance</b> and covariance of the original images, the spatial transformations computed by the registration procedure, and the interpolation or approximation kernel chosen. Our approach is applied to diffusion tensor (DT) MRI data.

By exploiting such emissions, electromagnetic analysis (EMA) is performed with EM probes to extract secret information from these devices. Owing to the locality of EM emissions, namely, secret information may leak from multiple locations around cryptographic devices, {{it is difficult}} to determine the exact location before conducting an EMA. In this paper, <b>signal</b> <b>variance</b> of EM emissions during encryption is proposed to identify the information leakage of unprotected and protected cryptographic modules. We prove that <b>signal</b> <b>variance</b> is an equivalent metric to Difference of Means (DoM). Thus, by computing the higher signal variances based on near-field scan, the data-dependent EM emissions are disclosed, namely, the leakage locations are found. In addition, a small and low-cost probe is made to verify the proposed EMA on application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementations. The experiment on AES PPRM 1 implementation indicates that misjudgments of leakage are reduced, and the accuracy is improved 48. 6 % compared with existing methods. Moreover, the experiment of EMA against AES WDDL implementation shows that <b>signal</b> <b>variance</b> is also effective in exposing the leakage locations in the presence of countermeasures.

It is unique among existing targeted observing strategies in that it attempts to predict the reduction in forecast-error variance associated with each deployment of targeted observations. To achieve this, the ET KF predicts the variance of ‘signals ’ for each feasible deployment, where a signal represents the difference between two forecasts, initialized with and without the targeted observations. For linear forecast-error evolution, the <b>signal</b> <b>variance</b> is equal to the reduction in forecast-error variance, provided that observation- and background-error covariances are accurately specified and identical to those produced by the operational data-assimilation scheme.
