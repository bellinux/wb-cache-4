After a few more minutes of accurate fire, Chui A-poo's fleet scattered and three junks were abandoned by their crews, most of whom drowned as their vessels were sunk around them. Towards the end of the engagement, shots from the Columbine hit one of the larger junks and it exploded, <b>sending</b> <b>up</b> a large plume of smoke. Ten junks escaped the battle due to the British who chose not to continue the chase for they had an idea about where the brigands were going.

25|$|The second {{portion of}} the show, called the olio, was {{historically}} the last to evolve, as its real purpose was {{to allow for the}} setting of the stage for act three behind the curtain. It had more of a variety show structure. Performers danced, played instruments, did acrobatics, and demonstrated other amusing talents. Troupes offered parodies of European-style entertainments, and European troupes themselves sometimes performed. The highlight was when one actor, typically one of the endmen, delivered a faux-black-dialect stump speech, a long oration about anything from nonsense to science, society, or politics, during which the dim-witted character tried to speak eloquently, only to deliver countless malapropisms, jokes, and unintentional puns. All the while, the speaker moved about like a clown, standing on his head and almost always falling off his stump at some point. With blackface makeup serving as fool's mask, these stump speakers could deliver biting social criticism without offending the audience, although the focus was usually on <b>sending</b> <b>up</b> unpopular issues and making fun of blacks' ability to make sense of them. Many troupes employed a stump specialist with a trademark style and material.|$|E

As soon as those troops began to descend from a slight rise, they were engaged by German field and heavy artillery. The brigade kept going to the second objective, although part of the advance remained bogged down short of the first objective. The 10th Brigade of the 3rd Australian Division, suffered many losses from machine-guns in pillboxes.

500|$|Grossmith {{took to the}} {{professional}} stage in 1870 with a sketch called Human Oddities, written by his father, and a song called [...] "The Gay Photographer" [...] (that is, the [...] "carefree" [...] photographer). The song, with words by Grossmith's father and music by young Grossmith, concerns a photographer who broke {{the heart of a}} young lady named Miss Jenkins; so she drank his chemicals and died. In late 1870, the younger Grossmith appeared on his own with a nightly spot at the [...] "old Polytechnic" [...] in Regent Street, where comic sketches alternated with scientific and serious lectures for the entertainment of the public.

Biographer Tony Joseph notes that, except for a few early pieces, nearly all of Grossmith's material was written and composed by Grossmith himself. [...] Joseph describes the sketches as [...] "a light-hearted <b>sending</b> <b>up</b> of various aspects of contemporary life and manners. ...he was the complete performer... as a pianist (he performed for the most part sitting at a piano)... as a raconteur... as a mimic, facial expression, timing—he had it all.

500|$|According to Gracey, {{a number}} of critics have {{compared}} Argento with the character of Peter Neal, speculating that he serves as an alter-ego for the director. Gracey refers to Tenebrae as a [...] "reflexive commentary on [...] earlier work." [...] The director himself saw the film in the same light, claiming it was a reaction to accusations that [...] " [...] was a misogynist... a criminal... a murderer." [...] Argento resolved to include all of these aspects of his previous films into Tenebrae. A scene {{in which a woman}} criticizes the lead character's books as [...] "sexist", featuring [...] "women as victims, cipers, male heroes [...] macho bullshit" [...] echoes criticisms of Argento's own work. Kim Newman calls the confrontation scene [...] "essentially autobiographical", and refuting these accusations Argento said that his films were instead an attempt to tackle his dark side, to [...] "let it speak". With Tenebrae in particular, he felt he was making a joke or playing a game with his critics, creating a front or mystique about himself. Rostock also believes Argento is having fun and <b>sending</b> <b>up</b> this perception. Newman agrees that Argento used Tenebrae to address his own public image, the notion that someone who creates art as [...] "sick and twisted" [...] as his, must himself be sick and twisted.

500|$|Attempts by the 4th and 11th Canadian Infantry Brigades to {{eliminate}} an enemy salient between Cité St. Élisabeth and Lens on 17 August failed and {{as had been}} foreseen the Germans continued to mount determined counter-attacks. The German command {{began to realize that}} the Canadian and British artillery would need to be neutralized before a counter-attack could succeed. The Germans began a series of counter-attacks against a chalk quarry under Canadian control outside of Cité St. Auguste but also sought to wear down the Canadian artillery resources by <b>sending</b> <b>up</b> false flare signals or provoking the infantry to call for unnecessary artillery fire. The Germans also began to use poison gas in earnest. From [...] the new Yellow Cross shells containing the blistering agent sulfur mustard were fired in addition to an undetermined number of shells containing diphosgene. The Canadian 1st and 2nd Artillery Field Brigades and the Canadian front line were heavily gassed. Many artillery men became casualties after gas fogged the goggles of their respirators and they were forced to remove their masks to set the fuses, lay their sights and maintain accurate fire. The Germans used the cover of gas to make a number of attempts against the Canadian controlled chalk quarry and Chicory Trench on the night of [...] 17 August and early morning of 18 August. All attempts against the chalk quarry failed and only one company of the 55th Reserve Infantry Regiment (on loan to the 11th Reserve Division) managed to breach the Canadian defences at Chicory Trench before being repulsed. German troops employing flamethrowers managed to penetrate the Canadian line north of the quarry on the morning of 18 August before being driven out.|$|E
