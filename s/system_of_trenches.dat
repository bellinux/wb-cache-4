5|$|The Battle of Sharon {{began on}} 19 September with a Western Front style {{bombardment}} during which {{two thirds of}} the mainly ground based heavy artillery, supported by the firepower of two destroyers pounded Ottoman positions, while one third of the heavy artillery fired creeping barrages to cover the infantry assaults. The XXI Corps infantry attacked simultaneously along the front line from the Mediterranean coast where the 60th Division, launched an attack on the western coastal section of the front line defended by the Eighth Army's XXII Corps. During this Battle of Tulkarm the 60th Division breached the front and second line trenches to eventually capture Tulkarm, the site of the Eighth Army headquarters. On their right, the main Tabsor <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>trenches</b> held by the Ottoman XXII Corps was attacked and eventually captured during the Battle of Tabsor, by the 3rd (Lahore), 7th (Meerut), and the 75th Divisions. These three divisions subsequently advanced, despite the Ottoman XXII Corps being reinforced, to capture Et Tire and Masudiye Station. In the process of the battles for Tulkarm and Tabsor the 7th (Meerut) and 60th Divisions created a gap in the front line, for the Desert Mounted Corps to ride through. They rode north and eastwards to the rear to capture the defending Ottoman armies' lines of communication. The right flank of the attacking XXI Corps was protected from the Eighth Army's Asia Corps, by the 54th (East Anglian) Division and the French Colonial Détachment Français de Palestine et de Syrie holding and pivoting on the Rafat salient, during the Battle of Arara as the infantry battle progressed.|$|E

Seeing a number of Ottoman soldiers retiring, Brigadier General Fitz J. M. Edwards (commanding 179th Brigade) ordered the attack to be launched at 13:35, before the 180th Brigade could get into position, so the 179th Brigade suffered heavy artillery and machine gun fire. The 2/18th and 2/19th Battalions, London Regiment (180th Brigade) and the 2/13th and 2/16th Battalions, London Regiment (179th Brigade) launched the attack, with one additional brigade in close support.|$|R
25|$|The {{plan for}} the attack at Rafa the next morning, 9 January, was a {{repetition}} of Chauvel's successful encirclement attack at Magdhaba.

25|$|Knowing {{that the}} Mahdists were closing in, Gordon finally ordered the {{strengthening}} of the fortifications around Khartoum. The city was protected to the north by the Blue Nile and to the west by the White Nile. To defend the river banks, he created a flotilla of gunboats from nine small paddle-wheel steamers, until then used for communication purposes, which were fitted with guns and protected by metal plates. In {{the southern part of}} the town, which faced the open desert, he prepared an elaborate <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>trenches,</b> makeshift Fougasse-type land mines, and wire entanglements. Also, the surrounding country was controlled by the Shagia tribe, which was hostile to the Mahdi.|$|E

Chauvel's attacking force was deployed early in the morning with the Yeomanry Mounted Division on the left, the 53rd (Welsh) Division in the centre south west of Tel el Khuweilfe, with the 4th Battalion Imperial Camel Brigade at Ras en Naqb and the 2nd Battalion holding the right. On the left of the Yeomanry Mounted Division, the line was continued by the 74th (Yeomanry) Division and the 60th (London) Division, which were to attack Sheria. The 10th (Irish) Division, which was to attack the Rushdi <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>trenches</b> and the Hareira redoubt, was on their left, continuing the line westwards.|$|E

25|$|The mobile army {{immediately}} started {{to invest the}} fortress. Work was begun on a line of field works that ran {{in front of the}} fortress, with its endpoints on the Sambre river, cutting the fortress off from overland access. Two batteries were placed on the main approaches to the town, and work on a second, countervailing, <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>trenches</b> was prepared. The Hereditary Prince made the chateau of Bousies his headquarters, and the Austrian auxiliaries (Hungarians, Serbs and Croats), destined to do the spadework for the entrenchments, built a camp in the forest of Mormal. After 20 April the preparations for the intended bombardment progressed slowly as the mobile army had to provide troops for the operations of the other Coalition forces that were needed to deflect French attempts at relief of the fortress (8,000 men on 22 April alone). Those attempts at relief were defeated by the Coalition in the Battles of Villers-en-Cauchies and Beaumont-en-Cambresis. Sorties by the garrison also hindered the preparations.|$|E
25|$|PLAN, {{the armed}} wing of SWAPO, was a guerrilla army and {{therefore}} {{did not have}} a traditional command and control structure. As such, it is impossible to determine a composition of units inside Cassinga. According to TRC findings, a self-defence unit posted at Cassinga consisted of approximately 300 male and female PLAN cadres (other source: approximately 300 to 600). The military section of Cassinga was easily partitioned from the non-military sections. The overall commander of PLAN in town was Dimo Amaambo, who responsible for the co-ordination of all PLAN actions in Southern Angola, including incursions into South West Africa/Namibia. A headquarters such as Cassinga was second in importance only to Lubango, which was the overall SWAPO military headquarters in Angola. Aside from the <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>trenches</b> and bunkers, defensive equipment included two ZPU-4 14.5mm anti-aircraft guns, one ZU-23-2 23mm gun, and around one or two ZSU 12.7mm guns. These were capable of being used in a ground attack role.|$|E

They were to assault the western end of the Tabsor defences, between a wadi west of Tabsor and the Wadi Hurab el Miske, on the right of the 60th Division's advance. Once these objectives had been captured, they were to advance and capture a second <b>system</b> <b>of</b> <b>trenches</b> defending Et Tire without artillery support, as the guns would be out of range and {{in the process of being}} moved forward.|$|E

500|$|During {{the first}} five months of World War I, the German attack through Belgium into France had been repulsed outside Paris by French and British troops at the Battle of the Marne in early September 1914. The Germans fell back to the Aisne valley, where they {{prepared}} defensive positions. In the subsequent Battle of the Aisne, the Allied forces were unable to push through the German line, and the fighting quickly degenerated into a stalemate; neither side was willing to give ground, and both started to develop fortified <b>systems</b> <b>of</b> <b>trenches.</b> To the north, on the right of the German army, there had been no defined front line, and both sides quickly began to try to use this gap to outflank one another. In the ensuing [...] "Race to the Sea", the two sides repeatedly clashed, each trying to push forward and threaten the end of the other's line. After several months of fighting, during which the British forces were withdrawn from the Aisne and sent north into Flanders, the northern flank had developed into a similar stalemate. By November, there was a continuous front line running from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier, occupied on both sides by armies in prepared defensive positions.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} experimental and numerical investigation of hydrodynamics and heat exchange with transversal flow past a two-dimensional trench without separation. The trench {{is placed on}} the flat plate and heated according to the law of qw=const. For experimentation a subsonic low-turbulent open-type aerodynamic tunnel was used. Mean velocity and temperature profiles have been obtained experimentally in different sections of tunnel above the single transversal cylindrical trench (stream-wise size s= 37. 5 mm, depth h= 2. 5 mm, h/s= 0. 067) with an external flow velocity of 18 m/s. Incompressible two-dimensional RANS (Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations) approach with two-parametrical k-ɛ and k-ω (MSST) turbulence models has been used in ANSYS FlUENT computational research. The paper explores an impact <b>of</b> <b>trench</b> shape and geometry on the structure, turbulent boundary layer, drag friction, heat exchange and pressure on a streamlined surface. It has been shown that calculations with k- ε  turbulence model constitute a match with experimental data. Thus, k- ε  turbulence model should be used for the low turbulent (ɛ 2 %) flow calculations. Surface profiling with a <b>system</b> <b>of</b> transversal <b>trenches</b> leads to increasing heat-transfer coefficient without raising surface drag friction.
