5|$|The second arc is {{the story}} of Larc and Sierra—brother and sister dragoons who serve {{different}} dragon masters and fight on opposite <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> war for power. Larc serves the dragon Drakonis, who wants to kill the other three dragons so that he can rule the world. Larc blackmails the game's protagonist to help him in this quest. Sierra, a dragoon for Vadise the White Dragon, wants to stop Drakonis without hurting her brother Larc. In the end, Drakonis is defeated again and banished to the underworld, and Larc is killed.|$|E

An isochromosome 12p (the short arm of chromosome 12 on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> centromere) is present in about 80% of the testicular cancers, and also the other cancers usually have extra material from this chromosome arm through other mechanisms of genomic amplification.|$|E
25|$|An {{isosceles}} triangle has {{two sides of}} equal length. An {{isosceles triangle}} also has two angles of the same measure, namely the angles opposite to the two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> length; this fact is {{the content of the}} isosceles triangle theorem, which was known by Euclid. Some mathematicians define an isosceles triangle to have exactly two equal sides, whereas others define an isosceles triangle as one with at least two equal sides. The latter definition would make all equilateral triangles isosceles triangles. The 45–45–90 right triangle, which appears in the tetrakis square tiling, is isosceles.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} , Mamdani claims {{the two types}} of rule were each <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> coin. He {{explains}} that colonialists did not exclusively use one system of rule over another. Instead, European powers divided regions along urban-rural lines and instituted separate systems of government in each area. Mamdani refers to the formal division of rural and urban natives by colonizers as the “bifurcated state.” Urban areas were ruled directly by the colonizers under an imported system of European law, which did not recognize the validity of native institutions. In contrast, rural populations were ruled indirectly by customary and traditional law and were therefore subordinate to the “civilized” urban citizenry. Rural inhabitants were viewed as “uncivilized” subjects and were deemed unfit to receive the benefits of citizenship. The rural subjects, Mamdani observed, had only a “modicum of civil rights,” and were entirely excluded from all political rights.|$|E

25|$|The West Japan Railway Company is {{very strict}} {{when it comes}} to punctuality, and commuters often depend on near-perfect timing on the part of trains to commute to and from work on time. This is because at {{stations}} (including the derailed train's next scheduled stop at Amagasaki Station) trains meet on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> platform to allow people to transfer between rapid and local trains running on the same line. As a result, a small delay in one train can significantly cascade through the timetable {{for the rest of the}} day due to the tightness of the schedule. Immediately after the rail crash occurred, some of the mass media pointed to the congested schedule of the Fukuchiyama Line as an indirect factor. In fact, cumulative changes over the previous three years had reduced the leeway in the train's schedule from 71 to 28 seconds over the 15minutes between Takarazuka and Amagasaki stations.|$|E

500|$|In {{her efforts}} to vividly {{describe}} the condition of women within society, Wollstonecraft employs several different analogies. She often compares women to slaves, arguing that their ignorance and powerlessness places them in that position. But at the same time, she also compares them to [...] "capricious tyrants" [...] who use cunning and deceit to manipulate the men around them. At one point, she reasons that a woman can become either a slave or tyrant, which she describes as two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> coin. Wollstonecraft also compares women to soldiers; like military men, they are valued only for their appearance. And like the rich, women's [...] "softness" [...] has [...] "debased mankind".|$|E
500|$|Alfredson has {{described}} the casting process as {{the most difficult part}} of making the film. He had particular concerns about the interaction between the two leads, and the fact that those who had read the book would have a preconceived notion of how the characters were supposed to look. He wanted the actors to look innocent, and be able to interact in front of the camera. They were supposed to be [...] "mirror images of each other. She is everything he isn't. Dark, strong, brave, and a girl. (...) Like two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> coin." [...] On another occasion, Alfredson stated that [...] "asting is 70 percent of the job; it's not about picking the right people to make the roles. It is about creating chords, how a B and A minor interact together, and are played together." [...] In the end, Alfredson expressed satisfaction with the result, and has frequently lauded Hedebrant and Leandersson for being [...] "extremely intelligent", [...] "incredibly wise", and [...] "unprecedentedly fantastic." ...|$|E

500|$|Modern productions, {{including}} those in an updated context, have been generally well received. Describing the 2004 Glyndebourne pairing with The Miserly Knight as [...] "flip <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> coin", reviewer Edward Seckerson in The Independent found the Schicchi performance [...] "a triumph of ensemble directing and playing, ... wickedly observed, sharp, focussed and funny". The New York Times gave a positive review to the Woody Allen 2008 production, which {{is set in a}} crowded tenement in which the boy Gherardino is practising knife thrusts. However, the critic questioned Allen's altered ending, in which Schicchi is stabbed by Zita as he addresses the audience. Los Angeles Times critic Mark Swed deemed Allen's production one of the top ten moments in classical music for 2008, and applauded it for [...] "hilarious wit and engaging musicality". Allen Rich of Variety praised the piece, though he disliked Allen's idea of beginning the opera with a montage of old film clips, with credits featuring mock-Italian names.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the start}} of her career Koda has been writing the lyrics to her songs.

The single was originally intended to be a single song about [...] "happy love", however Koda felt the melody had represented both the elements of happiness and sadness. She wrote the lyrics for both songs to represent the sadness and the happiness. In doing so Koda ended up creating two songs with the same melody. She remarked, [...] "It was a first time experiment for me, but I was able to convey how happiness and sadness are two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> coin." [...] Koda lists Janet Jackson, Christina Aguilera, and Beyoncé Knowles as her inspirations; she has also stated that when she produces, she [...] "is like a different person"; thus, she refers to herself in the third person and [...] "looks at [...] objectively".|$|E
500|$|VanAirsdale {{cited the}} release date and {{screening}} {{as the third}} and fourth reasons; he said there was confusion about what day the film was going to debut in theaters, and that Toronto is [...] "a nation removed from the audience where the film's actual momentum had been accruing for at least a month" [...] and that [...] "this rarely works for early fall releases; not because news doesn’t travel, obviously, but because it peels away a layer of accessibility that accompanies New York and L.A. bows." [...] The final reason, he attributed to the critics, believing that the fusion of horror and teen comedy confused some of them. He mentioned Ty Burr's review in particular, and stated that the film could perhaps have used more horror and been funnier, but that the film is [...] "ultimately a movie about two teenage girls' misadventures in victimization" [...] and that [...] "he jokes are virtually incidental to the friction imposed on women who happen to be two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> coin.

500|$|The {{earliest}} known {{depictions of}} the death or murder of Troilus are on shield bands {{from the turn of}} the 7th into the 6th century BC found at Olympia. On these, a warrior with a sword is about to stab a naked youth at an altar. On one, Troilus clings to a tree (which Boitani takes for the laurel sacred to Apollo). [...] A crater contemporary with this shows Achilles at the altar holding the naked Troilus upside down while Hector, Aeneas and an otherwise unknown Trojan Deithynos arrive in the hope of saving the youth. In some depictions Troilus is begging for mercy. On an amphora, Achilles has the struggling Troilus slung over his shoulder as he goes to the altar. Boitani, in his survey of the story of Troilus through the ages, considers it of significance that two artifacts (a vase and a sarcophagus) from different periods link Troilus' and Priam's death by showing them on the two <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> item, {{as if they were the}} beginning and end of the story of the fall of Troy. [...] Achilles is the father of Neoptolemus, who slays Priam at the altar during the sack of Troy. Thus the war opens with a father killing a son and closes with a son killing a father.|$|E
500|$|Tim Byrd {{reviewed}} the adventure in The Space Gamer No. 30, stating that it [...] "successfully combines fantasy with SF" [...] {{and that it}} was [...] "extremely fun to play [...] one of the best modules TSR has published". Two gaming magazines reviewed Expedition to the Barrier Peaks in 1981. Reviewer Marcus L. Rowland said in White Dwarf #26 that he found the adventure [...] "very enjoyable, with ideas and creatures eminently suitable for wider use". He gave it 9/10 overall, but complained that some of the maps were printed on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> sheet, making them useless as a Dungeon Master's shield (a visual barrier that allows dice rolls and other activities to be conducted without the players knowing the outcome). He recommended at least a week's study by the Dungeon Master before attempting to play it. He also notes that the cover [...] "reveals the secret of the creatures". Kirby Griffis {{reviewed the}} adventure in The Space Gamer #36. Griffis noted that it is full of [...] "surprises and new monsters", and felt that its one drawback was that Gygax presented standard D monsters as natives of other planets. In summary, he found it interesting and [...] "full of spice and flavor"; recommending it to anyone interested in [...] "something new" [...] or wanting to include science fiction in their D game.|$|E

[...] Mahone {{has been described as}} [...] "intellectually matched with Scofield", mainly in his ability to analyze and interpret his surroundings. Craig Blanchard of The San Diego Union-Tribune describes Michael as the [...] "brains of the operation" [...] and Mahone as his [...] "arch-nemesis, sort of his equal {{on the other side of}} the law."

And you just proved it. You can't kill. And that's what it's gonna take to stop me. Because I don't have the same reservations. I can." [...] His willingness to commit murder in order to preserve his life is shown when Michael asks if he would kill two innocent men to [...] "get his life back", to which he replies [...] "Absolutely."
