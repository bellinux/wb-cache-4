40|$|M. Com. (Taxation) The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the desirability of the implementation of a system of self-assessment in South Africa. The current system has several shortcomings and self assessment might be an improvement. Several of the developed countries have already gone onto self-assessment systems. These countries include The United States of America, Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom. A self-assessment system The Margo Commission recommended a self-assessment system in their report on the tax structure of South Africa. They motivated this recommendation as follows: "Under a system of self assessment, taxpayers would perform functions which are at present being discharged by assessors. With that responsibility shifted from assessor to taxpayer, Inland Revenue could confine it self to a <b>selective</b> <b>audit</b> of cases which would be much more productive in respect of revenue and manpower. " (Margo Report, 1986 :para 28. 37) A self-assessment system is in short a system where the taxpayer computes his/her tax liability, completes the relevant forms and sends the payment together with the forms to the Revenue Authorities. The Revenue Authorities apply scientifically developed selection methods to select taxpayers to be audited. The Office of the Commissioner will then be able to concentrate his limited resources on revenue producing sectors and those sectors where the possibility of tax evasion are perceived to be the biggest. In this way more tax can thus be collected. The Margo Commissions' report appeared in 1986. With the obvious advantages of a self assessment system one tends to wonder why this system has not been implemented yet. Reasons why South Africa docs not have a self-assessment system The Department of Inland Revenue gives the following two reasons for the delay: The material number of discretions contained in the Income Tax Act; and The current computer system will have to be upgraded to handle a self-assessment system. A system that will be able to handle self-assessment will cost approximately R 16 million. It is true that discretions are a problem in a self-assessment environment, because of the uncertainty they create when the taxpayer do not know how the Commissioner will apply the discretion. This problem need not be overwhelming, as all the other countries under self assessment have discretions in their income tax acts. Discretions can never be removed completely. Other have to be found to create certainty, for example practice notes and binding directives. Several discretions have already been removed from the Income Tax Actwith the 1991 / 1992 and 1992 / 1993 budgets. By managing the remaining discretions effectively, self-assessment can be a very real possibility. There are several other problems in the way of implementing a self-assessment system, which might prove more difficult to overcome than discretions. Some of these are: • The high illiteracy rate; • A material percentage of the populations are living below the bread line and every available cent is spent on reconstruction and development; • It is only human to expect that there will be a resistance against change • The high cost of compliance. Research in Australia has shown that the cost of compliance for the taxpayer did not decrease and it might even have. increased (pope and Fayle, 1991 : 44...|$|E
40|$|Event {{auditing}} {{today is}} a resource consuming process. Rapidly increasing performance of hardware results in event production at a faster rate. Complex software, multiprogramming and extensive connectivity between software components makes it both difficult and resource demanding to discriminate between malicious and benign system events. Thus, an exhaustive auditing approach is not feasible and there is need for a more efficient solution. We propose a method called <b>selective</b> <b>auditing,</b> where only a specific subset of system events are recorded. This will significantly reduce the required amount of auditing and will produce smaller audit logs of higher quality. We illustrate {{the benefits of the}} <b>selective</b> <b>auditing</b> method by executing four buffer overflow attacks and show that the logs generated by <b>selective</b> <b>auditing</b> are significantly reduced in size while still giving the same detection rate...|$|R
40|$|Tax evasion is universal. It {{depends on}} the {{economic}} and tax structures, types of income, and social attitudes. The theory of tax evasion has limitations since it depends solely on the attitude toward risk with full information regarding the tax administration’s behavior. Methodologies for estimating tax evasion include predominantly estimating the underground economy, and comparing taxes declared with potential tax revenue calculated from national accounts. Actions in addressing tax evasion include use of withholding, presumptive and minimum taxes, <b>selective</b> <b>auditing,</b> penalties, and cross checks between taxes. ...|$|R
50|$|Recommendations (1) HRSA was {{instructed}} to conduct <b>selective</b> <b>audits</b> of 340B covered entities to deter potential diversion. HRSA began conducting such audits in 2012. In FY2012, HRSA completed 51 audits of 340B covered entities, the reports of which {{are available on the}} HRSA website.(2) HRSA {{was instructed}} to finalize new, more specific guidance on the definition of a 340B patient. HRSA reportedly is studying the matter.(3) HRSA should be instructed to further specify its 340B nondiscrimination guidance for cases in which distribution of drugs is restricted and to require reviews of manufacturers' plans to restrict distribution of drugs at 340B prices. HRSA has issued guidance on these issues. (4) HRSA should be instructed to further specify the criteria that hospitals that are not publicly owned or operated must meet to be eligible for the 340B program. Since then HRSA has issued guidance on this issue (Release No. 2013-3).|$|R
40|$|Do {{individuals}} who join the political opposition pay an economic price? We study this question using unique information on individual political activity from Hugo Chávez’s Venezuela, the Maisanta database. The names {{of millions of}} pro-opposition supporters who signed recall petitions (seeking to remove Chávez from office) during 2002 - 2003, {{and the names of}} progovernment supporters who signed counter-petitions, were made public. Media accounts detail how this information has been utilized by both sides: by the Government to punish opposition supporters and firms, and by the overwhelmingly pro-opposition private sector to discriminate against government supporters in hiring. After linking this political database to both national household survey and manufacturing firm data, we find that pro-opposition individuals experience significant drops in total earnings after 2003. There is extensive churning in the labor market: pro-opposition individuals disproportionately leave public sector employment and progovernment individuals leave private sector employment. Pro-opposition firms have falling total employment, less access to foreign exchange, and rising tax burdens (possibly due to <b>selective</b> <b>audits).</b> The misallocation of resources associated with political polarization between 1999 - 2004 contributed to a decline of 5 % in TFP in our sample. To the extent other regimes can identify and punish the political opposition, these findings may help explain why dislodging authoritarian regimes often proves difficult in less developed countries...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop an optimal incentive system for multitasking scientists in universities or professors under repeat contracting. With the aid of a principal agent model under repeat contracting, we show that (i) when a second task is assigned to a professor and the two tasks are related, the size of the optimal incentive rate for the first task is reduced in some situations but not others relative to that of a single task, (ii) with an increase in the noise in the technical relationship of the second task or imprecision in output measurement, the optimal incentive rate for that task is reduced and for the first task may be reduced or increased, (iii) with greater efficiency of the professor in producing the second output, as reflected in ability relative to cost of effort, the optimal incentive rate for the first task generally decreases, (iv) if the output of the professor 2 ̆ 7 s two tasks are negatively correlated then the optimal incentive rate on the first task declines as the size of this correlation increases. The size of the guarantee is always reduced as the professor 2 ̆ 7 s ability for a task increases, but is increased as his cost of effort, noisiness of the technology or measurement of output, or correlation between the two outputs increases. It is also possible that, as a professor undertakes several difficult-to-measure tasks, the incentive rate will be reduced to the point that an optimal compensation system will involve only a guaranteed salary, which is a very weak incentive for effort. <b>Selective</b> <b>audits</b> may be useful in these situations...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Quality {{assurance}} techniques applied {{within the}} healthcare industry {{have been widely}} used and are intended to improve patient outcomes. Two methods that have been utilized are incident reporting and medical chart review (MCR). The objectives for this study were to evaluate facilitated incident monitoring (FIM) and MCR in the intensive care setting. DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparison of prospective FIM and retrospective MCR. SETTING: Tertiary, 12 -bed, closed intensive care unit (ICU) in Australia providing adult and pediatric intensive care to surgical, medical, trauma, and retrieval patients. PATIENTS: Patients present or admitted to the ICU during the 2 -month study period. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: During the study period, there were 176 admissions involving 164 patients. A total of 100 FIM reports, of which 70 related to care provided by the ICU team, identified 221 incidents. There were 30 FIM reports that described adverse events, of which only one related to ICU team care. Potential of harm was estimated to be minimal in 49 % and significant in 51 %; 84 % of incidents were considered preventable. Important contextual information was provided, including evidence for the importance of system factors. MCR identified 132 adverse events involving 48 % of charts, and 47 related to ICU team care. Common adverse events included nosocomial infections, aspiration, neurologic compromise, respiratory arrest, delayed diagnosis, and treatment. Twenty percent of adverse events were considered preventable, and in 41 %, there was evidence of system causation. CONCLUSION: FIM provided more contextual information about incidents and identified a larger number and higher proportion of preventable problems than MCR, but FIM identified few iatrogenic infections, problems with pain management, or problems leading to ICU admission. FIM is easily incorporated into the clinical routine. This study suggests that incident monitoring may be more useful for identifying quality problems, and it could be supplemented by <b>selective</b> <b>audits</b> and focused MCR to detect problems not reported well by FIM.
