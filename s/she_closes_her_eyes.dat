5|$|The video {{starts with}} Farmer slowly walking in an {{laboratory}} {{in which many}} animals are captive to serve as experiments. Depicting a supernatural creature, the singer approaches every cage {{to look at all}} the animals — pigeons, cats, bobcats, rabbits, mouses, a snake, an owl, a monkey, a doe — and heals them with her magic hands. Then she takes a wounded little cat out of its cage and puts it on her shoulders. During the second refrain, she remains standing with closed eyes {{in the middle of the}} room and uses her supernatural powers to explode all of the glass cages. She thus releases the animals and, with a monkey in her arms, leads them outside into the woods. Standing in the forest, <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> again and sends many rays of light from her hands. The last scene shows the Earth being covered by that light.|$|E
5|$|The video starts {{showing a}} woman {{galloping}} through a snowy forest on horseback. She enters a warehouse where a cage surrounded by crows is suspended by chains. Nearby {{there is a}} trapped short-haired woman with a flayed face and crow-like eyes. The first woman stops under the cage {{and looks up at}} it. She casts a stone against a wall that reflects her like a mirror and the building collapses. In the snow, she finds a body—the second woman, inanimate and frozen—hidden under a blanket. <b>She</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> plunges her hands into the body and pulls out a sword. Entering the forest, she sees numerous flying crows and ends up on a snowy plain on which there are erected many scarecrows. During the refrains, she uses her sword to destroy scarecrows, rip their sails and break the wooden crosses. Scarecrows' eyes weep black blood that turns to crows. Then, it is shown how the other woman was killed: the big peaks which covered the ceiling of her cage had gradually collapsed on her. Finally, the living woman plants her sword in the snow, then disappears into the air. Farmer plays the role of both women.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a long shot {{of a group of}} dancers who have just {{finished}} rehearsing a dance routine. As the dancers walk out of view, Rihanna walks onto the middle of the floor, where the singer turns, and faces the camera, and closes her eyes. Standing still, Rihanna begins to click her fingers, whereby the screen begins to cut between a scene of Rihanna, who is noticeably in a different setting, and black fades. As the song's audio begins to play, it becomes apparent that the setting has changed from a rehearsal studio into a nightclub, which Rihanna in the centre. The scene is fairly dark with different colour lights projected into different areas of the nightclub, as dancers infiltrate the dance floor surrounding Rihanna. This scene is used for the first verse-chorus-verse part of the song, but changes to a scene of Rihanna, accompanied by several dancers, situated in a gym locker room for the second chorus. For the bridge, the scene changes back to Rihanna in the nightclub, but this time in a different change of attire. This scene is used for the final chorus. The video ends with a close-up of Rihanna in the nightclub standing still as the audio finishes, where <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> which prompts the scene to change back to Rihanna {{in the middle of the}} rehearsal studio from the beginning of the video, to which she walks out of view of the camera.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> in token {{that the}} brief {{audience}} was over.|$|R
60|$|It {{was of no}} use lecturing <b>her</b> again, for <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> again, {{and went}} on talking incoherently to herself.|$|R
25|$|After an {{argument}} between Mercy and Fatboy, she pushes {{him and he}} falls onto a tree planted in memory of Trina Johnson (Sharon Duncan Brewster), breaking it. Worried that Trina's ex-husband Lucas Johnson (Don Gilet) will be angry with them, they enlist Leon and Zsa Zsa's help to replace the tree. However, as they dig up the tree, they discover the body of Owen Turner (Lee Ross) buried beneath it. The next day, Fatboy comforts Mercy when she says it is all she can see when <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> She attends Lucas's Bible class and questions him about false prophets and a passage that states that anyone who questions a priest should be put to death, causing Lucas to make an excuse to leave because he cannot answer her. Grace asks Mercy {{to write a letter}} of apology to Lucas, but Mercy throws it away. Mercy and Fatboy play rounders but smash Dot Branning's (June Brown) window, which Fatboy repairs. Mercy asks Dot if she can attend her church. When Zsa Zsa is left homeless, she asks to move in with Mercy and her grandmother.|$|E
2500|$|When Dorothy leaves Oz {{after having}} several adventures there and befriending many of Oz's natives, she is magically carried over the Deadly Desert {{by means of}} the charmed Silver Shoes she had been given shortly after her {{unexpected}} arrival when her farmhouse landed on and killed the previous pair's owner, the Wicked Witch of the East. After knocking her heels together three times and wishing to return home, Dorothy is lifted into the air and transported to Kansas. The shoes however, slip off of Dorothy's feet and are lost forever in the desert. Baum states the silver shoes are never recovered. In the 1939 film the shoes are changed to Ruby Slippers. When Dorothy clicks her heels together <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and says: [...] "Theres no place like home". She then wakes up in her bedroom in Kansas believing her experience in Oz to be an elaborate dream.|$|E
2500|$|Tyler {{released}} {{one more}} album with Columbia Records in 1988. It was released {{under the name}} Hide Your Heart in Europe, and Notes From America in the United States. Prolific songwriters for the album included Michael Bolton, Albert Hammond and Desmond Child, who also produced the album. The album enjoyed some success in continental Europe, but only peaked at No. 78 in the UK and failed to chart in the United States. The singles from Hide Your Heart were minor hits for Tyler, but went on to be major hits for other artists, including Kiss (with [...] "Hide Your Heart"), Robin Beck, Cher and Freda Payne (with [...] "Save Up All Your Tears") and Tina Turner with [...] "The Best". When looking back over this era, Desmond Child said:Bonnie Tyler {{is one of the}} greatest singers on Earth. Why? Because she comes to the studio prepared. I've never even seen her use a lyric sheet to sing. She comes with the song memorized, so when she stands there and sings, <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> She's in a sacred space and you feel that. You can say a lot of things about Bonnie Tyler, but you cannot say she does not feel her music.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{ignoring}} his remark. They turned presently into a narrower thoroughfare. She leaned towards him.|$|R
60|$|And {{throwing}} <b>her</b> neck back, <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> again. The sunlight streamed {{in on her}} {{between the}} half-drawn curtains.|$|R
60|$|A sudden {{illuminating}} {{flash of}} horror told <b>her</b> the truth. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{and tried to}} run from the room.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> so {{that she}} may see the revelations more clearly. So does Ginevra.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> faintly--she hears {{nothing but}} those words--feels nothing but his arm round her--forgets Mrs. Crayford's warning--forgets Richard Wardour himself--turns suddenly, with a loving woman's desperate {{disregard}} of everything but her love--nestles {{her head on}} his bosom, and answers him in that way, at last! ...|$|E
6000|$|MURRAY (concealing his doubt). Yes, {{of course}} you are. Only I'd a darn sight rather see you up and about. We could take a walk, then--through the woods. (A wince of pain shadows Eileen's face. <b>She</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> Murray {{continues}} softly, after a pause.) You haven't forgotten that last night--out there--Eileen? ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> as {{with the}} shudder of hearing such words. [...] "Not, surely, by any monstrous chance! Fancy dear, proud Theign------!" ...|$|R
60|$|Involuntarily <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> as Billy's thumb-ends {{pressed into}} them. She {{could feel the}} fore-running ache of a dull and terrible hurt.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> tightly. Gavin {{was in a}} quandary. I {{suppose he}} had looked at <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> too long to know much about them.|$|R
60|$|There ensued a {{struggle}} that Honora will never forget. And although she never again saw that farm-house, its details and surroundings {{come back to}} her in vivid colours when <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> The great horse in every conceivable pose, with veins standing out and knotty muscles twisting in his legs and neck and thighs. Once, when he dashed into the apple trees, she gave a cry; a branch snapped, and Chiltern emerged, still seated, with his hat gone and the blood trickling from a scratch on his forehead. She saw him strike with his spurs, and in a twinkling horse and rider had passed over the dilapidated remains of a fence and were flying down the hard clay road, disappearing into a dip. A reverberating sound, like a single stroke, {{told them that the}} bridge at the bottom had been crossed.|$|E
50|$|Athena {{smiles at}} him then starts to feel sleepy. When <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> she ends up dying in his arms.|$|E
50|$|Peter finally {{starts to}} walk, and Shari goes {{to visit her}} actual mother; when she gets tucked in, <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes...</b> forever.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, stay, my {{only true}} love, stay," [...] The {{constant}} Marg'ret cry'd; Wan grew <b>her</b> cheeks, <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> [...] Stretched <b>her</b> soft limbs, and dy'd.|$|R
60|$|A little tremor {{seemed to}} pass through her whole frame. For a moment <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> Then <b>she</b> sprang {{to her feet and}} stood quivering before him.|$|R
60|$|The {{twilight}} {{was falling}} slate-blue at the window. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>closed</b> away the monotonous level of dead wonder, and opened them {{again to the}} every-day world.|$|R
50|$|Whenever <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> all Sanjana sees are {{a variety}} of ghosts staring at her in various states of blood and gore. When she awakens she can see them lying by her side.|$|E
5000|$|... "I Wanna Make You Close Your Eyes" [...] is {{a country}} ballad, in which the song's male narrator tells his lover {{that he wants to}} make her close her eyes, in other words, feel sexual arousal to the point that <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to savor it.|$|E
50|$|A daydreamer, Georgie Allerton's {{imagination}} goes to {{work while}} she {{falls in love with}} her sister Miriam's husband-to-be, Jim Lucas. <b>She</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and has a fantasy of what life with Ji would be like, ignoring the genuine attentions of Clark Redfield, an honest but poor newspaper reporter.|$|E
60|$|Dora said no more, but {{sank down}} on the couch. Then an idea came to her mind, and lying back <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and pretended to go to sleep.|$|R
60|$|Having {{launched}} this dart, <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{again with}} something more like content {{than she had}} yet shown: it had an aim of which she could always be sure.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{and waited}} for the end. No slender shafts pierced her tender side. She raised her lids to see what stayed the hand of her executioners.|$|R
50|$|Five hours later, Twilight's {{army has}} the Slayers at gun point. Buffy wakes up {{where she was}} dropped, {{partially}} covered in snow, and sees the survivors of her defeated army being ushered into some transport vehicles. <b>She</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> to clear her mind, and when she opens them again she finds herself floating a long way above the ground. Somehow, Buffy has acquired the ability to fly.|$|E
50|$|As {{the woman}} reaches {{the bottom of}} the stairs, she looks {{straight}} into the lens. The expression on her face changes to the one of wide-eyed horror that was displayed on the faces of the man and woman outside. <b>She</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and collapses. E checks on where the man had been, but O has made his escape. His coat tails are seen flying up the stairs.|$|E
50|$|The story ends ambiguously. A {{series of}} scenes showing Ben and Mya with Clark, {{stocking}} up on supplies, then Ben and Mya going separate ways from Clark, suggesting they have succeeded. However, the next scene reveals Mya still {{tied to the}} chair, seemingly catatonic due to her prolonged exposure to the Signal. Ben places Mya's headphones on her, and <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> a tear rolling down her cheek, before the credits appear. Whether this is the final reality, or a flashback before Ben and Mya's escape from the city, is left for the viewer to decide.|$|E
60|$|So she {{sat down}} {{in a corner of the}} coop, leaned her back against the slats, nodded at the {{friendly}} stars before <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> and was asleep in half a minute.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, no. It {{seems to}} me {{as though it were}} no time since we were being hustled into those boats. I can see it all now." [...] <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> with a shudder.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{for several}} moments. For some reason or other, this last {{reflection}} seemed {{to bring her}} no particular relief. When she opened them again, her decision was written in her face.|$|R
