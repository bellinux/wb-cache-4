For the PlayStation 2 mode, this is {{available}} upon completion of any career level, while for the Xbox 360 version, the mode is unlocked after completing the career mode at Easy level or higher.

5|$|The game's <b>score</b> <b>system</b> {{is based}} on a {{multiplier}} bar and a hit gauge counter. As the player destroys enemy cores, the hit counter increases. Points awarded for destroyed cores are multiplied by the value of the hit counter. The counter decreases when the player stops destroying cores. However, if the multiplier reaches a certain amount it will begin to flash, awarding large point bonuses for any cores destroyed during this short period of time.|$|E
5|$|Early on, {{the player}} {{is given the}} choice between three {{different}} game modes, each with unique cutscenes, puzzles to solve and locations to visit: the Team Path, the Wits Path, and the Fists Path. In the Team Path, protagonist Indiana Jones is joined by his partner Sophia Hapgood who will provide support throughout the game. The Wits Path features an abundance of complex puzzles, while the Fists Path focuses heavily on action sequences and fist fighting, the latter of which is completely optional {{in the other two}} modes. Atypical for LucasArts titles, it is possible for the player character to die at certain points in the game, though dangerous situations were designed to be easily recognizable. A <b>score</b> <b>system,</b> the Indy Quotient Points, keeps track of the puzzles solved, the obstacles overcome and the important objects found.|$|E
30|$|Seven cystic {{fibrosis}} <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> for chest radiography with 25 or more citations {{were found in}} the Web of Science database, but the Shwachman-Kulczycki <b>scoring</b> <b>system</b> from 1958 [10], the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical score from 1973 [12] and the Royal Children´s Hospital (RCH) pulmonary score from 1981 [14] were excluded since the scores are a part of clinical scores not included in this review and other authors have shown that the Brasfield score [11] is superior to those <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> [36, 37]. Thus four radiography <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> remained for analysis: the Chrispin-Norman <b>scoring</b> <b>system</b> from 1974 [13] (with modifications 1982 [15] and 2005 [21]), the Brasfield <b>scoring</b> <b>system</b> from 1979 [11], the Wisconsin <b>scoring</b> <b>system</b> from 1993 [18] (with validation in 2000 [20]) and the Northern <b>scoring</b> <b>system</b> from 1994 [19].|$|R
30|$|Nine chest CT cystic {{fibrosis}} <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> with 25 or more citations {{were found in}} the Web of Science database, but the Brody I <b>scoring</b> <b>system</b> [29] was excluded from the comparison due {{to the development of the}} Brody II <b>scoring</b> <b>system</b> [34]. Thus, eight CT <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> remained for analysis: Bhalla [22] and Nathanson [23] from 1991, Maffessanti from 1996 [25], Shah from 1997 [27], Santamaria from 1998 [28], Helbich from 1999 [30, 38], Robinson from 2001 [32], and Brody II from 2004 [34] (Table  3).

SUMOplot has been used in the past to predict Ubc9 dependent sites.|$|E
25|$|The game {{supports}} control {{schemes for}} left and right-handed players, switching the character movement controls between the D-pad and C-buttons on the Nintendo 64 controller. The analog stick {{is used to}} control the reticle. The game features a <b>score</b> <b>system</b> which grants bonuses the more hits the player can make without losing all their health. If the player loses all their health or the stage timer expires, it is game over. Items can be picked up to refill the player's health gauge, increase the time, and provide bonus points. The game also features two difficulty modes, easy and normal. Normal mode features extra bosses and enemies {{in addition to being}} generally more difficult.|$|E

30|$|In the {{majority}} of the CT <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> the highest weighting in percentage of the total score is given bronchiectasis, except in the Robinson [32] and Santamaria [28] <b>scoring</b> <b>systems.</b> In the Robinson <b>scoring</b> <b>system</b> [32], all <b>scoring</b> components are given the same weighting (20 %), and in the Santamaria system [28] parenchymal changes are given the highest weighting (43 %). Bronchiectasis together with mucus plugging is given the highest weighting in all <b>scoring</b> <b>systems,</b> except in the Santamaria system, and the parenchymal abnormalities are given a relatively high weighting in many <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> (Table  7, Fig.  2).

Since businesses operate globally, social networks can make it easier {{to keep in touch with}} contacts around the world. Applications for social networking sites have extended toward businesses and brands are creating their own, high functioning sites, a sector known as brand networking. It is the idea that a brand can build its consumer relationship by connecting their consumers to the brand image on a platform that provides them relative content, elements of participation, and a ranking or <b>score</b> <b>system.</b> Brand networking is a new way to capitalize on social trends as a marketing tool.

40|$|We have {{validated}} two <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> {{for predicting}} postoperative nausea and vomiting, derived by Apfel et al. and Koivuranta et al. from 1388 adult inpatients undergoing {{a wide range}} of surgical procedures. The predictive accuracy of the <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> was evaluated in terms of the ability to discriminate between patients with and without postoperative nausea and vomiting (discrimination) and agreement between observed and predicted outcomes (calibration). Discrimination and calibration were less than expected based on previous reports, with both <b>scoring</b> <b>systems</b> providing risk predictions that were too extreme. The area under the ROC curve was 0. 63 for Apfel et al. 's <b>scoring</b> <b>system</b> and 0. 66 for Koivuranta et al.

40|$|In 1999, the International Volleyball Federation (IVF) {{changed the}} <b>scoring</b> <b>system</b> of volleyball, from the side-out <b>scoring</b> <b>system</b> to the rally <b>scoring</b> <b>system.</b> The main {{goal of the}} <b>scoring</b> <b>system</b> change {{was to make the}} length of the game more predictable.

Then, I analyze data on volleyball matches from the U. S. Women's Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference, and compare the variance of the length of the matches before and after the <b>scoring</b> <b>system</b> change in 2000 and 2001.
