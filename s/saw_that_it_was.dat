5|$|Using {{an alcohol}} lamp, Wöhler heated {{alternating}} layers of beryllium chloride and potassium in a wired-shut platinum crucible. The above reaction immediately took place and caused the crucible to become white hot. Upon cooling and washing the resulting gray-black powder he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> made of fine particles {{with a dark}} metallic luster. The highly reactive potassium had been produced by the electrolysis of its compounds, a process discovered 21 years before. The chemical method using potassium yielded only small grains of beryllium from which no ingot of metal could be cast or hammered.|$|E
5|$|These acts of {{violence}} were influenced by a desire for revenge and retribution for crimes committed by the Nazis during their invasion of the Soviet Union, collectively driven by Soviet propaganda. The propaganda was a purposeful goad to the Soviet soldier and reflected {{the will of the}} political authorities in the Soviet Union right up to Stalin. There is no question that Stalin was aware of what was happening. Given the strict control of the Communist party over the military hierarchy, the pillage and rape in Prussia {{was the result of the}} Soviet command at all levels. Only when Stalin <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in the Soviet Union's interests to check the behaviour of the Red Army did he take steps to stop it.|$|E
5|$|Initially other {{villages in}} the area, chiefly Mattau, Soulang and Bakloan, also professed their desire {{to live in peace}} with the Dutch. The villages <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> in their {{interest}} to maintain good relations with the newcomers, but this belief was weakened by a series of incidents between 1625 and 1629. The earliest of these was a Dutch attack on Chinese pirates in the bay of Wancan, not far from Mattau, in 1625. The pirates were able to drive off the Dutch soldiers, causing the Dutch to lose face among the Formosan villages. Encouraged by this Dutch failure, warriors from Mattau raided Sinkan, believing the Dutch too weak to defend their Formosan friends. At this point, the Dutch returned to Wancan and this time were able to rout the pirates, restoring their reputation. Mattau was then forced by the colonials to return the property stolen from Sinkan and make reparations in the form of two pigs. The peace was short-lived, however, because in November 1626 the villagers of Sinkan attacked Mattau and Bakloan, before going to the Dutch to ask for protection from retribution. Although the Dutch were able to force Sinkan's enemies to back down in this case, in later incidents they proved incapable of fully protecting their Formosan allies.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{execution}} of Agis, Cleomenes—-who was around eighteen at the time—-was forced by his father to marry Agis' widow, Agiatis, who was a wealthy heiress. According to legend, Cleomenes was hunting when his father sent him a message telling him to return immediately to Sparta. When {{he returned to the}} city, he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> being decorated for a wedding and when he asked his father who was getting married, his father replied that he, Cleomenes, was. It was reported that Cleomenes was doubtful about the marriage because his father had had Agiatis' husband executed. Nevertheless, the marriage went ahead.|$|E

All those who had fallen had been tied with a Manila rope, or with a second and equally strong one, and consequently it had been only between the survivors and those who had fallen where the weaker rope had been used. Whymper also had suggested to Hudson that they should have attached a rope to the rocks on the most difficult place, and held it as they descended, as an additional protection. Hudson approved the idea, but it was never done.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} Prussian victory at Königgrätz, Bismarck asked the Parliament {{for more money}} for the army, which raised a new {{controversy}} between the liberal parliamentarians. Frederick welcomed {{the creation of the}} North German Confederation, which joined Prussia and some Germanic principalities, because he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the first step toward German unification. However, the Confederation was far from adopting the liberal ideas of the Crown Prince. Despite being democratically elected, the Reichstag didn't have the same powers as a Parliament. In addition, local sovereigns were more interested in maintaining their prerogatives, and the new German constitution gave many powers to the now Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. Less enthusiastic than her husband, Vicky saw the North German Confederation {{as an extension of the}} Prussian political system she hated. Nevertheless, she remained hopeful that this situation was temporary and that a united and liberal Germany could be created.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, Stoltenberg {{went into}} more detail {{about how she}} {{started out as a}} drug addict, to TV {{journalist}} Tonje Steinsland–the second time her life as an addict {{was the subject of a}} television special. It started in 1991, when she was 27. She witnessed two drug addicts in a fight in a cafe in Oslo when something fell out of the pocket of one of them. She picked it up and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> heroin. Together with her boyfriend she went home and decided to snort the drug. For the next three years she was an intravenous drug user. By the end of the 1990s, she was close to dying. In the interview, Stoltenberg also tells of a boyfriend who subjected her to punishments, psychological terror and much fear, however, the heroin turned all of that into a feeling of freedom and made her perceive their relationship as simply wonderful, for a while.|$|E
25|$|One such {{story is}} that of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi. The rabbi, a friend of Elijah’s, was asked what favor he might wish. The rabbi {{answered}} only that {{he be able to}} join Elijah in his wanderings. Elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking any questions about any of the prophet’s actions. He agreed and they began their journey. The first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow. The old couple gave of their hospitality as best they could. The next morning, as the travelers left, Elijah prayed that the old cow would die and it did. The second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man. He had no patience for his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that they should get jobs and not beg from honest people. As they were leaving, they passed the man’s wall and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> crumbling. Elijah prayed that the wall be repaired and it was so. Next, they came to a wealthy synagogue. They were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions. When they left, Elijah prayed that every member of the synagogue might become a leader.|$|E
