The police arrived at 5:30 pm, accompanied by the deputy coroner. At {{the time of her}} death she was under surveillance by the FBI, and her phone had been tapped, <b>so</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the first people informed about it was FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, via a teletype link. The news of her death was reported in Bay Area newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Like {{others of}} the Ealing comedies, Whisky Galore! explores {{the actions of a}} small insular group facing and {{overcoming}} a more powerful opponent. It was filmed on the island of Barra; the weather was so poor that the production over-ran its 10-week schedule by five weeks, and the film went £20,000 over budget. The initial cut of the film was considered poor by Michael Balcon, the head of the studio, <b>so</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Ealing's directors, Charles Crichton, added additional footage and re-edited the film prior to its release.|$|E
5|$|Conventional fission {{power plants}} {{rely on the}} chain {{reaction}} caused when fission events release thermal neutrons that cause further fission events. Each fission event in U-235 releases two or three neutrons with about 2MeV of kinetic energy. By careful arrangement {{and the use of}} various absorber materials, designers can balance the system <b>so</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> those neutrons causes another fission event while the other one or two are lost. This balance is known as criticality. Natural uranium is a mix of three isotopes; mainly U-238, with some U-235, and trace amounts of U-234. The neutrons released in the fission of either of the main isotopes will cause fission in U-235, but not in U-238, which requires higher energies around 5MeV. There is not enough U-235 in natural uranium to reach criticality. Commercial light water nuclear reactors, the most prevalent power reactors in the world, use nuclear fuel containing uranium enriched to 3 to 5% U-235 while the leftover is U-238.|$|E

25|$|The {{estimated}} {{market for}} regional procurement is approximately US$17 billion annually among {{the region of}} {{five and a half}} million people (with the exception of Haiti).

25|$|This deep {{alignment}} station required heavy pylons {{to support}} the vaults. In 1930s, architects were obsessed with relieving passengers' anxiety of being underground, <b>so</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the objectives was to make these pylons look slimmer. Dushkin proposed an interesting solution - decorate the pylons with wider arches, filling {{the gap between the}} fake and real arch with sculpture. This, he presumed, would narrow the perceived width of pylons.|$|E

25|$|The {{conception}} of symmetry is {{explained in the}} following way: One imagines a man sitting in the paryanka posture, i.e. crossing the legs and placing the hands over the navel. If one imagines that the two knees are joined by a line, and from the right shoulder to the left knee, and from the left shoulder to the right knee, and from the forehead to the hands, a straight line is drawn, one gets four lines. If these are equal to one another, symmetry is apparent; {{if they are not}} <b>so,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the other 5 samsthanas results. Gods have only the first symmetry, infernal beings and jivas who have been produced through coagulation only the 6th figure; in the case of animals and men (also of kevalins) all six samsthanas are to be found.|$|E

Brătianu and Mihail Kogălniceanu, {{founded the}} semi-legal Însocierea Lazariană ("Lazarian Association"). Named {{in honor of}} Gheorghe Lazăr, it had a political project to unify and standardize education in both Principalities. This agenda was seen as untimely by other intellectuals, including Alexandru G. Golescu, who refused to participate. Now openly drawn to radical politics, Vârnav became {{an active participant in}} the February Revolution, serving in the National Guard. He reportedly tried to cross the border into Moldavia that March, just days before of the abortive liberal revolution; the conservative Prince Mihail Sturdza ordered the border guards to prevent him from doing <b>so.</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> his companions, Teodor Râșcanu, managed to pass through, but soon after had to flee for Wallachia.|$|E

25|$|By 1901, the Australian colonies were federated and {{formally}} {{joined together}} {{to become the}} Commonwealth of Australia, {{and the federal government}} assumed all defensive responsibilities. The Federation of Australia came into existence on 1 January 1901 and as of that time the constitution of Australia stated that all defence responsibility was vested in the Commonwealth government. Co-ordination of Australia-wide defensive efforts in the face of imperial German interest in the Pacific Ocean {{was one of the main}} reasons for federation, and <b>so</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the first decisions made by the newly formed Commonwealth government was to create the Department of Defence which came into being on 1 March 1901. From that time the Australian Army came into being under the command of Major General Sir Edward Hutton, and all of the colonial forces, including those then on active service in South Africa, transferred into the Australian Army.|$|E

Although some performers who, at the time, were not professional later became <b>so,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the professional actors, Vladimír Pucholt, who played a major role, Milda the pianist, soon gave up acting, relocated to Canada and became a dentist.|$|E

500|$|Since {{at least}} the thirteenth century, the {{mountain}} has been {{regarded as one of}} the Seven Wonders of Dauphiné. The mountain is most noted for its first ascent in 1492. Charles VIII ordered that the peak be climbed, <b>so</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his servants, Antoine de Ville, made the ascent using a combination of ladders, ropes and other artificial aids. He was visited in the following days by many local members of the nobility and aristocracy. The team bivouacked on the summit for eight days, erecting small crosses and a stone shelter. [...] The ascent is described by François Rabelais in his Quart Livre. This was the first recorded climb of any technical difficulty, and has been said to mark the beginning of mountaineering.|$|E
500|$|The rescuers, {{after an}} {{unsuccessful}} attempt to force open the van with hatchets, sledgehammers, and crowbars, called upon Police Sergeant Brett, who {{was inside the}} van with the prisoners, to open the door. Brett refused, <b>so</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the rescuers placed his revolver at the keyhole of the van to blow the lock, just as Brett looked through the keyhole {{to see what was}} happening outside. The bullet passed through his eye into his brain and killed him. The door was opened when one of the women prisoners took the keys from Brett's pocket, and passed them through a ventilator to the Fenians outside, allowing Kelly and Deasy to escape. Brett was the first Manchester police officer to be killed on duty, in an incident that became known locally as the [...] "Manchester Outrages".|$|E

500|$|When Shackleton was {{selecting}} the crew for his Antarctic expedition in Nimrod, Joyce {{was one of}} his earliest recruits. Most accounts tell the story that Shackleton saw Joyce on a bus that was passing his expedition offices, sent someone out to fetch him, and recruited him on the spot. To join the expedition, Joyce bought his release from the Navy; in later years he would claim that Shackleton had failed to recompense him for this, despite a promise to do <b>so,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> several disputes over money and recognition which would strain [...] his relations with Shackleton. [...] Joyce, Shackleton and Frank Wild were the only members of the expedition with previous Antarctic experience, and {{on the basis of his}} Discovery exploits, Joyce was put in charge of the [...] new expedition's general stores, sledges and dogs. Before departure in August 1907, he and Wild took a crash course in printing at Sir Joseph Causton's printing firm in Hampshire, as Shackleton intended to publish a book or magazine while in the Antarctic.|$|E

We've been used to making a certain type of music and using sounds to accomplish that. So to break out of that and push ourselves to grow is definitely challenging." [...] Shinoda later said the album was not a concept record, saying, [...] "People asked us if it's a concept record, and in the middle of the process, we were contemplating whether or not that was what we wanted to do," [...] although he said that eventually, A Thousand Suns at its completion has no narrative and is [...] "more abstract" [...] than many concept albums.|$|E
