On the road, he stayed in his hotel room, studying video of his at-bats or playing video games. In an era before laptops and tablets, Gwynn bought his own video equipment and lugged it {{from town to town}} along with tapes of his games. His wife traveled with a Betamax video cassette recorder that {{was the size of a}} suitcase to tape his at-bats. Still, the Padres were the last MLB team to hire a video coordinator. Gwynn later invested in close to $100,000 in video equipment that he shared with his teammates. Few hitters were as meticulous as Gwynn with his detailed notebooks and videotape, which he spent hours studying. He studied pitchers, watching them in the bullpen and on television or video, to learn their tendencies on every count. He spent hours watching video and analyzing his <b>swing</b> <b>frame</b> by frame. He had one tape of each team, which included his at-bats against that team in the season.

5000|$|Early {{development}} of hydraulic systems {{for what would}} become the backhoe loader proceeded in parallel in the US and the UK. The invention of the first backhoe <b>swing</b> <b>frame</b> was developed in July 1947 by Vaino J. Holopainen (pronounced [...] "Waino") and Roy E. Handy, Jr. (thus the company name [...] "Wain-Roy"), and assigned to Wain-Roy Corporation of Hubbardston, Massachusetts, United States. In July 1948, patent # 2,698,697 was filed by Vaino J. Holopainen. The <b>swing</b> <b>frame</b> breakthrough allowed the hydraulic digging arm to swing to the side to dump the bucket. This patent also included the invention of the out-rigger bar, and high flow control. In April 1948 Wain-Roy Corporation sold the very first all hydraulic backhoe, mounted to a Ford Model 8N tractor, to the Connecticut Light and Power Company. Wain-Roy made 24 units in 1948. Wain-Roy also made them for Sherman Products of Royal Oak, Michigan, and Ford. Approximately 7000 Wain-Roy Backhoes were manufactured and sold between the fall of 1948 and early 1954, mainly through Ford dealers.|$|E

With a 149 cc four-stroke, side-valve, water-cooled, horizontally opposed twin-cylinder engine, the LE {{also had a}} radiator and was fitted with coil ignition to help starting. The hand change three-speed gearbox, engine and clutch were contained in special castings, and final drive was by a shaft mounted in a <b>swing</b> <b>frame</b> with adjustable suspension. Aluminium leg shields were designed to keep the rain off, and footboards gave it a scooter feel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{new type}} of {{vibration}} structure (i. e. <b>swing</b> <b>frame)</b> of vertical dynamic balancing machine is designed, which is based on the analysis of traditional double-plane vertical dynamic balancing machine’s <b>swing</b> <b>frame.</b> The static unbalance and couple unbalance can be separated effectively by using the new dynamic balancing machine with the new <b>swing</b> <b>frame.</b> The modal and harmonic responses are analyzed by using the ANSYS 7. 0. By comparing the finite element modal analysis with the experimental modal analysis, the natural frequencies and vibration modes are found out, which can provide the dynamics direction for designing vertical dynamic balancing machine. The new dynamic balancing machine can measure static unbalance and couple unbalance directly, and the influence between them is faint. The practical result indicates that the new vertical dynamic balancing machine is suitable for inertial measurement of flying objects, and can overcome the shortcomings of traditional double-plane vertical dynamic balancing machines, in which the effect of plane-separation is inferior. The vertical dynamic balancing machine with the new vibration structure can be widely used in the future application...|$|E

One arm was under his head, the other lay on top of the blankets. Wolf Larsen put thumb and forefinger to the wrist and counted the pulse. In the midst of it the Kanaka roused. He awoke as gently as he slept. There was no movement of the body whatever. The eyes, only, moved. They flashed wide open, big and black, and stared, unblinking, into our faces. Wolf Larsen put his finger to his lips as a sign for silence, and the eyes closed again.|$|R

50|$|Starting in 1857, {{construction}} on Fort Taber (also known as Fort Rodman) begin {{adjacent to the}} lighthouse. The fort became obsolete following the civil war, and construction was finally halted in 1871, though the stone superstructure was essentially complete {{by the end of}} the war. The walls were found to obscure the lighthouse beacon from some quarters, and therefore a new lighthouse was built on the fort itself. This was a small wooden structure with the lantern set on its hipped roof. Special <b>swinging</b> <b>frames</b> were provided for the lantern to minimize the risk of damage when the fort's cannons were fired, but these were never put to the test. The old tower was abandoned and was eventually demolished in 1906. By that time the Butler Flats Light had been established next to the shipping channel, and the light on the fort was rendered obsolete; the Clarks Point keeper was transferred to the new light in 1898, and the old light was extinguished.|$|R
