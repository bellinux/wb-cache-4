We evaluated the surveillance outputs, reporting intervals and detection of World Cup-relevant events for the enhanced system. Outbreak numbers for measles, Norovirus and Campylobacter {{were significantly higher}} than in previous years, but all increases were explained by prior trends. The median interval (disease onset to receipt at national centre) fell from 17 days in 2005 to 12 days in 2006. Detection of World Cup-relevant events was 44 % (8 / 18) in the routine system and 77 % (14 / 18) in <b>supplementary</b> <b>reports.</b> We did not identify any significant effect on infectious disease epidemiology relating to the FIFA 2006 World Cup.

2500|$|A {{schematic}} (non-quantitative) curve {{was used}} to represent temperature variations over the last 1000 years in chapter 7.

The section specifically states recent climate changes were in a range of probably less than 2°C. [...] The 1990 report noted that it was not clear whether all the fluctuations indicated were truly global (p 202).

2500|$|The art {{historian}} Nikolaus Pevsner {{has said that}} exhibits in the Great Exhibition showed [...] "ignorance of that basic need in creating patterns, {{the integrity of the}} surface" [...] and [...] "vulgarity in detail". Design reform began with the organisers of the Exhibition itself, Henry Cole (1808–1882), Owen Jones (1809–1874), Matthew Digby Wyatt (1820–1877) and Richard Redgrave (1804–1888), who deprecated excessive ornament and impractical and badly made things. The organisers were [...] "unanimous in their condemnation of the exhibits." [...] Owen Jones, for example, complained that [...] "the architect, the upholsterer, the paper-stainer, the weaver, the calico-printer, and the potter" [...] produce [...] "in art novelty without beauty, or beauty without intelligence." [...] From these criticisms of the contemporary state of manufactured goods emerged several publications which set out what the writers considered to be the correct principles of design. Richard Redgrave's <b>Supplementary</b> <b>Report</b> on Design (1852) analysed the principles of design and ornament and pleaded for [...] "more logic in the application of decoration." [...] Other works followed in a similar vein: Wyatt's Industrial Arts of the Nineteenth Century (1853), Gottfried Semper's Wissenschaft, Industrie und Kunst ("Science, Industry and Art") (1852), Ralph Wornum's Analysis of Ornament (1856), Redgrave's Manual of Design (1876) and Jones's Grammar of Ornament (1856). The Grammar of Ornament was particularly influential, liberally distributed as a student prize and running into nine reprints by 1910.|$|E

In this sense, {{the aim of this}} study was to verify the consistency and form of {{disclosure of}} the information disclosed by the Corporation Publicly Traded in southern Brazil, from the perspective of reducing the tax burden and the amount allocated to the Culture. The sample consisted of 27 Corporate Capital Open in southern Brazil and analyzed its financial statements, accompanying notes and <b>supplementary</b> <b>reports</b> through pre-established keywords, characterizing the research as descriptive, with a qualitative approach. The results showed the importance of the Notes, the Management Report and additional reports as Social and Sustainability Report. These reports had relevant information and helpful research. However, many of them did not have clear information about the tax incentives for culture. Some companies released the tax incentive culture along with other incentives, such as the Workers Food Program - PAT, which did not allow detailed analysis of the data. We found cases of disagreement between the Ministry of Culture and information disclosed statements. In some cases, were observed lack of information about the tax incentives in the statements and <b>supplementary</b> <b>reports.</b> It was concluded that the disclosure is lower than necessary, because only four out of a total of twenty seven companies analyzed, reported consistent, complete and appropriate on tax incentives for culture...|$|R
