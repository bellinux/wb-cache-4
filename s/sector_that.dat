5|$|From {{the overall}} stock of an {{estimated}} 458 million workers, 394million (86%) operate in the unorganised sector (of which 63% are self-employed) mostly as informal workers. There is a strong relationship between the quality of employment and social and poverty characteristics. The relative growth of informal employment was more rapid within the organised rather than the unorganised sector. This informalisation is also related to the flexibilisation of employment in the organised <b>sector</b> <b>that</b> {{is suggested by the}} increasing use of contract labour by employers in order to benefit from more flexible labour practices.|$|E
5|$|As of 1993, {{there were}} 40 timber-processing plants {{and a number}} of sawmills. Tawau Port is a major export and import gateway for timber {{especially}} from North Kalimantan. A barter trade has been formalised between East Kalimantan (now North Kalimantan) and Sabah with the creation of Tawau Barter Trade Association (BATS) in 1993. The association handles the cash-based trade of raw materials from Indonesia, but in recent years has focussed on timber industry. Other than timber, since British rule ended exports have traditionally been spices, cocoa and tobacco. Birds' nests are harvested at Baturong, Sengarung, Tepadung and Madai Caves by the Ida'an community. Tawau {{is one of the top}} cocoa producers in Malaysia, and the world together with Ivory Coast, Ghana and Indonesia. The town is the cocoa capital for both in Sabah and Malaysia. Cocoa production is mostly concentrated in the interior, north of the town, while palm oil production is concentrated along the roads to Merotai, Brantian, Semporna and Kunak. Both cocoa and palm oil are part of the large agriculture <b>sector</b> <b>that</b> has become the main income producer for the town.|$|E

5|$|At the time, much of {{the rural}} ricelands had been {{abandoned}} due to war and lay fallow. The Americans pressured Diem to assume control of such lands and distribute it to the new settlers and {{to allow them to}} start their new lives and ease the overcrowding in the camps, but no action was taken in 1954. At the time, there was a severe wastage of personnel due to the placement of refugees in land that was inappropriate to them. Vietnamese officials had resolved to place the settlers in land similar to their northern origins so that they could be productive, but bureaucratic difficulties hampered COMIGAL and no plan was produced. Throughout 1954, 60% of the new arrivals identified themselves as having an agrarian background, but only 20% of the total refugees were placed in arable farming areas, meaning that at least 40% of the northerners were in areas not appropriate for their skill set. There were also severe problems in finding and then distributing farming equipment to the northerners so that they could get to work and resuscitate the agricultural <b>sector</b> <b>that</b> was hindered by the war.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day, the 12th Tank Corps and 264th Rifle Division came under heavy {{pressure}} from German tank counterattacks, and on 27 August army commander Prokofy Romanenko, fearing a breakthrough from the south, ordered the 15th Corps to concentrate {{in the forests}} north of Novogryn, in readiness to counterattack if a German breakthrough was made. However, {{by the end of}} the day, the Soviet lines had held and the 15th was not needed in that <b>sector.</b> <b>That</b> night, it was relocated from the Myzin area to the Pakom area, where, together with the 61st Army's 12th Guards Rifle Division, it was to break German resistance near Leonovo, then develop the breakthrough towards Ukolitsa into the rear of the German troops defending against the 154th and 264th Rifle Divisions and the 12th Corps at Bogdanovsky and Goskovo. On the afternoon of 28 August, the corps attacked after a 30-minute artillery bombardment and airstrikes, but was immediately stalled by an anti-tank ditch protected by minefields and artillery. During the night, sappers and motorized infantry managed to create passages through the ditch, but when the offensive was resumed the next morning, the 15th had advanced only 200 to 300 meters before it was stopped by a second anti-tank ditch. During the day it tried to break through, but could not cross the ditch.|$|E
5|$|Presidential {{elections}} in Singapore, {{in which the}} President of Singapore is directly elected by popular vote, were introduced through amendments to the Constitution of Singapore in 1991. Potential candidates for office have to fulfil stringent qualifications {{set out in the}} Constitution. Certificates of eligibility are issued by the Presidential Elections Committee (PEC). In particular, the PEC must assess that they are persons of integrity, good character and reputation; and if they have not previously held certain key government appointments or were the chief executives of profitable companies with shareholders' equity of an average of S$500 million for the most recent three years in that office, they must demonstrate to the PEC that they held a position of comparable seniority and responsibility in the public or private <b>sector</b> <b>that</b> has given them experience and ability in administering and managing financial affairs. The general strictness of the required qualifications led to the walkovers in 3 out of 5 of the presidential elections, as presidents S. R. Nathan and Halimah Yacob were the sole candidates to receive a certificate of eligibility from the PEC in their respective years in the 1999, 2005 and 2017 elections. The stringent criteria, the transparency of the PEC's decision-making process and the practice of political parties endorsing candidates have drawn criticism.|$|E

After the {{financial}} crisis in 2008 there was some <b>sectors</b> <b>that</b> shown a better results than other depending if the sector was affected by the economic situation or not. Therefore can  investments in sector funds {{be a good way}} to get a high return, but it also has a high risk. Problem: Has the risk any impact on the return considered funds in <b>sectors</b> <b>that</b> is affected by the economic situation relatively to <b>sectors</b> <b>that</b> isn’t affected by the situation in the economy? Purpose: Determine whether sector funds risk has any impact on the return. Also if there are any differences between sectors depending if they are affected by the economic situation or not. The study target is private investors who want a deeper understanding for sector funds regarding the different variables you have to consider before an investment. Method: The study is based on a deductive approach and ponders in current theories. Different methods have been used with both primary and secondary data. The qualitative data is based on interviews and the quantitative data is based on statistics. To estimate if there is any connection regarding risk and return a regression analysis has been formed. Conclusion: The study shows that there is a connection between risk and return for <b>sector</b> funds, but <b>that</b> the connection is not significant. Investing in sector funds is not a long term investment, but one should distinguish between <b>sectors</b> <b>that</b> are cyclically sensitive and <b>sectors</b> <b>that</b> are not sensitive cyclically and therefore investing over various economic cycles...|$|R
