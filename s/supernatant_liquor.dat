Methanotrophs-bearing liquid {{cultivated}} {{from the}} aged refuse {{has been proved}} to be effective for improving methane oxidation ability of landfill cover materials, and this is significant for CH 4 emission control in landfill site. Optimization of mixed-cultivation conditions of methanotrophs from the aged refuse was studied in this paper. It was demonstrated that the best inoculums mode was using <b>supernatant</b> <b>liquor</b> of the aged refuse and nitrate minimal salt medium (NMS), and the lag phase of the growth was only 37 hours. The optimum growth of methanotrophs was observed at 28 ~ 35 ℃.

40|$|Background: Although {{aluminum}} species {{constitute a}} predominant proportion of tank wastes, {{the chemistry of}} aluminum in these alkaline solutions is inadequately understood. This is due, in part, to the extreme conditions of the HLW <b>supernatant</b> tank <b>liquors.</b> In REDOX waste, for example, the concentration of Al in HLW supernatants can exceed 1. 5 M. In addition, the pH is often greater than 14, and the individual molar concentrations of Na+, NOi, and NOa- are in excess of 2 M. As {{a consequence of the}} high molar concentrations of A 13 +, Na+, NO;z-, and N 03 -, the activity of water in these supernatant solutions is greatly decreased. The concentration of water in these solutions, is in the range of 35 - 45 M, a significant reduction from the pure bulk water value of 55 M. On the molecular scale, there is not enough water present to satisfy the hydration requirements of the Na+ and AI(O) ions in the alkaline aluminum solutions. Thus, most of the water present in the HLW supernatants is chemically ''tied up'' as hydrated water around the Na+ and Al(OH) d- ions, as well as structural water present in solid aluminate hydrates. The solution-solid phase behavior of the HLW supernatants {{can be thought of as}} a competition for water between ionic hydration and the structural water required for the aluminate hydrates. The role of water in these liquid waste concentrates emerges as a key determinant of which solid phases will form and ultimately control the viscosity and precipitation properties as well as the activities of the radionuclides of interest in HLWs...|$|R
40|$|Three {{identical}} membrane bioreactors (MBRs) were operated over 2 {{years at}} different sludge retention time (SRT) of 10 d, 40 d and no sludge withdrawal (NS), to elucidate and quantify {{the effect of}} SRT on the sludge characteristics and membrane fouling. The hydraulic retention times of these MBRs were controlled at 12 h. With increasing SRT, the sludge concentrations in the MBRs increased, whereas the ratio of volatile suspended solid to the total solid decreased, {{and the size of}} sludge granule diminished in the meantime. A higher sludge concentration at long SRT could maintain a better organic removal efficiency, and a longer SRT was propitious to the growth of nitrifiers. The performance of these MBRs for the removal of COD and NH(4) (+) -N did not change much with different SRTs. However, the bioactivity decreased as SRT increase. The measurement of specific oxygen uptake rates (SOUR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes testified that SOUR and the proportion of the bacteria-specific probe EUB 338 in all DAPI-stainable bacteria decreased with increasing SRT. The concentrations of total organic carbon, protein, polysaccharides and soluble extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) in the mixed <b>liquor</b> <b>supernatant</b> also decreased with increasing SRT. The membrane fouling rate was higher at shorter SRT, and the highest fouling rate appeared at a SRT of 10 d.

40|$|Membrane Bioreactors (MBR), {{integrating}} {{membrane technology}} with biological processing, {{have emerged as}} an innovative technology, ideal for advanced wastewater treatment and water reclamation. The advantages of MBR are partly reduced by membrane fouling, comprising a host of complicated phenomena that result from the interactions between the biological active mixed liquor and the membrane. Τhe goal of this thesis is {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of the close interrelationship between biological processes and membrane filtration, with emphasis on the effect that externally controlled system parameters have on membrane fouling through their influence on specific mixed liquor physicochemical characteristics. The review of the relevant literature reveals the critical role of two specific organic fractions on membrane fouling phenomena; i. e. the soluble organic fraction present in the mixed <b>liquor</b> <b>supernatant</b> (DOM) and the particulate biopolymers that comprise the extracellular matrix of the bacteria bioflocs (EPS). Α mathematical modeling approach of activated sludge bioprocesses, de novo focused on the specific needs of MBR technology is introduced (ASM_MBR), whereas a laboratory scale aerobic, submerged type MBR pilot system that closely simulates the filtration operation of full-scale MBR plants has been designed, constructed and continuously operated for 702 days. A carefully designed protocol of experimental measurements has been implemented to collect reliable data for evaluation of MBR performance, for ASM_MBR calibration and validation, and for assessment of membrane filtration performance in respect of the concentration profiles of DOM and EPS organic fractions. Regarding MBR operating conditions in practice, the experimental data of this study clearly suggest that under moderately high SRT values (e. g. 40 d), the consistently high wastewater treatment efficiency can be accompanied by satisfactory membrane filtration performance. The systematic data analysis has provided ample evidence on the critical and multiple role that DOM and EPS play concerning membrane filtration and has led to identification of mechanisms and phenomena, which significantly affect membrane fouling tendency and deserve further investigation. It is expected that the ASM_MBR mathematical framework can contribute in this direction, constituting a valuable tool for the integration of bioprocesses simulation and membrane filtration modeling. ...|$|R

40|$|A novel ammonia {{stripping}} method, including a CO 2 pre-stripper {{was used to}} treat a mix of <b>supernatant</b> <b>liquor</b> from an anaerobic digester and urine in order to recycle nitrogen as ammonium sulfate at full-scale in the WWTP Kloten/Opfikon. Waste streams were not generated, since the ammonia was recovered as a marketable nitrogen fertilizer, turning a waste product into a valuable product.

The separation step was performed by the use of water free urinals and urine diversion flush toilets. An increase of 10 % in the liquid flux with the addition of the urine translated into a 40 % increase of the ammonia concentration in the inlet of the stripping unit. The achievement of these percentages generated a proportional increase in the fertilizer production. The urine pre-treatment was carried out by adding magnesium to produce a precipitate of struvite. The first experiments with the combined treatment showed the feasibility of the combination of the separation and pre-treatment steps...|$|E

After that, 7.3 g (24 mmol) of sodium oleate and 7 ml of oleic amine were added into the above solution with strongly stirring {{at room temperature for}} 2 h. Then, the reaction precursor was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless autoclave with a capacity of 150 ml. In order to crystallize the particles, the reaction temperature of the autoclave was increased and maintained at 180 °C for 12 h. Then, the system was cooled down to room temperature naturally. The products were separated from the final reaction solution by the addition of hexane. The red <b>supernatant</b> <b>liquor</b> containing CoFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles was separated by a separating funnel. The as-prepared cobalt ferrite could be deposited by adding ethanol and obtained by centrifugating at a high speed (10, 000 rpm) without any size-selecting process. The as-prepared samples could be well redispersed in a hexane solvent and stored for several months without delamination.|$|E
40|$|Membrane bioreactors (MBR) {{combine the}} {{activated}} sludge process with a membrane separation unit for biomass retention. Main advantages of MBR over conventional {{wastewater treatment plants}} are a smaller footprint due to higher biomass concentration {{and the absence of}} a clarifier, but also the production of a high quality effluent. Nevertheless, membrane fouling still is an obstacle for the economical operation of MBR systems. One promising strategy to reduce this fouling in MBR is to modify the sludge filtration characteristics by the addition of flocculants or adsorbents. Within the scope of this work 30 different chemicals were screened with regards to their potential for flux enhancement in MBR. Their impact on SMP (soluble microbial products) removal, particle size distribution and fouling propensity of the sludge was considered, but also their impact on the microorganisms (nutrient removal and respiration) and optimum concentrations were studied. The most promising chemicals were investigated in long-term trials in two identical parallel pilot MBR (1. 6 m³ and 22 m² membrane module each) fed on real municipal sewage. While flocculants were dosed into one system, the other served as a reference. Especially the synthetic polymers showed a high potential – in lab tests as well as in long-time pilot trials – as flux enhancers. However, their usage is limited by several patents. Metal salts might be an economic choice but can cause disturbances of the biomass. Also strong dosing effects (over- and underdosing) were observed. When adding a starch to a membrane system it must always be considered that as being a polysaccharide itself it is strongly suspect of causing fouling in the system. This was also observed in the pilot trials. As the starch was not bound to the flocs it permeated through the membrane and caused fouling. While chitosan strongly reduced the SMP concentration in mixed <b>liquor</b> <b>supernatant</b> and showed the best floc enlargement, the results of cross flow test cell trials showed no improvement of the apparent critical flux. Also the relatively high price of this product limits its application. For a conclusive rating of this substance further tests would be necessary. Activated carbon has been reported in literature for its positive effects on filtration. While synthetic polymers and starch mainly eliminated large molecular weight substances, the tested activated carbons were able to remove the whole range of molecular weight compounds. For activated carbons the activation method (physically or chemically) should be considered as it strongly influences the price. Also residuals from chemical activation were found to negatively impact the biomass in own trials. Commonly used shaker or jar tests are an efficient and quick tool to determine the optimum additive concentration. Several parameters such as SMP or TOC removal in supernatant or quick filterability or dewaterability tests can be used for an assessment. Interestingly, the optimum concentration in terms of SMP removal was also found to be the optimum for the cross flow test cell trials in all but one case. Nevertheless, long-term matrix effects can only be evaluated in pilot trials. Own studies showed that the lab-test results overestimate the effects of flux enhancers. Even elaborate test cell trials did not predict the filtration trends within the pilot plant rightly. E. g. the starch showed promising results in test cell trials, but was washed out and accelerated fouling in the pilot plant. Due to the broad range of tested substances and experimental set-ups used within this work the operating conditions (addition and mixing of the additives, mixed liquor properties such as MLSS concentration, pH, etc.) were not optimized for single substances and varied between the different experiments. Nevertheless, a comparable assessment would otherwise not have been possible. The different results in small- and pilot-scale might possibly be caused by these different conditions. Further research in these fields, especially in effective mixing methods for the activated sludge/additive system in larger scale is necessary...|$|R
40|$|The {{increased}} {{usage of}} water {{associated with an}} industrialized civilization {{has resulted in the}} accumulation of waste products in the natural watercourses. One of the manifest deteriorations in water quality has been the overgrowth of algae and other aquatic plants which have been attributed to the presence of increased concentrations of fertilizer constituents, particularly nitrogen and phosphorous. One source of fertilizer elements is in treated sewage effluents inasmuch as nitrogen and phosphorous are incompletely removed in conventional processes. Substantial research along various avenues is currently underway with the object of upgrading sewage treatment in respect to removal of fertilizer ingredients. Since phosphorous is a non volatile constituent, it is necessary to fix it into the solids fraction leaving the sewage treatment process which is not discharged to a watercourse. The precipitation of phosphate with lime has been demonstrated as effective in the fixing of the constituent in the solids fraction, but the process has been accompanied by voluminous, slow settling sludges. The research reported herein was undertaken to increase the general understanding of the lime precipitation process as it applies to digester <b>supernatant</b> <b>liquor</b> and to investigate particle nucleation as a technique for improving sludge settling and dewatering characteristics. It was the intention to provide designers with an increased measure of guidance in respect to the design of processes involving precipitation of phosphate wit...|$|E

The toxicity {{of this material}} is due to chemical and biological effects of high pH, alkalinity, electrical conductivity (EC), and Na+ and Al 3 + concentrations. Several neutralization techniques may allow BRR {{to be used for}} environmental remediation. The present study investigated standardized 48 -h acute toxicity tests with a freshwater cladoceran, Ceriodaphnia dubia, and a marine amphipod, Paracalliope australis, against raw supernatant BRR liquor (RL) versus liquors neutralized with acid (ANL), CO 2 (CNL), seawater (SNL), and a hybrid method (HNL). Based on 48 -h LC 50 values, the toxicity of the liquors to C. dubia increased in the following order; HNL ≤ SNL[*] 3 ̆c[*]ANL ≤ CNL[*] 3 ̆c[*]RL, with comparable responses from P. australis. The high toxicity of RL likely is due to high pH (∼ 12), alkalinity, and Al concentration. Toxicity of CNL likely is due to high EC and alkalinity. Sulfate and Na+ concentrations are considered sources of toxicity in ANL. Seawater-neutralized liquor and HNL were considerably less toxic to both test species. These data provide evidence of the acute lethal toxicity of raw <b>supernatant</b> <b>liquor</b> from BRR and four neutralized supernatant liquors to the freshwater cladoceran C. dubia and the marine amphipod P. australis, providing valuable baselines for further ecotoxicological investigations of BRR materials in aquatic environments.

40|$|EP 1050512 A UPAB: 20010110 NOVELTY - Before {{separation}} of the sludge, amphiphilic agents are added. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Preferred features: The addition converts the sludge into a state in which it settles under gravity into a compact sediment with clear <b>supernatant</b> <b>liquor.</b> Settlement under gravity continues for 1 hour, or preferably only 15 minutes. Following sedimentation, the liquid is separated by centrifugation. The sediment is then pressed to remove more liquid, which is intercepted. The solid phase is briquetted. The liquid phase is filtered, adding the solids arising, to the previously-separated solid phase. Amphiphilic agent is separated from the liquid and the solid phases by distillation and drying, respectively. It is then recycled, and/or purified by distillation. USE - A method especially suitable for fractionation of sludges, particularly inorganic sludges arising in lapping and honing operations. ADVANTAGE - Complete, immediate {{separation of}} such sludges is not possible. The new process avoids disposal and incineration, offering a method recovering both fluid and solid. Abrasives recovered include e. g. silicon carbide, boron nitride, corundum and/or diamond particles. These comparatively valuable substances can be re-used. Addition of low viscosity lipophiles is ineffective; only by use of short chain amphiphiles is the dispersion significantly de-stabilized, resulting in compact sedimentation under gravity, leaving clear, oil-containing supernatant liquid above. Conventional processes complete preparation of the separated fractions. The method is particularly suitable for sludges containing stable dispersions of oil and emulsifiers, as with lapping and honing abrasives. The viscosity is comparatively high, making conventional separations ineffective. Examples, and comparative tables of results are included in this disclosure...|$|E

Moreover, although {{it is clear that}} the citric acid generated by fungi could be an important leaching agent acting in the solubilization of the used silicates, other products of metabolism could be involved. Related to this, the results obtained with chemical leaching using low concentrations of citric acid _lower than 10 mM. showed, for both calamine and garnierite, that the respective dissolution of zinc and nickel was much lower when compared to those processes in which cultures or <b>supernatant</b> <b>liquor</b> of A. niger cultures were used and in which the maximum concentration of citric acid was 8 mM. The results obtained also suggest that the type of mineral _andror the metal present in it. presents a different susceptibility to the bioleaching process and also demonstrate that depending of the situation, the presence of the fungi cells seem to improve the leaching process. From a practical point of view, the high yield rate of extracting metals from silicates obtained by using for example, supernatant liquors of A. niger cultures, is noteworthy. This bioleaching process present two advantages as compared to conventional chemical leaching processes: _a. the very low concentrations of organic compounds present in such a situation represent a lower ecological risk; and _b. even with a lower final yield, the economical cost of a such process.

40|$|Using a {{comparative}} study, this research investigates {{the foundation for}} phosphorus (P) recycling (and reuse in agriculture) in two Danish urban areas (Copenhagen, and Roskilde), via selected nutrient recycling stakeholders (Wastewater Treatment Plants - WWTP). The Sewage treatment works (STW) chosen for the study are Avedøre WWTP (Copenhagen) operated by BIOFOS A/S, and Bjergmarken WWTP (Roskilde) operated by Forsyning Roskilde A/S. The STW selected for the study were chosen due to the timespan available for the master thesis research, and the consideration of other stakeholders involved in the phosphorus recycling agenda. The results show that phosphorus recycling is proactively being pursued in Roskilde, compared to Copenhagen. Avedøre WWTP incinerates sewage sludge (containing the p), and the resulting ash is deposited on site within their facility while the Bjergmarken WWTP recycles phosphorus via drying and pelletizing sewage sludge. Pelletized sludge is distributed to farmers, inherently contributing to the nutrients available for their agricultural activities. Momentarily, the STWs are enhanced for sanitation but not optimized for nutrient recycling, {{and there is a}} growing call for a shift in wastewater treatment paradigm (from the conventional sanitation model to a sanitation and recovery model). A potentially promising option for phosphorus recycling optimization within the STW could be achieved through controlled struvite precipitation. Struvite (magnesium- ammonium-phosphate hexahydrate - Mg·NH 4 ·PO 4 · 6 H 2 O) can be precipitated with the <b>supernatant</b> <b>liquor</b> from the sludge dewatering centrifuge, using a supplementary addition of magnesium. Also, sludge gasification produces a residue {{that can be used for}} agricultural purposes. Furthermore, decentralized phosphorus recycling alternatives are feasible, and can be achieved through urine separation at the source for direct use or struvite precipitation.

40|$|Problem statement: The {{isolation}} of Humic Acids (HA) from coal is laborious, costly and time consuming. The extraction and fractionation periods of HA vary from 4 h to 7 days. Fractionation period ranges from 12 - 24 h. However, most studies use 24 h as extraction period and also 24 h as fractionation period. This {{study was conducted}} to investigate whether the isolation period for HA of coals could be reduced. Approach: Different extraction periods using 0. 1 M NaOH (4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h) were tested. Samples were centrifuged (16, 211 G for 15 min) {{at the end of each}} extraction period. The dark-colored <b>supernatant</b> <b>liquor</b> containing HA was decanted and the pH of solution was adjusted to 1. 0 using 6 M HCl. After acidification, the fractionation periods evaluated were 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h. The samples were transferred to a polyethylene bottle and centrifuged (16, 211 G for 10 min) after each fractionation period. The HA purification was done by suspending them in 50 mL distilled water and centrifuged (16, 211 G for 10 min). HA samples were dried in an oven at 40 °C to a constant weight. Standard procedures were used to characterized the HA (total carbon, E 4 /E 6, phenolic OH, carboxylic COOH and total acidity). Results: There was significant effect of both extraction and fractionation periods on the {{isolation of}} HA from coal. The optimum period for Na ions to saturate the exchange complex of HA during the extraction process was 8 h while the optimum period for the exchanges sites of the HA to be saturated with H ions during the fractionation process was 20 h. The distilled water used in this study was able to purify HA within 1 h because it served as Bronsted-Lowry acid. Additionally, carbon, E 4 /E 6, phenolic OH, carboxylic COOH and total acidity of the HA were typical of those reported in the literature, suggesting that that the isolation process of the HA was successful. Conclusion: The isolation period of HA from coal can be reduced to 29 h (8 h extraction, 20 h fractionation period and 1 h purification period) instead of the existing range of 2 - 7 days...|$|E
40|$|Economically exploitable {{phosphate}} ore {{resources are}} finite and non-renewable. Due {{to the fact}} that phosphorus is, besides nitrogen, the main nutrient for plant growth, most of the phosphorus world-wide is used for the production of mineral fertilisers. Because of the increasing world population the demand for phosphorus will increase as well. Phosphates cannot be substituted by other substances as far as plant nutrition is concerned; thus we are faced with an increasing scarcity of this raw material. Even nowadays, deposits with increasing pollutants and decreasing phosphate concentrations are exploited. In Germany, at least a part of agricultural phosphate demand is fulfilled by phosphates contained in the sewage sludge from waste water treatment. But within the last few years, agricultural utilisation of the sludge has become less important. Further reductions are expected by the amendment of the German Sewage Sludge Regulation, which is up for discussion. Hence, the gap between agricultural phosphate demand and the contribution of sewage sludge to fulfil this demand will rise. The PRISA process, which has been developed and tested within this dissertation, enables a recycling of phosphorus to agriculture that is independent of the sludge disposal. The process is based on well-known techniques of municipal wastewater treatment plants (wwtp) and can easily be integrated into existing wwtps. The first step of the PRISA process is the feeding of the pre-thickener with excess sludge of a wwtp with enhanced biological phosphorus removal. This thickener is operated with a longer hydraulic retention time and the sludge is mixed periodically by recirculation. Due to a longer retention time and the anaerobic conditions in the thickener, the release of phosphorus, which has been bound biologically, is higher than in conventional thickeners. Periodical mixing ensures the transfer of released phosphates into the <b>supernatant</b> <b>liquor.</b> This is mixed with the sludge liquor from post-thickening and mechanical dewatering. Solids become removed from the nutrient-rich process water and in a coagulation and crystallisation reactor, phosphate is recovered as magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP, struvite). Finally, the valuable phosphate product is dewatered by bag filter housings. The following results have been gained from the scientific pilot scale examination of the PRISA process in detail:- By a three-day hydraulic retention time in the pre-thickener and a mixing of the sludge once or twice a day, 20 % of the phosphorus that was in the inflow to the wwtp can be released. - The total load in sludge liquor amounts to approx. 0. 7 g P/(I•d). - For MAP crystallisation, magnesium oxide (Mg:P = 1. 5 : 1. 0) as reaction agent and caustic soda in order to optimise the pH value (pH= 9. 5) are added to the sludge liquor. In total, in the coagulation and crystallisation reactor 60 minutes hydraulic retention time is necessary for a phosphate removal efficiency of > 90 % at optimised settings. Finally, using the PRISA process, 30 % of the phosphorus inflow load to the wwtp can be recovered as secondary phosphate. - Concentrations of the examined heavy metals (lead, cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, zinc, mercury and uranium) and organic pollutants (musk compounds, organic tin compounds, surfactants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) are lower than in sewage sludge. The concentrations fulfil the actual limit values and the stricter limit values that are supposed to become valid by the novel Sewage Sludge Regulation. The pollutants in the secondary phosphate present no obstacle for its use as fertiliser in agriculture. - The technical devices that are necessary for the PRISA process are standard equipment for municipal wwtps. The operation of the process and the exposure to the chemicals needed, are – compared to other processes for phosphate recovery – not complicated and easily handled by wwtp staff. - A municipal wwtp with a capacity of 100, 000 I integrating and using the PRISA process will be faced with annual costs (capital and operation costs) between 1. 34 €/(I•a) and 1. 60 €/(I•a) after revenues. Costs of wastewater treatment would rise by approx. 0. 04 €/m³ treated wastewater...|$|E
