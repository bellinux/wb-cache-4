2500|$|Around about 1910 the Borough Police {{acquired}} four police horses. They {{were purchased}} {{and used for}} crowd control with the horses being stabled in the yard at the Harrison Road Police Station, having their names over their stable doors. Four horses were photographed in the Mounted Police Section in 1930 {{as part of the}} annual inspection of the Halifax Borough Police of that year by Sir Llewelyn Atcherley, His Majesty's Inspector of Police, with Chief Constable Richardson. The Suffragettes were holding meetings that often ended with crowd trouble and there were many strikes at local works and on the railways in the offing at Halifax. A year later a car was purchased for Halifax police use and bicycle use had reached a peak by this time. Also, a motorbike and sidecar unit was formed and based at Harrison Road. 1911 saw the first national census when the householder presented the census form as opposed to giving verbal details to an enumerator. On 18 May 1912 there was a special meeting of the Watch Committee and it was resolved 'That the Police Standing Orders be reprinted as amended and re-published to the Force.' This was an update of the booklet published on 7 May 1906 and reflected the improved conditions of the Police Force and reaffirmed that the Force could know the regulations to which it was their duty to conform. On 11 July 1912 King George V and Queen Mary visited Clough Mill, a factory site near Halifax. This entailed a heavy police presence and a large amount of police activity to ensure their security. Alfred Richardson was later to become recognised for a particular police <b>security</b> <b>procedure</b> he created for this event which had the security and police activity highly organised. Always involved with Police Pensions, Alfred Richardson added to the Family Archives a newspaper article from Sheffield where a Quarter Sessions Judge gave police officers consideration where the house, free gas and coal were supplied when calculating that officer's pension. At the outbreak of the First World War he joined up as a Territorial, in the Duke of Wellington's Regiment which had a long-standing association with Halifax. He was the Assistant Provost Marshall and given the rank of Major. Alfred Richardson {{was in charge of the}} Harrow Dog Kennels near Halifax, which provided dogs for the war effort. During the early days of World War I, Chief Constable Alfred Herbert Richardson was in charge of the kennels. They provided dogs for use in the trenches, for scouting with soldiers and for use in sentry duty at isolated posts. [...] In 1914, he served with the 4th Battalion Duke of Wellington's Regiment and as a Major was the Halifax Recruiting Officer with the Regiment.|$|E

The best first step, however, that can be taken by any payee who has concerns about the validity of any traveler's cheque, is to contact the issuer directly; a negative finding by a third-party cheque verification service based on an ID check may merely indicate that the service has no record about the purchaser (to be expected, practically by definition, of many travelers), or at worst that they have been deemed incompetent to manage a personal chequing account (which would have no bearing on the validity of a traveler's cheque).|$|E

Stella is hurt when Lindsay refuses {{to share her}} troubles in episode 312, [...] "Silent Night", but when Lindsay later comes to her and asks for a friend, Stella responds immediately, [...] "You've got one." [...] When Lindsay must return to Montana to testify in a murder trial, Stella, not Mac, is the one she informs first. Just {{a few minutes before}} the trial begins, Lindsay calls her to talk to her and Stella comforts her. Stella also shows a fondness for Lindsay's enthusiastic explanations of evidence and occasional demonstrations, usually with a remark along the lines of [...] "I love it when she does this." [...] She also gave Lindsay a form of assurance that she has good coworkers, who will understand and be happy for her, when in her anxiousness over her pregnancy and getting exposed to chemical substances in the lab, the younger woman asks her about the <b>security</b> <b>procedure</b> for a pregnant friend of her in Jersey. At the end of the conversation, Stella said to Lindsay to tell her friend [...] "congratulations", indicating that she knows that Lindsay is actually the one who was pregnant. When Lindsay and Danny got married in episode 517, [...] "Green Piece", Stella and Mac were there as witnesses.|$|E
5000|$|On site, {{when she}} and Jimbo are {{attempting}} to sneak into the White House, they are halted by guards and Liza uses her powers {{for the two of}} them to escape. This triggering an alarm and initiates a <b>security</b> <b>procedure</b> where everybody in the Oval Office (including the finalists of American Genius) must get to safety in a security bunker. But once inside and all exits are sealed, the four gifted teenagers manipulate the soldiers and bodyguards into killing each other, and Melanie is shot dead under Gil’s will. Gil then begins the attacks by launching a nuke at Killian University, where Jimbo and Killian worked. Ann’s life is spared when Sammy raises the possibility that her child, being Jimbo’s as well, might also be a [...] "golden child". Jimbo eventually arrives at the bunker with Liza, where he learns that Gil is the one leading the group into attacking the US. A fight ensues where Gil attacks Ann and Jimbo fights to protect her, until the fifth contestant fires a gun at Gil when Jimbo is at the verge of being killed. But Jimbo, anticipating the bullet, pushes Gil away and instead receives the bullet in his heart. While Jimbo lies in Ann’s arms, dying, Gil horribly attacks Liza for her refusal to cooperate with him, which brings Harry to his senses and convinces his friends to stop all the madness of attacking and killing masses of people across the United States. And so, while one controls Gil in order to prevent him from stopping them, Harry cancels the nuclear attack, saving Killian University by seconds. Shortly afterwards, Jimbo takes his final breath.|$|E
