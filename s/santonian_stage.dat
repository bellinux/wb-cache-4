25|$|The {{remains of}} Achillobator were {{recovered}} in the Bayan Shireh Formation of Dornogovi Province, Mongolia, in fine-grained, medium sandstone/gray mudstone that was deposited during the Late Cretaceous epoch. The exact age is uncertain, with two competing hypotheses; based on comparisons with other formations, the Bayan Shireh fauna seems to correspond best with the Turonian through early Campanian {{stages of the}} Late Cretaceous, about 93 to 80 million years ago. However, examination of the magnetostratigraphy of the formation seems {{to confirm that the}} entire Bayan Shireh lies within the Cretaceous Long Normal, which lasted only {{until the end of the}} <b>Santonian</b> <b>stage,</b> giving a possible Cenomanian through Santonian age, or between 98 and 83 million years ago.|$|E
500|$|The {{biogeography}} {{and early}} evolutionary history of pachycephalosaurs is poorly understood, {{and can only}} be clarified by new discoveries. Pachycephalosaurs appear abruptly in the fossil record, and are present in both North America and Asia, so it is unknown when they first originated, and from which direction they dispersed. The oldest known {{members of the group}} (such as Acrotholus) are [...] "fully domed" [...] and known from the <b>Santonian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Late Cretaceous period (about 84 million years ago). This is before the supposedly more primitive Stegoceras from the Middle Campanian (77 million years ago) and Homalocephale from the Early Maastrichtian (70 million years ago), so the doming of the skull may be a homoplastic trait (a form of convergent evolution). The late occurrence of pachycephalosaurs compared to the related ceratopsians indicates a long ghost lineage (inferred, but missing from the fossil record) spanning 66 million years, from the Late Jurassic to the Cretaceous. Since pachycephalosaurs were mainly small, {{this may be due to}} taphonomic bias; smaller animals are less likely to be preserved through fossilisation. More delicate bones are also less likely to be preserved, which is why pachycephalosaurs are mainly known from their robust skulls.|$|E

It was collected from the Adamantina Formation of the Bauru Basin, which dates to the Turonian and <b>Santonian</b> <b>stages</b> of the Late Cretaceous.|$|R
5000|$|Albisaurus (meaning [...] "Albis River lizard") {{was once}} thought to be a genus of dinosaur, but is now thought to be a non-dinosaurian archosaur. It was first {{described}} by Antonin Fritsch (also spelt Frič), a Czech palaeontologist, in 1893, but the remains are sparse. The validity of the species cannot be proven based on the fossil remains, and it is usually marked as a nomen dubium.

50|$|The eroded {{sandstone}} {{landscape of}} this region was formed from depositions that accumulated {{on the bottom of}} the sea millions of years ago. Large rivers carried sand and other eroded debris into the Cretaceous sea. Rough quartz sand, clay and fine marl sank and became lithified layer by layer. A compact sandstone sequence developed, about 20 x 30 kilometres wide and up to 600 metres thick dating to the lower Cenomanian to <b>Santonian</b> <b>stages.</b> The tremendous variety of shapes in the sandstone landscape is a result of the subsequent chemical and physical erosion and biological processes acting on the rocks formed from those sands laid down during the Cretaceous Period.|$|R
50|$|Baurusuchus is an extinct genus of baurusuchid mesoeucrocodylian {{from the}} Late Cretaceous of Brazil. It was a {{terrestrial}} predator and scavenger, about 3.5 to 4 m long and 80 kg in weight. Baurusuchus lived during the Turonian to <b>Santonian</b> <b>stages</b> (90-83.5 million years ago) of the Late Cretaceous Period, in Adamantina Formation, Brazil. It gets {{its name from}} the Brazilian Bauru Group ("Bauru crocodile"). It was related to the earlier-named Cynodontosuchus rothi, which was smaller, with weaker dentition. The three species are B. pachechoi, named after Eng Joviano Pacheco, its descoverer, B. salgadoensis (named after General Salgado County in São Paulo, Brazil) and B. albertoi (named after Dr. Alberto Barbosa de Carvalho, Brazilian paleontologist). The latter species is disputed (see phylogeny section). Its relatives include the similarly sized Stratiotosuchus from the Adamantina Formation, and Pabweshi, from the Pakistani Pab Formation.|$|R

The holotype came from the sixth fossiliferous spot, whereas the paratype came from the third spot, of an unnamed formation, dating to the <b>Santonian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Late Cretaceous period, about 85.8-83.5 million years ago.|$|E
5000|$|Species of this genus were {{fast-moving}} nektonic carnivorous shelled cephalopods. They lived {{during the}} Cretaceous, from the Albian (112.0-99.6 Mya) to the <b>Santonian</b> (85.8-83.5 Mya) <b>stage.</b>|$|R
5|$|Additional {{excavations}} since 1998 {{have revealed}} additional skeletal elements belonging to Eolambia. It {{is now the}} most completely-known iguanodont from between the Cenomanian and <b>Santonian</b> <b>stages.</b> Nearly every single skeletal element belonging to the taxon is represented by multiple fossils across existing collections. At least twelve individuals, including at least eight juveniles, were discovered in a quarry south {{of the town of}} Emery, including parts from both the skull {{and the rest of the}} body. The quarry is known as the Cifelli #2 Eolambia caroljonesa Quarry, or more formally CEUM locality 42em432v. Another quarry south of the town of Emery – the Willow Springs 8 quarry, or CEUM locality 42Em576v – preserves at least four juveniles. Material from these quarries was described in 2012 by Kirkland along with Andrew McDonald, John Bird, and Peter Dodson, who also provided an updated diagnosis for Eolambia based on this material.|$|R

5000|$|Pannoniasaurus is an extinct genus of tethysaurine mosasauroid {{known from}} the Late Cretaceous Csehbánya Formation (<b>Santonian</b> <b>stage)</b> of Hungary. It {{contains}} a single species, Pannoniasaurus inexpectatus, dubbed [...] "unexpected" [...] because it was discovered in freshwater sediments, unlike other mosasaurs, which were marine predators. It was a medium sized mosasaur, reaching up to 6 m.|$|E
50|$|Dinosaur remains {{are among}} the fossils that have been {{recovered}} from the Adamantina Formation. According to most studies, the Adamantina Formation dates from the Turonian to the <b>Santonian</b> <b>stage</b> (90-83.5 million years ago) of the late Cretaceous, although some studies found much younger age - Campanian to Maastrichtian (83.5-66 million years ago) of the late Cretaceous.|$|E
40|$|Erosional {{surfaces}} {{are present in}} middle and upper Coniacian rocks in Montana and Alberta, and probably {{at the base of}} the middle Santonian in the Western Interior of Canada. These erosional {{surfaces are}} biostratigraphically constrained using inoceramid bivalves and ammonites, which are used to define lower, middle, and upper substages of both the Coniacian and <b>Santonian</b> <b>stages</b> of the Upper Cretaceous in this region. The most detailed biostratigraphy associated with these erosional surfaces concerns the MacGowan Concretionary Bed in the Kevin Member of the Marias River Shale in Montana, where the bed lies disconformably on middle or lowermost upper Coniacian strata, and is overlain by upper Coniacian beds. Surface and subsurface investigations in west-central Alberta reveal that the Bad Heart Formation, bounded by unconformities, is about the age of the MacGowan Concretionary Bed. Coniacian and Santonian strata are present elsewhere in Alberta and adjoining areas, but little has been published concerning the Santonian megafossils...|$|R

40|$|A {{detailed}} carbon- and oxygen-isotope stratigraphy {{has been}} generated from Upper Cretaceous coastal Chalk sections in southern England (East Kent; Culver Cliff, Isle of Wight; Eastbourne and Seaford Head, Sussex; Norfolk Coast) and the British Geological Survey (BGS) Trunch borehole, Norfolk. Data are also presented from a section through the Scaglia facies exposed near Gubbio, Italian Apennines. Wherever possible the sampling interval {{has been one}} metre or less. Both the Chalk and Scaglia carbon-isotopic curves show minor positive excursions in the mid-Cenomanian, mid- and high Turonian, basal Coniacian and highest Santonian-lowest Campanian; there is a negative excursion high in the Campanian in Chalk sections that span that interval. The well-documented Cenomanian-Turonian boundary 'spike' is also well displayed, as is a broad positive excursion centred on the upper Coniacian. A number of these positive excursions correlate with records of organic-carbon-rich deposition in the Atlantic Ocean and elsewhere. The remarkable similarity in the carbon-isotope curves from England and Italy enables cross-referencing of macrofossil and microfossil zones and pinpoints considerable discrepancy in the relative positions of the Turonian, Coniacian and <b>Santonian</b> <b>stages.</b> The oxygen-isotope values of the various Chalk sections, although showing different absolute values that are presumably diagenesis-dependent, show nonetheless a consistent trend. The East Kent section, which is very poorly lithified, indicates a warming up to the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary interval, then cooling thereafter. Regional organic-carbon burial, documented for this period, is credited with causing drawdown of CO 2 and initiating climatic deterioration (inverse greenhouse effect). Data {{from other parts of}} the world are consistent with the hypothesis that the Cenomanian-Turonian temperature optimum was a global phenomenon and that this interval represents a major turning point in the climatic history of the earth.

40|$|Ostracod assemblages from samples {{collected}} {{through the}} Turonian Stage of the Late Cretaceous from Dover, Kent, south-east England, consist {{of one hundred}} and three species group taxa. These are described and illustrated. This represents {{a significant increase in}} the knowledge of the Turonian fauna, since previous estimates of the number of species present during the Turonian are less than thirty. This improvement has been brought about by the selection of an appropriate processing method. Freeze-thaw processing is recommended for chalks and hardgrounds which comprise much of the Turonian Stage. The white spirit, solvent method is shown to be preferable for marls. Nineteen species and six subspecies are here described as new: Polycope lunaplena sp. nov, Cytherella truncatoides sp. nov., Cytherella vulna sp. nov., Cytherella weaveri sp. nov., Cytherelloidea granulosa parca ssp. nov., Cardobairdia longitecta sp. nov., Bairdoppilata turonica sp. nov., Pontocyprella robusta cometa ssp. nov., Pterygocythereis (Diogmopteron) carolinae sp. nov., Bythoceratina (Bythoceratina) saxa sp. nov., Bythoceratina (Bythoceratina) staringi conmacula ssp. nov., Monoceratina minangulata sp. nov., Patellacythere weaveris sp. nov., Schulerides langdonensis sp. nov., Karsteneis nodifera tabasca ssp. nov., Karsteneis oculocosta sp. nov., Karsteneis petasus petasus sp. et ssp. nov., Karsteneis petasus antecursor sp. et ssp. nov., Karsteneis praekarsteni sp. nov., Idiocythere carburnensis sp. nov., Isocythereis postelongata sp. nov., Mauritsina? paradordoniensis sp. nov., Rehacythereis stellatus sp. nov., Rehacythereis venticursus venticursus sp. et ssp. nov., Rehacythereis venticursus patbrowni sp. et ssp. nov., and one new name, Bythoceratina (Bythocertatina) antetumida nom. nov. is introduced for a secondary junior homonym. By comparison with faunas from Devon and the Czech Republic, the biostratigraphical analysis is shown to only have only local significance due to diachronism of Ostracoda. This diachronism is used to explore migration pathways which suggest that the origin of the Turonian ostracod fauna may have had more than one source. A model relating ostracod diversity inversely to sea-level is given for the Cenomanian to <b>Santonian</b> <b>stages</b> of the Late Cretaceous which suggests that the sea-level at Dover during the Turonian was greater than previously thought, given its marginal setting...|$|R
