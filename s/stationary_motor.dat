This decreases noise because the motor is the main source of noise in this train system. With the motor separate from the train cars, noise in the cars and tunnel will be minimized. Another advantage of this system is that a separate motor results in less mechanical parts in the car, which also mean less repairs on the actual train cars.|$|E

In Experiment 1, motion perception of a blinking bar was shifted {{in the direction of}} co-occurring hand motor movements, indicative of motor-induced visual motion (MIVM). In Experiment 2, moving and static blinking bars were combined with either directional moving or stationary hand motor movements.

In Experiment 3, the role of response bias was excluded in a two-alternative forced-choice task that ruled out the effect of response strategies. All three experiments demonstrated that alternating key presses (either horizontally or vertically aligned) induce illusory visual motion and that <b>stationary</b> <b>motor</b> movements (without a vertical or horizontal direction) induce the opposite effect, namely a decline in visual motion (more static) perception.

As opposed to earlier work 13 DCB, the motors are disordered, i. e. the mechanical torque applied to the motors varies in a random manner along the circuit. In spite of the disorder, many of the qualitative features of a homogenous circuit persist, e. g. long-range motor-motor interactions mediated by circuit voltage and electrical power flows result in coexistence of the spatially-extended and propagating normal and stalled phases.

40|$|Purpose] It {{is common}} to avoid exercising for a while after eating, but we {{sometimes}} exercise shortly after eating, without taking enough rest in our daily lives, for health maintenance and promotion. [Subjects and Methods] We studied the effects of food intake on metabolism and heart rate during moderate exercise in 12 healthy men. The subjects consumed 571 kcal food, and pedalled bicycles at 60 % peak V̇o 2 for 15 minutes under two conditions, 30 minutes and 2 hours after eating. [Results] The oxygen intake, heart rate and oxygen pulse during exercise did not show {{significant differences between the}} postprandial conditions. As the energy metabolism estimated by gas exchange ratio, carbohydrate metabolism was predominant in the early exercise condition of 30 minutes after eating, and showed a delay in recovering the <b>stationary</b> <b>motor</b> condition compared to 2 hours after eating. [Conclusion] When we exercise shortly after eating, performing a certain level of warm-up exercise is important so that the metabolic responsiveness of primary exercise can be adjusted. 要旨: ［目的］食後しばらくの間は運動を控えるのが一般的であるが，健康維持・増進のため，日常生活において食後十分な休憩をとらずに運動する場合がある。［対象と方法］健常男性 12 名を対象に中等度運動時における食後の影響を代謝と心拍数から検討した。対象者は 571 kcalの試験食をとり，食後 30 分と食後 2 時間の 2 条件下で 60 % peak Vo 2 強度の自転車漕ぎ運動を 15 分間行った。［結果］運動時の酸素摂取量，心拍数，酸素脈は食後条件間で有意な違いは認められなかった。ガス交換比から推定されるエネルギー代謝は，食後 30 分条件では運動初期に糖質代謝が優位であり，食後 2 時間条件に比べて運動時定常状態に至るまでに遅れがみられた。［結語］食後間もない時間帯に運動を行う場合，主運動における代謝応答が調整される程度に十分なウォーミングアップがより重要になると考えられた...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} Monoxide (CO) Poisoning is a colorless, — Continued odorless, {{toxic gas}} {{that is a}} product of incomplete combustion. Motor vehicles, heaters, and appliances that use carbon-based fuels are the main sources of this poison. Most fatal unintentional CO poisonings associated with motor vehicles are preventable and can result from differing mechanisms of exposure: 1) operation of a motor vehicle with a damaged or malfunctioning exhaust system and an inadequately ventilated passenger compartment, 2) operation of a motor vehicle in an enclosed space (e. g., a garage) with inadequate ventilation, and 3) use of auxiliary fuel-burning heaters inside a passenger compartment or in a camper (1 – 8).

40|$|Isometric {{compensation}} of predictably frequency-modulated low forces {{is associated with}} corticomuscular coherence (CMC) in beta and low gamma range. It remains unclear how the CMC is influenced by unpredictably modulated forces which create a mismatch between expected and actual sensory feedback. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) from the contralateral hand motor area, electromyography (EMG) and the motor performance of 16 subjects during a visuomotor task {{in which they had}} to isometrically compensate target forces at 8 % of the maximum voluntary contraction with their right index finger.

Due to its amphiphilic character, this complex can be solubilized in non-polar fuels, thus generating cerium(IV) oxide particles, which efficiently catalyze the oxidation of diesel/biodiesel soot. The synthesized complex was characterized by microanalysis (C, H), thermal analysis, and infrared spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, and specific surface area measurements attested that the complex {{can act as a}} soluble precursor of homogeneous CeO(2) spherical nanoparticles. The efficiency of this compound as catalyst for the reduction of soot emission was evaluated through static studies (comprising carbon black oxidation), which confirmed that increasing concentrations of the complex result in lower carbon black oxidation temperatures and lower activation Gibbs free energies.

40|$|A spatial cueing {{paradigm}} {{was used}} to (a) ~vestigate the eflects of attentional orienting on spatial and temporal parameters of saccadic eye movements and (b) examine hypotheses regarding the &erurchical programing of saccaa% direction and amplitude. On a given trial, the subjects were presented with one of three peripheral cues: a “valid” cue provided correct information, a “neutral” cue no information and an “invalid” cue incorrect information about {{the location of the}} subsequent target (the cue was valid on about 50 % of the trials). 100 or 5 OOmsec after the cue onset (stimulus onset asynchrony, SOA), the eye movement target was presented at one of six possible locations (from - 11. 25 ” to + I 1. 25 O, at 3. 15 ” spacing). The results showed a significant egect of cueing on saccade luten~ies at the IOOmsec, but no eflect at the 5 OOmsec SOA. The cueing bene~ts were restricted to the cued location; no other locations within the cued or uncued hemi-meld were fa&ilitated. The invalid trial latencies showed: (a) no advantage for targets on the same side as the cue relative to the opposite side, (b) no advantage for targets more proximal to the cue and (c) no advantage for targets sharing the same eccentricity as the cue. In a second experiment, subjects responded to the target by giving a simple manual response [simple reaction time (RT) ] while keeping the eyes stationary. The results showed a significant cueing e#ect on simple RTs both at the IOOmsec and, in contrast to saccadic eye movements, the 5 OOmsec SOA. There were spect$c benefits for targets at the cued location relative to other targets within the same and opposite hemi-cell. Further, in contrast to saccades, there was a general advantage for targets within the same (‘%ued”) hemi-$eld over targets in the opposite hem&field.
