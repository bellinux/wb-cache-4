40|$|Photograph of Ninth Street Bridge showing cracks, showing {{cars on the}} bridge, [s. d. ]. In the {{foreground}} at right, <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> of <b>the</b> bridge can be seen. The stone casing {{on the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> is noticeably cracked. A section of the casing near a small column of <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> is nearly removed from the rest of <b>the</b> <b>railing.</b> In <b>the</b> background, small lampposts are visible along <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> of bridge. To the left, the wide bridge is visible extending into the extreme background. In the background, several automobiles can be seen moving along the bridge. To the far right of the bridge, a wired fence separates an area containing piles of wood and scrap metal. Large buildings {{can be seen in the}} extreme background at right.

40|$|It was {{observed}} that wind-induced vibrations had created destructive effects on corner balcony railings in an oceanfront condominium building. The vibrations of <b>the</b> <b>railings</b> caused disconnections of welds {{at the ends}} of the pickets, and noise was generated, which created discomfort to the residents of the building. This work presents a method to mitigate the wind-induced vibrations and noise of <b>the</b> balcony <b>railings.</b> <b>The</b> noise generation mechanisms were investigated; buffeting and vortex-induced vibration were identified as the two main mechanisms. A finite element (FE) model of a railing was developed using commercial FE software ABAQUS. The FE model was validated by modal testing results and used as a basis for later modifications. Design modifications were made for <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> and simulated using ABAQUS; increasing the stiffness of <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> was proposed as a solution based on the FE simulation results and the constraints imposed. A modified railing was installed on one of the corner balconies according to the solution and tested. The experimental results and on-site monitoring on <b>the</b> modified <b>railing</b> indicate that <b>the</b> noise issue has been resolved, and all of <b>the</b> affected <b>railings</b> were demolished and replaced with <b>the</b> modified <b>railings...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The total {{minimum height}} {{required}} varies per building codes {{depending on the}} area and target use of either residential or commercial. Local city codes supersede state, national and international code. In most states, the residential code is 36” high. There are some exceptions though like in California [...] the required height for residential railing is 42” [...] On the other hand, the commercial International Building Code requires <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> {{to be at a}} minimum of 42” height. Posts can be floor mounted or fascia/side mounted but the height of <b>the</b> <b>railing</b> is measured from the floor to the top of <b>the</b> <b>railing.</b>|$|R
