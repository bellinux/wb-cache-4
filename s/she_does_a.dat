5|$|Love's {{design process}} {{has become more}} refined as time goes on. For Digital, she did not plan {{anything}} in advance; while for Analogue, she worked out the entire design and pacing game in flowcharts before starting. For all of her games, however, <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> lot of research into the time periods and issues involved. Love does not feel that text is necessarily {{the best way to}} tell a story in a game, but finds it easier to communicate with it as a writer.|$|E

25|$|Sullivan {{writes that}} Devlin sets up Alicia as sexual bait, refuses {{to take any}} {{responsibility}} for his role, then feels devastated when <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> superb job. Alicia finds herself coldly manipulated by the man she loves, sees her notorious behavior exploited for political purposes, then fears abandonment by the lover who {{put her in the}} excruciating predicament of spying on her late father's Nazi colleague by sleeping with him—a man who genuinely loves her, perhaps more than Devlin does. Alex is Hitchcock's most painfully sympathetic villain, driven by his profound jealousy and rage—not to mention his enthrallment to an emasculating mother—culminating in an abrupt, absolute imperative to kill the love of his life.|$|E

500|$|Whenever we work {{together}} she always sits with me and listens to the song, and says [...] "tell me what this song is about to you." [...] She's very methodical in her thinking. We talk about it, she writes down words that I say describing what the song's about and the sentiment that I'd like her to get out there, and then she goes away and she works on it. She writes it, she comes back. <b>She</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> version of it, we talk about it. It's a back and forth until she gets it right. It's a total collaboration.|$|E

Allen described her as [...] "a naturally funny person. When <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> scene, {{you listen to}} her and look at her, and the prism through which it's all filtered is funny." [...] Kavner believes he is [...] "a true filmmaker, one that has something to say, continually experimenting on different themes within his own film-making", adding that [...] "anything [...] ever does, I always want to do, [...] I don't even have to read it." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2004 she starred as TV {{journalist}} Romila Dutta in Farhan Akhtar's war drama Lakshya, alongside Hrithik Roshan. The {{film was}} based on the historical events of the 1999 Kargil War; Zinta's character was modelled after TV journalist Barkha Dutt, the only female reporter who covered the conflict. The film was a critical success, yet her performance received mixed reviews; Namarata Joshi of Outlook likened her to [...] "a teenybopper trying to do a TV newsreading skit for her college fest" [...] and Rediff.com concluded, [...] "Zinta has quite a good role and a good deal of footage in the film, and <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> fairly decent job of it without ever being spectacular." [...] Later that year, Yash Chopra cast her opposite Shahrukh Khan as the female lead in the love saga Veer-Zaara, the top-grossing Hindi film of that year both in India and abroad, with revenues of over [...] worldwide. The film, which relates the love story of an Indian officer, Veer Pratap Singh, and a Pakistani woman, Zaara Haayat Khan, had a strong international release, including a screening at the Berlin Film Festival, and won several Best Movie awards at major Indian award functions. For her portrayal of Zaara, a role which required her to master the fine nuances of the Urdu language, Zinta received her fourth Filmfare Best Actress nomination. Variety hailed her as [...] "the most interesting young actress of her generation," [...] writing that she [...] "is her usual lively self as thewillful Zaara." [...] Veer-Zaara was Zinta's second highest-grossing film and third major success in two consecutive years.

I'm actually happier she did it than I did it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, she starred {{opposite}} Luke Wilson in My Super Ex-Girlfriend, {{playing a}} superhero who is dumped by her boyfriend and then takes her revenge upon him. She received $14 {{million for the}} role, but the film was panned by critics and made a modest US$61 million worldwide. Entertainment Weekly {{felt that it was}} a [...] "miscalculation to make Thurman the antagonist. <b>She</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> sprightly satiric turn, but [...] wasted in a movie that would rather tweak male paranoia than liberate a nerdette terrified of her powers". In the 2007 film The Life Before Her Eyes, Thurman starred as an accident survivor whose guilt causes her present-day life to fall apart. It received a limited theatrical release and was dismissed by critics as [...] "a confusing, painfully overwrought melodrama".|$|E

2500|$|Overwatchs {{diversity}} also {{extends to}} other character facets. Blizzard {{has said that}} some of the characters have LGBT identities; Metzen said that the inclusion of LGBT characters was not [...] "to be a data point or feel contrived in any way", but instead to have these identities [...] "play out organically". Tracer was the first identified as one of the LGBT characters via one of the promotional online comics. Blizzard said on this reveal [...] "as with any aspect of our characters' backgrounds, their sexuality is just one part of what makes our heroes who they are.

[...] Blizzard reiterated their goal to have a diverse cast with Tracer's reveal, stating, [...] "from the beginning, we've wanted the universe of Overwatch to feel welcoming and inclusive, and to reflect the diversity of our players around the world."

[...] "Jayne sees that she has the strength to run the show," [...] Asher explained. [...] "Lady Byrne is reluctant at first, but realises that she can do some good and keep the family name going - and <b>she</b> <b>does</b> <b>a</b> rather excellent job of it." [...] Asher was able to contribute to the storyline in the planning stages, due to her real-world experience with Asperger syndrome. [...] "As president of The National Autistic Society, Asperger's is something I've worked with for 25 years. When Holby approached the society about this plot concerning the boy with Asperger's syndrome, they said, 'Do you realise the woman involved in this storyline is our president?'. So I was able to help out." ...|$|E

She knows of every courtship that is going on; every lovelorn damsel is sure to find a patient listener and a sage adviser in her ladyship. She takes great pains to reconcile all love-quarrels, and should any faithless swain persist in his inconstancy, he is sure to draw on himself the good lady's violent indignation.|$|E
