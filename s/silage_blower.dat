50|$|Early {{tractors}} used belts or cables {{wrapped around}} the flywheel or a separate belt pulley to power stationary equipment, such as a threshing machine, buzz saw, <b>silage</b> <b>blower,</b> or stationary baler. In most cases, it was not practical for the tractor and equipment to move with a flexible belt or cable between them, so this system required the tractor to remain in one location, with the work brought to the equipment, or the tractor to be relocated at each turn and the power set-up reapplied (as in cable-drawn plowing systems used in early steam tractor operations).|$|E
50|$|The most simple {{mitigation}} {{strategy would}} be for workers to abstain from entering the storage bin, especially within {{three to four weeks}} following the addition of new silage. In the event that a worker is required to enter the silo, the unit should be ventilated (with a <b>silage</b> <b>blower</b> or ventilation fans) for a minimum of 30 minutes prior to entry, with ventilation fans running for the duration that the worker is in the bin. Additional ventilation time is necessary when the silo diameter is greater than 24 feet or if the silage surface is greater than 15 feet {{from the top of the}} silo.|$|E
