25|$|In August 1984, Tom Gorder {{became the}} {{president}} of Armco's Ashland Works. Trying to stem the loss of 2,000 jobs in 10 years, he stated he would help consolidate Ashland and Middletown, Ohio's steel mills together {{in an effort to}} improve efficiency. That resulted in the closure of the hot strip mill, however, a new slab caster was constructed that provided steel slabs for Middletown. The hot strip mill's closure in 1992, however, eliminated 930 jobs. The <b>Sinter</b> <b>plant,</b> cold strip mill, temper mills, pickling lines, annealing lines and machine shop all closed by 1995.|$|E

40|$|The proper {{performance}} of <b>sinter</b> <b>plants</b> {{is vital for}} efficient and uniformly blast furnace operations. For smooth <b>sinter</b> <b>plants</b> operation, changes to the operating conditions should be few and precise. This paper explains advisory platforms that supply control strategies and sinter quality estimations to the plant operators, developing mathematical model, which are able to advise them about the necessary decisions to improve sinter quality.

50|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, most ores were {{concentrated}} before smelting. Smelting was initially undertaken using <b>sinter</b> <b>plants</b> and blast furnaces, or with roasters and reverberatory furnaces. Roasting and reverberatory furnace smelting dominated primary copper production until the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Many {{smelting}} {{companies were}} seeking new processes to replace <b>sinter</b> <b>plants</b> and blast furnaces. Possibilities included the QSL lead smelting process, the Kivcet process, the Kaldo top-blown rotary converter, and adapting Outokumpu’s successful copper and nickel flash furnace to lead smelting.|$|R
40|$|<b>Sinter</b> <b>plants</b> have {{to process}} mineral mixes {{in order to}} obtain sinter of a {{suitable}} composition and quality to be loaded into the blast furnace. For this purpose a series of parameters need to be taken into account, such as the nature and composition of each component of the mineral mix and the conditions of the manufacturing process. Sinter is subjected to in-depth characterisation in terms of chemical and granulometric analysis, determination of the mineral phases in its structure and of quality indices such as reducibility, low temperature degradation, reduction degradation, and tumbler strength. It is also important to operate <b>sinter</b> <b>plants</b> with high productivity and to ensure a uniform sinter composition and quality so as to facilitate the steady state operation of the blast furnace...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the {{traditional}} blast furnace and <b>sinter</b> <b>plant</b> technology {{that was the}} mainstay of the lead smelting industry was coming under sustained pressure from more stringent environmental requirements, increased energy costs, decreasing metal prices and rising capital and operating costs.|$|E
50|$|The Broken Hill Associated Smelters Proprietary Limited (“BHAS”) lead smelter, {{now owned}} by Nyrstar NV, has been the world’s largest lead smelter.
