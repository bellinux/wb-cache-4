The relevance of these impacts upon commercialization programs is then discussed, covering the role of standards in the new in- dustry's development, the need for <b>standards</b> <b>and</b> warranties in demonstration projects and in the private financing of new energy systems, and mechanisms for development of <b>standards</b> <b>and</b> warranties. The need for basic research on <b>standards</b> <b>and</b> warranties is then addressed. Photovoltaics Projec...|$|R
