5000|$|Job {{rotation}} is {{an approach}} to management development, where an individual is moved through a schedule of assignments designed to give him or her a breadth {{of exposure to the}} entire operation. Job rotation is also practiced to allow qualified employees to gain more insights into the processes of a company and to increase job satisfaction through job variation. The term job rotation can also mean the <b>scheduled</b> <b>exchange</b> of persons in offices, especially in public offices, prior to the end of incumbency or the legislative period. This has been practiced by the German green party for some time but has been discontinued ...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, some of {{economical}} {{and technical}} aspects of expanding the HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) transmission systems in the North Sea are studied at steady state. In the thesis, {{it is assumed that}} the expansion of the system is made by connecting WPPs (Wind Power Plants) to the system which is built for power exchange. From the economical point view, it is observed that the system operator can gain from the expansion of the system. The gain can vary depending upon the total capacity of the WPPs, the transmission tariff paid by the WPP (Wind Power Plant) operators and the cost of altering the <b>scheduled</b> <b>exchange</b> powers due to the added WPPs. It is also observed that, in most of the studied cases, significant economic gains can be achieved by reinforcing the systems when the total WPP capacities are higher than 60 % of the total possible WPP capacities from a control point of view. Furthermore, in order to simulate the power from the WPPs in the system, which is a function of wind speed, a standard ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) based modelling procedure is used. Due to a limitation in the standard modelling procedure to model a time series wind speed data, a modified modelling procedure is proposed which is based on decomposing the data into HF (High Frequency) and LF (Low Frequency) components. In addition, for a 10 minute average wind speed data, a six order AR (Auto Regressive) model structure can be used to model the HF component of the data and a six orderMA(Moving Average) model structure can be used to model the LF component of the data. In order to split the 10 minute average wind speed data into HF and LF components, a cut off period of Tcutoff = 4 day was found to be sufficient. Moreover, proposed model structures and the corresponding model parameters {{that can be used to}} simulate 10 minute average wind speed data in the Baltic Sea areas, where there are no measured wind speed data, are also presented in the thesis. In addition, a control strategy which is based on local primary controllers followed by a central secondary controller is proposed in the thesis. The proposed control strategy can be used to enable the integration of WPPs into a system designed for power exchange...|$|E

In Experiment 1, tokens were earned {{according to a}} fixed-ratio 50 <b>schedule</b> and were <b>exchanged</b> for food according to either fixed-ratio or variable-ratio <b>exchange</b> <b>schedules,</b> with schedule type varied across conditions. In Experiment 2, schedule type was varied within sessions using a multiple schedule.

In the other component, tokens were earned according to a variable-ratio 50 <b>schedule</b> and <b>exchanged</b> according to a fixed-ratio schedule.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a new energy-efficient MAC design {{to improve the}} performance of IEEE 802. 15. 4 -based wireless sensor networks. Our proposed mechanism adaptively determines the sleeping schedules of sensor nodes based on the network traffic load to achieve the balance of throughput and energy consumption. This mechanism consists of two phases: <b>schedule</b> <b>exchange</b> phase and <b>schedule</b> generation phase. In the <b>schedule</b> <b>exchange</b> phase, the <b>schedule</b> parameters are piggybacked in normal transmissions. In the schedule generation phase, sensor nodes adaptively determine the sleeping schedule from the schedule parameters. Eventually, the schedules of all sensor nodes converge to one schedule. The experimental {{results show that the}} proposed mechanism achieves sleeping schedule convergence and high energy efficiency...|$|R

40|$|The {{metabolic}} {{function and}} GM-CSF production rates of adherent human bone marrow stromal cells were investigated as functions of medium and serum feeding rates. A range of medium <b>exchange</b> <b>schedules</b> was studied, {{ranging from a}} typical Dexter culture protocol of one weekly medium exchange to a full media exchange daily, which more closely approximates what bone marrow cells experience in situ. Glucose consumption {{was found to be}} significantly higher at full daily exchange rate than at any other <b>exchange</b> <b>schedule</b> examined. However, the lactate yield on glucose was a constant, at 1. 8 mol/mol, under all conditions considered. Differential serum vs. medium exchange experiment showed that both serum supply and medium nutrients were responsible for the altered behavior at high exchange rates. Glutamine consumption was found to be insignificant under all culture conditions examined. A change in <b>exchange</b> <b>schedule</b> from 50 % daily medium exchange to full daily medium exchange after 14 days of culture was found to result in a transient production of GM-CSF and a change in metabolic behavior to resemble that of cultures which had full daily exchange from day one.

40|$|Neighbor Discovery (ND) is {{the process}} that initializes a {{reliable}} communication between one-hop neighbors in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). This process consists of <b>scheduled</b> <b>exchanges</b> of control messages, called “Hello Messages” (HMs) between one-hop neighbors. HMs build bidirectional links {{that are used to}} announce the topology information. Each node uses ND and the topology information to populate its routing tables and to communicate with every other node in the network. In MANETs, ND process is a permanent process to discover one-hop neighbors. It is based on two parameters: 1) ND message interval (the period of time in between sending hello messages); and 2) ND message hold time (the validity time). A reliable ND process sustains a reliable data communication. Therefore, this research studies the impact of the ND parameters in data transmission by measuring the overall packet loss. ...|$|R

Methods: This is a descriptive and quantitative study. The activities were developed in a university hospital located in the interior of Rio Grande do Sul in the period April to July 2016, by pharmaceutical resident professionals.
