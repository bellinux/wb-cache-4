25|$|The Wii U GamePad was {{described}} as a <b>survival</b> <b>kit</b> for players. It was inspired by the studio's previous game, Peter Jackson's King Kong, in which players make use of the environment to survive (such as using a torch to scare off enemies); the team made the GamePad a <b>survival</b> <b>kit,</b> taking considerable time to fine-tune the GamePad's functions. Although it was initially possible for players to plan strategy with the GamePad, they rarely did so. The team then retooled the system to include features such as the mini-map, resulting in players focusing on the GamePad and ignoring the action on the TV. Eventually, the team balanced player time on both screens by switching from first- to third-person perspective when the player uses the <b>survival</b> <b>kit.</b> Players are vulnerable when using the kit, prompting them to look at the TV screen while using the GamePad. This increases the game's tension, making it more scary to play. According to Guillaume, the team realized this potential when they implemented the lock-pick feature (when players must be aware of their surroundings while trying to unlock a door). To further immerse players in the game, the voice of the Prepper is channeled through the GamePad's speakers and players need to read text with the pad; since the GamePad is a real-world object, the experience is more intimate. The pad displayed most crucial information to the player, and the game did not have a user interface.|$|E
25|$|On 25 July 1957, {{the airline}} {{introduced}} its flight simulator for the Douglas DC-7C – the last KLM aircraft with piston engines – which opened the transpolar route from Amsterdam via Anchorage to Tokyo on 1 November 1958.

25|$|Leendert Hasenbosch was a Dutch ship's officer (a bookkeeper), {{probably}} born in 1695. He was set ashore on the uninhabited Ascension Island on 5 May 1725 as {{a punishment}} for sodomy. He {{was left behind}} with a tent, a <b>survival</b> <b>kit,</b> and an amount of water sufficient to last about four weeks. He had bad luck in that no ships called at the island during his stay. He ate seabirds and green turtles, but probably died of thirst after about six months. He wrote a diary that was found in January 1726 by British mariners who brought the diary back to Britain. The diary was rewritten and published a number of times.|$|E

25|$|The Hawker Hardy was a {{general-purpose}} {{variant of}} the Hawker Hart tropicalised to meet Air Ministry Specification G.23/33 as a Wapiti replacement in Iraq. The prototype was a production Hart which was modified with a modified radiator, a message pick-up hook, water containers and a desert <b>survival</b> <b>kit.</b> The prototype first flew on 7 September 1934, and the first production aircraft were delivered to 30 Squadron in January 1935. The Hardy saw some service during the Second World War, in Africa and the Middle East; the Hardys performing a number of operations against Italian-occupied Abyssinia {{as well as other}} areas of Africa. The Hardy also saw service with Southern Rhodesia. The last operational sortie by a Hardy was on 9 May 1941 and most of the survivors were scrapped, although some continued in service as communications aircraft. On 14 May 1941, the Belgian Colonial authorities obtained a Hawker Hardy from the South African Air Force. Painted in Belgian colours, the machine was used for observation missions, but unfortunately overturned while landing at Gambela airfield on 26 May 1941, effectively writing off the aircraft.|$|E

500|$|Hagerstrom, {{determined}} to be an ace in two wars, studied MiG-15 reports, got a silk coat and special glasses {{that allowed him to}} see twice as far as normal, and made his own <b>survival</b> <b>kit.</b> He later transferred to the 334th Fighter Squadron of the Fifth U.S. Air Force's 18th Wing, some members of which (including Hagerstrom) were equipped with North American F-86 Sabres. Hagerstrom got the wing's first kill of the war on November 21, 1952 near the Yalu River. The MiG pilot Hagerstrom was shooting at ejected just before his plane exploded, and a piece of that plane was embedded in Hagerstrom's F-86, proving the kill to Kimpo Air Base group commander Royal N. Baker. On December25, he got his second kill when the MiG he was chasing at an altitude of [...] spun out of control, and the pilot ejected, most likely dying of exposure to the [...] temperatures. In January1953 Hagerstrom was transferred to Osan Air Base to help with the transition from propeller P-38s to jet F-86s, and by mid-February the wing's 125 pilots were trained in the F-86. On February25 he was chasing two MiGs when he noticed a third attacking another F-86; he engaged and shot it down flying very low over Mukden, China. Low on fuel, he had just enough fuel to land and park the aircraft.|$|E
