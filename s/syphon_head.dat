40|$|D. s. MILLER, 2 The data on {{vertical}} downward flow have a {{much wider}} interest than the authors concern with nuclear reactors. For instance, heat exchanger and condenser cooling water outlet pipes on large petro-chemical plants often dis-charge vertically. If, as has happened, the outlet pipe discharges into a free flowing culvert the pipe may fail to prime, resulting in loss of <b>syphon</b> <b>head</b> and vibration of the pipe and heat ex-changer. In civil engineering the problems of priming large syphons are well known. In cases {{where there is no}} water seal at outlet de-vices are used to deflect the flow to form a seal, causing the syphon to prime without the need for an excessively large supply head. In horizontal flow a pipe runs full if the critical depth exceeds the pipe diameter and, if the normal depth of flow is less than th...|$|E
