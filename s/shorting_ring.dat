5000|$|Measured in millihenries (mH), {{this is the}} {{inductance}} of {{the voice}} coil. The coil is a lossy inductor, {{in part due to}} losses in the pole piece, so the apparent inductance changes with frequency. Large Le values limit the high frequency output of the driver and cause response changes near cutoff. Simple modeling software often neglects Le, and so does not include its consequences. Inductance varies with excursion because the voice coil moves relative to the polepiece, which acts as a sliding inductor core, increasing inductance on the inward stroke and decreasing it on the outward stroke in typical overhung coil arrangements. This inductance modulation is an important source of nonlinearity (distortion) in loudspeakers. Including a copper cap on the pole piece, or a copper <b>shorting</b> <b>ring</b> on it, can reduce the increase in impedance seen at higher frequencies in typical drivers, and also reduce the nonlinearity due to inductance modulation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Two new compact planar triple-mode {{resonators}} embed-ded with inductive or capacitive {{cross coupling}} are proposed for band-pass filter design. Both resonators {{consist of a}} <b>shorted</b> half-wave <b>ring.</b> In the first resonator, two shorted half-wave sections with inductive coupling {{are connected to the}} shorted via of the ring. In the second, two quarter-wave sections with capacitive coupling are connected. The inductive coupling is realized by a short grounded high-impedance seg-ment, and the capacitive coupling is implemented by an interdigital ca-pacitor. When both the inductive and capacitive coupling coefficients are properly realized, a transmission zero can be created at designated position in either upper or lower stopband. The <b>shorted</b> <b>ring</b> is accom-modated inside the area of the other two resonance sections so that a compact area can be achieved. As compared with a conventional dual-mode ring resonator filter, the proposed resonators use only 46. 7 % and 22. 5 % in area. Two triple-mode resonator bandpass filters are fabri-cated and measured to validate the ideas. Measurement results have good agreement with the simulation responses. 1...|$|R

Motivated by recent applications of pH-sensitive hydrogels as actuators in adaptive lenses, here we analyze creases induced by constrained swelling. A ring of a gel, bonded between two rigid plates, swells by absorbing a solution from its external wall. The amount of swelling is adaptive in response to the change of the pH of the external solution. We analyze the large and inhomogeneous deformation in the gel by using a previously developed nonlinear field theory and finite element method.
