A preliminary discussion of the role of dissipation is included. The theoretical behaviour of the system with pulleys is illustrated numerically, and the relevance of different parameters is highlighted. Finally, the integrability of the dynamic system is studied, the main result being that the Machine with pulleys is non-integrable.

40|$|International audienceServices are {{successful}} for applications {{with high levels}} of dynamicity and interoperability. Ironically the actual Service-Oriented Computing (SOC) technologies are such that interoperability is problematic if different platforms are used simultaneously, and dedicated tools for the support of most engineering tasks are essentially missing. We address the interoperability issue through the definition of a Service Abstract <b>Machine</b> (<b>SAM)</b> that observes a set of heterogeneous service platforms running on different machines and dynamically builds a reliable and homogeneous model of the global state. Conversely, changes in the state model, through SAM API are dynamically translated into the corresponding action(s) in the actual underlying SOC platforms. Evolution, extensibility and engineering support are addressed by dedicated software engineering environments that fully rely on the state model, as if SAM were a real SOC platform. The paper discusses the challenges we faced and the limits of our approach. We show how the system has been implemented, and we draw the early lessons of SAM second year of use...|$|R

40|$|Movement {{diagrams}} {{are used}} by physiotherapists to depict the behaviour of resistance through the available range of accessory and physiological joint movement. It is generally accepted that for an asymptomatic joint, the resistance first felt by the therapist (R 1) occurs {{towards the end of}} range. R 1 is considered to be at the transition point between the toe and linear region of a load displacement curve. The aim {{of this study was to}} more accurately define R 1 from force displacement curves of accessory movement to the spine and peripheral joints using a validated instrument, the Spinal Assessment <b>Machine</b> (<b>SAM).</b> Thirty archived force displacement curves obtained using the SAM, which applied a posteroanterior force of 100 N at a frequency of 0. 5 Hz to L 3 spinous process, were examined. In addition force displacement curves were similarly obtained from the tibiofemoral joint, glenohumeral joint and radiocarpal joint of one asymptomatic individual. In all cases resistance to a PA movement commenced at the beginning of range, the curve ascending as soon as the force was applied. While in most cases there was a low stiffness ‘toe’ region there was no unambiguous point where it could be said that the toe region ended. It is concluded that for spinal and peripheral accessory movements both the onset of resistance and the toe occurs at the beginning of range. Therapists should therefore depict R 1 at the beginning of range not toward the end of range as is current practice...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{describes the}} process of manufacturing and machining of wire and arc additive manufactured (WAAM) thin wall structures on integrated and non¬integrated WAAM systems. The overall aim of this thesis is to obtain {{a better understanding of}} deposition and machining of WAAM wall parts through an integrated system. This research includes the study of the comparison of deposition of WAAM wall structures on different WAAM platforms, namely an Integrated <b>SAM</b> Edgetek grinding <b>machine,</b> an ABB robot and a Friction Stir Welding (FSW) machine. The result shows that WAAM is a robustly transferable technique that can be implemented across a variety of different platforms typically available in industry. For WAAM deposition, a rise in output repeatedly involves high welding travel speed that usually leads to an undesired humping effect. As part of the objectives of this thesis was to study the travel speed limit for humping. The findings from this research show that the travel speed limit falls within a certain region at which humping starts to occur. One of the objectives of this thesis was to study the effect of lubricants during sequential and non-sequential machining/deposition of the WAAM parts. Conventional fluid lubricants and solid lubricants were used. In addition, the effect of cleaning of deposited wall samples with acetone was also studied. A systematic study shows that a significant amount of solid lubricant contamination {{can be found in the}} deposited material. Furthermore, the results indicate that even cleaning of the wire and arc additive manufactured surfaces with acetone prior to the weld deposition can affect the microstructure of the deposited material...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{evolution}} of the mitochondrion has involved the remodelling of the two membranes that enclose this organelle. During {{the transformation of the}} endosymbiotic bacterium into a genetically dependent organelle, the flow of proteins across the membranes reversed. This change is reflected by the distinct sets of protein transport machinery that operate in bacterial and mitochondrial membranes [1]. One of the exceptions is a β-barrel assembly <b>machine,</b> <b>Sam</b> 50, a member of the Omp 85 superfamily of proteins, which has been retained in the mitochondrial membranes. Other core components of mitochondrial translocases, such as Tom 40 in the outer membrane and the Tim 17 family of proteins in the inner membrane, cannot be directly related to any bacterial proteins. Two studies by Pusnik et al. recently showed that the mitochondrion of Trypanosoma brucei was found to be devoid of the essential Tom 40 channel [2]; instead, it was found to contain an essential protein called the archaic translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (ATOM) that was directly linked to bacterial YtfM proteins, which are members of the Omp 85 superfamily [3]. Thus, it was suggested by Pusnik et al. that ATOM and Tom 40 represent mutually exclusive functional analogues of distinct origins [3]. We analysed the ATOM amino acid sequences to identify homology to known protein families and to determine the phylogenetic distribution of the closest relatives of ATOM. Surprisingly, our results clearly refute the link between ATOM and bacterial Omp 85 -like proteins. Moreover, we propose that ATOM is, in fact, a divergent form of the ‘classical’ Tom 40...|$|R

This makes land surface parameters {{as an important}} tool to study earth’s climate system especially when satellite data provide timely and efficient information about large land area. In the present paper, the study {{was carried out by}} using NASA’s hyper spectral EO- 1 Hyperion sensor and multi-spectral Advance Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) of IRS-P 6 for different ranges (lower, middle and upper) of Himalaya. The analysis procedure consists of Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hyper cubes (FLAASH) atmospheric correction code derives its physics-based algorithm from the Moderate Resolution Transmittance (MODTRAN 4) radiative transfer code as well as radiometric (atmospheric + topographic) correction to retrieve surface reflectance. The terrain characteristics have been extracted from Digital Elevation Model (DEM) using 1 : 50, 000 scale SoI maps at 40 m contour interval. Various statistical models for supervised classification such as spectral angle mapper (<b>SAM),</b> support vector <b>machine</b> (SVM), and maximum likelihood (MLH) has been examined and validated with existed Normalized Difference; Vegetation Index (NDVI), Snow Index (NDSI) and Glacier Index (NDGI) models.

40|$|Efficient and {{sustainable}} coastal management requires regular and accurate monitoring of ecosystem health indicators. In this context, {{the observation of}} short- and long-term changes in species distribution is a main objective of algal monitoring in the intertidal zone of coastal areas. Quantitative analysis of intertidal algal communities provides direct information on their spatial extent and status and indirect information on environmental parameters such as nutrient load or physical disturbance. However, conventional field mapping is time consuming and is limited to relatively small and accessible coastal areas whereas progress in hyperspectral techniques has significantly increased the ability to study spatial and temporal patterns of coastal vegetation. Accordingly, hyperspectral remote sensing {{is one of the}} most promising technologies for mapping coastal habitats. The objective of this study was to analyze the ability of hyperspectral remote sensing to identify macrophytic species and their association on the intertidal flat of Helgoland. On 9 th May 2008, airborne data were acquired using the AISA Eagle Imaging Spectrometer, which operates in the visible and near infrared spectral domain (420 - 970 nm) with a spectral bandwidth of 3 nm. The airborne data acquisition was conducted during low tide with a ground sampling distance of 0. 80 metres. Extensive field mapping provided information to validate the remote sensing data. The AISA data were pre-processed radiometrically before an atmospheric and geometric correction was conducted. Water, land and shadowed areas were masked off to isolate the intertidal zone. Then, different classification techniques were applied and tested for their potential to identify algae species and their associations, i. e. Spectral Angle Mapper (<b>SAM),</b> Support Vector <b>Machine</b> (SVM) and Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC). The SVM approach resulted in an overall accuracy of 76...|$|R
