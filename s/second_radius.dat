50|$|The {{growth and}} decay of {{wavelengths}} {{can be determined}} by examining the change in pressure a perturbation wavelength imposes on {{the interior of the}} fluid thread. Changes to the internal pressure of the thread are induced by capillary pressure as the free surface of the thread deforms. Capillary pressure {{is a function of the}} mean curvature of the interface at a given location at the surface, meaning the pressure is dependent on the two radii of curvature that give the shape of the surface. Within the thinned area of a fluid thread undergoing breakup, the first radius of curvature is smaller than the radius of curvature in the thickened area, leading to a pressure gradient that would tend to force liquid from the thinned to thickened areas. However, the <b>second</b> <b>radius</b> of curvature remains important to the breakup process. For some perturbation wavelengths, the effect of the <b>second</b> <b>radius</b> of curvature can overcome the pressure effect of the first radius of curvature, inducing a larger pressure in the thickened regions than the thinned regions. This would push fluid back toward the thinned regions and tend to return the thread to its original, undisturbed shape. However, for other perturbation wavelengths, the capillary pressure induced by the <b>second</b> <b>radius</b> of curvature will reinforce that of the first radius of curvature. This will drive fluid from the thinned to the thickened regions and further promote thread breakup.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} is to {{demonstrate}} that separation of solvated ions in solution of mixed salts under the action of external periodic electric field is caused by the formation of clusters consisting of solvent molecules and surrounding the ions. Such clusters have the dimensions of about 0. 1 µm. The study includes the theoretical estimation of cluster dimensions and experimental determination of the external electric field frequency that gives rise to the separation of solvated ions. The results testify that placing the volume distributed electric charge of ion into dielectric liquid is accompanied by the formation of supramolecular particles. We called such particles “clusters”. The linear dimensions of clusters significantly exceed the first and the <b>second</b> <b>radii</b> of solvation (approximately 1 Angstrom) and amount to nearly 0. 1 µm.

Hinsdale Wave Research Laboratory large scale wave flume at Oregon State Uni-versity in 2005. Flow field and seabed geometry {{data was collected}} using a submersible Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system. Sea bed geometry measurements include: ripple height (η), wavelength (λ), and radius of curvature (RC). The seabed {{is determined by the}} centroid of the maximum light reflection captured by a submerged camera when the bed is illuminated by a laser sheet in the PIV system. Observations were obtained under random wave conditions using a TMA spectrum with significant wave heights ranging from 30 to 50 cm and wave periods in the range of 4 to 8 seconds. The resulting bed geometries ranged from flat to rippled. Over temporal scales as short as one wave period, significant trans-formations in geometry were recorded.

Figure 7 d {{shows that the}} Chan and Vese method provides {{the inner and outer}} frontiers of the blurred contours, but also unexpected pixels due to the convergence onto noise pixels. On the contrary, the proposed method provides only the expected contours. The computational loads required by the proposed methods and comparative Chan and Vese method are as follows: center estimation requires 4.25 × 10 - 2 s. Then for each circle, TLS-ESPRIT method requires 8.8 × 10 - 3 s to estimate the radius. To estimate the spread parameter σ, Newton algorithm requires 4.8 × 10 - 3 s. In this case, the ALS loop is not run because there is only one circle for each center, and so one spread value to retrieve for each center. The total running time for the proposed method is then 8.3 × 10 - 2 s. For the image as a whole, the Chan and Vese method requires 2.64 s, so 31 times more than the proposed method.|$|E

We focus {{on the effect of}} an expanding universe on massive objects on the scale of galaxies and clusters. Using Newtonian and general-relativistic approaches, we identify two important time-dependent physical radii for such objects when the cosmological expansion is accelerating. The first radius, r_F, is that at which the total radial force on a test particle is zero, which is also the radius of the largest possible circular orbit about the central mass m and where the gas pressure and its gradient vanish. The <b>second</b> <b>radius,</b> r_S, which is ≈ r_F/ 1. 6, is that of the largest possible stable circular orbit, which we interpret as the theoretical maximum size for an object of mass m. In contrast, for a decelerating cosmological expansion, no such finite radii exist. Assuming a cosmological expansion consistent with a ΛCDM concordance model, at the present epoch we find that these radii put a sensible constraint on the typical sizes of both galaxies and clusters at low redshift. For galaxies, we also find that these radii agree closely with zeroes in the radial velocity field in the neighbourhood of nearby galaxies, as inferred by Peirani & Pacheco from recent observations of stellar velocities. We then consider the future effect on massive objects of an accelerating cosmological expansion driven by phantom energy, for which the universe is predicted to end in a `Big Rip' at a finite time in the future at which the scale factor becomes singular. In particular, we present a novel calculation of the time prior to the Big Rip that an object of a given mass and size will become gravitationally unbound.

40|$|A new {{algorithm}} is presented for the lattice simulation of protein crystal growth. The algorithm allows {{the calculation of}} the size distribution of microcrystals in the volume and timescale of experiments and {{within the framework of}} the previously-published microscopic model �A. M. Kierzek, W. M. Wolf, P. Zielenkiewicz, Biophys. J. 73 Ž 1997. 571 � 580 �. Simulations for the tetragonal lysozyme crystal show that there are two critical sizes in the development of ordered phase. The first one corresponds to the size of the smallest stable complex which, in the case of the tetragonal lysozyme crystal, is the particular tetramer. In a volume of 5 �l the tetramer appears in the millisecond timescale. The <b>second</b> critical <b>radius</b> of approximately 100 monomers is only reached by a few of all the smallest stable complexes formed in the solution. The model predicts that out of 107 tetramers which appear in solution, only eight reach the size of 100 monomers within 8 h. After exceeding the <b>second</b> critical <b>radius</b> the microcrystals grow to the size of 104 monomers in the minute timescale and are thus assumed to quickly lead to macroscopic crystals.

We present multifrequency very large array (VLA) radio continuum observations of Cep A HW 2, the elongated radio object believed to be associated with te most luminous (approximately 104 solar luminosity) source in the region. In the frequency range from 1. 5 to 43 GHz, we find that its flux density increases with frequency as nu 0. 69, while the angular size of its major axis decreases with frequency as nu- 0. 57. The above frequency dependences are very close to the theoretical values of nu 0. 6 and nu- 0. 7 expected for a biconical thermal jet and make Cep A HW 2 the best example known of this type of object.

40|$|The aim {{of study}} is to {{demonstrate}} that separation of solvated ions in solution of mix of salts under the action of external periodic electric field happens because of around ions there are formed clusters consisting of molecules of solvent and the sizes of such clusters have dimensions ~ 0. 1 [mu]m. In investigations the sizes of clusters theoretically were defined and experimentally value of frequency of external electric field which action excites the effect of separation of the solvated ions was defined. Experiments were done in the Technical Physics Chair of the National Research Tomsk Polytechnic University. At theoretical determination of the dimensions of clusters Poisson's equation was solved and was considered that polar molecules of solvent are oriented under the action of electric field of an ion. The chemical composition of samples of solutions was determined {{by means of the}} spectrophotometry and he X-ray excited fluorescent radiation analysis method.

Objective Using Fourier transform infrared analysis (FTIR) in vitro, the effects of varying radiant exposure (RE) values generated by second and third generation LED LCUs on the degree of conversion (DC) and maximum rate of polymerization (Rpmax) of an experimental Lucirin TPO-based RC were evaluated. Material and Methods 1 mm or 2 mm thick silicon molds were positioned on a horizontal attenuated total reflectance (ATR) unit attached to an infrared spectroscope. The RC was inserted into the molds and exposed to varying REs (18, 36 and 56 J/cm 2) using <b>second</b> (<b>Radii</b> Plus, SDI) and third generation LED LCUs (Bluephase G 2 /Ivoclar Vivadent) or a quartz tungsten based LCU (Optilux 501 /SDS Kerr). FTIR spectra (n= 7) were recorded for 10 min (1 spectrum/s, 16 scans/spectrum, resolution 4 cm- 1) immediately after their application to the ATR. The DC was calculated using standard techniques for observing changes in aliphatic to aromatic peak ratios both prior to, and 10 min after curing, as well as during each 1 second interval. DC and Rpmax data were analyzed using 3 -way ANOVA and Tukey’s post-hoc test (p= 0. 05). Results No significant difference in DC or Rpmax was observed between the 1 mm or 2 mm thick specimens when RE values were delivered by Optilux 501 or when the 1 mm thick composites were exposed to light emitted by Bluephase G 2, which in turn promoted a lower DC when 18 J/cm 2 (13 s) were delivered to the 2 mm thick specimens. Radii Plus promoted DC and Rpmax values close to zero under most conditions, while the delivery of 56 J/cm 2 (40 s) resulted in low DC values.
