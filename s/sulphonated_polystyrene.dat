50|$|This effect {{comes as}} a result of two {{similarly}} charged particles, one from the resin and one from the solution, failing to distribute properly between the two sides; there is a selective uptake of one ion over another. For example, in a <b>sulphonated</b> <b>polystyrene</b> resin, a cation exchange resin, the chlorine ion of a hydrochloric acid buffer should equilibrate into the resin. However, since the concentration of the sulphonic acid in the resin is high, the hydrogen of HCl has no tendency to enter the column. This, combined with the need of electroneutrality, leads to a minimum amount of hydrogen and chlorine entering the resin.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{establish}} the staining characteristics of certain {{ion exchange resins}} in histological material, {{with a view to}} enabling confident differential identification. METHODS: Various histological staining procedures were applied to selected pathological material and prepared agar blocks containing the cation exchange resin calcium <b>polystyrene</b> <b>sulphonate</b> and the anion exchange resin cholestyramine. RESULTS: Calcium <b>polystyrene</b> <b>sulphonate</b> uniquely stained strongly by a direct Schiff's reagent procedure without any preoxidation and by the Ziehl-Neelsen method. Cholestyramine was negative by the former method but stained strongly with a standard Congo red technique. CONCLUSIONS: These staining results are consistent with the known structure and properties of <b>polystyrene</b> <b>sulphonate</b> and cholestyramine resins. <b>Polystyrene</b> <b>sulphonate</b> resins have the virtually pathognomonic feature of direct Schiff positivity, while morphology, location, and strong non-birefringent Congo red positivity facilitate the identification of cholestyramine. It is possible that the intrinsic staining characteristics of cholestyramine may be lost once it has bound to its target...|$|R

40|$|Peritoneal macrophages were plated out on {{a series}} of {{artificial}} haptotactic substrata con-sisting of grid patterns of vacuum-evaporated palladium metal alternating with hydrophobic untreated polystyrene and with hydrophilic <b>sulphonated</b> <b>polystyrene.</b> By their active locomo-tion the macrophages accumulated preferentially onto the less hydrophilic of either pair of these alternative substrata. This order of substratum preference is precisely the opposite to that shown by fibroblastic cells. Macrophages were also found to accumulate preferentially onto roughened culture surfaces as opposed to smooth ones, which is again opposite to the behaviour of fibroblasts. These opposite substratum preferences shown by macrophages may reflect physical as well as functional differences in their surfaces, and could serve as assay criteria for macrophages and cell types putatively equivalent to macrophages...|$|E

The effect of sulphonation on photophysical, photooxidative and photocytotoxic properties of sensitizer 5, 10, 15, 20 -meso- tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) encapsulated in polystyrene nanofibres has been studied as well. Properties of TPP have been examined with time-resolved spectroscopy, photooxidation of uric acid as substrate and bactericidal tests on Escherichia coli DH 5 α with pGEM 11 Z plasmid.

40|$|Anionic {{polymerisation}} {{techniques have}} been optimised {{to develop a}} “one-pot”, facile method to produce both linear and branched polystyrenes utilising the “Strathclyde” route to highly branched structures. ATRP was investigated as a possible method but anionic polymerisation was found to give much better control over the size and structure of polystyrenes produced. Using this anionic polymerisation relatively monodisperse linear polystyrenes were synthesised with dispersity values as low as 1. 03 for a polystyrene chain with a targeted degree of polymerisation (DPn) of 100 monomer units. A number of different structures of branched polystyrene were synthesised, and their different physical properties examined by viscometry measurements and differential calorimetry scanning experiments. It {{has been found that}} very dense, highly branched materials (with approximations of 48 polymer chains branched together) can be synthesised with a targeted primary chain DPn = 10 monomer units. Weight average molecular weight (Mw) values as high as 992, 000 gmol- 1 for branched polystyrene can be synthesised with a primary chain length of DPn = 50 monomer units. Functional polystyrenes were synthesised both by initiation with an amine containing compound and sec-BuLi, resulting in chain end functionalisation, and also post-functionalised by sulphonation of synthesised polystyrenes, resulting in a statistical distribution along the polymer chains pendant groups. The hydrophilicity could be manipulated by the percentage of sulphonation. At over 30 % sulphonation of the pendant polystyrene groups, the polymers become water soluble. Polymer nanoparticles have been synthesised by a nanoprecipitation method from functionalised branched polystyrene synthesised by anionic polymerisation techniques. Nanoparticles synthesised from DPn 10 branched <b>sulphonated</b> <b>polystyrenes</b> were analysed by dynamic light scattering and found to be approximately 60 nm with dispersity values as low as 0. 15.

The soil conditioner used was a post cross-linked <b>sulphonated</b> <b>polystyrene.</b> The soil used was a sand with sunflowers (Helianthus annuus) grown for 10 wk. The plant parameters examined were emergence time, growth, wilting time and aboveground biomass. Soil parameters included field capacity, wilting point and available water. These parameters were correlated with the polymer content in the soil and the degree of water equilibrium swelling of the polymers. The tests were performed in pots under water deficiency conditions. Second-order factorial designs were applied and the resultant mathematical models proved adequate and reasonable.

40|$|The {{specificity}} of endothelial binding sites for heparin was investigated with heparin fractions and fragments differing in their Mr, charge density and affinity for antithrombin III, {{as well as}} with heparinoids and other anionic polyelectrolytes (<b>polystyrene</b> <b>sulphonates).</b> The affinity for endothelial cells was estimated by determining I 50 values in competition experiments with 125 I-heparin. We found that affinity for endothelial cells increases as a function of Mr and charge density (degree of sulphation). Binding sites are not specific receptors for heparin. Other anionic polyelectrolytes, such as pentosan polysulphates and <b>polystyrene</b> <b>sulphonates,</b> competed with heparin for binding to endothelial cells. Fractions of standard heparin with high affinity for antithrombin III also had greater affinity for endothelium. However, these two properties of heparin (affinity for antithrombin III and affinity for endothelial cells) could be dissociated. Oversulphated heparins and oversulphated low-Mr heparin fragments had lower anticoagulant activity and higher affinity for endothelial cells than did their parent compounds. Synthetic pentasaccharides, bearing the minimal sequence for binding to antithrombin III, did not bind to endothelial cells. Binding to endothelial cells involved partial neutralization of heparin. Bound heparin exhibited only 5 % and 7 % of antifactor IIa and antifactor Xa specific activity, respectively. In the presence of 200 nM-antithrombin III, {{and in the absence of}} free heparin, a limited fraction (approx. 30 %) of bound heparin was displaced from endothelial cells during a 1 h incubation period. These data suggested that a fraction of surface-bound heparin could represent a pool of anticoagulant...|$|R

CaOx exhibits three crystalline types in nature: CaOx monohydrate COM, dihydrate COD and trihydrate COT. COD and COM are {{often found in}} urinary calculi, particularly COM. Langmuir monolayers, membrane vesicles, phospholipids’ micelles, among others, have been adopted as simplified biomimetic template-models to study in vitro the urolithiasis through CaOx.

The method developed involved the preparation of a thin <b>sulphonated</b> <b>polystyrene</b> layer supported on a thin VYNS film on which cations were deposited by ion-exchange. The p-counting efficiency of the sources in a 4 II β-proportional counter was determined by coincidence counting. Autoradiography was used to determine the uniformity of the sources. Evaporated gold on the VYNS film support was found to promote the surface diffusion of mercury and investigations led to a procedure applicable to the measurement of the counting efficiency of p-emitting mercury isotopes; a method for the calibration of a proportional counter used in the determination of the Tl(^ 203) (n,pHg(^ 203) cross-section was thereby evolved.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{isolation}} and purification of pyridinoline from bone collagen was developed, {{with the use}} of <b>sulphonated</b> <b>polystyrene</b> resins. The analytical techniques were used to quantify pyridinoline, for which hydroxyallysine is a known precursor, {{in a wide range of}} tissues. The structure of pyridinoline proposed by Fujimoto, Moriguchi, Ishida & Hayashi [(1978) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 84, 52 - 57] was confirmed by 13 C-n. m. r. spectroscopy and fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry. At concentrations greater than about 0. 1 mM, pyridinoline exhibited altered fluorescence properties that were consistent with excimer formation. From alkali hydrolysates of several different tissues, a fluorescent compound was purified by gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography and was shown to be galactosylpyridinoline. This derivative was very labile to acid treatment compared with the bifunctional cross-link analogues, and was completely converted into free pyridinoline by heating at 108 degrees C for 8 h in 0. 1 M-HCl. Galactosylpyridinoline was also partially converted into free pyridinoline by prolonged alkali hydrolysis. This lability, which could also apply to other multifunctional cross-link derivatives, may explain the fact that no disaccharide derivatives of pyridinoline were isolated...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of phase separated micellar solutions of randomly <b>sulphonated</b> <b>polystyrene</b> ionomers in toluene were examined with neutron spin echo spectroscopy (NSE). The correlation functions demonstrated single exponential decays with a constant background offset. The relaxation rate (Gamma) of the ionomer micelles at small length scales in the q range 0. 075 - 0. 16 angstrom(- 1) was diffusive (Gamma similar to q(2)) as expected for the collective breathing mode of a cross-linked gel. At intermediate length scales in the q-range 0. 025 - 0. 075 the relaxation rates were non-diffusive (Gamma similar to q(0. 36),q(0. 72)), which {{is attributed to}} the hopping {{dynamics of}} the individual stickers inside the ionomer micelles (T-stick similar to 10 ns). At large length scales the scattering due to the phase separated inhomogeneities of the micellar network did not relax on the time scales of the measurements (< 20 ns), giving rise to a constant background on the correlation functions. This slow relaxation process {{may be due to}} the hopping dynamics of whole micelles previously observed in rheology experiments (T (micelle) similar to 0. 05 s). The NSE results are in agreement with a model developed in previous small-angle neutron scattering and rheology experiments for concentrated solution of ionomeric micelles. The NSE results for the associating ionomers are markedly different from the Zimm dynamics (Gamma similar to q(3)) previously observed for semi-dilute and cross-linked polystyrene polymers in a good solvent. The ionomeric cross-links thus have a large impact on the polymer chain dynamics at the nanosecond time scale. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{asymmetric}} hydrogenation of prochiral enamides with Rh complexes bearing chiral phosphine–phosphite ligands (P–OP) {{supported on}} <b>sulphonated</b> <b>polystyrene</b> resins has been studied. The complexes have {{been supported by}} simple treatment of preformed [Rh(diolefin) (P–OP) ](BF 4) with the Li salt of resins. In MeOH, high enantioselectivities were observed in the hydrogenation of methyl α-N-acetamido acrylate (4 a), while they decreased for less reactive methyl α-N-acetamido cinnamate (4 b). Moreover, a significant Rh leaching was observed in these reactions. In contrast, a low Rh leaching was observed in reactions performed in water. Catalyst optimization enabled by the highly modular structure of P–OP ligands led to efficient catalysts for the hydrogenation of 4 a and 4 b in water, with enantioselectivities over 95 % ee and S/C values up to 2300 and 500, respectively. To investigate the synthetic potential of the present catalytic system, the hydrogenation {{of a set of}} β-aryl α-dehydroaminoacids (4 c– 4 j) in water has also been studied. For these reactions good catalytic activity and high enantioselectivity (87 – 97 % ee) were also observed. In the case of brominated substrates 4 i and 4 j an unexpected debromination reaction in water has been observed. This phenomenon seems {{associated with the use of}} the supported catalyst and water and could be minimized by the use of a catalyst formed from 3 f.

After 45 min only, almost completion of azide crosslinking could be achieved, resulting in crosslinked membranes with insoluble fractions higher than 95 %. The sulphonation of the crosslinked membranes afforded ionic exchange capacities (IECs) ranging from 2. 2 to 3. 2 meq g- 1. The hydration number was shown to be very high (from 30 to 75), depending on both the content of perfluorodecane and of sulphonic acid groups. The morphology of the membranes, assessed by small-angle X-ray scattering, was found to be a lamellar-type structure with two types of ionic domains.

In this research, Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) was synthesized by sulphonation of polystyrene butadiene rubber that is readily available in South Africa, using chlorosulphonic acid as the sulphonating agent. The synthesized membrane was blended with carbon nanoballs (CNBs) produced by the swirled floating catalytic chemical fluid deposition (SFCCVD) method designed and conceptualized by Iyuke (2005). Synthesis of carbon nanoparticles with this reactor was optimized using different experimental conditions of pyrolysis temperature, flow rates of acetylene, hydrogen and argon gases. A maximum production rate of 0. 35 g/min was obtained at 1000 oC, acetylene flow rate of 370 ml/min, hydrogen flow rate of 180 ml/min and a flow ratio of acetylene to hydrogen equal to five. Since clean nanoparticles are required in this work for membrane synthesis, the SFCCVD reactor was modified to synthesize clean carbon nanoballs via a non-catalytic method. The carbon nanoballs produced were used in the formulation of <b>sulphonated</b> <b>polystyrene</b> butadiene rubber–carbon nanoballs composite membrane. The synthesised membranes and the composite membranes were characterized to determine the ion exchange capacity, degree of sulphonation, thermal stability, water uptake, vi porosity, proton conductivity, solvent uptake, and morphology and methanol crossover. The characterization of the synthesized membrane for methanol cross over is to determine the suitability of the membrane for possible application in direct methanol fuel cell; however hydrogen fuel is used in this work. The results obtained revealed that the blending of the membrane with CNBs improved the thermal stability, water uptake, porosity, solvent uptake, methanol crossover and proton conductivity of the membrane with more than 50...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{highlights}} the synthesis, characterization and membrane properties of new graft copolymers obtained either by direct amidation of poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) or by sulphonation of polystyrene and subsequent amidation with different poly(ether amide) s “jeffamines®” as grafts. These materials were tested as membranes for CO 2 and CH 4 separation. Firts, direct amidation of poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride. The characterization results obtained by 1 H-NMR, 13 C-NMR, GPC, DSC, and TGA demonstrated the successful synthesis of graft copolymers with PEG contents from 5 to 26 wt. % (series-ML,-MM and -MH) using poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) and Jeffamine. The graft copolymers' thermal analyses indicated the final products to be amorphous materials with glass transition temperatures decreasing for an increasing content of PEG bonded to the matrix poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride). A {{second group of}} graft copolymers (series GSMA and GPSS) were synthesized by sulfonation of poly(styrene) and poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride), respectively, and subsequent amidation with Jeffamine. The successful synthesis was proven by elemental analysis (EA), 1 H-NMR, GPC, FT-IR, and thermal analyses (DSC and TGA). Polymers of PEG contents up to 35 wt. % {{with a degree of}} sulfonation up to 24 wt. % were obtained. An increase of the PEG content in the graft-copolymer lead to a decrease of the glass transition temperature in comparison to the <b>sulphonated</b> <b>polystyrene.</b> Three series of composites membranes with different PEG contents were prepared by casting and their CO 2, N 2, and CH 4 permeabilities as well as their CO 2 /N 2 and CO 2 /CH 4 selectivities were determined. Generally, the overall CO 2 /N 2 and CO 2 /CH 4 selectivity increased with higher poly(ethylene glycol) contents. The membranes made from SMA and Jeffamine (M- 2070) (series-MH) with PEG contents of 20 – 26 wt. % exhibited a CO 2 permeability of 120 - 280 Barrer and a CO 2 /N 2 selectivity of 34 – 42 at 35 °C and 1 atm of feed pressure, which can be regarded as competitive to membranes reported in literature and to the theoretical upper bound limit defined by Freeman´s theory. The high seIectivity of the CO 2 /N 2 pair was explained by the high solubility of CO 2 in the PEG. Due to the incorporation of PEG the glass transition temperature decreased, the CO 2 permeability increased stronger than the N 2 permability, and in consequence the CO 2 /N 2 selectivity was enhanced. In case of the CO 2 /CH 4 pair the selectivity was further influenced by a decrease of the CH 4 permeability. Hence, it may be presumed that the transport of CH 4 through the membrane is controlled rather by diffusion rather than by solution. The high CO 2 permeability can be explained by two concurrent contributions, the solubility and the diffusivity. The solubility of CO 2 is higher than that of N 2 due to the significant differences in the condensability of both gases.. At the same time, the graft copolymers consisting of flexible and polar poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) segments are very attractive for the polar CO 2 molecules...|$|E
30|$|Global energy {{consumption}} {{has been steadily}} increasing {{since the beginning of}} the millennium and its demand is expected to rise in the coming times. Thus, the general awareness about alternative energy sources has increased manifold, which have a lower impact on the environment as a whole [1]. Sustainable sources of energy are to be explored and used to decrease the overall dependence on available primary sources of energy (fossil fuels) [2]. In this context, biodiesel appears to be a feasible option as its usage renders a reduction of above 90 % in emissions of total non-combusted hydrocarbons [3]. An excellent review has been published [4] describing various vegetable oil feedstock sources used for producing biodiesel. Biodiesel is mostly produced from the edible sources such as sunflower [5], soybean [6], and rapeseed [7]. This practice is not favorable towards sustainability because of the fact that it is competitive with food and would increase the cost of both edible oil and biodiesel [8]. Therefore, non-edible oils are preferred for this purpose. Castor oil is one of the most promising non-edible sources for the production of biodiesel [9]. Conventional in situ transesterification of castor oil seeds has been performed by Hincapie et al. [10]. Several catalysts such as KOH, NaOH, KOCH 3, HCl, etc. [11] have been tried in its transesterification with ethanol. Reduction in viscosity of castor methyl and ethyl ester blends have been studied [12]. Kinetics of this process has been investigated [13, 14, 15, 16, 17] by varying the alcohol to oil molar ratio as well as the temperature. In one such process [18], methanol to oil ratio was varied from 50 : 1 to 250 : 1 and temperature from 35 to 65  °C. Optimization of castor oil transesterification reaction to produce biodiesel has been reported by many authors, but optimization of tranesterification reaction by the use of ANN modeling is rare in literature. It may be concluded that these processes have not been investigated in the presence of an acid catalyst from the point of view of kinetic parameter estimation. ANN modeling can be a good approach to optimize acid catalyzed reaction for biodiesel production as it is time saving, and we can optimize biodiesel production on the pilot scale with the experimental data optimized by using ANN. The FFA content in castor oil should be less than 1 % for using alkaline catalyst [19]. If the limit of FFA is exceeded, then soap formation occurs which inhibits the suppression of ester [20]. Boucher et al. [21] used significant (50  wt%) amount of H 2 SO 4 associated with 10.86 – 93.7 methanol to FFA molar ratio for the oil–fatty acid mixture that contained 2 – 15 % FFAs. Heterogeneous catalyst (<b>sulphonated</b> <b>polystyrene</b> compounds) were employed by Soldi et al. [22] and 85 % conversion of fatty acid into methyl ester was reported at a high methanol to oil ratio of 100 : 1 and reaction time of 18  h. In the present investigation, experiments were conducted in a lab reactor; the experimental conditions were determined by design of experiment method for methanol to oil molar ratio =  6 : 1 – 25 : 1; catalyst amount (vol%) =  1 – 3; temperature (°C) =  40 – 60  °C; time duration of experiments =  4  h.|$|E
40|$|The use of gold {{nanoparticles}} (Au NPs) {{in biological}} applications has risen significantly over recent years. With {{the wide variety}} of chemical and biological functionalisation available and their distinctive optical properties, Au NPs are currently applied in a range of biological applications including sensing, labelling, drug delivery and imaging. Amongst the available particles, gold nanorods (Au NRs) are particularly useful because their distinct localised surface plasmon resonances (LSPR) in the longitudinal direction is tunable across the visible to near infrared region. This thesis demonstrates that illumination of Au NRs at the plasmon resonance wavelength can trigger neuronal cell differentiation and induce intracellular calcium transients (Ca 2 +) in NG 108 - 15 neuronal cells. These effects were also observed in <b>polystyrene</b> <b>sulphonate</b> - (PSS) and silica (SiO 2) - coated Au NRs. In addition, initial studies on fluorescent thermometry in biological tissue showed the potential to measure temperature with pixel by pixel resolution...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristic}} shapes, {{structures and}} properties of biominerals arise from their interplay with a macromolecular matrix 1, 2. The developing mineral interacts with acidic macromolecules, which are either dissolved in the crystallization medium or associated with insoluble matrix polymers 3, that affect growth habits and phase selection or completely inhibit precipitation in solution 4, 5, 6. Yet {{little is known}} about the role of matrix-immobilized acidic macromolecules in directing mineralization. Here, by using in situ liquid-phase electron microscopy to visualize the nucleation and growth of ¿CaCO 3 in a matrix of <b>polystyrene</b> <b>sulphonate</b> (PSS), we show that the binding of calcium ions to form Ca–PSS globules is a key step in the formation of metastable amorphous ¿calcium carbonate (ACC), an important precursor phase in many biomineralization systems 7. Our findings demonstrate that ion binding can play a significant role in directing nucleation, independently of any control over the free-energy barrier to nucleation...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{synthetic}} polyanions to suppress thermo-aggregation of the oligomeric enzymes (glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate aminotransferase) has been established. The {{ability of the}} polyanions to reduce the thermo-aggregation increased in the order poly(methacrylic acid) < poly(acrylic acid) < sodium <b>poly(styrene</b> <b>sulphonate),</b> which agreed well with the increase, in the same order, of the charge density of the chains. The lengthening of the chains, {{as well as the}} rise in their relative content, resulted in an increase of the ability to reduce thermo-aggregation, mentioned above. Complete prevention of the enzyme aggregation was achieved when highly charged polyanions of a relatively high degree of polymerization were used in a concentration sufficient to solubilize the protein. Complexing with the polyanions prevented thermo-aggregation of the enzymes, but not their thermo-denaturation. The adverse effect of the complexing polyanions on the catalytic activity was reduced by the addition of a synthetic polycation, which resulted in a significant reactivation (up to 40...|$|R
