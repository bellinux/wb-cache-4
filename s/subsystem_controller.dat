Its core is an embedded dual function webserver/computer workstation connected to the product controller's test ports (as used in retrofit applications, or integrated directly into the controller for new products), hence providing access to operational cycles, sensor and other information in a clustered, internet addressable node that allows for local or remote access, {{and the ability to}} host remotely reconfigurable software that can collect and process data from its mated <b>subsystem</b> <b>controller</b> onboard and pull in other computing resources throughout the network. It can then establish a localized wireless World Wide Web in and around the product that can be securely connected to by a mechanic with any web browser-equipped handheld independent of the greater World Wide Web, as well as seamlessly integrate into global networks when external wireless communications is available - thus creating data Digital Twins at the factory, connecting deployed product usage in the Product lifecycle with constantly updated digital threads. This allows for an integrated approach which enables both offline and online updates to occur. Legacy systems usually require a human to physically connect a laptop to the system controller or a telematic solution to manually collect data and carry it back to a location where it can be later transferred to the factory or to restricted webserver-based download sites for offboard analysis.|$|E

40|$|Augmented {{robust control}} of a {{free-floating}} flexible space robot Xiao-Yan Yu The flexibility of the joints and links of space robots is considerable, arising from elasticity of the joints and links. Controlling such a robot {{is more complex than}} controlling rigid one due to the interactions of rigid and flexible motion. Only a single actuation signal could be applied at each joint, whilst it has to control the motion of the link joint, the flexure of both the joints itself, and the attached link for a flexible space robot. To investigate such an underactuated flexible-link flexible-joint space robot, a free-floating space manipulator with one flexible link and two flexible revolute joints was presented in this paper. The dynamical Lagrange equation was established, and a singularly perturbed model has been formulated. The model consisted of a rigid subsystem, a flexible-link fast subsystem, and a flexible-joint fast subsystem. Based on the two-time-scale separation of the manipulator dynamics, a reduced-order controller was designed. This controller consisted of a rigid control component and two fast control components. Based only on the possible bound of the uncertainty, an augmented robust control law was constructed for the rigid coun-terpart of the flexible-link flexible-joint robot. The flexible-joint fast <b>subsystem</b> <b>controller</b> would stabilize the elastic vibrations at the joints, and the flexible-link fast <b>subsystem</b> <b>controller</b> would damp out the vibration of the flexible link.

30|$|The {{inner layer}} with short time scale loop is {{integrated}} in the onboard controller inside each glider. This layer receives the command waypoints {{from the outer}} layer and control the glider {{to move to the}} desired waypoints. Since endurance of the glider is very important for the long-term marine observation, a LEC (least energy consumption) algorithm is designed to minimize the energy cost in the glider motion. The distance between neighbor waypoints is calculated as the input of LEC and the optimal control variables are generated as the optimization output. The influence of ocean flow is considered by the controller. The glider gets its position every time it surfaces and estimates the flow velocity by comparing the position with the dead-reckoned position (DK position) or that of the desired waypoint. The controller makes decision to decrease the influence of the flow by determining the heading angle of the glider and outputs the flow speed into the LEC to obtain optimal control variables. The onboard <b>subsystem</b> <b>controller</b> based on PID control will achieve the motion control under the optimal command. This control cycle loops every profile, so the inner layer is under a short-time loop by profiles.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{principle}} of integrated vehicle dynamics control through proposing a new control configuration to coordinate active steering subsystems and dynamic stability control (DSC) subsystems. The active steering subsystems include Active Front Steering (AFS) and Active Rear Steering (ARS); the dynamic stability control subsystems include driveline based, brake based and driveline plus brake based DSC subsystems. A nonlinear vehicle handling model is developed for this study, incorporating the load transfer effects and nonlinear tyre characteristics. This model consists of 8 degrees of freedom that include longitudinal, lateral and yaw motions of the vehicle and body roll motion relative to the chassis about the roll axis {{as well as the}} rotational dynamics of four wheels. The lateral vehicle dynamics are analysed for the entire handling region and two distinct control objectives are defined, i. e. steerability and stability which correspond to yaw rate tracking and sideslip motion bounding, respectively. Active steering subsystem controllers and dynamic stability <b>subsystem</b> <b>controller</b> are designed by using the Sliding Mode Control (SMC) technique and phase-plane method, respectively. The former is used as the steerability controller to track the reference yaw rate and the latter serves as the stability controller to bound the sideslip motion of the vehicle. Both stand-alone controllers are evaluated over a range of different handling regimes. The stand-alone steerability controllers are found to be very effective in improving vehicle steering response up to the handling limit and the stand-alone stability controller is found to be capable of performing the task of maintaining vehicle stability at the operating points where the active steering subsystems cannot. Based on the two independently developed stand-alone controllers, a novel rule based integration scheme for AFS and driveline plus brake based DSC is proposed to optimise the overall vehicle performance by minimising interactions between the two subsystems and extending functionalities of individual subsystems. The proposed integrated control system is assessed by comparing it to corresponding combined control. Through the simulation work conducted under critical driving conditions, the proposed integrated control system is found to lead to a trade-off between stability and limit steerability, improved vehicle stability and reduced influence on the longitudinal vehicle dynamics.

The capabilities of the algorithm are demonstrated by application to partitioned integrated flight/propulsion control design for a modern fighter aircraft in the short approach to landing task. The partitioning optimization is shown to lead to reduced-order subcontrollers that match the closed-loop command tracking and decoupling performance achieved by a high-order centralized controller...|$|R
40|$|Automatic {{guidance}} of agricultural vehicles would lighten {{the job of}} the operator, while accuracy is needed to obtain an optimal yield. Accurately navigating a tractor consists of controlling different dynamic subsystems (steering and speed). Instead of modeling the subsystem interaction prior to model-based control, we have developed a control algorithm which learns the interactions on-line from the measured feedback error. In this approach, a PD controller is working in parallel with a type- 2 fuzzy neural network. While the former ensures the stability of the related subsystem, the latter learns the system dynamics and becomes the leading controller. In this study, two combinations of a PD controller with a type- 2 fuzzy neural network are implemented: one for the yaw dynamics and one for the traction dynamics. The interactions between these subsystems are thus not taken into account explicitly, but considered as disturbances to be handled by the <b>subsystem</b> <b>controllers.</b> A novel sliding mode control theory-based learning algorithm is used to train the type- 2 fuzzy neural networks, and the convergence of the parameters is shown by using a Lyapunov function. status: publishe...|$|R
