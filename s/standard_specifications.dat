25|$|The {{news of the}} {{successful}} use of rockets spread through Europe. In England Sir William Congreve began to experiment privately. First, he experimented {{with a number of}} black-powder formulas and set down <b>standard</b> <b>specifications</b> of composition. He also standardized construction details and used improved production techniques. Also, his designs made it possible to choose either an explosive (ball charge) or incendiary warhead.|$|E
25|$|In wet {{and cold}} climates, {{reinforced}} concrete for roads, bridges, parking structures and other structures {{that may be}} exposed to deicing salt may benefit from use of corrosion-resistant reinforcement such as uncoated, low carbon/chromium (micro composite), epoxy-coated, hot dip galvanised or stainless steel rebar. Good design and a well-chosen concrete mix will provide additional protection for many applications. Uncoated, low carbon/chromium rebar looks similar to standard carbon steel rebar due to its lack of a coating; its highly corrosion-resistant features are inherent in the steel microstructure. It can be identified by the unique ASTM specified mill marking on its smooth, dark charcoal finish. Epoxy coated rebar can easily be identified by the light green colour of its epoxy coating. Hot dip galvanized rebar may be bright or dull grey depending on length of exposure, and stainless rebar exhibits a typical white metallic sheen that is readily distinguishable from carbon steel reinforcing bar.

2500|$|Damage {{sustained}} in recent earthquakes, {{such as the}} 1995 Kobe earthquake, have also highlighted that the seismic behavior of a structure is highly influenced {{not only by the}} response of the superstructure, but also by the response of the foundation and the ground as well. [...] Hence, the modern seismic design codes, such as <b>Standard</b> <b>Specifications</b> for Concrete Structures: Seismic Performance Verification JSCE 2005 [...] stipulate that the response analysis should be conducted by taking into consideration a whole structural system including superstructure, foundation and ground.|$|E
2500|$|Since RFID tags can be {{attached}} to cash, clothing, and possessions, or implanted in animals and people, the possibility of reading personally-linked information without consent has raised serious privacy concerns. These concerns resulted in <b>standard</b> <b>specifications</b> development [...] addressing privacy and security issues. [...] ISO/IEC 18000 and ISO/IEC 29167 use on-chip cryptography methods for untraceability, tag and reader authentication, and over-the-air privacy. ISO/IEC 20248 specifies a digital signature data structure for RFID and barcodes providing data, source and read method authenticity.

2500|$|In 1958, new Standard model {{retained}} most specifications of the 1957 Goldtop, including PAF humbucker pickups, a maple top, and a tune-o-matic {{bridge with}} a stop tailpiece or Bigsby vibrato tailpiece. The gold color used since 1952 {{was replaced by}} a cherry-red version of the Sunburst finish long used on Gibson's flat-top and archtop acoustic and hollow electric guitars. Since the maple cap was now visible, tops were made either with a solid [...] "plaintop" [...] piece of maple or two bookmatched pieces of figured (curly or quilted) maple. To differentiate from the earlier Goldtop model, the new Les Paul was referred to as The Les Paul <b>Standard.</b> <b>Specifications</b> during 1958–60 varied from year to year and also from guitar to guitar. Typical 1958 Les Paul Standard necks had a thicker neck, thinner frets and lower fret height, which changed during the course of 1959 to develop into typical 1960 necks with a thinner cross-section and wider, higher frets. The cherry dye used on the 1958–59 models faded rapidly from ultraviolet light exposure, so in early 1960 Gibson switched to a new, fade-resistant formulation which was also less translucent and slightly more orange; this is sometimes called the [...] "tomato soup burst." [...] Original production of the Standards lasted from 1958 to early 1961. Only about 1,700 of these early models were made and have subsequently become highly valuable.The 1958–60 Standard is one of the highest priced vintage guitar models on the market, ranked at # on the 2011 Top 25 published by Vintage Guitar, and worth between $225,000 and $375,000.|$|E

50|$|Because many {{different}} types of phantoms had been used to calibrate in vivo counting systems, the importance of establishing <b>standard</b> <b>specifications</b> for phantoms was emphasized at the 1990 international meeting of in vivo counting professionals held at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (Kramer and Inn 1991). The consensus of the meeting attendees was that <b>standard</b> <b>specifications</b> were needed for the BOMAB phantom. The <b>standard</b> <b>specifications</b> for the BOMAB phantom provide the basis for a consistent phantom design for calibrating in vivo measurement systems.
