5|$|Before 1658, one of {{the provinces}} of Skåneland, <b>Scania</b> proper, had {{consisted}} of four counties: the counties of Malmøhus, Landskrone, Helsingborg and Christianstad. When Skåneland was annexed by Sweden, {{one of the}} counties of <b>Scania,</b> Kristianstad County, was merged with Blekinge to form one {{of a total of}} three Blekinge counties.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Ascheberg, the Governor Generalship was {{dismantled}} into a separate county governor {{for each of the}} Swedish provinces Blekinge, Halland and <b>Scania.</b> However, a Governor Generalship was reinstated in the province of <b>Scania</b> during the Napoleonic War, when Johan Christopher Toll became the last Governor-General in the region, a post he held 1801–09.|$|E
5|$|The 20-year-old {{king was}} inexperienced and {{considered}} ill-served amidst {{what has been}} called the anarchy in the nation. He dedicated autumn in his newly formed camp in <b>Scania</b> to arm the Swedish nation for battle in the Scanian War. The Swedish soldiers in <b>Scania</b> were outnumbered and outequipped by the Danes. In May 1676, they invaded <b>Scania,</b> taking Landskrona and Helsingborg, then proceeding through Bohuslän towards Halmstad. The King had to grow up quickly. He suddenly found himself alone and under great pressure.|$|E

5|$|In the Treaty of Roskilde {{two years}} earlier, Denmark-Norway {{had been forced}} to cede the Danish provinces of <b>Scania,</b> Halland, Blekinge, the island of Bornholm and the Norwegian provinces Trøndelag and Båhuslen. The Treaty of Copenhagen reaffirmed the Swedish rule over <b>Scania,</b> Halland, Blekinge, and Bohuslän, while Bornholm and Trøndelag were returned. It was a {{significant}} victory for Denmark-Norway, but it did not result in a reversal of the costly earlier peace. The treaty of 1660 established political borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway which have lasted to the present.|$|E
5|$|The {{king had}} seen bitter resentment from the Scanian peasants during the Scanian War and was {{particularly}} tough on that province. The guerrilla Snapphane movement, in northern <b>Scania,</b> had attacked his soldiers and stolen his money. They also had {{strong support from}} the local villages. Charles remained sceptical about the Scanian inhabitants throughout his life. He did not allow soldiers from <b>Scania</b> in his Scanian regiment: the 1,200 soldiers that were to be stationed {{there had to be}} recruited from more northern provinces. He also advocated rough treatment of the inhabitants and the first Governor-General of <b>Scania,</b> his trusted aide Johan Gyllenstierna (governor-general 1679–1680), was notably brutal in his treatment of the locals. The rule of Rutger von Ascheberg (governor-general 1680–1693), proved more lenient.|$|E
25|$|Over 90% of <b>Scania's</b> {{population}} live {{in urban}} areas. In 2000, the Øresund Bridge—the longest combined road and rail bridge in Europe—linked Malmö and Copenhagen, making <b>Scania's</b> population {{part of a}} 3.6 million total population in the Øresund Region. In 2005, the region had 9,200 commuters crossing the bridge daily, {{the vast majority of}} them from Malmö to Copenhagen.|$|R

5|$|Because of {{geographical}} proximity, minor rivalries exist with Trelleborgs FF and Landskrona BoIS, which are both also located in <b>Scania.</b> The main rivals {{of the club}} are Helsingborgs IF, IFK Göteborg and IFK Malmö. The rivalry between Malmö FF and Helsingborgs IF has existed since Malmö FF were promoted up to Allsvenskan in the 1930s, and is primarily geographic, since both teams are from <b>Scania</b> in southern Sweden. The rivalry with IFK Göteborg relates more to title clashes; the two are the most successful clubs in Swedish football history and the only two to have appeared in European cup finals, IFK Göteborg in the UEFA Cup in 1982 and 1987 and Malmö FF in the European Cup in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Few dinosaur remains {{have been}} found in Scandinavia. The {{mainland}} of western Denmark is an unlikely region to find dinosaur remains, since the Mesozoic sediments there are marine Maastrichtian chalk. Fossils of non-dinosaurian marine animals, including mosasaurs and plesiosaurs, {{have been found}} in these deposits. Mesozoic deposits in <b>Scania,</b> Sweden, are much richer in fossils, including those of dinosaurs. The Danish island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea was part of the same land mass as <b>Scania</b> (the Scandinavian-Russian continent), and has a similar geology. The southwestern part of the island is the only place in Denmark which has yielded dinosaur remains.|$|E

5|$|Ystad in the {{southern}} Swedish region of <b>Scania</b> which was formerly part of Denmark still has some 300 half-timbered houses, several of them of historic importance. The oldest surviving half-timbered house in Denmark, built in 1527, is located in Køge {{on the east coast}} of Sealand.|$|E
5|$|Godwin's wife, and {{the mother}} of his {{children}} including Harold and Edith, was Gytha Thorkelsdóttir. Her father was Thorgils Sprakaleg, a Dane whose origin is unknown, although he was probably a Dane from <b>Scania,</b> which was then in Denmark but is now part of Sweden. Gytha was very well connected as her brother Ulf married King Cnut's sister Estrith. Cnut probably arranged the marriage between Godwin and Gytha in about 1022.|$|E

5|$|In 1614, Christian IV {{began work}} on the {{construction}} of the then Danish Kristianstad in <b>Scania,</b> now in the south of Sweden, completing many of its buildings in the Renaissance style. Particularly impressive is the Church of the Trinity (1618–28) designed by Flemish-Danish architect Lorenz van Steenwinckel. It is said to be Scandinavia's finest example of a Renaissance church.|$|E
5|$|One of Frederick III's bodyguards, Statius, {{traveled}} to <b>Scania</b> {{to organize the}} peasants into Snapphane units and instigate anti-Swedish sentiment. In Malmö, a cabal of rich bourgeoisie, led by Bartholomaeus Mikkelsen, planned a revolt. The conspiracy tried to recruit one of Malmös two mayors, Efvert Wiltfang, {{but he would not}} commit himself to the uprising, even though he said he would support Frederick III. At the end of December, the Danes embarked on a foray into <b>Scania,</b> but were foiled by bad weather and poor navigation. Meanwhile, the Swedish authorities had become aware of the plot and the main leaders were arrested, among them Mikkelsen and Wildfang, and the conspirators were sentenced to death. On December 22, 1659 Mikkelsen and two others were beheaded, but in an attempt to placate the Scanian people the execution of Wiltfang and 10 others was stayed. The uprising had been averted, but rebels and insurgents continued to operate in the countryside.|$|E
5|$|Storlien, {{just on the}} Swedish side of the {{national}} border, grew up as a resort, with the first hotel established just after the railway arrived. Trade {{between the two countries}} increased, as Jämtland had easy access to the Trøndelag market. However, the freight rates were so high that it was cheaper to send some products to Trøndelag from the Swedish east coast by ship around <b>Scania.</b>|$|E

5|$|Sweden had won {{its most}} prestigious victory, and Denmark had {{suffered}} its most costly defeat. Denmark {{was forced to}} yield the provinces of <b>Scania,</b> Halland, Blekinge and the island of Bornholm. Halland had already been under Swedish control since {{the signing of the}} Treaty of Brömsebro in 1645, but they now became Swedish territory indefinitely. Denmark also had to surrender the Norwegian province Trøndelag to Sweden.|$|E
5|$|The term {{is mostly}} used in {{historical}} contexts {{and not in}} daily speech. In Danish, Skånelandene is used more often. The terms have no political implications as the region is not a geopolitical entity but a cultural region, without officially established political borders. In some circumstances, the term Skåneland, {{as opposed to the}} terms Skånelandskapen and Skånelandene, can also be used as a figure of speech for the province <b>Scania.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although most Gothic {{architecture}} in Denmark {{is to be}} found in churches and monasteries, there are examples in the secular field too. Glimmingehus (1499–1506), a rectangular castle in <b>Scania,</b> clearly presents Gothic features. It was commissioned by the Danish nobleman Jens Holgersen Ulfstand who called on the services of Adam van Düren, a North German master who also worked on Lund Cathedral. The building contains many defensive features of the times, including parapets, false doors, dead-end corridors, murder-holes for pouring boiling pitch over the attackers, moats, drawbridges and various other death traps to protect the nobles against peasant uprisings.|$|E
