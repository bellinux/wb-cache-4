25|$|Admiral Penrose chose Gleaner to {{take the}} dispatches {{concerning}} the operation to create the bridge back to Britain, but asked Branch to wait at Saint-Jean-de-Luz {{for the arrival of}} one of General Lord Wellington's officers with dispatches from the general. The weather worsened on 1 April but Gleaner was well-anchored and prepared and rode out the storm until the morning of 2 April. Unfortunately, the storm drove a merchant sloop across Gleaners bows. Gleaners crew separated the two vessels, and the crew of the sloop was able to take shelter on the ketch before their sloop sank. As the winds worsened they drove Gleaner under the bows of a transport brig, where she became so trapped that she started to come apart from the action of the wind and waves. By 5pm Gleaner was so damaged that her crew and that of the sloop transferred to the transport brig. The combined crews were able to cut Gleaner free. The waves <b>swept</b> <b>her</b> onto the beach and she disappeared within minutes. The brig was able to rid out the storm until the next day, but then her crew was forced to cut her cables and to drive her on to the beach. All the survivors made it safely ashore. In all, the storm wrecked 17 vessels.|$|E

Her crew consisted of 369 officers and ratings.

500|$|Precipitation from Hurricane Elena {{reached into}} {{southern}} Georgia {{and parts of}} South Carolina, with little impact aside from meager drought relief.

500|$|Closely {{following}} Victory as {{she passed}} through the Franco-Spanish line across the bows of the French flagship Bucentaure, Harvey was forced to sheer away quickly, just missing Victorys stern. Turning to starboard, Harvey made for the 140-gun Spanish ship Santísima Trinidad and engaged her for twenty minutes, taking raking fire from two French ships, the 80-gun Neptune and the 74-gun Redoutable, as she did so. Redoutables broadside carried away Temeraires mizzen topmast. While avoiding a broadside from Neptune, Temeraire narrowly avoided a collision with Redoutable. Another broadside from Neptune brought down Temeraires fore-yard and main topmast, and damaged her fore mast and bowsprit. Harvey now became aware that the Redoutable had come up alongside the Victory and <b>swept</b> <b>her</b> decks with musket fire and grenades. A large party of Frenchmen now gathered on her decks ready to board the Victory. Temeraire was brought around; appearing suddenly out of the smoke of the battle and slipping across Redoutables stern, Temeraire discharged a double-shotted broadside into her. Jean Jacques Étienne Lucas, captain of the Redoutable, recorded that [...] "...the three-decker – who had doubtless perceived that the Victory had ceased fire and would inevitably be taken – ran foul of the Redoutable to starboard and overwhelmed us with the point-blank fire of all her guns. It {{would be impossible to}} describe the horrible carnage produced by the murderous broadside of this ship. More than two hundred of our brave lads were killed or wounded by it." ...|$|E

They would hold hands and eat make-believe meals inside their playhouse built from cardboard, where they [...] "vowed to be boyfriend and girlfriend forever." [...] Their last play date turned tragic when, after {{fighting}} with some older children over a play area by a creek, Lulu was pushed into the water. A fast-moving current <b>swept</b> <b>her</b> away while she screamed Kelly's name. Shortly after, she was found dead downstream. Kelly calls Lulu his very first musical inspiration.|$|E
2500|$|In 1920, while {{returning}} {{to school on}} a train, she met Günther Quandt, a rich German industrialist twice her age. [...] It is claimed that although a physically unremarkable man, Quandt courted her at school by posing as a family friend and <b>swept</b> <b>her</b> off her feet with courtesy and grand gestures. He demanded that she change her name back to Ritschel (having borne {{the name of her}} mother and stepfather, Friedländer, at her own request, for many years) while converting from Ritschel's nominal Catholicism to Protestantism. She and Quandt were married on 4 January 1921, and her first child, Harald, was born on 1 November 1921.|$|E
