50|$|In this setup, {{the most}} common, the speargun is {{attached}} to the shaft by a line. The line is usually a heavy monofilament (300-400 lb test), spectra, or other spectra-like material (braided line) with 400-600+lb rating. The line wraps around the bottom or side of the gun upon loading and releases via a mechanical release or tension release to allow the line to travel with the spear after firing. There are typically two different methods of connecting the line to the spear shaft, either a <b>slide</b> <b>ring</b> that travels up and down the shaft to machined stopping points or via a hole drilled through some portion of the shaft (usually the rear). This is the most common method for taking fish by speargun and the majority of the other types of setups use the mentioned connection options to the shaft. Some newer setups offer an option to quickly attach line to, or disconnect from, a shaft making for a line or free shaft option on a single speargun.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The correct {{behaviour}} of a non-contacting {{face seal}} {{depends on a}} number of parameters and physical phenomena occurring in the clearance between the <b>sliding</b> <b>rings.</b> The hydrodynamic and thermodynamic phenomena in the clearance of a face seal, on the other hand, are dependent on pressure, flow speed and temperature of the sealing fluid, clearance dimensions, material of the <b>sliding</b> <b>rings</b> and operation parameters of the fluidflow machine. Under normal operating conditions fluid friction is observed in a noncontacting face seal. The work discusses the effect of a temperature change in a noncontacting face seal under fluid friction and boundary dry friction conditions. Key words: face seal, temperature identification, thermodynamics effect. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} doubly-fed motor {{has less}} reliability because it needs carbon brushes and <b>sliding</b> <b>rings</b> {{which are not}} highly reliable. The brushless doubly-fed machine costs a lot for its framework requires special designing and processing. To overcome the disadvantages of the two kinds of motors, this paper focuses on a novel method of motor speed regulation {{which is based on}} rotating feeding. The motor speed changing around its rated speed can be realized based on the method without any carbon brush or <b>sliding</b> <b>ring</b> on the prosaic electrical motors. On the basis of the full controlled thyristor rectifying bridge structure, the basic idea is introduced; {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} this method are analyzed. This kind of systems can replace the brushed or brushless double-fed systems. They are very suitable for driving fans or pumps, or power-generating systems with variable speed constant frequency such as wind power or water power generating systems...|$|R

40|$|Variable {{displacement}} {{vane pumps}} represent {{one of the}} most innovative type of pump for automotive engines. The vane pump with a <b>sliding</b> <b>ring,</b> is a mechanism that makes it possible to change the capacity of the pump {{as a function of the}} engine speed, allowing to optimize of the oil flow, according to the engine demand, with considerable power saving. The main components of a variable displacement vane pumps are: vanes, rotor, inner <b>rings</b> and a <b>sliding</b> <b>ring.</b> During operation, the vanes are in contact with the inner surface of the outer (<b>sliding)</b> <b>ring</b> due to the effect of centrifugal loads; in addition high slip velocities occur in the contact area; as a consequence, a critical aspect of this kind of pumps is represented by the wear which takes place on the contact surfaces. Another potential mechanism of damaging process is attributed to vanes sticking in rotor cavities, causing a sudden increase in contact loads. This paper illustrates a summary of a research activity, which was carried out with the aim of analyzing the operating conditions of vanes pumps. The study was conducted with reference to pumps with vanes number ranging from 5 to 9, in order to evidence the influence of some design parameters on results. The numerical analysis were carried out by using multi-body models, that were developed with MSC. Adams® code. In these analyses any effect of the viscous oil inside the pump was neglected, focusing the attention on mechanisms geometry; moreover, the hypothesis of plane analysis was assumed. Some experimental tests were also carried out with a prototype, which was tested up to very hard conditions in order to highlight wear and damage mechanisms...|$|R

50|$|Mechanical seals of boiler {{feedwater}} pumps often {{show signs}} of electrical corrosion. The relative movement between the <b>sliding</b> <b>ring</b> and the stationary ring provokes static charging which is not diverted due to the very low conductivity of the boiler water below one micro-Siemens per cm μS/cm. Within short periods of operation - in some cases {{only a few hundred}} operational hours - pieces having the size of finger tips break off from the sliding and/or the stationary ring and cause rapid increases in leakage current. Diamond-coated (DLC) mechanical seals avoid this problem and extend durability remarkably.|$|R

A particular segment is tight (small in size) or loose (of the order of the overall size of the paraknot) depending on both the number of slip-links it incorporates and its competition with other segments. When self-avoiding interactions are included, scaling arguments can be used to predict the statistics of segment sizes for certain paraknot configurations. Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures, REVTeX...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of analytical solution of the model of heat transfer for non-contacting face seals. Comparative analyses were performed for various physical properties of materials used for <b>slide</b> <b>rings.</b> A mathematical model includes a series of differential equations of partial derivatives with generally used boundary conditions, i. e. the Reynold’s equation, energy equation and heat transfer equations, which describe the heat transfer in sealing rings with surrounding medium. Heat transfer equation is written in the Cartesian coordinate system and solved using the Green’s functions method. Theoretical studies made it possible to draw a number of practical conclusions on the phenomena of heat transfer in the node seal. The presented model will allow more accurate identification of the heat transfer mechanism in the node seal. The results will help to select appropriate materials for sealing rings, depending on operating conditions of non-contacting face seals...|$|R

40|$|Template-directed {{protocols}} {{provide a}} routine {{approach to the}} synthesis of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), in which the mechanical bonds are stabilized by {{a wide variety of}} weak interactions. In this paper, we describe a strategy for the preparation of neutral [2]catenanes with <b>sliding</b> interlocked electron-rich <b>rings,</b> starting from two degenerate donor-acceptor [2]catenanes, consisting of a tetracationic cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) cyclophane (CBPQT 4 +) and crown ethers containing either (i) hydroquinone (HQ) or (ii) 1, 5 -dioxynaphthalene (DNP) recognition units and carrying out four-electron reductions of the cyclophane components to their neutral forms. The donor-acceptor interactions between the CBPQT 4 + ring and both HQ and DNP units present in the crown ethers that stabilize the [2]catenanes are weakened upon reduction of the cyclophane components to their radical cationic states and are all but absent in their fully reduced states. Characterization in solution performed by UV-Vis, EPR and NMR spectroscopic probes reveals that changes in the redox properties of the [2]catenanes result in a substantial decrease of the energy barriers for the circumrotation and pirouetting motions of the interlocked rings, which glide freely through one another in the neutral states. The solid-state structures of the fully reduced catenanes reveal profound changes in the relative dispositions of the interlocked rings, with the glycol chains of the crown ethers residing in the cavities of the neutral CBPQT 0 rings. Quantum mechanical investigations of the energy levels associated with the four different oxidation states of the catenanes support this interpretation. Catenanes and rotaxanes with <b>sliding</b> <b>rings</b> are expected to display unique properties...|$|R

40|$|Kinetochores remain {{attached}} to microtubule (MT) tips during mitosis {{even as the}} tips assemble and disassemble under their grip, allowing filament dynamics to produce force and move chromosomes. The specific proteins that mediate tip attachment are uncertain, and the mechanism of MT-dependent force production is unknown. Recent work suggests that the Dam 1 complex, {{an essential component of}} kinetochores in yeast, may contribute directly to kinetochore–MT attachment and force production, perhaps by forming a <b>sliding</b> <b>ring</b> encircling the MT. To test these hypotheses, we developed an in vitro motility assay where beads coated with pure recombinant Dam 1 complex were bound to the tips of individual dynamic MTs. The Dam 1 -coated beads remained tip-bound and underwent assembly- and disassembly-driven movement over ≈ 3 μm, comparable to chromosome displacements in vivo. Dam 1 -based attachments to assembling tips were robust, supporting 0. 5 – 3 pN of tension applied with a feedback-controlled optical trap as the MTs lengthened ≈ 1 μm. The attachments also harnessed energy from MT disassembly to generate movement against tension. Reversing the direction of force (i. e., switching to compressive force) caused the attachments to disengage the tip and slide over the filament, but sliding was blocked by areas where the MT was anchored to a coverslip, consistent with a coupling structure encircling the filament. Our findings demonstrate how the Dam 1 complex may contribute directly to MT-driven chromosome movement...|$|R
