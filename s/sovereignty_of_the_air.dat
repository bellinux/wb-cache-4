40|$|<b>The</b> idea <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people {{offers a}} concept which allows searching for {{legitimacy}} <b>of</b> power. <b>The</b> legitimacy <b>of</b> power is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key structures establishing a relation {{between those who}} govern {{and those who are}} governed. Whether this relation is accepted, acceptable, functional, desirable or undesirable is a matter <b>of</b> finding <b>the</b> very definition <b>of</b> <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people as such. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this doctoral thesis, titled <b>The</b> Concept <b>of</b> <b>Sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> People and the Political Party System in the First Czechoslovak Republic (1918 - 1938) and in the Czech Republic since 1993, is, firstly, to define <b>the</b> concepts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people, on one hand, and sovereignty, on the other hand, in the historical, political and legal context from the ancient times up to now while reflecting <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> political parties in relation to <b>the</b> <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people. Secondly, this thesis aims at exploring and describing <b>the</b> functioning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party systems in the interwar Czechoslovakia and in the Czech Republic after 1993. Thirdly, this thesis seeks to answer the following questions: who represents the people in liberal democracies which are based on <b>sovereignty</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people; how do the people exercise their power; and what is <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political parties in this process...|$|R
