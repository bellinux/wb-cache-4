60|$|Her eyebrows were faintly contracted. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> pathetically.|$|E
60|$|Wingate laughed softly. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with {{twinkling}} eyes.|$|E
60|$|He obeyed mutely. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with bright, unquailing eyes.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him; it was {{the very}} spot on which a couple of hours before <b>she</b> had <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her mother. [...] "You're free--you're free." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Britling {{as if she}} {{measured}} his understanding.|$|R
60|$|The woman hesitated. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{the clock}} and down again.|$|R
60|$|And <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> half smiling, half pouting; {{altogether}} bewitching.|$|E
60|$|She {{had been}} brooding. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{suddenly}} in surprise.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> {{with her}} grey eyes, humiliated and lonely.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> a {{sound and}} saw her father {{standing}} in the doorway.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{last and}} there was a slight frown upon her forehead.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me defensively and for {{a moment}} neither of us spoke.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> almost for {{the first}} time since her entrance.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> shyly, {{yet with}} unmistakable love transfiguring her countenance.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with {{a little}} grimace and patted his hand.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the spire {{and then}} {{at him with a}} faintly quizzical expression.|$|R
60|$|She {{broke the}} seal, {{went to the}} table, and read. Then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me.|$|R
60|$|In {{surprise}} <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me, {{and then}} down at the pearls upon her satin slippers.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> with an {{expression}} of pleading in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and answered, not him, but her own thoughts.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{and to his}} amazement {{her eyes}} were swimming.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me {{as though}} asking for {{confirmation}} of her views. I shook my head.|$|R
60|$|Hetty turned very white. Then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Harry, {{and then}} she did not say a single word.|$|R
60|$|I set {{more food}} before the famished child and kissed her. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me with {{wondering}} eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> He stood {{a shadowy}} {{presence}} beyond the light.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and {{a slight}} {{sinister}} smile contracted her white face.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> and he {{saw that}} her face was unusually pale.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> last, {{ashamed of}} her tears, ashamed that a rogue {{should have seen}} how keenly she suffered.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me with {{a little}} smile. I think she must have {{forgotten}} {{the pain in her}} foot.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} a swift bright look; next moment shakes her head, sighs, and looks down again.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him</b> for one moment, then on {{the ground}} again, without speaking.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him,</b> {{and he was}} {{astonished}} to find how pale she was.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>him.</b> The waiter hovered, poising for his swoop. Suddenly she smiled.|$|E
60|$|RAINA (placing {{her hands}} on his {{shoulder}} as <b>she</b> <b>looks</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him with admiration and worship). My hero! My king.|$|R
60|$|I came {{slowly back}} to the table, and stood facing her across it. <b>She</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me with very piteous eyes.|$|R
60|$|She {{was leaning}} back in her chair, her hands behind her head, a posture she often assumed. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> me amusedly.|$|R
