She wrote a ballad in the 1920s lamenting the death of a 22-year-old vagrant who was beaten to death in a labor camp, titled [...] "Martin Tabert of North Dakota is Walking Florida Now".

2500|$|On May 20, 2010, Nick Gillespie and Matt Welch of Reason {{announced}} {{the winners of}} the publication's [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" [...] contest. Gillespie and Welch warned the reader not to view the image [...] "if you are offended by graphical representations of the Prophet Mohammed." [...] Of the images highlighted, Gillespie and Welch explained: [...] "The <b>single</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> element–and the <b>thing</b> that ties these selections together–is that each image forces the viewer to do two things. First, they consciously call into question the nature of representation, no small matter in fights over whether it is allowed under Islamic law to depict Mohammed ... Second, each of the images forces the viewer to actively participate not simply in the creation of meaning but of actually constructing the image itself." [...] There were two images in the position of runner-up – one was an artistic rendition of a tobacco smoking pipe. The depiction references surrealist artist René Magritte, and includes the text, [...] "This is not a pipe. This is Muhammed." [...] The Reason journalists commented that the image toyed with Magritte's [...] "famous statement about the necessary disjuncture between a picture and the thing it seeks to represent." [...] The second runner-up was a parody of the Where's Waldo? series, and the winner was a connect the dots picture. Commenting on the winner of the Reason contest, Gillespie and Welch concluded, [...] "There is a deeper lesson here: Connect the dots and discover that we all must be Spartacus on Everybody Draw Mohammad Day. And that in a free society, every day is Everybody Draw Mohammed Day." ...|$|R
