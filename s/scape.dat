5|$|Most {{worker and}} soldier {{termites}} are completely blind {{as they do}} not have a pair of eyes. However, some species, such as Hodotermes mossambicus, have compound eyes which they use for orientation and to distinguish sunlight from moonlight. The alates have eyes along with lateral ocelli. Lateral ocelli, however, are not found in all termites. Like other insects, termites have a small tongue-shaped labrum and a clypeus; the clypeus is divided into a postclypeus and anteclypeus. Termite antennae have a number of functions such as the sensing of touch, taste, odours (including pheromones), heat and vibration. The three basic segments of a termite antenna include a <b>scape,</b> a pedicel (typically shorter than the <b>scape),</b> and the flagellum (all segments beyond the <b>scape</b> and pedicel). The mouth parts contain a maxillae, a labium, and a set of mandibles. The maxillae and labium have palps that help termites sense food and handling.|$|E
5|$|The {{fence that}} {{separates}} the park from the city runs along a highway leaving the airport, this is one fact many Kenyans are proud of â€“ this park is the only natural safari park that has a city <b>scape</b> background {{that can be seen}} from almost any part of the park, as seen in the picture below of the giraffe and the sky scrapers.|$|E
5|$|The {{flowers are}} {{arranged}} in umbelliform inflorescences which are pauciflor or pluriflor (2-14 flowers), supported on an erect hollow <b>scape</b> (flower stem) which is 2075cm (12"30") tall and 2.55cm (1"2") in diameter with two free bracts forming a spathe which is bivalve with free leaflets at its base.|$|E
25|$|Garlic <b>scapes</b> {{are removed}} to focus all the garlic's energy into bulb growth. The <b>scapes</b> can be eaten raw or cooked.|$|R
30|$|For Parker (2001), space {{should be}} {{represented}} with nested containers (i.e., <b>scapes).</b> <b>Scapes</b> dynamically represent space, identity type, and group membership. <b>Scapes</b> {{should be allowed}} to act as agents. This treatment allows complete nesting of models. Agents, however, should not have to explicitly address the nature of <b>scapes,</b> which greatly simplifies agent specifications and reduces the chances for errors. Agent behavior specification and scheduling should occur only at the scape-level, never at the individual level. This treatment allows behaviors to be dynamically changed and permits sophisticated, behavior-based designs of experiments.|$|R
50|$|Allium caesium {{produces}} round bulbs up to 15 mm across. <b>Scapes</b> {{are up to}} 65 cm tall. Leaves are {{round in}} cross-section, slightly shorter than the <b>scapes.</b> Flowers are sky-blue.|$|R
5|$|The unusual {{characteristics}} that set it {{apart from other}} species in the genus include the woody rhizome, undivided styles, and the operculate pollen. Droseraregia shares other features with the robust Tasmanian form of D.arcturi, including the lack of stipules and petioles and the non-circinate growth of the <b>scape.</b>|$|E
5|$|Female banded sugar ants {{are easily}} {{recognised}} by their black head, orange thorax and the orange-brown band that wraps around their gaster. Males {{of the species}} are completely black. The dark sides of the thorax and legs are ferruginous (rusty in colour). The <b>scape</b> (the base of the antenna) and mandibles are black, and the head is wider than the thorax. The thorax is longer than its total width and slightly compressed, and the gaster is covered with tiny black dots. Erect setae are golden in colour and absent under the head but present on the mesosoma. The setae on the tibia and <b>scape</b> are shorter than those on the mesosoma. The anterior of the gaster is lighter in colour compared to the posterior, and the dorsum of the mesosoma is outlined and curved. A worker's metanotum is absent and the eyes are bulging, while a soldier's metanotum is noticeable and the eyes are flat. The wings on the queen are dark, and the stigmata and nerves are yellow. While many ant species have a metapleural gland, the gland is not present in the banded sugar ant; the number of malpighian tubules in workers is 21.|$|E
5|$|The {{inflorescence}} is scapose, {{the single}} stem or <b>scape</b> bearing either a solitary flower or forming an umbel {{with up to}} 20 blooms. Species bearing a solitary flower include section Bulbocodium and most of section Pseudonarcissus. Umbellate species have a fleshy racemose inflorescence (unbranched, with short floral stalks) with 2 to 15 or 20 flowers, such as N. papyraceus (see illustration, left) and N. tazetta (see Table I). The flower arrangement on the inflorescence may be either with (pedicellate) or without (sessile) floral stalks.|$|E
50|$|Allium cyathophorum has thick roots but thin, fibrous bulbs. <b>Scapes</b> {{are usually}} 2-angled, up to 15 cm tall. Leaves are flat, {{narrowly}} linear, usually {{shorter than the}} <b>scapes.</b> Umbels are hemispheric with purple flowers.|$|R
50|$|The main {{features}} used to distinguish Nylanderia queens from other Prenolepis genus-group genera come {{primarily from the}} mandibles and <b>scapes.</b> Like workers, Nylanderia queens have erect macrosetae on their <b>scapes.</b> However, the macrosetae are often not as distinct as in workers because the macrosetae are often shorter and usually surrounded by {{a thick layer of}} decumbent pubescence. When considering genera such as Euprenolepis and Pseudolasius in which queens also possess macrosetae on the <b>scapes,</b> differences in mandibular tooth count will distinguish Nylanderia queens. Five teeth are present in Euprenolepis queens and five or fewer in Pseudolasius, while Nylanderia possesses six (or rarely seven) teeth. In other genera such as Paratrechina and Paraparatrechina, the queens have no erect macrosetae on their <b>scapes.</b> For Prenolepis, if erect macrosetae are present on the <b>scapes,</b> the more posterior placement of the eyes distinguishes them from Nylanderia.|$|R
50|$|Allium dentigerum has narrow, {{cylindrical}} bulbs up to 6 mm across. <b>Scapes</b> {{are up to}} 35 cm long, {{round in}} cross-section. Leaves are very narrow, usually about half {{as long as the}} <b>scapes.</b> Flowers are reddish-purple.|$|R
5|$|The single {{leafless}} stem or <b>scape,</b> appearing {{from early}} to late spring {{depending on the}} species, bears from 1 to 20 blooms. Stem shape depends on the species, some are highly compressed with a visible seam, while others are rounded. The stems are upright and located at {{the centre of the}} leaves. In a few species such as hN. hedraeanthus the stem is oblique (asymmetrical). The stem is hollow in the upper portion but towards the bulb is more solid and filled with a spongy material.|$|E
5|$|Leopoldii hybrids {{arose from}} the work of the British {{explorer}} and botanist Richard Pearce, an employee of James Veitch & Sons, a plant nursery. Pearce brought back specimens of Hippeastrum leopoldii and Hippeastrum pardinum from the Andes. These two species were notable for large flowers that were wide open and relatively symmetrical. Crossing these two species with the best of the Reginae strain produced a lineage of very large open flowered specimens, with up to 4-6 flowers on each <b>scape.</b> The Veitch nursery dominated the commercial development of Hippeastrum leopoldii and other varieties up to {{the early years of the}} twentieth century, the best of their hybrids setting the standard for modern commercial development.|$|E
5|$|In Barden and Grimaldi's article, {{the authors}} could not {{sufficiently}} identify the ant with enough confidence {{to place it}} in a subfamily. Instead, it was incertae sedis within the Formicidae. Although a recent published morphological study provided useful information on the mouthparts of basal ants, placing Cretaceous taxa is still difficult. However, synapomorphies (key diagnostic traits) {{could have been used}} to attempt to place Zigrasimecia. Key synapomorphies for Sphecomyrmine ants include <b>scape</b> (the base segment of the antenna) length; petiole (narrow waist between the thorax and abdomen); and the metapleural gland (secretory glands), as indicated by Barry Bolton's diagnosis. The morphology of Z. tonsora shows a variety of autapomorphies (derived traits) not seen in any other ant species, particularly the structure of the mandibles and mesosomal sculpturing. Another issue in placing Z. tonsora is that the status of Sphecomyrminae had rarely ever been evaluated (perhaps once) via phylogenetic methodology. Due to this, it was possible that the subfamily was not monophyletic.|$|E
50|$|Allium chrysocephalum {{produces}} narrow cylindrical bulbs about 10 mm in diameter. <b>Scapes</b> {{are up to}} 25 cm long, {{round in}} cross-section. Leaves are flat, up to 10 mm across, about half {{the length of the}} <b>scapes.</b> Flowers are bright yellow.|$|R
50|$|Allium delicatulum {{produces}} {{round to}} egg-shaped bulbs up to 15 mm across. <b>Scapes</b> {{are up to}} 25 cm tall, round in cross-section. Leaves are round and hollow, shorter than the <b>scapes.</b> Flowers have white or pink tepals with dark red midveins.|$|R
50|$|Allium galanthum forms {{a cluster}} of bulbs, each up to 3 cm in diameter. <b>Scapes</b> are up to 60 cm tall. Leaves are tubular, about half {{as long as the}} <b>scapes.</b> Umbels are spherical with a large number of white flowers.|$|R
5|$|Other {{plants that}} are {{considered}} to be protocarnivorous have sticky trichomes on some surface, such as the flower <b>scape</b> and bud of Stylidium and Plumbago, the bracts of Passiflora foetida, and leaves of Roridula. The trichomes of Stylidium, which appear below the flower, have been known to trap and kill small insects since their discovery several centuries ago, but their purpose remained ambiguous. In November 2006, Dr. Douglas Darnowski published a paper describing the active digestion of proteins when they come in contact with a trichome of a Stylidium species grown in aseptic tissue culture, proving that the plant, rather than the surface microbes, was the source of protease production. Darnowski asserts in that paper that given this evidence, Stylidium species are properly called carnivorous, though in order to fulfill the strict definition of carnivory it needs to be proven that they are capable of absorbing nutrients derived from prey and that this adaptation gives the plants some competitive advantage.|$|E
5|$|The {{plants are}} scapose, having a single central {{leafless}} hollow flower stem (<b>scape).</b> Several green or blue-green, narrow, strap-shaped leaves {{arise from the}} bulb. The plant stem usually bears a solitary flower, but occasionally a cluster of flowers (umbel). The flowers, which are usually conspicuous and white or yellow, sometimes both or rarely green, consist of a perianth of three parts. Closest to the stem (proximal) is a floral tube above the ovary, then an outer ring composed of six tepals (undifferentiated sepals and petals), and a central disc to conical shaped corona. The flowers may hang down (pendent), or be erect. There are six pollen bearing stamens surrounding a central style. The ovary is inferior (below the floral parts) consisting of three chambers (trilocular). The fruit consists of a dry capsule that splits (dehisces) releasing numerous black seeds.|$|E
25|$|A more {{complicated}} form of epigyne {{is found in}} spiders of the genus Araneus, where there is developed an appendage which is usually soft and flexible, and which is termed the <b>scape</b> or ovipositor. When there is a well-developed <b>scape,</b> the tip of it is usually more or less spoon-shaped. This part of the <b>scape</b> is termed the cochlear. The basal plate of the epigyne which bears the <b>scape,</b> and which forms a porch or hood that covers {{the opening of the}} oviduct is called the atriolum.|$|E
50|$|Allium tenuissimum {{produces}} {{a cluster of}} small, narrow bulbs. <b>Scapes</b> are up to 50 cm tall. Leaves are tubular, shorter than the <b>scapes,</b> about 10 mm in diameter. Flowers are white or pink with a narrow red midvein along each of the tepals.|$|R
50|$|Allium hookeri {{produces}} thick, fleshy {{roots and}} {{a cluster of}} thin bulbs. <b>Scapes</b> are up top 60 cm tall. Leaves are flat and narrow, about the same length as the <b>scapes</b> but only 1 cm across. Umbels are crowded with many white or greenish-yellow flowers.|$|R
50|$|Allium macranthum has short, thick {{roots and}} a {{cylindrical}} bulb. <b>Scapes</b> {{are up to}} 60 cm tall. Leaves are flat, long, and thin, about the same length as the <b>scapes</b> but less than 2 cm across. Umbels {{have only a few}} purple, bell-shaped flowers.|$|R
25|$|Oreostylidium subulatum {{is a very}} small, cÃ¦spitose, and densely tufted plant about 2-3cm tall. The 2cm long linear-subulate leaves form a basal rosette {{close to}} the ground. The leaves are glabrous with entire margins. The <b>scape,</b> arising from the rosette of leaves, is slender, erect, and about 2cm tall. The <b>scape,</b> like most species in the related genus Stylidium is covered with glandular trichomes. Each <b>scape</b> {{produces}} a single flower. The calyx is erect, stout, and very broad (nearly as broad as the ovary). The ovary is large, oblong, sub-cylindrical, tapering and jointed on to <b>scape.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>scape</b> (flowering stalk) is erect, leafless, terete or compressed.|$|E
