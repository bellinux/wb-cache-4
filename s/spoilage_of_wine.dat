The main role of microorganisms in winemaking is to convert grape sugars to alcohol, reduce wine acidity and contribute to aroma and flavor. They can also cause numerous unwelcome wine spoilage problems, which reduce wine quality and value. Winemaking processes includes multiple stages at which microbial spoilage is likely to occur and ends up with altering the quality and hygienic status of the wine. This may render the wine unacceptable, since the spoilage can include bitterness and off-flavours, and cosmetic problems such as turbidity, viscosity, sediment and film formation. The main microorganisms associated with wine spoilage are yeasts, acetic acid bacteria and lactic acid bacteria. A microbial spoilage is the consequence of inadequate working practices. These inadequate practices are derived from two principle attitudes: (1) - non-application of known practices for well identified risks and (2) - insufficient evaluation of risk levels. One of the aims of winemaking is to minimize potential for microbial spoilage and in this review are presented risks of microbial <b>spoilage</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> and their prevention. ...|$|E

These factors include {{the quality of the}} grapes, winemaking techniques and quality control throughout the winemaking process. It is thus very important that any process leading to the lowering {{of the quality of the}} wine be prevented. Evidence in the wine industry shows that bacterial spoilage is still very much a common problem in many wineries. The <b>spoilage</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> by bacteria can lead to amongst other problems, elevated volatile acidity levels, of which only a certain concentration limit in wine is permitted. Usually more than 90 % of the volatile acidity of wine consists of acetic acid. Different yeast strains, heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria (which can all be spoilage microorganisms) can produce acetic acid in high concentrations. It is thus important to be able to prevent the formation of this acid by controling the unwanted growth of these spoilage microorganisms. Acetic acid and other medium chain fatty acids, octanoic- and decanoic acid, can also lead to stuck or sluggish fermentations. A stuck or sluggish fermentation can also lead to wine spoilage, due to sugar remaining in the fermentation which can be utilized by spoilage microorganisms. Acetic- and other fatty acids enter the yeast cell by passive diffussion and releases its proton in the cytoplasm, thereby acidifying the cytoplasm and inhibiting some enzymes. These acids can also work synergistically with ethanol and its inhibitory effect is also dependent on the temperature. Yeast strains can also differ in their resistance to acetic and other medium chain fatty acids and these acids can also influence the growth of lactic acid bacteria. How acetic acid bacteria influence the winemaking process and the used measures to keep these bacteria from spoiling wine have been the subject of very little attention in the past. This was due to the belief that the anaerobic conditions prevailing in wine and the use of sulfur dioxide are enough to control these bacteria, since acetic acid bacteria were always described as being strictly aerobic microorganisms. Recently, some evidence showed that acetic acid bacteria can survive and even overcome the limits that the winemaking process places on its growth. These bacteria are also known to inhibit the yeasts growth and fermentation ability due to the production of acetic acid and other factors. A research programme on the origin of volatile acidity in South African wines had been initiated at the Department of Viticulture and Enology and at the Institute for Wine Biotechnology at the University of Stellenbosch after increases in volatile acidity in different South African wines had been reported. This spurred us to investigate the occurrence of acetic acid bacteria in South African red wine fermentations, which forms part of this study, and to identify the dominant acetic acid bacterial strains. The sulfur dioxide resistance of five representative strains were also determined, as well as the effect of metabolites which were produced by these bacteria on yeast growth and fermentation ability. Our results indicate that acetic acid bacteria can occur in high concentrations in the fresh must and during alcoholic fermentation. In the 1998 harvesting season acetic acid bacteria occurred at 106 - 107 cfu per ml in the fresh must. In 1999 these numbers were 104 - 105 cfu/ml. Acetic acid bacteria numbers decreased in 1998 to 102 - 103 cfulml during fermentation. The survival of these bacteria in 1999 correlated with the pH of the must, as well as sulfur dioxide dosages in the must. In must with a low pH and higher sulfur dioxide the number of acetic acid bacterial numbers decreased more drastically than in the high pH, low sulfur dioxide musts. This was also true for acetic acid bacterial counts during cold soaking of musts, with the number of acetic acid bacteria increasing during the cold soaking period in musts with a high pH. In musts with a low pH and higher S 02 dosages acetic acid bacterial counts did not, however, increase during cold soaking. Gluconobacter oxydans dominated in the fresh must with Acetobacter liquefaciens and especially Acetobacter pasteurianus dominating during the fermentation. Different biochemical and physiological tests revealed that 52 % of the 115 isolates tested belong to A. pasteurianus. The high occurrence of A. liquefaciens with A. pasteurianus during fermentation showed that the dominant acetic acid bacterial species in South Africa differed from reports from other wine producing countries. The sulfur dioxide resistance of the acetic acid bacteria tested also differed in white grape juice, with a molecular sulfur dioxide concentration of 0. 64 mg/I being necessary to eliminate all the acetic acid bacterial strains tested. The A. hansenii strain was found to be the most resistant to sulfur dioxide and G. oxydans the least resistant. The latter strain was eliminated by only 0. 05 mg/I molecular sulfur dioxide, while A. hansenii was only eliminated by 0. 64 mg/I molecular sulfur dioxide. The A. pasteurianus, A. liquefaciens and A. aceti strains tested displayed varying degrees of resistance to sulfur dioxide. The volatile acidity produced by these bacteria profoundly influenced the growth and fermentation ability of yeast, which led to slow/stuck fermentation. The A. hansenii and A. pasteurianus strains produced the most volatile acidity in grape juice, with up to 4. 02 g/I for A. hansenii within 4 days, which led to a stuck alcoholic fermentation. This was, however, prevented by inhibiting or eliminating the acetic acid bacteria with sufficient sulfur dioxide additions prior to yeast inoculation. Compounds produced by acetic acid bacteria can also influence wine quality. Certain organic acids were produced and metabolized by acetic acid bacteria, as well as acetoin. We could not, however, detect any other fatty acids that are inhibitory to yeast (produced by these bacteria). This study clearly showed that acetic acid bacteria could occur during fermentation and that certain winemaking techniques, like the maintenance of a low pH in the must and sulfur dioxide additions can influence the growth and survival of acetic acid bacteria. Acetic acid bacteria also influence both the winemaking process by inhibiting yeast as well as the quality of the wine by producing acetic acid and/or other compounds. This study also shed some light on the occurrence of acetic acid bacterial species in the South African context and could be important in assisting the winemaker, as well as the scientific reseacher, in finding ways to inhibit acetic acid bacteria in the ongoing battle against these spoilage microorganisms of wine. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Wynkwaliteit word deur verskillende faktore beinvloed. Dit sluit die druifkwaliteit, wynmaak tegnieke en kwaliteitsbeheer deur die wynmaakproses in. Enige prosesse en faktore wat tot die verlaging in wynkwaliteit kan lei moet dus ten alle koste voorkom word. Die bederf van wyn deur bakterieë kan en is 'n algemene probleem in enige kelder. Bakteriese bederf kan, onder andere, lei tot verhoogte vlugtige suurheid, waarvan 'n sekere konsentrasie limiet in wyn toegelaat word. Asynsuur maak gewoonlik 90 % van die vlugtige suurheid uit. Asynsuur kan deur verskillende gisrasse, heterofermantatiewe melksuurbakterieë en asynsuurbakterieë (wat almal wyn kan bederf) gevorm word. Die vorming van asynsuur in wyn kan dus voorkom word deur die ongewenste groei van dié organismes te voorkom. Asynsuur en ander medium ketting vetsure, soos oktanoë- en dekanoësuur, kan ook tot slepende of gestaakte gistings lei. Suiker wat in die wyn agterbly wat In slepende/gestaakte fermentasie ondergaan kan deur bederf bakterieë gebruik word om die wyn te bederf. Ongedissosieerde asynsuur en ander vetsure dring die gissel binne deur passiewe diffussie en stel 'n proton vry in die sitoplasma wat sitoplasma versuur en sekere ensieme inhibeer. Hierdie sure werk ook sinergisties met etanol en hul inhiberede effek is ook temperatuur afhanklik. Gisrasse verskil in hul weerstandbiedendheid teen asynsuur- en ander mediumketting vetsure en dié vetsure kan ook melksuurbakterieë se groei beïnvloed. Hoe asynsuurbakterieë wyn bederf en die aksies wat geneem kan word om dit te verhoed is in die verlede nie baie ondrsoek nie. Dit is hoofsaaklik daaraan toe te skryf dat geglo is dat die anaerobiese kondisies in wyn en die gebruik van swaweidioksied die groei van asynsuurbakterieë, wat altyd beskryf is as streng aerobe mikroorganismes, kan beheer. Daar is onlangs aangetoon dat asynsuurbakterieë kan oorleef in wyn en selfs die ongunstige kondisies daarin kan oorkom. Hierdie bakterieë is ook in staat om gisgroei en fermentasie vermoë te inhibeer deur die produksie van asynsuur en ander faktore. In Navorsingsprogram om die oorsprong van verhoogde vlugtige suurheid in Suid-Afrikaanse wyne te bepaal is deur die Departement Wingerd- en Wynkunde en die Instituut vir Wynbiotegnologie van die Universiteit van Stellenbosch geinisieer. Dit het ons aangemoedig om die voorkoms van asynsuurbakterieë in Suid-Afrikaanse rooiwyngistings, wat deel vorm van hierdie ondersoek, en ook die dominante asynsuurbakterie rasse te identifiseer. Die swaweidioksied bestandheid van vyf verteenwoordegende rasse en die effek wat metaboliete wat deur dié bakterieë geproduseer is op gisgroei en gisitingsvermoë is bepaal. Ons resultate bewys dat asynsuurbakterieë teen hoë getalle in vars mos en gedurende alkoholiese gisting kan voorkom. Asynsuurbakterieë het gedurende die 1998 seisoen teen 106 - 107 kve/ml en in 1999 teen 104 - 105 kve/ml in die vars mos voorgekom. Gedurende fermentasie het hierdie getalle in die 1998 seisoen gedaal na 102 - 103 kve/ml. Die oorlewing van hierdie bakterieë het gedurende die 1999 seisoen gekorrelleer met die pH en swaweidioksied konsentrasies van die mos. In die lae pH, hoë swaweidioksied moste het asynsuurbakterie getalle vinniger en meer dramaties gedaal as in die hoë pH, lae swaweidioksied moste. Asynsuurbakterie getalle het dieselfde tendens getoon in moste gedurende dopkontak by lae temperature. In moste met 'n hoë pH het asynsuurbakterie getalle toegeneem gedurende koue dopkontak, terwyl dit nie gebeur het nie in moste met 'n lae pH en hoë swaweidioksied konsentrasies. In die vars mos het Gluconobacter oxydans en gedurende die fermentasie Acetobacter liquefaciens en veral Acetobacter pasteurianus oorheers. Verskillende biochemiese en fisiologiese toetse het bepaal dat 52 % van die 115 isolate A. pasteurianus is. Die hoë voorkoms van A. liquefaciens saam met A. pasteurianus gedurende gisting bewys dat die voorkoms en dominansie van asynsuurbakterieë in Suid- Afrika verskil van ander wynproduserende lande. Die swaweidioksied weerstandbiedendheid van die asynsuurbakterieë wat getoets het, het ook verskil, met 0. 64 mg/I molekulêre swaweIdioksied nodig om hul almal te elimineer in wit druiwesap. Die A. hansenii en G. oxydans rasse was die mees weerstandbiedend en sensitiefste onderskeidelik ten opsigte van swaweidioksied. Slegs 0. 05 mg/I molekulêre swaweidioksied was voldoende om G. oxydans te elimineer, terwyl A. hansenii deur 0. 64 mg/I molekulêre swaweidioksied geëlimineer is. Die A. pasteurianus, A. liquefaciens en A. aceti rasse het verskillende swaweidioksied weerstandbiedendheid getoon. Die vlugtige suurheid wat deur dié bakterieë geproduseer is het die groei en gistingvermoë van gis drasties beinvloed, wat tot slepende/gestaakte fermentasies gelei het. Die A. hansenii en A. pasteurianus rasse het die meeste vlugtige suurheid geproduseer, met tot 4. 02 g/I geproduseer deur A. hansenii na vier dae se groei, wat tot 'n gestaakte fermentasie gelei het. Dit is egter voorkom deur die asynsuurbakterieë te elimineer deur genoegsame swaweidioksied toevoegings tot die mos voor gisinokulasie te doen. Verbindings wat deur asynsuurbakterieë geproduseer word kan ook wynkwaliteit beinvloed. Sekere anorganiese sure is deur hierdie bakterieë geproduseer, terwyl ander gemetaboliseer is. Asetoïen is geproduseer deur die getoetse asynsuurbakterieë. Ons kon egter nie ander vetsure wat gis inhibeer opspoor nie. (Geproduseer deur die bakterieë). Hierdie studie bewys dat asynsuurbakterieë gedurende alkoholiese fermentasie kan voorkom en dat sekere wynmaaktegnieke, soos die verkryging van moste met 'n lae pH en genoegsame swaweidioksied toevoegings die groei en oorlewing van asynsuurbakterieë kan beivloed. Asynsuurbakterieë kan ook beide die wynmaakproses, deur giste te inhibeer, en die wynkwaliteit beivloed deur die produksie van asynsuur en/of ander verbindings. Hierdie studie het ook kennis oor die voorkoms van asynsuurbakterieë in Suid-Afrikaanse moste verbeter en kan ook as 'n nuttige hulpmiddel dien vir die wynmaker en navorser in die stryd om hierdie bederf organismes van wyn te elimineer...|$|E

The antioxidant activity and the total phenol index of wood extracts were also evaluated. Results confirmed differences in bacteria and yeast susceptibility to oenological wood extracts among different genera and species. Among them, AAB were especially sensitive to the phenolic inactivation from oenological woods extracts. Contrarily, amongst LAB, L. hilgardii CIAL- 49 was the most resistant strain to the action of the wood extracts. Cherry wood was active against 9 of the 11 strains tested meanwhile French, Rumanian oak wood and chestnut show the lowest values of IC 50 for A. aceti CIAL- 106. No significant correlation was found between antimicrobial activity either with antioxidant activity or with the total phenol content, suggesting that structure-function of the phenolic extracts has a greater influence on the antimicrobial activity than the total phenol content.

40|$|<b>Spoilage</b> <b>of</b> red <b>wine</b> by {{the yeast}} species Dekkera bruxellensis {{is a common}} problem for the global wine industry.

The strains displayed different growth characteristics but were equally capable of producing ethylphenols. On the other hand, significant differences were observed for 18 of the remaining 33 metabolites analysed and duo-trio sensory analysis indicated significant aroma differences between wines inoculated with AWRI 1499 and AWRI 1613. When these wines were spiked with low concentrations of 4 -ethylphenol and 4 -ethylguaiacol, no sensorial differences could be perceived.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Viticulture and Oenology)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. The {{production}} <b>of</b> {{good quality}} <b>wine</b> {{is essential to}} ensure competitiveness on an international level. Wine quality is usually evaluated for the visual, olfactory and taste characteristics <b>of</b> that specific <b>wine.</b> The winemaking process starts with the grapes in the vineyard followed by oenological practises in the winery until the final wine is bottled. Factors that could influence wine quality include the grape quality from which the wine is made and different techniques used during wine production. Other factors include the presence {{as well as the}} interaction between microorganisms found in the grape juice and wine, and the biochemical effect these microorganisms have on certain chemical compounds in the wine. The different microorganisms found in grape juice and wine can either have a negative or positive contribution to the final quality <b>of</b> the <b>wine.</b> During certain stages of the winemaking process the growth and metabolic activity of certain microorganisms is a necessity to produce good wine. During other stages the presence of certain microorganisms can lead to the development of compounds that is regarded as off-flavours and therefore lead to unpalatable <b>wines</b> <b>of</b> low quality. Yeast strains that naturally present on the grapes and in the winery can also contribute to the final quality <b>of</b> the <b>wine.</b> Brettanomyces yeasts are part of the natural flora of winemaking and can drastically influence the aroma characters <b>of</b> a <b>wine</b> through the production of volatile phenols. The general aroma descriptions of volatile phenols include "smoky", "spicy", "barnyard", "animal" and "medicinal". Although some wine drinkers believe that these characters can add to the complexity <b>of</b> a <b>wine,</b> high levels <b>of</b> volatile phenols is mostly regarded as off-flavours and mask the natural fruity flavours <b>of</b> a <b>wine.</b> With this study we wanted to generate {{a better understanding of the}} effect of different winemaking practises on the production of volatile phenols by B. bruxellensis. We evaluated the difference in volatile phenol production when B. bruxellensis was introduced before or after alcoholic fermentation. We have shown that B. bruxellensis could grow and produce volatile phenols during alcoholic fermentation. Results obtained also showed that commercial wine yeast strains could produce the vinyl derivatives that serve as precursors for Brettanomyces yeast to produce the ethyl derivatives. The commercial yeast strains differed in their ability to produce vinyl derivatives. Different malolactic fermentation scenarios were evaluated, namely spontaneous versus inoculated, and with or without yeast lees. Results showed that spontaneous malolactic fermentation had higher volatile phenol levels in the wine than inoculated malolactic fermentation. The treatment with lees reduced the level of volatile phenols, probably due to absorption by yeast cells. The presence of the phenyl acrylic decarboxylase (PAD 1) gene and the production of volatile phenols by S. cerevisiae commercial yeast strains were evaluated in Shiraz grape juice and in synthetic grape juice. The results indicated that the yeast strains differ in their ability to produce 4 -vinylphenol and 4 -vinylguaiacol. All the yeast strains tested had the PAD 1 gene. We also evaluated the presence of the phenolic acid decarboxylase (padA) gene and the ability of different lactic acid bacteria strains to produce volatile phenols in synthetic wine media. Although some of these strains tested positive for the phenolic acid decarboxylase gene most of them only produced very low levels of volatile phenols. This study made a valuable contribution on the knowledge about the effect of Brettanomyces yeast on the volatile phenol content <b>of</b> red <b>wines</b> during different stages of the winemaking process and when applying different winemaking practices. It also showed the effect between Brettanomyces yeast and other wine microorganisms and the possible influence it could have on the final quality <b>of</b> <b>wine.</b> Research such as this can therefore aid the winemaker in making certain decisions when trying to manage Brettanomyces yeast <b>spoilage</b> <b>of</b> <b>wines...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} performed {{during the}} PhD candidature {{was intended to}} evaluate the quality <b>of</b> white <b>wines,</b> {{as a function of}} the reduction in SO 2 use during the first steps of the winemaking process. In order to investigate the mechanism and intensity of interactions occurring between lysozyme and the principal macro-components <b>of</b> musts and <b>wines,</b> a series <b>of</b> experiments on model wine solutions were undertaken, focusing attention on the polyphenols, SO 2, oenological tannins, pectines, ethanol, and sugar components. In the second part of this research program, a series of conventional sulphite added vinifications were compared to vinifications in which sulphur dioxide was replaced by lysozyme and consequently define potential winemaking protocols suitable for the production of SO 2 -free wines. To reach the final goal, the technological performance of two selected yeast strains with a low aptitude to produce SO 2 during fermentation were also evaluated. The data obtained suggested that the addition of lysozyme and oenological tannins during the alcoholic fermentation could represent a promising alternative to the use of sulphur dioxide and a reliable starting point for the production of SO 2 -free wines. The different vinification protocols studied influenced the composition of the volatile profile in wines at the end of the alcoholic fermentation, especially with regards to alcohols and ethyl esters also a consequence of the yeast’s response to the presence or absence of sulphites during fermentation, contributing in different ways to the sensory profiles <b>of</b> <b>wines.</b> In fact, the aminoacids analysis showed that lysozyme can affect the consumption of nitrogen {{as a function of the}} yeast strain used in fermentation. During the bottle storage, the evolution of volatile compounds is affected by the presence of SO 2 and oenological tannins, confirming their positive role in scaveging oxygen and maintaining the amounts of esters over certain levels, avoiding a decline in the wine’s quality. Even though a natural decrease was found on phenolic profiles due to oxidation effects caused by the presence of oxygen dissolved in the medium during the storage period, the presence of SO 2 together with tannins contrasted the decay of phenolic content at the end of the fermentation. Tannins also showed a central role in preserving the polyphenolic profile <b>of</b> <b>wines</b> during the storage period, confirming their antioxidant property, acting as reductants.

40|$|This thesis studies {{metabolites}} in Atlantic salmon (S. salar) {{and their}} effect on the quality and the <b>spoilage</b> <b>of</b> the fish fillets. Of special interest is how the concentrations of metabolites can be assayed using NMR spectroscopy, and how metabolite concentrations {{can be used as}} a measure <b>of</b> quality and <b>spoilage.</b> We have conducted a literature review that reflects the current state of knowledge about metabolites and {{their effect on}} the quality and <b>spoilage</b> <b>of</b> fish fillets. Also some indices that are currently in use, or have been proposed for the measurement of metabolite concentrations, are presented. In our discussion of the literature, we suggest to further study metabolites and a combination of indices for the evaluation of quality, and the state <b>of</b> <b>spoilage</b> <b>of</b> Atlantic salmon fillets. NMR spectroscopy as a method has both advantages and disadvantages for the detection and quantification of metabolites. Even though NMR has its disadvantages, the technique yields large amounts of precise data in a short time, and therefore should be used more frequently in metabolite studies and more generally for the development of indices for quality and <b>spoilage</b> <b>of</b> fish. To further illustrate the point of this conclusion, we present a short case study of Atlantic salmon fillets based on NMR data recorded by Shumilina (2014). We have analyzed this data for some of the metabolites covered in our literature study in order to assess the fillets quality and the state <b>of</b> <b>spoilage.</b> </p...|$|R

Grape {{juice is}} {{transformed}} into wine through the complex processes of alcoholic and malolactic fermentation that is performed by yeasts, lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria. However, the microbes involved in these processes do not only take part in ensuring the successful production <b>of</b> <b>wine,</b> but also cause <b>spoilage</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wine</b> if their growth is not controlled. Conventional, culture-dependent methods of microbiology {{have been used as}} the main technique in detecting and identifying these spoilage microbes. Cultureindependent techniques of molecular biology have recently become more popular in detecting possible spoilage microbes present in must and wine, since it allows the detection and identification of viable, but non-culturable microbes and are not as timeconsuming as conventional microbiological methods. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the sustainability of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis in detecting wine spoilage microbes inoculated into sterile saline solution (SSS) (0. 85 % (m/v) NaCl) and sterile white wine and red wine as single microbial species and as part of mixed microbial populations. Three methods of DNA isolation from SSS, sterile white wine and sterile red wine inoculated with reference microbial strains were compared in terms of DNA concentration and purity, as well as simplicity of the technique. These three DNA isolation methods were the TZ-method, the proteinase K-method and the phenol extraction method. DNA could not successfully be isolated from red <b>wine</b> using any <b>of</b> the three DNA isolation methods. The TZ-method was the method of choice for the isolation of DNA from inoculated SSS and sterile white wine as this technique gave the best results in terms of simplicity, DNA concentration and purity. PCR and DGGE conditions were optimised for the universal primer pair, HDA 1 -GC and HDA 2, the wine-bacteria specific primer pair, WBAC 1 -GC and WBAC 2, and the yeast specific primer pair, NL 1 -GC and LS 2. DNA from Acetobacter pasteurianus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Oenococcus oeni, Brettanomyces bruxellensis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were amplified with the appropriate primers and successfully resolved with DGGE analysis. PCR and DGGE detection limits were successfully determined when 106 cfu. ml- 1 of the reference microbes, A. pasteurianus, Lb. plantarum, Pd. pentosaceus and B. bruxellensis were separately inoculated into SSS and sterile white wine. It was possible to detect low concentrations (101 cfu. ml- 1) with PCR for A. pasteurianus, Lb. plantarum, Grape juice {{is transformed into}} wine through the complex processes of alcoholic and malolactic fermentation that is performed by yeasts, lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria.

It was possible to detect low concentrations (101 cfu. ml- 1) with PCR for A. pasteurianus, Lb. plantarum, iv Pd. pentosaceus, and B. bruxellensis in SSS when amplified with the HDA 1 -GC and HDA 2 primer pair. A PCR detection limit of 102 cfu. ml- 1 was determined in sterile white wine for Pd. pentosaceus and 103 cfu. ml- 1 for B. bruxellensis using this primer pair. The results obtained from the PCR amplification with the WBAC 1 -GC and WBAC 2 primer pair compared well with the results of the HDA 1 -GC and HDA 2 primer pair. The results from the DGGE detection limits indicated that it was possible to detect lower concentrations (101 – 102 cfu. ml- 1) of A. pasteurianus, Lb. plantarum and Pd. pentosaceus with the HDA 1 -GC and HDA 2 primer pair than the WBAC-GC and WBAC 2 primer pair (102 – 104 cfu. ml- 1). Lower detection limits were also determined for B. bruxellensis amplified with the HDA 1 -GC and HDA 2 primer pair (103 – 104 cfu. ml- 1) than with the NL 1 -GC and LS 2 primer pair (105 cfu. ml- 1). PCR and DGGE detection limits for the inoculation of A. pasteurianus, Lb. plantarum and B. bruxellensis at an inoculum of 108 cfu. ml- 1 as part of mixed populations in SSS and sterile white wine compared well with the results obtained from the reference microbes inoculated as single microbial species. PCR detection limits of 101 cfu. ml- 1 were determined for all three reference microbes inoculated as part of mixed populations when amplified with the HDA 1 -GC and HDA 2 and the WBAC 1 -GC and WBAC 2 primer pairs. It was observed that similar or higher DGGE detection limits were obtained for the reference microbes inoculated in sterile white wine (101 – 107 cfu. ml- 1) than when inoculated into SSS (101 – 105 cfu. ml- 1). PCR-based DGGE analysis proved to be a technique that could be used successfully with the universal, wine-bacteria and yeast specific primer pairs for the detection of A. pasteurianus, Lb. plantarum, Pd. pentosaceus and B. bruxellensis.
