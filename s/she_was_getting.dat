5|$|Boyd had {{her first}} {{encounter}} with LSD in early 1965 when the couple's dentist, John Riley, secretly laced her coffee with the drug during a dinner party at his home. As <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> ready to leave with Harrison and John and Cynthia Lennon, Riley told them that he had spiked their drinks and tried to persuade them to stay. Outside, Boyd was in an agitated state from the drug and threatened to break a store window, but Harrison pulled her away. Later, when Boyd and her group were in a lift on their {{way up to the}} Ad Lib club, they mistakenly believed it was on fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} had proceeded despite opposition from her parents, who worried about Pound's meager income, earned from contributions to literary magazines and probably less than £300 a year. Dorothy's annual income was £50, aided by £150 from her family. Her parents eventually consented, perhaps {{out of fear}} that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> older with no other suitor in sight. Pound's concession to marry in church helped convince them. Afterward he and Dorothy moved into an apartment with no bathroom at 5 Holland Place Chambers, Kensington, with the newly wed Hilda (H.D.) and Richard Aldington living next door.|$|E

5|$|Tubman {{served as}} a nurse in Port Royal, {{preparing}} remedies from local plants and aiding soldiers suffering from dysentery. She rendered assistance to men with smallpox; {{that she did not}} contract the disease herself started more rumors that she was blessed by God. At first, she received government rations for her work, but newly freed blacks thought <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> special treatment. To ease the tension, she gave up her right to these supplies and made money selling pies and root beer, which she made in the evenings.|$|E

By order of Prosecutor-General Tor-Aksel Busch, {{both men were}} charged with {{identical}} crimes of rape and premeditated murder.

25|$|Act Two {{begins with}} fitness queen, Brooke Wyndham, and her fitness team's workout video, {{which is being}} viewed by Elle, Callahan, Emmett, Vivienne, Warner, and Enid ("Whipped Into Shape"). Callahan tells the legal team that Brooke is accused of murdering her billionaire husband. At the jail, the legal team are unable to get Brooke to tell them her alibi and refuses to plead guilty. Upon {{learning}} that they were both Delta Nu sisters, Brooke then privately tells Elle her alibi that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> liposuction, but makes Elle promise not to tell anyone ("Delta Nu Nu Nu"). Because of Elle's loyalty to her client and refusal to state the alibi, Elle and Emmett are shunned by the group. To cheer Emmett up and to increase his chances of impressing Callahan, Elle gives him a makeover ("Take It Like A Man").|$|E
25|$|At age nine, Mitchell {{contracted}} polio in an epidemic, and was hospitalised for weeks. No longer athletic, {{she turned}} her thoughts to her creative talent, and considered a singing or dancing career for the first time. By nine, she was a smoker; she denies claims that smoking has affected her voice. At 11, she moved with her family {{to the city of}} Saskatoon, which she considers her hometown. She responded badly to formal education, preferring a freethinking outlook, and was drawn to art, a pursuit often regarded as peripheral at the time. One unconventional teacher did manage to make an impact on her, stimulating her to write poetry, and her first album includes a dedication to him. In twelfth grade, she flunked out (though she later picked up her studies) and hung out downtown with a rowdy set until deciding that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> too close to the criminal world.|$|E

25|$|However, Evan Whitton, a noted {{journalist}} and campaigner against organised crime, claims that in May 1977 Richardson's wife, Cheryl, {{went on the}} payroll, at approximately $130 a week, of Casey's Balmain Welding, but {{did not have to}} attend at the office. Richardson later told the Woodward Royal Commission, it was the policy of the company not to hire office staff, so they sent the typing out to Mrs Richardson. She kept the job until about May 1979, by which time <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> about $160 a week from Balmain Welding. Richardson's links with Casey were brought to public notice through the reconvening of the Woodward Royal Commission in 1980 due to allegations that Casey had funnelled $20,000, alleged to be a product of gambling and drugs, into NSW Labor. Richardson told the Commission on 28 March 1980 that Casey had not donated $20,000 to the Party, and the Commission found no evidence against Casey.|$|E
500|$|Advised of her failing health, Bishop Ignace Bourget visited Cadron-Jetté on April 4, 1864, and {{administered}} {{to her the}} last rites. Rosalie Cadron-Jetté died shortly thereafter, during {{the early hours of}} April 5, 1864. Her death was witnessed by Sister Marie-des-Saints-Anges, who said this of the occasion: [...] "I witnessed her blessed death. I was sitting vigil with our good sister Sainte-Béatrix. Around 2 a.m. she made {{the sign of the cross}} and asked us to recite the Litanies of the Virgin Mary; then she arranged herself as if to prepare for sleep, then in a high pitched voice she said: O my Jesus!

Not just sexual, I just mean whatever—open your mouth. That's empowering to me. That's what the song is about." [...] In an interview with Perez Hilton, Hilson said that she cannot allow other people or the media to dictate what she can and what cannot do. She also dismissed the negative reviews, because she knew some women were [...] "empowered" [...] by its message. She added that listeners have to be fearless and stand for what they believe in and concluded by saying that [...] "The Way You Love Me" [...] is not meant for children.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was a {{surprise}} to me," [...] said the woman, [...] "but she told me this morning <b>she's</b> <b>been</b> <b>getting</b> ready on the quiet for the last fortnight. Good spirits <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in, too; laughing like anything." ...|$|R

500|$|The Beauty Process also {{contains}} heavier songs that {{are reminiscent of}} the band's previous albums. The song [...] "Drama" [...] features a guitar solo played with a Micro Jammers' toy guitar. Sparks explained that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> frustrated with it, commenting [...] "Fuck it, I can't play these riffs, let the Micro Jammers do it for $1.99." [...] The song was described by Spin as [...] " [...] off like Helmet sans pretentious time signatures". The track [...] "Bad Things" [...] was described as [...] "a full-throttle blast of urban paranoia", while [...] "The Masses Are Asses" [...] deals with social outrage and rude humor. The album's title refers to two different things: the first part, [...] "The Beauty Process", is what Sparks would call [...] "putting my fright makeup on before a show", while the second part, [...] "Triple Platinum", is a joke about L7's career as the band had yet to reach gold status.|$|E
500|$|Megan {{decides that}} the only way to confront Colin is to accept her mother's invitation, which she had {{previously}} declined, as Colin is attending and after questioning him, she rules him out as a suspect. Curtis confirms that the maggots that he was testing take around two days to mature, so Curtis confirms that Daphne was dead for two days before the body was found.

It was a story about the women in her sorority whom she admired, with a subplot consisting of two sorority sisters who {{had fallen in love with}} each other. Carroll told her to take it back and focus on the two characters who had an affair. Bannon claims she went back and told their story, delivered the draft to Carroll and saw it published without a single word changed. While raising two young children, Bannon lived in Philadelphia and took trips into New York City to visit Greenwich Village and stayed with friends. She said of the women she saw in Greenwich Village, [...] "I wanted to be one of them, to speak to other women, if only in print. And so I made a beginning—and that beginning was the story that became Odd Girl Out." ...|$|E
500|$|Rathbun {{was arrested}} on three occasions, with each arrest {{bringing}} increased local, national, and international media attention to the medical cannabis movement.

Would you be interested in trying to do some research to show whether she was doing something that might actually have been helpful to these patients? She probably thought that it was helpful since, you know, she was permitted on the ward to do this. And so I spoke to a Dr. Donald Abrams {{and he said that he}} would be interested in trying to do research in this area, and so we started to collaborate"; Sheehy, 2000: [...] "According to Donald Abrams, MD, lead author of the study and professor of clinical medicine in the UCSF Positive Health Program at San Francisco General Hospital Medical Center, this was the first attempt to study the effects of marijuana in people with HIV and one of the most comprehensive studies about the effects of marijuana on the immune system." ...|$|E
