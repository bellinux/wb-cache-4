50|$|<b>Sulfiram</b> is {{structurally}} {{related to}} disulfiram (Antabuse), and readily converts to disulfiram {{when exposed to}} light. Like disulfiram, it can produce an unpleasant reaction when consumed with alcohol.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the events}} {{associated}} with Alzheimer’s disease is the dysregulation of a- versus b-cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). The product of a-cleavage (sAPPa) has neuroprotective properties, while Ab 1 - 42 peptide, a product of b-cleavage, is neurotoxic. Dimerization of APP {{has been shown to}} influence the relative rate of a- and b- cleavage of APP. Thus finding compounds that interfere with dimerization of the APP ectodomain and increase the a-cleavage of APP could lead to the development of new therapies for Alzheimer’s disease. Examining the intrinsic fluorescence of a fragment of the ectodomain of APP, which dimerizes through the E 2 and Ab-cognate domains, revealed significant changes in the fluorescence of the fragment upon binding of Ab oligomers—which bind to dimers of the ectodomain — and Ab fragments—which destabilize dimers of the ectodomain. This technique was extended to show that RERMS-containing peptides (APP 695 328 – 332), disulfiram, and <b>sulfiram</b> also inhibit dimerization of the ectodomain fragment. This activity was confirmed with small angle x-ray scattering. Analysis of the activity of disulfiram and <b>sulfiram</b> in an AlphaLISA assay indicated that both compounds significantly enhance the production of sAPPa by 7 W-CHO and B 103 neuroblastoma cells. These observations demonstrate that there is a class of compounds that modulates the conformation of the APP ectodomain and influences the ratio of a- to b-cleavage of APP. These compounds provide a rationale {{for the development of a}} new class of therapeutics for Alzheimer’s disease...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Disulfiram {{remains a}} viable option as a {{treatment}} for alcohol dependence and has been shown in recent studies to be successful in treating patients with alco- hol dependence {{in a manner that is}} superior to both naltrexone and acamprosate. It is also useful in dual diagnosis patients and those with co-morbid cocaine and alcohol dependence. Although disulfiram’s me- chanism of action in alcohol dependence was long thought to be its effects as a psychological deterrent, more recent studies have uncovered potential anti- craving effects as well. Recent reviews exhort to the importance of supervised disulfiram therapy in high- lighting many of the potential and unique benefits of disulfiram. The present article will review the major clinical trials of disulfiram spanning nearly 60 years. It also discusses the usage of disulfiram across diverse populations along with monitoring for compliance and various adverse effects that may be encountered. The paper also reviews certain studies on long acting di- <b>sulfiram</b> therapy, recent comparative trials of disul- firam and its use in alcohol dependence. The review concludes with the role of disulfiram in the present day and long-term pharmacotherapy of alcohol de- pendence along with future research needs in this area.
