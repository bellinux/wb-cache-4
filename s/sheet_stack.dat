During the Alpine orogenic event of Cretaceous age, the Vepor Unit was first buried during the northward overthrusting of the Gemer Unit and later exhumed during the eastward lateral escape of the Gemer.

The welding current, the electrode tip voltage and the electrical resistance of <b>sheet</b> <b>stack</b> were monitored in order to detect any metal expulsion and to evaluate its severity, as well as to clarify its effect on spot strength. The joint strength was assessed by means of shear and cross tension tests. The corresponding fracture modes were determined through optical microscopy. The welding current is the main process parameter that affects the weld strength, followed by the clamping force and welding time. Metal expulsion can occur through a single large expulsion or multiple expulsions, whose effects on the shear and cross tension strength have been assessed. Longer welding times can limit the negative effect of an expulsion if it occurs {{in the first part of}} the joining process. The spot welds exhibit different fracture modes according to their strengths.

These fibers can be considered as prototypes for advanced high strength/high-stiffness fibers like Kevlar, Twaron, New Star, etc. While modeling these fibers, it was taken into account that they are essentially crystalline materials consisting of <b>stacks</b> of <b>sheets,</b> with each sheet containing an array of nearly parallel hydrogen-bonded molecules/chains. The inter-sheet bonding, on the other hand, was considered as mainly being of van der Waals or p-electron character.

The results obtained show that while the presence of these defects decreases all the mechanical properties of PPTA fibers, specific properties display an increased level of sensitivity to the presence of certain defects.
