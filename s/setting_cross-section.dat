40|$|Radio {{synchrotron}} emission is expected {{as a natural}} by-product of the self-annihilation of super-symmetric dark matter particles. In this work we discuss the general properties of the radio emission expected {{in a wide range}} of dark matter halos, from local dwarf spheroidal galaxies to large and distant galaxy clusters with the aim to determine the neutralino dark matter detection prospects of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). The analysis of the SKA detection of dark matter(DM) -induced radio emission is presented for structures spanning a wide range of masses and redshifts, and we also analyze the limits that the SKA can set on the thermally averaged neutralino annihilation cross-section in the event of non-detection. To this aim, we construct a model of the redshift evolution of the radio emissions of dark matter halos and apply it to generate predicted fluxes from a range of neutralino masses and annihilation channels for the dark matter halos surrounding dwarf galaxies, galaxies and galaxy clusters. Using the available SKA performance predictions and its ability to determine an independent measure of the magnetic field in cosmic structures, we explore both the detailed detection prospects and the upper-bounds that might be placed on the neutralino annihilation cross-section in the event of non-detection. We find that the SKA can access a neutralino parameter space far larger than that of any preceding indirect-detection experiment, also improving on the realistic CTA detection prospects, with the possibility of <b>setting</b> <b>cross-section</b> upper-bounds up to four orders of magnitude below the thermal relic density bound. Additionally, we find that neutralino radio emissions carry redshift-independent signatures of the dominant annihilation channel and of neutralino mass, offering therefore a means to identify such non-thermal emissions within the observing frequency range of the SKA.

40|$|POSMOL 2015, 17 - 20 July 2015, Lisboa, Portugal; [URL] {{determination}} {{of a comprehensive}} <b>set</b> of electron-biomolecule <b>cross-sections</b> is fundamental to understanding electron induced processes arising in plasma medicine and radiation damage modelling. Formulation of complete sets is generally based on a critical assessment of available experimental `beam' studies and theoretical calculations, and interpolations/extropolations. Issues of completeness and accuracy of <b>cross-section</b> <b>sets</b> arise and {{it is here that}} swarm experiments play a key role. Here, excess electrons under the action of an applied electric field are passed through a gas of biomolecules and measured currents are interpreted in terms of transport coefficients such as drift velocities, diffusion coefficients, and ionization/attachment rates. Through comparison of measured transport coefficients with those calculated from transport theory/ simulation, one can assess the ability of the <b>cross-section</b> <b>set</b> to accurately treat particle, momentum, and energy balance. In this presentation we report on recent swarm measurements in the biomolecules of water and tetrahydrafuran (THF) using the pulsed-Townsend technique of the de Urquijo group. We present and assess the consistency of <b>cross-section</b> <b>sets</b> for water and THF through a comparison of calculated transport coefficients using a multi-term Boltzmann equation solution with the available experimental swarm measurements provides a discriminating test on consistency and accuracy of the cross-section. Cross-section degeneracy (i. e., different <b>sets</b> of <b>cross-sections</b> can produce the same field dependence of the transport coefficients) is an issue. Additional handles to assess the degeneracy, accuracy and completeness of the <b>cross-section</b> <b>set</b> can be through measurements in admixtures with well known cross-sections which can considerably modify the distribution function. To this end, results for water/He, water/Ar and THF/N 2 mixtures will be presented. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|In this {{document}} we list the experimental data {{that were used}} to make up the major cross- section sets that we use in the Watusi code to calculate the amount of detector activation in device tests. In order to use experimental data to make up a <b>cross-section</b> <b>set,</b> it is often necessary to extrapolate the cross sections down to either the threshold energy or to 0. 01 keV, and to extrapolate up to 20 MeV. We then fit the data to a function {{so that we can get}} a smoothed set of interpolated values at up to 321 energy points. The combined data are then processed with the Hiroshima code into flux-weighted, group-averaged cross sections for use with the output from the different physics design codes. We typically use the standard 53 or 175 energy group structures. In a recent companion memo 1 we described the make up of all of the <b>cross-section</b> <b>sets</b> in detail, giving references to both the experimental data and the theoretical calculations that were used. The following sections have the experimental data, in the form of energy-cross section pairs, for the titanium, chromium, bromine, krypton, yttrium, zirconium, iodine, europium, lutetium, and bismuth <b>sets.</b> The other <b>cross-section</b> <b>sets</b> are not directly based on enough experimental data to warrant their listing here. Many of the reactions used in these sets are based on calculated cross sections. In making these calculations certain parameters are sometimes adjusted so that the calculated cross sections match experimental data. In some of these cases we have made a further normalization to give a closer agreement to selected experimental data, and such normalizations are noted in {{this document}}. In other cases no further normalization was made. In Table 1 we summarize the reactions for which we present the experimental data given in Tables 2 - 46.
