So, we can’t be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a reference to the state of affairs during the Cao Wei (220-265), or whether it refers to the situation before the civil war during the Later Han when China lost touch with most foreign countries and came to be divided into three separate kingdoms.|$|E
25|$|Animals {{have been}} known to {{perceive}} the infrasonic waves going through the earth by natural disasters and can use these as an early warning. A recent example of this is the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Animals were reported to flee the area hours before the actual tsunami hit the shores of Asia. It is not known for <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the cause; some have suggested that {{it may have been the}} influence of electromagnetic waves, and not of infrasonic waves, that prompted these animals to flee.|$|E

'Now I think,' said Mr Pecksniff {{with his}} {{accustomed}} gentleness, though {{still with the}} air of one who suffered under injury without complaint, 'I think Mr Pinch might have done better than choose for his companion one who, {{at the close of}} a long intercourse, had endeavoured, as he knew, to wound my feelings.

2500|$|Heliodor Píka was hanged in {{the yard}} of Bory Prison (...) in Plzeň around 06:00 {{on the morning of}} June 21, 1949. In a {{farewell}} letter to his family, written the night before his execution, he wrote: [...] "I am <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not a judicial error but a political murder". Offered the chance to express his last wishes as he stood at the gallows, he said: [...] "my ultimate desire is that the nation remain united, and that everyone, without regard for their differences, work toward the unity of our people". He was the first of more than 200 Czechoslovaks tried and executed for political reasons by the communist government of Czechoslovakia. His body was never found.|$|E
2500|$|Following the lynching on October 16, 2000, Riccardo Cristiano, {{the deputy}} {{head of the}} Jerusalem bureau of Italy's state {{television}} channel RAI, published a letter (...) in Al-Hayat al-Jadida, the official daily newspaper of the Palestinian Authority (PA). In the letter (entitled [...] "Special Clarification by the Italian Representative of RAI, the Official Italian Television Station"), Cristiano denies that RAI had any involvement with the filming of the incident {{and that one of}} the station's Italian competitors was responsible for the footage. He wrote, [...] "We [...] emphasize to all of you that the events did not happen this way, because we always respect (will continue to respect) the journalistic procedures with the Palestinian Authority for (journalistic) work in Palestine and we are credible in our precise work." [...] The Italian correspondent also praised the PA, declaring, [...] "We congratulate you [...] and think that it is our duty to put you in the picture (of the events) of what happened on October 12 in Ramallah.... We thank you for your trust, and you can be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not our way of acting. We do not (will not) do such a thing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "This reminds me," [...] the {{professor}} declared, [...] "of the old days. I feel <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{going to be}} a thoroughly enjoyable evening.

6000|$|... "He {{was last}} seen {{on the night of}} May 13th--that is, the night of last Monday. His room was on the second floor and was {{approached}} through another larger room, in which two boys were sleeping. These boys saw and heard nothing, so that it is certain that young Saltire did not pass out that way. His window was open, and there is a stout ivy plant leading to the ground. We could trace no footmarks below, but it is <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the only possible exit.|$|E
60|$|The guide {{goes down}} again, and convoys into the lair {{a person in}} blue {{overalls}} carrying an amount of inebriety and a lantern.

6000|$|He {{turned back}} to the hotel, walking a little unsteadily. All the time he <b>was</b> not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> not a dream.

60|$|Mr. Newcombe {{now stood}} by, and Dickory also.

6000|$|Wrayson {{laid down}} the telephone. Morris Barnes had come from South Africa.

60|$|I say savage, but I am not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a right {{description}} of Rezu. Evidently {{he had a}} religion of a sort, also imagination, as was shown by the theft of the white woman to be his queen; by his veiling of her to resemble Ayesha whom he dreaded; by the intended propitiatory sacrifice; by the guard of women sworn to her service who slew the priest that tried to kill her, and afterwards committed suicide when they had failed in their office, and by other things. All this indicated something more than savagery, perhaps survivals from a forgotten civilisation, or perhaps native ability {{on the part of}} an individual ruler. I do not know and it matters nothing.|$|E
6000|$|He {{returned}} to the desk. [...] "Let us make quite <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> all," [...] he said, and held the taper so that the light shone into the recess. It seemed empty at first; then, as the light penetrated farther, he saw something that showed white {{at the back of}} the cachette. He thrust in his hand, and drew out a small package bound with a ribbon that once might have been green but was faded now to yellow. He set it on the desk, and {{returned to}} his search. There was nothing else. The recess was empty. He closed the trap and replaced the drawer. Then he sat down again, the taper at his elbow, Mistress Winthrop looking on, facing him across the top of the secretaire, and he took up the package.|$|E
60|$|But {{what is the}} {{so strong}} {{evidence}} of the actual identity of these places? What is it that makes me so <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the Mount of Olives, and that water-channel there the brook Cedron, and the hamlet {{on the other side}} the veritable Bethany? Why is one to be so sure of these, and yet feel such an infinity of doubt as to that village of Emmaus, that valley of Ajalon, that supposed Arimathea, and the rest of them? Nay, I cannot well say, at any rate not in these light novel pages. Dr. Stanley, with considerable distinctness does say. But go and see: with the ordinary Protestant Christian seeing here will be believing, as seeing over in that church of the holy places most indisputably will be disbelieving.|$|E
60|$|I endeavoured to {{say that}} I knew he was far more capable than I of {{deciding}} {{what we ought to}} do, but <b>was</b> he <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> right?

60|$|Feeling {{moderately}} <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> {{the animal}} his uncle had seen, {{and that the}} deer would not go far, but might even come back out of curiosity, Earl began to climb the cliff.

6000|$|... "One {{evening at}} {{twilight}} I was making {{my way through}} a teakwood forest, when I came upon a deep circular depression in an open space, in the centre {{of which was a}} rude stone temple.

6000|$|Miss Headworth, {{he could}} not deny, had aged, but far less than Mrs. Nugent in the past year, and {{it really was a}} great comfort to Miss Mary to have the old ladies together. He told too how the mission, now lately over, had stirred the Micklethwayte folk into strong excitement, and how good works had been undertaken, evil habits renounced, {{reconciliations}} effected, religious services frequented. Would it last? Nobody, he said, had taken it up so zealously as Gerard Godfrey, who seemed as if he would fain throw everything up, and spend his whole life in some direct service as a home missionary or something of the kind. 'He is a good fellow,' said Mr. Dutton, 'and it is quite genuine, but I made him wait at least a year, that he may be <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not only a passing impulse.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... [35] I ought here, however, to {{have noted}} another {{effect of the}} [...] rain-cloud, which, so far as I know, has been {{rendered}} only by [...] Copley Fielding. It is seen chiefly in clouds gathering for rain, [...] when the sky is entirely covered with a gray veil rippled or waved [...] with pendent swells of soft texture, but excessively hard and liny [...] in their edges. I am not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> an agreeable or [...] impressive form of the rain-cloud, {{but it is a}} frequent one, and it [...] is often most faithfully given by Fielding; only in some cases the [...] edges becoming a little doubled and harsh have given a look of [...] failure or misadventure to some even of the best studied passages; [...] and something of the same hardness of line is occasionally visible [...] in his drawing of clouds by whose nature it is not warranted.|$|E
60|$|I {{warn you}} that if you attempt to {{repudiate}} your responsibility, I shall suspect you of finding the play too decorous for your taste. The fifteen years have made me older and graver. In you I can detect no such becoming change. Your levities and audacities are like the loves and comforts prayed for by Desdemona: they increase, even as your days do grow. No mere pioneering journal dares meddle with them now: the stately Times itself is alone sufficiently above suspicion to act as your chaperone; and even the Times must sometimes thank its stars that new plays are not produced every day, since after each such event its gravity is compromised, its platitude turned to epigram, its portentousness to wit, its propriety to elegance, and even its decorum into naughtiness by criticisms which the traditions of the paper do not allow you to sign at the end, but which you take care to sign with the most extravagant flourishes between the lines. I am not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not a portent of Revolution. In eighteenth century France the end was at hand when men bought the Encyclopedia and found Diderot there. When I buy the Times and find you there, my prophetic ear catches a rattle of twentieth century tumbrils.|$|E
25|$|According to Tawfiq bin Attash, Omari {{was one of}} a {{group of}} future hijackers who {{provided}} security at Kandahar airport after their basic training at an al-Qaeda camp.

6000|$|Rosa {{laughed at}} the idea of being in debt. It seemed, to her inexperience, a comical vagary of the imagination. Mr. Grewgious {{stretched}} his near sight to <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> her view of the case. ‘Ah!’ he said, as comment, with a furtive glance towards Miss Twinkleton, and lining out pounds, shillings, and pence: ‘I spoke of having got among the angels!

60|$|Ormsgill <b>was</b> {{far from}} <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> what he desired, {{but he knew}} his man, and that, for all his {{apparent}} inconsequence, he was one who when the pinch came could be relied upon.
