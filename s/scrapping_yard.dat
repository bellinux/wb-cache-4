30|$|<b>Scrap</b> <b>yards</b> are {{potentially}} PCB-contaminated areas [113]. Highest contamination {{can be expected}} for sites used to store PCB equipment. However, “normal” <b>scrap</b> <b>yards</b> are also impacted to some extent by PCB-contaminated scrap. In the German study, one beef herd was contaminated by PCBs transferred from the former <b>scrap</b> <b>yard</b> by horse dung stored at the site, leading to PCB contamination of the pasture land and the cattle [17].|$|R
30|$|The total {{suspended}} solid {{was found to}} ranged from 228 to 689 and 237 to 490  mg/L for Owode-Onirin <b>scrap</b> <b>yard</b> and Lafenwa <b>scrap</b> <b>yard</b> neighbourhood respectively with Owode-Onirin <b>scrap</b> <b>yard</b> higher than Lafenwa <b>scrap</b> <b>yard</b> neighbourhood. While a direct correlation can be established in Owode-Onirin scrap 8 and 2 for Chloride (157 and 139  mg/L) and EC with (1378 and 1230  μS/cm) respectively which high chloride values for Lafenwa <b>scrap</b> <b>yard</b> neighbourhood do not show these trend hence the variation in the mean values varied significantly amongst the samples as the values obtained were different which {{may be attributed to}} further infiltration of salt along the coastal line. The values of hardness also show a direct relationship with the concentration of Chloride with the same Owode-Onirin <b>scrap</b> <b>yard</b> having higher concentration, Chloride ions are non-cumulative toxins, an excess amount of which, if taken over a period of time, can constitute a health hazard. It is believed that higher concentration of chloride ions may result in taste problems and higher level of chloride is known to impart taste to water particularly when sodium is the predominant cation (APHA 2005). Though, stronger relationship is exhibited in the values of chloride and hardness in Lafenwa <b>scrap</b> <b>yard</b> neighbourhood 5, 3 and 4 in that order of magnitude and the values were all above the WHO (2011) standard. Nitrate and potassium were also found to be higher in the same three site of the Lafenwa <b>scrap</b> <b>yard</b> neighbourhood well above the WHO (2011) stipulated standard, increases in nitrate values could be attributed to their utilization by micro organisms for growth and reproduction along the <b>scrap</b> <b>yard</b> (Prescott et al. 1999), high level of sodium can also lead to a high Na/K and Na/total cation ratio which may be of great concern from the perspective of human pathology (NRC 1989; APHA 2005). Although the increased in sodium other micro nutrient fall within the permissible limit and hence posses no threat to the environment.|$|R

30|$|This {{study showed}} the {{potential}} discharge of various hazardous heavy metals {{in the water}} body through seepage in Owode-Onirin, Ikorodu area of Lagos Sate and Lafenwa <b>scrap</b> <b>yard,</b> Abeokuta, Ogun State due to uncontrolled activities of <b>scrap</b> <b>yards.</b> The {{results showed that the}} physicochemical parameters and of heavy metals concentration in surface water from most of sampling locations exceeded permissible limits set by Standard Organization of Nigeria drinking water specifications standard (SON 2007) and WHO (2004) for drinking water. Variations in concentrations of these various heavy metals in water sampled are a consequence {{of a wide range of}} <b>scrap</b> <b>yard</b> activities within the neighbourhood.|$|R
30|$|Conductivity values {{express the}} amount of {{dissolved}} solids in the water sample. Water from Owode-Onirin <b>scrap</b> <b>yard</b> and Lafenwa <b>scrap</b> <b>yard</b> neighbourhood has conductivity values that ranged from 456 to 1378 and 460 to 980  μS/cm respectively. Conductivity of the water samples was above the stipulated value of 1000  μS/cm by WHO and NAFDAC. Although may be high with attended increase in value over time. The observed data of electrical conductivity followed similar pattern as pH. It was observed that EC value increased in the contaminated water and this revealed the positive impact of <b>scrap</b> <b>yard</b> on contaminated water EC. High EC can affect the microbial activities in soil (USDA-NRCS 2014).|$|R
