Hal ini dikarenakan semua negara membuka pasar bagi masuknya produk impor minimal 5 % dari konsumsi yang dibutuhkan. Produk dalam negeri dituntut mampu bersaing dengan produk impor baik dari segi kualitas, kuantitas dan kontinuitasnya. Jenis ternak dan produk kambing / domba mulai dikembangkan untuk memenuhi permintaan pasar. Berdasarkan peluang perdagangan pasar  global, kambing merupakan komoditas unggulan untuk dipacu  perkembangan populasi, sebagai ternak ekspor. Berdasarkan permasalahan tersebut maka, tujuan tulisan ini adalah untuk mengulas beberapa prospek dan strategi perdagangan ternak kambing dalam upaya merebut peluang pasar duniayang menguntungkan bagi pendapatan devisa negara. Jenis impor ternak sapi, kambing dan domba dalam kurun waktu 2008 - 2012, namun secara umum terjadi kenaikan pada impor sapi hidup. Impor daging sapi cenderung menurun, impor kambing/domba hidup dan daging cenderung stabil. Keadaan tersebut mengindikasikan defisit dalam negeri meningkat. Guna mengatasi hal ini maka perlu ada wacana yang bersifat horisontal di perdagangan pasar dunia, dimana pasar tidak memonopili terhadap produk ekspor.

5|$|The Giro's 21 stages {{were divided}} into the {{following}} classifications by race organizers Gazzetta dello Sport: four time trials (three individual and one team), seven flat stages, five mixed stages, and six mountain stages. The race began in the Netherlands, the ninth time in the Giro's history that the race began outside Italy, and the first since 2006's start in Belgium. A short individual time trial and two flat stages were held there. Starting the race away from Italy meant that an early rest day, coming just three days into the 23-day race, was necessary to transfer to Italy. The first stage upon entering Italy was a team time trial, the fifth consecutive year that discipline had featured in the Giro. Stage 7 visited Tuscany and was raced partly on unpaved roads used yearly in the Italian semi-classic Montepaschi <b>Strade</b> Bianche. The course honored Italian cycling legends Gino Bartali, Fausto Coppi, and Costante Girardengo by passing through their hometowns in the first road race stages in Italy.|$|E

The team's first race win of the season came at <b>Strade</b> Bianche when Michał Kwiatkowski took a solo victory after attacking 15 kilometers from the finish. Geraint Thomas took a stage win at Tirreno-Adriatico and held the leader's jersey for one day, also taking the overall victory and one stage win at the Tour of the Alps. Sky won Paris-Nice {{for the fifth time}} in sixth years courtesy of Sergio Henao, who won the race overall by just two seconds over Alberto Contador. Kwiatkowski added to Sky's win total by winning Milan-San Remo in a three-up sprint, giving the team its second Monument win. Neo-pro Jonathan Dibben won the individual time trial stage at the Tour of California, the team also winning the team classification with Tao Geoghegan Hart and Ian Boswell placing in the final top ten overall.|$|E
25|$|Sagan {{started his}} {{season at the}} Tour de San Luis, taking his first podium place of the year on Stage 2 by {{finishing}} second. In February, after a three-week training camp in Spain's Sierra Nevada, he competed in the opening races of the Belgian classics season, finishing second in Omloop Het Nieuwsblad and seventh in Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne. He then came in fourth at the <b>Strade</b> Bianche, {{being part of the}} four-man decisive move, but getting dropped on the final climb to Siena. He took part in Tirreno–Adriatico, where he finished second in the overall classification, a single second behind Greg van Avermaet. This edition of the race was different in character from other recent editions since the only mountainous stage had been cancelled due to snow. Sagan also won the points classification jersey. Sagan claimed his eighth second-place finish without a win since the World Championship at the Belgian road cycling classic E3 Harelbeke, before taking his first win as a world champion in Gent-Wevelgem, becoming the first reigning world champion to win the race since Rik Van Looy in 1962. Upon his win at Gent-Wevelgem Sagan became the World No.1 in the newly formed rankings.|$|E
500|$|The {{outgoing}} champion, John Degenkolb, missed Milan–San Remo after injuries {{sustained in}} an early-season {{training camp in}} Spain. In his absence, 2014 winner Alexander Kristoff (...) was tipped as the main favourite for the victory. Fabian Cancellara (...) was also rated highly in what would be his final appearance in the race, as {{he was a former}} winner and had shown strong form, winning <b>Strade</b> Bianche earlier in the season. World Champion Peter Sagan (...) was also named as a race favourite, as he had shown good form, albeit still lacking a win in 2016. He rode with bib number one in the absence of Degenkolb.|$|E
500|$|The 2015 champion, 's Geraint Thomas, was {{not present}} to defend his title; he was riding the 2016 Volta a Catalunya instead.

Cancellara was riding the race for the final time, having announced that the 2016 season would be his last as a professional, and was in strong form with victories in the <b>Strade</b> Bianche and a time-trial stage of the 2016 Tirreno–Adriatico. Sagan, the reigning world champion, had also been performing strongly, but did not have any victories so far in 2016. Boonen had not demonstrated any strong form.|$|E
500|$|The {{principal}} favourites for {{the race}} were Tom Boonen (...) and Fabian Cancellara (...) , both of whom had won the race on three previous occasions. Cancellara was in strong form, having won the <b>Strade</b> Bianche and having come fourth in E3 Harelbeke and Gent–Wevelgem the previous week. Boonen, however, was not in strong form: he had not won a major classic since 2012 and had not performed strongly in the previous week's races. Nevertheless, Cycling Weekly wrote [...] "you can never write the three-time Flanders winner off in a race like this." [...] The other former winners present at the start were Alexander Kristoff (...) , the defending champion, and Cancellara's teammate Stijn Devolder. Kristoff's strong sprint gave him an advantage {{if he was in}} a group that finished together; he had, however, been ill in the previous week. Devolder, meanwhile, was expected to work for Cancellara.|$|E
500|$|Kwiatkowski's {{victory was}} his first since joining Team Sky at the {{beginning}} of 2016. He said after the race that his main target was still the Ardennes classics rather than the remainder of the cobbled classics season, but that there was no reason why he could not succeed in both. He pointed out that he was glad to have escaped with Sagan as they worked well together – they had arrived at the finish of the 2014 <b>Strade</b> Bianche in a similar situation, with Kwiatkowski the winner there as well. He said that he thought he had surprised Sagan by sprinting first, rather than waiting for Sagan's sprint. He also acknowledged that he knew from his own experience a year before that it was [...] "very difficult" [...] to race with the pressure of the world champion's rainbow jersey.|$|E
500|$|Fabian Cancellara {{began the}} 2014 cycling season by {{competing}} in the inaugural Dubai Tour. The first stage of the race was a brief individual time trial which Cancellara managed to complete 25 seconds slower than the stage winner Taylor Phinney. Cancellara managed to hold his fifth place overall to the race's finish that ended {{in front of the}} Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Next, Cancellara began the Tour of Qatar, where his highest stage finish, fourth place, came during the race's third stage, an individual time trial. He finished the race in 67th overall in the general classification. On 18 February, Cancellara started the Tour of Oman. Five days later, he completed the race in thirty-first place overall. Cancellara then entered the <b>Strade</b> Bianche, where he finished in sixth place behind winner Michał Kwiatkowski. On 12 March he started the [...] Tirreno–Adriatico.

At Tirreno–Adriatico Sagan won one stage and the points classification. Sagan finished tenth in Milan–San Remo, despite being considered one of pre-race favorites. Then he went on to win E3 Harelbeke and he finished 3rd in Gent–Wevelgem. Sagan's next attempt to win his first monument was at the Tour of Flanders, but he finished 16th. A week later Sagan competed at Paris–Roubaix, where he finished 6th. Sagan won the penultimate stage of the Tour of California, and also won the sprints classification, for the fifth successive year.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Sagan's team {{changed its}} name to , since Liquigas ended its cycling {{sponsorship}} after eight years. Sagan started his season at the Tour de San Luis, coming close to success in the last stage by finishing second behind Mattia Gavazzi. He took his first victory of the season on the second stage of the Tour of Oman. Sagan broke away from a group of chasers in the final kilometres, joined three escapees but continued his effort to bank a solo win. He won again the very next day on a stage that featured the same course as stage 2 of the 2012 edition, which he had won as well. Before the start of stage 5, Sagan announced his withdrawal due to bronchitis. He scored a victory in his very first comeback race, the Gran Premio Città di Camaiore by out sprinting a group of twelve riders. He finished second at <b>Strade</b> Bianche, while his teammate Moreno Moser won the event. Sagan covered the late break attempts to help Moser's bid for victory, then attacked himself to complete a one-two for [...] He went on to win stages 3 and 6 of Tirreno–Adriatico. On stage 3, he out sprinted Mark Cavendish and André Greipel in pouring rain after his team accelerated the race's speed on a small climb nearing the finish. On stage 6, Sagan survived a climb featuring a section at a slated 30% incline, and formed a breakaway with former teammate Vincenzo Nibali and Joaquim Rodríguez. He beat both to the sprint.|$|E
2500|$|Sagan {{began the}} 2017 {{season at the}} Tour Down Under where he {{finished}} in second place on stages 3, 4 and 6. [...] After training {{for the next few}} weeks, Sagan finished in second place at the 2017 Omloop Het Nieuwsblad to Olympic Road Race Champion Greg Van Avermaet. [...] The following day, Sagan attacked the breakaway in the final few hundred meters to take his first victory of the season at Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne. [...] This also marked the first ever victory for the new Bora-Hansgrohe cycling team, and was Sagan's 90th win of his career. [...] Sagan entered the 2017 <b>Strade</b> Bianche as a race favorite, but following a crash roughly 75km into the race, he abandoned 20km later citing illness. [...] Sagan claimed he possibly needed stitches to his hand following that crash and would hope to be ready for the start of his next race later in the week. [...] Sagan achieved his second victory of the season by sprinting to the line ahead of the pack in Stage 3 of Tirreno-Adriatico. [...] Two days later, Sagan sprinted to another victory in Stage 5 of Tirreno-Adriatico following a steep climb against a number of general classification opponents. [...] The next day, he took second place to Colombian sprinter Fernando Gaviria and secured the Red Jersey of the Points Classification. [...] During the final time trial stage of the race, Sagan narrowly avoided injury by swerving out of the way when a woman and her dog abruptly crossed his path.
