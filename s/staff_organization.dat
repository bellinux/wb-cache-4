Wilson took the long way back, visiting the other war theatres in India, China, the Middle East, Italy and England. Wilson found the Army Air Forces Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Barney Giles anxious for Wilson's return so Giles could pay a visit to the war theatres. Wilson {{therefore}} found himself acting chief of staff. On Giles' return, Wilson became Assistant Chief of <b>Staff,</b> <b>Organization,</b> Commitments and Requirements.

25|$|In August 1990, Commander, U.S. Seventh Fleet was {{deployed}} to Bahrain {{in order to}} serve as Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Central Command (ComUSNAVCENT) following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Since ComUSNAVCENT operated from onboard ship, he established NAVCENT-Riyadh as a <b>staff</b> <b>organization</b> to provide continuous Navy representation at United States Central Command headquarters. This mission was assigned initially to Commander, Carrier Group Three. During succeeding months, the NAVCENT-Riyadh staff was augmented substantially but remained small, relative to the United States Army Central and CENTAF staffs. In November, the NAVCENT-Riyadh command was transferred from COMCARGRU 3 to Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group 5. This change resulted in the Navy flag officer at NAVCENT Riyadh's remaining relatively junior to other Service representatives, particularly the Air Force.|$|E
25|$|The Napoleonic Era saw French {{power and}} {{influence}} reach immense heights, even though the period of domination was relatively brief. In the {{century and a half}} preceding the Revolutionary Era, France had transformed demographic leverage to military and political weight; the French population was 19 million in 1700, but this had grown to over 29 million in 1800, much higher than that of most other European powers. These numbers permitted France to raise armies at a rapid pace should the need arise. Furthermore, military innovations carried out during the Revolution and the Consulate, evidenced by improvements in artillery and cavalry capabilities on top of better army and <b>staff</b> <b>organization,</b> gave the French army a decisive advantage in the initial stages of the Napoleonic Wars. Another ingredient of success was Napoleon Bonaparte himself—intelligent, charismatic, and a military genius, Napoleon absorbed the latest military theories of the day and applied them in the battlefield with deadly effect.|$|E

2500|$|In 1910, {{educator}} Abraham Flexner, {{funded by}} the newly established Carnegie Foundation, conducted a study visiting every medical school in the United States and published his findings. With {{the success of the}} Flexner Report, educational leaders and philanthropists called for a similar study of Black institutions. In 1912, the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools announced twelve criteria for accreditation, and the following year published the first annual list of fully accredited colleges and universities. In 1913, Thomas Jesse Jones, a specialist in the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Education, supported by the Phelps-Stokes Fund, directed a two-year study of Black colleges in the United States. Using the Flexner Report as a model, researchers visited [...] "every institution of any importance," [...] including primary schools through colleges, and larger schools [...] "were studied by three or four persons." [...] The scope of analysis included several dimensions, including mission, ownership and control, enrollment, faculty and <b>staff,</b> <b>organization</b> and curriculum, financial management, and physical plant. As part of the study, representatives visited Fisk on three separate occasions, the last shortly after McKenzie's inauguration as President in November 1915. In 1917, Jones, through the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Education, published a two volume study titled Negro Education: A Study of the Private and Higher Schools for Colored People in the United States. The findings noted a [...] "striking unanimity" [...] among educators that Fisk and Howard were the two Black colleges most qualified for further development as universities. The Jones Report cited Fisk's facilities, Christian ideals, location within a one-day journey of four million Blacks, progressive management and cordial relationship with the White Nashville community as the necessary foundation for further development. Jones recommended that Fisk [...] "be adequately financed so that it may strengthen its work as a central institution for college training and social service." [...] The report's release after McKenzie's arrival in Nashville provided a foundation to fund and increase Fisk's academic standards.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} review was to {{critically}} evaluate empirical evidence regarding staff {{factors that contribute to}} families’ satisfaction with ongoing care provision for their relatives with dementia in long-term care. Methods: Four databases were systematically searched using search terms informed by the {{aim of the}} present systematic review. The resulting 14 relevant articles comprised both qualitative and quantitative studies. Results: The findings highlighted three broad areas relating to staff factors that appeared to contribute to families’ satisfaction with care provision: family related factors, relating to staff interaction with families; staffing related factors, focusing on <b>staffing</b> <b>organization</b> and composition; and client related factors, focusing on staff interaction with clients and the quality of care provided. Conclusions: The findings have important implications for care staff and managers working in such settings regarding <b>staffing</b> <b>organization,</b> <b>staff</b> training, recruitment and retention. Future research directions are discussed. Clinical Implications: Families want consistent, knowledgeable staff that interact well and respond appropriately to the needs of their relative as well as their own needs as family members. Staff training in such settings should therefore focus not only on staff education but also on the importance of establishing effective relationships with both clients and families...|$|R
