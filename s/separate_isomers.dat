The β-naphthyl analog of [...] "Nocaine" [...] is a SNDRI though in the case of both the SS and RR enantiomers. Consider the piperidine analogs of brasofensine and tesofensine. These were prepared by NeuroSearch (In Denmark) by the chemists Peter Moldt (2002), and Frank Wätjen (2004-2009). There are four <b>separate</b> <b>isomers</b> to consider (SS, RR, S/R and R/S). This is because there are two chiral carbon sites of asymmetry (means 2 to the power of n isomers to consider where n is the number of chiral carbons). They are therefore a diastereo(iso)meric pair of racemers. With a racemic pair of diastereomers, there is still the question of syn (cis) or anti (trans). In the case of the phenyltropanes, although there are four chiral carbons, there are only eight possible isomers to consider. This is {{based on the fact that}} the compound is bicyclic and therefore does not adhere to the equation given above.|$|E

The discovery of resveratrol in hop pellets highlights the potential health-promoting effect of moderate beer consumption. Here, we have optimized a quantitative extraction procedure for resveratrol in hop pellets. Preliminary removal of hydrophobic bitter compounds with toluene and cyclohexane at room temperature allows 99 % trans-resveratrol recovery by ethanol:water (75 : 25, v/v) solid/liquid extraction at 60 degrees C.

The family of enzymes {{largely responsible for the}} process is the cystienyl aspartic acid proteases (caspases). This study details the design and synthesis of a new class of small molecule caspase inhibitors, namely arylidene oxindoles, which are comparable to the isatin family of inhibitors but which offer the advantage of incorporating three points of variability into the basic scaffold. Moreover, whereas the mode of action of isatins against caspases has been demonstrated to involve nucleophilic addition of the cysteine residue of the enzymes to the C- 3 ketone carbonyl of these substrates, the efficacy of arylidene oxindoles might be expected to involve a Michael attack of the cysteine sulfur onto the beta-carbon of the heterocyclic system in a Michael fashion. Furthermore, NMR investigations into the E/Z isomerization of such arylidene oxindoles were conducted which show that with few exceptions, isomerization is occurring in polar solvents, in which case it was deemed unnecessary to chromatographically <b>separate</b> <b>isomers</b> prior to screening.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of acylcarnitines (AC) in plasma/serum is {{established as a}} useful test for the biochemical diagnosis and the monitoring of treatment of organic acidurias and fatty acid oxidation defects. External quality assurance (EQA) for qualitative and quantitative AC is offered by ERNDIM and CDC in dried blood spots but not in plasma/serum samples. A pilot interlaboratory comparison between 14 European laboratories was performed over 3 years using serum/plasma samples from patients with an established diagnosis of an organic aciduria or fatty acid oxidation defect. Twenty-three different samples with a short clinical description were circulated. Participants were asked to specify the method used to analyze diagnostic AC, to give quantitative data for diagnostic AC with the corresponding reference values, possible diagnosis, and advice for further investigations. Although the reference and pathological concentrations of AC varied among laboratories, elevated marker AC for propionic acidemia, isovaleric acidemia, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiencies were correctly identified by all participants allowing the diagnosis of these diseases. Conversely, the increased concentrations of dicarboxylic AC were not always identified, and therefore the correct diagnosis was not reach by some participants, as exemplified in cases of malonic aciduria and 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-CoA lyase deficiency. Misinterpretation occurred in those laboratories that used multiple-reaction monitoring acquisition mode, did not derivatize, or did not <b>separate</b> <b>isomers.</b> However, some of these laboratories suggested further analyses to clarify the diagnosis.

For structural analysis, fragmentation of negative ions often yields more informative spectra than fragmentation of positive ones but such ions {{are more difficult to}} produce from neutral glycans under MALDI conditions. This work investigates conditions for the formation of both positive and negative ions by MALDI from N-linked glycans released from glycoproteins and their subsequent MS/MS and ion mobility behaviour. 2, 4, 6 -Trihydroxyacetophenone (THAP) doped with ammonium nitrate was found to give optimal ion yields in negative ion mode. Ammonium chloride or phosphate also yielded prominent adducts but anionic carbohydrates such as sulfated N-glycans tended to ionize preferentially. Carbohydrates adducted with all three adducts (phosphate, chloride, and nitrate) produced good negative ion CID spectra but those adducted with iodide and sulfate did not yield fragment ions although they gave stronger signals. Fragmentation paralleled that seen following electrospray ionization providing superior spectra than could be obtained by PSD on MALDI-TOF instruments or with ion traps. In addition, ion mobility drift times of the adducted glycans and the ability of this technique to <b>separate</b> <b>isomers</b> also mirrored those obtained following ESI sample introduction.

This paper examines the CID and ion mobility properties of these endoH-released glycans to determine if the missing GlcNAc influences the production of diagnostic fragment ions. METHODS N-Glycans were released from ribonuclease B, ovalbumin and gp 120 with endoH to give high-mannose and hybrid glycans, and from IgG with endoS to produce biantennary complex glycans, all missing the reducing-terminal GlcNAc residue. Negative ion CID and travelling wave ion mobility spectra were recorded with a Waters Synapt G 2 mass spectrometer using nanospray sample introduction. RESULTS The majority of glycans yielded CID spectra exhibiting the same diagnostic fragments, which were equivalently informative, as the fully released structures.

40|$|The {{construction}} of a liquid nitrogen-cooled ion mobility spectrometer coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry was implemented to demonstrate the ability to discriminate between electronic isomers. Ion mobility allows for the separation of ions based on differing cross-sections-to-charge ratio. This allows for the possible discrimination of species with same mass if the ions differ by cross-section. Time-offlight mass spectrometry was added to mass identify the separated peak for proper identification. A liquid nitrogen-cooled mobility cell was employed for a two-fold purpose. First, the low temperatures increase the peak resolution to aid in resolving the separated ions. This is necessary when isomers may have similar cross-sections. Second, low temperature shortens the mean free path and decreases the neutral buffer gas speeds allowing for more interactions between the ions and the drift gas. Kr 2 + study was performed to verify instrument performance. The variable-temperature ion mobility spectrometer was utilized to separate the distonic and conventional ion forms of CH 3 OH, CH 3 F, and CH 3 NH 2 and to discriminate between the keto and enol forms of the acetone radical cation.

40|$|The {{simulated}} {{moving bed}} (SMB) technology has attracted considerable attention for its efficiency as a chromatographic adsorptive separation. It has been increasingly {{applied to the}} separation of binary mixtures with low separation factors, namely to <b>separate</b> <b>isomers.</b> Although quite {{a vast amount of}} information has been published concerning the simulation and design of operating conditions of existing SMB plants, fewer works have addressed the question of design and optimisation of geometric parameters and operating conditions of a new adsorber, especially when mass transfer resistances are significant. The present work extends an algorithm developed elsewhere to design SMB equipment and optimize its operating conditions and applies it to the case of fructose-glucose separation using a cation-exchange resin as stationary phase in order to obtain nearly pure fructose in the extract and glucose in the raffinate. The constraints were set as 99 % purity for both products. The objective function was chosen to be the adsorbent productivity. The algorithm attempted to find the minimum column lengths for increasing throughputs, which met the required purity constraint. Then, the best construction parameters and operating conditions were chosen as those for which the adsorbent productivity was maximum. The effects of the safety margins applied on the velocity ratios in sections 1 and 4 were examined and a heuristic rule for optimum eluent flowrate was derived. The effect of the purity requirements was also investigated. Finally, the calculated optimal operating points, in terms of flowrate ratios in SMB sections 2 and 3, were analysed in the frame of the equilibrium theory.

40|$|Personal care {{products}} (PCPs) constitute {{a diverse group}} of chemicals that have recently been recognized as emerging contaminants of the aquatic environment, where they are continually introduced primarily by both untreated and treated sewage. They include compounds belonging to different chemical classes: surfactants in detergents (alkyl benzenes), fragrances in cosmetics (nitro and polycyclic musks), antioxidants and preservatives (phenols), plasticizers (phthalates). A multi-analytical method is required to determine these compounds and their bioactive metabolites in wastewater: even if LC/MS and LC/MS/MS are the most common analytical techniques for these soluble compounds, GC/MS and GC/MS/MS are sometimes used to identify and quantify volatile compounds and metabolites, in particular when resolution is mandatory to <b>separate</b> <b>isomers</b> or congeners. In the paper a GC/MS method is presented for the simultaneous analysis of PCPs belonging to different chemical classes in wastewaters: preconcentration and clean-up of the soluble components were performed using solid-phase extraction (SPE) prior to GC-MS determination. Due to the complexity of the aquatic environment where PCPs are introduced as complex mixtures, the chromatograms obtained from wastewater samples are complex signals whose interpretation can be difficult and time-consuming. Therefore, a signal processing procedure can be helpful to extract chemical information on the sample — number of components, abundance distribution — and separation — separation performance, retention pattern. Different extraction procedures were tested and compared, i. e., cartridge composition, solvent type and volume used to elute analytes from the cartridge in order to develop appropriate sample preparation and GC separation conditions to separate as many as possible components of the sample. The developed method may be the basis of wastewater monitoring for temporal and spatial changes of both target and non-target compounds. It will be also applied to monitoring the fate of PCPs in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent to evaluate removal efficiency of PCPs in innovative treatment, i. e., constructed wetlands using natural processes involving wetland vegetation, filling media and their associated microbial colonias...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years the {{simulated}} moving bed technology {{has proven to be}} a powerful concept to <b>separate</b> <b>isomers,</b> in particular enantiomers. Due to the complex multicolumn arrangement, the design and optimization of this process is not a trivial task. The concept is often applied to achieve high purity outlet streams. Based on the assumption that the phase equilibria are established there is a powerful concept available to evaluate the feasibility of the process for highly efficient columns. However, in practice often lower purities are acceptable and cheaper columns can be applied. Rather than performing a complete optimization study, in such cases it is attractive to have in early development stages information available purpose of this paper to present a novel apporach to address this feasibility question based on discrete optimization, which permits the derivation of global infeasibility statements in conjunction with local feasible solutions. In order to achieve this, a mixed-integer linear program is constructed in such a way that its solution set contains all feasible solutions of the underlying non-linear optimization model. If the mixed-integer linear relaxation is infeasible, then it is guaranteed that the nonlinear model has no solution. In addition, an optimal solution of the mixed-integer linear relaxation can provide a feasible solution or a useful starting point for local optimization tools. Our approach for tackling the feasibility question is presented using capacity and separation factors for the separation of mixtures of fructose-dextran T 9 and fructose-raffinose. A conventional 4 zone True Moving Bed (TMB) model is considered in conjunction with technically meaningful restrictions on the operating parameters. The apporach allows to prove lower bounds on the number of plates necessary to separate the mixtures for a specified purity requirement (e. g. 90 or 98 percent). It turns out, for instance, that for separating the mixture fructose-raffinose with a purity requirement of 98 percent (for both extract and raffinate outlets) twenty plates for each of the zones are provably not sufficient, whereas for twenty five plates per zone a solution is given which guarantees a purity of 94. 5 percent for the fructose outlet.

Chemical characterization in terms of fatty acid composition (GC-FID), triacylglycerol profile (GC) and lipid classes (TLC) was performed on all the extracted lipids. The major findings on lipid chemical characterization were the following: (1) T. molitor had the highest lipid content around 13 %; (2) the highest yield was obtained using Folch extraction, and the lowest yield using the aqueous method (from 19 to 60 % related to the lipid recovery of Folch extraction); (3) ¿- 3 fatty acids,which are related to health benefits, weremost abundant in lipids fromaqueous extraction,while¿- 6 fatty acids were most abundant in Folch extractions, except for B. dubia; (4) lipids from Folch and Soxhlet extractions contained free fatty acids and partial glycerides, which were absent in aqueous extractions; (5) triacylglycerol distribution is similar among insect species, {{with high levels of}} ECN 50 – 54 and low amounts of ECN 36 – 38.

Also known as normal-phase HPLC (NP-HPLC) this method separates analytes based on their affinity for a polar stationary surface such as silica, hence it is based on analyte ability to engage in polar interactions (such as hydrogen-bonding or dipole-dipole type of interactions) with the sorbent surface. NP-HPLC uses a non-polar, non-aqueous mobile phase (e.g. Chloroform), and works effectively for separating analytes readily soluble in non-polar solvents. The analyte associates with and is retained by the polar stationary phase. Adsorption strengths increase with increased analyte polarity. The interaction strength depends not only on the functional groups present in the structure of the analyte molecule, but also on steric factors. The effect of steric hindrance on interaction strength allows this method to resolve (<b>separate)</b> structural <b>isomers.</b>|$|R

Mobility separation of precursor ions provides a means of <b>separating</b> the <b>isomers</b> and subsequent VUV PD generates unique fragments allowing them to be distinguished...|$|R
40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are {{industrial}} pollutants {{classified as}} endocrine disruptors {{and can cause}} antagonistic effects in the reproductive, neurological, and immunity systems in humans and animals. The biological toxicity of PCBs depends on the position and number of chlorine atoms within the molecule, and they work to mimic or block essential hormones, causing significant health damages. In the present work, nine different congeners of hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs), with varying number of chlorine atoms, were studied using trapped ion mobility coupled to mass spectrometry (TIMS-MS). In particular, isomers of OH-hepta-chlorinated biphenyls (e. g., 4 -OH-PCB 187, 4 -OH-PCB 172 and 3 -OH-PCB 180) were analyzed individually and as a mixture, to evaluate the analytical power and capabilities of TIMS-MS. Ion-neutral collisional cross sections were determined experimentally and compared to candidate structures. Different strategies to <b>separate</b> molecular <b>isomers</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The chiral {{recognition}} of the centrally acting analgesic agent tapentadol and its isomers with various cyclodextrins (CDs) was studied by capillary electrophoresis, focusing on the migration order of four stereoisomers. In the case of non-charged hydroxypropylated CDs (2 -hydroxypropyl-β-CD, 2 -hydroxypropyl-γ-CD) the beta derivative was able to discriminate the S,R- and R,S-isomers in acidic background electrolyte, whereas the gamma allowed the separation of S,S- and R,R-tapentadol, respectively. Dual CD system containing both hosts was used to separate all of four isomers. Negatively charged sulfated-α-CD at 1. 0 % (w/v) concentration in 100. mM sodium borate buffer (pH 9. 5) was capable of <b>separating</b> the <b>isomers</b> with favorable enantiomer migration order and the optimized method was able to determine 0. 15 % of chiral impurities of tapentadol {{in the presence of}} the last migrating clinically important R,R-isomer...|$|R
50|$|Normal-phase {{chromatography}} {{was one of}} {{the first}} kinds of HPLC that chemists developed. Also known as normal-phase HPLC (NP-HPLC) this method separates analytes based on their affinity for a polar stationary surface such as silica, hence it is based on analyte ability to engage in polar interactions (such as hydrogen-bonding or dipole-dipole type of interactions) with the sorbent surface. NP-HPLC uses a non-polar, non-aqueous mobile phase (e.g. Chloroform), and works effectively for separating analytes readily soluble in non-polar solvents. The analyte associates with and is retained by the polar stationary phase. Adsorption strengths increase with increased analyte polarity. The interaction strength depends not only on the functional groups present in the structure of the analyte molecule, but also on steric factors. The effect of steric hindrance on interaction strength allows this method to resolve (<b>separate)</b> structural <b>isomers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Prymnesium parvum is a harmful {{microalga}} {{which produces}} glycosylated ichthyotoxic metabolites called prymnesins. This thesis describes {{the synthesis of}} chemical tools to explore the biosynthesis and detection of prymnesins. Sugar-nucleotides proposed {{to be involved in}} the glycosylation of prymnesins were synthesised. UDP-α-ᴅ-galactofuranose was biosynthesised from chemosynthetic Galf- 1 -P using galactose- 1 -phosphate uridylyltransferase. GDP-α-ᴅ-arabinopyranose and GDP-β-ʟ- xylopyranose were proposed {{to be involved in the}} biogenesis of ʟ-xylofuranose, and were stereoselectively synthesised by direct displacement of an acylated glycosyl bromide with GDP. Multiple reaction monitoring transitions for the NDP-sugars were recorded using porous graphitic carbon column based LC-MS, as standards for profiling algal cell extracts. Prymnesins share a conserved terminal bis-alkyne, which may prove a useful biomarker. Bisalkyne standards were synthesised by Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling, and used to show that there was no appreciable difference in reactivity between terminal alkynes and bis-alkynes under CuAAC conditions. CuAAC based toxin detection shows potential; coupling of authentic prymnesins with 3 -azido- 7 -hydroxycoumarin gave fluorescent species which were separable by TLC and visible under UV-light. Raman detection was also explored, but was dismissed due to fluorescent quenching by algal pigments. Sugar-glycerol compounds inspired by prymnesin’s glycosylated backbone were chemically synthesised. Neighbouring group participation was utilised to synthesise 1, 2 -trans glycosides. SnCl 2 promoted glycosylation with furanosyl fluorides gave 1, 2 -cis furanosides with moderate stereocontrol, whilst TMSOTf promoted glycosylation with pyranosyl imidates gave 1, 2 -cis pyranosides with excellent stereocontrol. 1, 2 -trans Sugar-glycerol fragments gave NMR signals closer to prymnesin literature values than 1, 2 -cis fragments. Two fragments of prymnesin- 1 glycosylated with α-ʟ-arabinopyranose and α-ᴅ-ribofuranose were chemically synthesised. Possible CuAAC and carbodiimide conjugation of the fragments to a carrier protein for anti-prymnesin- 1 antibody production was considered. Because the stereochemistry of the prymnesin backbones at this region is undefined, both the 2 R- and 2 S- glycerol isomers were synthesised. The <b>separated</b> <b>isomers</b> were distinguished by comparing NOESY NMR with computational models...|$|R
40|$|Cyclodextrin {{capillary}} electrophoresis methods (CD-CZE) were developed for complete enantiomeric and diastereoisomeric separations {{of a series}} of ten dihydropyridone analogues, of which eight were neutral, one was anionic and one was cationic. Ten different systems comprising one or two cyclodextrins were found to successfully <b>separate</b> the <b>isomers</b> thanks to a screening approach. Among the tested cyclodextrins, HS-gamma-CD, either in a single or in a dual system, in a phosphate buffer using capillaries dynamically coated with polyethylene oxide (PEO), and SBE-beta-CD, either in a single or in a dual system, in a borate buffer using uncoated capillaries, were the most selective selectors. The effects of different parameters such as the nature and concentration of the cyclodextrins, nature and concentration of the buffer, and voltage were examined. The precision and limits of detection and quantification were evaluated for the optimized methods. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|R
