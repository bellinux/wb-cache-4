5000|$|A <b>simple</b> <b>link</b> {{creates a}} {{unidirectional}} hyperlink from one element to another via a URI. Example: [...] Some Document [...] Here is {{a link to}} the header. [...] It is an anchor that points to the element with the id [...] "someHeading" [...] on the current page.|$|E
50|$|In the OS/2 {{operating}} system, symbolic links somewhat resemble {{shadows in}} the graphical Workplace Shell. However, shadows, due to the fully object-oriented System Object Model, are considerably more powerful and robust than a <b>simple</b> <b>link.</b> For example, shadows do not lose their capabilities when renamed or when either the object or subject of the link is relocated.|$|E

50|$|XLink {{defines a}} set of {{attributes}} that may be added to elements of other XML namespaces. XLink provides two kinds of hyperlinking for use in XML documents. <b>Simple</b> <b>links</b> connect only two resources, similar to HTML links. Extended links can link an arbitrary number of resources.|$|R
50|$|Ultra-wideband is a {{technology}} for transmitting information {{spread over a}} large bandwidth (>500 MHz) and is generally used for short-range applications (typically 10 metres or less) where a <b>simple</b> <b>link</b> is required from the source device to a monitor or television. As such, it is generally unsuitable for video sender applications that would require a signal {{to be sent to}} another room.|$|E
5000|$|HTML {{supports}} <b>simple</b> <b>link</b> types {{with the}} REL tag and REV tag. Some standards for using these on the WWW were proposed, {{most notably in}} 1994, by people very familiar with earlier work in SGML. However, no such scheme has ever been adopted by {{a large number of}} web users, and the [...] "semantic web" [...] remains unrealized. Attempts such as crit.org have sometimes collapsed totally.|$|E
50|$|Another common {{strategic}} partnership {{involves a}} supplier/manufacturer partnering with a distributor or wholesale consumer. Rather than approach the transactions between the companies as a <b>simple</b> <b>link</b> {{in the product}} or service supply chain, the two companies form a closer relationship where they mutually participate in advertising, marketing, branding, product development, and other business functions. As examples, an automotive manufacturer may form strategic partnerships with its parts suppliers, or a music distributor with record labels.|$|E
50|$|While named graphs {{may appear}} on the Web as <b>simple</b> <b>linked</b> {{documents}} (i.e. Linked Data), they are also very useful for managing sets of RDF data within an RDF store. In particular, the scope of a SPARQL query may be limited to {{a specific set of}} named graphs.|$|R

50|$|Eric Bachman, a BIONIC {{user and}} FoeBuD member, instigated the ZaMir Transnational Network in 1991 in {{response}} to the Yugoslav wars, which were beginning at the time. Za mir means “for peace”, and the network served as a low-cost and <b>simple</b> <b>link</b> between peace groups in that region, as a form of nonviolent resistance. The BIONIC software proved useful under the limited resources available; e.g. in Sarajevo, 1,500 users were served using just 3 telephone lines. Other mailboxes existed in Ljubljana (Slovenia), Zagreb (Croatia), Belgrade (Serbia), Tuzla (Bosnia) and Priština (Kosovo).|$|E
50|$|Isopropyl cyanide (C3H7CN) {{contains}} a carbon atom bounded by a <b>simple</b> <b>link</b> to two methyl (-CH3) structures {{and to a}} cyano group (-CN). The cyano group is constituted by a triple link bound between one carbon and three nitrogen atoms.The greatest contribution {{to the production of}} i-PrCN comes from the reaction of CN radicals (which are accreted from the gas) with the CH3CHCH3 radical, whereas the dominant formation mechanism for n-PrCN is the addition of C2H5 and CH2CN, a process that has no equivalent for the production of i-PrCN.i-PrCN production dominates all reaction mechanisms for which parallel processes are available to both isomers.|$|E
5000|$|S-LINK, for <b>simple</b> <b>link</b> interface, is a {{high-performance}} data acquisition standard developed at CERN for collecting information from particle accelerators and other sources. Unlike similar systems, S-LINK {{is based on}} the idea that data will be collected and stored by computers at both ends of the link, as opposed to a [...] "dumb" [...] devices collecting data to be stored on a [...] "smart" [...] computer. Having a full computer at both ends allows S-LINK to be very thin, primarily defining the logical standards used to feed data at high speed from the motherboards to the link hardware interfaces.|$|E
50|$|The W3C Recommendation called XLink {{describes}} hyperlinks {{that offer}} a far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML. These extended links can be multidirectional, linking from, within, and between XML documents. It also describes <b>simple</b> <b>links,</b> which are unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality than hyperlinks in HTML.|$|R

50|$|The Richardson {{governor}} {{was used for}} stationary and portable engines produced by his employers, Robey & Co.. This is a <b>simple</b> <b>link</b> valve gear controlled automatically by a centrifugal governor. Rather than the Stephenson's manual control of the die-block position within the oscillating link, the Richardson governor adjusts this according to engine speed. It usually operated similarly to a Meyer valve, with two valves driven by two eccentrics and the Richardson governor used instead of the Meyer's manual handwheel. This avoided the wire-drawing problem of the Stephenson's reduced valve travel and improved efficiency for stationary engines that might run at low power for long periods.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, 52 hotels (mainly {{purpose built}} hotels rather than {{physically}} joined to or above Inns) were sold off to another budget hotel group Travelodge. This left Innkeepers Lodge {{with less than}} half of their original number of hotels left. There remain some joined premises however, such as at Borehamwood where the lobby is shared between both the Toby Carvery and Travelodge. As a result, the Toby Inn website for this branch retains a page called 'Hotel Rooms' which is a <b>simple</b> <b>link</b> to Travelodge, whereas the Travelodge website claims this hotel does not offer a cooked breakfast - true, in a strict sense, whereas of course the Toby Inn puts a special buffet breakfast on every morning from 8am for hotel guests (who do not even have to leave the building) and the general public.|$|E
5000|$|... "Heart's All Gone" [...] was {{the second}} song to debut from the band's sixth studio album, Neighborhoods. In {{contrast}} to the debut of the first single, [...] "Up All Night", from Neighborhoods — on influential Los Angeles rock station KROQ — [...] "Heart's All Gone" [...] was released to a much more subdued fanfare, with a <b>simple</b> <b>link</b> from Hoppus' Google+ profile. The link revealed a special site (www.heartsallgone.com), titled and instructing users to [...] "Command the A", by pressing the command (or control) button plus the A key on their keyboards. Doing so would reveal the lyrics and an MP3 download of the song. The song {{was one of the}} first the band performed from Neighborhoods, alongside [...] "After Midnight", [...] "Ghost on the Dance Floor" [...] and [...] "Up All Night", and was debuted on the first night of the band's 10th Annual Honda Civic Tour, at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, New Jersey.|$|E

50|$|MobileMe Calendar Beta was {{released}} on July 6, 2010. MobileMe Calendar Beta included a new web application at me.com with redesigned day, week, and month views, {{as well as a}} new list view to make scanning events easier. Performance was also improved. It also featured new sharing options that allowed invited users to edit a shared calendar. It supported invitations through RSVPs, which sent an email to invited persons, which they answered by clicking a <b>simple</b> <b>link</b> (they didn't have to be MobileMe members). It also supported CalDAV standard for compatibility with multiple devices. However, with these updates came some decreased functionality. The capability to publish iCal calendars as publicly viewable web pages was removed. Users wishing to view a public calendar had to then manually subscribe with a CalDAV compatible calendar device. Compatibility with Microsoft Outlook suffered too, since Outlook users could not sync their primary Outlook calendar to a MobileMe calendar anymore; the only way to integrate MobileMe with Outlook was then to have a MobileMe calendar linked in through CalDAV. This meant that a MobileMe calendar was always seen by Outlook as a secondary calendar, and alarms and notifications did not work.|$|E
5000|$|Much of the {{empirical}} {{research on the}} causal relationship between immigration and crime has been limited due to weak instruments for determining causality. According to one economist writing in 2014, [...] "while {{there have been many}} papers that document various correlations between immigrants and crime for a range of countries and time periods, most do not seriously address the issue of causality." [...] The problem with causality primarily revolves around the location of immigrants being endogenous, which means that immigrants tend to disproportionally locate in deprived areas where crime is higher (because they cannot afford to stay in more expensive areas) or because they tend to locate in areas where there is a large population of residents of the same ethnic background. A burgeoning literature relying on strong instruments provides mixed findings. As one economist describes the existing literature in 2014, [...] "most research for the US indicates that if any, this association is negative... while the results for Europe are mixed for property crime but no association is found for violent crime". Another economist writing in 2014, describes how [...] "the evidence, based on empirical studies of many countries, indicates that there is no <b>simple</b> <b>link</b> between immigration and crime, but legalizing the status of immigrants has beneficial effects on crime rates." ...|$|E

50|$|Different {{variations}} of the algorithm differ {{from each other in}} how the set Q is implemented: as a <b>simple</b> <b>linked</b> list or array of vertices, or as a more complicated priority queue data structure. This choice leads to differences in the time complexity of the algorithm. In general, a priority queue will be quicker at finding the vertex v with minimum cost, but will entail more expensive updates when the value of Cw changes.|$|R

50|$|Both SPBV and SPBM {{inherit the}} rapid {{convergence}} of a link state control plane. A special attribute of SPBM {{is its ability}} to rebuild multicast trees in a similar time to unicast convergence, because it substitutes computation for signaling. When an SPBM bridge has performed the computations on a topology database, it knows whether it is on the shortest path between a root and one or more leaves of the SPT and can install state accordingly. Convergence is not gated by incremental discovery of a bridge’s place on a multicast tree by the use of separate signaling transactions. However, SPBM on a node does not operate completely independently of its peers, and enforces agreement on the current network topology with its peers. This very efficient mechanism uses exchange of a single digest of link state covering the entire network view, and does not need agreement on each path to each root individually. The result is that the volume of messaging exchanged to converge the network is in proportion to the incremental change in topology and not the number of multicast trees in the network. A <b>simple</b> <b>link</b> event that may change many trees is communicated by signaling the link event only; the consequent tree construction is performed by local computation at each node. The addition of a single service access point to a service instance involves only the announcement of the I-SID, regardless of the number of trees. Similarly the removal of a bridge, which might involve the rebuilding of hundreds to thousands of trees, is signaled only with a few link state updates.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSequential {{detection}} (and isolation) {{of unusual}} and {{significant changes in}} network Origin-Destination (OD) traffic volumes from <b>simple</b> <b>link</b> load measurements is considered in the paper. The ambient traffic, i. e. the OD traffic matrix corresponding to the non-anomalous network state, is unknown and it is considered here as a nuisance parameter because it can mask the anomalies. Since the OD traffic matrix is not recoverable from the <b>simple</b> <b>link</b> load measurements, the anomaly detection is an ill-posed decision-making problem. The method discussed in this paper consists of finding a linear parsimonious model of ambient traffic (nuisance parameter) and detecting/isolating anomalies by using an invariant decision algorithm. An optimal sequential algorithm has been discussed in our previous publication, the main goal of the actuel paper is to discuss a simple ``snapshot'' algorithm based on the last vector of observations...|$|E
