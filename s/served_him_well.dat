5|$|Ort's Oldies, a used {{record store}} on Jackson Street, and its proprietor, William Orten Carlton, {{commonly}} known as Ort, were among the institutional figures that made the Athens music scene possible. Ort has an excellent memory for rock trivia, which <b>served</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> in running the store. Perhaps more importantly, his off-the-wall {{sense of humor and}} warmly iconoclastic personality (and his thrift-sale wardrobe) were regularly on display at parties, gigs and musical venues around town.|$|E
5|$|This {{intolerance}} for incompetence <b>served</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> when {{he accepted}} the invitation of Dunn to be his replacement {{as director of the}} Aggie Band. Adams began his tenure with an undisciplined band devoid of experience and ravaged by years of war, but in his first year of leadership, the ranks of the band quickly swelled to 225members. Infantry and field artillery associations were no longer required by the Army and Adams changed the units' names to the Maroon and White Bands.|$|E
5|$|After briefly reading {{law with}} former New Hampshire Governor Levi Woodbury, a family friend, in Portsmouth, {{he spent a}} {{semester}} at Northampton Law School in Northampton, Massachusetts, followed by a period of study in 1826 and 1827 under Judge Edmund Parker in Amherst, New Hampshire. He {{was admitted to the}} New Hampshire bar in late 1827 and began to practice in Hillsborough. Pierce lost his first case, but soon proved capable as a lawyer. Despite never being a legal scholar, his memory for names and faces <b>served</b> <b>him</b> <b>well,</b> as did his personal charm and deep voice. In Hillsborough, his law partner was Albert Baker, who had studied law under Pierce and was the brother of Mary Baker Eddy.|$|E
50|$|Jack {{is prone}} to fits of righteous anger in which he will dive into {{situations}} rashly, though luck, skill and creative improvisation usually <b>serve</b> <b>him</b> <b>well.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1934, he was {{appointed}} Bishop of Port Pirie, South Australia, gaining an experience in dealing with pastoral problems that was to <b>serve</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> in his later position.|$|R
5000|$|Jean-Jacques Honorat would {{continue}} to be a successful and favored personality on the diplomatic scene, his degrees in agronomy and law, along with his fluency in French, Spanish and English <b>serving</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> throughout his remaining career.|$|R
5|$|Himmler's organised, bookish intellect <b>served</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> as {{he began}} setting up {{different}} SS departments. In 1931 he appointed Reinhard Heydrich chief of the new Ic Service (intelligence service), which was renamed the Sicherheitsdienst (SD: Security Service) in 1932. He later officially appointed Heydrich his deputy. The two men had a good working relationship and a mutual respect. In 1933, they began to remove the SS from SA control. Along with Interior Minister Frick, they hoped to create a unified German police force. In March 1933, Reich Governor of Bavaria Franz Ritter von Epp appointed Himmler chief of the Munich Police. Himmler appointed Heydrich commander of Department IV, the political police. That same year, Hitler promoted Himmler {{to the rank of}} SS-Obergruppenführer, equal in rank to the senior SA commanders. Thereafter, Himmler and Heydrich took over the political police of state after state; soon only Prussia was controlled by Göring.|$|E
5|$|It was Shea's {{responsibility}} {{to bring that}} engineering discipline to North American and to NASA's management of its contractors. His systems management experience <b>served</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> in his new post. In the coming years, any change {{to the design of}} the Apollo spacecraft would have to receive its final approval from Joe Shea. He kept control of the program using a management tool that he devised for himself—a looseleaf notebook, more than a hundred pages in length, that would be put together for him every week summarizing all of the important developments that had taken place and decisions that needed to be made. Presented with the notebook on Thursday evenings, Shea would study and annotate it over the weekend and return to work with new questions, instructions, and decisions. This idiosyncratic tool allowed him to keep tabs on a complex and ever-expanding program.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, Clifford ran and {{took part in}} weekly adult parties for his friends and clients around London. This brought him into contact with various madams and prostitutes, a {{connection}} which later <b>served</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> in his business to satisfy the often bizarre needs of his clients, as well as alerting him to the interesting behaviour of various persons.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in London, England and educated at Trinity College, Oxford, {{receiving}} a B.A. in 1619. At college, he met Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, a connection that would <b>serve</b> <b>him</b> <b>well.</b> He joined Trinity College's faculty in 1632.|$|R
50|$|In 1974, Ways and Means {{chairman}} Al Ullman named Rostenkowski {{chairman of}} the committee's newly created subcommittee on health. In this role Rostenkowski obtained expertise in two critical areas of policy that would <b>serve</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> in his future: health care and taxes.|$|R
5000|$|Talese {{credits his}} mother as the role model he {{followed}} {{in developing the}} interviewing techniques that would <b>serve</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> later in life, interviewing such varied subjects as mafia members and middle-class Americans on their sexual habits. He relates in A Writer's Life: ...|$|R
25|$|Although {{he lacked}} speed and didn't hit for power, Tebbetts was an {{exceptional}} defensive catcher and intelligent player who capably directed his pitchers. These traits <b>served</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> {{later in his}} career, as he became the manager for the Cincinnati Reds, Milwaukee Braves and the Cleveland Indians. His major league career encompassed 14 years as a catcher, 11 as a manager and 28 as a scout.|$|E
25|$|Canada's {{sixteenth and}} {{youngest}} Prime Minister, he served with distinction as Secretary of State for External Affairs, President of the Privy Council and Minister responsible for Constitutional Affairs. His talent for negotiation and consensus diplomacy has <b>served</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> {{in politics and}} as Representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations in Cyprus. He has earned the admiration of all Canadians {{as one of our}} country's most respected statesmen.|$|E
25|$|In 1757, {{at the age}} of 12, Kutuzov {{entered an}} elite military-engineering school as a cadet private. He quickly became popular with his peers and {{teachers}} alike, proving himself to be highly intelligent, and showed bravery in his school's numerous horse-races. Kutuzov studied military and civil subjects there, learned to speak French, German and English fluently, and later studied Polish, Swedish, and Turkish; his language skills <b>served</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> throughout his career. In October 1759, he became a corporal.|$|E
50|$|Watson takes Holmes to a friend's estate near Reigate in Surrey to rest after {{a rather}} strenuous case in France. Holmes finds that his {{services}} are needed here, {{but he also}} finds that his recent illness <b>serves</b> <b>him</b> <b>well.</b> His host is Colonel Hayter.|$|R
50|$|He {{was the son}} of Captain Hon. John Hamilton and {{grandson}} of James Hamilton, 7th Earl of Abercorn. He was educated at Harrow and Pembroke College, Cambridge. There he became the friend of William Pitt the Younger, a connection that would <b>serve</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> in later years.|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Alex Henderson states, [...] "Ribot {{approaches}} avant-garde jazz {{in a very}} different way. Saints is full of discernible melodies; typically, Ribot will warmly embrace a melody before he ventures outside. And that inside/outside contrast <b>serves</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> throughout this excellent and very unpredictable CD".|$|R
25|$|Besides its {{historical}} firsts, the canal's most significant impact was {{to stimulate the}} growth of New York City {{along with the other}} anthracite canals. Fueled by the cheap and plentiful coal barged up the canal and down the river, the city was able to develop and industrialize at the same pace as other Eastern cities. There would be other benefits to the city as well. The company's first president, Philip Hone, served a term as the city's mayor during the canal's construction. Later, John Roebling's experience building the canal <b>served</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> in designing the Brooklyn Bridge.|$|E
25|$|After {{the three}} invasions, {{the people of}} Đại Việt were finally able to enjoy {{a long period of}} {{prosperity}} and peace during the reigns of Trần Anh Tông, Trần Minh Tông, and Trần Hiến Tông. Anh Tông was the first Trần emperor to reign without facing attacks from the Mongol Empire. Despite the deaths of the two most important generals of the early Trần dynasty, Trần Quang Khải in 1294 and Trần Quốc Tuấn in 1300, the Emperor was still served by many efficient mandarins like Trần Nhật Duật, Đoàn Nhữ Hài, Phạm Ngũ Lão, Trương Hán Siêu, Mạc Đĩnh Chi, and Nguyễn Trung Ngạn. Anh Tông was very strict in suppressing gambling and corruption, but he also generously rewarded those who <b>served</b> <b>him</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E
25|$|After {{staying on}} during the fifteenth season under Williams for a brief {{handover}} period, Holmes also left the programme, and his replacement, Anthony Read, worked with Williams, who was told to create a less violent and more humour-based approach, much to Baker's liking. The actor now felt very possessive of the part and frequently argued with directors over his inclusion of ad-libbed lines, but he was extremely pleased when the levity of the show increased even further after the departure of Read and the hiring of Douglas Adams as script editor for season seventeen in 1979. Some fans have criticised Adams for introducing {{too much of the}} sort of humorous content that <b>served</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. However, others consider some of Adams' scripts to be among the series' high points, with City of Death (1979) being the primary example.|$|E
5000|$|Willett {{was placed}} {{in charge of the}} Plymouth Colony's trading post with the Native Americans at Castine in what is now Maine, and there {{developed}} the skills in trade and native language which would <b>serve</b> <b>him</b> <b>well.</b> The French forced Plymouth to abandon their operations at Castine in 1635.|$|R
2500|$|At Kidston & Sons, Law {{received}} a nominal salary, on {{the understanding that}} he would gain a [...] "commercial education" [...] from working there that would <b>serve</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> as a businessman. In 1885 the Kidston brothers decided to retire, and agreed to merge the firm with the Clydesdale Bank.|$|R
50|$|Thirteen years later, Charlie, now 31, {{has grown}} up and is working at the Waterside cemetery. Every evening at dusk he goes to a nearby forest where he plays with Sam. Charlie has the gift of seeing ghosts. This <b>serves</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> as an undertaker, as he can talk with ghosts.|$|R
25|$|Lougheed {{spent most}} of his tenure as premier in a bitter fight with the federal {{government}} over control of Alberta's resources. His first term also saw the start of a decade-long development boom, and he later established the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund, which used oil revenues to invest for the long term in such areas as health care and research. He won an even stronger mandate in 1975, reducing the opposition to only six MLAs in total (four Socreds, one New Democrat and one independent) on a record 62.7 percent of the popular vote, more than Manning had drawn during the height of Social Credit's power in the 1950s. He would lead the party to two more landslide victories in 1979 and 1982. His last victory netted the PCs a staggering 75 seats out of 79: in terms of percentage of seats won, the second-largest majority government in the province's history. As a result, he governed with very large majorities for virtually his entire tenure and {{was in a position to}} enact practically any program he wanted. Indeed, the six MLAs he faced in 1975 would be the most opposition he would face during his last decade in office. That <b>served</b> <b>him</b> <b>well,</b> since he was a Red Tory leading a party whose base was dominated by social conservatives in rural parts of the province.|$|E
500|$|Three {{more years}} of such bloodshed {{remained}} and eight larger and bloodier battles were yet to come. Grant later {{came to realize that}} his prediction of one great battle bringing the war to a close would probably not occur. The war would continue, at great cost in casualties and resources, until the Confederacy succumbed or the Union was divided. Grant also learned a valuable personal lesson on preparedness that (mostly) <b>served</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> {{for the rest of the}} war.|$|E
500|$|In September 1855, when Rockefeller was sixteen, he got {{his first}} job as an {{assistant}} bookkeeper working for a small produce commission firm called Hewitt & Tuttle. He worked long hours and delighted, as he later recalled, in [...] "all the methods and systems of the office." [...] He was particularly adept at calculating transportation costs, which <b>served</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> later in his career. Making 50 cents a day, the full salary for his first three months' work was $50 (equivalent to $ in [...] dollars).|$|E
50|$|Though born in São Paulo, Onalfo {{grew up in}} Ridgefield, Connecticut, {{and played}} high school soccer at Ridgefield High School, before going on to play four years of college soccer at the University of Virginia under Bruce Arena - an {{association}} that would <b>serve</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> in his later coaching career.|$|R
50|$|After a {{while his}} family moved back to Dunston and Clasper became {{employed}} as a coke burner and wherryman for the Garesfield Coke Company at nearby Derwenthaugh. His work as a wherryman would also <b>serve</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> in later life. Clasper then worked for a while at Hawks, Crawshay and Sons Ironworks around the mid-1830s.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} year, in 1960, Anderson {{also became}} the public-address voice of Churchill Downs, {{home of the}} Kentucky Derby. He would call 16 Runs for the Roses between then and 1977. During that stretch, Anderson also worked as a Midwest sports anchor, gaining the TV experience that would <b>serve</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> nationally in the 1970s.|$|R
500|$|In Andrew Niccol's {{science fiction}} film Gattaca (1997), [...] "one {{of the more}} {{interesting}} scripts" [...] Hawke said he had read in [...] "a number of years", he played the role of a man who infiltrates a society of genetically perfect humans by assuming another man's identity. Although Gattaca was not a success at the box office it drew generally favorable reviews from critics; The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reviewer wrote that [...] "Hawke, building on the sympathetic-but-edgy presence that has <b>served</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> since his kid-actor days, is most impressive".|$|E
500|$|Rhythmically, Tchaikovsky {{sometimes}} {{experimented with}} unusual meters. More often, {{he used a}} firm, regular meter, a practice that <b>served</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> in dance music. At times, his rhythms became pronounced enough to become the main expressive agent of the music. They also became a means, found typically in Russian folk music, of simulating movement or progression in large-scale symphonic movements—a [...] "synthetic propulsion," [...] as Brown phrases it, which substituted for the momentum that would be created in strict sonata form by the interaction of melodic or motivic elements. This interaction generally does not take place in Russian music. (For more on this, please see Repetition below.) ...|$|E
500|$|At [...] tall, and {{weighing}} , Dallas would later surprise observers with {{his ability to}} fit into the cramped cockpits of fighter planes. Despite his size, he was considered a fine athlete with quick reflexes. Although he could project a loud speaking voice, he was generally soft-spoken and was not known to curse or drink alcohol, nor often to smoke. Dallas stayed fit through regular exercise at the gym, and played rugby union football. He had exceptionally keen eyesight, which he had trained by reading small print in newspapers at the six-foot length of his family's table. To balance out athletics, he participated in amateur theatrics, where his strong voice <b>served</b> <b>him</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E
50|$|Despite {{enduring}} a lot {{of discrimination}} in his early days in the army, Jusuf rose through the ranks, becoming a brigadier general in 1983 and even serving as a senior staff member in army intelligence. Jusuf attributes his success to hard work, discipline and patience, qualities which would <b>serve</b> <b>him</b> <b>well</b> later in establishing the association.|$|R
5000|$|A woman's {{husband and}} child {{are killed by}} agents of her mother (or, sometimes, stepmother). The woman buries them, cuts her hair, changes her name from [...] "Fair Elise" [...] or [...] "Fair Elinor" [...] to [...] "Sweet William", {{and goes to the}} king's court to become his servant.
