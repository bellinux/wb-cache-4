5|$|A 1993 review {{estimated}} that the macaroni was the most abundant species of penguin, {{with a minimum of}} 11,841,600 pairs worldwide. Macaroni penguins range from the Subantarctic to the Antarctic Peninsula; at least 216 breeding colonies at 50 sites have been recorded. In <b>South</b> America, macaroni penguins are found in southern Chile, the Falkland Islands, <b>South</b> Georgia and the <b>South</b> Sandwich Islands, and <b>South</b> Orkney Islands. They also occupy much of Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula, including the northern <b>South</b> Shetland Islands, Bouvet Island, the Prince Edward and Marion islands, the Crozet Islands, the Kerguelen Islands, and the Heard and McDonald Islands. While foraging for food, groups will range north to the islands off Australia, New Zealand, southern Brazil, Tristan da Cunha, and <b>South</b> Africa.|$|E

The <b>South</b> Africa rugby team's 1969–70 tour of Britain and Ireland was accompanied by mass demonstrations against apartheid, including an attempt by a protester in London to hijack the <b>South</b> African team bus, and a demonstration in Dublin where people {{tried to stop the}} <b>South</b> Africans from reaching the match venue by lying {{down in the middle of}} the street. The <b>South</b> Africa cricket team was due to tour England shortly afterwards, and the MCC remained keen for the series to go ahead. They cancelled the tour a week before the <b>South</b> Africans were due to arrive, following public protests and pressure from the UK government. Virulent anti-apartheid demonstrations in Australia during the <b>South</b> Africa rugby team's 1971 tour led to soaring police costs, matches played behind fences and barbed wire, and a state of emergency in Queensland, all of which prompted the Australian Cricket Board to cancel the tour by the <b>South</b> Africa cricket team that had been scheduled to follow.|$|E
