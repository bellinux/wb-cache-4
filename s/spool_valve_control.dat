40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} control {{approach}} that provides significant energy savings {{for the control}} of pneumatic servo systems. The control methodology is formulated by decoupling the standard four-way <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> used for pneumatic servo control into two three-way valves, then using the resulting two control degrees of freedom to simultaneously satisfy a performance constraint based on the sliding mode sliding condition, and an energy-saving dynamic constraint that mini-mizes cylinder pressures. The control formulation is presented, followed by experimental results that indicate significant energetic savings with essentially no compromise in tracking perform-ance relative to a standard sliding mode approach. Relative to a standard four-way <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> <b>controlled</b> pneumatic servo actuator under sliding mode control, the experimental results indicate energy savings of 27 to 45 %, depending on the desired tracking frequency.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{describes}} the modeling {{and control of}} a direct-injection monopropellant-powered actuator. The actuation system utilizes the catalytic decomposition of a monopropellant, the products of which are directly injected into opposing chambers of a pneumatic cylinder {{in order to obtain}} a controllable force source. The system incorporates a pair of proportional liquid fuel valves and a three-way rotary <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> to <b>control</b> the pressurization and depressurization of each chamber of the actuator. A model of the catalytic decomposition of the monopropellant and the compressible gas dynamics is derived in order to control the output force of the hot gas actuator. Using a Lyapunov function, a model-based sliding mode controller is developed for the multi-input single-output nonlinear system. Experimental results of the actuator force tracking demonstrate the validity of the model of the monopropellant-based actuator and the performance of the nonlinear controller. I...|$|R
40|$|In this research, {{the four}} valve {{independent}} metering configuration {{is to be}} investigated. The Independent metering concept will be emphasized and compared to <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> coupled metering conventional technologies. Research focuses on the energy savings potential of the four valve independent metering configuration in addition to improving performance. The basic model {{of interest in this}} research is an actuator that is controlled by the four valve independent metering configuration to move beam like members of mobile hydraulic equipment such as tractor loader backhoes, excavators, and telehandlers. Five distinct (or discrete) metering modes that exist in the literature are initially studied: Powered Extension, High Side Regeneration Extension, Low Side Regeneration Extension, Powered Retraction, and Low Side Regeneration Retraction. The energy saving potential of these modes is studied and comparisons between this system and a conventional <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> <b>controlled</b> actuator are conducted. The problem of switching between these five modes is treated as an optimal control problem of a switched dynamic system. Before solving the optimal control problem, a dynamic model for the system of interest is first derived. The model is experimentally validated. General theory for the optimal control problem is derived and then applied to the hydraulic system of interest. The results are then interpreted and explained by looking into the force-speed capability of modes. The effect of mode switching on system performance is studied as well. The basic mechanical system used for this analysis is a continuous rotating beam that undergoes structural vibrations due to mode switching in the driving hydraulic actuator. A fully coupled actuator-beam model is investigated. A non-dimensional analysis is pursued to generalize the study results. The optimal switching analysis and the vibrational study lead to the idea of Continuously Variable Modes (CVMs). Instead of having five distinct modes that determines the flow path by opening two of the four valves in the assembly, three Continuously Variable Modes are presented as an alternative way of controlling the four-valve configuration. These three CVMs combine the distinct modes and use three of the four valves to provide the fluid flow path. The five distinct modes become a special case of these three CVMs. It is going to be shown that CVMs have more force-speed capabilities than the distinct modes and provide for better velocity and vibrational performance by virtue of always offering a continuous flow path. The theory behind CVMs is presented and experimental validation follows. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Wayne J.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{increasing}} use of sensors in mobile hydraulic equipment, the need for hydraulic pilot lines is decreasing, being replaced by electrical wiring and electrically con-trollable components. For controlling some of the existing hydraulic components there are, however, still a need for being able to generate a hydraulic pilot pressure. In this paper con-trolling a hydraulic variable pump is considered. The LS-pressure is measured electrically and the hydraulic pilot pressure is generated using a small <b>spool</b> <b>valve.</b> From a <b>control</b> point of view there are two approaches for controlling this system, by either generating a copy of the LS-pressure, the LS-pressure being the output, or letting the output be the pump pressure.

40|$|A <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> as a flow {{direction}} <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> has usually {{been used in}} a hydraulic system. In recent years, some hydraulic actuator systems need high accuracy <b>control</b> of the <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> {{in order to control}} the delivery precisely. For the reason, it is very important practically to know dynamic motion of the spool. To analyze the dynamic characteristics of the <b>spool</b> <b>valve,</b> it is necessary to consider the dynamic motion of the spool.

The motion of the spool is governed complicatedly by pressure force, flow force, electromagnetic force and mechanical spring force acting on itself. As a result, it is difficult to analyze the dynamic motion of the spool, and therefore, any commercial code to calculate the dynamic characteristics of the <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> dose not exist at present.

40|$|Recent {{research}} on hydraulic systems has mainly focused on energy saving.

A <b>spool</b> <b>valve</b> can turn the flow of hydraulic fluid from a hydraulic pump to an actuator in forward or reverse directions or on and off by blocking offthe route of the fluid takes. A controller moves the valve back and forth in its case to slide the spools into different positions.

Once the spool starts moving, the inlet port becomes non circular and continues to be so till closure. The shape and the area of the port that is still left open for the oil to flow is steadily changing. The area which is originally circular is becoming far away from circularity.

This unique single-tube, sear-tripping, blow-forward operation is comparable to, though not identical to, the operation of the Automag. In the SLG, the recocking mechanism is air pressure acting on a smaller, forward-facing area to push the bolt back open when the pressure in the dump chamber—which acts on a larger, rearward-facing area—reaches a low pressure from firing and venting the dump chamber. In the Automag, this is accomplished by the return spring. If the sear is tripped but the dump chamber is not vented due to the bolt failing to close, the bleed button on the back cap can be depressed, which vents the dump to the outside through the back cap, thus allowing the bolt to recock.|$|R
