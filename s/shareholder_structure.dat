40|$|Abstract We {{examine the}} {{governance}} role of multiple large <b>shareholder</b> <b>structures</b> (MLSS) {{to determine their}} valuation effects {{in a sample of}} 1, 252 publicly traded firms from nine East Asian economies. We find that the presence, number, and size of multiple large shareholders are associated with a significant valuation premium. Our results also show that the identity of MLSS influences corporate value and that the valuation effects of MLSS are more pronounced in firms with greater agency costs. Our results imply that MLSS play a valuable monitoring role in curbing the diversion of corporate resources.

40|$|Governance in Japan {{is moving}} from a system of stable "insider" {{relations}} to a more flexible model of market-based "outsider" or shareholder participation and control. This transformation remains costly and time consuming. But {{major changes in the}} commercial code, the bankruptcy code, accounting rules, <b>shareholder</b> <b>structures,</b> and labor market contracts have already shifted the "rules of the game" towards a more open market economy. It is now necessary to enforce the implementation of these governance reforms by keeping a strong focus on transparency at every level, and by pushing the swift progress of the "accounting big bang" and the privatization of the postal savings system. ...|$|R

This paper describes Spanish family firms' <b>shareholder</b> <b>structures</b> and explains which first-second largest shareholders' combinations are most common. The paper {{shows that the}} most common combination within our sample is families and individuals as first shareholders plus families and individuals as second largest shareholders, but that other combinations also exist: families and individuals plus banks, families and individuals and non-financial firms and even two non-financial firms as largest shareholders. In addition, the paper analyzes the impact of different shareholders' combinations on firm performance. The results do not support that any shareholders' combination influences significantly family firm performance.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the inefficiencies that might {{arise in the}} ownership structure chosen at the initial public offering stage. We show that, contrary to what is commonly believed, the desire of initial owners to maximize their proceeds leads them to choices that, although privately optimal, may be socially inefficient. This distortion tends {{to be in the}} direction of excessive incidence of controlling <b>shareholder</b> <b>structures</b> and excessive divestment of cash flow rights. Our analysis has far-reaching policy implications for dual class stock, stock pyramiding, sale of control rules, and public offerings of minority shares. Among its positive implications, our analysis suggests reasons for the substantial differences in the incidence of control blocks across different countries. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} whether the {{presence}} of multiple large shareholders alleviates a firm's agency costs and information asymmetry manifested {{in the cost of}} equity financing. Using data for 1165 corporations from 8 East Asian and 13 Western European countries, we find evidence that the implied cost of equity decreases with the presence, number, and voting size of large shareholders beyond the controlling owner. We also find that the identity of the second largest shareholder is important in determining the risk of corporate expropriation in family-controlled firms. Our regional analysis reveals that, mainly in East Asian firms, multiple large <b>shareholders</b> <b>structures</b> exert an internal governance role in curbing private benefits and reducing information asymmetry, perhaps to sidestep deficiencies in the external institutional environment.

40|$|The ‘independent director’ was {{introduced}} {{as a corporate}} governance tool in the United States in the 1970 s and quickly spread to the United Kingdom {{and from there to}} Continental Europe and Asian economies. The research presented in this video examines whether this legal transplant works in economies that have different <b>shareholder</b> <b>structures</b> and thus different agency conflicts than the US, and asks why these countries adopted it. Using comparative analysis, HARALD BAUM explains, the researchers discovered that – depending on the context – the independent director can be an almost meaningless tool. They also found that countries were impelled to introduce the concept due to a competition for funds from international investors and organizations that work on American principles of corporate governance. The research results suggest that a greater variety of regulatory tools might be fruitful for the international market...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} family ownership structure and corporate value across a sample of 1314 firm-year observations of China’s family publicly listed companies (PLCs), from 2004 to 2008. We find a significant inverse-U-shaped relationship between the controlling family’s ultimate cash-flow rights and corporate value; as measured by Tobin’s Q. That is, as family-ownership concentration increases, corporate value first increases and then decreases. This finding refreshes {{our understanding of the}} relationship between family-ownership concentration and corporate value in emerging economies such as found in China. We corroborate prior findings that when controlling families hold excess control over cash-flow rights, corporate value is significantly lowered, while multiple large <b>shareholders</b> <b>structure</b> is significantly associated with higher corporate value. In addition; board independence is found to significantly improve corporate value in the context of family-concentrated ownership. We also test for potential endogeneity between family ownership and corporate value and find our results to be robust...|$|R
