40|$|Abstract Background It is {{increasingly}} recognized that standing represents {{a simple solution}} to extended periods of sitting. However, it is currently unknown whether workplace <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> is prospectively associated with a lower incidence of chronic diseases. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the association between workplace <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> and the incidence of overweight/obesity (OW/OB) and impaired glucose tolerance/type 2 diabetes (IGT/T 2 D) in adults. Methods A longitudinal analysis from the Quebec Family Study (Canada) was conducted on 293 participants, aged 18 to 65  years, followed for a mean of 6  years. Information on self-reported occupational <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> as well as several covariates was collected at both baseline and follow-up. Outcome measures included the development of OW/OB (i. e. body mass index ≥ 25  kg/m 2) and IGT/T 2 D (i. e. 2 -h postload plasma glucose level ≥ 7. 8  mmol/L). Results The incidence rates of OW/OB and IGT/T 2 D over the 6 -year follow-up period were 17. 4 % and 12. 6 %, respectively. Significant negative associations were observed between the amount of occupational <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> and the development of outcome measures. However, the associations were no longer significant after adjustment for age, sex, smoking habits, total annual family income, daily caloric intake, and submaximal working capacity. In age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression analysis, significant negative linear trends were observed across levels of <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> and the outcome variables. However, the associations were no longer significant after further adjustment for the other covariates. Finally, we observed that the change in <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> from baseline to year 6 was significantly associated with the development of outcome measures, with higher incidence rates in adults reporting a reduction in <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> at follow-up. However, the associations became non-significant after adjustment for covariates. Conclusions Greater occupational <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> is not sufficient in and of itself to prevent the development of OW/OB and IGT/T 2 D in adults. Future efforts are needed to better understand the potential benefits of higher amounts of <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> throughout the day on the prevention of chronic diseases...|$|E

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of high voltage power transformers consists of several phases such as design, assembly, drying and impregnation process which are time consuming. Before electrical testing, a transformer needs an extra <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> for further impregnation of cellulose material in particular those of high density. It {{should be noted}} that the duration of the <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> depends on the ratings of the transformer. The main reason for considering this <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> is to reduce the probability of failure during electrical testing. This means that the reduction of such <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> is a crucial issue. Therefore, the main goal of this thesis is to optimize the post impregnation process of high density cellulosic material. One of the requirements for shortening the post impregnation <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> is that during the electrical tests of the transformer the PD level should not exceed the PD acceptance given by IEC standard level. In this thesis, it is investigated if the <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> is related to the occurrence of partial discharges in high density materials. This is done by performing a number of partial discharge measurement on different samples. Further on, tan? measurements were performed on different samples in the course of impregnation process to investigate whether the losses decrease in the course of time. In this research, the impregnation processes of two different cellulosic materials, namely transformerboard (PSP) an laminated wood (KP) are studied. Based on that, an empirical model that predicts the time needed to fully impregnate a cellulosic sample is developed. This model relates the impregnation time with sample material, dimensions, shapes, impregnation and temperature. The proposed model shows a good agreement with the measurementsElectrical Sustainable EnergyElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E

However, as time spent sitting may be detrimental to health, research is needed to examine whether accelerometer sedentary cut-points reflect the amount of time children spend sitting. The aim of this study was to: a) examine agreement between ActiGraph (AG) cut-points for sedentary time and objectively-assessed periods of free-living sitting and sitting plus <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> using the activPAL (aP); and b) identify cut-points to determine time spent sitting and sitting plus standing. Methods Forty-eight children (54 % boys) aged 8 – 12 years wore a waist-mounted AG and thigh-mounted aP for two consecutive school days (9 – 3 : 30 pm). AG data were analyzed using 17 cut-points between 50 – 850 counts·min− 1 in 50 counts·min− 1 increments to determine sedentary time during class-time, break time and school hours. Sitting and sitting plus <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> were obtained from the aP for these periods. Limits of agreement were computed to evaluate bias between AG 50 to AG 850 sedentary time and sitting and sitting plus <b>standing</b> <b>time.</b> Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analyses identified AG cutpoints that maximized sensitivity and specificity for sitting and sitting plus <b>standing</b> <b>time.</b> Results The smallest mean bias between aP sitting time and AG sedentary time was AG 150 for class time (3. 8 minutes), AG 50 for break time (− 0. 8 minutes), and AG 100 for school hours (− 5. 2 minutes). For sitting plus <b>standing</b> <b>time,</b> the smallest bias was observed for AG 850. ROC analyses revealed an optimal cut-point of 96 counts·min− 1 (AUC = 0. 75) for sitting time, which had acceptable sensitivity (71. 7 %) and specificity (67. 8 %). No optimal cut-point was obtained for sitting plus standing (AUC = 0. 51).

40|$|Background: Evidence on the {{detrimental}} {{health effects}} of prolonged sedentary behavior is accumulating. Interventions {{need to have a}} specific focus on sedentary behavior in order to generate clinically meaningful decreases in sedentary time. When evaluating such intervention, the question whether a participant improved or deteriorated their behavior is fundamental and instruments that are able to detect those changes are essential. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the criterion validity against activPAL and responsiveness to change of two activity monitors (ActiGraph and activPAL) and two questionnaires for the assessment of occupational sitting and <b>standing</b> <b>time.</b> Methods: 42 participants took part in the Stand@Work intervention trial. Six (T 0) and two (T 1) weeks before they received a sit-stand workstation and three weeks thereafter (T 2), participants wore an ActiGraph and an activPAL activity monitor, and completed the Occupational Sitting and Physical Activity Questionnaire (OSPAQ) and the Workforce Sitting Questionnaire (WSQ). The activPAL was used as the criterion validity measure. Results: The ActiGraph showed strong validity for occupational sedentary time at T 0 and T 1 (Spearman rho = 0. 77 and 0. 69), but its validity dropped substantially after introduction of the sit-stand workstation (rho = 0. 19). Correlations between occupational light-intensity activity assessed by the ActiGraph and occupational <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> assessed by the activPAL varied between 0. 25 - 0. 63. The occupational sitting validity correlation of the OSPAQ and WSQ varied from 0. 35 - 0. 48 and 0. 25 - 0. 30, respectively, and between 0. 16 - 0. 68 for the OSPAQ for occupational <b>standing</b> <b>time.</b> The intervention-induced changes in occupational sitting and <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> were well detected by the activPAL, OSPAQ and WSQ (sitting only), but not by the ActiGraph, which had the lowest responsiveness to change. Conclusions: This study suggests that studies aimed at determining differences in occupational sitting and <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> should use activPAL-type inclinometers as a preferred type of objective measure. Simple questionnaires showed sufficient validity and are usable in addition to an objective measure or alone when objective monitoring is not possible. The hip-worn ActiGraph was unable to distinguish between occupational sitting and <b>standing</b> <b>time,</b> when using uniaxial data and traditional cut-points for sedentary time and light-intensity activity.

40|$|Background: Sit-stand {{workstations}} {{have been}} identified as a strategy to reduce sedentary behaviours in the workplace and may mitigate musculoskeletal symptoms by allowing positional change between sitting and standing. Aim: The aim was to investigate the effect of a sit-stand workstation on <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> in the workplace. Changes in <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> were examined to determine the responsiveness of musculoskeletal symptoms to increased standing in sedentary office workers. Design: Two phase single-case series design Methods: Participants were measured throughout baseline and intervention phases, with the introduction of standing during the intervention phase. Sitting and <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> was objectively monitored through use of a personal inclinometer, in addition to self-reported measures of musculoskeletal discomfort by location, frequency and severity, matched to participant symptoms. Results: Six symptomatic participants (male n= 3, female n= 3, age range 25 to 38 years) employed full-time in sedentary occupations were recruited. A reduction in sitting time was observed for three participants, ranging from 15 min/day to 78 min/day. Sitting time was almost exclusively replaced with standing. Musculoskeletal symptoms improved in Troublesomeness and frequency of episodes with at least one area of discomfort reverting to no symptoms for each participant during the intervention phase. However, in general, changes to musculoskeletal symptoms did not exceed the smallest worthwhile change. Conclusion: Changes in objectively measured sitting and <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> were small; therefore, results of reduced discomfort during the intervention phase should be interpreted cautiously.

Headspace equilibration treatments varied helium (He) :water ratio, shaking time and <b>standing</b> <b>time.</b> Mean groundwater N 2 O, CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations were 0. 024 mg N L− 1, 13. 71 mg C L− 1 and 1. 63 μg C L− 1, respectively. All treatments were found to significantly influence dissolved gas concentrations. Considerable differences in the optimal He:water ratio and <b>standing</b> <b>time</b> were observed between the three gases.
