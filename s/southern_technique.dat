40|$|The {{occurrence}} of the copia transposable element in 18 species of the repleta group of Drosophila has been studied using the <b>Southern</b> <b>technique.</b> The homologous sequence of copia was detected, either with radioactive or non-radioactive nucleic acid detection systems, as a pattern of multiple bands in species of the mercatorum and mulleri subgroups. Nevertheless, this sequence was not detected in the hydei subgroup. The intraspecific polymorphism {{in the pattern of}} bands indicates that this sequence is likely to be mobile. Some of the results could suggest the existence of restriction polymorphism of the copia homologous sequence in D koepferae populations. The partial sequencing of two independent clones isolated from D buzzatii clearly establishes that these elements are related and are likely to be the same...|$|E
40|$|DNAs {{extracted}} from peripheral blood leukocytes of 24 individuals, selected for their HLA-DR types, -DR 2, -DR 5, and -DRw 6, were analyzed with four restriction enzymes, BamHI, EcoRV, HindIII, and Taq I, using the <b>Southern</b> <b>technique.</b> This panel includes 16 individuals with homozygous typing cells and 8 heterozygous individuals who carry rare Dw subtypes or unusual DR-DQ associations. Eighty-five polymorphic fragments were detected and {{assigned to the}} DR or DQ gene families according to their hybridization signals. Thirty-eight fragments (DR or DQ) were found to correlate with single DR or Dw specificities or rare associations such as DRw 14 -DQw 3. Forty-two fragments correlated with the association of immunologically defined specificities. In total, these 85 fragments constituted 44 different patterns, each comprising 1 - 9 fragments. For each homozygous typing cell a combination of patterns was observed. Fourteen different combinations of 10 - 20 patterns were found among the 16 individuals with homozygous typing cells, showing that Dw 18, Dw 19, Dw 9, and Dw 5 are heterogeneous at the genomic level whereas only the Dw 2 individuals tested here are identical...|$|E

40|$|DNA length {{polymorphism}} in the 5 '-flanking {{region of}} the human insulin gene has been reported by Bell et al. (1981), Rotwein et al. (1981), and Owerbach and Nerup (1982). Bgl I digestions of human DNA that have been hybridized to an insulin probe using the <b>Southern</b> <b>technique</b> shows {{that there are two}} distinct groups of 5 '-flanking lengths: one being shorter than 3. 6 kilobases (kb) and the other being longer than 4. 3 kb. The insulin genes with the former length are denoted as A 1, and those with the latter as A 2. Using these data and demographic data of diabetes, it is estimated that, when the fitness of A 1 A 2 individual was taken as unity, the amounts of fitness reduction for A 1 A 1 was 6. 5 X 10 (- 6) and that for A 2 A 2 was - 5. 6 X 10 (- 6). Because of these small magnitudes of selection, the changes in population incidences of insulin-dependent diabetes and noninsulin-dependent diabetes are not affected much by the polymorphism in the 5 '-flanking {{region of the}} insulin gene...|$|E
40|$|There is accumulating {{evidence}} to support that genes on chromosome 21 {{play an important role}} in the development of pathologies associated with leukemia, Down 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome, and Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease. We have previously described erg, a human gene related to the ets oncogene. In this study, we have regionally assigned the erg gene to chromosome 21 q 22. 3 by using somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization analysis. In light of this chromosome assignment, the relationship of erg to the 21 q translocation breakpoint characteristic of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) was considered. By using a DNA probe that is specific for the erg gene, a panel of rodent-human cell hybrids was analyzed by the <b>Southern</b> <b>technique</b> to study specific chromosome translocations occurring in acute myeloblastic leukemia. The erg gene was found to translocate from chromosome 21 to 8 in the t(8; 21) (q 22; q 22), a non-random translocation found in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia of the subgroup M 2 (AML-M 2). The localization of the erg gene to chromosome 21 q 22 raises the possibility that this gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of AML-M 2...|$|E
40|$|Infection of {{secondary}} human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells with human papovavirus BK (BKV) resulted in cellular lysis and degeneration within 7 days. After 30 days, multilayered colonies of transformed cells were found and subcultured for analyses. These BK-HEK cells uniformly expressed the BKV T-antigen but were only 1 % V-antigen positive. They produced infectious virus and were resistant to superinfection by BKV. They reached a saturation density of 1. 3 x 10 (5) cells per cm 2 in medium with 5 % fetal calf serum, {{were able to}} grow in medium containing 2 % serum, and did not form colonies in soft agar or tumors in nude mice. Nonintegrated, superhelical BKV DNA was detected in the noncloned cells as expected because they were persistently infected and contained RNA transcripts complementary to both early and late regions of the BKV genome. Analysis of T-antigen-positive clonal isolates of these BK-HEK cells by the <b>Southern</b> <b>technique</b> revealed an absence of free viral DNA and the presencce of integrated BKV DNA sequences corresponding to the early region of the BKV genome. These studies demonstrate the stable transformation of human cells by BKV. However, the transformed human cells which retain and express part of the BKV genome do not fully manifest the growth properties of other papovarirus-transformed cells...|$|E

Naturally occurring {{variations in the}} nucleotide sequence of DNA (DNA sequence polymorphisms) result in genetic differences between people. The <b>Southern</b> blot <b>technique</b> can reveal characteristic DNA banding patterns at a specific genetic locus. The polymorphic DNA banding patterns at several genetic loci can be combined to help construct individual DNA "fingerprints". Such fingerprints can resolve identity in criminal and paternity cases. The appropriate technology is being used in North American law enforcement agency laboratories.

40|$|Double-stranded cDNA {{synthesized}} from total poly(A) -containing mRNA, {{extracted from}} monkey cells infected with measles virus, has been inserted into Pst cleavage site of Escherichia coli plasmid pBR 322 and cloned. A clone containing measles virus DNA sequences was identified by hybridization to a measles virus-specific 32 P-labeled cDNA probe prepared from the mRNA of measles virus-infected cells. Cellular sequences in the probe were neutralized by prehybridization with {{an excess of}} unlabeled mRNA from uninfected monkey cells. The insert of cloned cDNA isolated contans 1420 base pairs, as shown by agarose gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. The size of the mRNA complementary to this cloned cDNA is 1750 nucleotides, {{as determined by the}} reverse <b>Southern</b> <b>technique.</b> The cloned DNA fragment was further identified as the reverse transcript of the mRNA coding for the nucleocapsid protein of measles virus on the basis that the major cell-free translation product of mRNA selected by hybridization to the cloned DNA comigrated with the nucleocapsid protein and was immunoprecipitated by measles virus-specific antibodies. Subsequently, the cloned DNA was used to detect specific measles virus sequences in the poly(A) -RNA extracted from brain autopsy material from a patient with subacute sclerosing panecephalitis. The cloned DNA can thus be used as a probe to study the structure and expression of the measles genome, and in particular, to study diseases of the central nervous system in which persistent infection with measles virus has been implicated...|$|E
40|$|Our {{discovery}} of human papillomavirus type 47 (HPV 47) in benign lesions {{from a patient}} suffering from epidermodysplasia verruciformis prompted us to examine whether the viral DNA also resided in malignant lesions from the same patient. By using newly devised protocols for amplifying a group of epidermodysplasia verruciformis-associated HPV DNAs by PCR and differentially identifying them by reverse-phase dot blot hybridization, we demonstrated that HPV 47 DNA, but not other HPV DNAs of the group, was abundant (about 10 (3) copies per diploid amount of cell DNA) in DNAs prepared from three carcinomas. Using DNA from one of these carcinomas, we also confirmed that DNA of HPV 5, HPV 14, or HPV 21, detected in significant amounts in DNAs from benign lesions from the patient, were present only in negligible amounts or not at all. The results suggest the involvement of HPV 47 DNA in tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we demonstrated by the <b>Southern</b> <b>technique</b> that most, if not all, of the HPV 47 DNA consists of either a unit (or a nongrossly deleted unit) length of the viral genome carrying no (or no gross) internal rearrangements or tandem repeats. This and other results obtained by this technique indicated that {{a considerable amount of}} the viral DNA resides as a circular monomer a unit length of the viral genome in carcinoma cells, while the remainder reside as catenanes, concatemers, or both. The concatemers were considered more likely to be replicated without integration into cellular DNA than to be integrated, because no bands for the corresponding fragments including integration sites were detected by treatment with restriction enzymes that would have produced such fragments...|$|E
40|$|Human retroviruses have {{recently}} been linked with T cell lymphoproliferative disorders and with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. We investigated the mechanisms for acquired pure red cell aplasia and cutaneous anergy in a patient with the chronic T gamma-lymphoproliferative disease (T gamma-LPD) syndrome. Patient marrow erythroid progenitors (BFU-E) were 17 +/- 9 % of control and were selectively increased to 88 - 102 % of control after marrow T cell depletion. Patient Leu 2 + suppressor T cells spontaneously produced high titers of human gamma-interferon and resulted in a concentration-dependent selective inhibition (74 - 91 %) of BFU-E when co-cultured with autologous or allogeneic marrow. Conditioned media (CM) derived from patient Leu 2 + T cells similarly inhibited growth of autologous or allogeneic marrow BFU-E. The inhibitory factor derived from patient CM was acid-labile (pH 2) and sensitive to trypsin; prior treatment of patient T cells with anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody plus complement abrogated the suppressive effect of T cell-derived CM. Patient {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC) were unable to support growth of cultured interleukin 2 (IL 2) -dependent T cells, but responded to exogenous IL 2 in vitro with a 16 - 21 -fold augmentation, relative to control, in mitogen-induced proliferation. Antibodies to HTLV-I core proteins p 19 and p 24 but not to HTLV-III proteins were detected in patient serum by Western blotting; patient cultured PBMC stained (7 - 11 %) with antibodies to p 19 and p 24. Patient cultured PBMC demonstrated integrated HTLV-I genomic sequences by the <b>Southern</b> <b>technique</b> and expressed both specific HTLV-I genomic sequences by RNA dot blot plus reverse transcriptase activity. Utilizing a cloned DNA probe for the beta chain of the T cell receptor gene, patient PMBC demonstrated gene rearrangements providing presumptive evidence for clonality. The presence in serum of HTLV-I p 19 and p 24 antibodies, the expression of p 19 and p 24 core antigens on patient mononuclear cells, the evidence of HTLV-I proviral integration sequences and the expression of HTLV-I genomic sequences in patient cells, indicates infection with HTLV-I and raises the possibility of an etiologic link between human retrovirus infection and some instances of large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T gamma-LPD) ...|$|E

Eighteen of the patients were HBeAb-positive, 12 were HBeAg-positive and one case had neither marker. Serial specimens were obtained from 16 cases over 5 - 42 weeks, while the patients were treated with recombinant leukocyte A interferom (rIFN-A) or adriamycin. Seven patients (2 HBeAg-positive, 5 HBeAb-positive) were positive for HBV DNA. In two patients HBV DNA and HBV DNA polymerase (DNAp) appeared in serum weeks after rIFN-A or adriamycin treatment was started. In two other cases, HBV DNA that was initially present disappeared during rIFN-A treatment. In a fifth patient HBV DNA persisting after adriamycin treatment diminished after change of treatment to rIFN-A. With one possible exception the HBV DNA detectable by <b>Southern</b> blot <b>technique</b> was composed chiefly of sequences 2. 2 - 3. 2 kb size indicating the presence of unintegrated DNA forms.
