The factory was located {{on the third floor of}} a four-story building, which also featured residential units. Investigators determined that the first and second floors of the structure housed additional illegal factories. The factory destroyed in the fire was found to be owned and operated by Tenex Exports, and all of the people who were killed or injured in the fire slept in the factory at night, a <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not considered unusual in India. There was had just one emergency exit, and 40 workers were housed in the structure at the time of the fire, and the owner had locked the factory at night to prevent workers from running away with leather goods. The building was located in the Tannix International, Topsia, in the South 24 Parganas district of Greater Kolkata region.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{there is}} a range of ulterior motives for Israel's denial of Palestinian statehood. If Palestine were {{declared}} a state, then immediately, Israel, by its present occupation of the West Bank will be in breach of the United Nations Charter. Palestine, as a state, could legitimately call upon the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense under Article 51 of the Charter to remove Israel from the occupied territories. Palestine, as a state, {{would be able to}} accede to international conventions and bring legal action against Israel on various matters. Palestine could accede to various international human rights instruments, such as the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It could even join the International Criminal Court and file cases against Israel for war crimes.

500|$|The character, of Turkish descent, is {{described}} as being [...] "torn between two worlds", which Hussen explained are her traditional family life and modern London life. Naz is a family girl who has reached a point in her life where she wants to have fun, but is also a daddy's girl, the apple of her father's eye. He sees her as a perfect student. She has {{a good relationship with}} her parents and is respectful of them, doing what they want, even though they do not know her very well. She loves her family but they do not understand her or what she wants. Hussen opined that Naz would be a good girl if her family did understand her more. What Naz wants is to be like everyone around her {{and to be able to}} pick her own boyfriend, but being from a Muslim family means she is unable to. She tries to keep each side of her life secret from the other, but more of each side is seen as the series goes on, and they eventually meet, leading to bad consequences. Hussen opined that this is a common real-life <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> rarely portrayed on television, so girls would be able relate to the character. Naz likes to make everyone happy but ultimately is more likely to think about her own happiness; she likes to get her own way.|$|E
500|$|Well-known {{newspapers}} include The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and USA Today. Although {{the cost}} of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have [...] "alternative weeklies" [...] to complement the mainstream daily papers, for example, New York City's The Village Voice or Los Angeles' LA Weekly, to name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups. Early versions of the American newspaper comic strip and the American comic book began appearing in the 19th century. In 1938, Superman, the comic book superhero of DC Comics, developed into an American icon. Aside from web portals and search engines, the most popular websites are Facebook, YouTube, Wikipedia, Yahoo!, eBay, Amazon, and Twitter.|$|E
500|$|... "Roadrunners" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named the episode the [...] "finest stand-alone episode" [...] of the show's eighth season. Harrisson praised the character development in [...] "Roadrunners" [...] {{and noted that}} the episode [...] "effectively brings [...] together as partners." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two note that, [...] "for the first half-hour, this works as a slow burn horror story... It's the transition of Gillian Anderson's performance from wry exasperation to outright paranoia... which makes this so effective." [...] Shearman and Pearson did, however, slightly criticize the cutting of John Doggett's role to a minimum. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "A–" [...] and wrote that it [...] "is an episode that’s dedicated to helping us move past the Mulder era." [...] He praised the creepiness of Gilligan's script, {{as well as the}} characterization of Scully, writing that even though she is in a <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> over her head, she is still smart in her attempts to escape; he also praised Anderson's acting. However, VanDerWerff was more critical of the final scene, noting that it made Doggett come across as [...] "kind of an asshole". Paul Spragg of Xposé wrote positively of the episode, saying it features a [...] "return to the body horror stories that had worked so well in the early seasons". Spragg added that [...] "Roadrunners" [...] is [...] "certainly close" [...] to the highly acclaimed first-season episode [...] "Ice".|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, Furr and Funder (2004) made a {{distinction}} between objectively similar situations and subjectively similar <b>situations.</b> They noted <b>that</b> <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> objectively similar are identical and can be experimentally manipulated or defined. Conversely, <b>situations</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> subjectively similar are based on perceptions or experiences that lead an individual to believe <b>that</b> the two <b>situations</b> <b>are</b> similar.

The exploded logit model is the product of standard logit models with the choice set decreasing as each alternative is ranked and leaves the set of available choices in the subsequent choice.|$|E

2500|$|Anxiety is {{an emotion}} {{characterized}} by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil, often accompanied by nervous behavior, such as pacing back and forth, somatic complaints, and rumination.

Anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness and worry, usually generalized and unfocused as an overreaction to a <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> only subjectively seen as menacing. It is often accompanied by muscular tension, restlessness, fatigue and problems in concentration.
