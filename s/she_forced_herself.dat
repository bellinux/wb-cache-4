60|$|She said no more. The still pause lengthened. <b>She</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> to {{meet his}} eyes.|$|E
60|$|Later on, <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> {{to speak}} again, {{and asked the}} old man his name.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> to {{look into}} his face, and started to find his eyes so terribly penetrating.|$|E
50|$|Yet <b>she</b> <b>forces</b> <b>herself</b> to do so.|$|R
50|$|Miranti (Jenny Rachman) is left a widow {{after her}} pilot husband dies in an accident. <b>She</b> <b>forces</b> <b>herself</b> to work independently, despite feeling alienated. She soon learns that her {{brother-in-law}} Dimas (Roy Marten) cares greatly for her. Miranti ultimately realises that his feelings {{are more than}} just pity, and the two can unite.|$|R
50|$|The {{story begins}} with Alicia Donadio {{birthing}} and then burying her stillborn child. Alicia was raped during {{the events of}} The Twelve and became pregnant. After soul searching {{for a period of}} about 2 years and mourning, <b>she</b> <b>forces</b> <b>herself</b> out of her stupor and fashions a sword to hunt down Zero.|$|R
60|$|The telephone-bell, tinkling sharply, rescued Sally {{from the}} {{necessity}} of a reply. <b>She</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> across the room to answer it.|$|E
60|$|She {{had been}} making little efforts as if to rise; now <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> to her feet, and ran from the room.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> {{to speak}} through lips {{suddenly}} pale. What strange words they sounded, frozen things, scarcely audible! Yet the effort hurt her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>She's</b> <b>forcing</b> <b>herself</b> to it, poor dear little thing; and you've no notion what she's suffering. I {{was never}} much for {{religion}} nor against it, but it can't be right {{to let her}} do this, and you ought to persuade her out of it. Of course everybody will say {{it was very good}} and forgiving of 'ee to take her to 'ee again. But for my part I don't." ...|$|R
5000|$|Throughout {{the book}} {{it seems as}} though Helen and Giles Carnaby, the lawyer, will end up in a happy relationship. This does not happen, as Giles turns out to be {{something}} of a philanderer; but the relationship seems beneficial to Helen as <b>she</b> <b>forces</b> <b>herself</b> to {{take an active role in}} breaking it off, rather than letting events take their course passively as when her mother was alive, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the midst}} of so much chatter, Sire?" [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>forcing</b> <b>herself</b> to smile gaily. [...] "Nay, but 'tis a serious matter--and I must consult with my father." ...|$|R
6000|$|One bitter drop always marred the {{pleasure}} of that hour; for when she had asked for Mrs. Sterling, and sent her love, <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> to say kindly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What can I tell you?" [...] Helen reflected, {{speaking}} more {{to herself}} in a rambling style than as a prophetess delivering a message. <b>She</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> to speak.|$|E
6000|$|... "I should like," [...] she began, and hesitated quite a {{long time}} before <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> to add, with a change of voice, [...] "to study mathematics--to know about the stars." ...|$|E
5000|$|Hollie Meyer as [...] "Baby" [...] and [...] "Toula's gang". A stereotypical [...] "fat chick" [...] {{who is one}} of Toula's girls. <b>She</b> <b>forces</b> <b>herself</b> on DJ BJ {{who becomes}} her boyfriend and she is not shy to push her weight around. She is the butt of the fat jokes and happy to retaliate violently when ridiculed. Hollie also played a variety of other roles {{including}} Toula's double in series 5, the Ghost, and [...] "Voula" [...] in the 'Italy' episode, season 4.|$|R
5000|$|The {{lives of}} the two couples cross when Edward invites Maya to sing at the hotel. Soon jealous of the girl, Nduesoh directs her {{repressed}} anger and emotion towards Omoniyi, on whom <b>she</b> <b>forces</b> <b>herself</b> as he cleans her penthouse suite. [...] Omoniyi later learns of Edward’s attention toward Maya, and conspires with Nduesoh in a plot to stalk her husband. Owing a favor to an old friend, Omoniyi enlists the aid of Ade (also known as [...] "Scorpion"), a local thug, to follow Edward’s every move.|$|R
60|$|So, {{when the}} morning {{came of age}} {{and it was time}} to rise, by no action, look, or sign, did she betray the {{presence}} of the unusual in her soul. If this which was before her must be done, it would be carried out as though it were of no import, as though it were a daily action; nor did <b>she</b> <b>force</b> <b>herself</b> to quietude, or pride herself thereon, but acted thus from instinct, the instinct for avoiding fuss and unnecessary suffering that was bred in her.|$|R
60|$|But Lucy {{would not}} allow herself, even for a moment, to doubt her father. Now that {{she thought of the}} matter, she saw that it was absurd. <b>She</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> to give a laugh.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young lady}} laughed again, {{but she did}} not say {{anything}} further, and a space of silence fell so long that by-and-by <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> to say, [...] "My cousin findeth not the ball presently." ...|$|E
60|$|From {{this day}} <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> to take pains to avoid him--never {{allowing}} herself, as formerly, to remain long in his company, {{even if their}} juxtaposition were purely accidental. She gave the other three every chance.|$|E
6000|$|An unwonted {{resolution}} {{came into}} her face. Her lips whitened. [...] "Don't you know, Rag," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>forcing</b> <b>herself</b> to speak----"Don't you guess? You don't know half! In that bureau there----In there! It's stuffed with bills. Unpaid bills." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{seemed about}} to go on, but she stopped, and again he waited. At length <b>she</b> seemed to <b>force</b> <b>herself</b> to speak.|$|R
5000|$|Her {{off-screen}} {{life and}} personality {{during those years}} was quite different from what audiences assumed. She {{spent much of her}} time feeling lonely and homesick. She might swim at her agent's pool, but shunned the beaches and staring crowds. When asked for an autograph, she wondered why anyone would want it. Writer Howard Sharpe interviewed her and gave his impression: Hedy has the most incredible personal sophistication. She knows the peculiarly European art of being womanly; she knows what men want in a beautiful woman, what attracts them; and <b>she</b> <b>forces</b> <b>herself</b> to be these things. She has magnetism with warmth, something that neither Dietrich nor Garbo has managed to achieve.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{you think}} you can help us with the concert," [...] <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> to say. Oh, if only Irene would stop looking at that boot! Rilla could just hear her giving Olive Kirk an account of it.|$|E
60|$|They did not answer, but stopped, {{and she sat}} on {{a boulder}} by the wayside. They stood {{motionless}} in front of her, waiting patiently till she was ready. After a little while <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> to get up.|$|E
60|$|Anne had {{an uncomfortable}} {{conviction}} that Mr. Harrison was right, and <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> to expunge {{most of her}} beloved descriptions, though it took three re-writings before the story could be pruned down to please the fastidious Mr. Harrison.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But I {{must go to}} Mary!' cried Louis, {{as though}} {{reproaching}} himself for the delay. 'Oh! that <b>she</b> should have <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> to that wedding, and spared me!' ...|$|R
60|$|Lady Underhill {{wrestled}} with herself. She {{was a woman}} of great will-power and accustomed to triumph over the weaknesses of the flesh. After a while her eyes opened. <b>She</b> had <b>forced</b> <b>herself,</b> against the evidence of her senses, to recognize {{that this was a}} platform on which she stood and not a deck.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Lamar, who {{previously}} turned down Junkyard Sal's invitation for sex, gets {{called to her}} office where she meets him in her underwear. She locks him inside and threatens to fire him {{if he does not}} succumb to her. Lamar, who we are told needs money for correspondent school, lies down on her bed. <b>She</b> <b>forces</b> <b>herself</b> on him in numerous sexual positions. After a while, she lets Lamar have anal sex with her and gives in when a suddenly enthusiastic Lamar stops her from continuing into other positions. Lamar then spots fellow employees peeping from the window. He breaks open the door and beats them up. Junkyard Sal then fires the peepers and Lamar for being [...] "perverts".|$|R
60|$|He {{caught her}} in his arms, and kissed her, in the first rapture of {{receiving}} that welcome news. <b>She</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> away from him without answering a word. She turned her poor blind face round and round, {{in the search for}} me.|$|E
6000|$|He durst not glance towards her, or {{he would}} have seen her cheek white as wax, and her eye seeking his in dismayed inquiry. There was a pause; then <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> to falter--'Yes. I suppose it is very right--very grand. It is settled?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And why not? What can he {{possibly}} {{have learned to}} your injury?" [...] And then as it seemed to Lady Mason that Mr. Furnival expected some reply to this question, <b>she</b> <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> to give him one. [...] "I suppose that he cannot know anything." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{theme of}} choice is evident through the {{characters}} of Leonardo, the bride, and the bridegroom. The bride is very conflicted because <b>she</b> <b>forces</b> <b>herself</b> to marry the bridegroom, when in reality she is {{still in love with}} Leonardo. Leonardo, despite being married, is also still madly in love with the bride. Their combined choice to run away with each other after the marriage is one that manifests their latent and pent up desires left over from their previous relationship. The bridegroom is in love with his bride-to-be, however. Despite the fact that she lives in a cave located hours away, the bridegroom still loves the bride and takes her as the woman he wants to remain with for the remainder of his life.|$|R
50|$|Williams writes from {{personal}} experience, {{and many of}} her songs are based on people she grew up with. <b>She</b> doesn't <b>force</b> <b>herself</b> to write, which is an approach she learned in college when she decided that whatever she could do {{at any given time}} was enough. She prides herself on having songs that all came from some kind of inspiration.|$|R
2500|$|Alisa is a half-blood witch {{with the}} powers of a full-blood witch. Initially, {{she was afraid of}} Wicca, but when she finds out she is part witch, <b>she</b> <b>forces</b> <b>herself</b> to confront her powers. She finds her mother's Book of Shadows after Morgan {{receives}} it from the owner of the store [...] "Practical Magick". Within the Book of Shadows, Alisa finds out that her mother, Sarah Curtis, had stripped herself of her powers in fear of them, which inadvertently resulted in Alisa inheriting those powers. It turns out that in Alisa's family, the firstborn female is cursed with uncontrollable telekinesis. Alisa also possesses this power and, as it is later revealed, so does her grandmother. Alisa meets her mother's family later in the series and even receives her mother's tools from her grandmother.|$|R
