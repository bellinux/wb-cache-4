5|$|The sebaceous glands {{are found}} {{throughout}} {{all areas of}} the skin except the palms of the hands and <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> the feet. There are two types of sebaceous gland, those connected to hair follicles, in pilosebaceous units, and those that exist independently.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands are {{microscopic}} exocrine glands in {{the skin}} that secrete an oily or waxy matter, called sebum, to lubricate and waterproof the skin and hair of mammals. In humans, they occur in the greatest number on the face and scalp, but also on {{all parts of the}} skin except the palms of the hands and <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> the feet. The type of secretion of the sebaceous glands is referred to as holocrine.|$|E

5|$|The croupade and {{ballotade}} are predecessors to the capriole. In the croupade, {{the horse}} jumps with both fore and hind legs remaining tucked under {{the body and}} he does not kick out. In the ballotade, the horse jumps and untucks his hind legs slightly, he does not kick out, but the <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> the hind feet are visible if viewed from the rear.|$|E
5|$|Through his {{military}} reforms, which included consolidating or disbanding units of questionable loyalty, Augustus changed and regularized the legion, {{down to the}} hobnail pattern on the <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> army boots. A legion was organized into ten cohorts, each of which comprised six centuries, with a century further made up of ten squads (contubernia); the exact size of the Imperial legion, which {{is most likely to}} have been determined by logistics, has been estimated to range from 4,800 to 5,280.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{smallpox}} generally {{produced a}} discrete rash, {{in which the}} pustules stood out on the skin separately. The distribution of the rash was densest on the face; denser on the extremities than on the trunk; and on the extremities, denser on the distal parts than on the proximal. The palms of the hands and <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> the feet {{were involved in the}} majority of cases. Sometimes, the blisters merged into sheets, forming a confluent rash, which began to detach the outer layers of skin from the underlying flesh. Patients with confluent smallpox often remained ill even after scabs have formed over all the lesions. In one case series, the case-fatality rate in confluent smallpox was 62 percent.|$|E

5|$|Several of the animal's {{physical}} features are adaptions to climbing through trees. It uses its tail to assist balance and has semi-retractable claws that it uses to climb trees in its search for prey. It has semiplantigrade feet, switching between a plantigrade-like gait (when arboreal) and a digitigrade-like one (when terrestrial). The <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> its paws are nearly bare {{and covered with}} strong pads. The fossa has very flexible ankles that allow it to readily grasp tree trunks so as to climb up or down trees head first or to leap to another tree. Captive juveniles {{have been known to}} swing upside down by their hindfeet from knotted ropes.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} show {{a famous}} incident {{from the life}} of Saint Francis of Assisi, who is shown kneeling by a rock as he receives the stigmata of the crucified Christ on the palms of his hands and <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> his feet. Behind him are rock formations, shown in great detail, and a panoramic landscape that seems to relegate the figures to secondary importance. This treatment of Francis is the first such to appear in northern Renaissance art. The arguments attributing the works to van Eyck are circumstantial and based mainly on the style and quality of the panels. A later, third version is in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, but is weaker and strays significantly in tone and design.|$|E
5|$|Filming the pre-title {{sequence}} {{went through}} some alterations. One {{of the scenes}} saw Johnny being foot whipped, however the shot where the stick struck the <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> the feet was cut out due to its brutality. Also, when discussing how Johnny would be expelled from the mosque afterwards, Nalluri suggested using the idea where he is thrown {{to the top of}} the surveillance van, which would give the audience the impression that the antagonists were on to them. Later on in the episode, Nalluri wanted to include some exposition shots, which shows Khaldun's actions while he narrates them to MI5. In one scene, Tom observes Khaldun inside a prison cell by opening a slide view at the prison door. However one had to be made because no such doors exist in the United Kingdom. Following the broadcast of the episode, the producers were surprised to hear that the BBC were unhappy with a scene showing Harry holding a Costa Coffee cup, as the corporation believed it was done out of product placement. They were also surprised to learn that they did not take notice in a scene with Malcolm Wynn-Jones delightfully eating a piece of chocolate from a Black Magic chocolate box, which they thought was a more obvious example. Portraying actor Hugh Simon had to spit out the chocolate after the take as he disliked the confectionery.|$|E

5|$|Most mammals have agouti hair, {{with each}} {{individual}} hair shaft having bands of colour corresponding to {{two different types}} of melanin pigment. Bears however have a single type of melanin and the hairs have a single colour throughout their length, apart from the tip which is sometimes a different shade. The coat consists of long guard hairs, which form a protective shaggy covering, and short dense hairs which form an insulating layer trapping air close to the skin. The shaggy coat helps maintain body heat during winter hibernation and is shed in the spring leaving a shorter summer coat. Polar bears have hollow, translucent guard hairs which gain heat from the sun and conduct it to the dark-coloured skin below. They have a thick layer of blubber for extra insulation, and the <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> their feet have a dense pad of fur. Other than the bold black-and-white pelage of the panda, bears tend to be uniform in colour, although some species may have markings on the chest or face.|$|E
5|$|Patching was one {{of several}} backstrokers who had slipped on the {{starting}} area earlier in the meet, so Kerry decided to rub a sticky red substance onto the <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> his feet. The Soviet organisers had provided a carpet following the incidents, resulting in Kerry leaving red footprints in the stadium. Kerry led off in a time faster than his effort in the individual event, but it was still two seconds slower than his personal best. He finished his leg in 57.87s, leaving Australia in fourth place. Kuznetsov gave the Soviets the lead after posting a time of 56.81s, with Hungary and Great Britain in second and third place. France was the last to reach the 100m mark, recording a time of 58.84s. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s, the fastest split among the breaststrokers by 0.63s. His leg moved Australia into second place at the halfway mark, just 0.45s behind the hosts and roughly half a second ahead of the British and the Hungarians. The four leading teams had broken away, leaving a two-second gap back to the fifth-placed East Germans.|$|E
5|$|As Patching {{had slipped}} {{earlier in the}} meet, Kerry decided to rub a sticky red {{substance}} onto the <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> his feet. The Soviet hosts had installed a carpet following the incidents, resulting in Kerry leaving red footprints in the stadium. Kerry led off in a time faster than his effort in the individual event, {{but it was still}} two seconds slower than his personal best time of 57.87s, leaving Australia in fourth place {{at the end of the}} first leg. Evans then swam a personal best of 63.01s, drawing Australia almost level with the host nation at the halfway mark. Tonelli swam his leg in 54.94s, almost two seconds faster than he had done over the distance. Tonelli did so with an uneven arm technique due to the uneven strength in his arms. He began to lose ground in the last 50m and was a bodylength behind until a late surge brought him to within a metre by the end of his leg. Brooks then executed a powerful, well-timed dive and surfaced almost even with his Soviet counterpart. He had drawn level by the halfway mark and made a superior turn to take the lead. The Soviet freestyler pulled level at the 25m mark before Brooks again sprinted away to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his teammates. The time of 3m 45.70s sealed Australia's first ever win in a medley relay at the Olympics, for men or women. The team then made a celebratory dive into the pool and were interviewed poolside. In 2000, Kerry and the other members of the quartet were each awarded the Australian Sports Medal for their victory in Moscow.|$|E

Decorative red yarn is worked into the sole seam around the toe and heel. In the past, boots used for dancing were also used as winter boot. The leg section was made from young caibou-leg skins and the soles were made from depilated skin of bearded seal. Today many dances are held indoors, so some women make the <b>soles</b> <b>of</b> their dance boots with lighter-weight materials sucj as ringed seal. Moose-leg skins are used when they are available. Commercially tanned calfskin is used by contemporary seamstresses.|$|E
