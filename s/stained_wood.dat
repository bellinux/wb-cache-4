2500|$|Entrance to {{the first}} floor {{assembly}} hall, called the [...] "Great Hall", was through two large double doors at the east end of the vestibule. The Great Hall occupied the remainder of the floor space East of the vestibule. The room was flanked on either side by seven large, arched windows, with four similar windows along the east wall.

25|$|The bleaches used {{to remove}} {{unwanted}} fungal <b>stains</b> from <b>wood</b> include two-part peroxide bleach and solutions of sodium hypochlorite.

Two doors, one on the north wall and another on the south, opened to the landing of two spiral staircases, one in the northwest corner and the other in the southwest corner, which led to the attic. These were the only access points {{to the rest of the}} building. The room was flanked on either side by seven large, arched windows, with four similar windows along the east wall.

50|$|In furniture-making, ammonia {{solution}} was traditionally used to darken or <b>stain</b> <b>wood</b> containing tannic acid. After being sealed inside a container with the wood, fumes from the solution react with the tannic acid and iron salts naturally found in wood, creating a rich, dark stained {{look to the}} wood. This was commonly used during {{the arts and crafts}} movement in furniture- a furniture style which was primarily constructed of oak and stained using these methods.|$|R

60|$|He {{recalled}} his own equivocal position in Belvedere, a free boy, a leader afraid {{of his own}} authority, proud and sensitive and suspicious, battling against the squalor {{of his life and}} against the riot of his mind. The letters cut in the <b>stained</b> <b>wood</b> of the desk stared upon him, mocking his bodily weakness and futile enthusiasms and making him loathe himself for his own mad and filthy orgies. The spittle in his throat grew bitter and foul to swallow and the faint sickness climbed to his brain so that for a moment {{he closed his eyes and}} walked on in darkness.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a low}} wainscoted room, with a {{very wide}} window divided into three by mullions, and fitted with {{latticed}} panes. They were open, and a delicious scent of flowers {{came in from the}} garden. The furniture was all new and very strong, of dark <b>stained</b> <b>wood,</b> which harmonized well with the paneling. There were no window curtains, but a valance of white dimity hung above the window. There was a piece of carpet between the beds; the rest of the floor was bare, but the boards were of old oak, and looked as well without it. Several rows of pegs had been put upon the walls, and there was a small chest of drawers by each bed.|$|E
60|$|It was of {{the usual}} type of such room--of good size but bare, with bee's-waxed flooring, plainly frescoed walls, and a ceiling colored gray and bordered with painted arabesques. Two or three small rugs {{relieved}} the bareness of the floor. An oval table on very thin legs stood in the middle; the chairs and couch {{seemed to have been}} made to match it, and had an eminently bare and uncomfortable appearance; a vase of flowers stood on a spindle-legged little table {{in front of one of}} the windows which opened down to the ground. Some colored prints in frames of <b>stained</b> <b>wood</b> hung on the walls, and some skimpy curtains draped the windows.|$|E

60|$|They {{passed into}} the anatomy theatre where Mr Dedalus, the porter aiding him, searched the desks for his initials. Stephen {{remained}} in the background, depressed more than ever by the darkness and silence of the theatre and by the air it wore of jaded and formal study. On the desk he read the word FOETUS cut {{several times in the}} dark <b>stained</b> <b>wood.</b> The sudden legend startled his blood: he seemed to feel the absent students of the college about him and to shrink from their company. A vision of their life, which his father's words had been powerless to evoke, sprang up before him out of the word cut in the desk. A broad-shouldered student with a moustache was cutting in the letters with a jack-knife, seriously. Other students stood or sat near him laughing at his handiwork. One jogged his elbow. The big student turned on him, frowning. He was dressed in loose grey clothes and had tan boots.|$|E
6000|$|When I {{think of}} how such things began in my mind, there comes back to me the memory of an {{enormous}} bleak room with its ceiling going up to heaven and its floor covered irregularly with patched and defective oilcloth and a dingy mat or so and a [...] "surround" [...] as they call it, of dark <b>stained</b> <b>wood.</b> Here and there against the wall are trunks and boxes. There are cupboards {{on either side of}} the fireplace and bookshelves with books above them, and on the wall and rather tattered is a large yellow-varnished geological map of the South of England. Over the mantel is a huge lump of white coral rock and several big fossil bones, and above that hangs the portrait of a brainy gentleman, sliced in half and displaying an interior of intricate detail and much vigour of coloring. It is the floor I think of chiefly; over the oilcloth of which, assumed to be land, spread towns and villages and forts of wooden bricks; there are steep square hills (geologically, volumes of Orr's CYCLOPAEDIA OF THE SCIENCES) and the cracks and spaces of the floor and the bare brown surround were the water channels and open sea of that continent of mine.|$|E
60|$|The house {{upon which}} the story was thus centred, and where it was written, had been a farm-house, bought {{and for a time}} {{occupied}} by Hawthorne previous to his departure for Europe. On coming back to it, he made some additions to the old wooden structure, and caused to be built a low tower, which rose above the irregular roofs of the older and newer portions, thus supplying him with a study lifted out of reach of noise or interruption, and in a slight degree recalling the tower in which he had taken so much pleasure at the Villa Montauto. The study was extremely simple in its appointments, being finished chiefly in <b>stained</b> <b>wood,</b> with a vaulted plaster ceiling, and containing, besides a few pictures and some plain furniture, a writing-table, and a shelf at which Hawthorne sometimes wrote standing. A story has gone abroad and is widely believed, that, on mounting the steep stairs leading to this study, he passed through a trap-door and afterwards placed upon it the chair in which he sat, so that intrusion or interruption became physically impossible. It is wholly unfounded. There never was any trap-door, and no precaution of the kind described was ever taken. Immediately behind the house the hill rises in artificial terraces, which, during the romancer's residence, were grassy and planted with fruit-trees. He afterwards had evergreens set out there, and directed the planting of other trees, which still attest his preference for thick verdure. The twelve acres running back over the hill were closely covered with light woods, and across the road lay a level tract of eight acres more, which included a garden and orchard. From his study Hawthorne could overlook a good part of his modest domain; the view embraced a stretch of road lined with trees, wide meadows, and the hills across the shallow valley. The branches of trees rose on all sides as if to embower the house, and birds and bees flew about his casement, through which came the fresh perfumes of the woods, in summer.|$|E

50|$|Catherine Stern also {{devised a}} set of {{coloured}} rods produced by <b>staining</b> <b>wood</b> with aesthetically pleasing colours, and published books on their use at {{around the same time}} as Cuisenaire and Gattegno. Her rods were different colours to Cuisenaire's, and also larger, with a 2cm unit cube rather than 1cm. She produced various resources to complement the rods, such as trays to arrange the rods in, and tracks to arrange them on. Tony Wing, in producing resources for Numicon, built on many of Stern's ideas, also making trays and tracks available for use with Cuisenaire rods.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to develop an environmentally friendly <b>wood</b> <b>stain</b> derived pinar (Quercus aucheri) leaves and determine the color stability of this stain when exposed to UV light irradiation. <b>Wood</b> <b>stains</b> derived from pinar leaves were prepared from aqueous solution with % 3 iron (FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O), % 5 alum ((KAl(SO 4) 2. 12 H 2 O)), and % 10 vinegar mordant mixtures. Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Turkish oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) and oak (Quercus petraea L.) wood specimens were used as staining substrates. After treatment with the <b>stain,</b> the <b>wood</b> panels were exposed to UV light irradiation for periods of 100, 200, and 300 hours and determinated the total color changes was according to ISO 2470 standards.
