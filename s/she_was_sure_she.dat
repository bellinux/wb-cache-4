25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Stephen Kay, {{who had worked}} for the {{prosecution}} in the trial, became alarmed that Manson Family member Leslie Van Houten had gathered 900 signatures on a petition for her parole. He contacted Tate's mother, Doris, who said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> could do better, and the two mounted a publicity campaign, collecting over 350,000 signatures supporting the denial of parole. Van Houten had been seen as the most likely of the killers to be paroled; following Kay's and Tate's efforts, her petition was denied. Doris Tate became a vocal advocate for victims' rights and, in discussing her daughter's murder and meeting other crime victims, assumed the role of counselor, using her profile to encourage public discussion and criticism of the corrections system.|$|E
2500|$|Kevin Taveras, {{one of the}} men accused, {{said that}} Ndonye was accidentally {{separated}} from her boyfriend at an on-campus party and began making out with his nephew, Felipe. Taveras told investigators Ndonye invited them to her dorm room. Taveras told her he had friends to which she replied [...] "Bring 'em along. It'll be hot". Felipe asked her if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>she</b> replied [...] "Yeah, sure, I want to".|$|E
2500|$|In April 2007, Kay was {{watching}} the sixth [...] hour of The Today Show (an apparent jab at NBC's decision to extend it {{at the expense of}} the Passions timeslot) when it was interrupted with a news report that Luis had been arrested. In one August 2007 episode, Tabitha said that a certain soap opera was starting on DirecTV and she would have to tell her friends not to call her between the hours of 2:00 and 3:00 pm, blatantly referring to Passions itself. At the beginning of the show's final week on NBC, as Whitney was preparing to move to New Orleans, Theresa asked if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> wanted to go, and Whitney commented that she had already arranged to have her DirecTV hooked up in Louisiana so she could [...] "keep up on everything happening in Harmony." [...] And also in 2007, Endora flat-out made a reference to the [...] "audience" [...] in one of her thought balloons, prompting Norma to look in the camera and respond, [...] "Audience? What audience?" [...] Endora also pointed out in one of her thought balloons that when Miguel returned to Passions, he looked nothing like Jesse Metcalfe ("Nope, not even close!"). In May 2008 while Juanita was looking for clues in a bookstore as to where Pilar was, the bargain shelf was full of copies of Hidden Passions. In [...] June 2008, Tabitha mentions the fourth hour of Today being a ratings-grabber, poking fun as to how they canceled the soap making way for this fourth hour trying to bring the ratings on NBC up.|$|E
25|$|Stan wakes to find Mitch {{clearing}} out Rosie's room. He helps her pack Rosie's belongings into boxes. The Larsens later visit their new house. When Stan asks Mitch if <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> wants to move, she says yes.|$|R
6000|$|Moreover, if {{she married}} Kit, she must quarrel with her parents. She knew what Osborn thought about him. Had <b>she</b> <b>been</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> loved Kit, the choice {{would have been}} easier, but {{although}} she blushed as <b>she</b> mused, this <b>was</b> too much to own. Yet he loved her, and after all-- ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> not <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> {{had heard}} him, {{and was about}} to repeat her question.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Fillson, {{holding out}} her hand to Mr. Fillson, said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> wasn't.|$|E
60|$|At {{the right}} moment, and when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> was not overheard, Lady Firebrace played her trump card, the pack having been {{previously}} cut by Mr Tadpole.|$|E
60|$|These {{were her}} moods of exaltation. And <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> had never loved her man before, {{that this was}} indeed her beginning. It {{was as if she}} had just found him....|$|E
60|$|Miss Hartley, {{without even}} troubling {{to look at}} him, said that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> had not.|$|R
50|$|Chris is {{beginning}} to live in fear. She has just received an obscene phone call. Is it a coincidence? Or the first of many? Has Ron begun his campaign of revenge identical with the one he carried out on Sharon six years ago? <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> will <b>be</b> Ron's next victim, but without proof there is nothing the law can do to protect her before she becomes another statistic.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in the least. Any one who {{addresses}} her must {{be prepared}} to explain himself fully. Nor ought he to hope to get much encouragement at first. I do not think that Lady Mary will bestow her heart till <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> can give it with safety." [...] There was an amount of falsehood in this which was proof at any rate of very strong friendship on the part of Lady Cantrip.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, for her part," [...] she said, [...] "she hoped Cap'n Pennel {{would be}} blessed in takin' that ar boy; but <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> didn't see much {{that looked like}} it now." ...|$|E
60|$|Once {{more the}} tears filled her soft, gentle {{eyes as she}} stole away, making not the least little sound. When <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> was far enough away to hurry without {{attracting}} Peter's attention, she began to run.|$|E
60|$|Maqueda {{answered}} that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> did not know, but that meanwhile {{it might be}} wise to block {{the mouth of the}} tunnel by which we had reached the plateau in such a fashion that it could not easily be forced.|$|E
50|$|Sid Lackland (Nick Adams) {{aspires to}} serve wealthy {{patients}} {{so he can}} make a lot of money. Then he becomes attached to Loara (Ellen Davalos), a girl from a poor village in Southeast Asia who is one of his patients. She has a rare medical condition and is scheduled for a serious operation. Loara resists his friendly overtures because <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> will die in the hospital. Sid is heartbroken when Loara dies during her surgery.|$|R
50|$|The mission, {{parachuting}} into Nazi-controlled territory, {{was highly}} secret and extremely dangerous; before the operation Reik told friends that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> would ever return.|$|R
50|$|After some frenzied running, Anne {{runs into}} Wentworth {{in the street}} while he is talking to Charles Musgrove. There, she accepts Wentworth's {{proposal}} and, when he asks her whether <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>she</b> says <b>she</b> has never <b>been</b> more determined in her life. The movie skips to Anne and Wentworth in a carriage, Anne blindfolded. Once her blindfold is removed, Anne finds herself {{standing in front of}} Kellynch Hall, Wentworth's wedding present to her. The film ends with Wentworth and Anne on the lawn of their new home, dancing together.|$|R
60|$|She {{smiled at}} him in a {{friendly}} fashion, and he smiled back. The Girl thought {{that she had never}} seen such lovely brown eyes before. He could not be a Haligonian. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> knew all the nice young men with brown eyes in Halifax.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Laura. For {{her part}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> should be charmed with Miss Amory, and quite longed {{to have such}} a friend. And with this she looked Pen full in the face, as if every word the little hypocrite said was Gospel truth.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Falconer's Rubicon was crossed. She {{could not}} draw back now {{if she wanted}} to. But she {{was not at all}} sure that she did want to. By the time she reached home <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> didn't want to. And yet--to give Missy's room to Camilla! It seemed a great {{sacrifice}} to Mrs. Falconer.|$|E
60|$|The {{end of it}} {{was that}} Rachel gave way, not because Noie's {{arguments}} convinced her, but because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> had other reasons she did not choose to advance.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have not}} quite arranged, as yet, sir; but she will, at any rate, remain {{here for a}} time. She loves me as a mother; and I think that, so long as I <b>am</b> {{quartered}} here, <b>she</b> will remain. She has already found a lodging, {{at the house of}} a woman of the same caste as herself; and tells me that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> will <b>be</b> comfortable with her. If we move, and all goes on quietly in the Deccan, she will return to her brother's, where <b>she</b> <b>is</b> thoroughly at home and happy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But you'd {{be such a}} {{beautiful}} bird." [...] The Captain, as he drawled out his words, made an eye at her, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> {{did not like the}} Captain.|$|R
60|$|More {{and more}} Barbara threw out her soul towards Anthony. Across the void of Nothingness she sent it travelling, {{nor did it}} return with empty hands. Something of Anthony had greeted it, though she could not {{remember}} the greeting, had spoken with it, though she could not interpret the words. Of this at least <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>she</b> had been near to Anthony.|$|E
60|$|She listened still. But <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>She</b> {{sank down}} again into bed, into his arms. He held her very close, kissing her. The hymn rambled on outside, {{all the men}} singing their best, having {{forgotten}} everything else {{under the spell of}} the fiddles and the tune. The firelight glowed against the darkness in the room. Anna could hear her father singing with gusto.|$|E
60|$|It {{was long}} past midnight when Grace woke, she knew not how, and looking up, saw {{a light in}} the room, and Mary sitting still over a book, her head resting on her hands. She lay quiet and thought she heard a sob. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> heard tears drop on the paper. She stirred, and Mary was at her side in a moment.|$|E
6000|$|... "God bless you, Aaron," [...] said she; and yet <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>she</b> had not {{declared}} her love. He however thought otherwise, {{and went}} up to New York with a happy heart.|$|R
60|$|Feeling or seeing something, which <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not <b>sure,</b> <b>she</b> {{held the}} lamp above her head, and by its light {{perceived}} a figure standing {{between her and}} the entrance to the cave.|$|R
60|$|The girl blushed and hesitated, {{and then}} said that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> never had. She didn't think she had ever said ten words to Sam since she knew about the box.|$|R
6000|$|Carley {{did not ask}} {{any more}} questions. Natural history was not her {{favorite}} study and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> could dispense with any first-hand knowledge of desert beasts. She thought, however, she heard {{one of the men}} say, [...] "Big varmint prowlin' round the sheep." [...] To which Hutter replied, [...] "Reckon it was a bear." [...] And Glenn said, [...] "I saw his fresh track by the lake. Some bear!" ...|$|E
60|$|During {{the latter}} part of their sojourn in the city, Willy went about a good deal with Miss Barbara because she thought this quiet, soft-spoken lady was not happy and did not take the {{interest}} in handsome and costly articles which was shown by her sister. She had been afraid that this noisy bustling place would be too much for Miss Barbara, and now <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> had been right.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Constance. 'My friend, Rose Rollstone, {{who lives}} just by our house at Westhaven, {{and was going}} back to London the night that Mite was lost, wrote to me that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> had seen his face just then. She thought, and I thought {{it was one of those}} strange things one hears of sights at the moment of death. So I never told of it, but now I cannot help fancying--' ...|$|E

50|$|The crew {{discover}} that Billy {{is not a}} sailor, and Moon and Reno create a new disguise for him from a stolen pair of trousers, a jacket taken from a drunken passenger, and hair cut from Mrs. Harcourt's Pomeranian and made into a beard. Reno tells Billy that Evelyn has kissed her, and <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> will <b>be</b> Lady Oakleigh soon, since love moves so quickly these days ("Anything Goes"). Mrs. Harcourt, recognizing her dog's hair, angrily pulls off Billy's beard and the crew and passengers realize he must be the wanted man. As Snake Eyes Johnson, Billy is an instant celebrity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse me," [...] {{he said in}} English, [...] "but {{that horrible}} female has done {{something}} to you. She has pinched you, hasn't <b>she?</b> I <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> pinched you just now, when she stood by your chair." ...|$|R
