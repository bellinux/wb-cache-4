5000|$|Because of {{the wide}} {{variation}} in hand/carry-on luggage limits, in 2015 IATA released a size recommendation for suitcases meant as hand/carry-on luggage. These state that suitcases should have a maximum size of 55 cm long, 35 cm wide and 20 cm deep. If they meet these requirements, the bag may carry the logo [...] "IATA cabin OK". This limit is tighter than most current airline limits, <b>so</b> <b>bags</b> with this logo are practically allowed everywhere.|$|R
40|$|Fifteen {{lettuce and}} bagged salad shippers were interviewed {{as part of}} a larger study on changes in produce marketing. Retail consolidation, changes in technology, and {{increased}} consumer demand for convenience, product diversity, and year-round availability have all influenced shipper-retailer relations. The interviewed firms provided more fees and services to retail buyers in 1999 than 1994. Most of the bagged salad shippers paid slotting fees, while none of the lettuce shippers were currently doing <b>so.</b> <b>Bagged</b> salad firms tended to offer services to their customers, while lettuce firms generally complied with the service requests made by retailers. lettuce, fresh-cut, bagged salads, fees, services, marketing, Crop Production/Industries, International Relations/Trade, Marketing,...|$|R

50|$|Plastic {{shopping}} bags are {{in most cases}} not accepted by standard curbside recycling programs; though their composition is often identical to other accepted plastics, they pose problems for the single-stream recycling process, {{as most of the}} sorting equipment is designed for rigid plastics such as bottles, <b>so</b> plastic <b>bags</b> often end up clogging wheels or belts, or being confused as paper and contaminating the pulp produced later in the stream.|$|R

5000|$|PG Tags, {{tea bags}} with a string, were {{launched}} in 1985, and tetrahedron-shaped tea bags in 1996 (branded as Pyramid Bags). The tetrahedral bag {{was designed to}} help the tea leaves move more freely, as loose tea moves in a teapot, and supposedly create a better infusion. One 2011 version of the product packaging makes the claim: [...] "The PG Tips pyramid tea bag gives the tea leaves 50% more room to move around than a flat conventional tea <b>bag.</b> <b>So</b> the tea <b>bag</b> works more like a miniature tea pot. This allows for all the freshness to be released for the best tasting cup of PG."

60|$|The {{night was}} very cold and wintry: I sat for some hours behind a blanket screen (which {{had to be}} shifted every few minutes) at my tent-door, keeping up a sulky fire, and peering through the snow for signs of improvement, but in vain. The clouds were not dense, for the moon's light was distinct, shining on the {{glittering}} snow-flakes that fell relentlessly: my anxiety was great, and I could not help censuring myself severely for exposing a party to so great danger at such a season. I found comfort {{in the belief that}} no idle curiosity had prompted me, and that with a good motive and a strong prestige of success, one can surmount a host of difficulties. Still the snow fell; and my heart sank, as my fire declined, and the flakes sputtered on the blackening embers; my little puppy, who had gambolled all day amongst the drifting white pellets, now whined, and crouched under my thick woollen cloak; the inconstant searching wind drifted the snow into the tent, whose roof <b>so</b> <b>bagged</b> in with the accumulation that I had to support it with sticks, and dreaded being smothered, if the weight should cause it to sink upon my bed during my sleep. The increasing cold drove me, however, to my blankets, and taking the precaution of stretching a tripod stand over my head, so as to leave a breathing hole, by supporting the roof if it fell in, I slept soundly, with my dog at my feet.|$|R
