25|$|In 1951, Percival Aircraft Company {{formed a}} {{helicopter}} division, and began design {{work on a}} medium-sized helicopter designated P.74. They designed the helicopter to meet Air Ministry Specification EH.125D issued in May 1952 for an experimental helicopter to test jet driven rotors. This experimental helicopter had a teardrop-shaped fuselage with a two-seat cockpit in the nose and a large cabin that ran {{the full length of}} the fuselage. Beneath the cabin floor, two Napier Oryx gas generators fed compressed air to the tips of the three rotor blades through triple ejector ducts. The rotor blades used ailerons on the trailing edges with pitch control achieved by a <b>screw</b> <b>jack.</b> The unusual engine location required that exhaust pipes pass through the cabin wall between the rows of seats. This created excessive noise and heat for intended passengers.|$|E
500|$|The [...] pool used [...] pavers that weigh [...] [...] The pavers were {{rested on}} <b>screw</b> <b>jack</b> {{pedestals}} {{in order to}} be leveled and shimmed. [...] The pavers had to be perfectly leveled for the water to work correctly because the fountain incorporates numerous sensors to regulate the flow and level of the water.|$|E
2500|$|Workers made a pontoon out of {{two pairs}} of barges, spaced to create a {{platform}} [...] long and [...] wide, which carried the bridge with [...] of overhang. Stringers supported the bridge in forty-two places, with a 40-ton <b>screw</b> <b>jack</b> at each stringer for easier loading and unloading. When workers reached the Manchester Bridge, they had to adjust the bridge to fit the clearance, which was [...] and [...] less than the bridge’s height. After supporting the bridge under the floor beams, they disassembled the top chord and stabilized each panel point on the trusses. Steering the bridge under the Manchester Bridge and the railroad bridge at Brunot's Island, the tugboat captains went through the Ohio River lock and up the back channel toward Coraopolis, where piers and abutments had been constructed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>jacks</b> {{have now}} largely been {{replaced}} by hydraulic jacks. This was encouraged in 1858 when jacks by the Tangye company to Bramah's hydraulic press concept were applied to the successful launching of Brunel's , after two failed attempts by other means. The maximum mechanical advantage possible for a hydraulic jack is not limited by the limitations on <b>screw</b> <b>jacks</b> and can be far greater. After World War II, improvements to the grinding of hydraulic rams {{and the use of}} O ring seals reduced the price of low-cost hydraulic jacks and they became widespread for use with domestic cars. <b>Screw</b> <b>jacks</b> still remain for minimal cost applications, such as the little-used tyre-changing jacks supplied with cars.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} ram BOPs of the 1920s {{were simple}} and rugged manual devices with minimal parts. The BOP housing (body) had a vertical well bore and horizontal ram cavity (ram guide chamber). Opposing rams (plungers) in the ram cavity translated horizontally, actuated by threaded ram shafts (piston rods) {{in the manner}} of a <b>screw</b> <b>jack.</b> Torque from turning the ram shafts by wrench or hand wheel was converted to linear motion and the rams, coupled to the inner ends of the ram shafts, opened and closed the well bore. Such <b>screw</b> <b>jack</b> type operation provided enough mechanical advantage for rams to overcome downhole pressures and seal the wellbore annulus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>jacks</b> {{are limited}} in their lifting capacity. Increasing load {{increases}} friction within the screw threads. A fine pitch thread, which would increase {{the advantage of the}} screw, also reduces the size and strength of the threads. Longer operating levers soon reach a point where the lever will simply bend at their inner end.|$|R
500|$|On the {{day that}} the two halves of the bridge were joined, each side of Columbus Drive was closed for a 12-hour period and a [...] crane was used to install the girders.

50|$|A Natterer {{compressor}} was {{a type of}} {{air compression}} machine which was used in early experiments in making liquid oxygen (LOX) in the 1870s. A manually operated <b>screw</b> <b>jack</b> was utilized to compress air or other gases up to ~200 atm (~3000 psi).|$|E

50|$|A {{jockey wheel}} is a {{retractable}} adjustable-height wheel {{used on the}} front of trailers with either a single axle (two running wheels) or more close-coupled axles at or near the centre of gravity whereby without additional support, the trailer would not remain 'level'. The jockey wheel is situated close to the towing hitch and has a built-in <b>screw</b> <b>jack</b> to enable the trailer nose to be lifted over the tow ball of a car or other powered vehicle. The <b>screw</b> <b>jack</b> can then be used to gently lower the trailer nose onto the tow ball. Once securely attached to the towing vehicle, the jockey wheel's jacking action is fully retracted for stowage. The jockey wheel is also unclamped and lifted as far as possible to give the greatest ground clearance before reclamping prior to a journey being made.|$|E
50|$|Elevating a whole {{structure}} is typically done by attaching a temporary steel framework under the structure {{to support the}} structure. A network of hydraulic jacks is placed under the framework and controlled by a unified jacking system, elevates the structure off the foundation. An older, low-technology method is to use building <b>jacks</b> called <b>screw</b> <b>jacks</b> or jackscrews which are manually turned.|$|R

40|$|Students at Karlstad University {{has carried}} out a degree project within the Study Programme in Mechanical Engineering. The {{projects}} main purpose is to apply {{the knowledge of the}} Programme and shall be carried out together with a company. The project shall be driven out independently and lead to both an oral and a written presentation.   This report describes a work of improvement for Metso Paper in Karlstad, referring to the motor and drive train mechanism of two <b>screw</b> <b>jacks</b> that is used to tightening the wind or felt in the paper machine. This project has lead to a complete proposition, a description of manufacturing and is founded upon an asynchronous motor with a thoroughgoing drive shaft with two planetary gear boxes on both side of the motor. This solution is a result of an evaluation of different concept (chapter 2), regarding common motors and gears on the market. The reason that we used this motor and gears is mainly due to the minor space requirements that such solution can accomplish, with an inline drive train. The solution shall be able to fit different configurations of <b>screw</b> <b>jacks,</b> regarding the size of motor, ratio of gears and the length between the jacks. This is mainly done with adjustments of the holder, to fit the motor {{and the rest of the}} drive train. But this is basically the same solution. Subsequently the motor, gears and other components is selected accordingly to this report and we have chosen to show our solution fully on the <b>screw</b> <b>jacks</b> A 50 that is placed in configuration that is about 6 m apart. Further, due to the conditions in the paper machine, a cover has been designed to prevent the paper pulp to come in direct contact with motor and drive train.   The requirements that Metso Paper has set up is that the solution should be able to come as a module, meaning in our case that the motor, drive train and holder can be delivered as one unit together with a parallel shaft that connects the two <b>screw</b> <b>jacks.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Like {{the other}} simple {{machines}} a screw can amplify force; a small rotational force (torque) {{on the shaft}} can exert a large axial force on a load. The smaller the pitch, {{the distance between the}} screw's threads, the greater the mechanical advantage, the ratio of output to input force. Screws are widely used in threaded fasteners to hold objects together, and in devices such as screw tops for containers, vises, <b>screw</b> <b>jacks</b> and <b>screw</b> presses.|$|R
