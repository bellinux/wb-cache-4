In this paper, a parallel coupled optical ring resonator filter is studied and the transfer function is derived using the Signal Flow Graph approach to identify the filter performance in terms of crosstalk suppression bandwidth and signal integrity. This paper proposes {{the use of the}} Signal Flow Graph (Mason’s rule) approach to determining the filtering characteristics of ring resonators. A commercial electromagnetic simulator is used to validate the analytical model.

These patterns {{are indicative of}} conserved selection pressures, but cannot be fully explained by known oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Using integrative analysis of CNA data from patient tumors and experimental systems, we report that principal component analysis-defined CNA signatures are predictive of glycolytic phenotypes, including FDG-avidity of patient tumors, and increased proliferation. The primary glycolysis-linked CNA signature is associated with p 53 mutation and shows coordinate amplification of glycolytic genes and other cancer-linked metabolic enzymes including TIGAR and RPIA. In contrast, alternative signatures involve both different mechanisms of tumor <b>suppression</b> <b>loss</b> (eg, MDM 2 amplification) and different glycolysis enzyme isoforms. Furthermore, a cross-species CNA comparison identified 21 conserved CNA regions, containing 13 enzymes in the glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways in addition to known cancer driving genes. In validation experiments, exogenous expression of hexokinase and enolase enzymes resulted in reduced propensities for amplifications at the corresponding endogenous loci. Our findings support metabolic stress as a selective pressure underlying the recurrent CNAs observed in human tumors, and further cast genomic instability as an enabling event in tumorigenesis and metabolic evolution...|$|E
40|$|Iqg 1 p is a {{component}} of the actomyosin contractile ring that is required for actin recruitment and septum deposition. Cells lacking Iqg 1 p function have an altered bud-neck structure and fail to form a functional actomyosin contractile ring resulting in a block to cytokinesis and septation. Here it is demonstrated that increased expression of the actin cytoskeleton associated protein Bsp 1 p bypasses the requirement for contractile ring function. This also correlates with reduced bud-neck width and remedial septum formation. Increased expression of this protein in a temperature-sensitive iqg 1 - 1 background causes remedial septum formation at the bud neck that is reliant upon chitin synthase III activity and restores cell separation. The observed suppression correlates with a restoration of normal bud-neck structure. While Bsp 1 p is {{a component}} of the contractile ring, its recruitment to the bud neck is not required for the observed <b>suppression.</b> <b>Loss</b> of Bsp 1 p causes a brief delay in the redistribution of the actin cytoskeleton normally observed at the end of actin ring contraction.

We found that tpp 1 apn 1 rad 1 yeast exhibited slow growth but frequently gave rise to spontaneous slow growth suppressors that segregated as single-gene mutations. Using a candidate gene approach, we identified several tpp 1 apn 1 rad 1 suppressors. Deleting uracil glycosylase suppressed both tpp 1 apn 1 rad 1 and apn 1 apn 2 rad 1 growth defects by reducing the abasic site burden.

Here {{we show that}} STAT 5 is required for T helper-cell pathogenicity in autoimmune neuroinflammation but not in experimental colitis. Although STAT 5 promotes regulatory T cell generation and immune <b>suppression,</b> <b>loss</b> of STAT 5 in CD 4 + T cells resulted in diminished development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Our results showed that loss of encephalitogenic activity of STAT 5 -deficient autoreactive CD 4 + T cells was independent of IFN-γ or interleukin 17 (IL- 17) production, but {{was due to the}} impaired expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a crucial mediator of T-cell pathogenicity. We further showed that IL- 7 -activated STAT 5 promotes the generation of GM-CSF-producing CD 4 + T cells, which were preferentially able to induce more severe EAE than TH 17 or TH 1 cells. Consistent with GM-CSF-producing cells being a distinct subset of TH cells, the differentiation program of these cells was distinct from that of TH 17 or TH 1 cells. We further found that IL- 3 was secreted in a similar pattern as GM-CSF in this subset of TH cells. In conclusion, the IL- 7 -STAT 5 axis promotes the generation of GM-CSF/IL- 3 -producing TH cells. These cells display a distinct transcriptional profile and may represent a novel subset of T helper cells which we designate as TH-GM...|$|E
40|$|The tumour {{microenvironment}} is {{an important}} aspect of cancer biology that contributes to tumour initiation, tumour progression and responses to therapy. The composition and characteristics of the tumour microenvironment vary widely and are important in determining the anti-tumour immune response. Successful immunization requires activation of both innate and adaptive immunity. Generally immune system is compromised in patients with cancer due to immune <b>suppression,</b> <b>loss</b> of tumour antigen expression, and dysfunction of antigen presenting cells (APC). Thus therapeutic immunization leading to cancer regression remains a significant challenge. Certain cells of the immune system, including dendritic cells (DCs) and γδ T cells are capable of driving potent anti-tumour responses. The property of MHC-unrestricted cytotoxicity, high potential of cytokine release, tissue tropism and early activation in infections and malignant disease makes γδ T cells as an emerging candidate for immunotherapy. Various strategies are being developed to enhance anti-tumour immune responses of γδ T cells and dendritic cells {{one of them is the}} use of novel adjuvants like TLR agonists which enhance γδ T cell function directly or through DC activation which has ability to prime γδ T cells. TLR agonists are being used clinically either alone or in combination with tumour antigens and has shown initial success in both enhancing immune responses and eliciting anti-tumour activity. TLR activated γδ T cells and dendritic cells nurture each other’s activation. This provides a potent base for first line of defense and manipulation of the adaptive response against pathogens and cancer. The available data provides a strong rational for initiating combinatorial therapy for the treatment of diseases and this review will summarize the application of adjuvants (TLRs) for boosting immune response of γδ T cells to treat cancer and infectious diseases and their use in combinatorial therapy...|$|E
40|$|The first {{portion of}} this work {{develops}} techniques for generating femtosecond-pulses from conventional fabry-perot laser diodes using nonlinear-spectral-broadening techniques in Yb-doped positive dispersion fiber ampliers. The approach employed an injection-locked fabry-perot laser diode followed by two stages of nonlinear-spectralbroadening to generate sub- 200 fs pulses. This thesis demonstrated that a 60 ps gain-switched fabry-perot laser-diode can be injection-locked to generate a single-longitudinal-mode pulse and compressed by nonlinear spectral broadening to 4 ps. Two problems have been identified that must be resolved before moving forward with this approach. First, gain-switched pulses from a standard diode-laser {{have a number of}} characteristics not well suited for producing clean self-phase-modulation broadened pulses, such as an asymmetric temporal shape, which has a long pulse tail. Second, though parabolic pulse formation occurs for any arbitrary temporal input pulse profile, deviation from the optimum parabolic input results in extensively spectrally modulated self-phase-modulation-broadened pulses. In conclusion, the approach of generating self-phase-modulation-broadened pulses from pulsed laser diodes has to be modified from the initial approach explored in this thesis. The first Yb-doped chirally-coupled-core fiber based systems are demonstrated and characterized in the second {{portion of this}} work. Robust single-mode performance independent of excitation or any other external mode management techniques have been demonstrated in Yb-doped chirally-coupled-core fibers. Gain and power efficiency characteristics are not compromised in any way in this novel fiber structure up to the 87 W maximum power achieved. Both the small signal gain at 1064 nm of 30. 3 dB, and the wavelength dependence of the small signal gain were comparable to currently deployed large-mode-area-fiber technology. The efficiencies of the laser and amplifier were measured to be 75 % and 54 % respectively. With the inherent design tradeoff between the fundamental mode loss and higher order mode <b>suppression,</b> <b>loss</b> effects on system efficiency in different confgurations were investigated. From these investigations it was seen that the slope-effciency depends only on the total loss of the active fiber, and that when loss is present, the counter-propagating configuration has substantial advantages over the co-propagating case. In this thesis chirally-coupled-core fiber as the technological basis {{for the next generation of}} monolithic high power fiber laser systems has been established...|$|E

40|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} a complex disease that is thought to arise when cells {{accumulate}} mutations that allow for uncontrolled growth. There are several recognized mechanisms for generating such mutations in sporadic colon cancer; {{one of which is}} chromosomal instability (CIN). One hypothesized driver of CIN in cancer is the improper repair of dysfunctional telomeres. Telomeres comprise the linear ends of chromosomes and play a dual role in cancer. Its length is maintained by the ribonucleoprotein, telomerase, which is not a normally expressed in somatic cells and as cells divide, telomeres continuously shorten. Critically shortened telomeres are considered dysfunctional as they are recognized as sites of DNA damage and cells respond by entering into replicative senescence or apoptosis, a process that is p 53 -dependent and the mechanism for telomere-induced tumor <b>suppression.</b> <b>Loss</b> of this checkpoint and improper repair of dysfunctional telomeres can initiate a cycle of fusion, bridge and breakage that can lead to chromosomal changes and genomic instability, a process that can lead to transformation of normal cells to cancer cells. Mouse models of telomere dysfunction are currently based on knocking out the telomerase protein or RNA component; however, the naturally long telomeres of mice require multiple generational crosses of telomerase null mice to achieve critically short telomeres. Shelterin is a complex of six core proteins that bind to telomeres specifically. Pot 1 a is a highly conserved member of this complex that specifically binds to the telomeric single-stranded 3 ’ G-rich overhang. Previous work in our lab has shown that Pot 1 a is essential for chromosomal end protection as deletion of Pot 1 a in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) leads to open telomere ends that initiate a DNA damage response mediated by ATR, resulting in p 53 -dependent cellular senescence. Loss of Pot 1 a in the background of p 53 deficiency results in increased aberrant homologous recombination at telomeres and elevated genomic instability, which allows Pot 1 a-/-, p 53 -/- MEFs to form tumors when injected into SCID mice. These phenotypes are similar to those seen in cells with critically shortened telomeres. In this work, we created a mouse model of telomere ysfunction in the gastrointestinal tract through the conditional deletion of Pot 1 a that recapitulates the microscopic features seen in severe telomere attrition. Combined intestinal loss of Pot 1 a and p 53 lead to formation of invasive adenocarcinomas in the small and large intestines. The tumors formed with long latency, low multiplicity and had complex genomes due to chromosomal instability, features similar to those seen in sporadic human colorectal cancers. Taken together, we have developed a novel mouse model of intestinal tumorigenesis based on genomic instability driven by telomere dysfunction...|$|E

Secondly, the difficulty of assigning a market value to resources such as biodiversity or endangered species should be mentioned.

This work quantitatively explains the recently observed suppression of chemical reactions between two rotational states of fermionic KRb molecules confined in one-dimensional tubes with a weak lattice along the tubes [Yan et al., Nature 501, 521 - 525 (2013) ]. New loss rate measurements performed for different lattice parameters but under controlled initial conditions allow us {{to show that the}} <b>loss</b> <b>suppression</b> is a consequence of the combined effects of lattice confinement and the continuous quantum Zeno effect. A key finding, relevant for generic strongly reactive systems, is that while a single-band theory can qualitatively describe the data, a quantitative analysis must include multiband effects.

A rate equation can describe much of the data, but to properly reproduce the loss dynamics with a fixed filling fraction for all lattice parameters we develop a mean-field model and benchmark it with numerically exact time-dependent density matrix renormalization group calculations.
