The proposed mint never came into existence, but in 1656, Blondeau was given official appointment to strike £2,000 worth of coins bearing Cromwell's portrait with captured Spanish silver. The former Royal Mint superintendent, William John Hocking, believed that the edge lettering on Blondeau's coinage was created by means of a perforated steel strip, through which the coin's metal flowed during striking, creating the raised designs and wording. Hocking suggested that this technique would have been less costly than the older method involving the <b>split</b> <b>collar,</b> because the steel strip could be replaced more economically. However, the numismatist Peter B. Gaspar determined that Blondeau's Cromwell-era coinage was struck without a collar, which suggests that he used a machine to impart the edge lettering prior to striking.|$|E

40|$|According to the CERN-LHC (Large Hadron Collider) {{reference}} design, 10 -tesla twin-aperture NbTi dipoles will be {{built with}} <b>split</b> <b>collars</b> that enclose both apertures. As part of the development program towards an experimental 11. 5 -tesla Nb 3 Sn LHC dipole magnet, the mechanical implications of an alternative collar concept have been studied with a finite element analysis. In this concept ring shaped collars are shrunk on each finished single aperture coil, thus providing the necessary room-temperature prestress. This system results in a major improvement of the stress distribution in the collars. It is noted that introduction of friction at the sliding planes can cause reopening of {{the gap between the}} yoke halves during excitation. This depends strongly on the value of the friction coefficient...|$|R

The septins are a family of GTPases that form heteromeric complexes that can assemble into paired filaments in vitro (Fig. 1 a). They were discovered as cell division cycle mutants in yeast (Hartwell, 1971), and a role in cell division is conserved in humans (Kinoshita et al., 1997). In mammals, septins {{are involved in a}} variety of functions at the interface of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton and membranes, and are implicate...|$|R

50|$|Before milled coinage gained {{precedence}} in Europe, {{the irregular}} and crude hammered coinage was {{relatively easy to}} counterfeit and subject to clipping, an act which involved removing valuable metal {{from the edge of}} a coin before placing it back into circulation. In the sixteenth century, the French engineer Aubin Olivier introduced to France the coin press, to which he added a <b>split</b> <b>collar</b> capable of creating edge lettering. In order to remove the newly struck coin, the collar had to be disassembled, which was a time-consuming process. In addition, the upper coinage die was prone to strike the collar on its descent, causing expensive damage. Peter Blondeau addressed those concerns when, in 1649, he was summoned to the Royal Mint in England to modernise minting operations there. Blondeau introduced a method for edge lettering which he claimed was considerably faster and less costly than the earlier, well-known technology, but he maintained secrecy in regards to the device.|$|E

40|$|Septins are conserved filament-forming {{proteins}} that act in diverse cellular processes. They closely associate with membranes and, in some systems, {{components of the}} cytoskeleton. It is not well understood how filaments assemble into higher-order structures in vivo or how they are remodeled throughout the cell cycle. In the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, septins are found {{through most of the}} cell cycle in an hourglass organization at the mother-bud neck until cytokinesis when the <b>collar</b> <b>splits</b> into two rings that disassemble prior to the next cell cycle. Experiments using polarized fluorescence microscopy have suggested that septins are arranged in ordered, paired filaments in the hourglass and undergo a coordinated 90 ° reorientation during splitting at cytokinesis. This apparent reorganization could be due to two orthogonal populations of filaments disassembling and reassembling or being preferentially retained at cytokinesis. In support of this idea, we report a decrease in septin concentration at the mother-bud neck during cytokinesis consistent with other reports and the timing of the decrease depends on known septin regulators including the Gin 4 kinase. We took a candidate-based approach to examine what factors control reorientation during splitting and used polarized fluorescence microscopy to screen mutant yeast strains deficient in septin interacting proteins. Using this method, we have linked known septin regulators to different aspects of the assembly, stability, and reorganization of septin assemblies. The data support that ring splitting requires Gin 4 activity and an anillin-like protein Bud 4, and normal accumulation of septins at the ring requires phosphorylation of Shs 1. We found distinct regulatory requirements for septin organization in the hourglass compared to split rings. We propose that septin subpopulations can vary in their localization and assembly/disassembly behavior in a cell-cycle dependent manner at cytokinesis...|$|R
40|$|A {{metallic}} threaded composite fastener, particularly {{suited for}} high temperature applications, has a body member made of {{high temperature resistant}} composite material with a ceramic coating. The body member has a head portion configured to be installed in a countersunk hole and a shank portion which is noncircular and tapered. One part of the shank may be noncircular and the other part tapered, or {{the two types of}} surface could be combined into a frustum of a noncircular cone. A <b>split</b> <b>collar</b> member made of high strength, high temperature tolerant metal alloy is split into two halves and the interior of the halves are configured to engage the shank. The exterior of the collar has a circumferential groove which receives a lock ring to secure the collar halves to the shank. In the assembled condition torque may be transmitted from the body to the <b>split</b> <b>collar</b> by the engaged noncircular portions to install and remove the fastener assembly into or from a threaded aperture and shear loads in the collar threads are transferred to the shank tapered portion as a combination of radial compression and axial tension loads. Thus, tension loads may be applied to the fastener shank without damaging the ceramic coating...|$|E
