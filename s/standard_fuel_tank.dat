5000|$|The <b>standard</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> {{offered a}} 1,200 US gallon capacity, while 2,400 or 3,000 US gallon tanks were optional. In practice, all SD24s ordered had the 3,000 gallon tank {{except for the}} last built, Kennecott Copper's single locomotive. In order to provide room for a larger fuel tank, the air {{reservoirs}} were relocated on the roof just behind the locomotive's cab. The tanks were known as [...] "torpedo tubes" [...] due to their long, thin design.|$|E

The {{first of the}} problems with the coupe is engine access which because the car is a mid rear arrangement proposed several problems and made the car hard to work on, it is reported that the subframe had to be removed in order to work on the engine. The second problem is the KV6 powerplant which had to have a bespoke smaller fuel tank to fit in the engine bay as the <b>standard</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> wouldn't fit, although disputed as to whether the car received the KV6 powerplant in the first place.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a rule-based expert system {{to manage the}} operation of the Space Shuttle's cryogenic fuel system. Rules are based on <b>standard</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> operating procedures described in the EECOM Console Handbook. The problem of configuring {{the operation of the}} Space Shuttle's fuel tanks is well-bounded and well defined. Moreover, the solution of this problem can be encoded in a knowledge-based system. Therefore, a rule-based expert system is the appropriate paradigm. Furthermore, the expert system could be used in coordination with power system simulation software to design operating procedures for specific missions...|$|E

25|$|Another {{approach}} {{to facilitate the}} use of biodiesel in cold conditions is by employing a second <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> for biodiesel {{in addition to the}} <b>standard</b> diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>tank.</b> The second <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> can be insulated and a heating coil using engine coolant is run through the <b>tank.</b> The <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> can be switched over when the fuel is sufficiently warm. A similar method can be used to operate diesel vehicles using straight vegetable oil.|$|R

5000|$|A {{commercial}} vehicle is {{any type of}} motor vehicle used for transporting goods or paid passengers. The European Union defines a [...] "commercial motor vehicle" [...] as any motorised road vehicle, that by its type of construction and equipment is designed for, and capable of transporting, whether for payment or not: (1) more than nine persons, including the driver; (2) goods and [...] "standard fuel tanks". This means the tanks permanently fixed by the manufacturer to all motor vehicles of the same type as the vehicle in question and whose permanent fitting lets fuel be used directly, both for propulsion and, where appropriate, to power a refrigeration system. Gas tanks fitted to motor vehicles for the direct use of diesel as a <b>fuel</b> are considered <b>standard</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks.</b>|$|R

50|$|Fuel {{bladders}} or fuel storage bladders are collapsible, flexible storage bladders (also {{known as}} tanks) that provide temporary or long term storage for industrial liquids (e.g. fuels). These pillow shaped tanks {{are designed for}} large volume liquid transport, industrial chemicals, potable water, sludge, and <b>fuel</b> storage. <b>Standard</b> <b>fuel</b> bladder <b>tanks</b> sizes range from 100 gal to 200,000 gal capacities and larger and custom fuel storage bladders and cells are available, although at sizes exceeding 50,000 gal there is an increased spill risk. To {{minimize the risk of}} leakage, {{and for the sake of}} containing a catastrophic spill, all fuel bladders should be housed in secondary containment. The use of fuel bladders without precautionary measures is risky and should not be undertaken. The fines involved with fuel spills are well known and the EPA has set clear guidelines for the use of secondary containment concerning fuel bladders.|$|R
5000|$|The Cavalcade {{features}} a 16 valve DOHC 1360 cc V4 with hydraulic lash adjusters and shaft drive for low maintenance. Many {{of the standard}} features on the Cavalcade were considered options on other motorcycles in 1985. The LX and LXE models feature self-cancelling turn signals, automatic rear pneumatic leveling system, rear suspension load pre-tensioner, air-adjustable damping on the front shocks that could be refilled with a standard tire pump connection, electronic cruise control, radio and cassette deck with LCD station display, volume and station selection controls on the handlebars, adjustment knob for the headlight, adjustable passenger floorboards, fore to aft top case adjustment for passenger comfort, adjustable handlebars and adjustable windshield. The radio is in a decorative housing that resembles a <b>standard</b> motorcycle <b>fuel</b> <b>tank.</b> The radio has an automatic volume control that raises and lowers the radio volume based on {{the speed of the}} motorcycle. The Cavalcade <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> is located under the driver's seat but is filled {{from the top of the}} decorative tank. A standard automobile-type oil filter is located midline of the underside of the chassis between the exhaust pipes. The engine is liquid cooled with a thermostatically-controlled electric fan. The radio antenna could be unscrewed and lowered so as not to interfere with the positioning of the weather cover, which was standard with all models.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the early}} 1960s {{there was a}} big enough {{contingent}} of people modifying motorcycles, still mostly big Harley-Davidsons, that a certain style had begun to take hold. A set of modifications became common: the fat tires and 16" [...] wheels of the stock motorcycles were replaced with narrower tires often on a larger 19" [...] or 21" [...] wheel. Forward-mounted foot pegs replaced the standard large 'floorboard' foot rests. Frequently the <b>standard</b> headlight and <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> were replaced with much smaller ones. Often upgraded chromed parts (either one-off fabricated replacements or manually chromed stock parts) were added. It is in this era that what we would today consider a chopper came into existence and began to be called the chopper.|$|R
25|$|Because of the {{unconventional}} layout, {{there was no}} space in the fuselage to place a <b>fuel</b> <b>tank.</b> Although drop tanks were implemented to extend its range, the <b>standard</b> <b>fuel</b> load was carried in the wings, {{with the result that}} the P-39 was limited to short-range tactical strikes.|$|R

5000|$|The 1600 Junior Z was {{launched}} at the 54th Turin Motor Show in November 1972.

As a consequence, at 4 metres long the 1600 Junior Z measured [...] mm more than the 1300. This can be seen at the back were the sloping roofline runs further back and the back panel is different and lower. The lower part of the rear bumper features a bulge {{to make room for the}} spare tire. The 1,570 cc engine with two twin-choke carburettors had an output [...] or 125 PS SAE at 6,000 rpm.Top speed rose to 190 km/h.Besides the longer tail, a number of exterior details distinguished the 1600 Junior Z from the previous model: the arched front bumper was bulkier, the fuel filler was moved to the left hand side, the tail lights were larger items sourced from the 2000 Berlina, the door handles had black plastic housings, and the exhaust pipe was down turned. Badging on the tail now read [...] "1600 Z" [...] instead of [...] "Junior Z". Inside the steering wheel was now a wood rimmed one, with horn buttons through the three metal spokes. In total 402 examples of the 1600 were made, the last one being produced in 1973; the cars were then sold until 1975.|$|R
