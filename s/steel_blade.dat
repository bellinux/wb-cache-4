5|$|Crude glyphs {{have been}} found on a few stone objects and some {{additional}} wooden items, {{but most of these}} are thought to be fakes created for the early tourism market. Several of the 26 wooden texts are suspect due to uncertain provenance (X, Y, and Z), poor quality craftsmanship (F, K, V, W, Y, and Z), or to having been carved with a <b>steel</b> <b>blade</b> (K, V, and Y), and thus, although they may prove to be genuine, should not be trusted in initial attempts at decipherment. Z resembles many early forgeries in not being boustrophedon, but it may be a palimpsest on an authentic but now illegible text.|$|E

25|$|Apparently {{the end of}} a European or American oar, like tablet A, {{though of}} unknown wood, and cut with a <b>steel</b> <b>blade.</b> It {{measures}} 71.8 × 9 × 2.8cm and is not fluted. Side a is worm-eaten and split at its thick end; side b has fire damage.|$|E
25|$|A small tablet, not fluted, of Pacific {{rosewood}} (Orliac 2005), 22 × 6.8 × 1.8cm. One end is chipped off, but no glyphs are missing. However, {{there appears}} to have been reworking, with the glyphs of line r5 planed off and the adjacent line v1 cut into the planed edge. Fischer also notes underlying hair-line glyphs which suggest to him that K may be a palimpsest. The later, deeper cuts may have been made with a <b>steel</b> <b>blade.</b> These glyphs are rather crude, of about the quality of side b of Echancrée.|$|E
500|$|The Manx Sword of State, a {{ceremonial}} sword {{used at the}} annual Tynwald Day sittings at St John's, Isle of Man, and whenever the Tynwald sits at the Legislative Chambers in Douglas, Isle of Man, is popularly said to have belonged to Óláfr. The sword, which has a [...] <b>steel</b> <b>blade</b> and [...] inch hardwood hilt, is sometimes {{said to have been}} brought back from Spain when Óláfr returned from his pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela; however, recent analysis of the sword has determined that it dates no earlier than the 15th century, and that the blade dates only to the 17th century. The current understanding is that the sword itself was made for the Tynwald meetings of 1417 or 1422.|$|E

2500|$|A single unfluted tablet {{or part of}} a tablet, {{cut into}} pieces and {{assembled}} into a snuff box, 71 × 46–47 × 26–28mm. It is variously said to be made from foreign driftwood or Pacific rosewood. The glyphs that remain, though crudely carved with a <b>steel</b> <b>blade,</b> are in excellent condition, except {{in the center of}} the bottom piece where they have been worn down. There are no glyphs on the inside, as the tablet was planed down to a thickness 4–5mm before being cut into pieces (Fischer 1997:497).|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{provenance}} {{for this}} object is not good, and being {{cut with a}} <b>steel</b> <b>blade</b> makes it suspect, both Métraux and Barthel believed it to be undoubtedly genuine. One reason is that it contains the rare glyph 36 and the rare compounds 38 and 684, and so is an unlikely forgery, though Barthel {{found out about it}} too late to include it in his catalogue. It was sold to the Musée de I'Homme in December 1961 by one Henry Reichlen, who had acquired it from a French family who had owned it for several generations — eighty years, by their count.|$|E
2500|$|The Sebenza is {{a folding}} pocket knife {{manufactured}} by Chris Reeve Knives of Boise, Idaho. [...] It is constructed with a stainless <b>steel</b> <b>blade</b> and titanium handle. [...] Its handle functions as the lock mechanism similar in concept to the Walker linerlock differing {{in that the}} handle itself forms the lock bar which holds the blade open. [...] This mechanism was invented by Chris Reeve, and is called the Reeve Integral Lock (R.I.L). [...] It is also {{commonly referred to as}} the Framelock, {{and is one of the}} most widely implemented locking systems in the folding knife industry, where lock strength and reliability is a product requirement. [...] The name Sebenza is derived from the Zulu word meaning [...] "Work," [...] a tribute to Mr. Reeve's South African origins.|$|E

2500|$|While I {{was hearing}} the boys’ confessions {{on the evening}} of the 5th [...] I was {{suddenly}} terrorized by the sight of a celestial person who presented himself to my mind’s eye. He had in his hand a sort of weapon like a very long sharp-pointed <b>steel</b> <b>blade</b> which seemed to emit fire. At the very instant that I saw all this, I saw that person hurl the weapon into my soul with all his might. I cried out with difficulty and felt I was dying. I asked the boy to leave because I felt ill and no longer had the strength to continue. This agony lasted uninterruptedly until the morning of the 7th. I cannot tell you how much I suffered during this period of anguish. Even my entrails were torn and ruptured by the weapon, and nothing was spared. From that day on I have been mortally wounded. I feel in the depths of my soul a wound that is always open and which causes me continual agony.|$|E
2500|$|Sebenza: [...] {{production}} 1991–present. [...] Folding knife, {{introducing a}} stronger {{variation of the}} Walker linerlock called the Sebenza Integral Lock, also {{commonly known as the}} framelock. [...] The Sebenza is a utility knife with titanium handles and was originally introduced with an ATS-34 stainless <b>steel</b> <b>blade,</b> followed by BG-42 and as of this writing, CPM S35VN steel. [...] The Sebenza comes in two sizes, with blade lengths of 75mm/2.94" [...] (Small Sebenza) and 92mm/3.625" [...] (Large Sebenza). There are currently 3 different models out, in chronological order they are the regular, classic, and current 21 model. The major difference is between the regular and classic/21 model. The regular has scalloping and a smaller lock bar access cut out. The classic is very similar to the 21 (being its predecessor), with the main difference being the classic stamp on the lock side of the knife as well as having a rounded lock bar. They offer inlays ranging from micarta to wood to even ivory on the classic and 21 models. Even though the regular has been discontinued for a few years, they still offer it annually with different inlays every year.|$|E
2500|$|Yudhishthira {{is said to}} be {{a master}} in spearplay warfare in Mahabharata, while Shalya is also noted be an {{excellent}} warrior in the field of spearplay. Also according to Indian Hindu myths, Kartikeya, the son of Lord Shiva {{is said to be}} skilled in spear-fighting, by holding his divine spear called as Vel. The South Asian spear is typically made of bamboo with a <b>steel</b> <b>blade.</b> It can be used in hand-to-hand combat or thrown when the fighters are farther apart. Despite primarily being a thrusting weapon, the wide spearhead also allows for many slashing techniques. By the 17th century, Rajput mercenaries in the Mughal army were using a type of spear which integrated a pointed spear butt and a club near the head, making it similar to a mace. On the other hand, the longer cavalry spear was made of wood, with red cloth attached near the blade to prevent the opponent's blood from dripping to the shaft. The Marathas were revered for their skill of wielding a ten-foot spear called bothati (...) from horseback. Bothati fighting is practiced with a ball-tipped lance, the end of which is covered in dye so that hits may easily be confirmed. In solo training, the spear is aimed at a pile of stones. From this was eventually developed the uniquely Indian vita which has a five-foot length of cord attached to the butt end of the weapon and tied around the spearman's wrist. Using this cord the spear can be pulled back after it has been thrown.|$|E
