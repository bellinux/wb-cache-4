40|$|Most masonry arch {{structures}} {{behave as}} complex 3 -dimensional structures. For {{the convenience of}} the analyst such structures are usually modelled as 2 -dimensional structures {{with the effects of}} their 3 -dimensional characteristics being taken into account by modifying the arch parameters and the output of the analysis. The thesis outlines a research programme which fundamentally attempts to model the 3 -dimensional nature of 'real' arches. An experimental programme comprising tests on skew multi-ring brickwork arch ribs and point loading of a multi-ring brickwork <b>square</b> <b>span</b> arch with an aspect ratio of 1. 25 is used to validate the modelling. The thesis will present the results from the laboratory tests. Class 'A' engineering bricks with 1 : 2 : 9 lime mortar were used to construct the two ring arch ribs. A skew angle of 45 was adopted with a <b>square</b> <b>span</b> between the interfaces of the supports of 3 metres. The <b>square</b> <b>span</b> to rise ratio was 4. The ribs were approximately 670 wide. Headers were provided to prevent ring-separations and the English method of skew arch constructions was used which resulted in the mortar bedding planes being square to the elevation at the crown and inclined to the abutments at the springings. Three-dimensional macro-models are used to simulate both the large-scale square arch tests and the two skew arch tests. The results of each of the FE analyses are compared with data obtained from the corresponding experiments. Reasonable agreement between FE analyses and experimental results has been obtained. The values and applicability of the research in engineering practice have been demonstrated. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} new {{characterization}} of NP using <b>square</b> <b>span</b> programs (SSPs). We first characterize NP as affine map constraints on small vectors. We then relate this characterization to SSPs, which are similar but simpler than Quadratic Span Programs (QSPs) and Quadratic Arithmetic Programs (QAPs) since {{they use a}} single series of polynomials rather than 2 or 3. We use SSPs to construct succinct non-interactive zero-knowledge argu-ments of knowledge. For performance, our proof system is defined over Type III bilinear groups; proofs consist of just 4 group elements, verified in just 6 pairings. Concretely, using the Pinocchio libraries, we estimate that proofs will consist of 160 bytes verified in less than 6 ms...|$|E

40|$|In the United Kingdom many {{existing}} masonry arch bridges {{have been}} subject to alteration and extension in order to continue to contribute to the transportation network. One type of alteration is the introduction of full-height longitudinal brickwork diaphragm walls under the arch barrel. These are confined to side spans under which a clear span is not required. At present there is no guidance to the assessing engineer as to how the arch barrel is to be idealised for analysis. The principal aim of this research programme was to determine the effect that diaphragm supports have on the load carrying capacity of single span brickwork arches and make recommendations regarding the assessment method for this type of structure. At the same time the research will provide robust experimental data which can be used to validate FE models. The paper will present the results from two laboratory tests on multi-ring brickwork <b>square</b> <b>span</b> arches. One arch comprised “strong” brickwork (24. 5 N/mm 2) whilst the other was constructed using “weak brickwork” (9. 1 N/mm 2). Each arch was tested with two different support conditions in the elastic range. The first with the arch supported only at its springings; the second with the addition of point supports to replicate longitudinal diaphragms. Both arches were loaded to failure with intrados supports. Three-dimensional FE macro-model is used to simulate the tests. The significance of the diaphragm supports on the 3 -dimensional behaviour of the arch barrels is discussed and general conclusions and recommendations are presented...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} {{three main}} results which relate to embedding, existence and completion problems for Latin squares. These {{results are presented}} in Chapters 1, 2 and 3. An introduction {{to each of the}} problems is given {{at the beginning of the}} relevant chapter. The introductions include motivation for their study and existing results on the problems. The first result, contained in Chapter 1, concerns the embedding problem for partial totally symmetric quasigroups. Here we prove the following best possible embedding result. For all n &# 8805; 9, any partial totally symmetric quasigroup of order n can be embedded in a totally symmetric quasigroup of order v if and only if v is even and v &# 8805; 2 n + 4. The first results on this problem were obtained by Chaffer et al [12] who proved in 1975 that any partial totally symmetric quasigroup can be embedded in a (complete) totally symmetric quasigroup of finite order (exponential in n). In 1976 Lindner and Cruse [33] obtained much smaller embeddings, showing that any partial totally symmetric quasigroup of order n has an embedding in a totally symmetric quasigroup of order v if v &# 8805; 6 n and v &# 8801; 0 (mod 6). In 1996 and 1997, Raines [42] and Raines and Rodger [43] improved this result by obtaining embeddings of order v for all even v &# 8805; 4 n + 4. In Chapter 2 we determine necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a quasigroup of order n having an automorphism consisting of a single cycle of length m and n &# 8722; m fixed points, and having any combination of the additional properties of being idempotent, unipotent, commutative, semi-symmetric or totally symmetric. Quasigroups with such additional properties and symmetries are equivalent to various classes of triple systems. This result unifies several existing results on this problem (see for example [3], [13], [14], [37], [40] and [41]). The third main result of this thesis concerns the completion of partial Latin squares consisting of two filled rows and two filled columns. A complete solution to the problem is given. In particular it is shown that every partial Latin square of order at least 6 which consists of two filled rows and two filled columns can be completed. The completion of partial Latin squares is an NP-complete problem in general, and notoriously difficult problems arise in determining large families of completable partial Latin squares. The area includes several famous problems and results including the Evans Conjecture, which was settled by Smetaniuk [22] (see Theorem 3. 1. 2), Rysers Theorem [44] (see page 87) and M. Halls Theorem [27] (see Theorem 3. 1. 4). This result is interesting in that unlike most known Latin square completion results, the filled cells of the partial Latin <b>square</b> <b>span</b> both the rows and the columns...|$|E
