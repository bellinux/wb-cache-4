5|$|Six weeks later, Binky was {{involved}} in another mauling. Drunken local teenagers approached the bear's enclosure, apparently hoping to <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> its pool, and one 19-year-old was hospitalized with leg lacerations after he was mauled. The zoo did not confirm that Binky was the attacker, but the bear had blood on his face following the incident.|$|E

5|$|A {{turning point}} for Windle was the 1960 Australian Championships; he came second in the 1650yd {{freestyle}} behind John Konrads and was selected for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. He {{dropped out of high}} school to attend a three-month training camp in Queensland with the Olympic swimming team. Windle did not <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> Rome; team officials merely wanted him to learn from the routine and atmosphere of Olympic swimming. On his return to Australia, he switched to the tutelage of Don Talbot, who also coached Konrads.|$|E
50|$|Sharma is {{the first}} Asian woman and the {{youngest}} {{in the world to}} set a record <b>in</b> open <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> Antarctic waters. Sharma <b>swam</b> 1.4 mi <b>in</b> 41.14 minutes, at a temperature of 1 C, breaking the record of Lynne Cox (USA) and Lewis Pugh (Great Britain).

5|$|Hurricane Ileana never {{significantly}} impacted land, and no {{tropical cyclone}} warnings or watches for the storm. While near peak intensity, it passed 60mi (100km) {{south of the}} unpopulated Socorro Island; a station on the island recorded sustained winds of 59mph (95km/h), with gusts to 77mph (125km/h). The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall along the Mexican coastline, causing flooding in Nayarit, Jalisco, Colima, Michoacán, and Baja California Sur. High surf from Ileana reached the coast, killing one man near Cabo San Lucas despite warnings not to <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{the series}} premiered on Adult <b>Swim</b> <b>in</b> the United States on May 28, 2005, after select episodes had been aired on Adult Swim's Video On Demand service {{for nearly a}} year. On September 27, 2005, Bandai re-released s-CRY-ed under the Anime Legends banner, in three two-disc volumes, {{followed}} by the Anime Legends Complete Collection on October 24, 2006. Following the 2012 closure of Bandai Entertainment, Sunrise announced at Otakon 2013, that Sentai Filmworks had rescued s-CRY-ed, along {{with a handful of}} other former BEI titles. In Australia, the series is licensed by Madman Entertainment.|$|E

50|$|Standard United States {{high school}} swim meets have short course events, {{that is the}} lengths are {{typically}} <b>swum</b> <b>in</b> a 25-yard or meter long pool. The only relay event <b>swum</b> <b>in</b> State or Sectional Championships is the 4×50 yard medley relay.|$|R
40|$|Numerous natural {{processes}} are contingent on microorganisms' ability to swim through fluids with non-Newtonian rheology. Here, {{we use the}} model organism Caenorhabditis elegans and tracking methods to experimentally investigate the dynamics of undulatory <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> shear-thinning fluids. Theory and simulation have proposed {{that the cost of}} swimming, or mechanical power, should be lower in a shear-thinning fluid compared to a Newtonian fluid of the same zero-shear viscosity. We aim to provide an experimental investigation into the cost of <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> a shear-thinning fluid from (i) an estimate of the mechanical power of the swimmer and (ii) the viscous dissipation rate of the flow field, which should yield equivalent results for a self-propelled low Reynolds number swimmer. We find the cost of <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> shear-thinning fluids is {{less than or equal to}} the cost of <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> Newtonian fluids of the same zero-shear viscosity; furthermore, the cost of <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> shear-thinning fluids scales with a fluid's effective viscosity and can be predicted using fluid rheology and simple swimming kinematics. Our results agree reasonably well with previous theoretical predictions and provide a framework for understanding the cost of <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> generalized Newtonian fluids...|$|R
5|$|On the {{infrequent}} {{occasions when}} they <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> oceanic waters, grey reef sharks often associate with marine mammals or large pelagic fishes, such as sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus). There is {{an account of}} around 25 grey reef sharks following a large pod of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.), along with 25 silky sharks (C. falciformis) and a single silvertip shark. Rainbow runners (Elagatis bipinnulata) have been observed rubbing against grey reef sharks, using the sharks' rough skin to scrape off parasites.|$|E
5|$|Presque Isle State Park has two {{distinct}} fishing zones. Lake Erie {{is home to}} perch, trout, walleye, bass, and steelhead. Presque Isle Bay {{is the home of}} muskellunge, northern pike, crappie, smelt, as well as other fish that <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> from the lake. Trout fishing is also allowed in the two waterworks basins, which are stocked by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. Hunting is prohibited at Presque Isle State Park with the exception of controlled duck and goose hunting seasons in designated blinds.|$|E
5|$|Rebirth and {{realms of}} {{existence}} are foundational teachings of Mahavira. According to the Acaranga Sutra, Mahavira comprehended life {{to exist in}} myriad forms, such as animals, plants, insects, water bodies, fire bodies, wind bodies, elemental forms, and others. He taught that a monk should avoid touching or disturbing {{any one of them}} including plants, never <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> water, nor light a fire or extinguish it, nor thrash their arms in the air as such actions can torment or hurt other beings that live in those states of matter.|$|E
50|$|Welsh started <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> {{his final}} years at Scotch College, Melbourne {{and moved into}} {{competitive}} <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> 1995 after leaving school {{at the age of}} eighteen. He trained under coach Ian Pope at the Melbourne Vicentre Club. His first big break came in 1998 at the world <b>swimming</b> championships <b>in</b> Perth, Western Australia with a gold in the 4x100-metre medley relay.|$|R

50|$|Kirby also {{collected}} a gold for <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> the non-final heats of the 4 × 100 m freestyle relay and also <b>swam</b> <b>in</b> the finals of the 200m freestyle individual event. He retired after the championships {{to start a}} coaching career and business.|$|R
5|$|The relics Poseidon's Trident, the Golden Fleece, and Icarus' Wings {{acquired}} in previous games are retained {{and used to}} overcome environmental obstacles, with the Golden Fleece also used to deflect enemy attacks. Kratos acquires a new relic, Hades' Soul, which allows him to safely <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> the River Styx. The Blade of Olympus, a primary weapon in God of War II, is used in this game with the special ability Rage of Sparta for temporary invulnerability and increased attack damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted eagle}} ray (Aetobatus narinari) is a {{cartilaginous}} fish of the eagle ray family, Myliobatidae. As traditionally recognized, it is found globally in tropical regions, including the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Recent authorities have restricted it to the Atlantic (including the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico) with other populations recognized as the ocellated eagle ray (A. ocellatus) and Pacific white-{{spotted eagle ray}} (A. laticeps). Spotted eagle rays are most commonly seen alone, but occasionally <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> groups. They are ovoviviparous, the female retaining the eggs then releasing the young as miniature versions of the parent.|$|E
5|$|Tonelli {{retired after}} the Games. His aquatic success was not derived from any {{physical}} advantage, {{as he was}} relatively small for a swimmer. He was only 185cm tall and weighed 70kg, with relatively small hands and feet. Tonelli felt that his success was based around his ability to make fast starts from the blocks, and attributed his success to his mental approach {{and his ability to}} convert his energy into a fast <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> under one minute. He had a deliberate strategy of making himself nervous before the race, feeling that he thrived on pressure.|$|E
50|$|Szmidt <b>swam</b> <b>in</b> {{competition}} with Russian swimmer Vladimir Salnikov, who dominated long-distance freestyle <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> the late 1970s and early 1980s.
