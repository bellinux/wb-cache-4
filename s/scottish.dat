5|$|<b>Scottish</b> {{music is}} a {{significant}} aspect of the nation's culture, with both traditional and modern influences. A famous traditional <b>Scottish</b> instrument is the Great Highland Bagpipe, a wind instrument consisting of three drones and a melody pipe (called the chanter), which are fed continuously by a reservoir of air in a bag. Bagpipe bands, featuring bagpipes and various types of drums, and showcasing <b>Scottish</b> music styles while creating new ones, have spread throughout the world. The clàrsach (harp), fiddle and accordion are also traditional <b>Scottish</b> instruments, the latter two heavily featured in <b>Scottish</b> country dance bands. There are many successful <b>Scottish</b> bands and individual artists in varying styles including Annie Lennox, Amy Macdonald, Runrig, Boards of Canada, Cocteau Twins, Deacon Blue, Franz Ferdinand, Susan Boyle, Emeli Sandé, Texas, The View, The Fratellis, Twin Atlantic and Biffy Clyro.

5|$|The Second Boer War catalysed {{a renewed}} {{interest}} in establishing a unit composed of <b>Scottish</b> Liverpudlians. On 30 April 1900, the 8th (<b>Scottish)</b> Volunteer Battalion was formed within the King's (Liverpool Regiment), with headquarters later being located at 22 Highgate Street, Edge Hill.

5|$|Devolution {{continued}} {{to be part of}} the platform of the Labour Party which, in May 1997, took power under Tony Blair. In September 1997, the 1997 <b>Scottish</b> devolution referendum was put to the <b>Scottish</b> electorate and secured a majority in favour of the establishment of a new devolved <b>Scottish</b> Parliament, with tax-varying powers, in Edinburgh. An election was held on 6 May 1999, and on 1 July of that year power was transferred from Westminster to the new Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle was not {{a primary}} {{strategic}} target for <b>Scottish</b> attack, as it was positioned away from the main routes through the region, but it was kept well garrisoned during the <b>Scottish</b> wars. The surrounding manor of Embleton had nonetheless suffered from <b>Scottish</b> raids and Gaunt had concerns over {{the condition of the}} castle's defences, ordering the building of additional fortifications around the gatehouse. Part of the surrounding lands around the castle may have been brought into agricultural production at this time, either to feed a growing garrison, or to protect the crops against <b>Scottish</b> attacks.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{years passed}} {{until the next}} <b>Scottish</b> Cup final appearance, when United lost 1–0 to Celtic in 2005. Sandwiched {{in the middle of}} these {{appearances}} was a defeat on penalties to Stenhousemuir in the <b>Scottish</b> Challenge Cup (when United failed to concede a goal in the whole competition) and a 3–0 defeat to Celtic in the 1997 <b>Scottish</b> League Cup Final. United then lost the 2008 <b>Scottish</b> League Cup Final on penalties to Rangers after the match had finished 2–2 after extra time. Dundee United won their next major trophy in 2010, under the guidance of manager Peter Houston, when First Division side Ross County were defeated 3–0 in the 2010 <b>Scottish</b> Cup Final. David Goodwillie scored the first goal and Craig Conway scored the second and third goals.|$|E
5|$|Following a lost {{vote in the}} <b>Scottish</b> Parliament, the SNP-led {{minority}} <b>Scottish</b> Government {{agreed to}} continue the line {{from the airport to}} Leith on condition that no more public money would be supplied. A report by Audit Scotland, commissioned by the <b>Scottish</b> Government, confirmed that the cost projections were sound. The cost of the scheme in 2003 was estimated at £498 million, £375 million in funding from the <b>Scottish</b> Government and £45 million from Edinburgh Council.|$|E
5|$|Formed in 1903 as {{a result}} of the {{amalgamation}} of three clubs from Aberdeen, they rarely challenged for honours until the post war decade, when they won each of the major <b>Scottish</b> trophies under manager Dave Halliday. This level of success was surpassed in the 1980s, when, under the management of Alex Ferguson, they won three league titles, four <b>Scottish</b> Cups and a <b>Scottish</b> League Cup, alongside the two European trophies. Aberdeen were the last club outside of the Old Firm to win a league title, in 1984–85, and also the last <b>Scottish</b> team to win a European trophy. The team has enjoyed less success since this golden era, though a 19-year wait for a major trophy was ended by winning the 2013–14 <b>Scottish</b> League Cup.|$|E
5|$|From 1875 until 1903, Hibs were {{managed by}} a committee, {{although}} Dan McMichael, who also acted as treasurer, secretary and a physiotherapist, was effectively the manager when the club won the 1902 <b>Scottish</b> Cup and the 1903 league championship. Willie McCartney {{took charge of}} part of the league-winning 1947–48 season, but he collapsed and died after a <b>Scottish</b> Cup match in January 1948. Hugh Shaw inherited that team, {{and went on to}} win three league championships in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Alan Stubbs won the <b>Scottish</b> Cup in 2015–16, ending a 114-year drought in that competition. Eddie Turnbull, Alex Miller and John Collins all won one <b>Scottish</b> League Cup each. Bobby Templeton, Bertie Auld, Alex McLeish and Neil Lennon all won second tier championships.|$|E
5|$|From January to April 2009, the <b>Scottish</b> Government {{conducted}} a trial translocation of Eurasian sparrowhawks from around racing pigeon lofts in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Kilmarnock, Stirling and Dumfries. The trial, which cost £25,000, {{was supported by}} the <b>Scottish</b> Homing Union, representing the country's 3,500 pigeon fanciers. The experiment was originally scheduled for early in 2008 but was postponed because it would have impinged on the birds' breeding season. It was criticised by the government's own ecological adviser, Dr Ian Bainbridge, the government body <b>Scottish</b> Natural Heritage and organisations including the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the <b>Scottish</b> Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.|$|E

5|$|Hibernian F.C. footballer Lewis Stevenson {{was born}} in Kirkcaldy. He is the only footballer in the club's history to have won both the <b>Scottish</b> League Cup and <b>Scottish</b> Cup, in 2007 and 2016 respectively. He has made more than 300 {{appearances}} for the Edinburgh club.|$|E
5|$|Hibernian {{have won}} the <b>Scottish</b> league {{championship}} four times, most recently in 1952.

5|$|In July 1989, it was {{announced}} that SBG was to be privatised.

5|$|In art, {{the first}} {{significant}} group {{to emerge in the}} 20th century were the <b>Scottish</b> Colourists in the 1920s: John Duncan Fergusson (1874–1961), Francis Cadell (1883–1937), Samuel Peploe (1871–1935) and Leslie Hunter (1877–1931). Influenced by the Fauvists, they have been described as the first <b>Scottish</b> modern artists and were the major mechanism by which post-impressionism reached Scotland. In the inter-war period, elements of modernism and the <b>Scottish</b> Renaissance, were incorporated into art by figures including Stanley Cursiter (1887–1976), who was influenced by Futurism, and William Johnstone (1897–1981), whose work marked a move towards abstraction. Johnstone also played a part in developing the concept of a <b>Scottish</b> Renaissance with poet Hugh MacDiarmid, which attempted to introduce elements of modernism into <b>Scottish</b> cultural life and bring it into line with contemporary art elsewhere. James McIntosh Patrick (1907–98) and Edward Baird (1904–) were influenced by elements of surrealism.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} quarter of 2016, the <b>Scottish</b> economy {{contracted}} by 0.2%; the UK as a whole grew by 0.7% in the same period. As of September 2015, the <b>Scottish</b> unemployment rate of 5.9% was above the UK rate of 5.5%, while the <b>Scottish</b> employment rate of 74.0% was higher than the UK figure of 73.5%. De-industrialisation during the 1970s and 1980s saw a shift from a manufacturing focus towards a more service-oriented economy.|$|E
5|$|In {{this period}} the Labour Party usually won most <b>Scottish</b> {{parliamentary}} seats, losing this dominance briefly to the Unionists in the 1950s. Support in Scotland {{was critical to}} Labour's overall electoral fortunes as without <b>Scottish</b> MPs it would have gained only three UK electoral victories in the 20th century (1945, 1966 and 1997). The number of <b>Scottish</b> seats represented by Unionists (known as Conservatives from 1965 onwards) went into steady decline from 1959 onwards, until it fell to zero in 1997. The <b>Scottish</b> National Party gained its first seat at Westminster in 1945 and became a party of national prominence during the 1970s, achieving 11 MPs in 1974. However, a referendum on devolution in 1979 was unsuccessful as it did not achieve the support of 40 per cent of the electorate (despite a small majority of those who voted supporting the proposal) and the SNP went into electoral decline during the 1980s. The introduction in 1989 by the Thatcher-led Conservative government of the Community Charge (widely known as the Poll Tax), one year {{before the rest of}} the United Kingdom, contributed to a growing movement for a return to direct <b>Scottish</b> control over domestic affairs. On 11 September 1997, the 700th anniversary of Battle of Stirling Bridge, the Blair-led Labour government again held a referendum on the issue of devolution. A positive outcome led to the establishment of a devolved <b>Scottish</b> Parliament in 1999. The new <b>Scottish</b> Parliament Building, adjacent to Holyrood House in Edinburgh, opened in 2004. Although not reaching its 1970s peak in Westminster elections, the SNP had more success in the <b>Scottish</b> Parliamentary elections with their system of mixed member proportional representation. It became the official opposition in 1999, a minority government in 2007, a majority government from 2011 and a second minority government in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Intellectually, Scott {{and figures}} like Thomas Carlyle {{played a part}} in the {{development}} of historiography and the idea of the historical imagination. Romanticism also influenced science, particularly the life sciences, geology, optics and astronomy, giving Scotland a prominence in these areas that continued into the late nineteenth century. <b>Scottish</b> philosophy was dominated by <b>Scottish</b> Common Sense Realism, which shared some characteristics with Romanticism and was a major influence on the development of Transcendentalism. Scott also played a major part in defining <b>Scottish</b> and British politics, helping to create a romanticised view of Scotland and the Highlands that fundamentally changed <b>Scottish</b> national identity.|$|E
