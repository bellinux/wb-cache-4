40|$|PURPOSE To {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} two digital impression systems {{based on the same}} technology but different postprocessing correction modes of customized software, with consideration of several clinical parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS A maxillary master model with six implants located in the second molar, second premolar, and lateral incisor positions was fitted with six cylindrical <b>scan</b> <b>bodies.</b> <b>Scan</b> <b>bodies</b> were placed at different angulations or depths apical to the gingiva. Two experienced and two inexperienced operators performed scans with either 3 D Progress (MHT) or ZFX Intrascan (Zimmer Dental). Five different distances between implants (<b>scan</b> <b>bodies)</b> were measured, yielding five data points per impression and 100 per impression system. Measurements made with a high-accuracy three-dimensional coordinate measuring machine (CMM) of the master model acted as the true values. The values obtained from the digital impressions were subtracted from the CMM values to identify the deviations. The differences between experienced and inexperienced operators and implant angulation and depth were compared statistically. RESULTS Experience of the operator, implant angulation, and implant depth were not associated with significant differences in deviation from the true values with both 3 D Progress and ZFX Intrascan. Accuracy in the first scanned quadrant was significantly better with 3 D Progress, but ZFX Intrascan presented better accuracy in the full arch. CONCLUSION Neither of the two systems tested would be suitable for digital impression of multiple-implant prostheses. Because of the errors, further development of both systems is required...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of the guided <b>body</b> <b>scan</b> on cigarette cravings and nicotine withdrawal symptoms in temporarily abstinent smokers. In light of evidence that a combination of pharmacotherapy and behavioural support can result in even greater success rates than either strategy alone (Stead & Lancaster, 2012), study one was the first randomised placebo-controlled trial to examine how the <b>body</b> <b>scan</b> interacts with traditional nicotine replacement therapy. Unfortunately, the magnitude of an anti-placebo effect meant that neither the nicotine nor placebo patches had an effect on ratings of withdrawal symptoms and tobacco cravings. The results did however show that the <b>body</b> <b>scan</b> produced significant post intervention reductions relative to baseline, whilst unexpectedly finding that the control audio also yielded similar levels of efficacy. This cast doubt on the theory that the <b>body</b> <b>scan</b> reduces cravings and withdrawal symptoms via the promotion of non-judgemental acceptance of thoughts and feelings, although the idea that both audio interventions acted as a form of cognitive distraction seemed more plausible. The secondary aim was therefore to explore whether cognitive distraction is a mechanism underlying the efficacy of the <b>body</b> <b>scan,</b> with study three comparing a guided <b>body</b> <b>scan</b> to two distraction tasks. The results indicated that relative to baseline, all three interventions produced reductions in withdrawal symptoms up to 10 minutes post task, however the <b>body</b> <b>scan</b> out performed the two distraction tasks in reducing the desire to smoke. This implies that whilst the processes associated with cigarette withdrawal might be vulnerable to disruption via cognitive distraction, the desire for a cigarette is less susceptible. Instead, the <b>body</b> <b>scan</b> may provide additional benefits via the moderation of negative affect or a relaxation response...|$|R

40|$|Research on {{clothing}} related CAD is blooming {{rapidly in}} the last two decades. It speeds up the product development process significantly and shortens the time to market of fashion products. Although many important results have been obtained, particularly in the computer graphics community, the textile industry is somehow reluctance to adopt these results in actual apparel manufacturing. The main concern is the accuracy of the resulted patterns, because the pattern generation processes ignored some important textile material and manufacturing constraints. This paper introduces a method for generating 2 D block patterns from 3 D <b>scanned</b> <b>body.</b> A parameterization process is first conducted on a <b>scanned</b> <b>body</b> to create a parameterized model, represented by horizontal B-spline curves. A basic wire-frame aligned with body features is then established based on the parameterized model. Proper clothing ease is carefully incorporated into the model by scaling the wireframe to accomplish the desired fit. Based on the deformed wireframe, a 3 D flattenable garment is modeled by boundary triangulation. The main contribution of the proposed method is that the created 3 D garment blocks are geometrically flattenable to produce accurate 2 D patterns with optimized ease distribution to ensure garment fit. The proposed method is validated and compared to two conventional block patternmaking methods. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method is easy to implement and can generate patterns with satisfactory fit. Furthermore, the method can be used to create fit-ensured mass-customized apparel product. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

The objective {{of this research was}} to investigate consumer knowledge, interest and concerns towards the applications of RFID and 3 D <b>body</b> <b>scanning</b> in apparel retail. Rogers? (1995) five factors for innovation diffusion, relative advantage, simplicity, compatibility, observability, and trialability and Bauer?s (1960) perceived risk provided the theoretical framework for the study. Consumer responses were utilized for demographic and behavioral segmentation to identify target markets for retailers deploying RFID and 3 D <b>body</b> <b>scanning</b> for specific applications and investigate the consumer acceptance and business deployment of these technologies in apparel retail. 	Testing prior consumer knowledge of the technologies indicated low knowledge level among consumers. Respondents with prior knowledge of RFID and 3 D <b>body</b> <b>scanning</b> had significantly higher acceptance and lower privacy concerns associated with the technologies than respondents without prior knowledge indicating the need to increase the overall knowledge levels through improved literature in popular media and marketing campaigns. Other pre-test results indicated that frequent shoppers had a negative opinion towards apparel shopping suggesting the need to improve the overall shopping experience. 	While {{there were no significant differences}} between male and female responses, female respondents identified size prediction as the most advantageous application of 3 D <b>body</b> <b>scanning.</b> Respondents with higher income ($ 80, 000 +) and aged 40 or under were significantly more willing to accept RFID and 3 D <b>body</b> <b>scanning</b> than the others. Strong acceptance of RFID and 3 D <b>body</b> <b>scanning</b> use in a retail store was also observed for frequent shoppers and technology savvy respondents with significantly fewer concerns of price and privacy than other groups. Respondents indicated low willingness to pay a price premium to avail the benefits of RFID and suggested privacy and health concerns associated with RFID use while they were neutral about being scanned in undergarments. 	A comparative analysis of the two technologies based on Rogers? five factors indicated that 3 D <b>body</b> <b>scanning</b> had significantly higher means for relative advantage, simplicity, compatibility and trialability while there was no difference in observability between the two. The results indicated that 3 D <b>body</b> <b>scanning</b> had significantly greater diffusion potential among consumers than RFID based on Rogers? factors, but both were evaluated favorably. A technology diffusion matrix was constructed based on prior literature and study results to indicate the current diffusion status of the two technologies based on consumer acceptance and business deployment. Recommendations were proposed to improve the overall knowledge of RFID through effective information dispersion to increase consumer acceptance by debunking myths regarding privacy and health concerns. The need to quantify the benefits of 3 D <b>body</b> <b>scanning</b> in the apparel supply chain was identified as a method to increase the overall level of deployment among businesses.
