60|$|It gave Kate a great awe of him, {{partly because}} {{a little girl}} in a book would have gone up, <b>slid</b> <b>her</b> hand into his, and kissed him; but she could nearly as soon have <b>slid</b> <b>her</b> hand into a lion's; and she was right, {{it would have been very}} obtrusive.|$|E
6000|$|That [...] "Now I never will," [...] moved Noel terribly. She <b>slid</b> <b>her</b> arm {{along the}} back of the bench and clasped the skinniest of shoulders.|$|E
60|$|Then {{her head}} sought his support; and big drops fell on him; and anon, Isabel gently <b>slid</b> <b>her</b> head from him, and sat a little composedly beside him.|$|E
60|$|We {{exchanged}} no greetings. She <b>slid</b> from <b>her</b> saddle into my arms, {{and for one}} instant I held her.|$|R
60|$|In the leisurely {{fashion of}} the home-coming ship the Santa Barbara <b>slid</b> into <b>her</b> dock. The {{gangplank}} was thrust out. Kirk walked ashore.|$|R
60|$|Now {{she seemed}} to faint and <b>slid</b> from <b>her</b> horse into his arms, and lay there a moment, while Godwin turned aside his head.|$|R
60|$|Sophy's steel-blue eyes softened. She <b>slid</b> <b>her</b> {{long brown}} {{hand across the}} table and grasped Jack's. He {{returned}} the pressure quickly and fraternally, even to that half-shamed, half-hurried evasion of emotion peculiar to all brothers. This was also a new sensation; but he liked it.|$|E
60|$|She hurriedly {{took off}} her shoes and stockings-how delicious the cool, soft velvet of the grass!-and sitting down on the bank under the great basswood, whose roots formed an abrupt bank, she <b>slid</b> <b>her</b> poor blistered, chafed feet into the water, her bare head leaned against the huge tree trunk.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all. I {{will tell}} every word, {{straight}} out, Giles, if you wish. He said I was to encourage you. There. But I cannot obey him further to-day. Come, {{let us go}} now." [...] She gently <b>slid</b> <b>her</b> hand from his, and went {{in front of him}} out of the Abbey.|$|E
60|$|Our bold fireman {{seized the}} opportunity, got the woman into the shoot, or canvas bag under the lowest ladder, and <b>slid</b> with <b>her</b> in safety to the ground.|$|R
6000|$|His arm <b>slid</b> behind <b>her</b> shoulders. The insinuating music drained her independence. She said mournfully, [...] "Would {{you take}} care of me?" [...] She touched his hand. It was warm, solid.|$|R
6000|$|... "And do {{you think}} I shall always be?" [...] She <b>slid</b> from <b>her</b> chair to her knees {{on the floor beside}} him, where he sat at his desk, and put her arms round him.|$|R
60|$|Then, tucking {{her head}} in his breast, hiding her face, she timidly <b>slid</b> <b>her</b> hands along his sides, {{pressing}} softly, to find the contours of his figure. Softly her hands crept over the silky back of his waistcoat, under his coats, and as they stirred, his blood flushed up, and up again, with fire, till all Siegmund was hot blood, and his breast was one great ache.|$|E
60|$|Placing {{her elbows}} on the table, she <b>slid</b> <b>her</b> ruby ring {{up and down her}} finger abstractedly. She frowned at the rows of leather-bound books {{opposite}} her. Ralph looked keenly at her. Very pale, but sternly concentrated upon her meaning, beautiful but so little aware of herself as to seem remote from him also, there was something distant and abstract about her which exalted him and chilled him at the same time.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Take {{your coat}} off, Dan,' she said coaxingly, {{in a low}} tone meant for no one but him. And she <b>slid</b> <b>her</b> hands on his shoulder, and he yielded, so that the coat was pushed back. She had flushed, and her eyes had grown very bright. She got hold of the cuff of his coat. Gently, he eased himself, so that she drew it off. Then he stood in a thin suit, which {{revealed}} his vigorous, almost mature form.|$|E
60|$|Was it Glenn's eyes or the {{movement}} of his hand that checked her utterance? His gaze pierced her soul. His hand <b>slid</b> along <b>her</b> arm to her waist--around it. Her heart seemed to burst.|$|R
60|$|The frogs {{were busy}} in the ditches, and the moon <b>slid</b> to <b>her</b> setting. Some happy servant had gone out to commune with the night and to beat upon a drum. Kim's next {{sentence}} was in the vernacular.|$|R
60|$|He turned round. She <b>slid</b> out of <b>her</b> {{chair and}} came over to his side.|$|R
60|$|She <b>slid</b> <b>her</b> {{hand under}} his arm; the soft curves of her form brushed him gently, each touch only {{augmented}} his ill-humour. He burned with a perverse rage, {{as if all}} the passions in him were simmering and ready to boil over; {{it was as if a}} poison were trying to work its way out of him, through the layers of his stolid flesh. He maintained a dogged silence; Rozsi, too, said nothing, but when they reached the door, she drew her hand away.|$|E
60|$|He looked ill! And {{suddenly}} she realised that her thoughts were not of him.... When {{she was little}} he would take her on his back; he had built cocked hats for her and paper boats; had taught her to ride; <b>slid</b> <b>her</b> between his knees; given her things without number; and taken his payment in kisses. And now he was ill, {{and she was not}} thinking of him! He had been all that was most dear to her, yet before her eyes would only come the vision of another.|$|E
6000|$|To the Western man (though {{this would}} not please either city) Chicago and Boston are cheek by jowl, and some railroads {{encourage}} the delusion. The Limited whirled the [...] "Constance" [...] into Buffalo and {{the arms of the}} New York Central and Hudson River (illustrious magnates with white whiskers and gold charms on their watch-chains boarded her here to talk a little business to Cheyne), who <b>slid</b> <b>her</b> gracefully into Albany, where the Boston and Albany completed the run from tide-water to tide-water--total time, eighty-seven hours and thirty-five minutes or three days, fifteen hours and one half. Harvey was waiting for them.|$|E
60|$|She <b>slid</b> {{gracefully}} to <b>her</b> feet, {{shook the}} cigarette ash from her clothes, {{and picked up}} her muff.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{all in the}} day's work," [...] she replied; [...] "but I despise a bog {{worse than}} {{anything}} else on the trail. I'll {{show you how to}} go round this one." [...] Thereupon she <b>slid</b> from <b>her</b> horse and came tiptoeing back {{along the edge of the}} mud-hole.|$|R
6000|$|As {{they were}} {{standing}} there a girl came galloping up to the hitching-post and <b>slid</b> from <b>her</b> horse. It was Berea McFarlane. [...] "Good morning, Emery," [...] she called to the surveyor. [...] "Good morning," [...] she nodded at Norcross. [...] "How do you find yourself this morning?" ...|$|R
60|$|And so the old crowd--Harvey {{felt like}} the most ancient of mariners--dropped into the old {{schooner}} among the battered dories, while Harvey slipped the stern-fast from the pier-head, and they <b>slid</b> <b>her</b> along the wharf-side with their hands. Every one wanted to say so much that {{no one said anything}} in particular. Harvey bade Dan take care of Uncle Salters's sea-boots and Penn's dory-anchor, and Long Jack entreated Harvey to remember his lessons in seamanship; but the jokes fell flat {{in the presence of the}} two women, and it is hard to be funny with green harbour-water widening between good friends.|$|E
5000|$|According to Elections Canada in {{the fourth}} quarter of 2012 Hall Findlay's {{campaign}} brought in $149,877.45 in donations, originally believed to be second only to Justin Trudeau who brought in $673,156.53. However, a discrepancy involving money raised to pay off her leadership debt from the 2006 races appears to have <b>slid</b> <b>her</b> into third behind Marc Garneau. [...] Hall Findlay's campaign was managed by Stephen Carter, who managed the Calgary Mayoral campaign of Naheed Nenshi and the Alberta PC campaign under leader Alison Redford.|$|E
5000|$|In her {{meetings}} with Army Reservists, Jones often emphasized the basics, such as physical fitness, {{even for those}} soldiers {{who were able to}} complete their assigned tasks without passing physical fitness examinations. At the Sheridan Army Reserve Center in northwest Baltimore in 2006, she actively demonstrated her stance on the matter to the enlisted leaders of the 80th Division. She <b>slid</b> <b>her</b> body underneath a chair and addressed them from that position: [...] "Let's say you're a soldier and you're a mechanic and you need to get under this Humvee. If you're not physically fit, {{you may not be able}} to fit under the vehicle." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{he ignored}} Mr. Boltwood. His {{eyes focused on}} Claire's face. To steady himself on the running-board he had placed his left hand {{on the side of}} the car, his right on the back of the seat. That right hand <b>slid</b> behind <b>her.</b> She could feel its warmth on her back.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will remember. Yes, I will promise. Go now; the reverent Mother is advised of your coming. And {{report to}} me night and {{morning of the}} {{progress}} of the case. Why, woman, what are you doing?" [...] for she had suddenly <b>slid</b> to <b>her</b> knees and grasped his robes with her thick, filthy hands.|$|R
6000|$|... “That’s all!” {{somebody}} shouted; {{and when}} he let the rope go, the side-wheels churned and the steamer forged ahead while the launch <b>slid</b> clear of <b>her</b> with propeller rattling.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Ink", Claire is {{constantly}} pushed by Gretchen {{to admit that}} she had <b>slid</b> <b>her</b> ribcage back into alignment following her fall from the dorm window, and when Claire tries to brush it aside, Gretchen gets annoyed. Noah comes to Claire's dorm to take her out to dinner; Claire accepts, and despite her objections, Gretchen invites herself along. Vaguely referencing Claire but not by name, Gretchen tells Noah about a girl she saw on YouTube who couldn't feel any pain, tipping Noah off that Gretchen knows about Claire. When Gretchen excuses herself, Noah is aghast and motions to call the Haitian to erase Gretchen's memory, but Claire tells him that Gretchen is the only real friend she's made in college so far and threatens to cut him out of her life entirely (no calls or emails) if he calls the Haitian. On {{the way back to the}} dorm, Gretchen apologizes and admits that she is pushy, then reveals to Claire that everybody in high school called her [...] "Retchin' Gretchen" [...] because she was bulimic. Whilst in the dorm, Claire allows Gretchen to cut her (Claire's) hand with a pair of scissors to demonstrate her healing ability, then she decides to make Gretchen her roommate.|$|E
40|$|When Minerva {{looked into}} the face of her child asleep beside her in the bed, she saw peace, she saw freshness, she saw the world the way it should be. Contentment slept in Kiji 2 ̆ 7 s lips, pink brown lips closed loosely like a small bow. In the curl of her lashes rested hope. In her balled fists, {{strength}} and vulnerability. Minerva hated to wake her. The morning light had just begun to diffuse blue-grey into the small bedroom of Minerva 2 ̆ 7 s mother 2 ̆ 7 s house. They had to get up early to make it to court on time. The lawyer had said they needed to be there by eight. After dressing herself, Minerva slipped the baby 2 ̆ 7 s night clothes off and gently <b>slid</b> <b>her</b> head and arms into the ruffled red dress that James had bought for her. Kiji looked like a valentine in it, all red with white lace. James even bought her a little bow to put in her thick black curls. It was made from white satin ribbon and had a red heart in the middle. Minerva was so proud of the gift that she even told the lady lawyer down at child support about it. That lawyer had smiled a wily, sly kind of smile when she told Minerva to clothe the baby in that pretty dress. She called it 2 ̆ 2 a nice touch. 2 ̆ 2 Minerva had looked puzzled. To explain, the child-support lawyer added, 2 ̆ 2 Just in case. 2 ̆ 2 Just in case, what? Minerva wanted to know. Just in case James denied that the baby was his. If he did, then the lawyer could ask Minerva who had bought the child her dres...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I can't!' she insisted, with miserable, sobbing hardihood. 'I--I--didn't write those letters, Charles! I only {{told her}} what to write! And not always that! But I am learning, O so fast, my dear, dear husband! And you'll forgive me, won't you, for not telling you before?' She <b>slid</b> to <b>her</b> knees, abjectly clasped his waist and laid her face against him.|$|R
60|$|Helen <b>slid</b> off <b>her</b> {{horse and}} fell {{with a little}} panting cry of relief. She {{saw that she was}} bloody, dirty, disheveled, and {{wringing}} wet with perspiration. Her riding habit was torn into tatters. Every muscle seemed to burn and sting, and all her bones seemed broken. But it was worth all this to meet Dale's penetrating glance, to see Bo's utter, incredulous astonishment.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly they heard, as {{they had}} heard many times before, the Miller {{shutting}} off the water. To the rattle and rumble of the labouring stones succeeded thick silence, punctuated with little drops from the stayed wheel. Then some water-bird in the dam fluttered her wings as she <b>slid</b> to <b>her</b> nest, and the plop of a water-rat sounded like the fall of a log in the water.|$|R
60|$|With {{a humorous}} sadness Pierre {{measured}} the large {{remainder of the}} one only piece she had touched, and then would have spoken banteringly to her; but she had <b>slid</b> away into <b>her</b> own room.|$|R
