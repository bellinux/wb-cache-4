40|$|Borate ester {{compounds}} {{are emerging}} as promising materials for lubricating systems. The main drawback of borate esters however, is the <b>susceptiblity</b> <b>to</b> hydrolysis. In this work, {{two kinds of}} N-containing heterocyclic borate esters were synthesized. Their hydrolytic stability and tribological properties as lubricant additives in rapeseed oil were evaluated. The results showed that these borate esters not only possessed promising tribological properties, but also had high hydrolytic stability. Thermal films and tribofilms were investigated by using X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy. Surface analysis indicated that thermal films were mainly composed of adsorbed films and thermo-chemical reaction products. Tribofilms were mainly constituted by BN, B 2 O 3 and organic...|$|R

The Kigezi goats {{appeared to be the}} most susceptibe suffering more severe anaemia, greater retardation of growth and more deaths than the other 2 breeds following experimental infection with Trypanosoma congolense. The Small East African goats appeared to be the least susceptible. Following treatment after 84 days of infection, the SEA goats responded much better than the other 2 breeds. By 4 weeks after treatment with diminazene aceturate, the packed cell volume of the Mubende and kigezi-goats were still much lower than those of control animals...|$|R

A system for the production and detection of the extracellular proteolytic enzymes produced by Septoria musiva was established using the synthetic medium, casein culture medium (CCM). An isolate of S. musiva (MP 1) showed a growth-limiting effect when grown in CCM that contained initial concentrations of 3 ̆c 60 mM glucose. SDS PAGE activity gels revealed two putative proteinases, P 1 and P 2 (M r 24 and 75 kd), in culture filtrates of MP 1. Proteinase P 1 was isolated and further characterized for optimum pH (8. 0) and reaction temperature (60 C).

40|$|Chlorosis of {{the foliage}} of higher plants has {{constituted}} a severe fertility problem {{in many areas}} of the world. It has been reported in no less than 30 countries. It has manifested itself in the western states and has usually been associated with a high CaCO 3 content in the soil. The problem considered here will be limited to the effects of age, and of calcium and bicarbonate ions on the uptake of iron by plants, and on chlorophyll formation. It is the hope of the author to determine which of the ions in the soil are conducive to 2 ̆ 2 lime-induced chlorosis. 2 ̆ 2 Great Northern beans were selected as experimental material in view of their <b>susceptiblity</b> <b>to</b> typical 2 ̆ 2 lime-induced chlorosis. 2 ̆ 2 These beans were grown in solution...|$|R

40|$|The genetic {{resistance}} of C 3 H mice to infection with a mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) 1 grown in Princeton (PRI) mice (1) apparently resides {{to a large}} extent in the macrophage system, since macrophage cultures from the resistant mice are resistant in vitro while cultures from susceptible mice grown under identical conditions are susceptible (2, 3). This can be tested by culturing macrophages from a group of mice and then backcrossing the mice whose macrophages are susceptible, to the inbred strain of C 3 H mice. Using this method, it has been possible to introduce the gene for susceptibility into previously resistant mice 3 Now, after some 20 backcrosses, a line of susceptible C 3 H mice is available which differs from the resistant C~H mice presumably by only one gene, the gene for <b>susceptiblity</b> <b>to</b> mouse hepatitis virus. The gene for susceptibility has remained completely manifest and dominant despite other factors in the genetic background of the C 3 H mice. Since susceptibility to this virus seems to be unifactorial, it is of interest to try to determine the nature of the difference between the resistant and the susceptible cells...|$|R

40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} {{is an increasing}} problem in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) treatment. Presently, third-generation parenteral cephalosporins, like ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, are the first option. Resistance to oral, but not to parenteral, third-generation cephalosporins has been reported previously. We analysed the microbial susceptibility (as minimum inhibitory concentration - MIC) of NG cultures obtained from high-risk visitors of the largest Dutch outpatient clinic for sexually transmitted infections (STI) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Among 1, 596 visitors, we identified 102 patients {{with at least one}} NG isolate with reduced susceptibility to cefotaxime (0. 125 mu g/ml < MIC <= 0. 5 mu g/ml). The percentage of NG isolates with reduced susceptibility to cefotaxime rose from 4. 8 % in 2006 to 12. 1 % in 2008 (chi(2) 17. 5, p< 0. 001). With multivariate logistic regression, being a man who has sex with men (MSM) was significantly associated with reduced susceptibility to cefotaxime (p< 0. 001). Compared to susceptible NG isolates, those with decreased <b>susceptiblity</b> <b>to</b> cefotaxime were more often resistant also to penicillin (16. 5 % vs. 43. 3 %), tetracycline (21. 5 % vs. 68. 9 %) and ciprofloxacin (44. 4 % vs. 90. 0 %, all p< 0. 001). The increased prevalence of NG strains with reduced susceptibility to cefotaxime among MSM may herald resistance to third-generation parenteral cephalosporins. A considerable proportion of these strains show resistance to multiple antibiotics which could limit future NG treatment options...|$|R

40|$|For {{the area}} of Slovenia (20. 000 sqr. km) a debris-flow {{susceptibility}} model at scale 1 : 250, 000 was produced. To calculate the susceptibility to debris-flow occurence using GIS several information layers were used such as geology (lithology and distance from structural elements), intensive rainfall (48 -hour rainfall intensity), derivates of digital elevation model (slope, curvature, energy potential related to elevation), hydraulic network (distance to surface waters, energy potential of streams), and locations of sixteen known debris flows, which were used for thedebris-flow susceptibility models’ evaluation. A linear model weighted sum approach was {{selected on the basis}} of easily acquired spatio-temporal factors to simplify the approach and to make the approach easily transferable toother regions. Based on the calculations of 672 linear models with different weight combinations for used spatio temporal factors and based on results of their success to predict debris-flow susceptible areas, the best factors’weight combination was selected. To avoid overfitting of the prediction model, an average of weights from the first hundred models was chosen as an ideal combination of factor weights. For this model also error interval was calculated. A debris-flow susceptibility model at scale 1 : 250, 000 represents a basis for spatial prediction of the debris-flow triggering and transport areas. It also gives a general overview of susceptible areas in Slovenia andgives guidance for more detailed research areas and further spatial and numerical analyses. The results showed that approximatelly 4 % of Slovenia’s area are extremely high susceptible and approximatelly 11 % of Slovenia’sarea of <b>susceptiblity</b> <b>to</b> debris-flows is high. As expected these areas are related to mountainous terrain in the NWand N of Slovenia...|$|R
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis forms part of an international programme concerned with the structure elucidation of the capsular antigens of some Enterobacteriaceae. Many of the Klebsiella {{and some of the}} Escherichia coli are pathogenic to man and, hence, they are of interest. The virulence of bacteria is a multifactorial phenomenon, in which characteristic traits of bacteria and their hosts play comparable and complementary roles. It is accepted that pathogens are more virulent when encapsulated, because, nearly all disease causing bacteria have a capsule when freshly isolated from the host. This increase in pathogenicity is related, in part, to the capsular polysaccharides' ability to avoid or attenuate the host defence mechanisms. In the majority of cases the protective aspects of the capsule are overcome in the latter stages of infection when the formation of specific antibodies by the host has occurred. However there are situations in which an immune state of the infected host is virtually never reached, and <b>susceptiblity</b> <b>to</b> the infecting bacteria is maintained even in the advanced stage of an infection. Explanation of this phenomenon becomes possible by analysing the structure of the polysaccharides. The inability of the host to raise an immune response to the capsule may be because the structure of the polysaccharide is similar or identical to the host's carbohydrates. The serological and pathogenic relatedness of encapsulated E. coli and Klebsiella, to the encapsulated strains of other genera, is based on structural identity or similarity of the respective capsules. Capsular polysaccharides are analysed by both chemical and instrumental methods, and, at present, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is the most important analytical techniqu...|$|R
