5000|$|Slewing unit: the <b>slewing</b> <b>unit</b> {{sits at the}} top of the mast. This is {{the engine}} that enables the crane to rotate.|$|E
5000|$|Operating cabin: on most {{tower cranes}} the {{operating}} cabin sits {{just above the}} <b>slewing</b> <b>unit.</b> It contains the operating controls, LMI, scale, anemometer, etc ...|$|E
50|$|Tower cranes are {{a modern}} form of balance crane that consist {{of the same}} basic parts. Fixed to the ground on a {{concrete}} slab (and sometimes attached {{to the sides of}} structures), tower cranes often give the best combination of height and lifting capacity and are used in the construction of tall buildings. The base is then attached to the mast which gives the crane its height. Further, the mast is attached to the <b>slewing</b> <b>unit</b> (gear and motor) that allows the crane to rotate. On top of the <b>slewing</b> <b>unit</b> there are three main parts which are: the long horizontal jib (working arm), shorter counter-jib, and the operator's cab.|$|E
40|$|Anthropogenic catastrophes, as a rule, {{are caused}} {{directly}} by severe violations of operating rules set for technical systems and devices. One accident is {{considered in the}} article, where the rotating section of a tower crane fell down. A conjecture based on calculations is proposed as to what could have possibly caused the fracture of a bolted joint between the <b>slewing</b> <b>unit</b> and mast shell...|$|E
