40|$|Laser {{scanning}} is a recently-introduced {{remote sensing}} technology that shows high potentiality {{in the context}} of the forestry resources management. The research group of the University of Udine, within an INTERREG IIIA Phare/CBC Italy-Slovenia project, developed specific methods regarding the use of LiDAR data for forestry applications. A specific methodology which makes possible to obtain the position of the single trees and their relative heights has been implemented. On the basis of the height distributions, using stand height curves relation already available in the <b>stand</b> <b>volume</b> <b>tables,</b> a method to derive the volume values of each tree is proposed. The paper shows the first results obtained with the above method in terms of diameter and volume estimation on the basis of laser scanning data surveyed in different composed forestry plots. A comparison between laser-based and traditional methods-based data is also presented. Some of the consequences of this different way to use the <b>stand</b> <b>volume</b> <b>tables</b> were analyzed, and an experimental procedure is proposed that seems to guarantee a sufficient reliability of the results, and their historical continuity.

The areas of grey alder stands in the period from 1978 to 2010 increased from 2. 1 to 43. 3 thousand ha in connection with the transfer to the forest fund of the former rural forests. Earlier forest inventory standards for this category of stands in the region were not developed. To compile a height and <b>volume</b> <b>table,</b> it was used the technique of I. I. Gusev (1971), which allow to minimize amount of sample trees. This technique is universal and can be used for other tree species. The field data collection was carried out on the territory of Kargopol, Velsk, Nyandoma, Arkhangelsk forestry units, the Kenozersky National Park and Dendrological Garden of the Northern Research Institute of Forestry. The result of the field work for the periods from 2013 to 2015 was 124 sample plots and 120 measured model trees for alder stand study.

The need for sound techniques and methodologies for volume estimates is vital to forest inventory at local or national levels. The available systems for volume estimation; standard <b>volume</b> <b>tables</b> and tariff system need to be tested under various situations related to area extent, species limitations, ages and size classes. Standard <b>volume</b> <b>tables</b> are based on an assumption of an average form factor along the entire limits of volume table; this constitutes a source of inherited error in <b>volume</b> <b>table</b> approach. The tariff system is assumed to overcome the inherited error and other limitations of the <b>volume</b> <b>table</b> as a result of incorporation of form factor variable in tariff equations derivation. The main objective {{of this study is to}} compare between the <b>volume</b> <b>tables</b> and tariff systems application for volume estimation using statistical procedure and the actual volumes as reference volume. The latter was calculated by the form factor method. Other objectives are to check upon the universality of tariff system, in relation to the limitations of standard <b>volume</b> <b>tables</b> (areas, species and ages), size classes, in addition to creation of relationships between the tariff values and other measurable tree parameters, to facilitate tariff values prediction. The study was carried out on three tree species, Acacia nilotica in plantation along the Blue Nile and Rahad riverine forests, Acacia seyal in natural stands at Okalma forest reserve in rain fed sector of Sennar state and Eucalyptus camaldulensis in plantation at Abugeli of the Blue Nile riverine forest. Statistical analysis was performed with JMP statistical software by SAS. For comparison between results of different volume estimating systems, effects of geographical areas, species type, and age on Volume Comparison Index (VCI) for both systems. Scatter plots, regression techniques were used to determine the effects of different systems on the Volume Comparison Index xi and relationship between different parameters, values and treatments as related to different systems. The results indicate that there is no significant variation between volume values estimated by tariff system, and the actual volume values (form factor method) for each of the three species while there are significant variations in volume values estimated by standard volume equation system as compared to the other two systems. The results indicated that, the general tariff system is consistently more accurate than the standard <b>volume</b> <b>table,</b> although the latter is species specific. The present study indicated that, form factor is a function of diameter at breast height (dbh) and height. Therefore, errors associated with the standard volume equations are due to the incorrect assumption of a constant form factor over the range of size-classes parameters of the standard volume equations. The application of the <b>volume</b> <b>tables</b> is constrained by inherited limitations to the site or locality, species type ages and size classes. Further to that, <b>volume</b> <b>tables</b> are characterized by inherited source of error even though applied for the species for which it is constructed. The application of the tariff system, overcome the error and limitations associated with the standard <b>volume</b> <b>table</b> as it incorporates form factor as a variable in tariff equations, indicating the universality of the system as it is simple and more accurate than the standard <b>volume</b> <b>table</b> under different conditions and species. The study provided evidence that the tariff system is a stand development measure as it is based on tariff numbers or form height classes which are characterized by increasing trend with age. Due to the strong relationship between top height and the tariff number, top height is the most convenient and suitable tree/stand parameter to be used for the determination of tariff numbers and in tariff system application.

The second aim was to estimate the volume growth of Shafa-Rud forest basin. Two northern and southern aspects were chosen in the middle latitude profile (800 - 1200 m. a. s. l) and on each aspect, 30 circular sampling plots were selected using the random blocking method. In each sample plot, six trees were chosen according to a predefined model for sampling the radial growth using an increment borer and for measuring other quantitative variables such as height of trees and diameter at breast height (DBH). Weighted local <b>volume</b> <b>tables</b> were calculated for each of the ecological aspects and were compared using t-test. Multivariate statistical analysis, Hotelling’s T 2 2 test, which was carried out on means vector of the four quantitative variables: diameter, height, bark thickness and radial growth, demonstrated that the difference in centroid of vectors was highly significant. The <b>stand</b> <b>volume</b> growths in the southern and northern aspects were found to be 9. 2 and 9. 5 sylve per hectare, respectively...|$|R
