5|$|Elk {{range in}} forest and forest-edge habitat, feeding on grasses, plants, leaves, and bark. Male elk have large antlers which are shed each year. Males also engage in ritualized mating {{behaviors}} during the rut, including posturing, antler wrestling (<b>sparring),</b> and bugling, a loud series of vocalizations that establishes dominance over other males and attracts females.|$|E
5|$|The {{attacker}} consciously stops {{just short}} of hitting the training partner, while still executing attacks with full speed and power. The attacker has primary responsibility for non-contact, at a given moment during <b>sparring,</b> and this typically occurs when one training partner has more experience than the other. This is normally the practice when one training partner is a beginner.|$|E
5|$|The defender {{actively}} avoids or blocks {{an incoming}} attack {{executed by the}} training partner. The defender has primary responsibility for non-contact, at a given moment during <b>sparring,</b> and this typically occurs with training partners of similar experience. This is normally the practice when both training partners are in the senior ranks.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} primary types of spars; the classic <b>spar,</b> truss <b>spar,</b> and cell <b>spar.</b> The classic <b>spar</b> {{consists}} of the cylindrical hull noted above, with heavy ballast tanks located {{at the bottom of}} the cylinder.|$|R
5|$|The film flashes back seven months. Tommy is {{a former}} boxer who almost made the 2000 U.S. Olympic boxing team as a middleweight. He works laying {{computer}} cable and earns money on the side as a <b>sparring</b> partner in a local gym. His lack of motivation has led his girlfriend Stephanie (Christina Chambers) to move out.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} a <b>sparring</b> match with Ichiro Miyata, which is {{actually}} a rematch from a previous <b>sparring</b> match with Miyata {{that took place in}} the manga series. After winning, Ippo take his professional boxer exam to begin his boxing career. He then enters the East Japan Rookie Champion Tournament, and after succeeding, he faces the West Japan Rookie Champ, Takeshi Sendo. Ippo later enters the Class A tournament where he wins his chance to challenge the Japanese Featherweight Champion, Eiji Date. After losing to Eiji Date, Ippo climbs the ranks again to the featherweight championship, where he faces Sendo, who has become the new champion. After becoming the champion, Ippo then defends the title five times.|$|E
5|$|Individual feeding territories vary in {{size from}} , with the general {{concentration}} of coyotes in a given area depending on food abundance, adequate denning sites, and competition with conspecifics and other predators. The coyote generally does not defend its territory outside of the denning season, and is much less aggressive towards intruders than the wolf is, typically chasing and <b>sparring</b> with them, but rarely killing them. Conflicts between coyotes can arise during times of food shortage.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally booms, {{and other}} <b>spars,</b> {{were made of}} wood. Classic wooden hulled sailboats, both old and new, will usually have wooden <b>spars.</b> When {{aluminium}} became available, it was adopted for sailboat <b>spars.</b> Aluminium <b>spars</b> are lighter and stronger than their wooden counterpart, require less maintenance and generally hold up better to marine conditions. Aluminium <b>spars</b> are usually associated with fibreglass boats, although one can still find a few early fibreglass hulled yachts that were equipped with wooden <b>spars.</b> On very large sailing vessels, the <b>spars</b> may be steel. Modern, high performance, racing yachts may have <b>spars</b> constructed of more expensive materials, such as carbon fibre.|$|R
50|$|In a {{fixed-wing}} aircraft, the <b>spar</b> {{is often}} the main structural member of the wing, running spanwise at right angles (or thereabouts depending on wing sweep) to the fuselage. The <b>spar</b> carries flight loads {{and the weight of}} the wings while on the ground. Other structural and forming members such as ribs may be attached to the <b>spar</b> or <b>spars,</b> with stressed skin construction also sharing the loads where it is used. There may be more than one <b>spar</b> in a wing or none at all. However, where a single <b>spar</b> carries the majority of the forces on it, it is known as the main <b>spar.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A typical metal <b>spar</b> in {{a general}} {{aviation}} aircraft usually consists of a sheet aluminium <b>spar</b> web, with [...] "L" [...] or [...] "T" [...] -shaped <b>spar</b> caps being welded or riveted {{to the top and}} bottom of the sheet to prevent buckling under applied loads. Larger aircraft using this method of <b>spar</b> construction may have the <b>spar</b> caps sealed to provide integral fuel tanks. Fatigue of metal wing <b>spars</b> has been an identified causal factor in aviation accidents, especially in older aircraft as was the case with Chalk's Ocean Airways Flight 101.|$|R
5|$|Males become {{extremely}} aggressive during musth. Size is {{the determining factor}} in agonistic encounters when the individuals have the same condition. In contests between musth and non-musth individuals, musth bulls win {{the majority of the}} time, even when the non-musth bull is larger. A male may stop showing signs of musth when he encounters a musth male of higher rank. Those of equal rank tend to avoid each other. Agonistic encounters typically consist of threat displays, chases, and minor <b>sparring</b> with the tusks. Serious fights are rare.|$|E
5|$|Rhee Taekwon-Do {{teaches the}} {{military}} style of taekwondo, closer to traditional martial art than modern martial sport in nature. Training consists of exercises {{that may be}} classified as: basics (group drill exercises; similar to kihon in karate), destruction (breaking), hyung (patterns or forms), self-defence, and <b>sparring.</b> Basics, destruction, hyung, and self-defence are similar to equivalent exercises in other traditional martial art schools. Rhee Taekwon-Do teaches the Chang Hon hyung.|$|E
5|$|Cage {{made his}} first {{appearance}} on TNA Impact! during the November 19, 2005 episode by engaging in a verbal <b>sparring</b> bout with Monty Brown. This led to a match against Brown to become number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on December 11, 2005 at TNA's Turning Point PPV event, which Cage won. At TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on January 15, 2006, Cage participated in his first TNA PPV main event by teaming with Sting to defeat the team of Monty Brown and Jeff Jarrett. Cage went on to defeat then-NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jarrett for the title on February 12, 2006 at TNA's Against All Odds PPV event.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Spar</b> {{continues}} to be a popular drilling and production platform design for ultra-deep water. In recent years, developers have introduced a number of design variations such as the Arctic <b>Spar,</b> closed centerwell <b>Spar,</b> and long <b>Spar.</b> As the industry moves production into ultra-deep water, the escalation in drilling costs, particularly for deeper more complicated wells, prompts the need to look for new deepwater floater designs, including <b>Spars.</b> This paper introduces some new features to the Truss <b>Spar,</b> including a radial wellbay layout and an adjustable buoyancy centerwell device. This new Radial Wellbay <b>Spar</b> design is investigated and compared to the traditional Truss <b>Spar</b> for the same topside and riser weights and subjected to the same environments. The base case assumes a drilling and production platform with the performance comparison made in terms of hull weights and dimensions and hull motions for post-Katrina Gulf of Mexico conditions. In general, the Radial Wellbay <b>Spar</b> offers a smaller hull with fewer mooring lines for the same payload while maintaining the <b>Spar’s</b> low motion performance...|$|R

25|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation by}} the NTSB showed that the wing's lower <b>spar</b> cap had extensive stress fatigue and had fractures through the lower <b>spar</b> cap, vertically up the <b>spar</b> web and into the upper <b>spar</b> cap. The lower wing skin also found signs of fatigue in the area adjacent to the cracked <b>spar</b> cap. An examination of two other similar aircraft showed that the area of cracking was hidden from view by other fuselage structure.|$|R
5|$|Gordon arrived off Port Napoleon on 17 September, {{hoping to}} find Rowley {{maintaining}} the blockade off the port in Boadicea. Rowley was however off Île Bourbon, <b>sparring</b> with Bouvet's frigates, and therefore Gordon only found Hamelin's squadron in the harbour. This force consisted of the frigates Vénus and Manche with the corvette Victor. Recognising that he was heavily outnumbered, Gordon sailed westwards towards Île Bourbon to meet with Rowley and pass on the location of Hamelin's squadron. French lookouts on shore spotted Ceylon but mistook her for a troopship due to her unusual construction. The sighting was rapidly passed on to Hamelin, who immediately gave chase with Vénus and Victor.|$|E
5|$|He {{also appears}} in games outside the Final Fantasy X fictional universe, {{and a younger}} version {{is a friend of}} the protagonists Sora and Riku in the Kingdom Hearts series. In Kingdom Hearts, Tidus appears with younger {{versions}} of Wakka and Final Fantasy VIIIs Selphie as an optional <b>sparring</b> opponent. The character makes a cameo appearance in , and is mentioned briefly in Kingdom Hearts II. A digital replica of Tidus is a boss character in Kingdom Hearts Coded, and he appears with Auron and Yuna in the board game-based Itadaki Street Special.|$|E
5|$|Marty (Eddie Jones) is {{a former}} boxer, now {{a high school teacher}} and boxing trainer/manager who had {{previously}} coached a fighter to a title shot, only to have the fighter leave him just before the fight. Marty and his business partner Diane (Diane Tayler) arrive at the gym where Tommy spars to scout his <b>sparring</b> partner. The fighter's manager instructs Tommy to make his fighter look good, but after he suffers a low blow, Tommy knocks the fighter out with one punch. The manager and the gym's owner angrily order Tommy from the gym but Marty and Diane chase after him, inviting him to train with Marty.|$|E

50|$|Square lashing {{is a type}} of lashing used to bind <b>spars</b> together. There are {{different}} types, but all consist of a series of wraps around the <b>spars,</b> and fraps around the wraps between the <b>spars.</b>|$|R
50|$|Early {{aircraft}} used <b>spars</b> often {{carved from}} solid spruce or ash. Several different wooden <b>spar</b> types {{have been used}} and experimented with such as <b>spars</b> that are box-section in form; and laminated <b>spars</b> laid up in a jig, and compression glued to retain the wing dihedral. Wooden <b>spars</b> are still being used in light aircraft such as the Robin DR400 and its relatives. A disadvantage of the wooden <b>spar</b> is the deteriorating effect that atmospheric conditions, both dry and wet, and biological threats such as wood-boring insect infestation and fungal attack can have on the component; consequently regular inspections are often mandated to maintain airworthiness.|$|R
5|$|Jarasandha is the nemesis of Krishna. No {{one other}} than Bheema {{or the other}} three {{mentioned}} earlier can defeat him, and the legend is that Krishna escapes to Dwaraka due to threats from Jarasandha, and his repeated failures in defeating the latter. This time Bheema and Krishna go in disguised form, as Brahmins(purohits) into the fortress of Jarasandha. There they request for a duel from Jarasandha. Jarasandha chooses Bheema as his <b>sparring</b> partner. During the fight, Krishna signals Bheema to tear Jarasandha vertically apart into two pieces so the latter will be killed for good. However the body parts of Jarasandha rejoin because of a boon he possesses, and he regains his life. After a few failed attempts, Krishna signals Bheema to throw apart Jarasandha's torn body parts in opposite directions. This time however Jarasandha dies.|$|E
5|$|On {{their way}} to King's Landing, the king's entourage has stopped to rest at an inn. While the {{recently}} promised Prince Joffrey and Sansa Stark are walking along the river, they run into Arya <b>sparring</b> with sticks with her friend, a butcher's boy named Mycah. Taunting the boy, Joffrey draws his sword and demands a duel, under pretext of punishing him for accidentally hitting Arya, {{a member of the}} nobility. Mycah and Arya desperately explain that she asked him to spar with her so she could practice. As Joffrey savors the butcher boy's pain and fear, Arya hits Joffrey while her friend flees. Enraged, Joffrey turns on Arya and is about to strike her with his sword when her direwolf Nymeria bites his wrist. Arya seizes his sword and throws it into the river before running into the forest, where she drives away Nymeria and hides until dark.|$|E
5|$|The annual Thanksgiving holiday is {{a fairly}} recent creation. Throughout the early 19th century, the U.S. {{government}} had declared a particular day as a national day of Thanksgiving, but these were one-time declarations meant to celebrate a significant event, such as victory in a battle. The northeastern states began adopting an annual day of Thanksgiving in November shortly {{after the end of}} the War of 1812. Sarah Josepha Hale, editor of Boston's Ladies' Magazine, wrote editorials beginning in 1827 which called for the nationwide expansion of this annual day of thanksgiving to commemorate the Pilgrim's first harvest feast. After nearly 40 years, Abraham Lincoln declared the first modern Thanksgiving to fall on the last Thursday in November in 1863. Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Congress ultimately moved it to the fourth Thursday in November. After some <b>sparring</b> as to the date, the holiday was recognized by Congress as an official federal holiday in 1941.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} <b>SPar,</b> {{an internal}} C++ Domain-Specific Language (DSL) {{that supports the}} development of classic stream parallel applications. The DSL uses standard C++ attributes to introduce annotations tagging the notable components of stream parallel applications: stream sources and stream processing stages. A set of tools process <b>SPar</b> code (C++ annotated code using the <b>SPar</b> attributes) to generate FastFlow C++ code that exploits the stream parallelism denoted by <b>SPar</b> annotations while targeting shared memory multi-core architectures. We outline the main <b>SPar</b> features along with the main implementation techniques and tools. Also, we show the results of experiments assessing the feasibility of the entire approach as well as <b>SPar's</b> performance and expressiveness...|$|R

5|$|After {{defeating}} Young Battling Nelson again, in {{a rematch}} set in Binghamton, Dyer lost on points {{a week later}} to Wisconsin fighter Pal Reed. He continued to appear at charity contests in the early half of 1919, mainly for the Boxers' Loyalty League, <b>sparring</b> {{with the likes of}} Tim Healy and Silas Green. By now Dyer's vaudeville bookings were far outnumbering his boxing appearances and {{in the latter half of}} 1919 he faced only a handful of opponents in paid boxing matches. These included a newspaper decision loss to Steve Latzo in May and a win over Johnny Evans in New Jersey in July. Between August and September Dyer was part of a touring boxing show organised by the Knights of Columbus, fighting for the entertainment of returned and injured soldiers. Dyer fought a few more professional bouts in America, a draw and a loss to Joe Egan and a newspaper decision win over Jimmy Gray, but by 1920 Dyer had left the country and had returned to Europe.|$|E
5|$|Ambrose's height, and the {{accuracy}} {{with which he}} bowled, {{made it difficult for}} batsmen to play forward to the ball; instead they were forced to play with their weight going back. His accuracy meant that he was effective if the pitch favoured batsmen. He bowled an effective yorker, and unlike other fast bowlers, used short-pitched deliveries sparingly, although he could bowl a hostile bouncer, and concentrated on bowling a full length aimed at the wickets. Ambrose rarely engaged in verbal <b>sparring</b> with batsmen, although in later years he occasionally inspected the pitch in an area close to the batsman before an innings began and rubbed his hands to suggest that he would enjoy bowling there. He always aimed to concede as few runs as possible when bowling, and frequently berated himself when he offered an easy delivery from which to score. Following his dismissal of a batsman, Ambrose often celebrated by pumping the air with his fists. With Courtney Walsh, Ambrose developed a reputation for performing at his best when his team seemed likely to lose, and he often took wickets in clusters which devastated the opposition. In addition, he was often most effective against the leading batsmen on a team; he was also capable of exploiting vulnerabilities in the techniques of other batsmen.|$|E
5|$|Beshear's initial rise to {{political}} prominence was interrupted in 1987 {{when he finished}} third in a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary election. The Beshear campaign's <b>sparring</b> with that of former Governor Brown, the second-place finisher in the primary, {{opened the door for}} political novice Wallace Wilkinson's well-financed campaign to achieve a come-from-behind upset in the race. For the next 20 years, Beshear practiced law at a Lexington law firm. His only foray into politics during this period was an unsuccessful challenge to Senator Mitch McConnell in 1996. In 2007, however, Beshear was drawn back into politics by the vulnerability of incumbent Republican Governor Ernie Fletcher, whose administration was under extended investigation by then-Attorney General Greg Stumbo, over violations of the state's merit system. In the 2007 gubernatorial election, Beshear emerged from a six-candidate Democratic primary – largely on the strength of his pledge to expand casino gambling as a means of further funding social programs like education – and defeated Fletcher in the general election. Beshear won re-election in 2011, defeating Republican David L. Williams and Independent Gatewood Galbraith. He was ineligible for re-election in 2015 due to term limits imposed by the Kentucky Constitution.|$|E
50|$|In 1941 {{the first}} {{civilian}} women were {{hired by the}} Coast Guard to serve in secretarial and clerical positions. In 1942 the Coast Guard established their Women's Reserve known as the <b>SPARs</b> (after the motto Semper Paratus - Always Ready). YN3 Dorothy Tuttle became the first <b>SPAR</b> enlistee when she enlisted in the Coast Guard Women's Reserve on 7 December 1942. LCDR Dorothy Stratton transferred from the Navy {{to serve as the}} director of the <b>SPARs.</b> The first five African-American women entered the <b>SPARs</b> in 1945: Olivia Hooker, D. Winifred Byrd, Julia Mosley, Yvonne Cumberbatch, and Aileen Cooke. Also in 1945, <b>SPAR</b> Marjorie Bell Stewart was awarded the Silver Lifesaving Medal by CAPT Dorothy Stratton, becoming the first <b>SPAR</b> to receive the award. <b>SPARs</b> were assigned stateside and served as storekeepers, clerks, photographers, pharmacist's mates, cooks, and in numerous other jobs during World War II. More than 11,000 <b>SPARs</b> served during World War II.|$|R
50|$|A <b>spar</b> {{is a type}} of {{floating}} oil platform typically used in very deep waters, and is named for logs used as buoys in shipping that are moored in place vertically. <b>Spar</b> production platforms have been developed as an alternative to conventional platforms. The deep draft design of <b>spars</b> makes them less affected by wind, wave and currents and allows for both dry tree and subsea production. <b>Spars</b> are most prevalent in the US Gulf of Mexico; however, there are also <b>spars</b> located offshore Malaysia and Norway.|$|R
50|$|The crab claw {{may also}} {{traditionally}} be constructed with curved <b>spars,</b> giving {{the edges of}} the sail along the <b>spars</b> a convex shape, while the leech of the sail is often quite concave to keep it stiff on the trailing edge. These features give it its distinct, claw-like shape. Modern crab claws generally have straighter <b>spars</b> and a less convex leech, which gives more sail area for a given length of <b>spar.</b> <b>Spars</b> may taper towards the leech. The structure helps the sail to spill gusts.|$|R
