In this paper we study the microbunching instability in velocity bunching. Our simulations show that the initial current and energy modulations are suppressed in velocity bunching process, which may be attributed to the strong plasma oscillation and Landau damping from the relatively low beam energy and large relative slice energy spread.

The first natural frequency of generally used wide spanning cables lies well below 1 [*]Hz where also most of the energy content of the wind excitation is to be expected. Aerodynamic damping is significant for the moving cables holding very low structural damping which leads to a <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> resonant <b>amplification.</b> This is particularly of interest regarding the support reaction which is dominated by the mean value and the so called background response.

Established PCR-based methods of isolating deletion mutants are widely {{used for this purpose}} in Caenorhabditis elegans. However, these methods are inefficient at isolating small deletions. We report here a novel modification of PCR-based methods, employing thermostable restriction enzymes to block the synthesis of wild-type PCR product, so that only the deletion PCR product is amplified. This modification greatly increases the efficiency of isolating small targeted deletions in C. elegans. Using this method six new deletion strains were isolated from a small screen of approximately 400 [*] 000 haploid genomes, most with deletions < 1. 0 kb. Greater PCR detection sensitivity by this modification permitted ∼ 10 -fold greater pooling of DNA samples, reducing the effort and reagents required for screens.

40|$|Elimination of the {{regulatory}} mechanism underlying numeral homeostasis of centrosomes, as seen in cells lacking p 53, results in abnormal <b>amplification</b> <b>of</b> centrosomes, which increases the frequency of chromosome segregation errors, and thus contributes to the chromosome instability frequently observed in cancer cells. We have previously reported that p 53 −/− mouse cells in prolonged culture undergo genomic convergence similar to that observed during tumor progression; early-passage p 53 −/− cells are karyotypically heterogeneous due to extensive chromosome instability associated with centrosome amplification, while late-passage p 53 −/− cells are aneuploid yet karyotypically homogeneous and chromosomally stable. Moreover, they contain numerically normal centrosomes. Through the microarray analysis of early- and late-passage p 53 −/− cells, we identified the BubR 1 spindle checkpoint protein, which plays {{a critical role in}} <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> centrosome <b>amplification</b> and stabilization <b>of</b> chromosomes in late-passage p 53 −/− cells. Up-regulation of BubR 1 augments the checkpoint function, which effectively senses the spindle/chromosome aberrations associated with centrosome amplification. We further found that BubR 1 transcription is largely controlled by p 53. In early-passage p 53 −/− cells, BubR 1 expression is low and the checkpoint function in response to microtubule toxin is considerably compromised. In late-passage cells, however, regaining of BubR 1 expression restores the checkpoint function to mitotic aberrations caused by microtubule toxin.

40|$|Massive gas {{injection}} (MGI) is a promising technique for reducing tokamak wall damage during disruptions, with reductions observed in both conducted wall heat loads and in halo currents, {{when compared with}} unmitigated disruptions [1]. It is unknown at present if MGI can prevent the formation and <b>amplification</b> <b>of</b> runaway electrons (RE) in future high-current tokamaks, so RE formation during MGI remains an outstanding concern. To avoid RE during MGI shutdowns, efficient delivery of injected impurities into the plasma core is desirable. This is because complete collisional <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> RE <b>amplification</b> is predicted to occur at very large total (free+bound) electron densities (ncrit 1016 cm- 3 in DIII-D). To achieve a rapid gas delivery rate, a flange holding six fast-acting gas valves was installed. With all six valves fired simultaneously, up to 1000 torr-l of argon could be delivered to the plasma edge in a pulse about 3 ms long. Previous (2005 and 2006) MGI experiments have suggested that rapid gas delivery rate is crucial for achieving large core impurity densities; this was confirmed in the present experiments. Schematics of MGI valves used {{in the last three}} years are shown in Fig. 1. In 2005, a single low-flow valve was used; this delivered about 1000 torr-l of argon to the plasma edge in a pulse about 15 ms long. In 2006, a single large-flow valve was used; this delivered about 10, 000 torr-l of argon in a pulse about 10 ms long. However, the initial (several ms) delivery of impurities was not much faster than the 2005 valve. To improve initial impurity delivery in 2007, six Fig. 1.

40|$|Stochastic {{resonance}} {{with white}} noise {{has been well}} established as a potential signal amplification mechanism in nanomechanical two-state systems. While white noise represents the archetypal stimulus for stochastic resonance, typical operating environments for nanomechanical devices often contain different classes of noise, particularly colored noise with a 1 /f spectrum. As a result, improved understanding {{of the effects of}} noise color will be helpful in maximizing device performance. Here we report measurements of stochastic resonance in a silicon nanomechanical resonator using 1 /f noise and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise types. Power spectral densities and residence time distributions provide insight into asymmetry of the bistable amplitude states, and the data sets suggest that 1 /f^alpha noise spectra with increasing noise color (i. e. alpha) may lead to increasing asymmetry in the system, reducing the achievable amplification. Furthermore, we explore the effects of correlation time tau on stochastic resonance with the use of exponentially correlated noise. We find monotonic <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> the spectral <b>amplification</b> as the correlation time increases. Comment: 7 pages, 6 figures, To be published in Eur. Phys. J. B (2009).

40|$|The {{neuronal}} mechanisms {{underlying the}} emergence of orientation selectivity in the primary visual cortex of mammals are still elusive. In rodents, visual neurons show highly selective responses to oriented stimuli, but neighboring neurons do not necessarily have similar preferences. Instead of a smooth map, one observes a salt-and-pepper organization of orientation selectivity. Modeling studies have recently confirmed that balanced random networks are indeed capable of amplifying weakly tuned inputs and generating highly selective output responses, even in absence of feature-selective recurrent connectivity. Here we seek to elucidate the neuronal mechanisms underlying this phenomenon by resorting to networks of integrate-and-fire neurons, which are amenable to analytic treatment. Specifically, in networks of perfect integrate-and-fire neurons, we observe that highly selective and contrast invariant output responses emerge, very similar to networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. We then demonstrate that a theory based on mean firing rates and the detailed network topology predicts the output responses, and explains the mechanisms underlying the <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> the common-mode, <b>amplification</b> <b>of</b> modulation, and contrast invariance. Increasing inhibition dominance in our networks makes the rectifying nonlinearity more prominent, which in turn adds some distortions to the otherwise essentially linear prediction. An extension of the linear theory can account for all the distortions, enabling us to compute the exact shape of every individual tuning curve in our networks. We show that this simple form of nonlinearity adds two important properties to orientatio...|$|R

We show the correlated dynamics of the nuclear spin ensemble and the electron and/or hole under optical excitation as a quantum feedback loop and investigate {{the dynamics of the}} many nuclear spins as a nonlinear collective motion. This gives rise to three observable effects: (i) hysteresis, (ii) locking (avoidance) of the pump absorption strength to (from) the natural resonance, and (iii) <b>suppression</b> (<b>amplification)</b> <b>of</b> the fluctuation of weakly polarized nuclear spins, leading to prolonged (shortened) electron spin coherence time.

The general theory also helps to put in perspective the wide range of existing theories on the problem of a single electron spin in a nuclear spin bath. Comment: 20 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|In {{fluorescence}} microscopy, {{when analyzing}} spectral components, {{it is common}} to record two (or more) greyscale images. Each greyscale image, referred to as a channel, corresponds to intensities in different wavelength intervals. If each pixel of a two-channel image is plotted in a space spanned by the two intensity channels a conventional scatter-plot is obtained. Single-coloured pixels are distributed along the axes, while colocalized pixels are distributed closer to the diagonal of the scatter-plot, and cross-talk (as well as noise) is observed as deviations of the single-coloured vectors from the axes. Detection of colocalized pixels is often based on a division of this 2 D space into different regions by intensity thresholding. We have developed a method for reducing the scatter-plot to a 1 D spectral angle histogram through a series of steps that compensate for the quantization noise which is always present in digital image data. Using the spectral angle histogram, we can quantify colocalization in a fully automated and robust manner. As compared to previous methods for quantification of colocalization, this approach is insensitive to cross-talk. In fact, it can also be employed to quantify and compensate for cross-talk, using either linear unmixing or fuzzy classification by spectral angle, ensuring complete <b>suppression</b> <b>of</b> cross-talk with minimal loss of information. Recently we started investigating how the method can deal with autofluorescence.
