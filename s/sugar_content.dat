40|$|This study {{investigated}} the changes in activities of sugar metabolizing enzymes (acid invertase, sucrose synthase (SS) and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS)) and <b>sugar</b> <b>contents</b> during storage at low temperature in lettuce head (cvs. ‘Shizuka’ and ‘Shisuko’). The acid invertase activity decreased while the SS activity showed a continuous increase during storage. In both cultivars and portions, <b>sugar</b> <b>contents</b> declined after 2 days of storage especially sucrose content. The SS activity and <b>sugar</b> <b>contents</b> had a significant negative correlation in both portions of ‘Shisuko’. However, a significant positive correlation was observed between acid invertase activity (soluble fraction) and <b>sugar</b> <b>contents</b> in the leaf portion of both cultivars. SPS activity did not show specific inclining or declining pattern throughout the storage time. Among the two cultivars, ‘Shizuka’ showed lower percentage of weight loss, degree of yellowing and respiration rate than ‘Shisuko’ which might be the reason for longer storage life of the latter...|$|R

5|$|In {{temperate}} climates {{there is}} a sudden movement of sap {{at the end of}} the winter as trees prepare to burst into growth. In North America, the sap of the sugar maple (Acer saccharum) is most often used in the production of a sweet liquid, maple syrup. About 90% of the sap is water, the remaining 10% being a mixture of various sugars and certain minerals. The sap is harvested by drilling holes in the trunks of the trees and collecting the liquid that flows out of the inserted spigots. It is piped to a sugarhouse where it is heated to concentrate it and improve its flavour. One litre of maple syrup is obtained from every forty litres of sap and has a <b>sugar</b> <b>content</b> of exactly 66%. Similarly in northern Europe the spring rise in the sap of the silver birch (Betula pendula) is tapped and collected, either to be drunk fresh or fermented into an alcoholic drink. In Alaska, the sap of the sweet birch (Betula lenta) is made into a syrup with a <b>sugar</b> <b>content</b> of 67%. Sweet birch sap is more dilute than maple sap; a hundred litres are required to make one litre of birch syrup.|$|E

In the production of sweet wines, fermentation may be halted before it has run its full course, leaving behind some residual sugar that gives the wine its sweet taste.|$|E

5|$|Riesling {{wines are}} often {{consumed}} when young, {{when they make}} a fruity and aromatic wine which may have aromas of green or other apples, grapefruit, peach, gooseberry, honey, rose blossom or cut green grass, and usually a crisp taste due to the high acidity. However, Riesling's naturally high acidity and range of flavours make it suitable for extended aging. International wine expert Michael Broadbent rates aged German Rieslings, some hundreds of years old, highly. Sweet Riesling wines, such as German Trockenbeerenauslese are especially suited for cellaring since the high <b>sugar</b> <b>content</b> provides for additional preservation. However, high quality dry or off-dry Riesling wine is also known to have not just survived but also been enjoyable at an age exceeding 100 years.|$|E

The effect of temperature on non-enzymatic browning reaction kinetics of the onion hydrolysate was determined. The browning index variation was adequately described by both the first- and the zero-order kinetic. However, the zero-order kinetic model was preferred because its fitting was higher.

40|$|In {{order to}} find a simple {{assessment}} method for sesame seeds, we investigated the relation among the taste components and taste and shape scores of 20 types of sesame seeds. Free sugars and free amino acids were determined by HPLC and total sugars using a spectrophotometer.

A positive correlation was observed between all <b>sugar</b> <b>contents</b> and the contents of total free sugars or free amino acids. In white sesame seeds, a particularly high correlation was observed between the contents of total free amino acids and fructose or glucose.

A positive correlation was observed between the overall evaluation scores and umami amino acids contents of black sesame seeds, {{as well as between}} the sweetness scores and all <b>sugar</b> <b>contents</b> of white sesame seeds.

So, during the ripening of nuts, the sweet taste of coconut water predominated according to the maturity stages.
