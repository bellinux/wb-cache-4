5|$|Californium {{can enter}} the body from ingesting {{contaminated}} food or drinks or by breathing air with <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> of the element. Once in the body, only 0.05% of the californium will reach the bloodstream. About 65% of that californium will be deposited in the skeleton, 25% in the liver, and the rest in other organs, or excreted, mainly in urine. Half of the californium deposited in the skeleton and liver are gone in 50 and 20 years, respectively. Californium in the skeleton adheres to bone surfaces before slowly migrating throughout the bone.|$|E
5|$|Erosion can be {{the result}} of {{material}} movement by the wind. There are two main effects. First, wind causes small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region. This is called deflation. Second, these <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession). Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation. An example is the formation of sand dunes, on a beach or in a desert. Loess is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, friable, slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, silty, pale yellow or buff, windblown (Aeolian) sediment. It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick. Loess often stands in either steep or vertical faces. Loess tends to develop into highly rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, areas with loess are among the most agriculturally productive in the world. Loess deposits are geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily. Therefore, windbreaks (such as big trees and bushes) are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of loess.|$|E

25|$|Static {{settling}} {{consists of}} leaving the must to let the debris settle: after pressing, the must is left to stand in a tank away from air. <b>Suspended</b> <b>particles</b> precipitate {{to the bottom of}} the tank. This is facilitated by the addition of pectolytic enzymes which are long chain carbons composed of pectic compounds. These pectins give a high viscosity to the juice, cut the <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> into shorter chains, and accelerate precipitation. Refrigeration of the wort is needed: if the fermentation starts, the release of bubbles of carbon dioxide would spread <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> throughout the wort preventing their deposition.

50|$|Saltation is {{a method}} of {{sediment}} transport that briefly <b>suspends</b> <b>particles</b> and then drops them creating a forward bouncing pattern.

This case has been plotted in Fig.  1, where the magnitude of the growth rate decreases with relaxation frequency of <b>suspended</b> dust <b>particles</b> increasing and these values decreases with wave number decreasing.

25|$|In chemistry, a colloid is {{a mixture}} in which one {{substance}} of microscopically dispersed insoluble particles is suspended throughout another substance. Sometimes the dispersed substance alone is called the colloid; the term colloidal suspension refers unambiguously to the overall mixture (although a narrower {{sense of the word}} suspension is distinguished from colloids by larger particle size). Unlike a solution, whose solute and solvent constitute only one phase, a colloid has a dispersed phase (the <b>suspended</b> <b>particles)</b> and a continuous phase (the medium of suspension). To qualify as a colloid, the mixture must be one that does not settle or would take a very long time to settle appreciably.|$|E
25|$|UV {{disinfection}} is {{most effective}} for treating high-clarity, purified reverse osmosis distilled water. <b>Suspended</b> <b>particles</b> are a problem because microorganisms buried within particles are shielded from the UV light and pass through the unit unaffected. However, UV systems can be coupled with a pre-filter to remove those larger organisms that would otherwise pass through the UV system unaffected. The pre-filter also clarifies the water to improve light transmittance and therefore UV dose throughout the entire water column. Another key factor of UV water treatment is the flow rate—if the flow is too high, water will pass through without sufficient UV exposure. If the flow is too low, heat may build up and damage the UV lamp.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{separated}} the marker <b>particles</b> from the <b>suspending</b> <b>particle</b> mixture solution using iso-tacho-electrophoresis technique, a novel quantitative ionic particle separation method, in the microchannel. A multiple stacking {{zone of the}} <b>suspending</b> <b>particle</b> was visualized with variations in electric field strength, pH value and concentration of the ionic solution. In particular, the electrophoretic mobility of ionic particle (fluo-rescein) was estimated based on the electrophoretic velocity value measured by the particle image velocimetry. As a result, isotacho-electrophoresis zones were clearly visualized as going downstream in the electric field. The particle migration velocity increased proportional to the applied voltage increase; it was also affected by the pH value variations in the ionic solution...|$|R
40|$|Suspension feeders are sessile {{marine organisms}} {{dependent}} on plankton and organic particles transported {{by the water}} column for food. This study focused {{on the distribution of}} four suspension feeders (Dendropoma maxima, Spirobranchus giganteus, Heteractis magnifica, and Tridacna maxima) in Mo’orea, French Polynesia based on current, <b>suspended</b> <b>particle</b> abundance, and substrate type. Both D. maxima and S. giganteus were more frequently present at the site with highest current flow and <b>suspended</b> <b>particle</b> abundance. The positive correlation between current and <b>suspended</b> <b>particle,</b> or food, abundance suggests that a stronger current transports more organic particles to a set location than a weaker current. In comparison, H. magnifica and T. maxima abundance and occurrence were not related to current. This is because they are less reliant than D. maxima and S. giganteus on the current for suspension feeding. In comparison, all four species studied showed substrate preference. The distribution of the suspension feeders studied showed varying dependence on current and substrate type. Since suspension feeders regulate primary production by consuming plankton, their distribution and abundance greatly affects marine food chains. Understanding coral reef food chains is vital for comprehending the niche suspension feeders’ fill in coral reef ecosystems...|$|R

25|$|The {{most common}} type of filter is a rapid sand filter. Water moves {{vertically}} through sand which often has a layer of activated carbon or anthracite coal above the sand. The top layer removes organic compounds, which contribute to taste and odour. The space between sand particles is larger than the smallest <b>suspended</b> <b>particles,</b> so simple filtration is not enough. Most particles pass through surface layers but are trapped in pore spaces or adhere to sand particles. Effective filtration extends into the depth of the filter. This property of the filter is key to its operation: if the top layer of sand were to block all the particles, the filter would quickly clog.|$|E
25|$|Restrictions upon {{smoking in}} bars and {{restaurants}} can substantially improve the air quality in such establishments. For example, one study listed on the website of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that New York's statewide law to eliminate smoking in enclosed workplaces and public places substantially reduced RSP (respirable <b>suspended</b> <b>particles)</b> levels in western New York hospitality venues. RSP levels were reduced in every venue that permitted smoking before the law was implemented, including venues in which only second-hand smoke from an adjacent room was observed at baseline. The CDC concluded that their results were similar to other studies which also showed substantially improved indoor air quality after smoking bans were instituted.|$|E
25|$|DDT is a {{persistent}} organic pollutant that is readily adsorbed to soils and sediments, which can act both as sinks and as long-term sources of exposure affecting organisms. Depending on conditions, its soil half-life can range from 22 days to 30 years. Routes of loss and degradation include runoff, volatilization, photolysis and aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation. Due to hydrophobic properties, in aquatic ecosystems DDT and its metabolites are absorbed by aquatic organisms and adsorbed on <b>suspended</b> <b>particles,</b> leaving little DDT dissolved in the water. Its breakdown products and metabolites, DDE and DDD, are also persistent and have similar chemical and physical properties. DDT and its breakdown products are transported from warmer areas to the Arctic by the phenomenon of global distillation, where they then accumulate in the region's food web.|$|E
40|$|Pollutant load {{estimation}} {{is often}} required to evaluate stormwater management {{issues associated with}} water quality and urban development. Land use (e. g. residential, commercial) is commonly employed as a base to spatially characterize the pollutant generation from urban areas. This paper demonstrates an alternative approach of using surface type (e. g. road, roof, grassed) to define suspended solids loads in runoff from urban catchments. Three case studies are provided to illustrate the potential of using this surface based approach. The case studies analyzed are 1) {{a comparison of the}} <b>suspended</b> <b>particle</b> loads generated from residential and commercial land uses, 2) an assessment of the effect of exposed areas of bare soil on <b>suspended</b> <b>particle</b> loads generated from a residential catchment and 3) an evaluation of the effect that widespread adoption of rainwater tanks may have on the <b>suspended</b> <b>particle</b> concentration of residential urban runoff. The case studies demonstrate that the surface based approach provides a fundamental understanding of the main contributors to stormwater pollutant load generated from urban catchments. This level of understanding can not be gained by the more generic and lumped approach of using land use to define the hydrological and pollutant generation impacts of urban catchments. The surface based approach is also GIS compatible as briefly discussed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The <b>suspended</b> <b>particle</b> size has an {{important}} effect on the settling velocity of particles, the penetration of sunlight into {{the sea and the}} transmission of sound. It is of importance to investigate the spatio-temporal distribution of <b>suspended</b> <b>particle</b> size. In this paper, a new empirical model was developed based on Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data for retrieving the median <b>suspended</b> <b>particle</b> size (d 50), and then, the spatio-temporal variation in GOCI-retrieved d 50 was analyzed over the Bohai Sea. The results showed that the new model gained the satisfactory retrieval results in the Bohai Sea. Spatially, median particle size in the Bohai Sea showed an obvious onshore-offshore gradient, which was smaller in the coastal waters, especially in the Laizhou Bay, the Bohai Bay, and the Liaodong Bay while larger at the Bohai strait and the northwest part of central Bohai Sea. Hourly variations of d 50 data depicted the short-term dynamics of suspended sediments. The daily-averaged d 50 had a similar pattern of spatial distribution and numerical values to the hourly data but with a distinct temporal variation. In addition, {{the findings of this study}} suggested the possible effects of tide, wind, turbulence and riverine input on the median particle size distribution...|$|R

25|$|Mars' {{atmosphere}} is so thin and wispy that solar heating {{of dust and}} ice in the atmosphere - not heating of the atmospheric gases - is more important in driving weather. Small, <b>suspended</b> <b>particles</b> of dust and water ice - aerosols - intercept 20–30% of incoming sunlight, even under relatively clear conditions. So variations in the amounts of these aerosols have a huge influence on climate. CRISM has taken three major kinds of measurements of dust and ice in the atmosphere: targeted observations whose repeated views of the surface provide a sensitive estimate of aerosol abundance; special global grids of targeted observations every couple of months designed especially to track spatial and seasonal variations; and scans across the planet's limb to show how dust and ice vary with height above the surface.|$|E
25|$|Limnology is {{the study}} of inland bodies of water and related ecosystems. Limnology divides lakes into three zones: the {{littoral}} zone, a sloped area close to land; the photic or open-water zone, where sunlight is abundant; and the deep-water profundal or benthic zone, where little sunlight can reach. The depth to which light can reach in lakes depends on turbidity, determined by the density and size of <b>suspended</b> <b>particles.</b> A particle is in suspension if its weight is less than the random turbidity forces acting upon it. These particles can be sedimentary or biological in origin and are responsible for the color of the water. Decaying plant matter, for instance, may be responsible for a yellow or brown color, while algae may cause greenish water. In very shallow water bodies, iron oxides make water reddish brown. Biological particles include algae and detritus. Bottom-dwelling detritivorous fish can be responsible for turbid waters, because they stir the mud in search of food. Piscivorous fish contribute to turbidity by eating plant-eating (planktonivorous) fish, thus increasing the amount of algae (see aquatic trophic cascade). The light depth or transparency is measured by using a Secchi disk, a 20-cm (8in) disk with alternating white and black quadrants. The depth at which the disk is no longer visible is the Secchi depth, a measure of transparency. The Secchi disk is commonly used to test for eutrophication. For a detailed look at these processes, see lentic ecosystems.|$|E

40|$|Laboratory feeding {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} study the importance of suspension-feeding in the protobranch bivalve Yoldia hyperborea at different <b>suspended</b> <b>particle</b> concentrations in order to evaluate {{the importance of this}} feeding strategy when compared with its known strategy of deposit feeding. Standard feeding variables (absorption efficiency, AE; gut passage time, GPT; ingestion rate, IR) were estimated by quantifying 68 Ge/ 14 C in dual-labelled Thalassiosira nordenskioldii fed to Y. hyperborea. For the first time, results were also used to estimate scope for growth (SFG) in a protobranch bivalve. Absorption efficiency was higher when Y. hyperborea was deposit feeding (87. 7 to 94. 8 %) than it was during suspension feeding (50. 1 to 71. 7 %), whereas GPT was similar in most cases and ranged between 8. 15 and 20. 11 h. However, IRs for suspended particulate matter (SPM, dry weight) were mostly negligible (< 0. 01 to 5. 77 μg PM h- 1) when compared with deposit feeding (2067. 4 to 6872. 3 μg PM h- 1), although in one case suspension-feeding individuals ingested 93. 7 μg PM h- 1. Scope for growth was always positive in deposit feeders (113. 8 to 372. 4 J d- 1), whereas under suspension-feeding conditions it was mostly negative and could not meet metabolic requirements. In addition, mortality of Y. hyperborea increased at <b>suspended</b> <b>particle</b> concentrations above 0. 085 mg ml- 1.
