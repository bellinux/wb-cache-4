Listeria monocytogenes has been isolated from various ready-to-eat (RTE) meat and dairy products formulated with sodium chloride; therefore, the objective of this paper was to review the effects of sodium chloride on the physiological characteristics of L. monocytogenes. The exposure of <b>L.</b> monocytogenes to <b>sodium</b> chloride may increase biofilm formation on foods or food contact surfaces, virulence gene transcription, invasion of Caco- 2 cells, and bacteriocin production, depending on L. monocytogenes strain and serotype as well as sodium chloride concentration. When L. monocytogenes cells were exposed to sodium chloride, their resistance to UV-C irradiation and freezing temperatures increased, but sodium chloride had no effect on their resistance to gamma irradiation. The morpho-logical properties of L. monocytogenes, especially cell elongation and filament formation, also change in response to sodium chloride.

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The surfmers <b>sodium</b> <b>l</b> l-rnethacryloyloxy undecanyl-I sulfate (MET) {{and sodium}} 11 - crotonoyloxy undecanyl-I sulfate (CRO) were {{synthesized}} and purified. Both contain a sulfonate and polymerizable double bond {{connected by a}} hydrocarbon chain. Sodium 4 -[11 - (3 -carboxypropionoyloxy) -undecyloxy] benzenesulfonate (PSA-MA) could not be synthesized successfully. MET and CRO were characterized by means of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), elemental analysis (EA), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), determination of the critical micelle concentration (CMC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and microscopy. MET and CRO displayed a liquid crystalline behavior. MET and CRO were used in combination with poly(diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) to form polyelectrolyte-surfactant complexes by common precipitation in water. These complexes were redissolved in methanol and cast in films. The cast films were investigated by wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) with regard to ordered mesomorphous phases. Due to the destabilization of the lyotropic phase, little order were observed in the complexes. MET was co-polymerized with styrene and methyl methacrylate, in different proportions, by means of free radical polymerization. The co-polymers were characterized by NMR and infrared spectroscopy (Ik) and analyzed by DSC, TGA and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). All analytical techniques showed that the co-polymers were synthesized successfully. TEM indicated a fine, lamellar micro-structure.

We create a consistent identification scheme where the L 0 band is identified with the eukaryotic (DEKA) <b>sodium</b> channel, and <b>L</b> 1 /L 2 (speculatively) with the bacterial NaChBac channel. The scheme created is able to account for the experimentally observed mutation-induced transformations between non-selective channels, sodium-selective channels, and calcium-selective channels, which we interpret as transitions between different rows of the identification table. By considering the potential energy changes during permeation, we show explicitly that the multi-ion conduction bands of calcium and sodium channels arise as the result of resonant barrier-less conduction. Our results confirm the crucial influence of electrostatic interactions on conduction and on the Ca/Na valence selectivity of calcium and sodium ion channels. The model and results could be also applicable to biomimetic nanopores with charged walls. Comment: 16 pages, 17 figures, 2 tables, 75 reference...|$|R

The volume of inflation solution, the intracuff pressure, the duration of anesthesia, the time elapsed to extubation after discontinuation of anesthesia, and {{the volume of the}} inflation solution and the air withdrawn from the ETT cuff were also recorded. RESULTS: Intracuff alkalinized 2 % lidocaine was superior to saline in blunting emergence coughing (p < 0. 001). The incidence of sore throat was significantly lower in the L group at the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) (p = 0. 02). However, at 24 hours after extubation, sore throat incidence was similar in both groups (p = 0. 07). Incidence of hoarseness was similar in both groups. Intracuff pressure in the saline group increased with time while the intracuff pressure in the lidocaine group remained constant. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that the intracuff alkalinized 2 % lidocaine was superior to saline in decreasing the incidence of emergence coughing and sore throat during the postoperative period in smokers...|$|R
40|$|Frankfurter-type {{sausages}} {{were prepared}} with potassium lactate, sodium diacetate and {{various levels of}} a mixture of potassium lactate and sodium diacetate. The development of Lactobacillus sake and Listeria monocytogenes and the sensory quality were compared with a reference product without any of these additions. It was shown that addition of 2 - 3 % of a solution, containing a mixture of 56 % potassium lactate and 4 % sodium diacetate to Frankfurter-type sausages inhibited the development of L. sake and L. monocytogenes bacteria inoculated on to the product during storage at 4 °C. L. sake bacteria were mainly inhibited {{by the addition of}} lactates and its water activity lowering effect, resulting in a shelf-life extension with 75 - 125 %. In Frankfurter sausage with 0. 1 % <b>sodium</b> diacetate <b>L.</b> sake was not inhibited, but the development of L. monocytogenes was retarded. The increase of L. monocytogenes also slowed down when L. sake numbers reached 108 cfug- 1, probably as a result of lactic acid and/or bacteriocins production in those products. A synergistic effect of the combined addition of lactate and diacetate was observed {{at the end of the}} shelf-life, where L. monocytogenes was inhibited in Frankfurters with mixtures of potassium lactate and sodium diacetate while some growth was observed in products only containing potassium lactate. Sensory properties of the product were not significantly influenced by the addition of 2 - 3 % of solutions containing a potassium lactate/sodium diacetate mixture. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|In Kenya, insecticide-treated {{mosquito}} nets (ITNs) {{distributed to}} {{pregnant women and}} children under 5 years old through various programs {{have resulted in a}} significant reduction in malaria deaths. All of the World Health Organizationrecommended insecticides for mosquito nets are pyrethroids, and vector mosquito resistance to these insecticides {{is one of the major}} obstacles to an effective malaria control program. Anopheles gambiae s. s. and Anopheles arabiensis are major malaria vectors that are widely distributed in Kenya. Two point mutations in the voltage-gated <b>sodium</b> channel (<b>L</b> 1014 F and L 1014 S) are associated with knockdown resistance (kdr) to DDT and pyrethroids in An. gambiae s. s. While the same point mutations have been reported to be rare in An. arabiensis, some evidence of metabolic resistance has been reported in this species. In order to determine the distribution of the point mutation L 1014 S in An. gambiae s. s. and An. arabiensis in southern and western Kenya, we collected larvae and screened for the mutation by DNA sequencing. We found high allelic and homozygous frequencies of the L 1014 S mutation in An. gambiae s. s. The L 1014 S mutation was also widely distributed in An. arabiensis, although the allelic frequency was lower than in An. gambiae s. s. The same intron sequence (length: 57 base) found in both species indicated that the mutation was introgressed by hybridization. The allelic frequency of L 1014 S was higher in both species in western regions, demonstrating the strong selection pressure imposed by long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLITN) /ITN on the An. gambiae s. s. and An. arabiensis populations in those areas.

Bacteriol. 88 : 48 – 54. 1964. —The {{nutrition}} of Leptospira canicola {{was investigated}} {{by use of}} synthetic media of suitable ionic strength. At an incubation temperature of 30 C, the minimal components were calcium, iron, magnesium, and ammonium ions, thiamine, and a fatty acid source; barium and strontium replaced calcium. Aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or methionine stimulated the rate and amount of growth; the best growth occurred in medium containing additional amino acids. Additions of cyanocobalamin or biotin permitted growth at 37 C. The stimulatory effects of added cyanocobalamin, biotin, pyridoxine, pantothenate, lipoic acid, or nicotinic acid were additive at 37 C, but not at 30 C. Fatty acids containing 14, 16, 17, or 18 carbon atoms supported growth; linoleic and linolenic acids were toxic. Glyceryl monooleate or trioleate, or Tween 40, 60, or 80 supported moderate to good growth; a mixture of monoolein and Tween 60, or Tweens 60 and 80 supported the best growth. Ten strains of L. canicola cultivated in a synthetic medium containing Tweens 60 and 80 attained cellular densities per ml of 107 to 4. 0 × 107 organisms. L. canicola cells, resuspended in medium containing oleic- 1 -C 14 acid, incorporated label primarily into cellular lipids; a lesser amount was located in the protein fraction, and only trace amounts {{were found in the}} nucleic acid fraction. The rate of incorporation was not affected by added <b>sodium</b> acetate. <b>L.</b> canicola was found to have fatty acid decarboxylase activity...|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} combining {{isoelectric focusing}} (Sephadex IEF) and fast protein liquid chromatography (Superose 12; Mono-Q) removed hemolytic activity (presumably a contaminant) from partially purified preparations of the multicomponent diarrheal enterotoxin produced by Bacillus cereus. However, when the separated fractions were recombined, hemolytic activity was restored, suggesting that hemolysis is a {{property of the}} enterotoxin components. Combined fractions exhibited a unique ring pattern in gel diffusion assays in blood agar. During diffusion of the hemolysin from an agar well, the erythrocytes closest to the well were not lysed initially. After diffusion, hemolysis was observed as a sharp ring beginning several millimeters away {{from the edge of}} the well. With time the cells closer to the well were also lysed. This novel hemolysin consists of a protein (component B) which binds to or alters cells, allowing subsequent lysis by a second protein (component <b>L).</b> <b>Sodium</b> dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and Western blot analysis showed that hemolysin BL has properties similar to those described previously for the enterotoxin and that both components are distinct from cereolysin and cereolysin AB...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the effects of resveratrol on hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) -induced increase in late <b>sodium</b> current (INa. <b>L)</b> which augmented the reverse Na+-Ca 2 + exchanger current (INCX), and the diastolic intracellular Ca 2 + concentration in ventricular myocytes. Methods: INa. L, INCX, L-type Ca 2 + current (ICa. L) and intracellular Ca 2 + properties were determined using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques and dual-excitation fluorescence photomultiplier system (IonOptix), respectively, in rabbit ventricular myocytes. Results: Resveratrol (10, 20, 40 and 80 mM) decreased INa. L in myocytes both in the absence and presence of H 2 O 2 (300 mM) in a concentration dependent manner. Ranolazine (3 – 9 mM) and tetrodotoxin (TTX, 4 mM), INa. L inhibitors, decreased INa. L in cardiomyocytes in the presence of 300 mM H 2 O 2. H 2 O 2 (300 mM) increased the reverse INCX and this increase was significantly attenuated by either 20 mM resveratrol or 4 mM ranolazine or 4 mM TTX. In addition, 10 mM resveratrol an...|$|R
40|$|Sesame seeds must be {{dehulled}} before processing for {{the food}} industry because the husk provides unde-sirable darker color and bitter taste. Currently, sesame seeds are mechanically peeled but this procedure requires high volume of water, which is a scarce resource {{in most of the}} countries where sesame is consumed by humans. In this study, several chemicals have been used in order to facilitate the peeling process and reduce the water requirement. The feasibility of using chemicals was evaluated by studying the color (instrumental and sensory) and the microstructure of seeds. Addition of both NaClO and H 2 O 2 before the mechanical dehulling of sesame seeds will be the recommended treatments for combining the dehulling and whitening steps of the sesame processing. This recommendation is supported by the high values of the L * and dehulling percentage and the low values of the color coordinates a * and b*. Besides, the scanning electron microscopy proved that the NaClO treatment was able to remove the hulls without causing damage to the cotyledons.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} whether microvascular damage occurs from superselecti ve intraa rterial injection of amobarbital sodium using the swine endovascular embolization model. METHODS: Thirty-four swine underwent percutaneous femoral puncture for superselective catheterization of the prox imal artery of the rete. Varying concentrations of am obarbital sodium were prepared (12. 5 to 100 mg / mL solution) in either normal sa line or sterile water (105 mOsm / L to 1138 m Osm / L) of which one concentrat ion was infused slowly into one ipsilateral rete. Control infusions were also performed. Histopathologic changes were evaluated at 30 minutes and 10 days after infusion, using standard light and electron microscopy techniques. RESULTS: Moderate vasospasm oc-curred only in three swine at 100 mg / mL amobarbital sodium in normal sa line. Light microscopy {{showed no significant}} histo logic changes in the retia {{at any of the}} tested concentrations of amobarbital sodium. Electron microscopy showed ultrastructural alterations in the int ima onl y at the higher amobarbital sodium concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Concerns for inducing significant dam age to cerebral microvasculature by superselective injection of amobarbi ta <b>l</b> <b>sodium</b> at the usually recommended concentrations and doses are probably not justified.
