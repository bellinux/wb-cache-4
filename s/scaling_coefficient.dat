5000|$|This paper {{introduced}} the [...] "Composite Plus Scaling" [...] (CPS) method which was subsequently used by most large-scale climate reconstructions of hemispheric or global average temperatures. In this method, {{also known as}} [...] "Composite Plus Scale", selected climate proxy records were standardized before being averaged (composited), and then centred and scaled to provide a quantitative estimate of the target temperature series for the climate of the region or hemisphere over time. This method was implemented in various ways, including different selection processes for the proxy records, and averaging could be unweighted, or could be weighted in relation to an assessment of reliability or of area represented. There were also different ways of finding the <b>scaling</b> <b>coefficient</b> used to scale the proxy records to the instrumental temperature record.|$|E
50|$|It was {{observed}} that the phylogenetic trees of ligands and receptors were often more similar than due to random chance. This is likely because they faced similar selection pressures and co-evolved. This method uses the phylogenetic trees of protein pairs to determine if interactions exist. To do this, homologs of the proteins of interest are found (using a sequence search tool such as BLAST) and multiple-sequence alignments are done (with alignment tools such as Clustal) to build distance matrices {{for each of the}} proteins of interest. The distance matrices should then be used to build phylogenetic trees. However, comparisons between phylogenetic trees are difficult, and current methods circumvent this by simply comparing distance matrices. The distance matrices of the proteins are used to calculate a correlation coefficient, in which a larger value corresponds to co-evolution. The benefit of comparing distance matrices instead of phylogenetic trees is that the results do not depend on the method of tree building that was used. The downside is that difference matrices are not perfect representations of phylogenetic trees, and inaccuracies may result from using such a shortcut. Another factor worthy of note is that there are background similarities between the phylogenetic trees of any protein, even ones that do not interact. If left unaccounted for, this could lead to a high false-positive rate. For this reason, certain methods construct a background tree using 16S rRNA sequences which they use as the canonical tree of life. The distance matrix constructed from this tree of life is then subtracted from the distance matrices of the proteins of interest. However, because RNA distance matrices and DNA distance matrices have different scale, presumably because RNA and DNA have different mutation rates, the RNA matrix needs to be rescaled before it can be subtracted from the DNA matrices. By using molecular clock proteins, the <b>scaling</b> <b>coefficient</b> for protein distance/RNA distance can be calculated. This coefficient is used to rescale the RNA matrix.|$|E

The steam is distributed at four different pressures through a combina-tion of control valves and a turbo-alternator. The steam load {{on each of the}} four pressure headers is dependent on the operating modes of two chemical plants; and can vary in magnitude from a situation of steam demand, to one of surplus steam. As part of an energy conservation pro-gramme, the distribution of steam has been optimised to provide the maximum possible utilisation of the turbo-alternator for all operating modes, consistent with chemical plant operation. An additional improvement in electrical power generation of 0. 25 MW was obtained by the applica-tion of a computer to the optimising loops.

Not L(u) but rather L(u 2) could scale with the typical size of the energy-containing eddies, so that L(u 2) determines the mean rate at which the energy is transferred from those eddies to the smaller eddies and is eventually dissipated into heat.
