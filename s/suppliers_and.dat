40|$|In a {{decentralized}} supply chain, {{raw material}} supply uncertainty, phantom orders of downstream firm {{as well as}} huge investment sunk costs leads to supplier's production capacity manipulation behavior. A supply chain consisting of a <b>supplier</b> <b>and</b> a retailer who faces a newsvendor problem is considered. The impact of supplier's production capacity manipulation on retailer's purchase decision is discussed. The retailer can adopt a menu of two part tariff contract regarding the terms of trade <b>and</b> capacity. Both <b>supplier</b> <b>and</b> retailer have prior belief about counterpart decision behavior. Then, we construct menus of two part tariff contract offered by the retailer to the supplier who has production capacity manipulation and type dependent reservation profits. Our results show that when capacity difference between type H <b>supplier</b> <b>and</b> type L <b>supplier</b> is higher than a critical threshold, the retailer offers two kinds of optimal menus of two part tariff contract in view of reservation profits difference between the type H <b>supplier</b> <b>and</b> type L <b>supplier,</b> <b>and</b> that both <b>supplier</b> <b>and</b> retailer's prior belief about counterpart decision behavior affect optimal menus of two part tariff contract.

These situations have touched on the concepts of animal rights, corporate responsibility and ethics, {{as well as social}} justice. While the majority of the disputes did not result in lawsuits, in many of the cases the situations raised legal questions, dealt with statutory compliance, or resulted in legal remedies such as changes in contractual procedure or binding agreements between parties. The resolutions to these legal matters have often altered the way the company interacts and negotiates contracts with its <b>suppliers</b> <b>and</b> franchisees or how it does business with the public.|$|E

5|$|Stringer also struggles, {{having been}} cut off by Avon's drug <b>suppliers</b> <b>and</b> left with {{increasingly}} poor-quality product. He again goes behind Avon's back, giving up half of Avon's most prized territory to a rival named Proposition Joe {{in exchange for a}} share of his supply. Avon, unaware of the arrangement, assumes that Joe and other dealers are moving into his territory simply because the Barksdale organization has too few enforcers. He contracts a feared assassin named Brother Mouzone. Stringer deals with this by tricking his old adversary Omar into believing that Mouzone was responsible for the vicious killing of his partner in their feud in season one. Seeking revenge, Omar shoots Mouzone but, realizing Stringer has lied to him, calls 9-1-1. Mouzone recovers and leaves Baltimore, and Stringer (now with Avon's consent) is able to continue his arrangement with Proposition Joe.|$|E

Both the <b>supplier</b> <b>and</b> the manufacturer invest in quality improvement actions in their production processes to reduce defective items being produced. In addition to quality investment, the supplier engages in outbound inspection before sending the components to the manufacturer, and the manufacturer engages in inbound inspection, when receiving the components from the <b>supplier,</b> <b>and</b> outbound inspection, before sending final products to customers. We investigate the <b>supplier's</b> <b>and</b> the manufacturer's quality investment and inspection strategies in four noncooperative games with different degrees of information revealed.

In court, Francisco Rafael admitted having sent Torresillos-Rendón and four other individuals to sell nine ounces of cocaine to the agent. He was arrested in California on 7 August 1980 and remained under custody until or around 8 September 1980 after paying a US$150,000 bond and promising to appear at every court session. Nonetheless, he fled to Mexico shortly afterwards and did not appear in court on 8 October 1980.|$|E

The wings and cabin floor were produced in-house, while Aeritalia provided control surfaces, Boeing Vertol made the leading edge for the wings, and Boeing Wichita produced the forward fuselage. The CTDC provided multiple assemblies through its constituent companies, namely Fuji Heavy Industries (wing fairings and gear doors), Kawasaki Heavy Industries (center fuselage), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (rear fuselage, doors, and tail). Components were integrated during final assembly at the Everett factory. For expedited production of wing spars, the main structural member of aircraft wings, the Everett factory received robotic machinery to automate the process of drilling holes and inserting fasteners. This method of wing construction expanded on techniques developed for the 747. Final assembly of the first aircraft began in July 1979.|$|E
