40|$|We {{introduce}} a topological quantum number [...] coined dynamical topological order parameter (DTOP) [...] that is dynamically {{defined in the}} real-time evolution of a quantum many-body system and represented by a momentum <b>space</b> <b>winding</b> number of the Pancharatnam geometric phase. Our construction goes conceptually beyond the standard notion of topological invariants characterizing the wave-function of a system, which are constants of motion under coherent time evolution. In particular, we show that the DTOP can change its integer value at discrete times where so called dynamical quantum phase transitions occur, thus serving as a dynamical analog of an order parameter. Interestingly, studying quantum quenches in one-dimensional two-banded Bogoliubov de Gennes models, {{we find that the}} DTOP is capable of resolving if the topology of the system Hamiltonian has changed over the quench. Furthermore, we investigate the relation of the DTOP to the dynamics of the string order parameter that characterizes the topology of such systems in thermal equilibrium...|$|E

Two iron-chromium-aluminum alloys and three-chromium alloys were used: GE 1541 (Fe-Cr-Al-Y), H 875 (Fe-Cr-Al-Si), TD Ni Cr, DH 245 (Ni-Cr-Al-Si) and DH 242 (Ni-Cr-Si-Cb). GE 1541 and H 875 were shown in initial tests to have greater oxidation resistance than the other candidate alloys and were therefore tested more extensively. These two materials were cyclic furnace oxidation tested in air at 1800 and 2000 F for accumulated exposure times of 4, 16, 64, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and and 600 hours. Oxidation weight gain, permeability change and mechanical properties were determined after exposure. Metallographic examination was performed to determine effects of exposure on the porous metal and electron beam weld joints of porous sheet to IN 100 strut material. Hundred hour stress rupture life and tensile tests were performed at 1800 F.

5|$|Wind is {{the flow}} of gases on a large scale. On {{the surface of the}} Earth, wind {{consists}} of the bulk movement of air. In outer <b>space,</b> solar <b>wind</b> is the movement of gases or charged particles from the Sun through <b>space,</b> while planetary <b>wind</b> is the outgassing of light chemical elements from a planet's atmosphere into <b>space.</b> <b>Winds</b> are commonly classified by their spatial scale, their speed, the types of forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect. The strongest observed winds on a planet in the Solar System occur on Neptune and Saturn. Winds have various aspects, an important one being its velocity (wind speed); another the density of the gas involved; another its energy content or wind energy.|$|R

We analyzed two cases: scirocco and bora <b>wind.</b> From selected <b>space</b> variable <b>winds,</b> we also calculated their uniform spatially averaged versions. In order to determine the optimal boundary conditions at the open boundary several simulations with PCFLOW 3 D model were performed. Their results sugested t h a t tidal boundary condition brought the most relevant results. Therefore, all further analyses were performed using the tidal open boundary condition. The results of simulations using space variable and uniform winds were compared graphically and numerically. The average absolute error has been identified as the most reliable estimate of precision for numerical analysis evaluation. Graphical analyses were then used for the interpretation of numerical results. The analyses shows that the differences between the circulation of the space variable and uniform wind are significant. At the end of the thesis, simulation results were compared to measurements. Despite the small number of measurements we found a better agreement between the results of the <b>space</b> variable <b>wind</b> as using the uniform winds results...|$|R

We study a Hamiltonian {{describing}} a pendulum coupled with several anisochronous oscillators, giving a simple construction of unstable KAM tori and their stable and unstable manifolds for analytic perturbations.

Background and history. A quasiperiodic motion of a mechanical system is composed of incommensurable periodic motions; the trajectory in phase <b>space</b> <b>winds</b> around on a torus filling its surface densely. An integrable Hamiltonian system has a great profusion of quasiperiodic motions: if one picks an initial phase point according to a uniform distribution, the trajectory will be quasiperiodic with probability one. The remaining trajectories are periodic. KAM theory deals with the stability of quasiperiodic motions, or persistence of invariant tori, under small perturbations.

40|$|The {{aeroelastic}} {{behavior of}} suspension bridges under generic temporal and <b>space</b> <b>wind</b> distributions is studied employing a parametric one-dimensional structural model {{coupled with a}} strip-based indicial representation of the unsteady aerodynamic loads. The aeroelastic response to spatially nonuniform gusts is also investigated. The equations of motion linearized about the prestressed aerostatic equilibrium are {{expressed in terms of}} incremental kinematic variables. The aerodynamic loading characteristics of the deck cross sections of the Runyang Suspension Bridge (over the Yangtze river in China) are evaluated by means of computational fluid dynamics simulations performed to extract the aeroelastic derivatives from which the indicial aerodynamic representation is obtained. The aeroelastic equations of motion are then reduced to the state-space ordinary differential form by using the Faedo-Galerkin approach. The reduced-order bridge dynamics and the description of the aerodynamic loading via the added aerodynamic states are solved simultaneously by using a time-integration numerical scheme. Dependence of the flutter condition and the transient response to gusts is shown through systematic parametric studies...|$|R

40|$|A {{widely used}} morphometric method (Macdonald et al. 1998) to {{calculate}} the zero-plane displacement (zd) and aerodynamic roughness length (z 0) for momentum is further developed to include vegetation. The adaptation also applies to the Kanda et al. (2013) morphometric method which considers roughness-element height variability. Roughness-element heights (mean, maximum and standard deviation) of both buildings and vegetation are combined with a porosity corrected plan area and drag formulation. The method captures the influence of vegetation (in addition to buildings), with {{the magnitude of the}} effect depending upon whether buildings or vegetation are dominant and the porosity of vegetation (e. g. leaf-on or leaf-off state). Application to five urban areas demonstrates that where vegetation is taller and has larger surface cover, its inclusion in the morphometric methods can be more important than the morphometric method used. Implications for modelling the logarithmic wind profile (to 100 m) are demonstrated.
