40|$|Abstract — Non-central {{catadioptric}} sensors {{became a}} mandatory effective tool {{in a broad}} range of applications and hence robust modeling and calibration for such sensors are required. One simple and efficient method is to model the catadioptric sensor by its catacaustics. Calibrating the sensor is equivalent to computing its catacaustics which fully geometrically describe the sensor. In this work, we calibrate non-central catadioptric sensors by computing their catacaustics using polarization imaging. We provide stable and accurate results by applying our novel practical method to extract required parameters. We have applied our method on a parabolic, a hyperbolic, and two <b>spherical</b> <b>reflectors.</b> In order to evaluate the calibration quality, 3 D reconstructions for multiple real world points were simulated assuming to have configurations with a perspective lens or a telecentric lens. 3 D reconstruction simulation from caustics using polarization for various configurations of catadioptric sensors is firstly presented in this work.

40|$|A {{process is}} {{proposed}} for fabrication of lightweight <b>spherical</b> <b>reflectors</b> {{in outer space}} for telescopes, radio antennas, and light collectors that would be operated there. The process would obviate the relatively massive substrates and frames needed to support such reflectors in normal Earth gravitation. According to the proposal, fabrication of a reflector would begin with blowing of a bubble to the specified reflector radius. Taking advantage of the outer-space vacuum as a suitable environment for evaporative deposition of metal, a metal-evaporation source would be turned on and moved around the bubble to deposit a reflective metal film over the specified reflector area to a thickness of several microns. Then the source would be moved and aimed to deposit more metal {{around the edge of}} the reflector area, increasing the thickness there to approximately equal to 100 micron to form a frame. Then the bubble would be deflated and peeled off the metal, leaving a thin-film spherical mirror having an integral frame. The mirror would then be mounted for use.
