Called D-Sight, it represents a revolutionary technique for inspection of flat or curved surfaces to find such imperfections as dings, dents and waviness. System amplifies defects, making them highly visible to simplify decision making as to corrective measures or to identify areas that need further study. CVA 3000 employs a camera, high intensity lamps and a special reflective screen to produce a D- <b>Sight</b> <b>image</b> of light reflected from a surface. Image is captured and stored in a computerized vision system then analyzed by a computer program. A live image of surface is projected onto a video display and compared with a stored master image to identify imperfections.

40|$|This thesis {{serves as}} an {{introduction}} to anyone that {{has an interest in}} artificial intelligence games and has experience in programming or anyone who knows nothing of computer games but wants to learn about it. The first part will present a brief introduction to AI, then it will give an introduction to games and game programming for someone that has little knowledge about games. This part includes game programming terminology, different game genres and a little history of games. Then there is an introduction of a couple of common techniques used in game AI. The main contribution of this dissertation is in the second part where three techniques that never were properly implemented before 3 D games took over the market are introduced and it is explained how they would be done if they were to live up to today’s standards and demands. These are: line of <b>sight,</b> <b>image</b> recognition and pathfinding. These three techniques are used in today’s 3 D games so if a 2 D game were to be released today the demands on the AI would be much higher then they were ten years ago when 2 D games stagnated. The last part is an evaluation of the three discussed topics...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} explores extending D Sight use on steady-state dynamic (vibrating) surfaces. The {{objectives of}} the research were: to determine if D Sight {{can be used to}} determine the mode shapes and location of nodes in a steady-state vibrating surface; to study the effect of varying the angle of incidence and determine an optimum angle; to correlate these results with finite element vibration analysis; and to determine if this method {{can be applied to the}} problem of locating subsurface debonds. It was found that as the angle of incidence increased the contrast of the image increased. A small angle of incidence was found to be optimum for a polished surface. The finite element vibration modeling found many mode shapes but seemed to miss some that were very evident in the experimental work. Otherwise there was a fair correlation between the mode shapes that were found in both. To look for debonds, a cross-brace was fastened to the back of a brass plate. Dynamic D Sight enhanced the image of the debonds although the debonds were visible even in the static D Sight images. In another case a point contact was fastened to the back of the plate. Again it was visible in the static view but in the Dynamic D <b>Sight</b> <b>image</b> it could be observed how the point contact affected the mode shapes of the vibrating plate.

The model is expected to be capable of predicting the extent of the corrosion within a joint in terms of thickness loss at the internal surfaces from the amplitude of the pillowing of the outer skin. The resulting out-of-plane displacements obtained from the model will be used to generate simulated D <b>Sight</b> <b>images.</b> D <b>Sight</b> is a simple optical non-destructive surface inspection technique that is capable of detecting changes in out-of-plane displacements greater than 10 micrometers.

Images are more manageable andeasier to assimilate than ideas. In addition, in the brain images consume less oxygen than ideas, and the former adaptto our cognitive environment more easily.

40|$|Aims. Previous {{work on the}} {{dynamics}} of the kink instability has concentrated on the evolution of the magnetic field and associated current sheets. Here we aim to determine the observational consequences of the kink instability in short coronal loops, particularly what images TRACE would record of such an instability. This paper concentrates on the internal m = 1 mode where the kink structure of the instability may not be apparent from the global field shape. This is most relevant to the observation of active region brightenings and coronal bright points. Methods. An existing fluid code was modified to include the TRACE temperature response function in order to calculate temporally and spatially averaged, line of <b>sight</b> <b>images</b> in the 171, 195 and 284 Å band passes for straight, kink unstable flux tubes. Results. Two new fluid effects of the kink instability are discovered: the circular enhancement of the density at the foot points and the appearance of a low density band running across the flux tube. The second of these effects is shown to be imagable by TRACE and hence would be a good candidate observational signature for an internal m = 1 kink unstable loop...|$|R
40|$|From the {{perspective}} of distributed cognition I will stress how abduction is essentially multimodal, in that both data and hypotheses can have {{a full range of}} verbal and sensory representations, involving words, <b>sights,</b> <b>images,</b> smells, etc., but also kinesthetic – related to the ability to sense the position and location and orientation and movement of the body and its parts – and motor experiences and other feelings such as pain, and thus all sensory modalities. The presence of kinesthetic and motor aspects demonstrates that abductive reasoning can be manipulative. We can also see, in this regard, how implicit factors take part in the abductive procedure, which consequently acquires the character of a kind of “thinking through doing”. This paper further describes 1) the fact that hypotheses in science can be built through different cognitive mediators and so they can also model the same cognitive aspect in different ways; how they can be carriers/ producers of knowledge in a multimodal way; 2) the problem of the possible non-explanatory and instrumental nature of abductive reasoning and the analysis of the consequences for induction; 3) the role of manipulative abduction in building new evidence/ experiments and how they trigger smart inductive inferences...|$|R
