Pedagogical staff takes the <b>special</b> <b>educator</b> as their colleague and they are not afraid to ask him/her for professional advice. These communications usually take place just between two of them without presence of another teacher. This bachelor thesis should serve as information for improvement of work with children with special educational needs.

30|$|The second {{question}} {{of this study}} was geared to find out the school-based intervention placements available for pre-primary children with special educational needs in Dodoma municipality. Responses from the informants showed that there were three school-based intervention programmes namely, inclusive classes, ordinary classes and special schools. First, inclusion with special educator: The study found that there were some children with special educational needs studying with their normal peers in general education classrooms under the guidance of a <b>special</b> <b>educator.</b> The researcher visited one of the six inclusive pre-primary schools, (school “E” as indicated in Table  3) and found three children in pre-primary class with special educational needs studying with their peers. Second, special schools: The study found that children with severe impairment were enrolled in special schools that were providing special educational needs in relation to the child’s disability. The study also found that there were only two special schools in Dodoma municipality; however, parents were being advised by school management to take their children to special schools outside Dodoma region for children whose needs may not be met effectively in these schools. The researcher visited one of such special schools particularly for the hearing impaired children located few kilometres from Dodoma municipal office along Dodoma-Morogoro highway. Third, inclusion in ordinary classes with no special educators: children with different levels of disabilities were also found in ordinary classrooms taught by general education teachers. The study found that some children were receiving their education in ordinary classrooms but without any support from <b>special</b> <b>educator</b> and they were without special instruments that could have assisted them in their learning. With exception of children in special school, (11 children) and those in inclusive classrooms under the guidance of a <b>special</b> <b>educator</b> (3 children in school E), the rest, that is, 16 children with special educational needs were found in regular classrooms with neither any <b>special</b> <b>educator</b> nor assistive learning devices for children with special educational needs (see Table  3). Teachers reported that parents normally ‘dumped’ their children with special educational needs in ordinary classes even if they were told that there was no <b>special</b> educational needs <b>educator.</b>|$|R
