Field isolates exhibited variable sensitivity to paromomycin and sitamaquine with respective mean 50 % effective dose (ED 50) values ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of 3. 9 ± 0. 3 μM and 2. 1 ± 0. 2 μM at the intracellular amastigote stage and 29. 8 ± 2. 5 μM and 17. 7 ± 1. 0 μM at the promastigote stage. Susceptibilities at the two parasite stages did not correlate for either drug. Isolates from high <b>SAG</b> <b>resistance</b> zones exhibited significantly lower susceptibility to sitamaquine than those from low <b>SAG</b> <b>resistance</b> zones, while isolates from different zones showed similar susceptibilities to paromomycin.

50|$|Recently, {{many states}} {{decreased}} the VOC limit from 450 g/L to 350 g/L limit for the specialty primers, sealers and undercoats category. As state regulatory agencies continue to introduce stricter legislation concerning VOCs, this will pose an even tougher challenge to manufacturers of solvent-based stain-blocking primers. In order {{to decrease the}} VOC of a coating, {{it is necessary to}} remove solvent from the formulation. This has the effect of increasing relative solids content (both pigment + binder) in the formulation, which has a negative effect on viscosity.

Our studies consisting of ClustalW, Phylogeny and TCOFFEE have pinpointed that ABC transporters have enormously diverged during the process of evolution even within the identical species strains resulting in insignificant homology and subdued conservation amongst the aminoacid residues. Moreover these amino acid residues remain susceptible to mutations in evolutionary era as indicated by high frequency of variations by the variability studies. Hence we predict that during the process of evolution a series of frequent mutations might have led to changes in the ABC transporters favorable to effluxing the drug thereby making the Leishmania species prone to resistance against the efficient first line drug SAG, used for combating VL. This selection has made them to survive efficiently in the adverse circumstances of antimony based antileishmanial therapy regime...|$|R

Since these antibodies are present even after cure, analysis of the parasite-specific isotypes and immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses in kala-azar patients may shed {{new light on the}} immune responses during progression and resolution of infection. Using leishmanial membrane antigenic extracts, we investigated the relative levels of specific IgG, IgM, IgA, IgE, and IgG subclasses in Indian kala-azar patient sera during disease, drug resistance, and cure. Acute-phase sera showed strong stimulation of IgG, followed by IgE and IgM and lastly by IgA antibodies. IgG subclass analysis revealed expression of all of the subclasses, with a predominance of IgG 1 during disease.

Results show that polymer molecular weight has a strong influence on both tensile stress growth and melt rupture data; increasing elongational strain rate decreases the stress growth coefficient, in all compounds. At any specific elongational strain rate, the stress growth coefficient increases with volume fraction of particulate additives and also when using additives of fine particle size, as a result of packing fraction effects. Acid coatings added at super-monolayer levels influence the viscosity of highly filled compounds, by internal lubrication. Dynamic extrusion data obtained by experimental blow moulding of calcium carbonate modified HDPE materials show that modifications to melt state shear modulus result in reduced die swell, to an extent determined by filler coating.

40|$|ABSTRACT THE EFFECTS OF COLOR CONCENTRATES ON THE RHEOLOGY OF TINT BASES Douglas James Herrick Waterborne {{coatings}} are formulated with {{a number}} of different ingredients; water, latex polymers, pigments, surfactants, dispersants, defoamers, biocides, coalescing aids, and rheology modifiers or thickeners. Rheology modifiers are necessary in order to improve the physical properties of the coating before, during, and after application to a substrate. There are two kinds of rheology modifiers used in waterborne coatings; associative thickeners and non-associative thickeners. Coatings formulated with associative thickeners are quite sensitive to coating variations; the slightest change in the formulation has profound effects on the rheology of the coating. The opposite is true for coatings formulated with non-associative thickeners, where the rheology of the coating is not affected by minor changes in the formulation. The rheological properties of coatings are most influenced by the latex, thickener, and surfactant components of the coating. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} most ideal balance of rheological properties come from using associative thickeners. However, when waterborne coatings with associative thickeners are tinted with colorants containing high levels of surfactants they exhibit a significant decrease in viscosity. This change in viscosity results in poor <b>sag</b> <b>resistance,</b> poor brush loading, and may also cause a reduction in tint strength of the coating. In this work, the effect of tinting paints with six different colorants on the viscosity of the paint was studied for four different paint formulations: a pastel base and a deeptone base formulated with hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC-type) non-associative thickeners, and a pastel base and a deeptone base formulated with hydrophobically-modified, ethoxylated polyurethane (HEUR-type) associative thickeners. Gloss values and tinting strengths were obtained in accordance with ASTM methods D 523 - 08 and D 4838 - 88. In addition, dynamic stress and frequency sweeps were taken in order to study the effect of colorant addition on the viscoelastic properties of each sample. Colorant addition had little to no effects on the viscosity of the bases formulated with HEC thickeners, while there was a dramatic decrease in viscosity upon colorant addition to the bases with HEUR thickeners. Similar results were observed in the viscoelastic property analysis: little to no effects on the elastic and viscous moduli was seen with the tinted coatings formulated with the non-associative thickeners, while both the elastic and viscous moduli decreased for the coatings formulated with associative thickeners. A few of the deeptone bases showed increased moduli upon tinting compared to the parent deeptone base. The addition of colorant resulted in a decrease in tinting strength and an increase in gloss for those samples with associative thickeners, while the opposite was found for those samples with non-associative thickeners...|$|R

40|$|The 1970 ’s saw {{the demand}} for more fuel {{efficient}} vehicles. This necessitated lighter automobiles, and was partly attained by lowering {{the weight of the}} coil springs used for the suspensions of these vehicles. Substantial weight reductions were achieved with new steels such as SUP 7, with their elevated carbon and silicon contents allowing the springs to operate at higher stresses. However, these steels are prone to decarburisation during spring manufacture, which sharply reduces the <b>sag</b> <b>resistance</b> and the fatigue strength of the springs. The literature pertaining to the decarburisation of high silicon spring steels is limited, despite the subsequent reduced sag and fatigue properties. The research detailed in this thesis was therefore undertaken to investigate the decarburisation of spring steels with 0 to 3 wt. % silicon for a range of temperatures and heat treatment atmospheres. The austenitisation of these steels was also investigated to provide complementary information. Austenitisation and decarburisation heat treatments were undertaken with 0, 1 and 3 wt. % silicon experimental steels, and the commercially available 2 wt. % silicon SUP 7 and SUP 7 NV steels. These five steels have similar carbon, manganese and chromium contents. Two dimensional austenite growth occurred for the different steels, with the austenite grain shape inherited from the initial ferrite grain structure. The austenitisation accelerated with increasing temperature, with the higher silicon steels exhibiting faster transformation kinetics at comparable intercritical fractional superheat temperatures due to the higher Ac₁ and Ac₃ temperatures. The austenite growth was controlled by the substitutional diffusion of the alloy elements at low intercritical temperatures, and by carbon diffusion through the austenite at higher temperatures. This resulted in the faster transformation of ferrite/spheroidal cementite initial microstructures than pearlitic microstructures at low intercritical temperatures, and the opposite at higher temperatures. Austenite nucleated earlier in ferrite/spheroidal cementite initial microstructures when the cementite particles were located predominantly on the ferrite grain boundaries of the initial structures rather than within the ferrite grains. The austenite growth eventually became faster for the latter structure. An increasing silicon content up to 2 wt. % increased the rate of carbon removal at comparable temperatures. Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that the mass of carbon removed during decarburisation increased with silicon contents up to 2 wt. %, with temperature, and with PH₂O/PH₂ ratios of 0. 01 to 0. 25, while manganese decreased the decarburisation. However, slower decarburisation resulted for the 3 % Silicon steel, especially at higher temperatures and lower PH₂O/PH₂ ratios, where a dense oxide layer strongly inhibited carbon removal. The decarburisation of the 1 % Silicon, SUP 7 and SUP 7 NV steels was fastest at their respective Ac₃ temperatures. Columnar free ferrite grain structures were obtained for the 0 % Silicon and SUP 7 steels, compared with equiaxed grains for the 1 % Silicon, SUP 7 NV and 3 % Silicon steels. The decarburisation of SUP 7 was fastest when the specimen was heated in the furnace with the heat treatment atmosphere already established, while slower decarburisation resulted when the specimens were annealed in inert atmospheres prior to the introduction of the decarburisation atmosphere. Different initial SUP 7 microstructures influenced the carbon release kinetics as the specimens heated to temperature. Prolonged decarburisation of SUP 7 and SUP 7 NV at 900 °C yielded decreasing free ferrite depths after 4 hr, despite continued carbon removal from the steel. This research contributes {{to the understanding of the}} austenitisation and decarburisation of spring steels. The information obtained is directly applicable to automobile coil spring production, but is also pertinent to the austenitisation and decarburisation of steel...|$|R
40|$|Mechanisms {{underlying}} {{grid cell}} firing in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) still remain unknown. Computational modeling {{studies have suggested}} that cellular properties such as spike frequency adaptation and persistent firing might underlie the grid cell firing. Recent in vivo studies also suggest that cholinergic activation influences grid cell firing. Here we investigated the anatomical distribution of firing frequency adaptation, the medium spike after hyperpolarization potential (mAHP), subthreshold membrane potential oscillations, <b>sag</b> potential, input <b>resistance</b> and persistent firing, in MEC layer II principal cells using in vitro whole-cell patch clamp recordings in rats. Anatomical distributions of these properties were compared along both the dorso-ventral and medio-lateral axes, both with and without the cholinergic receptor agonist carbachol. We found that spike frequency adaptation is significantly stronger in ventral than in dorsal neurons both with and without carbachol. Spike frequency adaptation was significantly correlated with the duration of the mAHP, which also showed a gradient along the dorso-ventral axis. In carbachol, we found that about 50 % of MEC layer II neurons show persistent firing which lasted more than 30 seconds. Persistent firing of MEC layer II neurons might contribute to grid cell firing by providing the excitatory drive. Dorso-ventral differences in spike frequency adaptation we report here are opposite from previous predictions by a computational model.

While this complex is preferentially nuclear localized, it can be redirected to the cytoplasm in the presence of an extranuclear form of EDS 1. PAD 4 and SAG 101 can in turn, regulate the subcellular localization of EDS 1. We also show that the Arabidopsis genome encodes two functionally redundant isoforms of EDS 1, either of which can form ternary complexes with PAD 4 and SAG 101. Simultaneous mutations in both EDS 1 isoforms are essential to abrogate resistance (R) protein-mediated defense against turnip crinkle virus (TCV) as well as avrRps 4 expressing Pseudomonas syringae. Interestingly, unlike its function as a PAD 4 substitute in bacterial <b>resistance,</b> <b>SAG</b> 101 is required for R-mediated resistance to TCV, thus implicating a role for the ternary complex in this defense response.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with local buckling and lateral distortional buckling, two aspects of instability that govern the design of composite beams in hogging regions. Local buckling in hogging regions of a continuous composite beam was modelled by moment curvature characteristics of a cantilever, modified by two curvature ratios, K 1 and K 2. Test based expressions for K 1 and K 2, {{in terms of a}} combined slenderness λc, were developed, and subsequently used in numerical analyses of 50 two-span composite beams to assess moment redistribution allowed for Class 2 beams by draft Eurocode 4. The analyses include effects of non-linear material properties, residual stresses and local buckling. The parametrical studies include adverse values, in relation to practice, of relative length of adjacent spans, span-to-depth ratio, and ratio of hogging to <b>sagging</b> moment of <b>resistances.</b> It is concluded that the redistribution of elastic bending moments allowed by the draft Eurocode 4 is safe and economical. Distortional lateral buckling of composite beams with both continuous and discrete U-frame actions was studied experimentally. Distortional lateral buckling was found in the tests of two composite beams with inverted U-frame actions. Web distortion was effectively reduced by vertical web stiffeners, which form a part of discrete U-frames together with the slab and the connection of U-frame. The work provides background to assess lateral buckling strength for composite beams with both continuous and discrete U-frame actions. A further theoretical approach on the topic of discrete inverted U-frame action was presented. Strength and stiffness of discrete U-frame connections were also studied. The strength of a discrete U-frame connection was found to be influenced by both the shear failure of concrete, and the yielding of steel top flange in the connection. A simple rule to assure strength of U-frame connections is proposed by checking these two failures separately. The prediction of shear failure of a U-frame connection is based on a truss model, and the prediction of failure in the steel top flange is based on a rigid plastic mechanism. A semi-empirical formula for flexibility of a U-frame connection was derived. They were all checked against test results. Interactive U-frame force and U-frame stiffness were also studied. A tentative design method for discrete U-frame composite beams was proposed...|$|R
