40|$|With the {{advancement}} in technology over the years, the administering of online surveys has expanded. In particular, universities {{are using the}} online medium to administer surveys to students, in order to evaluate faculty performances. The move of surveys to the online realm has meant a reduction in cost, time and efforts, of survey administrators, and the increase in use of technology within universities. With the use of online surveys the challenges of confidentiality, anonymity and response rates are as prominent as they are with paper-based surveys. This study researched the use of online surveys in education; detailing systems currently used by many universities to facilitate the creation of an Online Survey System that would solve the latter challenges. The principal idea was to create a system that would provide the Columbus State University Computer Science department with a web-based tool for creating surveys and administering them online. The surveys will be created by faculty members; Survey Administrators, and administered to students; Survey lakers. With the system, faculty members are able to create surveys for classes taught, providing questions and responses deemed suitable. Once a survey is administered, students can access the survey by logging onto the system. Upon authentication students are able to complete surveys online. Surveys are generated dynamically, depending on the survey criteria supplied by the survey administrator. The system stores survey criterion in a database, which is retrieved when generating a survey for a <b>survey</b> <b>taker</b> to complete. The system developed focused on providing functionality that would increase the convenience of completing evaluation surveys and protect anonymity of students. The created system was successful in its aim to provide these features, also providing ease for faculty to create online surveys without having the extensive technical expertise that is required to do so...|$|E

Material and Method:This descriptive study includes first line treatment physicians%u 2019 prescribing medication and general practitionars that work in the second line treatment hospitals (total N= 102) in the centre of Burdur, Turkey and its surrounding districts. There was no sampling for the study. All the physicians who agreed to participate were reached through a <b>survey</b> <b>taker</b> with a face-to-face interview between April 1, 2015 and July 7, 2015. 98 physicians participated in the study. The data from the study were analysed using the SPSS 17. 0 for Windows program. Measurable values were described as arithmetic mean and standard deviation, and countable values were calculated as numbers and percentage. Results: In the study including 98 physicians, 78 (79. 6 %) of them were males, 75 (76. 5 %) were married, and their average age was 40. 77 ± 8. 77. The leading factors affecting physicians%u 2019 prescriptions were post-graduate studies as cited by 82 (83. 7 %) and pharmacology lessons for 75 (76. 5 %). Drug company presentations were the least important factor, cited by 22 physicians (22. 4 %). The most important criteria for physicians in prescribing were {{the effectiveness of the}} drug as cited by 97 (99 %) and reliability of the drug for 96 (98 %). Also, 98 of the physicians (100 %) stated that patients asked them to prescribe certain drugs. However, only eight physicians (8. 2 %) indicated that they always prescribed the drug demanded by the patient while 88 physicians (89. 8 %) indicated that they sometimes did this. Discussion: Physicians are frequently asked by patients to prescribe painkillers and antibiotics. However, the physicians cannot always meet these demands from the RMU point of view.

We de-rive several million elections (more than all the existing studies combined) from a publicly available data, the Netflix Prize dataset. The Netflix data is derived from millions of Netflix users, who have an incentive to report sincere preferences, unlike random <b>survey</b> <b>takers.</b> We evaluate each of these elections under the Plu-rality, Borda, k-Approval, and Repeated Alternative Vote (RAV) voting rules. We examine the Condorcet Efficiency of each of the rules and the probability of oc-currence of Condorcet’s Paradox. We compare our votes to existing theories of domain restriction (e. g., single-peakedness) and statistical models used to gener-ate election data for testing (e. g., Impartial Culture). We find a high consensus among the different voting rules; almost no instances of Condorcet’s Paradox; al-most no support for restricted preference profiles, and very little support for many of the statistical models currently used to generate election data for testing. ...|$|R

Using only facial photographs, an average of 24 cases (75 %) were accurately diagnosed per clinician. Correct diagnoses were made in 90 % of classic CdLS and 87 % of non-CdLS cases, however, only 54 % of mild or variant CdLS were correctly diagnosed by respondents.

Radiology {{is one of the}} most high-tech fields of medicine. The digitization of medical information including radiographic data has led to improved efficiency and productivity but it has also presented new challenges in the area of privacy and security. In this study we have tried to answer some questions regarding how secure the current electronic radiology systems are and what individual and systemic factors affect the security and privacy of confidential patient data. A total of 77 radiologists and radiology residents participated in an online survey which included questions on physical security, computer systems security, and training and prevention. Since there was no objective way to measure overall security, we have used the overall security grade given by <b>survey</b> <b>takers</b> as our outcome, the dependent variable. Multiple regression analysis and ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) analyses were conducted. The regression analysis, with few exceptions, showed that only two variables contributed significantly to the final security grade. One of them was about unauthorized persons gaining access to the radiology facility, and the second one was about locking computer screens when temporarily away from a work station. A separate analysis was done using data for physical security, 4 computer systems security, training and prevention, and other security/privacy questions. Security threat level to current radiology systems is very low; however, the preparedness of these facilities to protect their infrastructure from future attacks is not adequate and there is room for improvement.

This paper will present the results of a survey of over 200 field linguists who conduct linguistic fieldwork {{all over the world to}} show that collaborative research practices are not evenly distributed. The most common types of collaboration reported by <b>survey</b> <b>takers</b> were: (1) changing a plan of research to meet community needs (55 % of survey respondents), (2) participating in language revitalization or maintenance activities (53 %), and (3) training community members in some way (52 %). In contrast, only 17 % of survey respondents had co-authored a paper with a community member who did not have a graduate degree and only 8 % had helped a community member obtain a degree in linguistics or another language related discipline. The survey results show that collaborative language research is more frequent if (1) the research is conducted in Canada, the United States, or Australia, (2) the language has clearly identifiable community leaders, and (3) the language research was initiated by speakers (i. e., the linguist became involved only after community members reached out). Furthermore, linguists are more likely to engage in collaborative research if they already have a PhD and have been working on a language for a long time. Interestingly, collaborative research was less likely if the linguist-researcher was also a community member. Finally, this paper will suggest some explanations for the observed correlations. It will be suggested that collaborative research is easier if the outsider-linguist shares some cultural background with the community. Moreover, if an outsider-linguist builds relationships in the community over many years, then collaborative research is easier. In contrast, insider-linguists coming from the community are constrained by social and political obligations within the community that prevent them from seeking collaborative research relationships...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of three essays about consumer judgment and decision making. In Essay 1, I develop a novel explanation for the well-known endowment effect - the tendency for owners to value goods more than non-owners do. According to a prominent explanation for this effect, the prospect of losing possessions creates psychological pain, inducing sellers to demand more than buyers will pay. My alternative account is based on transaction disutility: consumers are reluctant to trade on terms that are disadvantageous with respect to perceived market prices. The endowment effect appears {{to be caused by}} inflated selling prices because market prices usually exceed the value of ownership to consumers. But I show that reducing reference prices relieves sellers' transaction disutility, shrinking or eliminating the effect. Moreover, very low reference prices create disutility among buyers, resulting in disparities driven by a reluctance to buy, not to sell. Essay 2 explores the implications of transaction disutility for consumer preferences. Maximum buying and minimum selling prices are commonly believed to reveal preferences: a consumer who prefers one good over another presumably has a higher reservation price for it. But transaction disutility can distort reservation prices away from underlying values. If alternative measures of preference - such as binary choices between goods - are not regarded by consumers as transactions, they are not subject to such distortions. This difference can create preference reversals, that is, incoherence between explicit choices and the preferences implied by stated reservation prices. I find strong experimental evidence for this proposition. The "Bayesian Truth Serum" (BTS) is a survey scoring method designed to provide truth telling incentives for respondents answering multiple choice questions about intrinsically private matters: opinions, tastes, past behavior. (cont.) My final essay discusses several tests of BTS. In one questionnaire, respondents indicated their familiarity with various items (e. g. electronics brands), one-third of which were nonexistent foils. BTS did in fact reward truth telling: the scoring method severely penalized "recognition" of foils. Also, <b>survey</b> <b>takers</b> viewed the BTS method as credible: people who were paid for achieving higher BTS scores claimed to recognize fewer foils, even when facing competing incentives to deceive. by Ray Weaver.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, Congress, appellate, and {{district}} courts have made significant strides to improve patent law and litigation practice. Congress is now considering making more changes, to supplement ongoing tailoring by the courts. Dialog between the patent bench, patent bar, and lawmakers is crucial for informing these efforts. To support this dialog, we developed, in consultation with judges and company lawyers in spring of 2013, {{a list of questions}} to probe the experiences, opinions, and suggestions of lawyers. We asked <b>survey</b> <b>takers</b> to rate, on a range from ineffective to very effective, certain existing and proposed practices and interventions, and converted these scores into numerical ratings (of up to a highest possible effectiveness score of 100 %). Based on over 500 responses, about a quarter from in-house counsel mostly at large technology companies and the remainder from outside (law firm) counsel, we probed a number of topics, and made a number of findings. For example, the highest rated intervention of any on this survey was timely decisions on summary judgment motions (85 %) followed by timely decision on transfer motions (72 %). Early claim construction also rated highly (around 68 %). Among recent reforms, the FCAC e-Discovery model order ranked the highest in effectiveness among inside and outside counsel (43 %). However among many recent reforms, commentators said, too much variance in court uptake and implementations, due to the discretion given to judges, undermined their effectiveness. Among proposed legislative reforms, fee-shifting and sanctions for prevailing parties and for discovery abuses rated most favorably (~ 65 %). Based on about one hundred outside counsel responses, discovery abuses, followed by frivolous claims/defenses, were in the greatest need of sanction or shifting. Respondents also identified abuses that tended to be particular to plaintiffs: evasive discovery responses, overly burdensome or excessive discovery requests, frivolous/meritless claims, and unreasonable claim construction positions; as well as to defendants: stalling or failing to provide requested information, hiding non-infringement positions, and unreasonably delaying or asking for late trial dates. 86 % of in-house counsel reported that their company’s customers had received PAE demands based on the use or implementation or the company’s products. With respect to trends in patent monetization, there was a split in responses – slightly more than half of respondents indicated that the company had not experienced greater pressure to monetize, while slightly less than half indicated that their company had either monetized (23 %) or were thinking of doing so (28 %) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{produced}} {{in order to make}} steps in the field of parametric design for engineering. Currently there is a wide variety of tools available of made within companies. But they commonly lack the possibility for iterating and teamwork. Furthermore many of these scripts make use of optimization. However the conditions are often not specified, which results in nontransparent decision making. The result {{can be used as a}} way to identify possibilities in the manufacturing of geometrically complex projects. It will give insight in the combination of different design considerations with a focus on engineering aspects. It will streamline the process to compare different outcomes and priorities. The specific challenges will be used to draw a more general conclusion. Approach to these challenges is a symbiosis of case studies and surveys. The results and experiences from these aspects will be combined to develop a general workflow proposal and a more specific workflow for the delegated company. The case studies come from the portfolio of Royal IHC Architectural Fabrication. The three cases have an increasingly complexity in their challenges. These cases are analyzed to distill their key opportunities for optimization. Following a parametric strategy is developed and described to measure these goals. This can be a combination of objective and subjective goals, which created the need for human consideration. The results of this analysis are then compared by recording the genome and fitness data. The data is visualized in coordinate systems, that assist in making decisions. Filters are then be applied to either the parameters or the fitness in order to find a spectrum for further assessment. The surveys were taken at a spectrum of companies related to architectural design. To create the material for the surveys, draft results of the case studies were used. The <b>surveys</b> <b>takers</b> were confronted with the results the optimizations and asked to respond in respect to the used strategy. The first survey was taken during the time of the running case studies. This way results could directly be implemented in the research. The second survey was done with the results in retrospect. A draft of the proposed workflow was presented and explained. Takers responded with their professional opinion on this strategic matter. The proposed strategy is based on a layered structure. Optimize and review using the three different categories. By clearly visualizing the date all solutions can be considered properly.

The present research examines the perception of Donald Trump through the interpretive guides and theoretical lenses of Symbolic Interaction Theory, Communication leadership, Critical Theory of Communication in Organizations, and Securitization theory, to see if what Donald Trump says and his ideologies would be perceived differently, if what he says was stated by individuals of a different gender and/or race. This research wanted to find out: Does swapping race and gender of Communicators affect perspectives on Leadership & Securitization? The method used to test this research question were two online surveys created using actual Donald Trump quotes concerning leadership or securitization as their field of reference. The research was conducted with the participation of 30 respondents divided evenly into two groups, Group A and group B, with each group given a different survey. Each survey contained 12 questions asking survey respondents on their 6 feelings on each Donald Trump quote or scenario. Group A was given the Donald Trump Survey, which had 11 Trump quotes and one scenario all accompanied by a Trump picture. Group B was given the Gender/Race Swap Survey which had the same Donald Trump quotes and scenario, but was accompanied by a picture of an individual of a different race and/or gender. Also the Donald Trump quotes in Group B’s survey were assigned and designated as originating from the particular individual in the picture, with <b>survey</b> <b>takers</b> in group B not made aware that the quote originally came from Donald Trump. The questions revolved around leadership communication and securitization. The results showed that gender and race both played a large role in altering viewpoints on leadership and securitization when survey respondents were asked their opinions on specific quotes and statements from Donald Trump, versus when they read the same quotes and statements but these quotes and statements were assigned to an individual of a different race and/ or gender. The findings suggest that when the exact same remarks that were stated by President Donald Trump were attributed to another individual of a different gender and/or race, negative bias accredited to Donald Trump from group A was significantly reduced in Group B, and the remark was in many cases seen as a positive proclamation and point of view. Thus the gender and/or race, of the source of the viewpoint, may change interpersonal communication response attitudes, and therefore represent a compelling insight for examining communication phenomena, such as leadership, securitization, and intercultural communication...|$|R
40|$|Spatial data {{is playing}} a bigger role within many fields outside of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial analysis. With more and more users with varying levels of {{previous}} spatial analysis experience using this kind of data, {{there is a growing}} demand on how this information is best presented to the user. This user-centered design is an increasingly common theme in other adjacent fields, but {{is still in its infancy}} in the field of GIS. Currently there is no obvious generalized solution that provides the answer to how to present data, no matter if it is spatial or not. How to present data in a smart and comprehensive way is still an everyday challenge across many fields. The objective of this thesis is to create a prototype of a web based Network Information System (NIS) where the layman user is in the center of the entire design process. This includes both the actual visualizations, but also the choice of tools and the interface design. The prototype is designed around the role of the customer service representative in a utility company using a NIS. This type of layman user is the kind of user that today works in a system that is designed with neither their role nor their GIT experience or training in mind. From this prototype, the efficacy of different visualization techniques on layman users is evaluated, producing more general guidelines for user-centered development directed at layman users. The first step of this user-centered design process is to understand the user. By interviewing users of the system, their current work flows and opinions of their current system are better understood. From this, information about which tools they need, which current features work well and which need revising is gathered. Based on this, a mock-up is created which is then transformed into a prototype. Finally, the prototype is evaluated by the target audience with comments on a presentation as well as a larger survey. The results show that in general the prototype is well-received with regards to existing functionality and how it is presented through the interface design. The implemented visualizations are well understood by most of the expert users, but are less successful with the layman users in the survey. Especially with regards to the icon choices and other point representations, there is a discrepancy between the intended visualization and the perception of the <b>survey</b> <b>takers,</b> which may partly be due to the lack of context presented. An appreciated fact is that the functionality implemented in the prototype is tailored to the requirements put forth by the users. User-centric design processes depend heavily on the developer's understanding of the user and their needs. This is as true for functionality as for visualizations, where familiarity and associations can be both beneficial and detrimental, depending on how well understood they are. Using icons to represent objects is very efficient, as long as the context and the meaning of the icons themselves are well defined and conveyed. Finally, it is imperative to not throw too much information at the user. Whether in the shape of too many tools and options, or by displaying too much on the map, the same clutter-problem occurs. When presenting a situation or a scenario, the core message cannot be obfuscated by unnecessary features, functions or choices...|$|R
40|$|This project {{examined}} cyclist {{red light}} running behavior using two data sets. Previous studies of cyclist compliance {{have investigated the}} tendencies of cyclists to run red lights on the whole by generalizing different maneuvers to their end outcome, running a red light. This project differentiates between {{the different types of}} red light running and focuses on the most egregious case, gap acceptance, which is when a cyclist runs a red light by accepting a gap in opposing traffic. Using video data, a mathematical model of cyclist red light running was developed for gap acceptance. Similar to other studies, this analysis utilized only information about the cyclist, intersection, and scenario that can be outwardly observed. This analysis found that the number of cyclists already waiting at the signal, the presence of a vehicle in the adjacent lane, and female sex were deterrents to red light running. Conversely, certain types of signal phasing, witnessing a violation, and lack of helmet increased the odds that a cyclist would run the red light. Interestingly, while women in general are less likely to run a red light, those who witnessed a violation were even more prone that men who had witnessed a violation to follow suit and run the red light themselves. It is likely that the differing socialization of women and men leads to different effects of witnessing a previous violator. The analysis also confirmed that a small subset of cyclists, similar to that found in the general population, are more prone to traffic violations. These cyclists are more willing to engage in multiple biking-related risk factors that include not wearing a helmet and running red lights. Although the model has definite explanatory power regarding decisions of cyclist compliance, much {{of the variance in the}} compliance choices of the sample is left unexplained. This points toward the influence of other, not outwardly observable variables on the decision to run a red light. Analysis of survey data from cyclists further confirms that individual characteristics not visible to the observer interact with intersection, scenario, and visible cyclist characteristics to result in a decision to comply (or not) with a traffic signal. Furthermore, cyclist characteristics, in general, and unobservable individual characteristics, specifically, play a larger role in compliance decisions as the number of compliance-inducing intersection traits (e. g. conflicting traffic volume) decrease. One such unobservable trait is the regard for the law by some cyclists, which becomes a more important determinant of compliance at simpler intersections. Cyclists were also shown to choose non-compliance if they questioned the validity of the red indication for them, as cyclists. The video and survey data have some comparable findings. For instance, the relationship of age to compliance was explored in both data analyses. Age was not found to be a significant predictor of non-compliance in the video data analysis while it was negatively correlated with stated non-compliance for two of the survey intersections. Gender, while having significant effects on non-compliance in the video dataset, did not emerge as an important factor in the stated non-compliance of <b>survey</b> <b>takers.</b> Helmet use had a consistent relationship with compliance between the video and survey datasets. Helmet use was positively associated with compliance in the video data and negatively associated with revealed non-compliance at two of the survey intersections. When coupled with the positive association between normlessness and stated willingness to run a red light, the relationship between helmet use and compliance solidifies the notion that a class of cyclists is more likely to consistently violate signals. It points towards a link between red light running and individuals who do not adhere to social norms and policies as strictly as others. Variables representing cyclists and motorists waiting at the signal were positively related to signal compliance in the video data. While an increased number of cyclists may be a physical deterrent to red light running, part of the influence on compliance that this variable and the variable representing the presence of a vehicle may be due to accountability of cyclists to other road users. This relationship, however, was not revealed in the stated non-compliance data from the survey. Efforts to increase cyclist compliance may not be worth a jurisdiction 2 ̆ 7 s resources since nearly 90...|$|R
