50|$|Most {{of their}} efforts have been aimed at {{restoring}} the original decorative splendor of the house. On the inside, the molding on the plaster ceilings has been added and the dining room molding restored. Outside, they replaced the front verandah balusters and rear verandah columns with parts meant to be {{as close to the}} original as possible. In the early 21st century the main <b>stair's</b> <b>balusters</b> and newel posts were replaced.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} still {{contains some}} very fine examples of original {{baroque and rococo}} interiors. These include two fine tiled stoves as well as stucco decorations, some of them possibly executed by master stucco craftsman Johann Michael Graff, who is famous for his extraordinary work at RundƒÅle Palace in Latvia. In the 19th century, further additions to the interior were made, such as the study with its richly carved and decorated wainscoting, neo-baroque stoves and <b>stair</b> <b>balusters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Early {{internal}} fabric remains where later fit-outs {{have been}} {{inserted into the}} former Cafe Alexandra space {{on the ground floor}} including wall-paper, timber <b>stairs,</b> posts and <b>balusters,</b> timber wall linings and decorative cornices.|$|R
50|$|P. B. and H. Moulding Company was {{established}} in 1891. By 1894, Joseph S. Caldwell, Planing and Moulding Mill was in business at 247 Tallman Street. The company manufactured <b>stair</b> rails, newels, <b>balusters,</b> wood mantels and plinth blocks.|$|R

A green marble fireplace with cast iron grate and ceramic tiled reveal is in the office adjacent to the side hallway and main stair.|$|R
50|$|Catesby House is a Jacobethan {{country house}} about 400 yd west of Upper Catesby. It {{was built in}} 1863 and {{enlarged}} in 1894. It includes 16th-century linenfold panelling said to come from Catesby Priory, and 17th-century panelling, doorcases and a <b>stair</b> with barley-sugar <b>balusters,</b> all from the previous 17th-century Catesby House that was in Lower Catesby.|$|R
50|$|Internally, the {{building}} has a timber gallery above the entrance accessed by a corner timber <b>stair</b> with turned <b>balusters.</b> The side aisles are separated from the nave by concrete columns surmounted by pointed arches with expressed mouldings. The building has a concrete floor, and the nave has a scissor braced King-post roof with curved side braces and lined with diagonal boarding.|$|R
5|$|Internally, {{a number}} of rooms feature period wall and ceiling decorations {{including}} the entrance hall, which dates from the original 1730s building and features moulded panelling and cornices, a marble fireplace and ornamental plaster ceiling and an arabesque frieze.

50|$|In 1863 the Catesby House was {{demolished}} {{and a new}} one {{was built}} above lower Catesby, about half-way {{up the hill to}} Upper Catesby. The new Catesby House is Jacobethan and incorporates items from previous buildings at Lower Catesby: 16th-century linenfold panelling said to come from the priory, and 17th-century panelling, doorcases and a <b>stair</b> with barley-sugar <b>balusters,</b> all from the old Catesby House.|$|R
50|$|Internally, {{a number}} of rooms feature period wall and ceiling decorations {{including}} the entrance hall, which dates from the original 1730s building and features moulded panelling and cornices, a marble fireplace and ornamental plaster ceiling and an arabesque frieze. The stairwell is lit from above with a roof light and features a cantilevered <b>stair</b> with iron <b>balusters</b> from the 1825 adaptation with a later brass handrail.|$|R
25|$|Visitors would ascend the stairs, {{walk through}} the portal in the Portico and arrive in a {{vestibule}} which extended vertically for two storeys and was lit by a skylight in a coffered, oval domed ceiling. At night time the space was illuminated with gas lights with movable shades. The two flights of marble stairs united at a landing over which was a half dome. From there the stairs extended to running {{on both sides of}} the upper floor. The <b>stair's</b> <b>balusters</b> were of biscuit porcelain. The reception room to the left of the vestibule, extended the length of all five windows of the south wing and led to the ballroom, an octagonal room with four rounded niches in the corners. A skylight illuminated the windowless room with a similar gas lamp as the vestibule, providing nighttime lighting. The panelled north wall could be folded down into the adjoining lightwell such that it spanned the well. Again with a glass roof, the additional space was used to provide accommodation for musicians or other performers. The connecting drawing room linked the ballroom via a further anteroom, the former conservatory, with the great hall. This opulent room was built after the British bought the embassy. They employed August Orth to convert the old garden terrace on the west side of the building into a sumptuous state room. Paired marble corinthian pilasters and columns lined the walls and punctuated the glazing to the central courtyard and vaults rose over an entablature to support a flat ceiling decorated with rich ornamental carvings and painting. In 1877 the Berlin sculptor Otto Lessing created two stucco reliefs featuring dancing Maenads as part of the wall decoration for the great hall. Once again the lighting was provided by gas lamps with mobile shades integrated into the oval skylight, which simultaneously allowed ventilation.|$|R
50|$|The {{stairwell}} {{occupies the}} tower that terminates {{in the roof}} top belvedere. A primarily timber structure, the <b>stair</b> has ornamental <b>balusters,</b> carved stringers and marble treads and risers on the flights between ground and first floor. Painted cast iron panels are incorporated into the stair balustrade. Beyond the first floor the stair treads and risers are timber. A narrower stair connects the second floor to {{a room at the}} top of the tower under the belvedere.|$|R
50|$|The {{entrance}} vestibule has a pressed metal ceiling, {{and leads to}} the former telephone lobby which features tessellated floor tiles and a leadlight window. Through a further triplet of moulded plaster archways with keystones, capitals and balusters, is the main stair hall. The <b>stair</b> has squared <b>balusters</b> and newels, and a panelled spandrel below. Adjoining is the public bar whose layout has been altered, but it retains its pressed metal ceiling with roses, cornices borders and beam linings.|$|R
50|$|Later extensions, {{especially}} in the 1870s, retain something of the original character, if not the scale, in the plethora of traceried bargeboards, dormers, and barley-sugar chimneystacks. The detailing of the north-west front is more overtly Baronial, having a central tower-like pavilion with chamfered corners at the upper levels, a tall pyramidal roof, and a quadrant bartizan at the north-east angle. There are attractive interiors, particularly the <b>stair</b> with twisted <b>balusters</b> and timber arcading. Many fittings were moved here in the 1880s by Dorothea Veitch from Bassendean House.|$|R
50|$|The two-story {{building}} {{sits on a}} 60 by 33 ft base. All facades {{are made}} of locally quarried gray limestone. The since-modified original first floor plan of a center hall dividing a large room on one side from two smaller ones on the other is still evident in the basement layout, with the original winter kitchen in the southwest corner. The second story is given over to bedrooms and storage space. The fine wide <b>stair,</b> with gumwood <b>balusters</b> and rails gives ascent to the attic, used also for storage.|$|R
50|$|The stair and {{entrance}} hall, {{access to}} which is provided through the entrance {{at the southern}} end of the Quay Street facade, is a long room extending the breadth of the building and divided by a round arched opening with moulded architrave and imposts and with a prominent keystone. The archway separates the principal stair from the entrance area. This is a dog-legged timber <b>stair</b> with turned <b>balusters</b> and turned newels at the landings and at the base and top. A vertical sash window opening is fitted with simple leadlights.|$|R
50|$|Internally, {{the former}} {{residence}} is accessed via {{a set of}} timber stairs in the south eastern corner of the building. The <b>stairs</b> have turned <b>balusters</b> and substantial newel posts with chamfered rectangular tops. On the first floor, the former residence partition walls have been removed, however the remaining large space retains its timber lined ceilings, a single fretwork ceiling ventilator panel, a former kitchen fireplace, and a fireplace in the south eastern corner with fine timber panelling and ceramic tiled surrounds. Some of the decorative ironmongery remains, including wall ventilator panels, escutcheon plates, and a teardrop-shaped door handle at the ground floor entrance.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper floor}} of the Station Building {{contains}} currently disused offices, while the ground floor contains station operations rooms, offices and store areas. Timber <b>stairs</b> with cast-iron <b>balusters</b> are located on the western side. The first floor interiors retain some vertically-jointed timber-lined walls and a small timber service window. The ground floor interiors retain some masonry arches and timber columns with decorative timber capitals. The annex to the southern end contains store-rooms and toilets, including a Ladies Waiting Room of generous proportions. A small timber-lined kiosk (1936) with timber roll-down louvred shutters opening out onto the platform {{is located at the}} northern end.|$|R
5000|$|Don Lorenzo del Rosario House is a three-storey mixed-used {{structure}} used {{as commercial}} and residential space. It has been called Casa Bizantina because of its Byzantine ornamentation such as a half-moon opening above the large entrance with grill works, arches above {{the windows of the}} third floor, engaged columns, and appliqued carvings. However, the house reflects more of the Neo-Mudejar or Spanish-Moorish architectural style. A balcony, or mirador, crowned the roof above the interior's <b>stairs</b> with turned <b>balusters.</b> The <b>stairs</b> leads up to the second and third floors and provides access to both wings of the house.|$|R
50|$|Internally, {{the ground}} floor has an {{entrance}} hall and stair on the southern side, with a dining room fronting Quay Street on the northern side, and a bar, sitting area and kitchen at the rear fronting a courtyard. A masonry cross wall separates {{the front and rear}} areas, with access provided by two arches with pilasters flanking a decorative wall niche. The original strongroom is located centrally on the northern side, and is used as a store. Ceilings are finished with compressed sheeting, and masonry walls are rendered. The rear bar and sitting area opens via french doors to a courtyard, which is mostly covered by a first floor deck, and which contains toilets, stair and access to the rear store and office building. The entrance hall has a timber <b>stair</b> with turned <b>balusters,</b> newel posts and timber handrails, a boarded timber ceiling, and rear access to the bar area via an office under the stair landing.|$|R
50|$|Internally, {{the ground}} floor of the central area is a large open space {{interspersed}} with columns, apart from a later partitioned office to the south side. It features a high ceiling lined with ornate pressed metal including borders, cornices, roses and beam surrounds, but the volume of the space has been interrupted by the addition of a timber mezzanine level and a steel stair. To the south wall of this central space is a substantial flat-arched opening decorated with a moulded architrave, consoles and a cast-iron column of Corinthian order leading to the adjoining south wing. To the southeast corner is a walk-in safe with a large steel safe door. To the eastern wall is a timber <b>stair</b> with turned <b>balusters</b> and newels. Visible from the interior, at the north western corner of the building is a sandstone column and part walls {{at the rear of the}} building, which are believed to be the remnants of a previous building on the site.|$|R
40|$|It {{appears that}} David Jenkins {{constructed}} this substantial farmhouse in Gaston County {{in the third}} quarter of the nineteenth century The house has attributes of the popular antebellum Greek Revival style and details of the Italianate style.

50|$|Adjacent to {{the north}} of the gateway, is a gatekeepers' lodge whose Ann Street facade is a {{continuation}} of the school's retaining wall, the lodge being slightly taller than the adjacent wall. The building is two storeyed, and with the cutting down of Ann Street after the lodge's construction a retaining wall has been added as a base to the Ann Street facade of the building. This facade projects slightly from the face of the retaining wall and is detailed with smooth faced sandstone string coursing in line with the sill of the two storeys of windows. The steeply pitched hipped slate roof is concealed on the Ann Street facade by a parapet, being an entablature, consisting of a cornice with dentils surmounted by an architrave. Two storeys of round headed arched windows are featured on this facade, reflecting the early levels of the building. These windows differ in detail on each storey, the lower having sandstone tracery dividing the opening into two lancet windows with round arched heads and a circular opening between. The upper storey openings are simply round headed arched openings. Window and door openings on the south western wall indicate the previous entrance level of the building. Internally the building has timber floors throughout, plaster and lath walls, timber boarded ceilings, an early quarter-turn timber <b>stair</b> with turned <b>balusters</b> and simple timber architraves and skirting boards.|$|R
500|$|The {{symmetrical}} 15-bay three-storey south front {{overlooking the}} pond {{is the work}} of Leoni. [...] Although Leoni had been influenced by the works and principles of Palladio, both Pevsner and the authors of the citation in the National Heritage List for England agree that the design of this front is more Baroque than Palladian. The bottom storey is rusticated with arched windows, and the other storeys are smooth with rectangular windows. The middle three bays consist of a portico of which the lowest storey has three arches. Above this arise four giant fluted Ionic columns supporting a triangular pediment. Standing on the pediment are three lead statues, of Neptune, Venus and Pan. The pediment partly hides Wyatt's blind balustraded ashlar attic block. The other bays are separated by plain Ionic pilasters and the end three bays on each side protrude slightly. [...] The nine-bay three-storey east front is mostly Elizabethan in style and has Wyatt's single-storey extension protruding from its centre. The courtyard was remodelled by Leoni, who gave it a rusticated cloister on all sides. Above the cloister the architecture differs on the four sides although all the windows on the first (piano nobile) floor have pediments. On the west side is a one-bay centrepiece with a window between two Doric pilasters; on the south and north are three windows with four similar pilasters; and on the east front is the grand entrance with a portal in a Tuscan aedicule. This entrance is {{between the first and second}} storeys and is approached by symmetrical pairs of <b>stairs</b> with iron <b>balusters,</b> which were made in 1734 [...] by John Gardom of Baslow, Derbyshire. [...] In the centre of the courtyard is an Italian Renaissance well-head, surrounded by chequered pink and white stone, simulating marble.|$|R
