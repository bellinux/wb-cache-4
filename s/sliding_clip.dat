50|$|An AUI {{connector}} is a DA-15 (D-subminiature). It has a <b>sliding</b> <b>clip</b> {{in place}} of the thumbscrews normally found on a D-connector to hold two connectors together. This clip permits the MAU and MAC to be directly attached to one another even when their size and shape would preclude the use of thumbscrews. This clip is however frequently found to be awkward and/or unreliable.|$|E
50|$|AUI used a {{full-sized}} 15-pin D connector (model DA-15) {{that used}} a <b>sliding</b> <b>clip</b> for mechanical connections {{in place of}} thumbscrews. AAUI replaced these with a small 14-position, 0.05-inch-spaced ribbon contact connector. The connector may {{have been changed to}} avoid confusion with the monitor port on early Macintoshes, which also used a 15-pin D connector. The connector was locked into position using two clips or hooks {{on the sides of the}} connector outside of the D shell (where screws often are on D subs) which automatically clicked on when plugged in, and could be removed simply by pulling back on a sliding sheath over the body of the connector, disengaging the hooks. Third-party AAUI devices often omitted this sheath, requiring the user to directly squeeze small tabs on the sides of the plug housing to detach the hooks.|$|E

40|$|To provide {{users with}} an {{overview}} of medical video content at various levels of abstraction {{which can be used}} for more efficient database browsing and access, a hierarchical video summarization strategy has been developed and is presented in this paper. To generate an overview, the key frames of a video are preprocessed to extract special frames (black frames, <b>slides,</b> <b>clip</b> art, sketch drawings) and special regions (faces, skin or blood-red areas). A shot grouping method is then applied to merge the spatially or temporally related shots into groups. The visual features and knowledge from the video shots are integrated to assign the groups into predefined semantic categories. Based on the video groups and their semantic categories, video summaries for different levels are constructed by group merging, hierarchical group clustering and semantic category selection. Based on this strategy, a user can select the layer of the summary to access. The higher the layer, the more concise the video summary; the lower the layer, the greater the detail contained in the summary...|$|R

50|$|Jacklines may be rigged {{temporarily}} when {{bad weather}} is expected, or, especially on sailboats heading offshore, {{they may be}} left in place {{all the time and}} used as necessary. They are usually attached to strong padeye or cleat fittings {{at both ends of the}} boat, allowing the crewmember to move fore and aft by <b>sliding</b> their harness <b>clip</b> along the line. Jacklines may be made of wire or low-stretch rope. More recently, sailors are using high strength nylon webbing. The reason is that flat webbing does not roll under foot while working on deck and there is less chance to confuse it with other lines in difficult conditions. This reduces the hazard that can be created by using rope.|$|R

40|$|The knife {{home is a}} {{combination}} of individual kitchen knife blades and handles. The blades and handles are designed to be stored in a small box able to fit in a standard kitchen drawer. The blades will not be exposed, they will be covered up by the storage box, so you never have to touch the actual blade. The handles are constructed with a lever arm making the blades interchangeable. When going to insert a blade, you will <b>slide</b> a <b>clip</b> releasing the lever arm upward, insert the blade into the handle slot, lock the lever arm back into place. When desired to remove the blade you would follow the same steps. When cleaning the blade it will be recommended to separate the two parts for the most efficient method of sanitizing. The purpose of this product is to reduce the everyday dangers of knives around children. Also the compact design allows the user to store/transport their knives. We researched patents to see if there were any other products like ours on the market. We could only find utility knives that had interchangeable blades, in which they were very difficult to remove and replace. We also surveyed approximately 104 people on questions related to our product, safety issues, and the use of kitchen knives...|$|R

This box was placed {{to the left of the}} 2 numeral, opposite to where it was in the previous look, and faded in at the end of the ident. Once again, no clock accompanied the look, and appears to have been abandoned by the BBC. Promotions began with clips of the programme, before the clips were encompassed inside a 2, as it moved back to the endslide, featuring programme name and BBC Two box logo on the left with a full size 2 on the right through which the clips can still be seen. This theme also existed with the breakdown <b>slide,</b> with <b>clips</b> being used from the Seascape ident.

5000|$|In sailing, pintles insert into {{gudgeons}} {{that are}} normally {{affixed to the}} transom of a boat. Normally, the corresponding pintle fitting on the rudder <b>slides,</b> lowers or <b>clips</b> into the gudgeon. There are variations where gudgeons are mounted to the rudder and boat, and a pivot clevis pin is inserted into these gudgeons, or the pintles are fastened to the boat, and gudgeons {{are attached to the}} rudder. In any case, the fitting with the hole is referred to as a gudgeon. They are used to attach the rudder to the boat so that it can swing freely. The rudder can then be turned with the tiller. There must be at least two gudgeon/pintle sets for stability in the rudder's attachment to the transom. The pintles must face the same direction for insertion into the gudgeons and usually one is a bit longer so it can be the first into its gudgeon, giving some stability for the insertion of the other pintle. To prevent the rudder from rising out of the gudgeons there is often some preventer such as rudder weight or a locking device slid across the path of the pintle's removal from the upper gudgeon (also referred to as a Rudder Stop).Really good installations (gudgeons) have bushings, (plain bearing) either a solid sleeve, flanged or clenched. This will allow for smoother operation of the helm and preserve the pintles and gudgeons. A bushing can be seen as [...] "consumable".|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: An {{isolated}} transgastric port {{has some}} limitations in performing transluminal endoscopic cholecystectomy. However, transvesical {{access to the}} peritoneal cavity has recently {{been reported to be}} feasible and safe. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and the technical benefits of transgastric and transvesical combined approach to overcome the limitations of isolated transgastric ports. DESIGN: We created a transgastric and transvesical combined approach to perform cholecystectomy in 7 consecutive anesthetized female pigs. The transgastric access was achieved after perforation and dilation of the gastric wall with a needle knife and with a balloon, respectively. Under cystoscopic control, an ureteral catheter, a guidewire, and a dilator of the ureteral sheath were used to place a transvesical 5 -mm overtube into the peritoneal cavity. By using a gastroscope positioned transgastrically and a ureteroscope positioned transvesically, we carried out cholecystectomy in all animals. RESULTS: Establishment of transvesical and transgastric accesses took place without complications. Under a carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum controlled by the transvesical port, gallbladder identification, cystic duct, and artery exposure were easily achieved in all cases. Transvesical gallbladder grasping and manipulation proved to be particularly valuable to enhance gastroscope-guided dissection. With the exclusion of 2 cases where mild liver-surface hemorrhage and bile leak secondary to the <b>sliding</b> of cystic <b>clips</b> occurred, all remaining cholecystectomies were carried out without incidents. LIMITATIONS: Once closure of the gastric hole proved to be unreliable when using endoclips, the animals were euthanized; necropsy was performed immediately after the surgical procedure. CONCLUSIONS: A transgastric and transvesical combined approach is feasible, and it was particularly useful to perform a cholecystectomy through exclusive natural orifices...|$|R

40|$|I will be {{presenting}} {{and expanding}} on my final paper, a film comparison, in French cinema from winter {{quarter of this}} year. When a Hollywood director remakes a foreign film, one may expect an experience that is a distant cousin, rather than a close twin, to its original. Loose ends in the narrative are tied up, moral ambiguity is reworked to depict a clear right and wrong, and patriarchal dominance is bolstered and reaffirmed to preserve the structure of American society as a whole. I will compare French director Claude Chabrol’s La Femme infidèle (1969) with Adrian Lyne’s Hollywood remake Unfaithful (2002). While Lyne manages to preserve, in part, certain French qualities of the original, {{in the end he}} cannot help but take sides, notably punishing each wrongdoer for his or her moral failings; a stance not taken by Chabrol. My presentation will include visuals via PowerPoint <b>slides,</b> stills and <b>clips</b> from the two films, excerpts from my paper, and additional arguments and insights expanded {{for the purposes of this}} talk. I will expound on the qualities characteristic of French film and those unique to Hollywood, examining the work of each director and exploring how they embody the values of their respective markets. Dr. Liahna Armstrong, my instructor in French cinema, has been my mentor throughout this process. I owe the vast broadening of my understanding in cinema studies in no small part to her thought-provoking teachings and the genuine encouragement she lavishes upon the individuals in her care...|$|R

40|$|PhD (Psychology), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Within this study, a psycho-educational {{strategy}} {{was designed to}} promote online safety practices for adolescents living in the northern suburbs of Cape Town. The study made use of a mixed method methodology, including both quantitative and qualitative research. This enabled access to 183 adolescents, as well as gaining more focused and specific insights from adolescent focus groups {{with a total of}} eight focus groups. This psycho-educational {{strategy was}} designed {{in the form of an}} interactive website. The website included information on safety practices pertaining to six areas of online safety. The information was provided in various formats, including videos, <b>clips,</b> <b>slide</b> shows and questionnaires. The six areas which were focused on included cyber bullying, pornography, social networking, online gaming, sharing of personal information and plagiarising and stealing of content. Adolescents were exposed to the website in order to test its usability and its effectiveness as a tool for education regarding online safety. From the literature and findings of the research, it is evident that there is a dire need for age-appropriate and relevant mechanisms to address online safety among adolescents. The present research revealed; through the remarks obtained from focus groups, that adolescents could benefit from the psycho-educational strategy as it created an awareness of the possible harms of the internet; awareness that was previously limited. Specific areas of concern included cyber bullying and the reality that they face regarding this hurtful activity. Adolescents further indicated that they lacked knowledge in areas concerning pornography, plagiarising and sharing of personal information. By creating an awareness regarding possible harms, adolescents are enabled to safeguard themselves from potential harm, and if education is used in future, it can play a preventative role in terms of the negative consequences of online activities. The research indicated that a psycho-educational perspective holds value when addressing online safety. Lastly, the internet as a form of psycho-education was successful as the adolescents accepted and related to this means of education. The psycho-educational strategy is an innovative tool that can be used by schools, parents and educators when engaging with adolescents about online safety. Doctora...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to design, deliver and {{evaluate}} an e-learning teaching programme for post-graduate radiodiagnostics training that would involve various post-graduate schools throughout Italy. Materials and methods: All of the Directors of Italian post-graduate schools of radiodiagnostics were sent an e-mail on 27 September 2010 informing them of our willingness to set up an e-learning project for the academic year 2010 - 2011 in the form of single-subject teaching seminars. The proposed subjects were the semeiotics of the various organs and apparatuses in the context of "Urgent/Emergency Pathology". After having received registrations, a calendar of lessons was planned to be held between 10 November 2010 and 12 October 2011. The validity of the project was tested by means of a multiple-choice questionnaire covering the technical and didactic quality of the entire project, to be completed by the students. Results: Fifty-one percent of the universities in Italy participated in the project: Trieste, Udine, Verona, Milan-Bicocca, Novara, Varese, Genoa, Sassari, Rome Campus, the Catholic University of Rome, Chieti, Foggia, Catania, Modena, Florence, Palermo, Bologna, Pavia, Parma and Ferrara. The lessons were attended by a total of 10, 261 post-graduate medical students, for an average of 513. 1 students per lesson. Seventy percent of the students judged the didactic content " excellent", 25 % "good", and 5 % "satisfactory"; none said it was unsatisfactory. In terms of visual quality (particularly the details of the radiological images proposed in the form of <b>slides</b> and/or video <b>clips),</b> 73 % judged it "excellent", 20 % "good", 6 % "satisfactory", and 1 % "poor". The audio quality was judged "excellent" by 71 %, "good" by 22 %, "satisfactory" by 6 % and "poor" by 1 %. In relation to judgement of audio and video quality, it has to be underlined that this was greatly affected by the hardware/software configuration and the band speed and technology of the Internet connection. Conclusions: Technological evolution is overcoming all barriers, and technology is also having a positive impact on the approach to teaching. Our multicentre teaching experience merits the following considerations: the quality of the teaching product was certified by the students' judgements of its didactic content and the quality of reception; the economic cost of the teaching had a minimal impact on the post-graduate schools (18 per lesson). In terms of breaking down national barriers, it is to be hoped that the coordination and integration of diagnostic imaging e-learning projects, with the participation of post-graduate schools in different European countries, can be developed not only in a spirit of "cultural sharing" and the exchange of teaching experience...|$|R
