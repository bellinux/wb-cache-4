5|$|Hodgsen sold to Carling O'Keefe in 1979, who {{had been}} {{minority}} owners since 1976. The brewing company's total investment in the team was $5.8 million. At {{the time it was}} rapidly ramping up its sports sponsorship (it also owned the Quebec Nordiques before they moved from the World Hockey Association to the NHL) and would become a huge benefactor to the CFL itself, inking television rights deals that would reach $11 million annually by 1984. Reports at the time suggest the league became <b>spoiled</b> <b>by</b> the partnership and that when the money dried up in 1987, the transition was difficult. For the Argos, the Carling O'Keefe years were marked by their first modern-era Grey Cup in 1983.|$|E
5|$|John Stainer was {{the eighth}} of nine {{children}} born to William Stainer and his wife Ann (née Collier) on 6 June 1840. At least three of the children died in infancy, and John was much younger than his brother, William, and his three sisters, Ann, Sarah and Mary. The family lived in Southwark, London, where {{his father was a}} cabinet maker and later a vestry clerk and registrar of births. He was also an untaught musician and player of the piano, violin and flute. He built a small chamber organ at home on which the precocious John used to accompany him when he played hymn tunes on the violin. His sister Ann also used it – she was the regular organist at Magdalen Hospital, Streatham. It was a happy family, and young John seems to have been <b>spoiled</b> <b>by</b> his elders. He was precocious and could play Bach's Fugue in E major at the age of seven.|$|E
5|$|Captain Fernão Pires de Andrade (also spelled as Fernão Peres de Andrade; in {{contemporary}} sources, Fernam (Fernã) Perez Dandrade) (died 1552) was a Portuguese merchant, pharmacist, and official diplomat under the explorer and Portuguese Malacca governor Afonso de Albuquerque. His encounter with Ming China in 1517—after initial contacts by Jorge Álvares and Rafael Perestrello in 1513 and 1516, respectively—marked {{the resumption of}} direct European commercial and diplomatic contact with China. (Even though there were Europeans in Medieval China, notably Marco Polo, that period of contact had been interrupted {{by the fall of}} the Yuan dynasty.) Although de Andrade's mission was initially a success that allowed a Portuguese embassy to proceed all the way to Beijing, relations were soon <b>spoiled</b> <b>by</b> culminating events that led to an extremely negative impression of the Portuguese in China. This included acts of his brother Simão that enraged the Chinese, false reports of the Portuguese being cannibals of kidnapped Chinese children and true reports of their conquest of Malacca, a loyal Ming tributary state. Normalized trade and relations between Portugal and the Ming dynasty would not resume until the late 1540s and the 1557 establishment of Portuguese rule over Macau.|$|E

At the 1986 World Cup in Mexico, West Germany finished as runners-up for the second consecutive tournament after beating France 2–0 in the semi-finals, but losing to the Diego Maradona-led Argentina in the final, 2–3. In Euro 1988, West Germany's hopes of winning the tournament on home soil were <b>spoiled</b> <b>by</b> the Netherlands, as the Dutch beat them 2–1 in the semifinals.|$|E

25|$|The Suns {{acquired}} Penny Hardaway {{from the}} Orlando Magic {{before the start}} of the 1999–00 season in hope of creating the best backcourt duo in the league. Combination of Kidd and Hardaway in the starting lineup was often labeled as the BackCourt 2000. Despite a decent 53–29 record, the Suns' season was <b>spoiled</b> <b>by</b> injuries to both of their superstars. Kidd, who broke his ankle late in the regular season, returned during the playoffs to help his team to beat the defending champion San Antonio Spurs and advance to the second round for the first time in his career.|$|E

25|$|The {{spring of}} 1870 saw Fort Edmonton {{come under the}} threat of {{violence}} due to a war between the Blackfoot and Cree, resulting from the slaying of Cree Chief Maskipiton. The Blackfoot were unable to ford the North Saskatchewan due to the high spring waters, but they encamped across from Fort Edmonton and harassed it with their muskets nonetheless. Some wagons full of goods had to be abandoned by traders in a hurry to reach safety inside of the fort, and their contents were <b>spoiled</b> <b>by</b> the Blackfoot. Though the fort itself was not invaded, the men within were armed and ready to fight. Chief Factor William J. Christie chose to withstand the Blackfoot and not attack them, fearing that to do so would only invite further violence against the Hudson's Bay Company.|$|E

He {{was the only}} boy among the six {{surviving}} children of André-Charles Caron, a watchmaker from Meaux. The family had previously been Huguenots, but had converted to Roman Catholicism {{in the wake of}} the revocation of the Edict of Nantes and the increased persecution of Protestants that followed. The family was comfortably middle-class and Beaumarchais had a peaceful and happy childhood. As the only son, he was <b>spoiled</b> <b>by</b> his parents and sisters. He took an interest in music and played several instruments. Though born a Catholic, Beaumarchais retained a sympathy for Protestants and would campaign throughout his life for their civil rights. One of his sisters, Marie-Josèphe Caron, later became an artist; their cousin was the artist Suzanne Caron.|$|E

However, the excellent rookie's performance was <b>spoiled</b> <b>by</b> the event in the semi-finals against the Soviet Union. Forty-five seconds before the end, Yugoslavia had a comfortable lead of 9 points, but the Soviets scored two three-pointers within a few seconds and cut the difference to 3 points. Yugoslavia tried to hold the ball for the remaining time, opting to continue the play with throw-ins instead of free throws following fouls, but with only 14 seconds left, Divac committed a double dribble, the Soviets were awarded the ball, and tied the score with another three-pointer.
