In this work, we focus on improving the QoS user experience (QoE) of Internet <b>subscribers</b> <b>connecting</b> to heavily loaded servers. Firstly, we advocate an innovative architecture for fine-grained admission-control of Internet servers subjected to multiple flow-based sessions. The proposed architecture is based on original concepts which meet the constraints of multiple-flow based sessions by explicitly identifying the flows pertaining to a single subscriber's session. Secondly, based on an economically-justified service model, we investigate novel session-aware admission-control for improving providers' profitability. Our fundamental observation {{is that it is}} sometimes desirable to reject some customers' new sessions so that others may be completed and thereby generate some revenue for the service provider. We evaluate the performance of the advocated model by conducting advanced simulations where we consider realistic CBR voice traffic. Results demonstrate that responsive session-aware admission-control improves service provider's benefits. For a satisfactory operator's revenue, session-aware admission-control improves the success rate by more than 69 %, compared to standard request-aware admission-control...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For Internet service {{providers}} (ISPs) the proper dimensioning of Internet access lines is essential. Under-dimensioning generally {{leads to a}} less than acceptable end-to-end Quality of Service (QoS) perceived by the subscribers, and over-dimensioning is generally too expensive. In this paper, we demonstrate empirically that the Generalised Processor Sharing (GPS) model {{can be used to}} accurately describe the flow-level characteristics of the traffic carried by Internet access lines, based on analysis of IP packet-level traces with hundreds of <b>subscribers</b> <b>connected</b> to the Internet over high-speed access lines. Using properties of the GPS-model, we establish simple relations between the access line capacity and the utilisation of the access lines {{on the one hand and}} the download times of Internet objects on the other hand. Subsequently, we study the impact of the TCP slow start algorithm on the download times of objects. We propose simple and fast approximations for the average object download time as a function of the object size, encompassing the effect of the round-trip times, maximum window size and modem speed. Empirical data demonstrate the accuracy of the approximations. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to model the traffic {{generated}} in a FTTX network for voice and data transmission. Thus, we commence with a traffic model that represents the use that network subscribers make of the system, allowing the generation of requests sent by the <b>subscribers</b> <b>connected</b> to the return channels. The model uses the number of subscribers assigned to each return channel. The traffic in each return channel is obtained from the aggregation of the separated traffic streams originated by the user’s applications executed. Later, a model of the branches from the cable network is developed, considering both the upstream channels and the downstream channel of the controller. The results obtained in these processes can be validated using the real data provided by a FTTX cable operator. For the accomplishment of the model, the OPNET simulation language has been used. In addition, the results have been exported to MATLAB, which permits the execution of all types of statistical analyses, with the aim of both making the verification of the results and the validation of the developed model...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: In {{study the}} impact of the optical {{technologies}} and infrastructures on the reduction of the carbon footprint maintaining high level of broadband to the end user is discussed. Approach: Authors analyze the main energy consumers in Core, Metro and Access Networks as well as the topology and the performaces of the EU FP 7 SARDANA Project, a long reach full optical metro access convergent network. This permit to have a clear and innovative view on the topic of the green networks comparing commercial and on the edge solutions for the critical access segment. Three scenarios have been assumed with different uplink bandwidths: unlimited uplink in the CO, limited uplink of 400 Gbit sec - 1 and strong limitation of 100 Gbit sec - 1. Additionally, three different sizes of the access network with 100, 1, 000 and 10, 000 <b>subscribers</b> <b>connected</b> to a single CO have been considered. Results: Increasing the number of users and reducing the uplink bandwidth, the difference in energy efficiency between TDM and PONs and P-t-P FTTH networks increases.
