5|$|The game {{begins with}} the land of Hyrule in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> because of strange happenings that have {{occurred}} recently. On a stormy night, Princess Zelda and the shrine maidens fear {{that the reason for}} these events is that Vaati's seal is weakening. She summons Link and brings him to the castle so he can protect her and the other maidens while they open the portal to the Four Sword Sanctuary. When they do, however, a shadowy figure appears, Shadow Link, who then kidnaps the maidens of the Shrines and seals them inside their crystals. Link follows him to the mysterious sanctuary where the Four Sword lies in the Pedestal, keeping the great evil sealed away. Link pulls the Four Sword out of its Pedestal, splitting into three clones of himself to destroy this doppelganger. However, The Seal that imprisoned the Sorcerer of Winds, Vaati, was broken and had released him from his Prison once again, wreaking havoc on the once peaceful kingdom of Hyrule and bringing chaos and horror.|$|E
25|$|Some of Crichton's fiction used a {{literary}} technique called false document. For example, Eaters of the Dead is a fabricated recreation of the Old English epic Beowulf {{in the form}} of a scholarly translation of Ahmad ibn Fadlan's 10th-century manuscript. Other novels, such as The Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park, incorporated fictionalized scientific documents {{in the form of}} diagrams, computer output, DNA sequences, footnotes and bibliography. Some of his novels, such as The Terminal Man and <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fear,</b> included authentic published scientific works to illustrate his point.|$|E

25|$|When {{the trial}} ended, Sebold disappeared. He entered a {{government}} {{witness protection program}} and moved to California under another assumed identity. He had countless jobs, even {{trying to be a}} chicken farmer, but could never hold down a job and was constantly plagued by bad health. Additionally, letters from his family back in Germany explained that the Nazis still wanted to exact their revenge, leaving him in a constant <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear.</b> Sebold was diagnosed with manic depression and committed to Napa State Hospital in 1965. Five years later he suffered a heart attack and died.|$|E
25|$|Captain Charles Brown, {{in command}} of the settlers, was ordered to march down the coast until he reached the rear of the Māori {{positions}} at Waireka. The Regulars, under Lieut-Colonel G.F. Murray, marched down the main road to Omata, intending to dislodge a war party reported to be at Whalers Gate, north of Omata. Once the road was clear, it was intended they would be joined by the Volunteers and militia, who would rescue the settlers, before marching back to New Plymouth. Because of the heightened <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> in New Plymouth, however, Murray had been ordered to return his troops to the town before nightfall. The Volunteers were armed with muzzle-loading Enfield rifles and the militia had old smooth-bore muskets from the 1840s, with each man issued with just 30 rounds of ammunition.|$|E
500|$|Kubah is {{an early}} example of {{literature}} dealing with the G30S and PKI, although earlier examples exist. Former Indonesian president Abdurrahman Wahid described it as the first to deal with reconciliation between PKI members and general Indonesian society after G30S, an issue which was [...] "hyper-sensitive" [...] at the time. The historian Anna-Greta Nilsson Hoadley writes that Kubah explored why a person would be motivated to join the party, emphasizing poverty, cultural pressure, and active propaganda by the PKI. In the end, Karman is ultimately an [...] "innocent victim", who only joined the Party to improve his own standing. Even after his release Karman remains in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear,</b> [...] "marked by a prisoner's vulnerability." [...] The literary critics Maman S. Mahayana, Oyon Sofyan, and Achmad Dian wrote that, in this sense, Karman becomes representative of all PKI members who were arrested following G30S.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that Nora Wall was convicted {{because of the}} atmosphere generated by the <b>States</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> series (see <b>States</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> subsection below). It is also accepted - not least by Mary Raftery herself - that [...] "Dear Daughter" [...] was an important predecessor to <b>States</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fear.</b> In the book Suffer the Little Children published in November 1999 as a follow up to her TV series, Mary Raftery and her co-author Eoin O'Sullivan wrote: Dear Daughter concerned the experiences at Goldenbridge Industrial School, Dublin of Christine Buckley, who grew up there during the 1950s. She had suffered horrific abuse, and descriptions were also given of the systematic ill-treatment of other children by the Sisters of Mercy, who ran the school. These included memories of children being routinely and savagely beaten, having boiling water poured over them, being locked in a furnace room, being forced to stand all night in a corridor as punishment, and very young children being made to sit on potties so long {{that in some cases}} their rectums collapsed.|$|R

50|$|The {{focus on}} the <b>States</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> {{programmes}} may explain why - apart from news reports on trial days - RTÉ's coverage of the scandal was confined to a 30-minute programme in the Would You Believe series on 11 January 2000.|$|R

2500|$|In 2004, Crichton {{published}} <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fear,</b> a novel concerning eco-terrorists {{who attempt}} mass murder {{to support their}} views. Global warming serves as a central theme to the novel, although a review in Nature found it [...] "likely to mislead the unwary". The novel had an initial print run of 1.5million copies and reached the No. 1 bestseller position at Amazon.com and No. 2 on The New York Times Best Seller list for one week in January 2005.|$|E
2500|$|The Great Purge has {{provoked}} numerous debates about its purpose, scale and mechanisms. According to one interpretation, Stalin’s regime had {{to maintain its}} citizens in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> and uncertainty {{to stay in power}} (Brzezinski, 1958). Robert Conquest emphasized Stalin's paranoia, focused on the Moscow show trial of [...] "Old Bolsheviks", and analyzed the carefully planned and systematic destruction of the Communist Party. Some others view the Great Purge as a crucial moment – or rather the culmination – of a vast social engineering campaign started {{at the beginning of the}} 1930s (Hagenloh, 2000; Shearer, 2003; Werth, 2003).|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Crichton {{clashed with}} {{journalist}} Michael Crowley, {{a senior editor}} of the magazine The New Republic. In March 2006, Crowley wrote a strongly critical review of <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fear,</b> focusing on Crichton's stance on global warming. In the same year, Crichton published the novel Next, which contains a minor character named [...] "Mick Crowley", who is a Yale graduate and a Washington, D.C.-based political columnist. The character was portrayed as a child molester with a small penis. The character does not appear elsewhere in the book. The real Crowley, also a Yale graduate, alleged that by including a similarly named character Crichton had libeled him.|$|E

5000|$|Nora Wall and Pablo McCabe were {{originally}} accused in 1996 {{shortly after the}} broadcast by RTÉ of the TV documentary [...] "Dear Daughter" [...] in February of that year; they were convicted in June 1999 one month after RTÉ's broadcast <b>of</b> the <b>States</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> series produced by Mary Raftery.|$|R
50|$|In 1996 Dear Daughter, a {{documentary}} looking at abuse allegations at St. Vincent's Industrial School, Goldenbridge, Ireland, which {{was run by}} the Sisters of Mercy, was screened on RTÉ Television. The documentary focused on allegations against a nun at the school by a former resident. Although serious concerns were raised {{about the validity of}} a key aspect of the testimony, and the allegations were denied by the nun concerned, the documentary led to further accounts of abuse at the school. A second documentary series, <b>States</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fear,</b> screened in 1999. <b>States</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> looked at allegations of abuse in the Irish industrial school system, prompting a strong public response, and this {{led to the formation of}} the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse which examined abuse allegations against a number of Roman Catholic organisations in Ireland, including the Sisters of Mercy.|$|R
2500|$|Willet Gashade (Oates), {{a former}} bounty hunter, {{returns to his}} small mining camp after a lengthy absence and finds his slow-witted friend Coley (Will Hutchins) in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear.</b> Coley {{explains}} to Gashade that their partner, Leland Drum (B. J. Merholz), had been shot to death two days before by an unseen assassin. The killing was possibly committed in revenge for the accidental trampling death of [...] "a little person" [...] in town, {{which may have been}} caused by Gashade's brother, Coin. Coin had inexplicably rushed away from their camp moments before the shooting death. Gashade and Coley become increasingly paranoid, and Gashade takes his friend's gun away from him.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2011 [...] "Fear Itself" [...] storyline, Sin frees Odin's long-forgotten brother, Cul, a God of Fear known also as the Serpent, {{from his}} {{underwater}} prison.

At Thor's funeral, Thor and other people's memories of him are replaced by Ulik {{under the guise of}} Tanarus, a new thunder god. Thor returns from the limbo of forgotten dead gods with the help of Loki and the Silver Surfer, and vanquishes Ulik.|$|E
2500|$|His {{literary}} works are usually within the action genre and heavily feature technology. His novels epitomize the techno-thriller genre of literature, often exploring technology and failures of human interaction with it, especially resulting in catastrophes with biotechnology. Many of his future history novels have medical or scientific underpinnings, reflecting his medical training and science background. He wrote, among other works, The Andromeda Strain (1969); Congo (1980); Sphere (1987); Travels (1988); Jurassic Park (1990); Rising Sun (1992); Disclosure (1994); The Lost World (1995); Airframe (1996); Timeline (1999); Prey (2002); <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> (2004); Next (2006), the final book published before his death; Pirate Latitudes (2009), an action adventure novel concerning 17th-century piracy in the Caribbean; Micro, an unfinished techno-thriller {{which was published}} in November 2011; and Dragon Teeth, a historical novel set during the [...] "Bone Wars", published in May 2017.|$|E
5000|$|Carol Coulter, {{legal affairs}} {{correspondent}} for the Irish Times wrote on 1 December 2005 that [...] "case took place {{at a time of}} heightened sensitivity to the problem of the sexual abuse of children in institutions, especially those run by religious orders. The RTÉ series <b>States</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> had ended a month earlier, generating widespread debate and indignation." [...] An Irish Times editorial on 17 December 2005 entitled [...] "Nora Wall" [...] stated that: The charges were laid at a time when allegations of the abuse of children in institutions had entered the public domain. The case was heard within a month of the broadcast by RTÉ <b>of</b> the <b>States</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> programmes. The jury could not but have been affected, it seems, by the horrific abuse exposed in that series and by the complaints of the child victims that no-one listened to them.|$|R
50|$|Sexual desire {{has been}} {{described}} as a “longing for sexual union”, it associates with certain behaviours that are more linked to arousal and <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear,</b> concern and enhanced attention to others, and sexual cue displays such as lip biting and touching. In keeping with the correlation between sexual desire and arousal, sexual desire is mediated by gonadal estrogens and androgens.|$|R
50|$|Wall told {{teacher and}} {{religious}} affairs journalist Breda O'Brien {{that she has}} {{no doubt that the}} atmosphere generated by <b>States</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> was a central factor in the jury's willingness to believe the allegations.

2500|$|Sañjīva, the [...] "reviving" [...] Naraka, has ground made of hot iron heated by {{an immense}} fire. Beings in this Naraka appear fully grown, {{already in a}} <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> and misery. As soon as the being begins to fear being harmed by others, their fellows appear and attack each other with iron claws and hell guards appear and attack the being with fiery weapons. As soon as the being {{experiences}} an unconsciousness like death, they are suddenly restored to full health and the attacks begin again. Other tortures experienced in this Naraka include: having molten metal dropped upon them, being sliced into pieces, and suffering from {{the heat of the}} iron ground. Life in this Naraka is 1.621012 years long. It is said to be 1,000 yojanas beneath Jambudvīpa and 10,000 yojanas in each direction (a yojana being 7 miles, or 11 kilometres).|$|E
2500|$|This {{controversy}} {{began with}} the misinterpretation {{of the results of}} a 2002 paper by Doran et al., which found [...] "Although previous reports suggest slight recent continental warming, our spatial analysis of Antarctic meteorological data demonstrates a net cooling on the Antarctic continent between 1966 and 2000, particularly during summer and autumn." [...] Later the controversy was popularized by Michael Crichton's 2004 fiction novel <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fear,</b> who advocated skepticism in global warming. This novel has a docudrama plot based upon {{the idea that there is}} a deliberately alarmist conspiracy behind global warming activism. One of the characters argues [...] "data show that one relatively small area called the Antarctic Peninsula is melting and calving huge icebergs... but the continent as a whole is getting colder, and the ice is getting thicker." [...] As a basis for this plot twist, Crichton cited the peer reviewed scientific article by Doran, et al. Peter Doran, the lead author of the paper cited by Crichton, stated [...] "...our results have been misused as 'evidence' against global warming by Crichton in his novel 'State of Fear'...'Our study did find that 58 percent of Antarctica cooled from 1966 to 2000. But during that period, the rest of the continent was warming. And climate models created since our paper was published have suggested a link between the lack of significant warming in Antarctica and the ozone hole over that continent." ...|$|E
