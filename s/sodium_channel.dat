5|$|Genetic {{mutations}} in the L-type calcium channel Î±1-subunit (Cav1.1) {{have been described}} in Southern Chinese with TPP. The mutations are located in {{a different part of}} the gene from those described in the related condition familial periodic paralysis. In TPP, the mutations described are single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the hormone response element responsive to thyroid hormone, implying that transcription of the gene and production of ion channels may be altered by increased thyroid hormone levels. Furthermore, mutations have been reported in the genes coding for potassium voltage-gated channel, Shaw-related subfamily, member 4 (Kv3.4) and <b>sodium</b> <b>channel</b> protein type 4 subunit alpha (Na41.4).|$|E
5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may interfere with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, <b>sodium</b> <b>channel</b> blockers), interfere with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or interfere with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E
25|$|NEDD4 can bind and ubiquitinate the {{epithelial}} <b>sodium</b> <b>channel</b> (ENaC), {{leading to}} down-regulation of <b>sodium</b> <b>channel</b> activity. However, in vivo studies have implicated the NEDD4 family member NEDD4-2 {{as the main}} ligase responsible for ENaC regulation.|$|E
50|$|Mu-conotoxins {{have two}} types of {{cysteine}} arrangements, but the knottin scaffold is not observed. Mu-conotoxins target the muscle-specific voltage-gated <b>sodium</b> <b>channels,</b> and are useful probes for investigating voltage-dependent <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> of excitable tissues. Mu-conotoxins target the voltage-gated <b>sodium</b> <b>channels,</b> preferentially those of skeletal muscle, and are useful probes for investigating voltage-dependent <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> of excitable tissues.|$|R

30|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>channels</b> {{predominantly}} {{expressed in}} brain {{are expressed in}} myocardial tissue and {{play an important role}} in cardiac physiology. Alterations of <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> are known to result in neurological disease in infancy and childhood. It will be of interest to study the expression of brain-type <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> in the developing myocardium.|$|R

25|$|The {{antiarrhythmic}} drug lidocaine {{has been}} reported to be an effective treatment of aconitine poisoning of a patient. Considering the fact that aconitine acts as an agonist of the <b>sodium</b> <b>channel</b> receptor, antiarrhythmic agents which block the <b>sodium</b> <b>channel</b> (Vaughan-Williams' classification I) might be the first choice for the therapy of aconitine induced arrhythmias.|$|E

40|$|Voltage-gated <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> {{are largely}} {{localized}} to the nodes of Ranvier in myelinated axons, providing a physiological basis for saltatory conduction. What happens to these channels in demyelinated axons {{is not known}} with certainty. Experimentally demyelinated axons were examined by using a well-characterized, polyclonal antibody directed against <b>sodium</b> <b>channels.</b> Immunocytochemical and radioimmunoassay data {{were consistent with the}} distribution of an increased number of <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> along segments of previously internodal axon. These findings affirm the plasticity of <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> in demyelinated axolemma and may be relevant to understanding how axons recover conduction after demyelination...|$|R
25|$|Lamotrigine is {{a member}} of the <b>sodium</b> <b>channel</b> {{blocking}} class of antiepileptic drugs.|$|E
25|$|ENaC is {{expressed}} in epithelial cells and {{is different from the}} voltage-gated <b>sodium</b> <b>channel</b> that is involved in the generation of action potentials in neurons. The abbreviation for the genes encoding for voltage-gated <b>sodium</b> <b>channel</b> starts with three letters: SCN. In contrast to these sodium channels, ENaC is constitutively active and is not voltage-dependent. The second N in the abbreviation (SCNN1) represents that these are NON-voltage-gated channels.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to regulating channel gating, <b>sodium</b> <b>channel</b> beta subunits also modulate channel expression and form {{links to the}} intracelluar cytoskeleton via ankyrin and spectrin.|$|E
50|$|Sea anemone toxins act on {{voltage-gated}} <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> (NaV1.1, NaV1.2, NaV1.4, NaV1.5, NaV1.6, NaV1.7) {{and depending}} on their affinity to a specific isoform, they mainly act on cardiac or neuronal voltage-gated <b>sodium</b> <b>channels.</b> Sea anemone toxins act at the receptor site 3. On {{the basis of its}} sequence homology, cangitoxin most likely acts on the same receptor site of the previously mentioned <b>sodium</b> <b>channels.</b> Neurotoxin receptor site 3 is localized on the extracellular side of the IVS4 transmembrane segment. The S4 segments of <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> move outward when the membrane depolarizes.|$|R
40|$|We {{have studied}} the effects of batrachotoxin (BTX) on <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> in hybrid mouse {{neuroblastoma}} cells NG 108 - 15 by using the suction pipet voltage clamp method. BTX-modified <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> activate with first-order kinetics and, {{over most of the}} potential range, activate more slowly than normal <b>sodium</b> <b>channels.</b> The peak conductance-voltage curve and the time constant of activation-versus-voltage curve for BTX-modified <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> are shifted about 50 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction compared to the corresponding curves for normal <b>sodium</b> <b>channels.</b> There is no change in the slope of the conductance-voltage curve. These results suggest that BTX slows down one of the steps leading to channel opening, which consequently becomes rate-limiting. In addition, BTX eliminates both fast and slow inactivation...|$|R
5000|$|Phase 4: Exciting {{triggers}} (e.g. sinus node) {{will cause}} minor depolarization in the cells; {{this will result}} in increasing permeability of <b>sodium</b> <b>channels,</b> which trigger the opening of <b>sodium</b> <b>channels.</b>|$|R
25|$|Some {{novel and}} investigational analgesics include subtype-selective {{voltage-gated}} <b>sodium</b> <b>channel</b> blockers such as funapide and raxatrigine, {{as well as}} multimodal agents such as ralfinamide.|$|E
25|$|NaV1.5 is an {{integral}} membrane protein and tetrodotoxin-resistant voltage-gated <b>sodium</b> <b>channel</b> subunit. NaV1.5 is found primarily in cardiac muscle, where it mediates the fast influx of Na+-ions (INa) across the cell membrane, resulting in the fast depolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. As such, it {{plays a major role}} in impulse propagation through the heart. A vast number of cardiac diseases is associated with mutations in NaV1.5 (see paragraph genetics). SCN5A is the gene that encodes the cardiac <b>sodium</b> <b>channel</b> NaV1.5.|$|E
25|$|Lamotrigine is a phenyltriazine, {{making it}} {{chemically}} distinct from other approved anticonvulsants. It enhances {{the action of}} gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the chief inhibitory neurotransmitter in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS; which consists of the brain and spinal cord). Lamotrigine may also inhibit voltage-gated sodium channels thereby suppressing the release of glutamate and aspartate, two of the dominant excitatory neurotransmitters in the CNS. It is generally accepted {{to be a member of}} the <b>sodium</b> <b>channel</b> blocking class of antiepileptic drugs, but it could have additional actions since it has a broader spectrum of action than other <b>sodium</b> <b>channel</b> antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin and carbamazepine and is effective in the treatment of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder, whereas other <b>sodium</b> <b>channel</b> blocking antiepileptic drugs are not, possibly on account of its sigma receptor activity. In addition, lamotrigine shares few side-effects with other, unrelated anticonvulsants known to inhibit sodium channels, which further emphasises its unique properties. Lamotrigine is inactivated by glucuronidation in the liver.|$|E
30|$|Homology {{models of}} the {{mammalian}} Nav channels have been previously constructed based on the crystal structures of the eukaryotic potassium channels or the prokaryotic <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> (Tikhonov and Zhorov, 2012; Yang et al., 2012). However, the relevance of such models has been in question, since the eukaryotic <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> {{are known to be}} heterotetrameric while the prokaryotic <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> and the potassium channels are of homotetrameric nature.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>channels</b> {{have similar}} {{functional}} properties across many different cell types. While ten human genes encoding for <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> have been identified, their function is typically conserved between species and different cell types.|$|R
50|$|The {{poisonous}} frogs {{themselves are}} perhaps the only creatures to be immune to this poison. Batrachotoxin attacks the <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> of nerve cells, but the frog has special <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> the poison cannot harm.|$|R
25|$|Some of the {{transcribed}} {{genes are}} crucial for transepithelial sodium transport, including the three subunits of the epithelial <b>sodium</b> <b>channel</b> (ENaC), the Na+/K+ pumps and their regulatory proteins serum and glucocorticoid-induced kinase, and channel-inducing factor, respectively.|$|E
25|$|In {{epithelial}} cells with motile cilia lining the bronchus and the oviduct, CFTR {{is located on}} the cell membrane but not on cilia. In contrast, ENaC (Epithelial <b>sodium</b> <b>channel)</b> is located along {{the entire length of the}} cilia.|$|E
25|$|In vitro, NEDD4 {{has been}} shown to bind and ubiquitinate a number of ion {{channels}} and membrane transporters resulting in their subsequent endocytosis and degradation by the proteasome, including the epithelial <b>sodium</b> <b>channel</b> (ENaC), voltage-gated calcium and voltage-gated sodium channels.|$|E
50|$|BcTx1 acts on insect axonal <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> by {{lowering}} their activation threshold (by 5-10 mV), {{resulting in an}} increase of Na+ conductances. It also shifts the steady-state inactivation curve in the negative direction (by ~15 mV). In addition, BcTx1 slows down the activation of <b>sodium</b> <b>channels.</b> As {{a result of its}} action on the <b>sodium</b> <b>channels,</b> neurons depolarize and can no longer fire action potentials, leading to a flaccid paralysis.|$|R
25|$|The {{family of}} <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> has nine known members, with amino acid {{identity}} >50% in the trans-membrane segments and extracellular loop regions. A standardized nomenclature for <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> is currently used and is {{maintained by the}} IUPHAR.|$|R
50|$|Based on its {{homology}} {{to other}} members of the Î±-scorpion toxin family, bukatoxin most likely blocks the inactivation of neuronal <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> by binding to the neurotoxin receptor site 3 of <b>sodium</b> <b>channels,</b> thereby prolonging the action potential.|$|R
25|$|Acidosis such as {{caused by}} {{inflammation}} at a wound partly reduces {{the action of}} LAs. This is partly {{because most of the}} anesthetic is ionized and therefore unable to cross the cell membrane to reach its cytoplasmic-facing site of action on the <b>sodium</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E
25|$|The SCNN1A gene encodes for the Î± subunit of the {{epithelial}} <b>sodium</b> <b>channel</b> ENaC in vertebrates. ENaC is assembled as a heterotrimer {{composed of}} three homologous subunits Î±, Î², and Î³ or Î´, Î², and Î³. The other ENAC subunits are encoded by SCNN1B, SCNN1G, and SCNN1D.|$|E
25|$|NEDD4L {{protein is}} {{expressed}} widely. The primary targets of NEDD4-2 include the epithelial <b>sodium</b> <b>channel</b> (ENaC), the Na+-Cl- co-transporter (NCC), and the voltage gated sodium channels (Navs), although additional targets are predicted from in vitro studies. NEDD4-2 gene in mice {{is essential for}} animal survival and the polymorphisms in NEDD4L are associated with human hypertension.|$|E
50|$|Bactridines are a {{group of}} six {{antibacterial}} peptides from the venom of the Tityus discrepans scorpion. They exclusively target <b>sodium</b> <b>channels.</b> Bactridines are unique in that this scorpion toxin acts on <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> of both bacteria and eukaryotes.|$|R
25|$|The {{anticonvulsant}} {{properties of}} diazepam and other benzodiazepines {{may be in}} part or entirely due to binding to voltage-dependent <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> rather than benzodiazepine receptors. Sustained repetitive firing seems limited by benzodiazepines' effect of slowing recovery of <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> from inactivation.|$|R
25|$|Voltage-gated <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> are {{proteins}} {{found in}} the membrane of neurons. When electrically activated, they allow the movement of sodium ions across a plasma membrane. These channels are responsible for propagation of electrical signals in nerve cells. Voltage-gated <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> {{can be divided into}} two subunits: alpha and beta. A variety of alpha subunit voltage-gated <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> have been identified. Voltage-gated <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> found in mammals can be divided into three types: Nav1.x, Nav2.x, and Nav3.x. Nav1.x <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> are associated with the central nervous system. Nav1.1, Nav2.2, and Nav1.6 are three isoforms of the voltage-gated <b>sodium</b> <b>channels</b> that are present at high levels in the central nervous system of an adult rat brain. These channels have been well documented in the axonal membrane of the central nervous system. Nav1.2 has been primarily identified in unmyelinated axons while high concentrations of Nav1.6 have been observed at nodes of Ranvier of axons. Nav1.6 has been identified in the dendrites of hippocampal CA1 neurons that generate dendritic spikes; the density of Nav1.6 in these neurons is 35-80 times lower than in the initial segments of axons.|$|R
