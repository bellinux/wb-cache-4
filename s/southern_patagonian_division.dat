50|$|According to a 1998 {{negotiation}} held in Buenos Aires, a 50 km {{section of}} the boundary in the <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Ice Field is still pending of mapping and demarcation according to the limits already settled by the 1881 treaty. In 2006 president Néstor Kirchner invited Chile to define the border, but Michelle Bachelet's government left the invitation unanswered. The same year, the Chilean government sent a note to Argentina complaining about Argentine tourism maps that showed a normal boundary in the <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Icefield {{with most of the}} area belonging to Argentina.|$|R
50|$|Although most of {{the lake}} lies in Argentine territory, the western shores of the lake reach the <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Ice Field {{in an area where}} the border remains undefined.|$|R
50|$|Cerro Steffen {{is one of}} {{the highest}} {{mountains}} in the <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Ice Field. It lies on the northeastern edge of the just mentioned icefield, west of O'Higgins Lake.|$|R

50|$|Bernardo Glacier {{is one of}} {{the largest}} glaciers in the <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Ice Field. It is located {{northeast}} of Témpano Glacier, within Bernardo O'Higgins National Park in Chile. The glacier flows westward Bernardo Fjord.|$|R
50|$|Villa O'Higgins is {{connected}} to the rest of Chile by the Carretera Austral (Southern Highway) - the final 120 km of which were completed southwards from Puerto Yungay in 2000 - and is the gateway to the <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Ice Field.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Ice Field {{takes up}} the entire {{western side of the}} park. The <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Ice Field feeds four main glaciers; they are from north to south the glaciers: Dickson, Grey, Zapata, and Tyndall. This last glacier is rapidly receding. The largest is Glacier Grey. It is divided into two arms, because of the {{appearance}} of a peninsula of ice, commonly called the Island or Nunatak, that becomes apparent a little more with each year that passes. The eastern arm measures about 1.2 km while the western has a width around 3.6 km. The longitude of the glacier in its path towards the interior of the park is 15 km.|$|R
50|$|The 250 km2 ice formation, and 30 km in length, {{is one of}} 48 glaciers fed by the <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Ice Field {{located in}} the Andes system shared with Chile. This ice field is the world's third largest reserve of fresh water.|$|R
50|$|In January-February 1931 he, Egidio Feruglio, and {{the alpine}} {{mountain}} guides Croux and Bron, {{were the first}} to fully cross the <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Ice Field; they did it from Lago Viedma (Argentina) to the vicinity of Patagonian channels of the Pacific Ocean (Chile), and back.|$|R
50|$|The Northern Patagonian Icefield {{is one of}} the {{locations}} that experienced a surge in glacial activity during the neoglaciation period. Terminal moraines formed 5.7 thousand years ago in the San Rafael Glacier and around 4.96 thousand years ago they formed in the nearby Colonia glacier. In the <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Icefield located in Argentina and Chile, some glaciers have actually been advancing to their peak extents as recently as the 19th century as evidenced by morraines. Another remnant of glacial activity in the <b>southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> icefield is the creation of meltwater channels within the El Canal spillway found near the Lago del Toro in Chile. The different layers of stratification have been used to date different occurrences of glacial lakes in the region.|$|R
5000|$|Viedma Glacier {{is a large}} glacier {{that is part of}} {{the huge}} <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Ice Field, located at the {{southern}} end of mainland South America. Viedma Glacier is a valley glacier and its moraine-rich terminus flows into the western end of Lake Viedma, which is fed primarily by its melting ice. Viedma Glacier is located in the undefined part of the limit between Chile and Argentina, in argentinian legislature it's in Los Glaciares National Park [...] which was declared a World Heritage Site in 1981. in Chilean legislature part of it is in Bernardo O'Higgins National Park. The <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Ice Field is 13,000 km2; Viedma Glacier is one of the Ice Field's 48 outlet glaciers that have more than 20 km2 of ice field area each.|$|R
50|$|Corresponding to the <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Ice Field, {{located at}} higher altitudes, {{temperatures}} are cold enough to maintain permanent ice fields. Mean temperatures are below 0 C in all months while precipitation (mostly as snow) is abundant year round, receiving 2000 mm. These areas have a polar climate.|$|R
50|$|Argentine irredentism is {{the idea}} of Argentina's {{sovereignty}} over the British Overseas Territories of the Falkland Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, along with the dispute with Chile over the <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Ice Field and disputes with both over the region designated as Argentine Antarctica.|$|R
5000|$|Tortel is Chilean commune {{located at}} the outflow of the Baker River and Pascua River to the Pacific Ocean. It lies between the Northern and <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Ice Field in the Capitán Prat Province in the Aysén Region. The commune is {{administered}} by the municipality in Caleta Tortel, the principal settlement.|$|R
50|$|Jorge Montt Glacier is a tidewater glacier {{located in}} the Aisén Region of Chile, south {{of the town of}} Caleta Tortel. It lies {{at the north end of}} the <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Ice Field, within Bernardo O'Higgins National Park. The mouth of Pascua River is {{located in the}} {{vicinity}} of the glacier calving front.|$|R
50|$|Jorge Quinteros is a Chilean mountaineer {{who has an}} {{extensive}} career as explorer, guide and teacher. Together with Harold William Tilman {{they were the first}} to traverse the <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Ice Field in the summer of 1955-1956. Currently he works in Dirección General de Aguas and teaches at the University of Chile.|$|R
50|$|Wellington Island is {{an island}} west of <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Ice Field, Chile. It has an area of 5,556 km² {{and most of the}} island forms part of Bernardo O'Higgins National Park. It is home to the last Kawésqar people, living in the village of Puerto Edén, the only {{inhabited}} place on the island.|$|R
50|$|While still a Deputy, he {{was also}} elected member of the Assembly that dealt with the 1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution, and he {{played a major role}} in the {{crafting}} of the border treaty between Argentina and Chile of 1998, which dealt with the <b>division</b> of the <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Ice Field.|$|R
50|$|An icefield {{covers a}} {{relatively}} large area, usually located in mountainous terrain. The underlying topography controls or influences the form that an icefield takes. Often, nunataks poke through the surface of icefields. Examples of icefields include the Columbia Icefield in the Canadian Rockies and the Northern and <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Ice Field in Chile and Argentina.|$|R
50|$|The {{east side}} of the fjord has three side fjords, named Amalia, Asia and Calvo. At the head of Amalia Fjord is Amalia Glacier. El Brujo Glacier is found in Asia Fjord, which is another glacier {{spilling}} from the <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Ice Field. Calvo Fjord splits into several arms towards which also descend glaciers.|$|R
50|$|Abrothrix olivaceus markhami, {{also known}} as the Wellington Akodont or Markham's Grass Mouse, is a {{subspecies}} of the South American rodent Abrothrix olivaceus. It occurs on Wellington Island and the nearby <b>Southern</b> <b>Patagonian</b> Ice Field in southern Chile. It was previously recognized as a valid species, but is close to other recognized subspecies of A. olivaceus.|$|R
