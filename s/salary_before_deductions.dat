In 2014 The Daily Mail {{newspaper}} said that an individual would require a <b>salary</b> of £35,000 <b>before</b> <b>deductions</b> to receive a take-home income of £26,000.

50|$|Income tax is {{collected}} {{by means of}} a withholding tax system known as Pay-as-you-go (PAYG). For employees with only a single job, the level of taxation {{at the end of the}} year is close to the amount due, <b>before</b> <b>deductions</b> are applied. Discrepancies and deduction amounts are declared in the annual income tax return and will be part of the refund which follows after annual assessment, or alternatively reduce the taxation debt that may be payable after assessment.|$|R
50|$|An example {{might be}} as follows:An {{investor}} subscribes for shares worth $1,000,000 in a hedge fund. Over the next year the NAV of the fund increases by 10%, making the investor's shares worth $1,100,000. Of the $100,000 increase, 20% (i.e. $20,000) will {{be paid to the}} investment manager, thereby reducing the NAV of the fund by that amount and leaving the investor with shares worth $1,080,000, giving a return of 8% <b>before</b> <b>deduction</b> of any other fees.|$|R

5000|$|Note that {{although}} self-employed individuals pay 12.4%, this is mitigated two ways.

Second, the [...] "employer" [...] half is an adjustment to income {{on the front page of}} Form 1040.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{create and}} analyse a {{long-term}} history for {{various types of}} equity investment that are protected against downside risk. To do this, we estimate the performance achievable by employing modern investment technologies and markets, such as purchasing or dynamically creating portfolio insurance. We report the returns and risks {{that would have been}} experienced by a tax-exempt investor following these strategies, <b>before</b> <b>deduction</b> of management fees. We conclude that protected portfolios are relatively unattractive for the long-term investor, who would typically be better served by multi-asset diversification than by purchasing short-term portfolio insurance...|$|R
50|$|This {{would appear}} to be highly {{progressive}} - the person with the higher taxable income pays tax at twice the rate. However, if you divide the tax by the amount of gross income (i.e., <b>before</b> <b>deductions),</b> the effective rates are 11% and 23%: the higher income person's rate is still twice as high, but his deductions drive down the effective rate more quickly ((14%-11%)/14% = a 21.4% effective tax rate savings or discount at the low income bracket; (31%-23%)/31% = a 29% effective tax rate savings or discount at the higher income tax bracket).|$|R

2500|$|The current {{eligibility}} criteria attempt to address this, by including a deduction for [...] "excess shelter costs".

For the purpose of this calculation, a household's net income is obtained by subtracting certain deductions from their gross (<b>before</b> <b>deductions)</b> income. If the household's total expenditures on rent exceed 50% of that net income, then the net income is further reduced by the amount of rent that exceeds 50% of net income.
