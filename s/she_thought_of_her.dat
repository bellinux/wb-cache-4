25|$|The {{exact nature}} of her {{relationship}} with her royal sister-in-law is not clear either, and there is no evidence as to what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> other sister-in-law, Mary Boleyn, who had been at court with Jane since they were both teenagers. It is generally assumed that Jane was not overly fond of Anne, allegedly because of Jane's jealousy of her. Regardless, Jane plotted with Anne to banish one of the King's young unnamed mistresses from court in 1534. When the King discovered her involvement, Lady Rochford was herself exiled for a few months.|$|E
500|$|Her {{grandmother}} died in 1991. Years {{after her}} death, Aaliyah said her grandmother supported {{everyone in the}} family and always wanted to hear her sing, as well as admitting that she [...] "spoiled" [...] her and her brother Rashad [...] "to death." [...] She also enjoyed Aaliyah's singing and would have Aaliyah to sing for her. Aaliyah stated that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> grandmother whenever she fell into depression. Aaliyah's hands reminded her of her aunt, who died when she was [...] "very young" [...] and Aaliyah referred to her as an [...] "amazingly beautiful woman".|$|E
500|$|Miranda Keyes was {{voiced by}} Julie Benz in Halo 2, but Bungie recast the role for Halo 3, ostensibly {{because they wanted}} someone with an accent. Despite not {{being a part of}} Halo 3, Benz said that she loved voiceover work and that it was pure chance she had become the voice of Keyes in the first place. When IGN asked Benz what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> character, she {{admitted}} she hadn't played Halo 2, even though Bungie had sent her [...] "like four copies of the game." [...] The character is voiced by Justis Bolding in Halo 3.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> moving <b>her</b> {{father to}} the good hotel, but she hadn't the strength.|$|R
60|$|Her {{care was}} not for that. It was <b>her</b> sister's face <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of,</b> and <b>her</b> eyes were fixed upon it, tenderly.|$|R
60|$|She {{could not}} {{honestly}} say that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> much <b>of</b> <b>her</b> master's work. Nor, apparently, did any other person. Result, tinned meats.|$|R
2500|$|After {{winning the}} 1992 Rome Prize, {{in that year}} of {{uninterrupted}} time to pursue artistic development, Quaytman began to make a series of paintings which belonged together, which she described as [...] "sentences." [...] She cites her epiphany as [...] "The stance of the painting is the profile", after which <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> paintings {{in the context of}} the audience walking by, grouped together and observed with peripheral vision.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father, {{and with}} an effort {{dismissed}} him from her mind.|$|E
60|$|And {{then she}} gave a little sigh as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> son's {{uncertain}} search.|$|E
60|$|They {{were almost}} at hand now, and {{she lifted her}} eyes, in which the tears were fast gathering. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> nothing <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own situation--of their finding her alone with the murderer. With {{characteristic}} unselfishness <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> only <b>of</b> him.|$|R
60|$|Mary, {{when she}} heard this, seated herself on the chair that was nearest to her. For any service {{that it might be}} to her, his coming was too late. As <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> this, <b>her</b> voice left her, so that she could not speak to him.|$|R
50|$|She is a {{tall and}} {{beautiful}} woman. Lei Xiao Yu dreams for a true hero to appear and protect her. There are several men that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> as <b>her</b> true love, such as Wu Shi Lang, Li Ya Shou and Lin Chi. In the end she {{falls in love with}} the Lei family butler Chang Ling Lu, and they get married.|$|R
60|$|She {{clapped her}} hands for joy. Then <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father, and drew back from him in tears.|$|E
60|$|English Jim merely bowed {{as he went}} out, and Millicent's {{eyes grew}} dim as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> treachery to Geoffrey.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The English {{girls were}} much worse,' hastily said Gillian, with a flush of alarm, as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own friends being suspected.|$|E
5000|$|... “Looking back on {{all she had}} accomplished,” remarks Glenda Spooner, “one {{can feel}} certain that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> little <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own share {{and a great deal}} of other people’s, for that was ever her way. She was indeed {{overwhelmed}} with gratitude to those who had made the rescue of the horses possible and it was no mean achievement.” ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>thought</b> {{that one}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> slaves {{must have been}} telling tales <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> but they {{told her it was}} the parrot, and she {{resolved}} to revenge herself on him.|$|R
60|$|At {{first she}} refused to walk when they started off in the {{direction}} of the valley but after two of them had seized her by the hair and dragged her for a number <b>of</b> yards <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> better <b>of</b> <b>her</b> original decision and came along with them, though still as defiant as her bound wrists and gagged mouth would permit.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't {{make fun}} of me,' said Taffy, as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> picture-letter and the mud in the Stranger-man's hair. 'You draw it, Daddy.' ...|$|E
60|$|It was a {{critical}} time in Grace's emotional life that night. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband a good deal, and for the nonce forgot Winterborne.|$|E
6000|$|But then <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mother's rare tears glistening in her eyes, and the answer, 'Poor Alfred! I cannot {{give him}} up. Everything has been against him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|No, Anne did {{not know}} this, {{although}} she might imagine it. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> sadly <b>of</b> <b>HER</b> [...] "little mother," [...] the mother who had thought her so [...] "perfectly beautiful" [...] and who had died so long ago and was buried beside her boyish husband in that unvisited grave far away. Anne could not remember her mother {{and for this reason}} she almost envied Paul.|$|R
60|$|Indeed {{she had no}} {{fear for}} her safety; the few words which she had heard, the {{presence}} of Maria, all tended {{to point out that}} there would be no direct attempt against her life. It was only of that awful crime that <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> that crime which she had so fondly hoped that she might yet frustrate: it was of the Stadtholder's safety that <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> and <b>of</b> <b>her</b> brother's sin.|$|R
60|$|She spoke English perfectly, {{but with}} a slight Scandinavian intonation, which seemed to soften the banality <b>of</b> <b>her</b> words. Being foreign, <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> less <b>of</b> concealing <b>her</b> sympathy, and was much less fearful of venturing on {{delicate}} ground.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> rent due on Saturday and the baby's keep, {{but did not}} say anything. They {{left the}} restaurant, and in the street Philip asked her: ...|$|E
60|$|Ada's wild spirit was--we {{dare not}} say eradicated, but--thoroughly subdued at last. When <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father {{she laid her}} head on Glumm's broad chest and wept bitterly.|$|E
60|$|The {{mention of}} war-path and scalps {{had the effect}} of quieting the poor child's {{tendency}} to repartee. <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father and Little Tim, and became suddenly grave.|$|E
50|$|She {{has written}} about the guilt <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{miscarriage}} {{and the possibility that}} <b>she</b> had <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> harming <b>her</b> baby. It was only during her pregnancy that she self diagnosed her own OCD and later it was confirmed by a specialist.|$|R
60|$|She was so {{teaching}} herself, but I cannot {{say that}} the lesson was one easily learned; nor had the outrage upon <b>her</b> <b>of</b> which Will had been guilty, and which was described in the last chapter, made the teaching easier. But she had determined, nevertheless, {{that it should be}} so. When <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Will <b>her</b> heart would become very soft towards him; and sometimes, when <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> Captain Aylmer, <b>her</b> heart would become anything but soft towards him. Unloving feelings would be very strong within her bosom as she re-read his letters, and remembered that he had not come to her, but had sent her seventy-five pounds to comfort her in her trouble! Nevertheless, he was to be her husband, and she would do her duty. What might have happened had Will Belton come to Belton Castle before she had known Frederic Aylmer,--of that she stoutly resolved that she would never think at all; and consequently the thought was always intruding upon her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of {{course you}} don't know anything, going scampering {{over the country}} with the worst lot you can find, away from church and all, not caring for anything! Poor Mother! <b>she</b> never <b>thought</b> one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lads would come to that!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About my dinner-party to-morrow. Oh," [...] {{said the}} child, {{clasping}} her hands earnestly as <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> playfellows, [...] "I do so {{hope it will}} go off well!" ...|$|E
60|$|D'you suppose if {{she loved}} you {{she would have}} hesitated to come? D'you know her so little as that? <b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> child only because she was quite {{indifferent}} to you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where's my money? What {{have you}} done with that?" [...] In her {{excitement}} <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> money just as she hand handed it in-silver and little rolls and wads of bills.|$|E
6000|$|... "And did not the usages of war {{justify his}} death, Henry?" [...] inquired Frances, {{speaking}} in a low voice, unwilling to abandon what <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> the cause <b>of</b> <b>her</b> country, and yet unable to suppress her feelings for the man.|$|R
6000|$|... "O that thou hadst but been a boy!" [...] Then <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> no more <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> {{not even}} <b>of</b> Hereward: {{but all of}} which she was {{conscious}} was a breast and brain bursting; an intolerable choking, from which she must escape.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> asking <b>her</b> {{driver who}} he was, {{but she had}} found Roderick {{to be a very}} taciturn Highlander. He had not shown much {{disposition}} to converse on the way up, and his speech had not been very intelligible to her English--or Anglicised--ears. She re-entered the waggonette, therefore, in silence. Roderick drove on also in silence, although much surprised that the [...] "young shentleman" [...] had not returned with the [...] "leddy." [...] But that was none of his business [...] "what-e-ver." ...|$|R
