2500|$|An urban legend {{suggests}} {{that they were being}} 'watched' while on the Moon and had seen alien vehicles in space. This grew in popularity after the book <b>Somebody</b> <b>Else</b> <b>Is</b> on the Moon was published. Aldrin did spot an unidentified object travelling relative to them late in the third day of the mission. After learning from Mission Control that it couldn't be the S-IVB stage, since that was [...] away, they concluded that it was most likely one of four panels that had linked the spacecraft and the upper stage. Later popular accounts often described this as a [...] "UFO sighting" [...] or claimed the widely reported incident had been [...] "covered up." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And do {{you mean}} to tell me, Anne, dearie, that Dick Moore has {{turned out not to be}} Dick Moore at all but <b>somebody</b> <b>else?</b> <b>Is</b> THAT what you phoned up to me today?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'For an old man. He {{likes you}} {{better than any}} young man would take the trouble to do. I wish <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>were</b> old too.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I heard {{something}} {{about it at the}} time," [...] said Mrs. Armitage. [...] "You were very much in love with <b>somebody</b> <b>else,</b> <b>were</b> you not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But cannot <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>be</b> {{found to}} go to them? You are not as {{necessary}} there as you are here, nor so highly prized. They let you go of their own accord." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; and I'll {{tell you}} who that <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is.</b> Mind, I shouldn't say {{anything}} about it if I wasn't sure; that is almost sure; for one never can be quite sure about anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no one," [...] he said slowly, [...] "who could coerce you? You {{will not}} marry me, {{but you will}} {{probably}} marry <b>somebody</b> <b>else.</b> <b>Is</b> it, then, that you care for this other man, and not for me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If a {{man will}} cheat legally, I don't {{think he will}} stop at {{cheating}} any other way," [...] replied Hal. [...] "He may for a while, but his conscience soon gets blunted, and that's the end of it. You say the police think <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> guilty?" ...|$|E
50|$|He {{presented}} Burkina Faso at U-17 Level.He {{was also}} called {{up for an}} African Cup Of Nations preparation game for the Burkina Faso national team in 2013 {{but in the end}} <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> called up.|$|R
60|$|The rusty {{creaking}} of a pump-handle and a spatter {{of water}} upon the red-tiled courtyard showed that <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> astir, {{and a few}} steps farther he beheld a brawny, sandy-haired man gasping wildly under severe self-infliction at the pump.|$|R
60|$|SMITH. Yes. And <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> will <b>be</b> {{wandering}} {{about the}} garden now.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Stacey was convulsed. [...] "And there's Mr. Dabney--Uncle Ben," [...] he continued, [...] "eh? Very {{quiet but}} very sly. A dark horse, eh? Pretends to take lessons {{for the sake}} of being near some one, eh? Would he were a boy again because <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> a girl?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're puzzled {{about my}} saving him?" [...] Rupert rejoined. [...] "Well, I don't owe Harry much and I owe you less. On the whole, I hardly think our {{relationship}} accounts for my efforts. A bold experiment is interesting when <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> the subject, and one rather enjoys using one's skill." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I offered {{ten dollars}} finally," [...] Smoke said, [...] "and then the fellow told me he'd already sold his eggs. Now that looks bad, Shorty. <b>Somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> in the market. Those twenty-eight eggs {{are liable to}} cause us trouble. You see, {{the success of the}} corner {{consists}} in holding every last--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He didn't {{have much}} to say after I told him all I knew," [...] responded Thomas Appleby. [...] "Previous to that, he remarked that you might be mistaken {{regarding}} Merwell--that Merwell had said that Jasniff and <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>were</b> guilty of the jewelry robbery." ...|$|R
50|$|If I owned a {{newspaper}} and if I didn't {{like the way}} <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> doing things—some politician, say—I'd fight them with everything I had. Only I wouldn't show him in a convict suit with stripes—so his children could see the picture in the paper. Or his mother.|$|R
60|$|The boy hunters {{had listened}} to the {{foregoing}} conversation with intense interest. There could be no doubt but what this Barrock was the man they were after. His tale that he had procured the missing papers from <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> pure fiction---gotten up merely to deceive Andrew Felps.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lawful sakes, Polly, it kind o' renews one's {{youth to}} get a new ship done," [...] said the Captain, {{skipping}} in at another door. [...] "Sort o' puts me in mind o' that I went out cap'en in when I was jist beginning to court you, as <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> courtin' our Sally here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Poor Jack {{is one of}} {{them who}} never has a stroke of luck. He's a sort of chum who, when he has a bottle of pickles, <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> sure to eat 'em. Ahalala isn't so bad. It's one of them chancy places, of course. You may and you mayn't, as I was a-saying before. When the great rush was on, I did {{uncommon}} well at Ahalala. I never was the man I was then.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{returned}} Mrs. Sefton calmly. [...] "Nobody ever {{is convinced}} by hearsay. When {{a person has}} once seen a spirit--or thinks he has--he thenceforth believes it. And when <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> intimately associated with that person and knows all the circumstances--well, he admits the possibility, at least. That is my position. But {{by the time it}} gets to the third person--the outsider--it loses power. Besides, in this particular instance the story isn't very exciting. But then--it's true." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{just one}} moment I wished I {{was back in the}} old Vallambrosa, {{starving}} and hoping. And then I got numb, and didn't care. And then I felt that <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> in the water close by me, holding me up. He had followed me, and jumped in to save me.|$|R
5000|$|To {{attempt to}} deprive the King or his successors of his title, or {{to say that}} <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> should <b>be</b> king, was treason.|$|R
60|$|CANDIDA (laughing). No, no, no, no. Not {{jealous of}} anybody. Jealous for <b>somebody</b> <b>else,</b> who <b>is</b> not loved as {{he ought to}} be.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dearest Granville," [...] it said, {{in a very}} shaky hand, not unblurred by tears, [...] "I {{know all}} now, and I wonder you thought it could ever matter. I know you're not the eldest son, and that <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> the heir of Tilgate. And I care for all that a great deal less than nothing. I love you ten {{thousand}} times too dearly to mind one pin whether you're rich or poor. And, rich or poor, whenever you like, I'll marry you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Far from it, Comrade Windsor. The job may {{be worked}} more simply. I don't know {{how often the}} rents are {{collected}} in these places, but I should say at a venture once a week. My idea is to hang negligently round till the rent-collector arrives, and when he has loomed up on the horizon, buttonhole him and ask him quite politely, as man to man, whether he is collecting those rents for himself or for somebody else, and if somebody else, who that <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is.</b> Simple, I fancy? Yet brainy. Do you take me, Comrade Windsor?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Evans. [...] "I wish you'd let me {{know the}} result of your labours. I think I could make a very incisive article on the subject. The topic is always an {{attractive}} one. There is nobody who doesn't feel that <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> taking on airs with him, and ought to have his comb cut. Or, if you should happen to prove to Barker that his ignominy is {{in accordance with the}} Development Theory, and is a necessary Survival, or something of that sort, don't you see what a card it would be for us with the better classes?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why? why?" [...] {{broke in}} Belle. [...] "What {{is such a}} promise as that? He cannot force you to marry him, and it is better {{for a woman to}} die than to marry a man she hates, especially," [...] she added meaningly, [...] "if she happens to care for <b>somebody</b> <b>else.</b> <b>Be</b> advised by me, I know what it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If a feller had any spunk {{about him}} he would dare to do all he could while <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> thumpin' him. Jip feels bad {{for what he did}} to us, an' would stand still to let you pound him; but it couldn't have done you any good, Dan. You don't want to get the name of bein' a bruiser." ...|$|R
60|$|Here was a {{favourable}} {{opportunity to}} say that <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> had <b>been</b> a match for her. But the unfortunate governess was unequal to the task.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Jane with a sigh, [...] "I {{feel as if}} I'd lived many moons {{since the}} morning. I ought to be home {{studying}} my Virgil--that horrid old professor gave us twenty lines to start in on tomorrow. But I simply couldn't settle down to study tonight. Anne, methinks I see the traces of tears. If you've been crying DO own up. It will restore my self-respect, for I was shedding tears freely before Ruby came along. I don't mind being a goose so much if <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> goosey, too. Cake? You'll give me a teeny piece, won't you? Thank you. It has the real Avonlea flavor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What does THIS mean?" [...] he asked, {{in a low}} but fuming voice, brandishing {{the note}} before {{his eyes as he}} spoke. [...] "Is every one in the county to be told it but I? Is {{everybody}} else to hear my business before you tell me a word of it? A letter comes to me this morning--no matter from whom--and here's what it says: 'I know you're not the eldest son, and that <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> the heir of Tilgate.' Surely, if anybody was to know, I should have known it first. Surely, if I'm to be turned adrift on the world, after being brought up to think myself a man of means so long, I should, at least, be turned adrift with my eyes open." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir!" [...] {{says the}} chaplain, with some spirit; [...] "because <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> hurt, and through my fault. I have lodged {{for many years}} in London with a bootmaker, a very honest man: and, a few days since, having a perfect {{reliance}} upon--upon a friend who had promised to accommodate me with a loan--I borrowed sixty pounds from my landlord which he was about to pay to his own. I can't get the money. My poor landlord's goods will be seized for rent; his wife and dear young children will be turned into the street; and this honest family will be ruined through my fault. But, as you say, Mr. Warrington, I ought not to snivel like a woman. I will remember that you helped me once, and will bid you farewell, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|Both ladies laughed, and you laugh, too, my dear lady reader; {{but have}} you never done the same thing? Have you never altered your dress, or your arrangements, or your {{housekeeping}} because <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> of {{a different way of}} thinking or managing--and may not that very somebody at the same time have been moved to make some change through a similar observation on you? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The truth is, Mr. Spooner, {{that she}} was always {{thinking}} that <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> <b>was</b> everything. When a gentleman is told that a lady's affections have been pre-engaged, however much he may regret the circumstances, he cannot, I think, feel any hurt to his pride. If I understand the matter, Miss Palliser explained to you {{that she was}} engaged when first you spoke to her." ...|$|R
60|$|She must do that, or, she believed, {{it would}} be her duty to hand it over to <b>somebody</b> <b>else</b> who <b>was</b> better adapted by nature to use it.|$|R
