40|$|Cutaneous myiasis (flystrike), in Australia caused {{primarily}} by Lucilia cuprina [Diptera: Calliphoridae], is a debilitating, painful and potentially lethal disease of sheep. Early detection of flystrike {{is difficult and}} continual flock surveillance is required to enable timely treatment of struck <b>sheep.</b> Electronic <b>nose</b> technology offers the potential for early and automated detection of flystrike. An electronic nose consisting of six metal oxide semiconductor sensors and temperature and humidity sensors {{was used to measure}} odours collected by dynamic headspace sampling during flystrike development in four experiments and from urine- and faeces-stained fleece in one experiment. Non-linear signal measurement techniques and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were used to extract signal features and process those features for analysis of categorical separation of odour groups. The results from LDA indicated that the electronic nose accurately distinguished flystrike odour on days 1, 2 and 3 of development from that of dry wool in all experiments (P < 0. 05). The electronic nose was also able to discriminate flystrike odour on the day of larval implantation (day 0) in three of the four studies. In the experiment with urine- and faeces-stained wool, these odours were accurately distinguished from both dry wool and flystrike (P < 0. 05). This study provides proof-of-concept for the detection of flystrike using electronic nose technology. Practical methods for collection of odour in the field and suitable detection algorithms will be required for development to commercial application...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 110 lambs of the breeds Engadine Sheep and Valaisian Black <b>Nose</b> <b>Sheep</b> were fattened on one lowland and three {{different}} alpine pasture types. The experiment {{was conducted in}} two consecutive years and lasted for 9 weeks of grazing in each year. Immediately afterwards, the lambs were slaughtered. Perirenal adipose tissue and the Longissimus dorsi muscle were analysed for fatty acid composition. The lambs on the lowland pasture had the lowest proportions of linoleic and α-linolenic acid in the lipid fraction of these tissues. Additionally, {{there was a clear}} differentiation in these proportions when lambs grazed different alpine vegetation types. This was related to the content of phenolic compounds rather than the fatty acid contents of the swards, and an increasing phenolic level probably resulted in a higher ruminal protection of the native plant fatty acids. Intermediates of biohydrogenation (vaccenic acid and conjugated linoleic acid) were highest in the lowland lambs. Animal breed effects were weak...|$|R
500|$|Common {{forms of}} {{preventive}} medication for sheep are vaccinations and treatments for parasites. Both {{external and internal}} parasites are the most prevalent malady in sheep, and are either fatal, or reduce the productivity of flocks. Worms {{are the most common}} internal parasites. They are ingested during grazing, incubate within the sheep, and are expelled through the digestive system (beginning the cycle again). Oral anti-parasitic medicines, known as drenches, are given to a flock to treat worms, sometimes after worm eggs in the feces has been counted to assess infestation levels. Afterwards, sheep may be moved to a new pasture to avoid ingesting the same parasites. [...] External sheep parasites include: lice (for different parts of the body), <b>sheep</b> keds, <b>nose</b> bots, <b>sheep</b> itch mites, and maggots. Keds are blood-sucking parasites that cause general malnutrition and decreased productivity, but are not fatal. Maggots are those of the bot fly and the blow-fly. Fly maggots cause the extremely destructive condition of flystrike. Flies lay their eggs in wounds or wet, manure-soiled wool; when the maggots hatch they burrow into a sheep's flesh, eventually causing death if untreated. In addition to other treatments, crutching (shearing wool from a sheep's rump) is a common preventive method. Some countries allow mulesing, a practice that involves stripping away the skin on the rump to prevent fly-strike, normally performed when the sheep is a lamb. [...] Nose bots are fly larvae that inhabit a sheep's sinuses, causing breathing difficulties and discomfort. Common signs are a discharge from the nasal passage, sneezing, and frantic movement such as head shaking. External parasites may be controlled through the use of backliners, sprays or immersive sheep dips.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the bone development of two mountain sheep breeds during natural summer grazing either in the lowlands or on different characteristic alpine pastures. Pasture types differed in topographic slope, plant species composition, general nutritional feeding value, Ca and P content, and Ca:P ratio of herbage. Twenty-seven Engadine sheep (ES) lambs and 27 Valaisian Black <b>Nose</b> <b>sheep</b> (VS) lambs were divided into four groups of 6 to 7 animals per breed and allocated to three contrasting alpine pasture types and one lowland pasture type. The lambs were slaughtered after 9 wk of experimental grazing. The steep alpine pastures in combination with a high (4. 8) to very high (13. 6) Ca:P ratio in the forage decreased total bone mineral content as measured {{in the middle of}} the left metatarsus of the lambs from both breeds, and cortical bone mineral content and cortical bone mineral density of ES lambs. Breed × pasture type interactions occurred in the development of total and cortical bone mineral content, and in cortical thickness, indicating that bone metabolism of different genotypes obviously profited differently from the varying conditions. An altitude effect occurred for 25 -hydroxyvitamin D with notably higher serum concentrations on the three alpine sites, and a breed effect led to higher concentrations for ES than VS. Despite a high variance, there were pasture-type effects on serum markers of bone formation and resorption...|$|R
40|$|Lambs of two Swiss {{mountain}} breeds, Engadine Sheep (ES; n= 55) and Valaisian Black <b>Nose</b> <b>Sheep</b> (VS; n= 55), were fattened in 2010 and 2011 on one lowland {{and three}} alpine pastures. Groups {{of six to}} seven lambs per breed were allocated to pastures of a size allowing ad libitum intake on the following four vegetation types: (i) species-poor and nutrient-rich lowland (400  m a. s. l.) ryegrass–clover ley on flat terrain (‘lowland-rich’); (ii) alpine, species-rich and nutrient-rich vegetation type on a flat terrain (1950  m; ‘alpine-rich’); (iii) alpine, species-rich vegetation type, moderate in nutrients on steep terrain (2150  m; ‘alpine-moderate’); and (iv) alpine, species-rich and nutrient-poor vegetation type on steep terrain (2150  m; ‘alpine-poor’). Lambs were slaughtered after 9 weeks of grazing in a commercial slaughterhouse. Carcasses were subjected to the Swiss CH-TAX classification grid. Meat quality was analysed on the Musculus longissimus dorsi (LD) in the segment of Musculus longissimus lumborum. Forage quality varied among vegetation types as anticipated. Across all sites, ES were superior (P< 0. 001) to VS in dressing percentage (43. 9 vs. 38. 4), carcass weight (18. 4 vs. 16. 4  kg), meat conformation and fat cover scores, even though daily gains had been lower (105 vs. 122  g/d; P< 0. 05). Meat of ES contained more dry matter, protein, total ash (P< 0. 001) and fat (P< 0. 05). Their meat was darker and more intensive red, had lower cooking losses (23. 0 vs. 25. 1 %) but was less tender (65. 6 vs. 58. 1  N) compared to VS (P< 0. 001). Vegetation types offering good quality forage (lowland-rich and alpine-rich) enhanced average daily gains, dressing percentage, meat conformation and fat cover scores (mostly P< 0. 05 against alpine-moderate and -poor). Similarly, a higher vegetation quality promoted a higher intramuscular fat and lower cooking losses. Meat from lowland-rich was darkest and had the lowest shear force (P< 0. 05). Almost no breed×site interactions occurred in growth performance as well as carcass and meat quality. It was therefore concluded that both breeds are similarly well adapted to the extensive pasture production system in alpine regions. Still, ES {{seem to be the}} more efficient one of the two sheep breeds. The results also indicate that growth performance and meat quality clearly vary between vegetation types in animals grazing alpine pastures...|$|R
40|$|The special {{quality of}} foods from alpine grazing systems {{concerning}} their fatty acid (FA) composition is well established. However, {{the contribution of}} different specific vegetationtypes and the animal’s genotype to this alpine effect is still unclear. In the present study,the FA profiles of muscle and adipose tissue lipids were determined in lambs that hadgrazed either an intensively managed lowland pasture or one of three characteristic alpinevegetation types differing in plant species number and composition, forage quality andamount, and composition of phenolic compounds and FA. On each vegetation type and intwo subsequent years, two groups of lambs (seven Engadine sheep, ES; and seven ValaisianBlack <b>Nose</b> <b>sheep,</b> VS) grazed for 9 weeks and were subsequently slaughtered (total n = 110 lambs). Forage samples, meat (Longissimus dorsi muscle, LD) and perirenal adipose tissuewere analysed for their FA composition. Forages were additionally analysed for contentsof phenolic compounds. Although proportions of a-linolenic acid (C 18 : 3 n- 3) and linoleicacid (C 18 : 2 n- 6) in plant biomass were clearly higher in the lowland compared to the alpinevegetation, the proportions of these FA were increased in the adipose tissue of alpine graz-ing sheep by 20 – 87 % and by 26 – 58 % in muscle compared to lowland grazing, dependingon the alpine vegetation type. The levels of these two FA in body tissues differed betweenlambs having grazed different alpine pastures and were clearly positively associated withthe contents of phenolic compounds in the vegetation but not with its lipid composition. Compared to the lowland pasture, conjugated linoleic acid (C 18 : 2 c 9 t 11) in the tissues waslower when the lambs grazed alpine pastures, but did not differ between the alpine vegeta-tion types. Slight breed differences were found, with a trend for higher proportions of longchain polyunsaturated FA at cost of saturated and monounsaturated FA in the VS comparedto the ES. In conclusion, vegetation type {{is an important factor}} determining the FA com-position in lamb meat and differentiating the alpine effect in this respect. The data clearlysuggest that the plant secondary compounds in the swards prevented part of C 18 : 3 n- 3 andC 18 : 2 n- 6 from being hydrogenated in the rumen. Tissue-specific differences in incorporation of C 18 : 2 n- 6 and C 18 : 3 n- 3 point to a physiological optimum level in the muscle but notin the adipose tissue...|$|R
