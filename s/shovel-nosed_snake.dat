50|$|In the Darwin Falls Wilderness area {{include many}} {{reptiles}} that are seen near the Mojave Desert such as lizards, snakes, and rattlesnakes {{such as the}} Mojave rattlesnake, and the western diamondback rattlesnake. Also they are western desert tortoises and common snakes such as gopher snakes, long-nosed snake, and the western <b>shovel-nosed</b> <b>snake.</b>|$|E
50|$|The western black-headed snake is {{a member}} of a larger natural group of small New World {{terrestrial}} colubrids, where some of the related species include sand snake (Chilomeniscus), <b>shovel-nosed</b> <b>snake</b> (Chionactis), and the ground snake (Sonora). The western black-headed snake is the sister species of Tantilla yaquia of southern Arizona. They are also related to Tantilla gracilis, Tantilla atriceps, Tantilla hobartsmithi and Tantilla nigriceps, all species endemic to the southwestern United States. It is visually similar to the southwestern black-headed snake (T. hobartsmithi). Although they usually appear singly or in pairs, as many as six individual snakes have been observed together. They prey on arthropods, particularly centipedes and beetle larvae, as well as spiders, insects, slugs and earthworms. They are highly secretive and rarely seen, spending much time under objects, especially during daytime.|$|E

50|$|Brachyurophis is a genus of elapid <b>snakes</b> {{known as}} <b>shovel-nosed</b> <b>snakes,</b> {{so named because}} of their shovel-nosed snout {{which is used to}} burrow. The genus has seven {{recognized}} species, which are all found in Australia.|$|R
40|$|A {{diversity}} of animals {{move on and}} bury within dry and wet granular media, such as dry desert sand or rainforest soils. Little {{is known about the}} biomechanics and neural control strategies used to move within these complex terrains. Burial and subsurface locomotion provides a particularly interesting behavior in which to study principles of interaction because the entire body becomes surrounded by the granular environment. In this dissertation, we used three model organisms to elucidate control principles of movement within granular substrates: the sand-specialist sandfish lizard which dives into dry sand using limb-ground interactions, and swims subsurface using body undulations; the long-slender <b>shovel-nosed</b> <b>snake</b> which undulates subsurface in dry sand with low slip; and the ocellated skink, a desert generalist which buries into both wet and dry substrates. Using muscle activation measurements we discovered that the sandfish targeted optimal kinematics which maximized forward speed and minimized the mechanical cost of transport. The simplicity of the sandfish body and kinematics coupled with a fluid-like model of the granular media revealed the fundamental mechanism responsible for neuromechanical phase lags, a general timing phenomenon between muscle activation and curvature along the body that has been observed in all undulatory animals that move in a variety of environments. Kinematic experiments revealed that the snake moved subsurface using a similar locomotion strategy as the sandfish, but its long body and low skin friction enabled higher performance (lower slip). The ocellated skink used a different locomotor pattern than observed in the sandfish and snake but that was sufficient for burial into both wet and dry media. Furthermore, the ocellated skink could only reach shallow burial depths in wet compared to dry granular media. We attribute this difference to the higher resistance forces in wet media and hypothesize that the burial efficacy is force-limited. These studies reveal basic locomotor principles of burial and subsurface movement in granular media and demonstrate the impact of environmental interaction in locomotor behavior. Ph. D...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{delineation}} of lineage {{diversity is}} increasingly important, as species distributions {{are becoming more}} reduced and threatened. During the last century, the subspecies category was often used to denote phenotypic variation within a species range {{and to provide a}} framework for understanding lineage differentiation, often considered incipient speciation. While this category has largely fallen into disuse, previously recognized subspecies often serve as important units for conservation policy and management when other information is lacking. In this study, we evaluated phenotypic subspecies hypotheses within <b>shovel-nosed</b> <b>snakes</b> on the basis of genetic data and considered how evolutionary processes such as gene flow influenced possible incongruence between phenotypic and genetic patterns. We used both traditional phylogenetic and Bayesian clustering analyses to infer range-wide genetic structure and spatially explicit analyses to detect possible boundary locations of lineage contact. Multilocus analyses supported three historically isolated groups with low to moderate levels of contemporary gene exchange. Genetic data did not support phenotypic subspecies as exclusive groups, and we detected patterns of discordance in areas where three subspecies are presumed to be in contact. Based on genetic and phenotypic evidence, we suggested that species-level diversity is underestimated in this group and we proposed that two species be recognized, Chionactis occipitalis and C. annulata. In addition, we recommend retention of two subspecific designations within C. annulata (C. a. annulata and C. a. klauberi) that reflect regional shifts in both genetic and phenotypi...|$|R
