500|$|The Ashland Mill Bridge was a {{lenticular}} pony {{truss bridge}} over the Pachaug River in Griswold, Connecticut that was built in 1886 by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company. It was built following the Ashland dam break of February 1886 which washed away the previous bridges. The bridge served the millyard of the Ashland Cotton Company, in the Jewett City section of Griswold. [...] The bridge was [...] long and crossed a millrace on a <b>skew</b> <b>angle.</b> The Ashland Mill was damaged by arson in March 1994 and subsequently torn down, but the bridge itself remained. By 1999, the town deemed the bridge unsafe and closed it, and by February 1999, the bridge was moved to a vacant parking lot and was replaced with a new bridge. The bridge {{was added to the}} state of Connecticut historic register and it was later added to the National Register of Historic Places in April 1999. [...] It was removed from the National Register in February 2016.|$|E

These text lines may have different orientations or text lines may be arc or cone or curved shape. For the optical character recognition of these documents, we need to detect <b>skewed</b> <b>angle</b> properly. In this paper we present a new technique to estimate <b>skew</b> <b>angles</b> of cone shaped text lines. The method divides the whole text line image into number of divisions. The width of division is defined by 4 columns. The method extracts the coordinates of top pixel, bottom pixel and mid pixel from each division of text line. These coordinates are subjected to linear regression analysis separately to estimate <b>skew</b> <b>angles.</b> The touching point of two text lines is identified based on study of continuous and consistent <b>skew</b> <b>angles</b> obtained by the method. The continuous and consistent <b>skew</b> <b>angles</b> are obtained by appending the number of divisions from left to right. Based on touching point the method identifies two different <b>skew</b> <b>angles</b> for two different oriented touching lines. The cone shaped text line is corrected into single horizontal line using two different <b>skew</b> <b>angles.</b> The experimental results shows that the method works satisfactorily...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSES: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the optimal joint positions which can minimize distresses of concrete pavement containing box culvert with horizontally <b>skewed</b> <b>angles.</b> METHODS: The concrete pavement containing the box culvert with different <b>skewed</b> <b>angles</b> and soil cover depths was modeled by 3 dimensional finite element method. The contact boundary condition was used between concrete and soil structures in addition to the nonlinear material property of soil in the finite element model. A dynamic analysis was performed by applying the self weight of pavement, negative temperature gradient of slab, and moving vehicle load simultaneously. RESULTS: In case of zero <b>skewed</b> <b>angle</b> (0 。), the maximum tensile stress of slab was the lowest when the joint was positioned directly over side of box culvert. In case there was a <b>skewed</b> <b>angle,</b> the maximum tensile stress of slab was the lowest when the joint passed the intersection between side of the box culvert and longitudinal centerline of slab. The magnitude of the maximum tensile stress converged to a constant value regardless the joint position from 3 m of soil cover depth at all of the horizontally <b>skewed</b> <b>angles.</b> CONCLUSIONS: More reasonable and accurate design of the concrete pavement containing the box culvert can be possible based on th...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, an {{equation}} for {{the calculation of}} the frictional torque of a dry-lubricated tapered roller bearing (TRB) is provided in which {{the effect of the}} roller skewing is emphasized. Calculations were performed to investigate the effect of the roller skewing on the torque of dry-lubricated TRB for two representative preload methods, that is, axial force preload and axial displacement preload. The results show that a proper roller <b>skewing</b> <b>angle</b> under axial force preload benefits the reduction of the TRB torque. However, the roller <b>skewing</b> <b>angle</b> should not exceed a certain critical value; otherwise, it will cause a steep rise in the TRB torque. Finally, the critical value of the roller <b>skewing</b> <b>angle</b> {{as a function of the}} friction coefficient and cage pocket clearance is presented. The developed torque model provides a tool for the internal design and torque optimization of dry-lubricated TRBs.|$|R
40|$|A simple C degrees isoparametric {{finite element}} model, {{based on a}} higher-order shear {{deformation}} theory is presented for the free vibration analysis of isotropic, orthotropic, and layered anisotropic composite and sandwich skew laminates. This theory incorporates a realistic nonlinear variation of displacements through the laminate thickness, and eliminates the use of shear correction coefficients. The boundary conditions on the skew edges are imposed through the suitable transformation of element matrices. The accuracy of the present model is demonstrated by comparing with alternative solutions available in the literature. Extensive numerical results are presented for natural frequencies of cross-ply and angle-ply skew laminates with various lamination parameters, <b>skew</b> <b>angles,</b> boundary conditions, and width-to-thickness ratios.

40|$|Concrete multicell box-girder bridges are {{a common}} choice among the {{designers}} for various ranges of bridges. In order to provide safer and greater speed of traffic, the roadway is built as straight as possible. The use of skewed bridges has increased considerably {{in the recent years}} for roadway. The skewed bridges have quite different mechanical behavior from the straight bridges, although for <b>skew</b> <b>angles</b> less than 20 degrees, it is reasonably safe to ignore the effect of <b>skew</b> <b>angles</b> and analyze that at the straight bridge. In this study, in developing an analytical solution, an extensive parametric study was carried out to determine the maximum positive and negative stress distribution factors and to calculate the maximum distribution factor of deflection along the mid-span of skewed multicell box-girder bridges. A total of 240 representative bridges numerical models were selected and analyzed using SAP 2000 finite element software. It was found that the span length, number of boxes, number of lanes and <b>skew</b> <b>angles</b> significantly affected the distribution factors of stress and deflection.

2500|$|When {{considering}} {{the balance of}} forces within a regular arch, in which all courses of masonry {{that make up the}} barrel are parallel with its abutments and perpendicular to its faces, it is convenient to consider it as a two-dimensional object by taking a vertical section through the body of the arch and parallel with its faces, thereby ignoring any variation in loading along the length of its barrel. In an oblique or skew arch the axis of the barrel is deliberately not perpendicular to the faces, the deviation from perpendicularity being known as the <b>skew</b> <b>angle</b> or the [...] "obliquity" [...] of the arch.|$|E

2500|$|The {{strength}} of a regular arch (also known as a [...] "square" [...] or [...] "right" [...] arch) {{comes from the fact}} that the mass of the structure and its superincumbent load cause lines of force that are carried by the stones into the ground and the abutments without producing any tendency for the stones to slide with respect to one another. This is due to the fact that the courses of stone are laid parallel to the abutments, which in a regular arch causes them also to lie perpendicular to its faces. For only slightly oblique bridges, where the <b>skew</b> <b>angle</b> is less than approximately 15° it is possible to use the same construction method, laying the stones in courses parallel to the abutments. The result is known as a [...] "false" [...] skew arch and analysis of the forces within it shows that in each corner where the face forms an acute angle with an abutment there are resultant forces that are not perpendicular to the planes of the stone courses whose tendency is to push the stones out of the face, the only resistance to this being provided by friction and the adhesion of the mortar between the stones.|$|E

2500|$|Modern {{regulations}} {{prevented the}} installation of a replacement hump-backed bridge, so restoration required the canal to burrow underneath, leaving the road at its existing level.

[...] At {{the southern end of the}} length, Brewhurst Lock was reconstructed reducing its fall to [...] from the original drop of , and hence lowering the level of the water in the pound crossed by the bridge. [...] At the other end, a new lock (Loxwood Lock) was constructed, to provide for the [...] difference between the new and original levels of the canal.

The new bridge crosses the canal on a <b>skew</b> <b>angle,</b> the resulting 'tunnel' through which the canal passes measures [...] The towpath runs through the tunnel, alongside the canal, and also allows pedestrians to cross the road safely; however, the restricted bridge height means horse riders must cross at road level. Suitable access pathways had to be designed-in as the towpath is a bridleway at this point. The work was completed, and the first boat passed under the new bridge into the new Loxwood Lock in April 2009. The project cost £1.8 million, making it one of the most expensive projects to be undertaken by a volunteer canal trust, and was officially opened by Lord Sterling of Plaistow on 9 May.
