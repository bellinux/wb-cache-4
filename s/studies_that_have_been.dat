25|$|Lewis Campbell was {{the first}} to make {{exhaustive}} use of stylometry to prove objectively that the Critias, Timaeus, Laws, Philebus, Sophist, and Statesman were all clustered together as a group, while the Parmenides, Phaedrus, Republic, and Theaetetus belong to a separate group, which must be earlier (given Aristotle's statement in his Politics that the Laws was written after the Republic; cf. Diogenes Laertius Lives 3.37). What is remarkable about Campbell's conclusions is that, {{in spite of all the}} stylometric <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> conducted since his time, perhaps the only chronological fact about Plato's works that can now be said to be proven by stylometry is the fact that Critias, Timaeus, Laws, Philebus, Sophist, and Statesman are the latest of Plato's dialogues, the others earlier.|$|E
25|$|SS is {{the third}} most common rheumatic {{autoimmune}} disorder, behind rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). There are no geographical differences in the rates of SS. SS {{has been reported in}} all areas of the world, although regional rates have not been well studied. Depending on the criteria for determining prevalence, studies estimate the prevalence of SS at 500,000 to 2 million people in the United States. Moreover, other broader studies of prevalence of SS range widely with some reports of up to a prevalence of 3% of the population. A few <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> conducted on the incidence of SS report that the incidence of the syndrome varies between 3 and 6 per 100,000 per year.|$|E

25|$|The fashion {{industry}} {{is known for}} not being inclusive of more races in their runways and ad campaigns, and several <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> conducted prove {{that the lack of}} racial diversity can contribute to body image issues amongst non-white minorities. In one such experiment, conducted in 2003, 3 photographs of attractive white, black and Asian women were shown to a group of white, black and Asian students. The study concluded that Asian women thought that the photograph of the white woman was the most attractive, and reported high levels of body dissatisfaction. Such dissatisfaction may even cause these individuals to suffer psychologically due to the pressure to embody these ideals, and may result in them going through several means to change their physical appearance in order to match the Eurocentric idea of beauty.|$|E
25|$|Right {{hemisphere}} damage {{can lead}} to aprosodia—the inability to produce or comprehend emotional prosody of language. Emotional prosody is typically conveyed and interpreted through changes in pitch, rhythm, or loudness (Leon et al., 2005). Research thus far has focused primarily on motoric-imitative and cognitive-linguistic approaches to prosody treatment. In a motoric-imitative approach, the client imitates clinician-modeled sentences produced with target emotional prosody. Modeling and cueing is gradually reduced following a six-step hierarchy until the client reaches independent production. In the cognitive-linguistic approach, the client is prompted to produce sentences {{with the support of}} cue cards. Cues include the name of the target emotion, the vocal characteristics of the emotional tone, and a picture of a corresponding facial expression. Again, cues are gradually removed as the client progresses toward independent production. Clinical studies of small groups of participants (four participants; 14 participants.) revealed statistically significant gains in the production of emotional prosody following treatment. Additional research is needed to replicate the results of the limited <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> conducted thus far, to evaluate the efficacy of additional treatment approaches, and to compare the relative efficacy of different approaches.|$|E
25|$|Sexual {{relationships}} between {{doctors and patients}} can create ethical conflicts, since sexual consent may conflict with the fiduciary responsibility of the physician. Out of the many disciplines in current medicine, there are <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> conducted in order to ascertain the occurrence of Doctor-Patient sexual misconduct. Results from those studies appear to indicate that certain disciplines {{are more likely to}} be offenders than others. Psychiatrists and Obstetrician-Gynecologists for example, are two disciplines noted for having a higher rate of sexual misconduct. The violation of ethical conduct between doctors and patients also has an association with the age and sex of doctor and patient. Male physicians aged 40–49 and 50–59 years are two groups that have been found to be more likely to have been reported for sexual misconduct, while women aged 20–39 have been found to make up a significant portion of reported victims of sexual misconduct. Doctors who enter into sexual relationships with patients face the threats of losing their medical license and prosecution. In the early 1990s, it was estimated that 2-9% of doctors had violated this rule. Sexual {{relationships between}} physicians and patients' relatives may also be prohibited in some jurisdictions, although this prohibition is highly controversial.|$|E

2500|$|Orthomolecular therapies {{have been}} criticized as lacking a {{sufficient}} evidence base for clinical use: their scientific foundations are too weak, the <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> performed are too few and too open to interpretation, and reported positive findings in observational studies are contradicted {{by the results of}} more rigorous clinical trials. Accordingly, [...] "there is no evidence that orthomolecular medicine is effective". Proponents of orthomolecular medicine strongly dispute this statement by citing studies demonstrating the effectiveness of treatments involving vitamins, though this ignores the belief that a normal diet will provide adequate nutrients to avoid deficiencies, and that orthomolecular treatments are not actually related to vitamin deficiency. The lack of scientifically rigorous testing of orthomolecular medicine has led to its practices being classed with other forms of alternative medicine and regarded as unscientific. It has been described as food faddism and quackery, with critics arguing that it is based upon an [...] "exaggerated belief in the effects of nutrition upon health and disease." [...] Orthomolecular practitioners will often use dubious diagnostic methods to define what substances are [...] "correct"; one example is hair analysis, which produces spurious results when used in this fashion.|$|E
2500|$|Proponents {{and opponents}} have been both criticized for overstating the {{benefits}} or overstating the risks, and understating the other, respectively. Systematic reviews have cited {{the lack of}} high quality research for the benefits and risks of water fluoridation and questions that are still unsettled. [...] A 2007 Nuffield Council on Bioethics report concluded that good evidence for or against water fluoridation is lacking. Researchers who oppose the practice state this as well. According to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report on fluoride in drinking water, these gaps in the fluoridation scientific literature fuel the controversy. John Doull, chairman of the 2006 National Research Council committee report on fluoride in drinking water, has stated a similar conclusion regarding {{the source of the}} controversy: [...] "In the scientific community, people tend to think this is settled. I mean, when the U.S. surgeon general comes out and says {{this is one of the}} 10 greatest achievements of the 20th century, that’s a hard hurdle to get over. But when we looked at the <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> done, we found that many of these questions are unsettled and we have much less information than we should, considering how long this [...] has been going on. I think that’s why fluoridation is still being challenged so many years after it began. In the face of ignorance, controversy is rampant." ...|$|E

2500|$|Research {{with animal}} models that are {{irradiated}} with HZE nuclei {{has shown that}} important changes to the CNS occur with the dose levels that are of concern to NASA. However, {{the significance of these}} results on the morbidity to astronauts has not been elucidated. One model of late tissue effects [...] suggests that significant effects will occur at lower doses, but with increased latency. It is to be noted that the <b>studies</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> conducted to date have been carried out with relatively small numbers of animals (<10 per dose group); therefore, testing of dose threshold effects at lower doses (< 0.5 Gy) has not been carried out sufficiently at this time. As the problem of extrapolating space radiation effects in animals to humans will be a challenge for space radiation research, such research could become limited by the population size that is used in animal studies. Furthermore, the role of dose protraction has not been studied to date. An approach to extrapolate existing observations to possible cognitive changes, performance degradation, or late CNS effects in astronauts has not been discovered. New approaches in systems biology offer an exciting tool to tackle this challenge. Recently, eight gaps were identified for projecting CNS risks. Research on new approaches to risk assessment may be needed to provide the necessary data and knowledge to develop risk projection models of the CNS from space radiation.|$|E
2500|$|Feuerhake (2004: 7) reports that, {{looking at}} {{released}} <b>studies,</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> conducted, {{it can be}} seen that all four competence areas2 are affected. Though some of these seem more likely to be affected than others, e.g. grammar and lexical knowledge are more likely to suffer a high attrition process. Showing loss in speaking competence, the first evidence is that the speech tempo decreases. Longer and more frequently occurring speech pauses, under which the fluency is suffering, are observable as well (Gardner 1987). Olshtain (1986) observed [...] " [...] reduced accessibility in vocabulary retrieval in all situations of attrition where there is a reduction of language loss over longer periods of time." [...] (1986: 163). Further, gaps concerning grammatical knowledge, especially tenses and conjunction of verbs occur quite frequently. Nevertheless, it can be said that productive skills are more affected than receptive ones, which mainly remain constantly stable (Cohen 1989) and if the learner shows already signs of language attrition it is more likely that transfer from L1 will happen (Berman & Olshtain 1983). Cohen examined in his studies several strategies, the learner applies to compensate the lack of adequate speaking skills, e.g. one strategy is code-switching, to uphold the communication. Another phenomenon observable is a kind of [...] "mixed-language". Müller (1995) states that on many levels of speaking the learner falls back on a mixture between different languages. Still, it is important to mention, that, as with almost every study that has been conducted in the different sub-fields of second-language acquisition research, several problems arise. There are longitudinal vs. cross-sectional studies, different variables, which have been used, and mainly terms and conditions of acquisition and incubation period are not standardised, particularly the length of the incubation period (Feuerhake 2004: 8). That means, some studies only observe language attrition after language programs, other look at the attrition in between breaks of language programs and studies, which examine the attrition after change of environment, regarding language and living conditions (Cohen 1975, Olshtain 1989). Finally, studies reviewed in this paper show that attrition follows a certain order, e.g. productive skills are more affected than receptive skills. Mainly due to difficulties in lexical retrieval a loss in fluency seems to be the first signs of language attrition, followed by attrition in morphology and syntax. Further observations in language attrition are necessary, to give a better understanding of how the human mind deals with language (Hansen 1999: 78).|$|E
