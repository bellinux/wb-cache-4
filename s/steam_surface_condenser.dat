Notable developments include the <b>steam</b> <b>surface</b> <b>condenser,</b> which eliminated the use of sea water in the ship's boilers.

40|$|Abstract: An {{experimental}} set up is {{made for}} an air-cooled condenser and observations are obtained at different air velocities. The comparisons are done between various quantities like pressure of steam, mass flow rate, velocity of air, and temperature difference of inlet steam and Outlet steam. It is found that mass flow rate of condensed steam decreases with decrease in pressure of Steam. It also decreases with decrease in Temperature difference. So the capacity of Air cooled condenser is sometimes limited by ambient conditions, but due to other problems concerned with reduced availability of water as the cooling medium for the condensation of exhaust steam, combined with an increased emphasis on environmental considerations. {{it is still a}} better alternative than traditional <b>steam</b> <b>surface</b> <b>condenser...</b>|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA comparison between {{a computer model}} of a <b>steam</b> <b>surface</b> <b>condenser</b> and data from a machinery test of a DDG- 37 class engineering plant is provided. Using ORCON 1, a computer code developed by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a comparison between a computer model and actual data was made {{in an attempt to}} verify the code. The sensitivities of ORCON 1 to changes in inputs were explored to determine the effect of inaccuracies in the data. Results show that, especially at lower steaming rates, ORCON 1 provides a fair model of the condenser. A change was made to ORCON 1 to account for vapor velocity effects in the condenser. This change improved the correlations between the code's output and the data. Other changes to the code are proposed. Continued attempts to verify ORCON 1 and further study in improving the code are recommended. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|A quasi-three {{dimensional}} computer {{algorithm is}} developed to simulate fluid flow and heat transfer {{in the shell}} side of a power plant <b>steam</b> <b>surface</b> <b>condenser.</b> The pressure drop balance approach is {{used to determine the}} inlet mass flow rate. Both air blanket and inundation effects are taken into account. The porous medium issued to model the tube bank, and the eddy viscosity model is used to calculate the turbulent viscosity. The governing equations are solved in primitive variable form using a semi-implicit consistent formulation in which a segregated correction linked algorithm is employed. Sensitivity studies are carried out for four different correlations of condensation heat transfer coefficient, differing inundation factors as well as different turbulent viscosity models. The numerical predictions of an experimental steam condenser are critically assessed by comparison against available experimental data. The results indicate that solutions obtained by employing the numerical technique developed in this study are in good agreement with experimental data.

40|$|In this study, {{the thermal}} {{analysis}} {{for the impact of}} the cooling seawater site specific conditions on the thermal efficiency of a conceptual pressurized water reactor nuclear power plant (PWR NPP) is presented. The PWR NPP thermal performance depends upon the heat transfer analysis of <b>steam</b> <b>surface</b> <b>condenser</b> accounting for the key parameters such as the cooling seawater salinity and temperature that affect the condenser overall heat transfer coefficient and fouling factor. The study has two aspects: the first one is the impact of the temperature and salinity within a range of (290 [*]K– 310 [*]K and 0. 00 – 60000 [*]ppm) on the seawater thermophysical properties such as density, specific heat, viscosity, and thermal conductivity that reflect a reduction in the condenser overall heat transfer coefficient from 2. 25 [*]kW/m 2 [*]K to 1. 265 [*]kW/m 2 [*]K at temperature and salinity of 290 [*]K and 0. 00 [*]ppm and also from 2. 35 [*]kW/m 2 [*]K to 1. 365 [*]kW/m 2 [*]K at temperature and salinity of 310 [*]K and 60000 [*]ppm, whereas the second aspect is the fouling factor variations due to the seawater salinity.

40|$|Most of the {{electricity}} being produced throughout the world today is from steam power plants. At the same time, many other competent means of gener-ating electricity have been developed viz. electricity from natural gas, MHD generators, biogas, solar cells, etc. But steam power plants {{will continue to be}} competent because of the use of water as the main working fluid which is abundantly available and is also reusable. The condenser remains among one of the key components of a steam power plant. The efficiency of a thermal power plant depends upon the efficiency of the condenser. In this paper, a the-oretical investigation about thermal analysis and design considerations of a steam condenser has been undertaken. A hybrid steam condenser using a higher surface area to diameter ratio of cooling a water tube has been analyzed. The use of a hybrid steam condenser enables higher efficiency of the steam power plant by lowering condenser steam pressure and increasing the vacuum inside the con-denser. The latent/sensible heat of steam is used to preheat the feed water supply to the boiler.

40|$|Comparison of {{material}} usage {{and cost of}} two types of cross-flow steam condensers is reported in this study {{which can be used}} for water desalination in conjunction with a parabolic trough solar energy concentrator plant. Traditional shell and tube condensers (where steam flows inside the tubes) and <b>surface</b> condensers (where <b>steam</b> flows in the shell and cooling water flows in the tubes) are considered in this study. It has been found that the energy production from the PTC of dimensions 4. 5 m × 4. 8 m with an aperture area of 21. 6 m 2 was 19. 4 kW. It has been calculated that the distilled water production capacity of the solar energy harnessing system per day is 55. 6 l, assuming solar irradiance to be 0. 9 kW m- 2 and the efficiency of solar energy harnessing system as 50 % if the sun is available for four hours. The cooling water input temperature was assumed to be 30 °C. The minimum length required for a SS 304 tube of Ø 9. 5 mm was 7. 16 m for the traditional condenser and 1. 30 m for the <b>surface</b> <b>condenser.</b> The efficiency of the traditional condenser reduced due to the formation of a condensed water layer {{on the surface of the}} tube, as it acts as a thermal barrier. However, in the <b>surface</b> <b>condenser,</b> efficiency was enhanced due to easy condensation while increasing the system pressure. Further, efficiency is enhanced due to density separation of wet vapour by changing the flow direction near the wet sump.
