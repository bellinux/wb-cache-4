5|$|However, {{contrary}} to {{the expectations of the}} Red Queen hypothesis, Hanley et al. found that the prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of mites was <b>significantly</b> <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> sexual geckos than in asexuals sharing the same habitat. Furthermore, Parker, after reviewing numerous genetic studies on plant disease resistance, failed to find a single example consistent with the concept that pathogens are the primary selective agent responsible for sexual reproduction in their host. At an even more fundamental level, Heng and Gorelick and Heng reviewed evidence that sex, rather than enhancing diversity, acts as a constraint on genetic diversity. They considered that sex acts as a coarse filter, weeding out major genetic changes, such as chromosomal rearrangements, but permitting minor variation, such as changes at the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral) to pass through the sexual sieve. The adaptive function of sex, today, remains a major unresolved issue in biology. The competing models to explain the adaptive function of sex were reviewed by Birdsell and Wills. A principal alternative view to the Red Queen hypothesis is that sex arose, and is maintained, as a process for repairing DNA damage, and that genetic variation is produced as a byproduct.|$|E

Most births were recorded in large herds in the sour rangelands during the hot-wet season (P < 0. 05). Farmers with large herd sizes purchased significantly more cattle compared to those with small herd sizes. Cattle sales were <b>significantly</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> the large herds in the cool-dry season. Mortality was <b>significantly</b> <b>high</b> <b>in</b> the hot-wet season in the sour rangeland and was mainly caused by gall-sickness (24 %) and redwater (20 %).
