5|$|The {{accessory}} <b>saphenous</b> <b>vein</b> (ASV), either anterior or posterior, is {{an important}} GSV collateral frequently responsible for varicose veins located on the anterior and lateral aspect of the thigh.|$|E
5|$|The small <b>saphenous</b> <b>vein</b> (SSV), {{runs along}} the {{posterior}} aspect of the leg {{as far as the}} popliteal region, in the upper calf. Here it enters the popliteal space which is located between the two heads of the gastrocnemius muscle where it usually drains above the knee joint in the popliteal vein or a little less often in the great <b>saphenous</b> <b>vein</b> (GSV) or other deep muscular veins of the thigh. The use of ultrasonography has allowed a number of variations to be shown at this level; when no contact is made with the popliteal vein it might be seen to drain in the GSV, at a variable level; or, it may merge with the Giacomini vein and drain in the GSV at the superior 1/3 of the thigh. It can also but rarely, drain in the vein of the semimembranosus (thigh muscle) (shown below). Usually though, it connects with a perforator vein at its middle 1/3. To check for insufficiency, the Paraná maneuver is very useful.|$|E
5|$|Normal {{blood flow}} is {{anterograde}} (going to the heart), and from superficial to deep veins via perforator veins. However, {{there are two}} exceptions: firstly, the great <b>saphenous</b> <b>vein</b> (GSV) collaterals, (the veins that run parallel), drain the abdominal wall and have a flow {{from top to bottom}} so that when an examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction, a false positive diagnosis might be made; secondly, in the flow from the sole of the foot venous network around 10% drains to the dorsal venous arch of the foot, going therefore against the norm, from deep to superficial veins.|$|E

40|$|<b>Saphenous</b> <b>veins</b> used as {{arterial}} grafts {{are exposed}} to arterial levels of oxygen partial pres-sure (pO 2), which are much greater than what they experience in their native environment. The object {{of this study is}} to determine the impact of exposing human <b>saphenous</b> <b>veins</b> to ar-terial pO 2. <b>Saphenous</b> <b>veins</b> and left internal mammary arteries from consenting patients un-dergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were cultured ex vivo for 2 weeks in the presence of arterial or venous pO 2 using an established organ culture model. <b>Saphenous</b> <b>veins</b> cul-tured with arterial pO 2 developed intimal hyperplasia as evidenced by 2. 8 -fold greater intimal area and 5. 8 -fold increase in cell proliferation compared to those freshly isolated. <b>Saphenous</b> <b>veins</b> cultured at venous pO 2 or internal mammary arteries cultured at arterial pO 2 did not de-velop intimal hyperplasia.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1967, Favaloro began {{to consider the possibility}} of using the <b>saphenous</b> <b>vein</b> in coronary surgery. He put his ideas into practice {{for the first time in}} May of that year. The basic principle was to bypass a diseased (obstructed) segment in a coronary artery in order to deliver blood flow distally. The standardization of this technique, called bypass or transmyocardial revascularization surgery, was the fundamental work of his career, and ensured that his prestige would transcend the limits of his country, as the procedure radically changed the treatment of coronary disease. In 1970 he published one of his best-known volumes, Surgical Treatment of Coronary Arteriosclerosis.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives: to {{evaluate}} the content of lipid peroxidation products (expressed by the concentration of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances; TBARS), the content of myeloperoxidase (MPO), and the localisation of xanthine oxidase (XO) in varicose veins (vv), varicose veins with superficial thrombophlebitis and unchanged <b>saphenous</b> <b>veins.</b> Methods: varicose <b>saphenous</b> <b>veins,</b> varicose veins with superficial thrombophlebitis and normal <b>saphenous</b> <b>veins</b> obtained during varicose vein surgery on 36 patients as well as healthy <b>saphenous</b> <b>veins</b> from cadaver organ donors (control). Homogenates were prepared in which TBARS concentration and MPO content were determined. Immunohistochemical staining to detect XO was also performed. Results: the highest concentration of TBARS occurred in vv with superficial thrombophlebitis, the lowest in donor vein. The highest content of MPO was observed in vv and slightly lower – in varicose veins with thrombophlebitis. A positive reaction for XO was seen in vv wall endothelium. Specimens of vv with thrombophlebitis revealed strong, intense staining in endothelium {{as well as in}} vasa vasorum.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of endovenous laser therapy (EVLT) for treating saphenous reflux associated with varicose veins. DesignOut-patient treatment by EVLT with an 810 nm laser wavelength with results assessed by ultrasound surveillance. Patients 361 patients who received EVLT for 509 incompetent <b>saphenous</b> <b>veins</b> over a five-year period. MethodsEVLT was used for proximal <b>saphenous</b> <b>veins</b> and ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy (UGS) for distal <b>saphenous</b> <b>veins</b> and tributaries. Control of reflux and occlusion or obliteration of the <b>saphenous</b> <b>veins</b> was assessed by serial ultrasound studies. Univariate Kaplan–Meier life table analysis showed cumulative primary and secondary success rates, and multivariate Cox regression analysis assessed covariates that could be associated with increased risk of ultrasound failure. ResultsLife table analysis showed primary success at four years in 76 % (95 % CI 56 – 87 %) and secondary success at four years after further treatment of recurrence by UGS in 97 % (95 % CI 93 – 99 %). Cox regression analysis showed a non-significant trend towards worse primary success in male patients and worse results for older patients and limbs with clinical CEAP categories C 4 – 6. Cox regression showed significantly worse secondary success for limbs with clinical CEAP C 4 – 6. ConclusionsEVLT effectively controls saphenous reflux particularly with ultrasound surveillance to detect early recurrence that can be treated by UGS.

25|$|SEMS {{are also}} {{sometimes}} {{used in the}} vascular system, usually in the aorta and peripheral vascular system. In the past they {{have been used for}} <b>saphenous</b> <b>vein</b> graft and native coronary artery percutaneous coronary interventions.|$|E
25|$|Graft patency is {{dependent}} {{on a number of}} factors, including the type of graft used (internal thoracic artery, radial artery, or great <b>saphenous</b> <b>vein),</b> the size of the coronary artery that the graft is anastomosed with, and, of course, the skill of the surgeon(s) performing the procedure. Arterial grafts (e.g. LITA, radial) are far more sensitive to rough handling than the saphenous veins and may go into spasm if handled improperly.|$|E
25|$|Veins {{that are}} used either have their valves removed or are turned around so that the valves in them do not occlude blood flow in the graft. LITA grafts are longer-lasting than vein grafts, both because the artery is more robust than a vein and because, being already {{connected}} to the arterial tree, the LITA need only be grafted at one end. The LITA is usually grafted to the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) because of its superior long-term patency when compared to <b>saphenous</b> <b>vein</b> grafts.|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{estimate}} medium-term success after {{a technique}} for ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy for superficial chronic venous disease. DesignA prospective study {{in a single}} unit with ultrasound surveillance after treatment. MaterialsResults after 1189 treatment sessions for 807 venous <b>saphenous</b> <b>veins</b> and related tributaries or non-saphenous tributaries in 489 patients. MethodsUnivariate life table analysis determined primary and secondary success rates. Multivariate Cox regression analysis detected covariates that affected outcome. ResultsPrimary and secondary success rates at 36 months for all veins were 52. 4 % (95 %CI 46 – 58 %) and 76. 8 % (95 %CI 71 – 82 %). Cox regression analysis for primary success for all veins showed significantly worse results for <b>saphenous</b> <b>veins</b> compared to tributaries (HR 3. 72 – 95 %CI 1. 9 to 7. 3). Cox regression for all <b>saphenous</b> <b>veins</b> showed independently worse results for patients less than 40 years age (HR 2. 16 – 95 %CI 1. 27 – 3. 66), small compared to great <b>saphenous</b> <b>veins</b> (HR 1. 58 – 95 %CI 1. 11 – 2. 24), veins greater than 6 mm diameter compared to smaller veins (HR 2. 22 – 95 %CI 1. 40 – 3. 50), liquid compared to foam sclerotherapy (HR 2. 20 – 95 %CI 1. 28 – 3. 78), lower volumes of sclerosant compared to volumes greater than 12 ml (HR 0. 51 – 95 %CI 0. 33 – 0. 81) and highly diluted compared to concentrated sclerosant (HR 2. 05 – 95 %CI 1. 21 – 3. 46) with worse results using highly diluted or undiluted 3 % sclerosant compared to a 1. 5 % concentration. There {{were no significant differences}} for primary success for <b>saphenous</b> <b>veins</b> for date of procedure, sex, side, primary or recurrent varicose veins, or commercial type of sclerosant. ConclusionsUltrasound-guided sclerotherapy gives satisfactory results if it is accepted that treatment may need to be repeated to achieve secondary success.

30|$|One subject {{deviated}} {{slightly from}} the described protocol on the following points: (1) catheterization of the great <b>saphenous</b> <b>veins</b> only succeeded unilaterally (intradermal depot); (2) depot activities were approximately 1 MBq/depot.|$|R
25|$|The {{choice of}} vessel(s) is highly {{dependent}} upon the particular surgeon and institution. Typically, the left internal thoracic artery (LITA) (previously referred to as left internal mammary artery or LIMA) is grafted to the left anterior descending artery and a combination of other arteries and veins is used for other coronary arteries. The right internal thoracic artery (RITA), the great <b>saphenous</b> <b>vein</b> from the leg and the radial artery from the forearm are frequently used; in the U.S., these vessels are usually harvested endoscopically, using a technique known as endoscopic vessel harvesting (EVH). The right gastroepiploic artery from the stomach is infrequently used given the difficult mobilization from the abdomen.|$|E
25|$|Coronary artery {{bypass surgery}} {{involves}} an artery or vein {{from the patient}} being implanted to bypass narrowings or occlusions in the coronary arteries. Several arteries and veins can be used, however internal mammary artery grafts have demonstrated significantly better long-term patency rates than great <b>saphenous</b> <b>vein</b> grafts. In patients with two or more coronary arteries affected, bypass surgery is associated with higher long-term survival rates compared to percutaneous interventions. In patients with single vessel disease, surgery is comparably safe and effective, and may be a treatment option in selected cases. Bypass surgery has higher costs initially, but becomes cost-effective in the long term. A surgical bypass graft is more invasive initially but bears less risk of recurrent procedures (but these may be again minimally invasive).|$|E
25|$|Brown and {{co-workers}} {{examined the effects}} of the individual enantiomers of synephrine on α1 receptors in rat aorta, and on α2 receptors in rabbit <b>saphenous</b> <b>vein.</b> In the aorta preparation, l-synephrine gave a pD2 = 5.38 (potency relative to norepinephrine = 1/1000), while d-synephrine had a pD2 = 3.50 (potency relative to norepinephrine = 1/50000); in comparison, l-phenylephrine had pD2 = 7.50 (potency relative to norepinephrine ≃ 1/6). No antagonism of norepinephrine was produced by concentrations of l-synephrine up to 10−6 M. In the rabbit saphenous assay, the pD2 of l-synephrine was 4.36 (potency relative to norepinephrine ≃ 1/1700), and that of d-synephrine was < 3.00; in comparison, l-phenylephrine had pD2 = 5.45 (potency relative to norepinephrine ≃ 1/140).

40|$|Helical {{strips of}} <b>saphenous</b> <b>veins</b> from {{diabetic}} (n = 8) and non-diabetic (n = 18) humans were studied in vivo for their responsiveness to several vasoactive agents. Following application of passive force (˜ 20 · 0 mN), venous strips from non-diabetic humans often developed spontaneous phasic contractile activity (12 out of 18 patients; 2 – 5 contractions/min). These intrinsic changes in force {{were seen in}} venous strips from only one diabetic patient. The phasic contractions were not altered by treatment with phentolamine, whereas the calcium channel blocker, D- 600, and calcium-free solution (1 · 0 mM EGTA) inhibited the phasic contractions. <b>Saphenous</b> <b>veins</b> from diabetic patients developed less maximal, active tension in response to norepinephrine than those from non-diabetic patients. Contractile responses to serotonin, angiotensin II, and elevated potassium concentration in <b>saphenous</b> <b>veins</b> from diabetic patients were not different from those in veins from non-diabetic patients. These observations demonstrate attenuated development of active tension in response to alpha-adrenergic receptor activation and reduced spontaneous contractile activity in venous smooth muscle from diabetic patients...|$|R
500|$|Particular {{veins of}} the DVS and the SVS are looked at. The great <b>saphenous</b> <b>vein</b> (GSV), {{and the small}} <b>saphenous</b> <b>vein</b> (SSV) are {{superficial}} veins which drain into respectively, the common femoral vein and the popliteal vein. These veins are deep veins. Perforator veins drain superficial veins into the deep veins. Three anatomic compartments are described (as networks), (N1) containing the deep veins, (N2) containing the perforator veins, and (N3) [...] containing the superficial veins, known as the saphenous compartment,. This compartmentalisation {{makes it easier for}} the examiner to systematize and map. The GSV can be located in the saphenous compartment where together with the Giacomini vein and the accessory <b>saphenous</b> <b>vein</b> (ASV) [...] an image resembling an eye, known as the 'eye sign' can be seen. The ASV which is often responsible for varicose veins, can be located at the 'alignment sign', where it is seen to align with the femoral vessels. Together with the GSV and the CFV these three veins create an image called the 'Mickey Mouse' sign. The examination report will include details of the deep and the superficial vein systems, and their mapping. The mapping is drawn on paper and then drawn on the patient before surgery.|$|E
500|$|The great saphenous vein,(GSV) a {{superficial}} vein, {{is the longest}} vein in the body. It has its origin in the dorsal venous arch of the foot, {{a superficial}} vein which connects the small <b>saphenous</b> <b>vein</b> with the GSV. It travels up the leg and medial side of the thigh to reach the groin, where it drains into the common femoral vein. Along {{the length of the}} GSV, it receives [...] numerous tributaries, (from the subcutaneous layer) and drains into the deep veins via the perforator veins. When seen in a scan, the GSV and the Giacomini vein, together with the accessory <b>saphenous</b> <b>vein</b> (ASV), form an image resembling an eye which {{is referred to as the}} [...] "eye sign" [...] or [...] "eye image"[...] All veins which are between the skin and the superficial fascia are tributaries and all veins which cross the deep fascia to join the deep venous system are perforator veins.|$|E
500|$|The {{anterior}} ASV is more anterior {{than the}} ASV and {{is outside the}} femoral vessels plan. The two veins terminate in a common trunk near the groin, the sapheno-femoral junction. Here, the ASV can be located [...] aligned with the femoral vessels at the [...] "alignment sign". Also, at the groin {{it can be seen}} at the outside of the great <b>saphenous</b> <b>vein,</b> and together with the common femoral vein (CFV) these three create an image, the so-called [...] "Mickey Mouse sign". Some authors, inspired by this sign (presented {{for the first time at}} CHIVA's 2002 meeting in Berlin), described a [...] "Mickey Mouse view" [...] at the groin, an image formed by the common femoral vein, the GSV and the superficial femoral artery. When the ASV is incompetent, its flow becomes retrograde and tries to drain in the superior fibular perforator, at the side of the knee, or sometimes it runs down towards the ankle to drain in the inferior fibular perforator.|$|E

2500|$|René Favaloro, an Argentine surgeon, {{achieved}} a physiologic {{approach in the}} surgical management of coronary artery disease—the bypass grafting procedure—at the Cleveland Clinic in May 1967. His new technique used a <b>saphenous</b> <b>vein</b> autograft to replace a stenotic segment of the right coronary artery. Later, he successfully used the <b>saphenous</b> <b>vein</b> as a bypassing channel, which has become the typical bypass graft technique we know today; in the U.S., this vessel is typically harvested endoscopically, using a technique known as endoscopic vessel harvesting (EVH).|$|E
2500|$|Generally {{the best}} patency rates are {{achieved}} with the in-situ left {{internal thoracic artery}} (the proximal end is left connected to the subclavian artery) with the distal end being anastomosed with the coronary artery (typically the left anterior descending artery or a diagonal branch artery). Lesser patency rates can be expected with radial artery grafts and [...] "free" [...] internal thoracic artery grafts (where the proximal end of the thoracic artery is excised from its origin from the subclavian artery and re-anastomosed with the ascending aorta). <b>Saphenous</b> <b>vein</b> grafts have worse patency rates, but are more available, as the patients can have multiple segments of the <b>saphenous</b> <b>vein</b> used to bypass different arteries.|$|E
