In both cases the electromagnetic field has a <b>slit-shaped</b> <b>curve</b> as a boundary condition, and the singularities correspond to a shock wave that {{is a consequence of}} the curvature of the slit curve. As prototypes, we generate singularities that correspond to fold and cusped regions. We show that singularities in free space may generate bifurcation effects while plasmon fields do not generate these kinds of effects.

40|$|The {{detonation}} propagation {{phenomena in}} <b>curved</b> <b>channels</b> were experimentally studied {{in order to}} determine the stable propagation condition. A stoichiometric ethylene–oxygen mixture gas and five types of rectangular-cross-section <b>curved</b> <b>channels</b> with different inner radii of curvature were employed. The detonation waves propagating through the <b>curved</b> <b>channels</b> were visualized using a high-speed video camera. Multi-frame short-time open-shutter photography (MSOP) was developed in the present study to simultaneously observe the front shock shape of the detonation wave and the trajectories of triple points on the detonation wave. The detonation wave became more stable under the conditions of a higher filling pressure of the mixture gas and/or a larger inner radius of curvature of the <b>curved</b> <b>channel.</b> The critical condition under which the propagation mode of the detonation wave transitioned from unstable to stable was having an inner radius of curvature of the <b>curved</b> <b>channel</b> (ri) equivalent to 21 – 32 times the normal detonation cell width (λ). In the stable propagation mode, the normal detonation velocity (Dn) increased with the distance from the inner wall of the <b>curved</b> <b>channel</b> and approached the velocity of the planar detonation propagating through the straight section of the <b>curved</b> <b>channel</b> (Dstr). The smallest Dn was observed on the inner wall and decreased with decreasing ri/λ. The distribution of Dn on the detonation wave in the stable mode was approximately formulated. The approximated Dn given by the formula agreed well with the experimental results. The front shock shape of the detonation wave could be reconstructed accurately using the formula. The local curvature of the detonation wave (κ) nondimensionalized by λ decreased with increasing distance from the inner wall. The largest λκ was observed on the inner wall and increased with increasing ri/λ. Dn/Dstr decreased with increasing λκ. This nondimensionalized Dn–κ relation was nearly independent of ri/λ...|$|R

30|$|Figure  1 {{illustrates}} that the gas adsorption of Jurassic low-rank coal increases slowly under low pressure. Conversely as the pressure increases (P/P 0  >  0.5), an adsorption hysteresis loop appears within all samples. The {{appearance of the}} adsorption hysteresis loop mainly depends on the capillary condensation that occurs on the solid surface. The adsorption hysteresis loops of different coal samples vary considerably, indicating different pore structure characteristic effects on gas adsorption (Jiang et al. 2011). According {{to the shape of}} pores, the adsorption hysteresis loop can be divided into four categories (Kondo et al. 2006). As shown in Fig.  1, the adsorption hysteresis loop for Jurassic low-rank coal emerges under pressures of 0.5 – 0.8 and gradually disappears as the pressure increases. This phenomenon confirms that mesopores in low-rank coal samples usually have semi-open inkpot-shapes and macropores are usually <b>slit-shaped.</b> <b>Curves</b> for medium- and high-rank coal samples indicate that the samples contain numerous wedge-shaped and slit-shaped pores, which contribute greatly to gas desorption.|$|R
40|$|The {{propagation}} of curved detonation waves of gaseous explosives stabilized in rectangular-cross-section <b>curved</b> <b>channels</b> is investigated. Three types of stoichiometric test gases, C 2 H 4 + 3 O 2, 2 H 2 + O 2, and 2 C 2 H 2 + 5 O 2 + 7 Ar, are evaluated. The {{ratio of the}} inner radius of the <b>curved</b> <b>channel</b> (ri) to the normal detonation cell width (λ) {{is an important factor}} in stabilizing curved detonation waves. The lower boundary of stabilization is around ri/λ = 23, regardless of the test gas. The stabilized curved detonation waves eventually attain a specific curved shape as they propagate through the <b>curved</b> <b>channels.</b> The specific <b>curved</b> shapes of stabilized curved detonation waves are approximately formulated, and the normal detonation velocity (Dn) −curvature (κ) relations are evaluated. The Dn nondimensionalized by the Chapman–Jouguet (CJ) detonation velocity (DCJ) is a function of the κ nondimensionalized by λ. The Dn/DCJ−λκ relation does not depend on the type of test gas. The propagation behavior of the stabilized curved detonation waves is controlled by the Dn/DCJ−λκ relation. Due to this propagation characteristic, the fully-developed, stabilized curved detonation waves propagate through the <b>curved</b> <b>channels</b> while maintaining a specific curved shape with a constant angular velocity. Self-similarity is seen in the front shock shapes of the stabilized curved detonation waves with the same ri/λ, regardless of the <b>curved</b> <b>channel</b> and test gas...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{studied the}} effect of {{geometry}} on single focusing of particles in the passive microfluidic channels. There is a quantitative analysis of focusing on non-axisymmetric straight channels with two different unique designs as well as <b>curved</b> <b>channels</b> having symmetrical and asymmetrical radius of curvatures in one turn. We found {{that there is a}} clear relationship in existence of single line focusing with the degree of non-symmetry in microchannels. One-degree of asymmetry in straight channels does not induce any formation of single focusing, but single line focusing is pronounced by two-degree of asymmetry in straight channels. On the other hand, single line focusing in the <b>curved</b> <b>channels</b> is enhanced with asymmetrical radius of curvatures in one turn. The single line focusing in <b>curved</b> <b>channels</b> is seen at Rep values higher than 1, which gives us better continuous and high-throughput performance. The position of single focused particles in the microchannels is found to be 50 µm with respect to the channel wall in the asymmetrical curved microchannels...|$|R

The two aspects which are compared to each other in this project are related to velocity and depth of water in the channel. Computational Fluid Dynamics is used to model the flow in downstream of the dam and in the <b>curved</b> <b>channel</b> which is exactly located after the bottom outlet. The full Navier- Stokes equations are solved under steady conditions with the commercial software ANSYS CFX 12. 1.

40|$|A 3 D {{non-isotropic}} algebraic stress/flux turbulence {{model is}} employed to simulate turbulent buoyant helicoidal flow and heat transfer in a rectangular <b>curved</b> open <b>channel.</b> The prediction shows that, unlike the isothermal flow, {{there are two}} major and one minor secondary flow eddies in a cross section of thermally stratified turbulent buoyant helicoidal flow in a <b>curved</b> open <b>channel.</b> The results compare favorably with available experimental data. The thermocline in a <b>curved</b> <b>channel</b> is thicker than that in a straight channel. All of these is the result of complex interaction between the buoyant force, the centrifugal force and the Reynolds stresses. The turbulent flow in a <b>curved</b> <b>channel</b> is obviously non-isotropic: The turbulence fluctuations in vertical and radial directions are lower in magnitude than that in the axial direction, which illustrates the suppression of turbulence due to buoyant and centrifugal forces.

40|$|We {{study the}} motion of large bubbles in <b>curved</b> <b>channels</b> both semi-analytically using the {{lubrication}} approximation and computationally using a finite-volume/front-tracking method. The steady film thickness is governed by the classical Landau– Levich–Derjaguin–Bretherton (LLDB) equation in the low-capillary-number limit but with the boundary conditions modified {{to account for the}} channel curvature. The lubrication results show that the film is thinner on the inside of a bend than on the outside of a bend. They also indicate that the bubble velocity relative to the average liquid velocity is always larger in a <b>curved</b> <b>channel</b> than that in a corresponding straight channel and increases monotonically with increasing channel curvature. Numerical computations are performed for two-dimensional cases and the computational results are found to be in a good agreement with the lubrication theory for small capillary numbers and small or moderate channel curvatures. For moderate capillary numbers the numerical results for the film thickness, when rescaled to account for channel curvature as suggested in the lubrication calculation, essentially collapse onto the corresponding results for a bubble in a straight tube.

Three different designs of a <b>curved</b> <b>channel</b> micromixer are introduced to evaluate the mixing performance of the designed micromixer. Mixing performances are demonstrated by means of a pH indicator using an optical microscope and fluorescent particles via a confocal microscope at different flow rates corresponding to Reynolds numbers (Re) ranging from 0. 5 to 50.

First reported in 1961, this Segre-Silberberg effect is particularly useful for microfluidic isolation of cells and particles.
