40|$|International audienceDuring the {{explosion}} of an organic dust cloud, the following steps are usually encountered: particle heating; its devolatilization/pyrolysis; and, then, a homogeneous combustion of the pyrolysis gases. In order to highlight {{the influence of the}} pyrolysis step in such explosions, experiments have been carried out on wheat <b>starch</b> <b>powders</b> and their pyrolysis gases. The maximum rate of pressure rise of the gases reaches 2830 bar s(- 1) whereas it remains lower than 400 bar s(- 1) for the starch at the same fuel equivalence ratio.

40|$|Different {{combinations}} of hydrophilic (glycerol and water) and amphiphilic (isoleucine) plasticizers were {{studied in the}} production of thermoplastic <b>starch</b> (TPS) <b>powders</b> and films from oxidized potato <b>starch.</b> All <b>powder</b> samples had an irregular and shrivelled morphology. In all mixtures containing isoleucine, this additive exuded from the starch matrix and re-crystallized during spray drying, resulting in hollow particles. The crystallinity and moisture sensitivity of freshly prepared films depended on the isoleucine content in the plasticizer formulation. Increasing the content led to a decrease in moisture absorption. Isoleucine formulated films showed the best tensile strength, whereas glycerol-rich ones showed better strain at break values. All glycerol plasticized formulations and the spray dried non-modified starch were amorphous. Glycerol reduced the glass transition temperature to 128 degrees C and glycerol formulated films showed the highest moisture uptake due to its hydrophilic nature. At a relative humidity (RH) of 50 %, the rate of retrogradation was low, but at RH 100 % all TPS films showed a high rate of retrogradation...|$|R

Critical values of this vibration number and the fluidization velocity, beyond which the powders would fluidize well, were determined under the conditions investigated.

40|$|The <b>starch</b> <b>powdered</b> {{samples were}} {{analyzed}} for their pasting characteristics using Rapid visco analyser (RVA). From {{the graph of}} viscosity versus time, the final viscosity of plantain starch (298. 67 Rvu) was {{higher than that of}} Banana starch (165. 67 Rvu). The higher viscosity recorded in plantain starch showed that there was re-association between the starch molecules which led to formation of gel and caused by not only simple kinetic effect of cooling but re-association of amylose. The hold period of plantain starch (141. 75 minutes) was higher than that of Banana starch (112. 33 minutes). The hold period is accomplished by a breakdown in viscosity. The breakdown of banana starch (29. 42 Rvu) was higher than that of protein (24. 25 Rvu). The high breakdown in viscosity of Banana starch will be of great usefulness industrially. The peak viscosity of plantain (116. 00 Rvu) was higher than that of Banana starch (141. 75 Rvu).

50|$|A {{measured}} {{amount of}} dry rice is placed within the bowl. For long-grain rice or scented rice (e.g., basmati rice, Thai jasmine rice), neither washing or soaking is usually necessary unless contaminating dirt is suspected.

For washing, a generous {{amount of water}} {{is added to the}} rice then the mixture is stirred a few times with a hand quickly.

Excessive washing, however, is believed to be detrimental, since it will remove too many water-soluble nutrients, e.g., vitamins.|$|E
50|$|Pregelatinized starch may {{be added}} to {{increase}} the rate of starch gelatinization. One method of pregelatinization starts by heating a mixture of starch and water until a gel forms. The gel may be placed on a heated roll in a thin layer in order to dry it. Once all the water has been removed, a starch cake is left on the roll. The cake is then scraped off and pulverized to form a powder. When the pregelatinized <b>starch</b> <b>powder</b> is subjected to water, a gel forms. The pregelatinized starch increases water adsorption. This in turn increases the batter viscosity and helps retain the entrapped air while the batter is prepared and as it starts to bake. The gel is not as strong has {{it would be if}} a normal starch was mixed with water and heated. However, the combination of pregelatinized starch and starch in the wheat flour create an acceptable gel together. Typically corn starch is used, however a variety of other starches also work.|$|E

The heating rate {{did not affect the}} measurements in the range tested (0. 25 to 1 C min 1). An interactive effect of the strain amplitude and the frequency was detected. The significance of this interaction can be caused by differences in mechanical energy dissipation, which would indicate that not only temperature but also the total energy input may affect this transition. Slight effects of phase separation between gluten and starch were found on native flour...|$|R
