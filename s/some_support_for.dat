5|$|Perhaps the {{greatest}} controversy of Sanford's presidency was {{his effort to}} establish the presidential library of former US President Richard Nixon at Duke. Sanford raised the subject with Nixon {{during a visit to}} the former president at Nixon's New York City office on July 28, 1981. Sanford continued to seek Nixon's advice on multiple issues within the months that followed. The library proposal became public in mid-August, creating considerable controversy at the university. Though Sanford enjoyed <b>some</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> his effort, most of the faculty were against the proposal, the largest concern being that the facility would be a monument to Nixon rather than a center of study. Sanford tried to engineer a compromise, but the proposal by the Duke Academic Council of a library only a third the size of that which Nixon wanted and their rejection of a Nixon museum to accompany it, ultimately led Nixon to decline Sanford's offer and site his library in the city of his birth, Yorba Linda, California, instead; it was dedicated there in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Sputnik 2 was not {{designed}} to be retrievable, and Laika had always been intended to die. The mission sparked a debate across the globe on the mistreatment of animals and animal testing in general to advance science. In the United Kingdom, the National Canine Defence League called on all dog owners to observe a minute's silence, while the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) received protests even before Radio Moscow had finished announcing the launch. Animal rights groups at the time called on {{members of the public}} to protest at Soviet embassies. Others demonstrated outside the United Nations in New York; nevertheless, laboratory researchers in the U.S. offered <b>some</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the Soviets, at least before the news of Laika's death.|$|E
5|$|Voss and Carleton {{had found}} <b>some</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> a close {{relationship}} between Holochilus, Lundomys, and Pseudoryzomys within Oryzomyini. In subsequent years, the related species Holochilus primigenus and Noronhomys vespuccii were discovered, providing additional evidence for this grouping. The allocation of the former, {{which is similar to}} Lundomys in features of the dentition, to Holochilus is controversial, and placement as a second species of Lundomys has been suggested as an alternative. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of oryzomyines by Marcelo Weksler, published in 2006, supported {{a close relationship}} among Lundomys, Holochilus, and Pseudoryzomys; the other species of the group were not included. Data from the sequence of the IRBP gene supported a closer relationship between Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys, with Lundomys more distantly related, but morphological data placed Holochilus and Lundomys closer together, as did the combined analysis of both morphological and IRPB data. Subsequently, Carletonomys cailoi was described as an additional relative of Holochilus and Lundomys.|$|E

5|$|According to sinologists Denis C. Twitchett and Klaus-Peter Tietze, it is {{generally}} held that the Khitans emerged from the Yuwen branch of the Xianbei people. Following a defeat {{at the hands of}} another branch of the Xianbei in 345, the Yuwen split into three tribes, one of which was called the Kumo Xi. In 388 the Kumo Xi itself split, with one group remaining under the name Kumo Xi and the other group becoming the Khitans. This view is partially backed up by the Book of Wei, which describes the Khitans as being of Xianbei origins. There are also several competing theories on the origin of the Khitans. Beginning in the Song dynasty, some Chinese scholars suggested that the Khitans might have descended from the Xiongnu people. While modern historians have rejected the idea that the Khitan were solely Xiongnu in origin, there is <b>some</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the claim that they are of mixed Xianbei and Xiongnu origin. Beginning with Rashid-al-Din Hamadani in the fourteenth century, several Western scholars have theorized that the Khitans were Mongolic in origin, and in the late 19th century Western scholars made the claim that the Khitans were Tungusic in origin—modern linguistic analysis has discredited this claim.|$|E

He reportedly refused to participate in ceremonies involving Mussolini, and condemned racist legislation during the Fascist period.|$|E

25|$|The VII Army Corps of the Regio Esercito {{was able}} to occupy Corsica, which was still under the formal {{sovereignty}} of Vichy France, without a fight. Because of the initial lack of perceived partisan resistance and to avoid problems with Marshal Philippe Pétain, no Corsican units were formed under Italian control (except for a labour battalion in March 1943). The Corsican population initially showed <b>some</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the Italians, partly {{as a consequence of}} irredentist propaganda.|$|E

This is considered by its advocates to emphasise relationships over abstract principles and therefore to reflect the caring relationship in nursing more accurately than other ethical views. Themes that emphasize the dignity of the patient by promoting a respectful and caring attitude from nurses are also commonly seen.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{quantify}} traffic congestion impacts, {{we found a}} way to evaluate the service level of transportation system. It is a hotspot to study traffic congestion relieving policies in China. Most of these studies focus on seeking sources of congestion and qualitative analysis of policies to relieve congestion. However, study on quantitative indicators for congestion impacts is as important as study on congestion-estimating policies. Study of traffic congestion impacts on travelers and their reactions can provide <b>some</b> <b>supports</b> <b>for</b> setting the target of urban transportation system service level, also for choosing congestion policies.|$|R

25|$|As a contemporary, {{and one of}} {{the chief}} kings in Scotland, Bridei appears in Adomnán's Life of Saint Columba. Adomnán's account of Bridei is {{problematic}} in that it fails to tells us whether Bridei was already a Christian, and if not, whether Columba converted him. The recent archaeological discoveries at Portmahomack, showing that there was a monastic community perhaps as early as the late 6th century, may provide <b>some</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the idea that Bridei was either already a Christian, at least in name, or was converted by Columba.|$|E
25|$|Mustafa Kemal (Atatürk) sent several {{delegations}} to Moscow in {{an attempt}} to win <b>some</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> his own post-Ottoman movement in what he saw as a modernised ethno-nationalist Turkey. This alliance proved disastrous for the Armenians. The signing of the Ottoman-Russian friendship treaty (1 January 1918), helped Vehib Pasha to attack the new Republic. Under heavy pressure from the combined forces of the Ottoman army and the Kurdish irregulars, the Republic was forced to withdraw from Erzincan to Erzurum. In the end, the Republic had to evacuate Erzurum as well.|$|E
25|$|Hilbert and Pólya {{suggested}} {{that one way}} to derive the Riemann hypothesis would be to find a self-adjoint operator, from the existence of which the statement on the real parts of the zeros of ζ(s) would follow when one applies the criterion on real eigenvalues. <b>Some</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> this idea comes from several analogues of the Riemann zeta functions whose zeros correspond to eigenvalues of some operator: the zeros of a zeta function of a variety over a finite field correspond to eigenvalues of a Frobenius element on an étale cohomology group, the zeros of a Selberg zeta function are eigenvalues of a Laplacian operator of a Riemann surface, and the zeros of a p-adic zeta function correspond to eigenvectors of a Galois action on ideal class groups.|$|E
