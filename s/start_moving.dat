5|$|Water pipits {{leave their}} {{breeding}} sites from mid-September, although the eastern subspecies may <b>start</b> <b>moving</b> south before then. The spring migration starts in February and March, with arrival on the breeding grounds in April and May. The water pipit {{has been recorded}} as a vagrant in Belarus, Gibraltar and Latvia, and on islands including the Canaries, Iceland, Malta and Svalbard.|$|E
5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{are incorporated into}} eruption columns as they are ejected from the vent at high velocity. The initial momentum from the eruption propels the column upwards. As air is drawn into the column, the bulk density decreases and it starts to rise buoyantly into the atmosphere. At {{a point where the}} bulk density of the column {{is the same as the}} surrounding atmosphere, the column will cease rising and <b>start</b> <b>moving</b> laterally. Lateral dispersion is controlled by prevailing winds and the ash may be deposited hundreds to thousands of kilometres from the volcano, depending on eruption column height, particle size of the ash and climatic conditions (especially wind direction and strength and humidity).|$|E

5|$|In the end, the Russian {{declaration}} of war {{came as a surprise}} to both Carol and Kogălniceanu, who had not been informed of the exact date (April 23) when the Imperial Russian Army would <b>start</b> <b>moving</b> into Moldavia—hence, Romanians tended to regard it as an invasion. Also alarming for Kogălniceanu, the official Russian proclamation addressed Romanians as protegés of the Empire. Bilateral tensions were somewhat alleviated by Russian apologies and, later, by the Ottoman pledge to annex Romania; addressing a discontented Parliament, Kogălniceanu asserted that the Russian road was the country's only choice.|$|E
5|$|The player gains {{points by}} {{defeating}} multiple enemies consecutively and {{can participate in}} a bonus round to gain more points. Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been flipped on their back. This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this, the enemy will flip itself back over, changing in color and increasing speed. Each phase has {{a certain number of}} enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing to maximum speed. Hitting a flipped enemy from underneath causes it to right itself and <b>start</b> <b>moving</b> again, but it does not change speed or color.|$|E
5|$|When diving, {{this bird}} pulls its {{head back and}} then arches it forward into the water, with the body {{following}} and a slight springing. The legs only <b>start</b> <b>moving</b> when they are underwater. When swimming {{on the surface of}} the water, the body of this grebe is relatively high, although none of the underparts are seen. The neck is held straight up in a relaxed manner, with the bill being held forward and parallel to the water. Each of the feet perform strong alternating strokes.|$|E

5|$|Gestation lasts {{nearly two}} to three months, {{following}} which a litter consisting of one to six kittens is born. Births generally peak from October to February. Births take place in dense vegetation or deserted burrows of aardvark and porcupines. Kittens are born with their eyes and ears shut and the claws non-retractable (unable to be drawn inside); the coat resembles that of adults, but the abdomen is spotted. Eyes open by ten days, but it takes longer for the vision to become normal. The ears become erect and the claws become retractable by the third or the fourth week. Around {{the same time the}} kittens start roaming their birthplace, and start playing among themselves by the fifth or the sixth week. They begin taking solid food around the same time; they have to wait for nearly three months before they make their first kill. As the kittens <b>start</b> <b>moving</b> about by themselves, the mother starts shifting them everyday. All the milk teeth appear in 50 days, and permanent dentition is completed in 10 months. Juveniles begin dispersing at nine to ten months, though a few females stay back with their mothers. The average lifespan of the caracal in captivity is nearly 16 years.|$|E
5|$|Heidfeld lost {{hydraulic}} {{pressure on the}} grid; he was required to use the spare Sauber monocoque and start from the pit lane. Fisichella did the same {{because he had a}} fuel leak in his car. When the race started, Montoya maintained his pole position advantage going into the first corner, with Barrichello in second and Michael Schumacher in third. Ralf Schumacher passed Michael Schumacher at the Variante Goodyear chicane but Michael challenged Ralf for the position at the exit of Variante della Roggia and got ahead heading into the Curve di Lesmo. Further back, Trulli was hit by Button and was sent into a spin and became the first retirement of the race. Button made a pit stop {{at the end of the}} lap for a replacement front wing. Irvine made a good start, rising from thirteenth to seventh by the end of the first lap, while Häkkinen made a poor gateway after going through the chicane to avoid making contact with other drivers and fell to thirteenth. Verstappen made the best <b>start,</b> <b>moving</b> from nineteenth to eighth. At the end of the first lap, Montoya led by half a second from Barrichello, who in turn was followed by Michael Schumacher, Ralf Schumacher, Coulthard, de la Rosa, Irvine, Verstappen, Räikkönen, Alesi, Villeneuve, Bernoldi, Häkkinen, Panis, Frentzen, Alonso, Enge, Heidfeld, Yoong, Fisichella and Button.|$|E
5|$|On {{his way to}} the {{starting}} grid, Carlos Sainz Jr. stopped on track and had to be pushed back to pit lane, where he eventually started, only to retire after just a few hundred metres. At the start, both Mercedes drivers got away well and Hamilton tried to overtake Rosberg for the lead around the outside of the first corner, but were unable to do so. Jenson Button made a good <b>start,</b> <b>moving</b> from 16th to 13th, while Marcus Ericsson fell from 13th to 18th. Behind the leaders, the Ferrari drivers retained third and fourth place respectively. Bottas moved into fifth after moving around the outside. Hamilton was able to follow Rosberg closely in the opening laps, while Daniel Ricciardo was the first driver to pit for new tyres on lap four. One lap later, Grosjean was able to use drag reduction system (DRS) to overtake Felipe Nasr for eleventh. With his back row start and an early pit stop, Ricciardo overtook the two Manor Marussia cars around lap nine.|$|E

5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} is a partial migrant: birds {{from the north}} and east of the range {{wintering}} in the milder areas of Europe and North Africa. Scandinavian and Russian birds <b>start</b> <b>moving</b> south from mid-September onwards, most birds wintering in Europe, western Turkey and the Middle East. Between mid-October and November, large numbers cross the Strait of Gibraltar and others pass through Cyprus, but there is hardly any migration across the North Sea. Breeding birds in the British Isles and north-west Europe are resident or move only short distances. In the Himalayas, the breeding population moves to nearby lower-altitude sites in winter. Return migration starts mainly from late March, although it can be a month earlier in the Middle East, and northern breeders may not arrive back on their territories until late April or early May. Migration may be by day or night, and typically involves individuals or small groups. Vagrant birds have occurred in the Azores, China, Crete, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Japan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Sikkim and the United Arab Emirates.|$|E

However, if the snow has sintered into a stiff slab overlying a weak layer then fractures can propagate very rapidly, so that a large volume of snow, that may be thousands of cubic meters, can <b>start</b> <b>moving</b> almost simultaneously.|$|E

The Wedgwood and Haganah closed in on the shore, and at 12:30 opened fire on the Egyptian ship {{from a range of}} about 5,000 yards. The Wedgwood stayed closer to the shore, with the Haganah further at sea. At 12:38, the Egyptian corvette fired back, but missed. The Israeli ships hit and damaged it, which caused the corvette to <b>start</b> <b>moving</b> south.|$|E
25|$|Stephen Hawking {{had shown}} earlier {{that the total}} horizon area of a {{collection}} of black holes always increases with time. The horizon is a boundary defined by light-like geodesics; it is those light rays that are just barely unable to escape. If neighboring geodesics <b>start</b> <b>moving</b> toward each other they eventually collide, at which point their extension is inside the black hole. So the geodesics are always moving apart, and the number of geodesics which generate the boundary, the area of the horizon, always increases. Hawking's result was called the second law of black hole thermodynamics, by analogy with the law of entropy increase, but at first, he did not take the analogy too seriously.|$|E

25|$|Vettel {{made a good}} <b>start,</b> <b>moving</b> up to fifth {{by the end of}} {{the first}} lap but his {{teammate}} Ricciardo was forced wide onto the chicane's run-off area, dropping four positions over the same distance. Massa attempted to take over second place from Magnussen by braking later than he did at the start of lap two while Rosberg pulled away from the two drivers. Magnssen went wide at Curva Grande corner and fended off another overtaking manoeuvre from Massa. DRS was enabled on the next lap and Hamilton used it to attack Massa, allowing Magnussen to pull away from the Williams car. After starting 21st, Kvyat passed both Marussia drivers and Kobayashi to run in 17th. Magnussen continued to defend but in doing so he ran deep entering the Rettifilo chicane, causing Massa to slipstream the McLaren driving towards the Variante della Roggia chicane and overtook him around the outside to claim second. Magnussen entered the turn off the racing line, spun his tyres leaving the corner, enabling Hamilton to gain the advantage by accelerating faster than Magnussen and passed him for third going into the first Lesmo corner. Massa and Hamilton pulled away from Magnussen who was being caught by a group of cars compromising of Vettel, Button, Alonso and Pérez.|$|E
25|$|Kittens {{are born}} blind and helpless, and {{are covered in}} a fuzzy coat. At birth, the kittens weigh 65-163grams, though kittens under 90grams usually do not survive. They are born with pink paw pads, which blacken {{at the age of}} three months, and blue eyes, which turn amber after five months. Their eyes open after 9–12 days, and their incisors erupt after 14–30 days. The kittens' milk teeth are {{replaced}} by their permanent dentition at the age of 160–240 days. The kittens start hunting with their mother at the age of 60 days, and will <b>start</b> <b>moving</b> independently after 140–150 days. Lactation lasts 3–4 months, though the kittens will eat meat as early as 1.5 months of age. Sexual maturity is attained at the age of 300 days. Similarly to the housecat, the physical development of African wildcat kittens over {{the first two weeks of}} their lives is much faster than that of European wildcats. The kittens are largely fully grown by 10 months, though skeletal growth continues for over 18–19 months. The family dissolves after roughly five months, and the kittens disperse to establish their own territories. The species' maximum life span is 21 years, though it usually only lives up to 13–14 years.|$|E
25|$|The race {{began at}} 15:30 local time. The damage to Ye's {{car from the}} {{qualification}} race {{was so great that}} he was unable to start the main event. Ilott's right-rear tyre was changed after he reported vibrations on his warm-up lap. As the five red lights went out to signal the start of the race, Ilott made a fast start and moved in front of Félix da Costa. However, neither driver took the lead, as Sette Cãmara used the slipstream to his advantage and gained the lead going through Mandarin corner and defended the position heading into the inside of Lisboa corner as other drivers attempted to brake later than him. Félix da Costa managed to claim second position from Ilott with the British driver falling to fifth after being passed by Yamashita and Rosenqvist. Rosenqvist made a good <b>start</b> <b>moving</b> from sixth to fourth {{by the end of the}} first lap. At the end of the first lap, Sette Cãmara led Félix da Costa by 1.2 seconds which he extended by two-tenths of a second at the conclusion of the following lap. Rosenqvist attacked Yamashita on lap two but could not overtake the Japanese driver. Yamashita lost third place on the third lap when he was overtaken by Rosenqvist going into Lisboa corner which allowed Ilott to move to the inside lane and take fourth place from the Japanese driver at San Francisco Bend turn despite minor contact between the two drivers.|$|E
