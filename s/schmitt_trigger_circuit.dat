50|$|Digital {{electronic}} circuits are sometimes designed {{to benefit from}} positive feedback. Normal logic gates usually rely simply on gain to push digital signal voltages away from intermediate values to the values that are meant to represent boolean '0' and '1'. When an input voltage is expected to vary in an analogue way, but sharp thresholds are required for later digital processing, the <b>Schmitt</b> <b>trigger</b> <b>circuit</b> uses positive feedback to ensure that if the input voltage creeps gently above the threshold, the output is forced smartly and rapidly from one logic state to the other. One of the corollaries of the Schmitt trigger's use of positive feedback is that, should the input voltage move gently down again past the same threshold, the positive feedback will hold the output in the same state with no change. This effect is called hysteresis: the input voltage has to drop past a different, lower threshold to 'un-latch' the output and reset it to its original digital value. By reducing {{the extent of the}} positive feedback, the hysteresis-width can be reduced, but it can not entirely be eradicated. The Schmitt trigger is, to some extent, a latching circuit.|$|E

For example, it is used in the human body for the regulation of the cell cycle, and in electronics, it is used to engineer <b>Schmitt</b> <b>trigger</b> <b>circuits.</b> Bistable systems possess a mechanism that allows them to switch between two stable states when an energy threshold is exceeded. Recent work demonstrates that coupled bistable systems may be designed to exploit coupling-induced oscillations to obtain some desirable property. The generic properties of coupled bistable systems are investigated via case studies of a Coupled Core Fluxgate Magnetometer and a Nonlinear Channelizer. With the stable manifold theorem and suitable numerical methods, the basins of attraction and their evolution upon changes of parameters are studied in the undriven case. It is shown theoretically that an N-element coupled bistable array driven by a periodic signal with frequency f may produce a traveling wave pattern if the frequency of the array of oscillators is f/(kN), where k is an integer. Computational work confirms this theoretical finding, and many frequency-locking regions of large size are found. An algorithm is described for the demodulation of phase-modulated signals by a coupled bistable system, and the performance of the algorithm is studied in the presence of device noise. The effects of a constant coupling time delay are also investigated computationally for coupled bistable arrays. Overall, coupled bistable systems are shown to exhibit many generic properties that may be exploited for the design of novel future technologies...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents and}} discusses new design techniques for mixed analog-digital circuits with emphases on low power and small area for standard low-cost CMOS VLSI technology. The application {{domain of the}} devised techniques is radio frequency identification (RFID) systems, however the presented techniques are applicable to wide range of mixed mode analog-digital applications. Hence the techniques herein apply {{to a range of}} smart wireless or mobile systems. The integration of both analog and digital circuits on a single substrate has many benefits such as reducing the system power, increasing the system reliability, reducing the system size and providing high inter-system communications speed - hence, a cost effective system implementation with increased performance. On the other hand, some difficulties arise from the fact that standard low-cost CMOS technologies are tuned toward maximising digital circuit performance and increasing transistor density per unit area. Usually these technologies have a wide spread in transistor parameters that require new design techniques that provide circuit characteristics based on relative transistor parameters rather than on the absolute value of these parameters. This research has identified new design techniques for mostly analog and some digital circuits for implementation in standard CMOS technologies with design parameters dependent on the relative values of process parameters, resulting in technology independent circuit design techniques.
