50|$|The term flail {{refers to}} two {{different}} weapons: a long, two-handed infantry weapon with a cylindrical head, and a shorter weapon {{with a round}} metal <b>striking</b> <b>head.</b> The defining characteristic of both is that they involve a separate <b>striking</b> <b>head</b> attached to a handle by a flexible rope, strap, or chain. The chief tactical virtue of the flail was its capacity to strike around a defender's shield or parry. Its chief liability {{was a lack of}} precision and the difficulty of using it in close combat, or closely ranked formations.|$|E

50|$|One of the {{problems}} with a <b>striking</b> <b>head</b> that is significantly narrower than the diameter of the ball is that the ball is easily lifted unintentionally if struck with the face of the stick head inclined backward, 'open', rather than vertical or nearly so. Striking the ball with a 'closed' face is not always a solution, because it is then possible to 'squeeze' or 'clip' it, again causing the ball to rise, possibly even more steeply than with the so-called 'undercut' hit.|$|E

50|$|The white {{cockatoo}} (Cacatua alba), {{also known as}} the umbrella cockatoo, is a medium-sized all-{{white cockatoo}} endemic to tropical rainforest on islands of Indonesia.

The undersides of the wings and tail have a pale yellow or lemon color which flashes when they fly.

50|$|A {{traditional}} hand-held hammer {{consists of}} a separate head and a handle, fastened together {{by means of a}} special wedge made for the purpose, or by glue, or both. This two-piece design is often used, to combine a dense metallic <b>striking</b> <b>head</b> with a non-metallic mechanical-shock-absorbing handle (to reduce user fatigue from repeated strikes). If wood is used for the handle, it is often hickory or ash, which are tough and long-lasting materials that can dissipate shock waves from the hammer head. Rigid fiberglass resin may be used for the handle; this material does not absorb water or decay, but does not dissipate shock as well as wood.|$|E

That's what I'm gathering. There are some really wonderful reasons for that. Like any tough cookie she's tough because she's really fragile, and she's really fragile because she has an Achille's heel." [...] The strike ended a month after Brown started, and in December 2008 she acknowledged that the change in writers due to the strike had made Claudia [...] "inconsistent" [...] in that [...] "half the things the writers had set up for me ultimately were changed ... you've made choices that don't work anymore and you're suddenly saying things that contradict what you did earlier." ...|$|E
