5|$|In 1975, {{the first}} year of pipelaying, Alyeska <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> of {{completing}} 45 percent of the 800-mile route. This would not be laid in a straight line, since it was expected that river crossings would take longer to complete than portions of the pipeline on dry land. Work on the pumping stations and the Valdez Marine Terminal, which had begun in the fall of 1974, also was expected to take longer than laying pipe. Conversely, work on those two projects could proceed during the winter, when pipelaying could not take place due to the frozen ground.|$|E

50|$|To be most {{effective}} goals should be tangible, specific, realistic and have a time targeted for completion. There must be realistic plans to achieve the intended <b>goal.</b> For example, <b>setting</b> <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> to go to Mars on a shoe string budget is not <b>a</b> realistic <b>goal</b> while <b>setting</b> <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> to go to Hawaii as a backpacker is <b>a</b> possible <b>goal</b> with possible, realistic plans. Setting unrealistic goals can be very harmful, especially to teenagers, because if <b>a</b> <b>goal</b> is not achieved it may lower one's self-esteem. Over time this setting of unrealistic goals can lead to depression and, in extreme cases, suicide.|$|R
