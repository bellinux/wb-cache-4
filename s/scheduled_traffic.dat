5|$|Bringelandsåsen was {{proposed}} by the CAA in 1974. Plans were developed and in 1983 the Ministry of Transport and Communications recommended that Øyrane be closed and replaced with an all-new airport at Bringeland. Construction started in 1985 and the new airport opened on 31 August 1986, taking over all <b>scheduled</b> <b>traffic</b> from Øyrane. Widerøe started scheduled services to Oslo and Bergen, originally using de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter and DHC-7 Dash 7 aircraft, of which the latter which was used to Oslo.|$|E

After a one-year trial, they were put into <b>scheduled</b> <b>traffic</b> to the Kolsås Line, where they remained in regular service until 1983. The production series is somewhat different in design and performance. T1000 is both {{used to refer to}} the class as a whole, or the first 162 cars, that are only equipped with third-rail shoes. They have four slight variations, which have been given the designations T1–T4. The T1300 is a series of 33 new and sixteen rebuilt T4 trains equipped with pantographs which previously allowed them operate on {{the western part of the}} network, prior to it being upgraded to third-rail metro standards. The newer units were designated T5 and T6, while the rebuilt units were designated T7 and T8.|$|E
5|$|A hangar {{was built}} at Bergen Airport in 2003, {{and at the}} same time the airline was {{certified}} as a mechanical aviation workshop. The following year, the Cessna 421 was replaced with a Cessna 441 Conquest II. In 2006, two Beechcraft King Air were bought, and the last Cessna sold. On 20 November 2003, Notodden Airport was closed for all <b>scheduled</b> <b>traffic</b> by the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority, due to a lack of safety requirements. Bergen Air Transport was forced to reroute all its aircraft to Skien Airport, Geiteryggen. Following an investment of NOK 500,000 from the airline and NOK 1.2 million from the municipality, which owns the airport, scheduled services commenced again. From 1 October 2004, NOK 250,000 was invested at Notodden Airport. Starting in October 2004, the airline also introduced security control of all passengers at Notodden Airport. In 2005, the company had a revenue of NOK 10.3 million; this increased to NOK 20.1 million in 2006, giving a profit of NOK 2.8 million, when the airline transported 2,841 passengers.|$|E

25|$|At first Framnes {{only served}} general aviation, but in late 1974 Parliament {{approved}} that the airport {{be used for}} subsidized regional aviation. The airport started with <b>scheduled</b> <b>traffic</b> on 1 October 1975. The original terminal building was a residential house which {{had been in the}} way for the runway and moved to a suitable location. Initial services were provided by Widerøe using a 19-passenger de Havilland Canada Twin Otter with flights provided to Bodø Airport; Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes; Svolvær Airport, Helle and Stokmarknes Airport, Skagen. The airport handled 19,135 passengers in 1985.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} half of 1984 the airline {{developed}} plans to start <b>scheduled</b> <b>traffic,</b> and applied for concession to operate out of Sandefjord Airport, Torp to Gothenburg and Copenhagen. They also applied to operate a route from Oslo via Notodden Airport, Tuven to Stavanger. The Notodden concession was granted in March 1985, and the route was started on 15 August using Super King Air and flew twice a day, five days a week. This route was made possible after an instrument landing system was installed at the airport. The upgrades also included a new terminal. Ticket sales and check-in was managed by NSB Reisebyrå, a subsidiary of the Norwegian State Railways.|$|E

He had faith in that the area was superb for tourism and stated to Telemark Arbeiderblad on 16 September 1967 that he would give the airline to the {{municipality}} it Fyresdal did not have continental traffic within two years. The airport opened on 23 September. Fjellfly established a pilot school at Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik the same year. With the upgrading of Geiteryggen to a longer, asphalt runway, the airline started looking for a more economical aircraft. In 1969, Fjellfly bought a de Havilland Heron from Tokyo and flew it back, arriving in February 1970. After a simple renovation, which included a renewal of the interior, the aircraft was put into service in the <b>scheduled</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E

25|$|Compared {{with a year}} earlier, September 2017 {{passenger}} numbers {{increased by}} 2.7% to 4.464million (an increase of 117,900 over September 2016). The following changes were recorded amongst individual passenger traffic categories: North Atlantic traffic +11.9% (330,800 passengers); other long-haul traffic +4.4% (312,800 passengers); UK traffic +3.5% (352,100 passengers); European <b>scheduled</b> <b>traffic</b> +1.9% (3.065million passengers); Irish traffic +0.2% (131,600 passengers); European charter traffic +0.1% (271,300 passengers). Air transport movements increased by 0.8% to 27,220. Cargo volume increased by 27.3% to 8,409 metric tonnes. Key to continuing growth in passenger traffic was the increase in long-haul traffic (which in turn drove the increase in cargo traffic). This was driven by additional passengers travelling to and from Hong Kong (+64%), New York (+49.9%) and Tianjin (+28.4%). The increase in short-haul traffic was driven by growth in passenger traffic to and from Paris (+30.7%) and Milan (+3.4%).|$|E
25|$|Air and {{maritime}} transport is developing in Georgia, {{with the former}} mainly used by passengers and the latter for transport of freight. Georgia currently has four international airports; the largest of which is by far Tbilisi International Airport, hub for Georgian Airways, which offers connections to many large European cities. Other airports {{in the country are}} largely underdeveloped or lack <b>scheduled</b> <b>traffic,</b> although, as of late, efforts have been made to solve both these problems. There are a number of seaports along Georgia's Black Sea coast, the largest and most busy of which is the Port of Batumi; whilst the town is itself a seaside resort, the port is a major cargo terminal in the Caucasus and is often used by neighbouring Azerbaijan as a transit point for making energy deliveries to Europe. Scheduled and chartered passenger ferry services link Georgia with Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|Caledonian's transatlantic growth {{strategy}} {{focused on}} {{taking advantage of}} strong ethnic ties of overseas Scottish communities in North America {{to the land of}} their ancestors and an obscure International Air Transport Association (IATA) resolution dating from 1953. Under this resolution, airlines were permitted to offer cut-price charter tariffs if these were negotiated with an individual representing a distinct group that shared a common affinity among its members prior to the application for charter transportation. The way independent charter operators like Caledonian, who were not IATA members, interpreted that resolution was that it applied to closed groups only whose primary purpose of travel was their common interest or kinship, rather than securing cheap air fares for its members. IATA imposed further restrictions on airlines seeking to exploit this loophole by insisting that any agent booking these flights had their commission capped at 5%, that the affinity group's membership could not exceed 20,000 and that those seeking to avail themselves of these offers must have been members for at least six months prior to the commencement of travel. These restrictions were designed to protect IATA members' transatlantic <b>scheduled</b> <b>traffic</b> by preventing non-members from undercutting them.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm {{which can be}} used for <b>scheduling</b> arrival air <b>traffic</b> in an Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC or Center) entering a Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) Facility.

The restrictions employed fall under the category of Miles-in-Trail, one of two principal traffic separation techniques used in <b>scheduling</b> arrival <b>traffic.</b> The algorithm calculates aircraft separations for each stream of aircraft destined to the TRACON. The calculations depend upon TRACON characteristics, TMC preferences, and other parameters adapted to the specific needs of <b>scheduling</b> <b>traffic</b> in a Center.

500|$|Construction of {{a runway}} {{expansion}} from [...] {{was started in}} 1988, allowing the airport to be served by jet aircraft in international charter traffic. The 15.3 million Norwegian krone (NOK) investment was financed through a municipal and county-guaranteed loan. Since 1984, the owners had hoped that the airport would {{become part of a}} state financing scheme that secured both guarantees for the operation of the airport, as well as subsidies to <b>scheduled</b> <b>traffic.</b> Geilo never received such status, unlike the nearby Fagernes Airport, Leirin which opened in 1987. By 1992, the mayors of Hol and Nore og Uvdal, the municipalities who owned the airport, admitted that it had been a mistake to build the airport. There were less than 1,000 passengers annually, and the <b>scheduled</b> <b>traffic</b> with Coast Air cost the municipalities NOK 1 million per year. In addition came the operating deficit of the airport itself. The company Norcharter had been created by Hol and Nore og Uvdal, along with private investors, but it failed to increase ridership, despite spending NOK 8 million on marketing the region and the airport.|$|E
