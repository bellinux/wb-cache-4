Problem specification Let a <b>structured</b> <b>financial</b> <b>product</b> be made up of an envelope of J different assets such that the investor has the right to claim the return on the best-performing asset out of that envelope after a stipulated lock-in period [1]. Then, if one of the J assets in the envelope is the risk-free asset then the investor gets assured of a minimum return equal to the risk-free rate i on his invested capital at the termination of the stipulated lock-in period. This effectively means that his or her investment becomes endogenously capital-guaranteed as the terminal wealth, even at its worst, cannot be lower in value to the initial wealth plus the return earned on the risk-free asset minus a finite cost of portfolio insurance, which is paid as the premium to the option writer. The expected present value of terminal option payof...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} order flow of {{discount}} certificates, {{its dependence on}} product age, and the implications for issuer pricing behavior. Based on a unique data set of exchange trades and issuer quotes, we find that for tax reasons investors prefer to buy products that mature in just over 1 Â year from the date of purchase. Furthermore, they tend to sell products back preferably close to maturity. These patterns in the trade direction allow us to separate the issuer pricing behavior from (i) the life cycle and (ii) the order flow. We find evidence that 7 out of 11 issuers anticipate the order flow and price in an additional margin in phases of positive expected net sales.

40|$|Abstract During {{the past}} decade, a <b>structured</b> <b>financial</b> <b>product</b> called “Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) ” has been drawing much {{attention}} of researchers and practitioners, {{and is now}} traded with growing liquidity. However, the approach for CDO pricing has been rather limited in the literature, largely because {{it is necessary to}} evaluate the time dependent distribution of the underlying cumulative loss so as to find the pricing scheme satisfying the non-arbitrage condition of the derivatives market. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to fill this gap by describing the CDO model in terms of a semi-Markov modulated Poisson process. Based on the theoretical results of Huang and Sumita [6] as well as the Laguerre transform method, numerical algorithms are developed for evaluating the time dependent distribution of the cumulative loss up to time t, which in turn enables one to evaluate the price of a CDO tranche. Some numerical results are presented, demonstrating the power of the algorithms...|$|E

40|$|The {{start of}} the 21 st century {{witnessed}} the rejuvenation of <b>structured</b> <b>financial</b> <b>products</b> that {{date back to the}} early 1970 s. Since 2000, the derivatives market has experienced significant growth as interest in <b>structured</b> <b>financial</b> <b>products</b> has increased substantially. Despite this strong growth, both in Australia and globally, recent evidence shows a lack of interest from investment managers in utilising derivatives. To this effect, the Australian Stock Exchange has undertaken a number of initiatives to raise the awareness of opportunities for investors in the options market. This thesis aims to contribute to the literature on <b>structured</b> <b>financial</b> <b>products</b> and assist investors in examining opportunities in the Australian options market. This thesis investigates a number of <b>structured</b> <b>financial</b> <b>products</b> in particular: the buy–write strategy and extreme portfolio trading strategies. It first examines the performance of the buy–write option strategy on the Australian Stock Exchange and analyses whether such an investment opportunity violates the efficient market hypothesis {{on the basis of its}} risk and returns. The study investigates the relation between buy–write portfolios returns and past trading volume and other fundamental financial factors, including dividend yield, firm size, book-to-market ratio, earnings per share, price earnings ratio, and value stocks within these portfolios. It also tests the profitability of the buy–write strategy during bull and bear markets. The thesis next examines extreme portfolio trading strategies. It investigates the profitability of equity, call, and put option-based extreme portfolio trading strategies on the Australian Stock Exchange and analyses whether they generate consistent abnormal returns. It also analyses the relation between equity- and option-based extreme portfolio returns and different financial fundamentals, as well as the performance of extreme portfolio trading strategies during different market conditions. As far as the buy–write strategy is concerned, the results of this study are consistent with the literature. This thesis determines that the buy–write strategy offers superior risk-adjusted returns for low levels of out-of-the-moneyness; however, it notes contrary evidence for deeper out-of-the-money portfolios. In line with other Australian buy–write strategy studies, this study also finds an Australian preference for options with a maturity of around three months. It shows that quarterly rebalancing periods offer better returns for the buy–write strategy. This study’s empirical results on extreme portfolio trading strategies are consistent with the literature, demonstrating that applying options in extreme portfolio strategies is profitable in Australia and that options can be used to enhance equity contrarian strategy profits...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{uses the}} example of the failure of bankers and {{financial}} managers to understand the risks of dealing in <b>structured</b> <b>financial</b> <b>products,</b> prior to the financial collapse, to investigate how people respond to crises. It focuses on whether crises cause people to challenge their habitual frames by the application of moral imagination. It is proposed that the <b>structure</b> of <b>financial</b> <b>products</b> and their markets triggered the use of heuristics that contributed to the underestimation of risks. It is further proposed that such framing heuristics are highly specialised to specific contexts, and are part of a wider set of heuristics that people carry in their cognitive ‘adaptive tool boxes’. Consequently, it is argued, when a crisis occurs the heuristics are not challenged, but are simply put away, and other more appropriate heuristics put to use until a sense of normality returns, {{and the use of the}} old heuristics is resumed...|$|R

40|$|The {{decline in}} the sub-prime market in the United State of America in 2007 - 2008 and the {{corresponding}} {{decline in the}} market values of other financial investments has had a significant financial impact {{on many of the}} individuals and organisations who participated in aggressively promoted investment schemes. The New South Wales (NSW) Local Government Councils was one such group of organisations impacted by the decline in value of these types of investments. At the end of the 2006 - 2007 financial year local councils in New South Wales had invested $ 590 million dollars in <b>structured</b> <b>financial</b> <b>products</b> such as collateralised debt obligations (CDO). By the end of January 2008, six months later, the market value of these investments dropped $ 200 million (34 %) to $ 390 million.

40|$|With the {{proliferation}} of equity derivatives and related <b>structured</b> <b>financial</b> <b>products,</b> the North American conception of corporate governance faces a new and distinct challenge to its underlying premises. This Article analyzes these developments {{with a focus on}} the implications for director and officer accountability and corporate sustainability, using the occasion of the third symposium of the Adolf A. Berle, Jr. Center on Corporations, Law 2 ̆ 6 Society to consider whether Berle’s analysis of corporate accountability offers any insights into how to address the uncoupling of economic interest and legal rights in corporate governance. Part II of this Article sets the context for the discussion, distinguishing the model of corporate governance prevalent in the United States from models applied elsewhere. It also briefly discusses why Berle’s shareholder-accountability model resonated with governance challenges at the time Berle wrote. Part III examines how the introduction of equity swaps and similarly <b>structured</b> <b>financial</b> <b>products</b> has, in a number of instances, uncoupled legal rights and economic interests, fundamentally challenging some of the underlying rationales for the shareholder- primacy model. Part IV discusses director and officer accountability in jurisdictions where equity swaps have become prevalent, and Part V considers directors hedging their own risk through derivatives activities. Part VI briefly examines why some of the current regulatory initiatives do not address the accountability concerns raised by derivativesactivities, and Part VII provides some initial thoughts as to how Berle’s original reasoning might be adapted to a more nuanced model of corporate governance and accountability. Part VIII concludes by noting that Berle’s analysis that the exercise of corporate power is subject to the equitable limitation that it cannot harm the interests of equity holders can potentially be applied to a broader set of stakeholders, and that the good faith conduct of directors and officers {{may play a role in}} determining what economic interest is actually at risk...|$|R
5000|$|Structured finance {{went from}} 28% of Moody's revenue in 1998 to almost 50% in 2007, and [...] "accounted for {{pretty much all}} of Moody's growth" [...] during that time.

Although credit risk explains a major part (39 %) of the certificates' overpricing, we find that issuer default risk does not have any influence on investors' product choices. Instead, retail investors are strongly influenced by irrational factors such as issuer and product familiarity. Finally, investors are found to make poor product choices (in terms of bid/ask spreads and markups over fair value), resulting in significant losses. 21 page(s...|$|R
