The results suggested that, when equal torque is applied, grub screws are superior in providing stability in axial loading. The grub <b>screw</b> <b>point</b> profile may produce {{a better grip}} on the half pin than that on the bolt when the same torque is used, but when both types of screws are mounted applying maximum torque, bolts demonstrate a significantly higher threshold for loads prior to loosening. This reinforces the clinical practice to increase tightening torque in application so that an increase in clamp force is achieved and correspondingly the tolerance to load to failure.|$|E

Although the results achieved by these authors with distal radius plates are promising, they used plates that were not intended for this fracture. The single distal locking row in the distal radius plates used in these studies are meant to buttress the articular surface of the distal radius in a raft fashion, with all the <b>screws</b> <b>pointing</b> in the same direction. The most significant complication described by these studies was pull-out of the plate when the plate had too little grip in a small or osteoporotic lateral fragment. Some authors advise suture augmentation of the coracoclavicular ligaments or coracoclavicular fixation in such cases [7, 9]. In our opinion, pull-out occurred in these cases for these plates {{because they did not}} neutralize the downward forces acting on the lateral end of the fracture sufficiently.|$|R

5000|$|Set screws are {{not always}} {{the best way to}} resist the torque of driven shafts. To reduce the chance of {{slipping}} and to increase load capacity, a detent (often called a [...] "flat") may be milled or ground at the part of the shaft where the set <b>screw's</b> <b>point</b> contacts. The detent, however, must be closely aligned with the threaded hole prior to fastening. The operator can often feel the screw push the flat into final alignment as he or she makes the last half- or quarter-turn that tightens the screw. Set screws can successfully hold against heavy-torque applications if the details are right. For example, endmill holders of the solid type typically use large set screws holding against flats to fasten the endmill, and heavy loads are resisted. However, small set screws without flats are prone to spinning and galling if overloaded. The use of keys and keyways instead of, or in combination with, set screws is common for applications requiring high torque resistance or transmission. Splines offer yet more strength.|$|R

To analyze anatomic landmarks and safe zones for optimal screw placement through the posterior {{arc of the}} human atlas, morphometric parameters of 41 adult native human atlas specimens were quantitatively measured. Internal dimensions of the atlas (lateral mass, maximum and minimum intraosseous screw length), minimum height and width of the posterior arc and optimal screw insertion angles were defined on pQCT scans. By this, an optimal posterior <b>screw</b> insertion <b>point</b> (OIP) and a preferable screw direction (PSD) through the posterior arch into the lateral mass of C 1 were defined. External dimensions (transverse and sagittal diameter) {{as well as the}} width of the mid-portion of C 1 lateral mass were significantly higher in male specimens. The mean height of the posterior arch at the vertebral artery groove was 4. 1  ±  0. 8  mm in female and 4. 6  ±  0. 9  mm in male specimens. The optimal <b>screw</b> insertion <b>point</b> was located 21. 6  ±  1. 7  mm in female and 23. 6  ±  2. 3  mm in male lateral from the posterior tubercle of C 1 (P <  0. 01).

In conclusion, the presented study provides information for the use and design of upper cervical spine instrumentation techniques, such as screw placement to C 1 via the posterior arch. The characterization of working areas and safe zones (OIP, PSD) might contribute to a minimization of screw malposition in this highly demanding instrumentation technique...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The use of {{thoracic}} pedicle screws in spinal deformity, trauma, and tumor reconstruction {{is becoming}} more common. Unsuccessful screw placement may require salvage techniques utilizing transverse process hooks. The effect of different starting point placement techniques {{on the strength of}} the transverse process has not previously been reported. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to determine the biomechanical properties of the thoracic transverse process following various pedicle <b>screw</b> starting <b>point</b> placement techniques. Methods Forty-seven fresh-frozen human cadaveric thoracic vertebrae from T 2 to T 9 were disarticulated and matched by bone mineral density (BMD) and transverse process (TP) cross-sectional area. Specimens were randomized to one of four groups: A, control, and three others based on thoracic pedicle screw placement technique; B, straightforward; C, funnel; and D, in-out-in. Initial cortical bone removal for pedicle screw placement was made using a burr at the location on the transverse process or transverse process-laminar junction as published in the original description of each technique. The transverse process was tested measuring load-to-failure simulating a hook in compression mode. Analysis of covariance and Pearson correlation coefficients were used to examine the data. Results Technique was a significant predictor of load-to-failure (P = 0. 0007). The least squares mean (LS mean) load-to-failure of group A (control) was 377 N, group B (straightforward) 355 N, group C (funnel) 229 N, and group D (in-out-in) 301 N. Significant differences were noted between groups A and C, A and D, B and C, and C and D. BMD (0. 925 g/cm 2 [range, 0. 624 - 1. 301 g/cm 2]) was also a significant predictor of load-to-failure, for all specimens grouped together (P P 0. 05). Level and side tested were not found to significantly correlate with load-to-failure. Conclusions The residual coronal plane compressive strength of the thoracic transverse process is dependent upon the <b>screw</b> starting <b>point</b> placement technique. The funnel technique significantly weakens transverse processes as compared to the straightforward technique, which does not significantly weaken the transverse process. It is also dependent upon bone mineral density, and low failure loads even in some control specimens suggest limited usefulness of the transverse process for axial compression loading in the osteoporotic thoracic spine. </p...|$|R
