5|$|Metallic silver, like copper, is an {{antibacterial}} agent, {{which was}} known to the ancients and first scientifically investigated and named the oligodynamic effect by Carl Nägeli. Silver ions damage the metabolism of bacteria even at such low concentrations as 0.01–0.1milligrams per litre; metallic silver has a similar effect due {{to the formation of}} <b>silver</b> <b>oxide.</b> This effect is lost in the presence of sulfur due to the extreme insolubility of silver sulfide.|$|E
25|$|Most metal nitrates {{thermally}} {{decompose to}} the respective oxides, but <b>silver</b> <b>oxide</b> decomposes {{at a lower}} temperature than silver nitrate, so the decomposition of silver nitrate yields elemental silver instead.|$|E

The technique allows {{the identification of the}} constituents of the thin tarnishing layers and also its relative abundance. A much more complex composition than the silver sulphide commonly associated with silver tarnish has been found, namely, <b>silver</b> chlorides, <b>silver</b> <b>oxides</b> and minor amounts of silver sulphide on the pure <b>silver,</b> plus copper <b>oxides</b> and a mixed copper-silver sulphide on the sterling silver samples.

2500|$|Chemically, silver is {{not very}} reactiveit does not react with oxygen or water at {{ordinary}} temperatures, so does not easily form a <b>silver</b> <b>oxide.</b> However, it is attacked by common components of atmospheric pollution: silver sulfide slowly appears as a black tarnish during [...] exposure to airborne compounds of sulfur (byproducts of the {{burning of fossil fuels}} and some industrial processes), and low level ozone [...] reacts to form <b>silver</b> <b>oxide.</b> As the purity of the silver decreases, the problem of corrosion or tarnishing increases because other metals in the alloy, usually copper, may react with oxygen in the air.|$|E

40|$|The {{chemistry}} of binary and multinary <b>silver</b> <b>oxides</b> spans from subvalent species (with a mean oxidation number for Ag smaller than +[*] 1) to compounds with Ag in high oxidation states as +[*] 2 and +[*] 3. We have investigated {{a range of}} <b>silver</b> <b>oxides,</b> including the binary compounds Ag 2 O, AgO, Ag 3 O 4 and Ag 2 O 3 as well as subvalent ternary oxides, by AgL 3 and AgL 1 XANES spectroscopy. The different valence states of silver are clearly reflected in AgL 3 and AgL 1 XANES spectra. The method thus allows the determination of average oxidation numbers. In addition, the degree of electronic interaction (localized or delocalized electronic states) in silver-oxygen compounds can be estimated {{on the basis of}} AgL 3 XANES spectra...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} of <b>silver</b> metal <b>oxide</b> contacts on a purposed built apparatus to investigate the extent of erosion under opening (break) operations. The investigation focused on opening the contacts under AC loading of up to 30 A rms and opening these contacts at particular points in the current duty cycle (or Point-On-Wave, POW). A number of erosion and deposition mechanisms have been observed to dominate at particular current loading which were also dependent on the point-on-wave opening. These mechanisms were found to balance at particular current values and point-on-wave opening leading to a net zero mass transfer between the two contacts. This paper presents data on mass transfer against these two parameters of current and point-on-wave showing the net zero mass transfer curve. It {{was found that the}} curve was the same for both <b>silver</b> tin <b>oxide</b> and <b>silver</b> cadmium <b>oxide.</b> However, in the case of <b>silver</b> tin <b>oxide</b> the magnitude of erosion and deposition was larger than in the <b>silver</b> cadmium <b>oxide</b> case.

40|$|Studies are {{conducted}} on <b>silver</b> metal <b>oxide</b> contacts on a purposed built apparatus {{to investigate the}} extent of contact erosion under opening (break) operations. The contacts are opened between 0. 1 and 0. 8 ms- 1 at particular point-on-wave, tPOW, of the ac waveform. Current loading of up to 30 A rms, Irms is investigated. Contact material deposition, as well as mass loss, is observed and is found to balance at particular current values and point-on-wave opening leading to a net zero mass loss on the contacts. Results are presented on mass change for each contact against the two parameters of current and point-on-wave. An arc duration characteristic, ?, is plotted against current, Irms which has a net zero mass loss.
