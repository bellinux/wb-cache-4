5|$|That night I {{asked the}} Mother of God {{what was to}} become of me. Then she came to me holding two crowns, one white, the other red. <b>She</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> if I was willing to accept either of these crowns. The white one meant that I should persevere in purity, and the red that I should become a martyr. I said that I would accept them both.|$|E
25|$|I {{composed}} the fugue first and {{wrote it down}} while I was thinking out the prelude. I only {{hope that you will}} be able to read it, for it is written so very small; and I hope further that you will like it. Another time I shall send you something better for the clavier. My dear Constanze is really the cause of this fugue's coming into the world. Baron van Swieten, to whom I go every Sunday, gave me all the works of Händel and Sebastian Bach to take home with me (after I had played them to him). When Constanze heard the fugues, she absolutely fell in love with them. Now she will listen to nothing but fugues, and particularly (in this kind of composition) the works of Händel and Bach. Well, as she has often heard me play fugues out of my head, <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> if I had ever written any down, and when I said I had not, she scolded me roundly for not recording some of my compositions in this most artistically beautiful of all musical forms and never ceased to entreat me until I wrote down a fugue for her.|$|E

500|$|After high school, Barbette {{began his}} circus career as {{one-half}} of the aerialist team The Alfaretta Sisters. One of the sisters had died unexpectedly and Barbette answered the surviving sister's ad for a replacement, auditioning in San Antonio. Together the pair {{decided that it was}} more dramatic for a woman to perform the acrobatic stunts. [...] "She told me that women's clothes always make a wire act more impressive...and <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> if I'd mind dressing as a girl. I didn't; and that's how it began." [...] Following his time as an Alfaretta, Barbette next joined an act called Erford's Whirling Sensation. This act included three people who hung from a spinning apparatus by their teeth.|$|E
500|$|In a 2008 {{speech in}} Washington, Gillard {{endorsed}} the ANZUS Alliance {{and described the}} United States as a civilising global influence. Her former colleague and leader Mark Latham wrote in a 2009 article for the Australian Financial Review that these comments were [...] "hypocritical", given past private communications Gillard had exchanged with him which apparently mocked elements of American foreign policy: [...] "One of them concerned her study tour of the US, sponsored by the American Government in 2006—or to use her moniker—'a CIA re-education course'. <b>She</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to 'stand by for emails explaining George Bush is a great statesman, torture is justified in many circumstances and those Iraqi insurgents should just get over it'." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, she was {{featured}} partially nude in leading Indian photographer Dabboo Ratnani's annual calendar, {{which is a}} major happening in the Indian glamour industry. According to Daboo, [...] "Her mother saw it much later, after the calendar released. She thought it was too sexy, and Riya shouldn't have done it. But {{the response to the}} photograph was superb. Riya was so thrilled that for her next ad campaign, <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to light her up like I did in this." [...] A career highlight for the model, it led to a three-year contract with Ratnani to feature her on his annual calendar. She is the only female face to be featured on the calendar for five consecutive years (2003–07).|$|E

500|$|Sapochnik {{was asked}} in an {{interview}} what the most difficult shot was to direct, responding [...] "The final sequence of seeing the armada {{on its way to}} Westeros was complicated because it involved so many different ships, and we only had one that we had to redress and shoot again and again. It was also raining and freezing when we shot it, and {{it was meant to be}} a Mediterranean climate. Emilia Clarke got so cold, her jaw started shaking uncontrollably and she totally lost her thread as far as what she was meant to be thinking in that moment, the cold will do that. <b>She</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to help, so I suggested that she just hum the theme to Game of Thrones in her head while we were rolling the cameras, and apparently that worked because it's the take we used in the final cut!" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Beautiful" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Linda Perry. Aguilera recorded the song at two studios: The Enterprise Studios in Burbank, California, and Conway Recording Studios in Hollywood. Prior to the collaboration with Aguilera, Perry {{had written the}} song and originally wished to keep the [...] "personal" [...] record for her own singing career. Perry initially previewed the song for Pink during the recording sessions of Pink's second studio album Missundaztood (2001), on which Perry is a producer. However, after hearing Aguilera sing the song at Perry's house to [...] "break the ice", Perry was very impressed and allowed Aguilera to include the track on her then upcoming record Stripped, effectively deciding not to pursue a solo career. The choice resulted in a feud between Pink against Aguilera and Perry, with the former commenting that it was [...] "annoying" [...] for the latter to collaborate with artists [...] " [...] didn't like". Perry later revealed to ASCAP, [...] "When Christina came {{over to my house}} to start working, <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to play some songs to break the ice. [...] I had a long conversation with my manager about it. We both decided to hear Christina sing it. We demoed the song with her singing it, and I was like, 'Wow'. That rough vocal is what is out there on radio. It was that vocal that got her the song". Perry's wife Sara Gilbert confirmed on her show The Talk that the final version was [...] "just a demo." [...] Gilbert also revealed that Aguilera wanted to rerecord the song because she didn't like the initial vocals. Perry denied the request because the song is supposed to be about imperfection and being vulnerable.|$|E
500|$|David Hill, 18, {{was asked}} to [...] "sit in" [...] at the house, and while there heard Dudson shout [...] "Shut up, you slag!" [...] in the back room. When he asked what was going on, Leigh had shown him Capper. He said: [...] "She {{had a sort of}} cloth over her face, from just above the eyebrows and {{covering}} her nose. She had a bit of dried blood on her lip. She had no hair." [...] Hill also said he had heard them talking about [...] "dentistry work. It was something about pulling her teeth out with a pair of pliers." [...] Later, he was left alone in the house with Capper, who pleaded with him to untie her. He said: [...] "She asked me if I could help but I told her I couldn't. I asked her who she was. She said her name was Suzanne. <b>She</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> if I could untie her. I said I couldn't do anything." [...] He later claimed that he was too afraid of Leigh to intervene or raise the alarm, saying: [...] "I thought they would batter me. If I'd said [...] they'd all have got me, wouldn't they? I didn't know what to do. I was too shocked to do anything." [...] While Capper was being held in the house, Leigh and Dudson met up with her sister's fiance Paul Barlow to help him repair his car. Barlow said: [...] "They could have told me there and then. The door would have been kicked down and I would have got Suzanne out. I did not think they were capable of such savagery. Now all I want is ten minutes with them in a back room." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{knew her}} fairly well. I met her right after Eli and the Thirteenth Confession. I {{actually}} had arranged a meeting, just because I was so infatuated {{with her and}} I wanted to meet {{the person who had}} produced all this music. We got along, and we were kind of friendly, and actually, after I met her the first time, <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> if I wanted to be her band leader. But the Nazz had just signed a record contract and I couldn't skip out on the band, even though it was incredibly tempting." ...|$|E
2500|$|During this period, Viglione {{also was}} heavily {{involved}} with various side-projects and albums; First with New York singer, Emilyn Brodsky. Of playing with Emilyn, Viglione has been {{quoted as saying}} [...] "Emilyn and I have been friends {{for a long time and}} when <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to produce and play on her album of ukulele songs I was thrilled and, surprisingly, wound up playing marimba on it as well." [...] After that, he worked on Black Tape for a Blue Girl's album 10 Neurotics. Viglione recorded his parts for 12 of the 14 tracks (drums, bass & guitar) in December 2008 and January 2009, at B.C. Studio, owned by Martin Bisi, where the first Dresden Dolls album was recorded. [...] He also co-produced the album. In both cases, Viglione performed multiple instruments and helped shape the arrangements and sonic direction of the albums.|$|E
