The effects of battery design and operation strategies adapted for primary control supply are investigated {{with regard to}} costs and parameters relevant for battery aging. Primary control is required to balance the feed-in and use of electricity to/from the grid, thereby ensuring safe and stable grid operation. In Germany, primary control is traded on a separate auction market with specific regulations. These regulations (minimum bid size of 1 MW, contract period of one week) offer the opportunity of a market entry for <b>stationary</b> <b>battery</b> systems and allow for {{a certain degree of}} flexibility regarding system configurations and operation strategies. However, little is known about how battery design and operation profiles, resulting from the participation in the primary control market, may affect costs and aging behaviour. Based on simulations of battery operation, various battery designs, which are distinct in terms of capacity, as well as several operation strategies are compared. These operation strategies compared include the state of charge (SoC) bandwidth, within which the battery operates, as well as the purchase of balancing energy from other electricity markets to ensure operation throughout the contract period. Results cover operation profiles in terms of SoC and C-rate distribution over time as well as the numbers of charging and discharging cycles for the various designs and operation strategies.

40|$|Large <b>stationary</b> <b>battery</b> {{plants are}} reliect upon to deliver {{emergency}} power to mission critical equipment {{ranging from a}} few seconds to many hours. The discharge rate and specific load at which they are discharged ultimately determines the actual current demanded of them. Power engineers and system designers strive to make the best material and economic choices to satisfy the needs of the system. From tlle maintenance perspective, maintaining reliable connection integrity should be considered paramount in operating a reliable battery plant. This paper will explore the fundamentals of establishing, tracking and maintaining connection integrity for large <b>stationary</b> <b>battery</b> plants and discuss the resulting effects of neglecting to address the requirements established by the industry. Basic Premise Users of stationary batteries expect a high degree of reliability from their battery plants. A major factor concerning connection integrity focuses on the need for reliable, trouble free connections. Additionally, a minimum amount of voltage drop, hence low power dissipation is desirable during periods of battery discharge. Among several methods, two are popular that have been employed to determine battery connection integrity. Method one involves measuring the voltage drop across each bolted connection during a test discharge. Method two employs the use of an instrument known as a micro-ohmmeter. This paper will deal with the latter of the two measurement methods described and techniques used to track the data take...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years, <b>stationary</b> <b>battery</b> systems started {{to attract the}} {{attention}} of stakeholders thanks to their unique ability to decouple power generation and load over time, providing the ancillary services necessary for the stability and the reliability of the electrical system. This is especially true in the presence of high levels of penetration of renewable energy technologies, like wind and solar photovoltaic (PV), because of increased fluctuations in the electricity produced by these renewable sources. Despite the growing interest in energy storage technologies, the academic literature has not completely assessed the development trends of this sector.

40|$|The {{increase}} in continuous loads such as radio transmitters and microprocessors in substations {{has led some}} utilities, including ours, {{to take a closer}} look at the sizing of the <b>stationary</b> <b>batteries</b> that operate those stations when commercial power is lost. Critical functions, such as tripping circuit breakers and conununicating information to dispatch centers, are placed on DC power. When station power is present, that DC power for the continuous loads is supplied by the charger. When conunercial power is lost, however, the continuous loads are carried by the batteries, which must also have the capacity to operate tripping mechanisms. IEEE Standard 485 I is widely accepted as the guideline for sizing of <b>stationary</b> <b>batteries,</b> and its application is discussed. Once a battery is placed in service, its maintenance, monitoring and periodic testing protocols are the next issues that the utility considers. Those practiced by this utility are discussed, including monitoring of the presence of DC power at certain critical points by SCADA equipment. The COIIlIOOnvoltages in electric utility substations are 48 and 120. 48 volt systems are more common, and are the preferred choice when allowable because of their smaller physical size and ease of maintenance. In some stations, however, the physical size of the station requires the higher voltage in order to lower the current and thus the voltage drop. Changes in equipment over the last twenty years have caused an {{increase in}} the continuous loads placed on substation batteries. In the 1970 s, the continuous loads were generally these 2 : indicator lights on circuit breakers indicator lights on annunciator panel 0. 3 amps 0. 1 amp 0. 4 amp total The desire for remote control and monitoring of events in the substation, however, has caused additional equipment to be added to the load on the DC system.
