50|$|Annual and {{biennial}} weeds such as chickweed, annual meadow grass, shepherd's purse, groundsel, fat hen, cleaver, speedwell and hairy bittercress propagate themselves by seeding. Many produce {{huge numbers of}} seed several times a season, some all year round. Groundsel can produce 1000 seed, and can continue right through a mild winter, whilst <b>Scentless</b> <b>Mayweed</b> produces over 30,000 seeds per plant. Not all of these will germinate at once, but over several seasons, lying dormant in the soil sometimes for years until exposed to light. Poppy seed can survive 80-100 years, dock 50 or more. There can be many thousands of seeds in a square foot or square metre of ground, thus and soil disturbance will produce a flush of fresh weed seedlings.|$|E

40|$|Verticillium longisporum is a soil-borne fungal {{pathogen}} causing {{vascular wilt}} of Brassica crops. This {{study was conducted}} to enhance our knowledge on the host range of V. longisporum. Seven crop species (barley, oat, oilseed rape, pea, red clover, sugar beet and wheat) and five weed species (barren brome, black-grass, charlock, cleavers and <b>scentless</b> <b>mayweed)</b> all common in southern Sweden were evaluated for infection by response to V. longisporum. Oat, spring wheat, oilseed rape, <b>scentless</b> <b>mayweed</b> and charlock inoculated with V. longisporum in a greenhouse showed stunting to various degrees close to the fully ripe stage. Based on the extent of microsclerotia formation, explants were separated into four groups: for pea and wheat, 80 %. The results suggest that plant species outside the Brassicaceae can act as reservoirs of V. longisporum inoculum. Soil inoculum densities in nine fields were monitored over a period of 12 months, which ranged from 1 to 48 cfu g¿ 1 soil. Density of microsclerotia was lowest just after harvest, reaching its maximum six months later. No significant correlation between inoculum density in soil and disease incidence on oilseed rape plants was found. However, the data suggest that a threshold of 1 cfu g¿ 1 soil is needed to cause disease on oilseed rape. Species identification based on microsclerotia morphology and PCR analysis showed that V. longisporum dominated in soil of seven, and V. dahliae in two of the nine fields studied...|$|E
40|$|Weeds {{currently}} {{represent a}} constant {{risk to the}} crop plants. They are able to either suppress {{the development of a}} crop plant in the initial period of its growth or to hinder and even make the harvest impossible due to its stand density {{at the end of the}} vegetative phase before the harvest. Perennial weeds rank among very noxious weeds. They are highly resistant and able to adapt to the used control measures. The character of the crop plants itself and the applied agronomic practices determine the occurrence of different weed species. For this reason, the question of how to deal with weeds still remains crucial. The diploma thesis is focused on the occurrence and the harmful effects of selected weeds in two Maize hybrids (Zea mays). The incidence of weeds and the effect of herbicides on those weeds were monitored within an experiment conducted on a small plot of land. The following weed plants occurred: Couch-grass (Elytrigia repens L.), Creeping thistle (Cirsium arvense L.), Barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli L.), <b>Scentless</b> <b>mayweed</b> (Tripleurospermum inodorum L.), Goosegrass (Galium aparine L.) etc. The aim of the thesis is to expand knowledge of the use of different weed control methods in Maize. Recommendations on the use of those methods in agriculture shall be suggested...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} three decades, concern about food safety and the {{management}} of natural resources has increased. Instigated by the previous EU pesticide review, (EU 91 / 414) carrot growers in particular have been hit by the revocation of several post-emergence herbicides. There is real concern among growers that this may impair profits. To identify alternative weed control strategies, a modelling framework capable of simulating the impact of alternative weed management strategies on long-term weed population dynamics, was proposed. <b>Scentless</b> <b>mayweed</b> (Tripleurospermum inodorum) was chosen as model weed species. The system represented in ECOSEDYN (Effects of Cultural control and climate On SEedbank DYN For each component model in ECOSEDYN the literature was reviewed to identify the best mathematical representation and then the model was parameterised. To improve accuracy of model projections and address gaps in knowledge, field experiments were conducted in two areas: soil cultivation, and plant growth and reproduction. The results of the cultivation experiments revealed that key assumptions in models for weed seed re-distribution are incorrect. The experiments focusing on plant growth and reproduction resulted in a novel approach to the modeling of biomass increase, flowering and seed shedding where the different processes were quantitatively and temporally linked using Beta functions. amics), comprises a six-year crop rotation: one year of carrot and five years winter wheat and repeated four times. The weed management strategies consist of combinations of cultural control measures (sowing time and crop maturity time). In addition, the interaction of climate with the cultural control measures was assessed by implementing two future climate scenarios, (‘No change’ vs ‘Heating up’) based on weather data over the last 18 years. The results of the ECOSEDYN simulations showed that, regardless of the prevailing climate, choosing a fast maturing carrot cultivar {{is by far the}} most important factor in maintaining the weed seedbank low. In addition, the risk for higher seedbank levels in the long-term under ‘Heating up’ climate is largest if carrot is continuously sown late.

40|$|Phyto-oestrogens are a {{group of}} {{secondary}} plant metabolites that may bind to oestrogen receptors and exert oestrogenic or anti-oestrogenic effects in humans and can protect against cancer diseases. When ingested by dairy cows, phyto-oestrogens can be metabolised and transferred to the milk. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the effects of grazing a recently established pasture containing red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and an older pasture containing a variety of sown and unsown plant species on milk concentrations of phyto-oestrogens. Sixteen Norwegian Red dairy cows [mean (standard deviation); body weight 599 (45. 1) kg, stage of lactation 73 (15. 0) d in milk, milk yield 29. 9 (2. 90) kg/d at the start of the experiment] were divided into two groups and grazed either a short-term pasture (SP) or a long-term pasture (LP). The SP was representative of organically managed leys in Norway, which are frequently, approximately every third year, renewed by soil tillage and seeding, whereas LP was representative of organically managed grasslands that are less frequently renewed. The SP contained meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.) (mean 34 %), timothy (Phleum pratense L.) (mean 19 %), red clover (mean 28 %), shepherd׳s-purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medik.) (mean 6 %), pineappleweed (Matricaria matricarioides Porter ex Britton) (mean 5 %) and <b>scentless</b> <b>mayweed</b> (Tripleurospermum perforatum (Mérat) Laínz) (mean 4 %), and LP contained mainly white clover (Trifolium repens L.) (mean 21 %), smooth meadowgrass (Poa pratensis L.) (mean 19 %), timothy (mean 17 %), meadow fescue (mean 15 %), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) (mean 6 %), tufted hairgrass (Deschampsia cespitosa (L.) P. Beauv.) (mean 5 %), northern dock (Rumex longifolius DC.) (mean 4 %), common couch (Elytrigia repens (L.) Desv. Ex Nevski) (mean 4 %), red clover (mean 3 %) and dandelion (Taraxacum spp.) (mean 3 %). In addition to a daily pasture allowance of 20 kg dry matter per cow, supplements of 3. 0 kg barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) concentrate were fed. Herbage, concentrates and milk was sampled during the last week of three experimental periods and analysed for phyto-oestrogens using LC-MS/MS technology. Herbage from SP had 19 times higher concentration of isoflavones than herbage from LP, whereas only small differences were found for lignans. Milk produced on SP had 14 times higher concentrations of the mammalian isoflavonoid equol, and the concentrations of equol were higher than found in most other studies. This study confirms that grazing pastures containing red clover increases concentrations of isoflavones and especially equol in bovine milk compared to grazing pastures with other botanical composition. The higher milk concentrations of the lignan metabolite enterodiol in milk from SP compared to LP could not be related to differences in intake of the analysed lignans and may therefore be related to unidentified lignans...|$|E
