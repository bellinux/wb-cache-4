5|$|Most {{people with}} obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} have concurrent obstructive sleep apnea, a condition characterized by snoring, brief episodes of apnea (cessation of breathing) during the night, interrupted sleep and excessive daytime <b>sleepiness.</b> In OHS, <b>sleepiness</b> may be worsened by elevated {{blood levels of}} carbon dioxide, which causes drowsiness ("CO2 narcosis"). Other symptoms present in both conditions are depression, and hypertension (high blood pressure) {{that is difficult to}} control with medication. The high carbon dioxide can also cause headaches, which tend to be worsening in the morning.|$|E
5|$|In {{depressed}} {{people who}} experience symptoms of <b>sleepiness</b> and fatigue, bupropion {{has been found}} to be more effective than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in alleviating these symptoms. There appears to be a modest advantage for the SSRIs over bupropion in the treatment of anxious depression.|$|E
5|$|In older {{children}} and adolescents, {{the symptoms of}} hypothyroidism may include fatigue, cold intolerance, <b>sleepiness,</b> muscle weakness, constipation, a delay in growth, overweight for height, pallor, coarse and thick skin, increased body hair, irregular menstrual cycles in girls, and delayed puberty. Signs may include delayed relaxation of the ankle reflex and a slow heart beat. A goiter may be present with a completely enlarged thyroid gland; sometimes {{only part of the}} thyroid is enlarged and it can be knobby in character.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam, marketed {{under the}} trade name Versed, among others, is a {{medication}} used for anesthesia, procedural sedation, trouble sleeping, and severe agitation. It works by inducing <b>sleepiness,</b> decreasing anxiety, and causing {{a loss of}} ability to create new memories. It is also useful {{for the treatment of}} seizures. Midazolam can be given by mouth, intravenously, by injection into a muscle, sprayed into the nose, or in the cheek. When given intravenously, it typically begins working within five minutes; when injected into a muscle, it can take fifteen minutes to begin working. Effects last for between one and six hours.|$|E
5|$|Other {{drugs such}} as {{amantadine}} and anticholinergics may be useful as treatment of motor symptoms. However, the evidence supporting them lacks quality, so they are not first choice treatments. In addition to motor symptoms, PD {{is accompanied by a}} diverse range of symptoms. A number of drugs have been used to treat some of these problems. Examples are the use of quetiapine for psychosis, cholinesterase inhibitors for dementia, and modafinil for daytime <b>sleepiness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Side {{effects can}} include a {{decrease}} in efforts to breathe, low blood pressure, and <b>sleepiness.</b> Tolerance to its effects and withdrawal syndrome may occur following long-term use. Paradoxical effects, such as increased activity, can occur especially in children and older people. There is evidence of risk when used during pregnancy but no evidence of harm with a single dose during breastfeeding. It is of the benzodiazepine class and works through the GABA neurotransmitter.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} side effect {{is an increase}} in risk for epileptic seizures, which caused the drug to be withdrawn from the market for some time and then caused the recommended dosage to be reduced. In comparison to many other antidepressants, it does not cause as much weight gain, sexual dysfunction, or <b>sleepiness.</b> Bupropion acts as an norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It is an atypical antidepressant, different from most commonly prescribed antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} antidepressants, and the available evidence indicates that it is effective in clinical depression — as effective as several other widely prescribed drugs, including fluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil), although trends favoring the efficacy of escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft) and venlafaxine (Effexor) over bupropion have been observed. Mirtazapine (Remeron), on the other hand is significantly more effective than bupropion. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction. Bupropion treatment also is not associated with the <b>sleepiness</b> or weight gain that may be produced by other antidepressants.|$|E
5|$|Obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} Pickwickian syndrome) {{is a condition}} in which severely overweight people fail to breathe rapidly enough or deeply enough, resulting in low blood oxygen levels and high blood carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. Many people with this condition also frequently stop breathing altogether for short periods of time during sleep (obstructive sleep apnea), resulting in many partial awakenings during the night, which leads to continual <b>sleepiness</b> during the day. The disease puts strain on the heart, which eventually may lead to the symptoms such as heart failure, leg swelling and various other related symptoms. The most effective treatment is weight loss, but it is often possible to relieve the symptoms by nocturnal ventilation with positive airway pressure (CPAP) or related methods.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} foods and {{substances}} {{have been found}} to disturb sleep, due to stimulant effects or disruptive digestive demands. Avoiding nicotine, caffeine (including coffee, energy drinks, soft drinks, tea, chocolate, and some pain relievers), and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime is recommended by most sleep hygiene specialists, as these substances activate neurobiological systems that maintain wakefulness. Alcohol near bedtime is frequently discouraged by clinicians, because, although alcohol can induce <b>sleepiness</b> initially, the arousal caused by metabolizing alcohol can disrupt and significantly fragment sleep. Smoking tobacco products before bed is also thought to reduce one's quality of resting by decreasing the time spent in deep sleep, leading to sleep fragmentation and nocturnal restlessness. Both consumption of a large meal just before bedtime, requiring effort to metabolize it all, and hunger have been associated with disrupted sleep; clinicians may recommend eating a light snack before bedtime. Lastly, limiting intake of liquids before bedtime can prevent interruptions due to urinations.|$|E
5|$|Adverse {{effects from}} {{medications}} {{are reported in}} 10 to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom the data is collected. Most adverse effects are dose-related and mild. Some examples include mood changes, <b>sleepiness,</b> or an unsteadiness in gait. Certain medications have side effects that {{are not related to}} dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow. Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects. Some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy. Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbitol, and gabapentin have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects, especially when used during the first trimester. Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications. Among the antiepileptic medications, levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.|$|E
25|$|The Epworth <b>Sleepiness</b> Scale (ESS), {{designed}} to give an indication of <b>sleepiness</b> and correlated with sleep apnea, or other questionnaires {{designed to}} measure excessive daytime <b>sleepiness,</b> are diagnostic tools {{that can be used}} repeatedly to measure results of treatment.|$|E
25|$|Fatigue is {{generally}} considered a more long-term condition than <b>sleepiness</b> (somnolence). Although <b>sleepiness</b> can be a symptom of medical issues, it usually results from lack of restful sleep, {{or a lack of}} stimulation. Chronic fatigue, on the other hand, is a symptom of a greater medical problem in most cases. It manifests in mental or physical weariness and inability to complete tasks at normal performance. Both are often used interchangeably and even categorized under the description of 'being tired.' Oftentimes fatigue is described as an uncomfortable tiredness, whereas <b>sleepiness</b> is comfortable and inviting.|$|E
25|$|White {{turkey meat}} is often {{considered}} healthier than dark meat {{because of its}} lower fat content, but the nutritional differences are small. Although turkey is reputed to cause <b>sleepiness,</b> holiday dinners are commonly large meals served with carbohydrates, fats, and alcohol in a relaxed atmosphere, {{all of which are}} bigger contributors to post-meal <b>sleepiness</b> than the tryptophan in turkey.|$|E
25|$|Nithira Devi, the Goddess of <b>sleepiness</b> not {{to disturb}} {{unnecessarily}} the subjects of his nation.|$|E
25|$|Very common (≥10% incidence) {{adverse effects}} include constipation, dry mouth, <b>sleepiness,</b> {{increased}} appetite, and weight gain.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam in {{doses of}} 5mg or more causes {{significant}} deterioration in alertness performance combined with increased feelings of <b>sleepiness.</b>|$|E
25|$|A fever {{is usually}} {{accompanied}} by sickness behavior, {{which consists of}} lethargy, depression, anorexia, <b>sleepiness,</b> hyperalgesia, and the inability to concentrate.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms of OSA are noisy {{sleeping}} (snoring), excessive daytime <b>sleepiness,</b> morning headache, personality changes, {{and problems}} with judgment, memory, and attention.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of an overdose such as <b>sleepiness,</b> agitation and ataxia occur much more frequently and severely in children. Hypotonia may also occur in severe cases.|$|E
25|$|Behavioral therapies include {{progressive}} relaxation, stimulus control (to reassociate the {{bed with}} <b>sleepiness),</b> limiting time-in-bed to increase sleep efficiency and debunking misconceptions about sleep.|$|E
25|$|Another FDA-approved {{treatment}} {{option for}} narcolepsy is sodium oxybate, {{also known as}} sodium gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). It {{can be used for}} cataplexy associated with narcolepsy and excessive daytime <b>sleepiness</b> associated with narcolepsy.|$|E
25|$|Narcolepsy: Lesions {{along the}} PPT/LDT nuclei are {{associated}} with narcolepsy. There is a significant down-regulation of PPN output {{and a loss of}} orexin peptides, promoting the excessive daytime <b>sleepiness</b> that is characteristic of this disorder.|$|E
25|$|In most cases, {{the first}} symptom of {{narcolepsy}} to appear is excessive and overwhelming daytime <b>sleepiness.</b> The other symptoms may begin {{alone or in}} combination months or years after {{the onset of the}} daytime naps. There are wide variations in the development, severity, and order of appearance of cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations in individuals. Only about 20 to 25 percent of people with narcolepsy experience all four symptoms. The excessive daytime <b>sleepiness</b> generally persists throughout life, but sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations may not. A rare subset of narcoleptics also experience a heightened sense of taste and smell known as the supertaster phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Valproate in {{elderly people}} with {{dementia}} caused increased <b>sleepiness.</b> More people stopped the medication for this reason. Additional {{side effects of}} weight loss and decreased food intake was also associated in one half of people who become sleepy.|$|E
25|$|The {{circadian}} rhythm influences the ideal timing of a restorative sleep episode. <b>Sleepiness</b> increases during the night. REM sleep occurs more during body temperature minimum within the circadian cycle, whereas slow-wave sleep can occur more independently of circadian time.|$|E
25|$|The main {{treatment}} of excessive daytime <b>sleepiness</b> in narcolepsy is {{central nervous system}} stimulants such as methylphenidate, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, modafinil, and armodafinil. In late 2007 an alert for severe adverse skin reactions to modafinil was issued by the FDA.|$|E
25|$|GHB is {{the active}} {{ingredient}} in the prescription medication sodium oxybate (Xyrem). Sodium oxybate is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{for the treatment of}} cataplexy associated with narcolepsy and excessive daytime <b>sleepiness</b> (EDS) associated with narcolepsy.|$|E
25|$|Disturbances of the {{circadian}} rhythm, such as {{shift work}} and jet lag, can cause {{an inability to}} sleep at some {{times of the day}} and excessive <b>sleepiness</b> at other times of the day. Chronic circadian rhythm disorders are characterized by similar symptoms.|$|E
25|$|A 2011 Cochrane review {{found that}} {{compared}} with other antidepressants, {{it is more likely}} to cause weight gain and <b>sleepiness,</b> but it is less likely to cause tremor than tricyclic antidepressants, and less likely to cause nausea and sexual dysfunction than SSRIs.|$|E
25|$|Sleep trouble holds {{a chronic}} {{prevalence}} of over 50% {{in old age}} and results in daytime <b>sleepiness.</b> In a study of 9,000 persons {{with a mean age}} of 74, only 12% reported no sleep complaints. By age 65, deep sleep goes down to about 5%.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis is {{relatively}} easy when all the symptoms of narcolepsy are present, but if the sleep attacks are isolated and cataplexy is mild or absent, diagnosis is more difficult. It is also possible for cataplexy to occur in isolation. Three tests that are commonly used in diagnosing narcolepsy are the polysomnogram, the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and administration of the Epworth <b>Sleepiness</b> Scale. These tests are usually performed by a sleep specialist. The polysomnogram involves continuous recording of sleep brain waves {{and a number of}} nerve and muscle functions during night time sleep. When tested, people with narcolepsy fall asleep rapidly, enter REM sleep early, and may often awaken during the night. The polysomnogram also helps to detect other possible sleep disorders that could cause daytime <b>sleepiness.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Sleepiness</b> (12.5%), {{headache}} (3.8%), dizziness (3.8%), nervousness (2.7%), depression (2.5%), memory disturbances (2.3%), diplopia (2.2%), aggression (2.0%), ataxia (1.9%), vertigo (1.9%), hyperactivity (1.8%), {{vision loss}} (1.6%) (See below), confusion (1.4%), insomnia (1.3%), impaired concentration (1.2%), personality issues (1.1%). Out of 299 children, 33 (11%) became hyperactive.|$|E
25|$|Endogenous opioids include endorphins, enkephalins, dynorphins, {{and even}} {{morphine}} itself. Morphine appears to mimic endorphins. Endorphins, a contraction {{of the term}} endogenous morphines, are responsible for analgesia (reducing pain), causing <b>sleepiness,</b> and feelings of pleasure. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or excitement.|$|E
25|$|Often {{people with}} DSPD manage {{only a few}} hours sleep per night during the working week, then {{compensate}} by sleeping until the afternoon on weekends. Sleeping late on weekends, and/or taking long naps during the day, may give people with DSPD relief from daytime <b>sleepiness</b> but may also perpetuate the late sleep phase.|$|E
25|$|The {{hallmark}} {{symptom of}} OSA syndrome in adults is excessive daytime <b>sleepiness.</b> Typically, an adult or adolescent with severe long-standing OSA will fall asleep for very brief periods {{in the course}} of usual daytime activities if given any opportunity to sit or rest. This behavior may be quite dramatic, sometimes occurring during conversations with others at social gatherings.|$|E
