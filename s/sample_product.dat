But over them both there hung a deeper shade than the shade which Angel Clare perceived, namely, the shade of his own limitations. With all his attempted independence of judgement this advanced and well-meaning young man, a <b>sample</b> <b>product</b> of the last five-and-twenty years, was yet the slave to custom and conventionality when surprised back into his early teachings. No prophet had told him, {{and he was not}} prophet enough to tell himself, that essentially this young wife of his was as deserving of the praise of King Lemuel as any other woman endowed with the same dislike of evil, her moral value having to be reckoned not by achievement but by tendency. Moreover, the figure near at hand suffers on such occasion, because it shows up its sorriness without shade; while vague figures afar off are honoured, in that their distance makes artistic virtues of their stains. In considering what Tess was not, he overlooked what she was, and forgot that the defective can be more than the entire.|$|E

In 1941, just three years after Du Pont's announcement of nylon, Toray completed the basic research on nylon and started building a small plant to produce Nylon 6. The operation started in 1943 and the product was sold, mainly to make fishing nets.|$|E

50|$|The on-sale bar is an {{extraordinarily}} (some would argue needlessly) complex body of patent law {{in all but}} the simplest cases.

The normal standard of reduction to practice (which requires recognizing the invention) has been ignored in several cases, for example an offer for sale of a waste disposal machine which, if accepted would have practiced a later invention due to the special nature of the waste, was considered a barring sale even though the invention had not even been conceived yet and the sale did not take place.|$|E

This campus offers continuing education and curriculum classes, a campus bookstore and branch of the Gaston College Library in Harney Hall. Harney Hall was built in 1943 and has 64,000 square feet. The Classroom Building was built in 2003 and has 28,000 square feet and houses a 200-seat auditorium. The Kimbrell Campus is also home to the Textile Technology Center at Gaston College. The Center began operations in 1943 as the North Carolina Vocational Textile School, later renamed the North Carolina Center for Applied Textile Technology. It was transferred to Gaston College in 2005. In 2010, the name was changed to the W.

40|$|Figure 1 : From left to right: BRDF {{importance}} sampling, {{environment map}} importance sampling, and importance {{sampling of the}} combination of BRDF and environment. With our new technique we can efficiently <b>sample</b> the <b>product</b> of the BRDF and the environment map without evaluating the full <b>product.</b> <b>Sampling</b> the <b>product</b> results in a superior sampling distribution (shown in the right image) compared with sampling the individual functions (shown on the left). 100 samples were used for each image. The BRDF is a measured acrylic blue material, shown for a single normal and viewing direction, and the environment map is Grace cathedral. Sample points for the product were generated in 0. 1 milliseconds. We present a new technique for importance <b>sampling</b> <b>products</b> of complex functions using wavelets. First, we generalize previous work on wavelet products to higher dimensional spaces and show how this <b>product</b> can be <b>sampled</b> on-thefly without the need of evaluating the full product. This {{makes it possible to}} <b>sample</b> <b>products</b> of high-dimensional functions even if the product of the two functions in itself is too memory consuming. Then, we present a novel hierarchical sample warping algorithm that generates high-quality point distributions, which match the wavelet representation exactly. One application of the new sampling technique is rendering of objects with measured BRDFs illuminated by complex distant lighting — our results demonstrate how the new sampling technique is more than an order of magnitude more efficient than the best previous techniques...|$|R

40|$|The Swedish beauty {{industry}} face challenges with <b>product</b> <b>samples</b> as {{a promotion}} technique. The {{lack of a}} defined strategy results in a random distribution, which leads to weak ROI. However, <b>product</b> <b>samples</b> could be used proactively as a strategic marketing tool creating long-term brand value. This thesis provides a framework for L’Oréal to fulfill their objectives of using <b>product</b> <b>samples</b> – from strategy formation to tactical practice. Davies’s (1992) model “Using promotions {{as part of a}} strategic plan” is used as a sorting mechanism. We created a three-step process based on the model as a structure for this thesis: strategy preparation, strategy implementation, and strategy follow-up. Qualitative interviews and a quantitative survey proved that different <b>product</b> <b>sample</b> types require different strategies depending on the aim of the promotion. As a complement, targeted <b>product</b> <b>samples</b> via GlossyBox enabled L’Oréal to gain market insight and use <b>product</b> <b>samples</b> more strategically. ...|$|R
