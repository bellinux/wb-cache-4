5|$|Panama asked France to {{extradite}} Noriega {{so he could}} face trial for human rights violations in Panama. The French government had previously stated that extradition would not happen before the case in France had run its course. On September 23, 2011, a French court ordered a conditional release for Noriega to be extradited to Panama on October 1, 2011. Noriega was extradited to Panama on December 11, 2011, and incarcerated at El Renacer prison to <b>serve</b> <b>time</b> for crimes committed during his rule.|$|E
25|$|On June 12, 1978, Berkowitz {{was sentenced}} to 25-years-to-life in prison for each murder, to be served consecutively. He was ordered to <b>serve</b> <b>time</b> in Attica Correctional Facility, an Upstate New York supermax prison. Despite prosecutors' objections, the terms of Berkowitz's guilty plea made him {{eligible}} for parole in 25 years.|$|E
25|$|His funds {{exhausted}} {{and unable to}} pay just a single debt, James Greenleaf was sentenced to <b>serve</b> <b>time</b> in the Philadelphia Debtors' Prison. Although the exact date that he entered debtor's prison in 1797 is not known, he was definitely incarcerated by October 18, 1797.

50|$|The Arizona Department of Corrections {{reported}} in 2010 that illegal immigrants are over-represented in the state's prison population. In June 2010, illegal immigrants represented 14.8 percent of Arizona state prisoners, but accounted for 7 {{percent of the}} state's overall population according to the Department of Homeland Security. In addition, the data showed that illegal immigrants accounted for 40% of all the prisoners <b>serving</b> <b>time</b> in Arizona state prisons for kidnapping; 24% of those <b>serving</b> <b>time</b> for drug charges; and 13 percent of those <b>serving</b> <b>time</b> for murder.|$|R

25|$|Mattock turned {{herself in}} to police in September 2014 {{on charges of}} using the {{proceeds}} of crime to achieve her $250,000 bail. She decided not to re-post bail {{in the hopes of}} receiving a quicker trial date. On December 18, 2014, Mattock pleaded guilty to two counts of money laundering and received a 33-month sentence, less time served. As a result of this plea, she will not have to <b>serve</b> <b>time</b> in a federal penitentiary, and she will likely be released in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{stepping}} down when President Menem left office in 1999, financial transactions {{in her name}} totaling over US$200 million came under scrutiny, and Alsogaray was ultimately convicted of {{misappropriation of public funds}} in 2004. She was sentenced to three years in prison and served 21 months, thus becoming the only Menem administration official to <b>serve</b> <b>time</b> in prison.

25|$|In Mauritania, {{the last}} country to abolish slavery (in 1981), it is {{estimated}} that up to 600,000 men, women and children, or 20% of the population, are enslaved with many used as bonded labour. Slavery in Mauritania was criminalized in August 2007. (although slavery as a practice was legally banned in 1981, it was not a crime to own a slave until 2007). Although many slaves have escaped or have been freed since 2007, , only one slave-owner had been sentenced to <b>serve</b> <b>time</b> in prison.|$|E

There is no parole in the Federal Prison System, and under federal rules Blagojevich will serve at least 85 percent, or 12 years, of his sentence after {{which time he}} may be eligible for early release in May 2024 based on good behavior. He is the fourth Illinois governor to <b>serve</b> <b>time</b> in federal prison, after Otto Kerner Jr., Dan Walker, and George Ryan.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year Indiana Attorney General Arthur Gilliom arrested Edward Shumaker, {{the leader of}} the Indiana Anti-Saloon League. He charged Shumaker with contempt of court because of newsletters he was circulating that attacked the Supreme Court of Indiana; he criticized them for what he viewed as lax enforcement of prohibition laws. He was convicted and sentenced to <b>serve</b> <b>time</b> on the Indiana work farm. As Shumaker was a Klan member and leader of a key Republican support group, Jackson pardoned him. Gilliom took the pardon to court and had the pardon overturned by the Supreme Court. Shumaker was required to serve his term.|$|E

25|$|In 1976, Deborah Gardner {{was found}} murdered {{in her home}} in Tonga, where she was serving in the Peace Corps. Dennis Priven, a fellow Peace Corps worker, was later charged with the murder by the Tonga government. He {{was found not guilty}} by reason of insanity, and was sentenced to <b>serve</b> <b>time</b> in a mental {{institution}} in Washington D.C. Privan was never admitted to any institution, and the handling of the case has been heavily criticized. The main criticism has been that the Peace Corps seemingly worked to keep one of its volunteers from being found guilty of murder, due to the reflection it would have on the organization.|$|E
25|$|Through bribes and threats, he {{eventually}} {{managed to get}} a permission to go to Slovenia for himself and twenty close companions. From there the group moved through Austria and Germany before finally relocating to Liège, Belgium. Although Prazina settled himself and his followers in a neighborhood populated mostly by immigrants from Turkey and the Maghreb, {{he eventually}} established himself among the city's small Yugoslav emigrant community. There, Prazina was last seen the night of 3 December 1993. He went out with his bodyguards after a game of cards and never came back. The next morning, German police found his Audi abandoned at the railroad station in Aachen. The car body had two bullet holes from a 9mm handgun; presumed to be a Beretta. Prazina's body was discovered in a canal alongside a highway near the German border by two Romanian hitch-hikers on New Year's Eve. The bullets found in Prazina's head corresponded to the holes in his car, and the ownership of a Beretta by one of his bodyguards sealed the case in the eyes of Belgian police. The four bodyguards were arrested, and three of them went on to be tried and sentenced to <b>serve</b> <b>time</b> in prison.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} the first to feature Alfre Woodard and Mehcad Brooks as series regulars after they were {{introduced}} in the final two episodes of the first season. Woodard played Betty Applewhite, a [...] "deeply religious, overbearing single mother" [...] while Mehcad portrayed her son, Matthew. In regards to the characters and their mystery storyline, Cherry stated: [...] "They come on the street; they seem like nice people—but they've got a secret. And it's pretty gothic. It's real and human and awful all at the same time." [...] Woodard commented that her character [...] "never means harm... Let's just say she has flaws. She had to make some really tough decisions quick and if the law ever catches up with her, she'll have to <b>serve</b> <b>time...</b> But they'll never catch her." [...] The final scene in which Betty and Matthew bring food to the prisoner in their basement was originally intended for the first season finale but saved for [...] "Next" [...] instead.|$|E

40|$|Interviews were {{conducted}} with 11 Canadian federally sentenced women to explore the process of returning to society after incarceration. Three interrelated categories of experience emerged: <b>serving</b> <b>time</b> in prison; meeting basic needs; and <b>serving</b> <b>time</b> in the community. Respondents made long-term use of resources that were available when <b>serving</b> <b>time</b> inside but also indicated lasting pains of incarceration. Upon release, meeting basic needs relating to health, income, housing, and relationships was exceptionally difficult for many women. <b>Serving</b> <b>time</b> in the community, despite some benefit, was mostly characterized {{by a lack of}} support and excessive surveillance and demands. Overall, respondents demonstrated resourcefulness after prison, but the problems they experienced posed major barriers largely beyond their control. Using a feminist lens, emphasis is placed on the need to address the inequitable social and material conditions that contribute to many women’s criminalization and that are often intensified by the pains of release...|$|R
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1977, Nelson {{discovered}} that Reshen had been filing tax extensions and not paying the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) since he took over as his manager. In June, a package containing cocaine was sent from Reshen's office in New York to Jennings in Nashville. The package {{was followed by the}} DEA, and Jennings was arrested. The charges were later dropped, since Reshen's assistant, Mark Rothbaum stepped in and took the charges. Rothbaum was sentenced to <b>serve</b> <b>time</b> in jail. Impressed by his attitude, Nelson fired Reshen and hired Rothbaum as his manager. In 1978, Nelson released two more platinum albums. One, Waylon & Willie, was a collaboration with Jennings that included [...] "Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys", a hit single written and performed by Ed Bruce. Though observers predicted that Stardust would ruin his career, it went platinum the same year. Nelson continued to top the charts with hit songs during the late 1970s, including [...] "Good Hearted Woman", [...] "Remember Me", [...] "If You've Got the Money I've Got the Time", and [...] "Uncloudy Day".|$|E
500|$|The {{first year}} in his new job as {{administrative}} dean at Louisiana State went smoothly. The Middletons had a new house built on Highland Road near the campus, and an oil field was discovered under their property, bringing them royalties that would pay for their property many times over. University enrollment began to climb in 1938 and the LSU football team had just finished three outstanding seasons under coach Bernie Moore, winning 27 of their 30 regular season games. Middleton was photographed breaking ground for a new faculty club that year, as the campus grew in many areas. [...] All seemed to be running well when in June 1939 the campus was given a shock from which it would take many years to recover. A New Orleans newspaper ran a photo {{on the front page}} showing an LSU truck unloading building materials in suburban New Orleans, revealing an illegal operation. The ensuing investigation led to the discovery that LSU's President Smith had embezzled nearly a million dollars from the university, using the money to cover his losses while speculating in the Chicago wheat futures market. Smith stood trial, and was sent to the penitentiary in Angola. [...] The LSU superintendent of grounds and buildings, George Caldwell, was also involved in the scandal and served time in Atlanta for tax evasion. Meanwhile, the state's governor, Richard Leche, resigned, but was soon found guilty of several federal charges and sent to Atlanta to <b>serve</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Black's {{ability to}} {{re-enter}} Canada is uncertain unless he obtains dispensation from the Canadian government. Were he to regain residency, [...] "Canadian citizenship can't be granted {{to those who}} are criminally inadmissible and neither the minister nor the Governor in Council (cabinet) can override that," [...] according to an immigration department spokesperson. The loss of his Canadian citizenship also makes it impossible for Black to be transferred to a Canadian prison where he would be eligible for parole much sooner than if he were to <b>serve</b> <b>time</b> in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|The bout {{is played}} in two periods of 30 minutes. Point scoring occurs during [...] "jams": plays that {{last up to}} two minutes. During a jam, points are scored when a jammer on a scoring pass (every pass a jammer makes through the pack after the initial pass) laps members of the {{opposing}} team. Each team's blockers use body contact, changing positions, and other tactics to assist its jammer to score while hindering the opposing team's jammer. Certain types of blocks and other play are violations; referees call penalties and require violators to <b>serve</b> <b>time</b> in a penalty box.|$|E
2500|$|Unfortunately for Broome, {{he was the}} {{guarantor}} for the Society's debts.

By June of 1826 he was free from the prison as his colleagues Richard Martin and Lewis Gompertz raised funds to cover the unpaid debts. The Society's activities were reduced as the raising of revenue became a primary concern. In 1827 Broome sought to galvanize interest in the Society's work by proposing an annual lecture opposing cruelty in Liverpool.|$|E
