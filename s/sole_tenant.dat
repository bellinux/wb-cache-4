25|$|After Eastern's {{shutdown}} in 1991 it {{was used}} {{by a variety of}} European and Latin American airlines; by the 2000s (decade), American Airlines was its <b>sole</b> <b>tenant.</b> The concourse was closed in 2004 and torn down the following year as part of the North Terminal Development project. The immigration and customs hall remained open until 2007, when it was closed along with Concourse A.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, then FleetBoston Financial, (then {{the current}} owner) was {{acquired}} by Bank of America; and the building {{became known as the}} Bank of America Building. In 2008, shortly before the Great Recession in the United States, the building was purchased by High Rock Development of Massachusetts for $33.2 million. Bank of America was the building's <b>sole</b> <b>tenant,</b> and utilized about half the building. Bank of America invested $7 million in a new sprinkler and fire safety system.|$|E
50|$|When {{the line}} of Waldeck died out in 1553 {{with the death of}} Philipp Melchior, the Breidbach zu Bürresheim family, {{previously}} co-tenants, became <b>sole</b> <b>tenants</b> of Sooneck Castle. When that family became extinct, the castle began to fall into disrepair.|$|R
50|$|In 1905 (or 1906) Stockport Rugby Club {{appears to}} have folded, leaving Stockport County the sole user of the <b>sole</b> <b>tenants</b> of the ground. Edgeley Park has been County's home ever since, and the centenary of the ground was celebrated in 2002.|$|R
50|$|The team plays home matches at a minor pitch at the Stadium Lille Metropole in Villeneuve-d'Ascq.

25|$|The Domestic Terminal is on {{the western}} side of the airport. It is divided into two sidesTerminal South and Terminal Northfor ticketing, check-in, and baggage claim. Delta is the <b>sole</b> <b>tenant</b> of Terminal South, while all other {{domestic}} airlines are located at Terminal North. The portion of the building between Terminal North and Terminal South includes the Atrium, which is a large, open seating area featuring concessionaires, a bank, conference rooms, an interfaith chapel and offices on the upper floors with the main security checkpoint, the Ground Transportation Center and a MARTA station on other levels.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the demise}} of Eastern Air Lines in 1991 the {{concourse}} was used {{by a variety of}} African and Latin American carriers. Many of these airlines' flights would arrive at Concourse B and then be towed to Concourse C for departure. By the end of the decade, the construction of American's baggage sorting facility between Concourses C and D saw the closure of all gates {{on the west side of}} the concourse, with Gate C1 following soon afterward. From the 2000s (decade) on, the concourse consisted of just four domestic-only gates, each of which were capable of accommodating small-to-medium jet aircraft from the Boeing 737 up to the Airbus A300, and American was its <b>sole</b> <b>tenant.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1981, {{the company}} moved its {{headquarters}} 50 {{miles north of}} New York City to Wilton, Connecticut, and in the late 1990s it moved to a larger office space on a corporate campus in Westport, Connecticut. As the company continued to expand, it became the <b>sole</b> <b>tenant</b> at the 22-acre campus. The firm's headquarters is described as retreat-like and is surrounded by the trees of a former nature reserve. The campus contains three buildings made of [...] "midcentury modern fieldstone and glass". Since 2000 its staff has grown from 100 to 1200 employees, and the firm has taken office space in three additional buildings in the area. In an effort to consolidate its offices, the company made {{plans to build a}} 750,000 square foot headquarters in Stamford, CT about 15 miles from its present location in Westport, but cancelled the project in 2014.|$|E
50|$|In October 2008, União {{moved back}} to their spiritual home at the Campo do Adelino Rodrigues {{in the heart of}} the city centre, leaving Marítimo as Barreiros' <b>sole</b> <b>tenants</b> and paving the way for {{complete}} redevelopment of the new stadium. Work began on the new stadium on July 20, 2009, with the realigning of the pitch and demolition of the Bancada Nascente, reducing the capacity to 5,000 seats. The stadium will have a capacity of 10,932 seats and will be completed by December 2016.|$|R
50|$|The two {{professional}} Munich football clubs FC Bayern Munich and TSV 1860 Munich {{had played}} their home {{games at the}} Allianz Arena {{since the start of}} the 2005-06 season. The clubs had previously played their home games at the Munich Olympic Stadium since 1972. 1860 Munich previously had a 50% share in the stadium, but Bayern Munich purchased their shares for €11 million in April 2006. The arrangement allowed 1860 Munich to play at the stadium while retaining no ownership until 2025. However, in July 2017 the rental contract was terminated, making Bayern Munich the <b>sole</b> <b>tenants</b> of the stadium.|$|R

2500|$|In 2012, Bank of America, {{still the}} [...] "Superman Building"'s <b>sole</b> <b>tenant,</b> {{decided not to}} renew its lease. The bank vacated the building, leaving it empty. High Rock 's {{requests}} for public funds to redevelop the building were turned down.

60|$|The {{days had}} become alike in sadness to Stephen. Richter gone, and the Judge often away in mysterious conference, {{he was left}} {{for hours at a}} spell the <b>sole</b> <b>tenant</b> of the office. Fortunately there was work of Richter's and of Mr. Whipple's left undone that kept him busy. This Thursday morning, however, he found the Judge getting into that best black coat which he wore on occasions. His manner had {{recently}} lost much of its gruffness.|$|E
60|$|Thus, {{since the}} death of our venerable friend, Jack Redburn and I have been the <b>sole</b> <b>tenants</b> of the old house; and, day by day, have lounged {{together}} in his favourite walks. Mindful of his injunctions, we have long been able to speak of him with ease and cheerfulness, and to remember him as he would be remembered. From certain allusions which Jack has dropped, to his having been deserted and cast off in early life, I am inclined to believe that some passages of his youth may possibly be shadowed out in the history of Mr. Chester and his son, but seeing that he avoids the subject, I have not pursued it.|$|R
50|$|The Red Wings {{moved from}} Silver Stadium to Frontier Field at the {{conclusion}} of the 1996 International League season. Currently, the Red Wings are the <b>sole</b> full-time <b>tenant</b> at Frontier Field and thus the stadium is now used exclusively for baseball and special events.|$|R

60|$|It {{makes me}} smile, {{at such a}} time as this, to think if there were any one to see me sitting in my easy-chair, my gray head hanging down, my eyes bent thoughtfully upon the glowing embers, and my crutch - emblem of my {{helplessness}} - lying upon the hearth at my feet, how solitary I should seem. Yet though I am the <b>sole</b> <b>tenant</b> of this chimney-corner, though I am childless and old, I have no sense of loneliness at this hour; but am the centre of a silent group whose company I love.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a wondrous}} sight that now, alas! {{will be seen}} no more--at any rate upon the Transvaal veld; wilderbeeste, blesbok, springbok, in countless multitudes, and amongst them a few quagga and hartebeeste. With a sound like that of thunder, their {{flashing}} myriad hoofs casting up clouds of dust from the fire-blackened veld, the great herds separated at the appearance of their enemy, man. This way and that they went in groups and long brown lines, leaving the wounded and exhausted wilderbeeste behind them, so that presently he was the <b>sole</b> <b>tenant</b> of that great cup of land.|$|E
60|$|Instead {{of sitting}} down, I {{snatched}} my outdoor things, and hastened below, {{for the way}} was free. On entering the house, I looked about for some one to give information of Catherine. The place was filled with sunshine, and the door stood wide open; but nobody seemed at hand. As I hesitated whether to go off at once, or return and seek my mistress, a slight cough drew my attention to the hearth. Linton lay on the settle, <b>sole</b> <b>tenant,</b> sucking a stick of sugar-candy, and pursuing my movements with apathetic eyes. 'Where is Miss Catherine?' I demanded sternly, supposing I could frighten him into giving intelligence, by catching him thus, alone. He sucked on like an innocent.|$|E
50|$|Eastwood Shopping Centre, {{built in}} 1976 {{on the former}} Odeon Theatre and is a 2-storey centre that once {{featured}} Target, Tandy Electronics, BBC Hardware and Woolworths.

50|$|In 1982 the Oakland Raiders left Oakland {{because of}} the city's refusal to upgrade the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, leaving the Oakland Athletics {{baseball}} team as the <b>sole</b> <b>tenants.</b> In 1995, the city made an agreement with Raiders owner Al Davis that they would increase {{the capacity of the}} County Coliseum in exchange for him bringing the Raiders back to Oakland. The result was a structure that became known as Mount Davis after Davis. There was criticism when Mount Davis was built as it obstructed views of the Oakland Hills. It was completed in 1996 but was criticized for being too steep and taking spectators too far away from the field of play. It had been noted to negatively affect baseball as while it provided a shield against the sun for outfielders chasing fly balls, it was an enclosed concrete stadium and had lost capacity for the Athletics.|$|R
5000|$|The {{current status}} of Virgin Galactic, the <b>sole</b> {{prospective}} <b>tenant</b> of the New Mexico Spaceport and its Authority, has led members of the New Mexico legislature to sharply question Executive Director Anderson. After an incident on October 31, 2014, Virgin Galactic indefinitely postponed its planned operational startup date in New Mexico. In November 2014, Anderson requested that the legislature consider creating an supplemental emergency fund to enable the spaceport to maintain its operations, and told lawmakers that the Authority will try to rent out the spaceport for [...] "video shoots or concerts." ...|$|R
60|$|Presumably, being {{altogether}} tired out, Smith did ultimately fall asleep, for {{how long}} he never knew. At any rate, it is certain that, if so, he woke up again. He could not tell the time, because his watch was not a repeater, and the place was as black as the pit. He had some matches in his pocket, and might have struck one and even have lit his pipe. To his credit be it said, however, he remembered {{that he was the}} <b>sole</b> <b>tenant</b> {{of one of the most}} valuable museums in the world, and his responsibilities with reference to fire. So he refrained from striking that match under the keel of a boat which had become very dry in the course of five thousand years.|$|E
60|$|I {{arrived at}} Dorjiling on the 16th of April; a showery, cold month at this elevation. I was so {{fortunate}} as to find Mr. Charles Barnes (brother {{of my friend}} at Colgong), the <b>sole</b> <b>tenant</b> of a long, cottage-like building, divided off into pairs of apartments, which are hired by visitors. It is usual for Europeans to bring a full establishment of servants (with bedding, etc.) to such stations, but I had not done so, having been told {{that there was a}} furnished hotel in Dorjiling; and I was, therefore, not a little indebted to Mr. Barnes for his kind invitation to join his mess. As he was an active mountaineer, we enjoyed many excursions together, in the two months and a half during which we were companions.|$|E
60|$|Thus we now {{presented}} {{ourselves to}} the old man who was the <b>sole</b> <b>tenant</b> of that lonely and squalid house. A ducat opened his door as wide as it would go, and gave us free access to every cranny of his dwelling. Food he procured us--rough black bread, some pieces of roasted goat, and some goat's milk--and on this we regaled ourselves {{as though it had been}} a ducal banquet, for hunger had set us in the mood to account anything delicious. And when we had eaten we fell to talking, the old man having left us to go about such peasant duties as claimed his attention, and our talk concerned ourselves, our future first, and later on our past. I remember that Madonna returned to the matter of the deception that I had practised, seeking to learn what reasons had impelled me, and I answered her in all truth.|$|E
5000|$|On the {{business}} side, the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association (NBA) {{expressed interest in}} moving to Honda Center, the Ducks' home arena. The team had until May 2, 2011, to file for relocation to play in Anaheim for the 2011-12 season. Ducks owners Henry and Susan Samueli {{have been trying to}} lure an NBA team to Honda Center since they purchased the team, mainly due to the prospective positive impact the team would have on the Ducks' finances and the finances of the Samueli family-owned Anaheim Arena Management. It was announced on May 2, however, that the Kings would remain in the city of Sacramento for at least one more season. Even though the Ducks remained the <b>sole</b> <b>tenants</b> of Honda Center at least through to the 2011-12 season, the Anaheim Ducks and Anaheim Arena Management announced that they would be doing a major upgrade to the arena in mid-June 2011. The upgrade is set to include {{the construction of a new}} restaurant, an expanded club area, a grand terrace, a new east entrance and a larger team merchandise store, with the cost of the project reportedly in the tens of millions of dollars. The Ducks also announced ticket prices for individual games would be reduced in order to take advantage of an [...] "all-in" [...] pricing mechanism.|$|R
50|$|Meridian Health Plan Headquarters is a {{proposed}} highrise in the Campus Martius district of downtown Detroit. The skyscraper will rise 16 stories with office space, ground level retail outlets, a state-of-the-art plaza, and a 9 story, 1,000 space parking deck. This {{will be the}} first office building construction in Detroit since the completion of One Kennedy Square in 2006. Detroit-based Meridian Health Plan {{is expected to be the}} <b>sole</b> office <b>tenant</b> in the 16-story building on the block bounded by Monroe, Bates and Farmer streets by Campus Martius Park.

50|$|New Meadowlands Stadium {{opened in}} 2010, {{replacing}} Giants Stadium {{as the home}} of both the New York Giants and the New York Jets. The new stadium is located a few hundred feet away from the old building {{in the parking lot of}} Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Unlike Giants Stadium (in which the Giants were the <b>sole</b> NFL <b>tenant</b> until the 1984 season), the new Meadowlands Stadium will be a 50/50 partnership between both New York teams. The Giants played their first regular season game on September 12 against the Carolina Panthers, while the Jets played the following night against the Baltimore Ravens in the first game of a Monday Night Football doubleheader.|$|R
60|$|What {{was thought}} of this problem, and {{of the man who}} had to work it out, by some of the well-to-do {{inhabitants}} of Shepperton, two years or more after Mr. Barton's arrival among them, you shall hear, if you will accompany me to Cross Farm, and to the fireside of Mrs. Patten, a childless old lady, who had got rich chiefly by the negative process of spending nothing. Mrs. Patten's passive accumulation of wealth, through all sorts of 'bad times', on the farm of which she had been <b>sole</b> <b>tenant</b> since her husband's death, her epigrammatic neighbour, Mrs. Hackit, sarcastically accounted for by supposing that 'sixpences grew on the bents of Cross Farm;' while Mr. Hackit, expressing his views more literally, reminded his wife that 'money breeds money'. Mr. and Mrs. Hackit, from the neighbouring farm, are Mrs. Patten's guests this evening; so is Mr. Pilgrim, the doctor from the nearest market-town, who, though occasionally affecting aristocratic airs, and giving late dinners with enigmatic side-dishes and poisonous port, is never so comfortable as when he is relaxing his professional legs in one of those excellent farmhouses where the mice are sleek and the mistress sickly. And he is at this moment in clover.|$|E

The parking lot and the empty storefronts haven't been maintained in years, leading to a dilapidated state. Even Wendy's closed its location on an out parcel of the property in 2010; the chain is popular {{in the area and}} is fourth behind only Subway, McDonald's, and the locally owned Brighton Hot Dog Shoppe in terms of number of locations in Beaver County.|$|R

Baseball teams of higher level leagues have used RAP in the past with a movable outfield fence. Public pressure during the municipal election resulted in the facility remaining multisport. Soccer has been played at Royal Athletic Park for over a century. As a secondary tenant, the Victoria Highlanders 2013 schedule was front loaded with all but one home game played before the baseball season's third game. The Highlanders reserves and Victoria Highlanders Women home games were moved from RAP to Hampton Park and Tyndall Park respectively.|$|R
