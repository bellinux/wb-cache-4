50|$|There {{are three}} types of {{shrinkage}}: shrinkage of the liquid, <b>solidification</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and patternmaker's shrinkage. The shrinkage of the liquid is rarely a problem because more material is flowing into the mold behind it. <b>Solidification</b> <b>shrinkage</b> occurs because metals are less dense as a liquid than a solid, so during solidification the metal density dramatically increases. Patternmaker's shrinkage refers to the shrinkage that occurs when the material is cooled from the solidification temperature to room temperature, which occurs due to thermal contraction.|$|E

40|$|In {{injection}} molding, a key polymer processing technique, {{the requirements}} of product quality have been significantly increased in the past decade. The product quality highly depends on the processing condition, and this directs {{to the development of}} a capacitive transducer (CT) for process monitoring. Cooling time, which takes up most of the injection cycle time, has critical effects on the quality and productivity of products. Insufficient cooling time leads to inconsistent moldings, while excessive one increases the cost of process. A specifically designed capacitive transducer, which can be described by a basic parallel plate capacitor, was embedded into the mold for monitoring the polymer status inside the mold cavity. The CT output shows a specific pattern during the cooling stage, providing a possible mean for solidification rate monitoring. The characteristic signal pattern can be divided into three phases: (i) <b>solidification</b> without <b>shrinkage,</b> (ii) <b>solidification</b> with <b>shrinkage</b> and (iii) core solidification. By applying the process principles to model the solidification process of polymer, the methods for estimating the solidification rate and the degree of product shrinkage are well analyzed. The results quantitatively monitor the rates of <b>solidification</b> and <b>shrinkage.</b> Also, the end of solidification is detected, such that further control schemes to optimize the cooling time can be achieved. The capacitive transducer is novel concept for product quality monitoring, and model calculations to estimate the solidification is simple and robust...|$|R

50|$|Gray iron also {{experiences}} less <b>solidification</b> <b>shrinkage</b> {{than other}} cast irons {{that do not}} form a graphite microstructure. The silicon promotes good corrosion resistance and increased fluidity when casting. Gray iron is generally considered easy to weld.Compared to the more modern iron alloys, gray iron has a low tensile strength and ductility; therefore, its impact and shock resistance is almost non-existent.|$|E
50|$|Risers, {{also known}} as feeders, {{are the most common}} way of {{providing}} directional solidification. It supplies liquid metal to the solidifying casting to compensate for <b>solidification</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> For a riser to work properly the riser must solidify after the casting, otherwise it cannot supply liquid metal to shrinkage within the casting. Risers add cost to the casting because it lowers the yield of each casting; i.e. more metal is lost as scrap for each casting. Another way to promote directional solidification is by adding chills to the mold. A chill is any material which will conduct heat away from the casting more rapidly than the material used for molding.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{one of the}} {{benefits}} of spray forming is purportedly the ability to produce bulk material with fine scale microsegregation and little or no macrosegregation work on Al-Mg-Li-Cu alloys showed that as a consequence of the interconnected liquid in the billet there was significant macrosegregation in large spray formed wrought Al billets. The distribution of Cu, Mg and Li in, for example, Al alloy 8091 showed surprisingly pronounced macrosegregation with the variation of Cu(wt%) in a spray formed 8091 billet, ranging from approximately 1.4 at the billet centre to 1.92 at the billet periphery. These macrosegregation patterns were explained in terms of inverse segregation in which solute rich liquid from the billet centre is sucked back through the primary Al-rich network to feed <b>solidification</b> <b>shrinkage</b> at the billet periphery. This effect was suggested to be exacerbated by centrifugal effects from the billet rotation.|$|E
50|$|Shrinkage can {{again be}} {{classified}} into liquid shrinkage and solid shrinkage.

The gating system of the casting is optimized according to the simulation results. Results show that when the gating system consists of only one sprue, the filling of the molten metal is not stable; and the casting does not follow the sequence <b>solidification,</b> and many <b>shrinkage</b> porosities are observed through the casting. After the gating system is improved by adding one runner and two in-gates, the filling time is prolonged from 4. 0 s to 4. 5 s, the filling of molten metal becomes stable, but this casting does not follow the sequence <b>solidification</b> either. Some <b>shrinkage</b> porosity is also observed in the hot spots of the casting. When the gating system was further improved by adding risers and chill to the hot spots of the casting, the shrinkage porosity defects were eliminated completely.

50|$|The , {{also known}} as the , uses a mixture of {{refractory}} aggregate, hydrolyzed ethyl silicate, alcohol, and a gelling agent to create a mold. This slurry mixture is poured into a slightly tapered flask and a reusable pattern (i.e. the item used to create the shape of the mold) is used. The slurry hardens almost immediately to a rubbery state (the consistency of vulcanized rubber). The flask and pattern is then removed. Then a torch is used to ignite the mold, which causes most of the volatiles to burn-off and the formation of ceramic microcrazes (microscopic cracks). These cracks are important, because they allow gases to escape while preventing the metal from flowing through; they also ease thermal expansion and contraction during <b>solidification</b> and <b>shrinkage.</b> After the burn-off, the mold is baked at 1800 F to remove any remaining volatiles. Prior to pouring metal, the mold is pre-warmed to control shrinkage.|$|R
50|$|Porosity {{resulting}} from gas entrapment and <b>solidification</b> <b>shrinkage</b> {{is a significant}} problem in spray formed materials. A typical spray formed billet will contain 1-2% porosity with a pore size dependent on alloy freezing range and various process parameters. Hot isostatic pressing (HIPing) or thermo-mechanical processing can heal these pores if they are small (less than 30 µm). Despite these disadvantages, spray forming remains an economic process {{for the production of}} difficult to manufacture, niche alloys. Large-scale porosity is more difficult to heal effectively and must be minimised by careful process control. In some cases, porosity is controlled by alloy additions which react with dissolved and entrapped gas to form a solid phase e.g. titanium added to copper billets to form titanium nitride with dissolved and entrapped nitrogen gas. Porosity, even after consolidation, can limit the applications of spray formed material, for example rotating gas turbine components must have zero porosity because of the detrimental effect on high-cycle fatigue (HCF).|$|E
50|$|Magnesium alloys, {{especially}} {{precipitation hardened}} alloys, {{are used in}} casting. Sand, permanent mold and die casting methods are used, but plaster-of-Paris casting {{has not yet been}} perfected. Sand casting in green-sand molds requires a special technique, because the magnesium reacts with moisture in the sand, forming magnesium oxide and liberating hydrogen. The oxide forms blackened areas called burns {{on the surface of the}} casting, and the liberated hydrogen may cause porosity. Inhibitors such as sulfur, boric acid, ethylene glycol, or ammonium fluoride are mixed with the damp sand to prevent the reaction. All gravity-fed molds require an extra high column of molten metal to make the pressure great enough to force gas bubbles out of the casting and make the metal take the detail of the mold. The thickness of the casting wall should be at least 5/32 in. under most conditions. Extra-large fillets must be provided at all re-entrant corners, since stress concentration in magnesium castings are particularly dangerous.Permanent mold castings are made from the same alloys and have about the same physical properties as sand castings. Since the <b>solidification</b> <b>shrinkage</b> of magnesium is about the same as that of aluminium, aluminium molds can often be adapted to make magnesium-alloy castings (although it may be necessary to change the gating).Pressure cold-chamber castings are used for quantity production of small parts. The rapid solidification caused by contact of the fluid metal with the cold die produces a casting of dense structure with excellent physical properties. The finish and dimensional accuracy are very good, and machining is necessary only where extreme accuracy is required. Usually these castings are not heat treated.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the castability, alloy <b>solidification</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and the riser design in particular, of low thermal expansion (LTE) cast irons with relatively low C and Si content (< 2. 0 %). The solidification temperatures as well as the <b>solidification</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and solid contraction were analyzed, and also the riser design was performed in this work. Thermal analyses results indicate that the alloy liquidus temperatures are closely related with the CE value. In addition, the amounts of <b>solidification</b> <b>shrinkage</b> were measured to be around 5 % for 1 %C- 1 %Si- 35 %Ni FG irons, and around 6. 5 % for SG irons of similar compositions, with a difference of some 1. 5 %. Furthermore, the percent <b>solidification</b> <b>shrinkage</b> decreases as the Co content increases from nil to 6 % at a constant NiE, with a 0. 35 % reduction for each 1 % Co substitution for an equivalent amount of Ni.

40|$|Abstract]: Composites {{made from}} vinyl ester resins suffer {{considerable}} shrinkage during curing and after <b>solidification.</b> This <b>shrinkage</b> is particularly serious if the fibre composite components {{are large and}} can be up to twelve percent (Schwartz, 1992; Clarke, 1996; Matthews and Rawlings, 1994). Currently, the shrinkage problem is solved by breaking a large composite component into smaller composite parts because smaller parts tend to have less shrinkage. These smaller parts are then joined together to form the overall structure. However, the manufacturing lead-time and costs of a composite component are significantly increased. This project attempts to reduce the shrinkage of the components cast from uncured 33 % by weight or 44 % by volume of fly ash particulate-reinforced vinyl esters [VE/FLYASH (33 %) ]. This is accomplished by shortening the curing time of the resins using penetrating microwave energy. The formation of pinholes in the samples resulted in {{the expansion of the}} volume of the materials in the initial stage of the curing process.

40|$|Low Pressure Die Casting (LPDC) {{process is}} one {{the most common}} casting process to produce {{structural}} automotive components, such as alloy wheels and suspension components. It has been identified that cavity filling and solidification process are two most critical aspects to produce premium quality casting components. During the solidification process of casting alloy, it is a well known phenomenon that metal experiences volumetric shrinkage due to its density difference between liquid and solid phase. When this volumetric shrinkage is not properly compensated, then a casting defect commonly known as <b>solidification</b> <b>shrinkage</b> occurs. The <b>solidification</b> <b>shrinkage</b> has very detrimental effects on structural integrity required for premium quality casting such as aluminium alloy wheels. Literature and practical experiences of foundry men show that {{it is critical to}} achieve unidirectional solidification pattern by avoiding an isolated hot spot in order to minimise the <b>solidification</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> However, it is found that the geometry of industrial casting applications is often constrained by other design factors that would not naturally avoid these isolated hot spots. The subject of this research, aluminium alloy wheels, is not excluded from this constraint. In aluminium alloy wheels, an isolated hot spot is commonly observed in an area known as rim and spoke junction due to its geometry constraints. Consequently, the <b>solidification</b> <b>shrinkage</b> is commonly experienced, which is undesirable due to its detrimental effects for the structural integrity of alloy wheels. In order to minimise the <b>solidification</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> forced cooling method is applied to avoid an isolated hot spot. The control of this forced cooling is achieved by cooling media, flow rate of cooling media and duration cooling circuit. Foundry experiments in industrial environment were conducted producing aluminium alloy wheels using commercially treated A 356 (Al-Si) alloy, where different durations of cooling circuit were used to understand the sensitivity of <b>solidification</b> <b>shrinkage</b> formation to the duration of cooling circuit. This was followed by metallurgical structure analysis and numerical modelling to suggest the sensitivity of cooling circuit duration in controlling <b>solidification</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> The major finding conclusion of this research is that control of the shrinkage formation is not very sensitive to the duration cooling circuit. It is suggested that as casting solidifies initially from the mould wall, it retracts away from the cast-mould interface due to thermal contraction. Consequently, air gap is formed between casting and mould interface, creating an effective thermal resistance layer. Thereafter, heat transfer across the cast-mould interface is not sensitive to the change in the cooling channel which is a distance to the cast-mould interface. Some limitations of numerical modelling and metallurgical analysis were also identified during this research and recommendations were made to improve the accuracy of local hot spot prediction in production of aluminium alloy wheels. More specifically, numerical modelling of the effect of grain refinement and use of non homogeneous material property (particularly fraction of solid) for rapidly chilled area.

Owing to the {{difficulties}} in the procurement of internationally certified reference materials for iron and steel, local firms are using their own standards manufactured by casting techniques. It is necessary to assess the integrity of these materials using international standards as control to these in-house reference materials. Macro and micro-examination were carried out to reveal the nature of reference materials and hence evaluate their quality. The consistency of chemical composition of standard materials and {{the accuracy of the}} analyses based on the in-house standards were evaluated. The results showed that local standards were characterised by gross casting defects. In comparison the imported standards had micro-structural uniformity and free from casting defects. This shows the essential difference in production method. Casting has severe limitations {{when it comes to the}} production of components of low segregation and internal soundness. First, the partitioning of solutes between solid and liquid phases invariably leads to segregation and loss of homogeneity. Second, the volumetric change accompanying <b>solidification</b> results in <b>shrinkage</b> cavities. If stringent production controls are not observed, the proprietary standards are bound to have a widely varying chemical composition. In this regard, the calibration and standardisation would essentially be flawed. Hence the subsequent chemical analyses of standards cannot be reliable. It is necessary to establish an analytical methodology that yields reliable results. Standards used for calibration should have a high degree of chemical purity and homogeneity. The study covers other possible production options for standards that can be used for accurate calibration and standardisation of spectrometers for chemical analysis of iron and steel.

The first criterion is used when the fraction eutectic is important : then the porosity formation is essentially caused by dissolved gases of formed during chemical reactions.
