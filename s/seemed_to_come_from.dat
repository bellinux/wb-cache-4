25|$|As {{part of the}} Protestant Reformation, theologians {{turned away}} from the traditions {{developed}} in the Middle Ages and returned to biblical and early church sources. Accordingly, they were often skeptical of Catholic mystical practices, which seemed to them to downplay the role of grace in redemption and to support the idea that human works can play a role in salvation, and which also <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> post-biblical sources and practices. Thus, Protestant theology developed a strong critical attitude, oftentimes even an animosity towards Christian mysticism. However, Quakers, Anglicans, Methodists, Episcopalians, Lutherans, Local Churches, Pentecostals and Charismatics have in various ways remained open to the idea of mystical experiences.|$|E
500|$|Staci Layne Wilson of Horror.com {{also felt}} {{the film was}} full of stereotypes, {{including}} a [...] "stupid circus trainer; bible-thumping naysayer; the great white hunter; small-minded mayor; pinheaded press; wise Indian sage; [...] military sorts" [...] but felt they were depicted in such an extreme manner that they were simply boring. She found the films conclusion to be predictable and [...] "corny". She did praise the film's cinematography and visual appeal despite {{the limited number of}} filming locations actually used. In reviewing the film for DVD Talk, film instructor and critic Justin Felix found the use of a real tiger one of the only original elements of the film, while feeling the plot, setting, and characters followed the set Sci Fi Channel movie of the week formula. At the same time, he notes that the use of a live tiger results in most attacks occurring off screen and the tiger being rarely seen at all, taking away the [...] "usual" [...] fun of laughing at badly done [...] "CG terrors." [...] Monsters and Critics.coms Jeff Swindoll felt the film was a poor attempt at replicating Jaws with the tiger taking on the role of a [...] "land shark." [...] While he felt the character of Colonel Graham was contrived and <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> another era, Swindoll did think Ian D. Clark did portray the character decently. Like other critics, Swindoll praised the use of a live tiger, but also notes that it was obvious the tiger was playing with the actors like a [...] "sweet pussycat" [...] and that the post-production editing did a bad job of trying {{to make it look like}} the tiger was a vicious killer.|$|E
500|$|Hendrix {{disliked the}} UK cover of Are You Experienced, so {{arrangements}} {{were made for}} a photo shoot with graphic designer Karl Ferris. Hendrix wanted [...] "something psychedelic", so he requested Ferris because he appreciated the photographer's sleeve-work on the Hollies' June 1967 release Evolution. During {{a meeting with the}} band, Ferris told Hendrix that he wanted to hear more of their music from which to draw inspiration. They accommodated his request by allowing him to attend several sessions for their second album, Axis: Bold as Love. Ferris brought home tapes from the sessions, which along with Are You Experienced he listened to intently. His first impression of the music was that it was [...] "so far out that it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> outer space", which inspired him to develop a backstory about a [...] "group travelling through space in a Biosphere on their way to bring their unworldly space music to earth." [...] With this concept in mind, he took color photographs of the band at Kew Gardens in London, using a fisheye lens which was then popular in Mod sub-culture. Ferris used what Egan described as [...] "an infrared technique of his own invention which combined color reversal with heat signature", further enhancing the exotic nature of the image. Ferris was an experienced fashion photographer, and his interest in the finer details of his covers led him to choose the band's wardrobe. After seeing Hendrix with his hair combed away from the scalp, Ferris requested that he wear it that way during the photo shoot. Hendrix's girlfriend, Kathy Etchingham, trimmed his hair to improve its symmetry, forming an afro that became the basis of a homogenized Experience image. Redding and Mitchell liked Hendrix's new hairstyle, so Ferris hired a hairdresser to style their hair in a similar fashion. After purchasing clothing for Redding and Mitchell at the boutiques on King's Road—Hendrix wore clothes from his wardrobe, including a psychedelic jacket with a pair of eyes printed on the front which had been given to him by a fan—the Experience travelled to Kew Gardens. In an effort to focus on Hendrix's hands, Ferris shot the band at a low angle. The daylight faded soon after their arrival at the garden, so they returned the following day for a second shoot, which was not needed; the image selected for the US cover of Are You Experienced was the first shot taken the previous day. Ferris chose the cover's yellow background and its surreal lettering, and he intended for a textured gatefold jacket that Reprise, as a cost-saving measure, did not approve.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding Callas's soft singing, Celletti says, [...] "In these soft passages, Callas {{seemed to}} use another voice altogether, because it {{acquired}} a great sweetness. Whether in her florid singing or in her canto spianato, that is, in long held notes without ornamentation, her mezza-voce could achieve such moving sweetness {{that the sound}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> on high...

2500|$|Before the {{introduction}} of Fermi–Dirac statistics in 1926, understanding some aspects of electron behavior were difficult due to seemingly contradictory phenomena.

[...] It was also difficult to understand why those emission currents generated by applying high electric fields to metals at room temperature were almost independent of temperature.|$|E
2500|$|During a {{counter-insurgency}} seminar {{conducted by}} Sri Lanka Army in June 2011, Lawrence Smith - an attaché of the American embassy in Sri Lanka from 2008 revealed [...] "...from what I was privileged {{to hear and}} to see, the offers to surrender that I am aware of <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the mouthpieces of the LTTE -- Nadesan, KP -- people who weren't and never had really demonstrated any control over the leadership or the combat power of the LTTE. So their offers were a bit suspect anyway, and they tended to vary in content hour by hour, day by day. I {{think we need to}} examine the credibility of those offers before we leap to conclusions that such offers were in fact real..." [...] However the US State Department characterized the statement as [...] "personal opinion".|$|E

2500|$|Prior to {{the attack}} on FSB Mary Ann, there had been reports of {{possible}} Viet Cong infiltration within {{the ranks of the}} ARVN contingent present on Mary Ann. In one incident, a man wearing the insignia of an ARVN lieutenant inquired about the easiest way to get off the firebase because his men wanted to go fishing. He was told the easiest way {{in and out of the}} camp was the south end of the firebase. During the battle, some of the enemy gunfire <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>from</b> the ARVN section of the camp. However, one US soldier who was wounded and remained in the ARVN sector for the duration of the fight stated later that he never saw any ARVN firing toward US positions. The ARVN battery was located in the northern sector of the FSB, which was not attacked by the sappers, and this may in part account for their inaction. The 23rd ID's Inspector General (IG) team noted that the northeastern side of the base was [...] "generally untouched, including the Battalion ammunition storage area. The actions of ARVN soldiers were no different from many US soldiers in taking cover until the attack was over." [...] The ARVN decided not to garrison the firebase after the attack and it was closed on 24 April.|$|E
