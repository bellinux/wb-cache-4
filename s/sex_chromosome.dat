25|$|The term <b>sex</b> <b>chromosome</b> {{aneuploidy}} summarizes {{conditions with}} an abnormal number of sex chromosomes, i.e. other than XX (female) or XY (male). Formally, X chromosome monosomy (Turner syndrome, see above) {{can also be}} classified {{as a form of}} <b>sex</b> <b>chromosome</b> aneuploidy.|$|E
25|$|Males {{with certain}} <b>sex</b> <b>chromosome</b> genetic conditions, such as Klinefelter's syndrome, {{will have a}} higher level of estradiol.|$|E
25|$|Other {{numerical}} abnormalities discovered include <b>sex</b> <b>chromosome</b> abnormalities. A female {{with only}} one Xchromosome has Turner syndrome, whereas an additional Xchromosome in a male, resulting in 47 total chromosomes, has Klinefelter Syndrome. Many other <b>sex</b> <b>chromosome</b> combinations are compatible with live birth including XXX, XYY, and XXXX. The ability for mammals to tolerate aneuploidies in the sex chromosomes arises from the ability to inactivate them, which is required in normal females to compensate for having two copies of the chromosome. Not all genes on the Xchromosome are inactivated, which is why there is a phenotypic effect seen in individuals with extra Xchromosomes.|$|E
40|$|Arvicolid rodents present both {{synaptic}} and asynaptic <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> We {{analyzed the}} pairing behaviour of <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in two species belonging to this rodent group (Microtus ni�alis and Ar�icola sapidus). At pachynema, the <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> of both species paired {{in a small}} region while the rest remain unsynapsed. Consequently at metaphase I, <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> present end-to-end association. Thus, the pairing behaviour of <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in these species {{is very similar to}} that previously described for other arvicolid rodents and for most mammals. According to this, we propose that synaptic <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> were the ancestral condition in the family Arvicolidae, including the genus Microtus. The phylogenetic origin of the asynaptic <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in the genus Microtus would have arisen once in the lineage that originated the species M. ar�alis/agrestis and related species, while the lineage that originated the species M. oeconomous and related species conserved synaptic chromosomes. Furthermore, the phylogenetic relationships between the genus Microtus, Chionomys and Pitymys are discussed in relation to the synaptic behaviour of <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Evolution of <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> and karyotypes in iguanas (Squamata: Pleurodonta) PhD Thesis Marie Altmanová Abstract This PhD {{thesis is}} {{composed}} of five published articles and one manuscript, and {{is focused on the}} evolution of the <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> and karyotype of the iguanas (Pleurodonta). Based on our primary research of available data, only male heterogamety (XX/XY) with ancestral karyotype 2 n = 36 chromosomes was recorded in iguanas. However, in many species <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> have not been uncovered by classical cytogenetics, probably due to their homomorphy. The partially-known X chromosome content of Anolis carolinensis allowed us to compare the relative gene doses of X-specific genes between male and female of representatives of all iguana families, and to reveal homologous and well-differentiated <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> across all iguanas, with the exception of basilisks. Thus, due to the comparable age with <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> of mammals and birds, the results put into question the importance of endothermy for the formation of stable <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> The striking feature of the iguanas is the relatively frequent occurrence of multiple <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in their karyotypes. Using the ancestral state analysis of the type of <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> it has been found that these multiple <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> developed at least twelve [...] ...|$|R

25|$|This {{results when}} each of a female's cells has one normal X {{chromosome}} {{and the other}} <b>sex</b> <b>chromosome</b> is missing or altered. The missing genetic material affects development and causes {{the features of the}} condition, including short stature and infertility.|$|E
25|$|The female’s mating {{preference}} is inherited paternally since the preference gene or genes lie mostly or {{exclusively on the}} Z <b>sex</b> <b>chromosome.</b> The preferred male trait and the female preference for the trait are strongly correlated; females with larger fathers have a stronger preference for larger males.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, Y {{chromosome}} {{is present}} {{as a single}} <b>sex</b> <b>chromosome</b> in the male individual and is passed on to male descendants without recombination.

40|$|Dispatchautosomal {{segments}} to the <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> Importantly, {{the origin}} of the avian <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> as it can be estimated by applying a molecular clock to the divergence between non-recombining Z- and W-linked gametologs, is at approximately 130 – 150 million years ago [19]. This does not affect the dating of the eutherian <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> but it shows that the Z and W of birds, as the eutherian X and Y, evolved long after the split of synapsids and diapsids 310 million years ago.

5000|$|At {{least one}} monotreme, the platypus, {{presents}} a particular sex determination scheme {{that in some}} ways resembles that of the ZW <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> of birds and lacks the SRY gene. The platypus has ten sex chromosomes; males have an XYXYXYXYXY pattern while females have ten X chromosomes. Although it is an XY system, the platypus' <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> share no homologues with eutherian <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> Instead, homologues with eutherian <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> lie on the platypus chromosome 6, which means that the eutherian <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> were autosomes {{at the time that the}} monotremes diverged from the therian mammals (marsupials and eutherian mammals). However, homologues to the avian DMRT1 gene on platypus <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> X3 and X5 suggest that it is possible the sex-determining gene for the platypus is the same one that is involved in bird sex-determination.

25|$|Trisomy X {{is a form}} of <b>sex</b> <b>chromosome</b> {{aneuploidy}} where {{females have}} three instead of two X chromosomes. Most patients are only mildly affected by neuropsychological and physical symptoms. Studies examining the origin of the extra X chromosome observed that about 58-63% of cases were caused by nondisjunction in maternal meiosis I, 16-18% by nondisjunction in maternal meiosis II, and the remaining cases by post-zygotic, i.e. mitotic, nondisjunction.|$|E
25|$|In genetic sex-determination systems, an organism's sex is {{determined}} by the genome it inherits. Genetic sex-determination usually depends on asymmetrically inherited sex chromosomes which carry genetic features that influence development; sex may be determined either by the presence of a <b>sex</b> <b>chromosome</b> or by how many the organism has. Genetic sex-determination, because it {{is determined}} by chromosome assortment, usually results in a 1:1 ratio of male and female offspring.|$|E
50|$|In a small {{percentage}} of cases, 48,XXYY syndrome results from nondisjunction of the <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in a 46,XY embryo very soon after fertilization has occurred. This means that an normal sperm cell with one Y chromosome fertilized a normal egg cell with one X chromosome, but right after fertilization nondisjunction of the <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> caused the embryo to gain two extra <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> resulting in a 48,XXYY embryo.|$|R
30|$|In the ASR for {{the origin}} of {{heteromorphic}} <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (Figure  6), the ancestral node for all Norops was coded without heteromorphic <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (PL[*]=[*] 0.99). Six independent occurrences of heteromorphic <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> were observed. It {{is worth noting that}} the same types of <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> the heteromorphism of macrochromosome 7 and multiple <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> resulted from independent origins in groups of three (A. conspersus, A. opalinus, and A. onca) and two species (A. sagrei and A. biporcatus), respectively. Heteromorphic <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> of different sizes resulted at {{the origin of}} the monophyletic group composed of A. nebuloides, A. nebulosus, and A. quercorum. It is not clear when these heteromorphic chromosomes arose. Their formation could have occurred at node 4 (PL[*]=[*] 0.27) but was more likely to have occurred in the ancestor of the three species (PL[*]=[*] 0.84). Node 5, basal to 2 n[*]=[*] 40 species, was uncertain under ML. Under MP, this node was coded equally as state 0 (absence of heteromorphic XY) or 1 (heteromorphic XY) (not shown).|$|R
30|$|Finally, we {{analyzed}} {{the emergence of}} heteromorphic <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> We identified three different patterns of <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in Norops (Table  1) and coded them in four states: state 0, the absence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes; state 1, heteromorphism at macrochromosome pair 7 (same size); state 2, multiple <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> X 1 X 1 X 2 X 2 /X 1 X 2 Y; and state 3, heteromorphism at one macrochromosome pair (different sizes). Character states 2 and 3 included species with slightly different heteromorphic <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> Additional separation using more states was not feasible. We also coded 11 species as uncertain {{in view of the}} fact that the macrochromosomes in those species have not been studied in sufficient detail. The outgroup was coded as state 2 because of the presence of multiple <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in the outgroup species.|$|R
25|$|In birds, {{which have}} a ZW sex-determination system, the {{opposite}} is true: the W chromosome carries factors responsible for female development, and default development is male. In this case ZZ individuals are male and ZW are female. The majority of butterflies and moths also have a ZW sex-determination system. In both XY and ZW sex determination systems, the <b>sex</b> <b>chromosome</b> carrying the critical factors is often significantly smaller, carrying {{little more than the}} genes necessary for triggering the development of a given sex.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{explanation of}} how the inheritance of gens works is as follows. The egg colour is inherited by <b>sex</b> <b>chromosome.</b> In birds sex determination is ZZ/ZW, and unlike mammals, the heterogametic sex is the female. The determining gene (or super-gene) for the inheritance of egg colour {{is believed to be}} carried on the W chromosome, which is directly transmitted in the female line. The female behaviour in choosing the host species is set by imprinting after birth, a common mechanism in bird behaviour.|$|E
25|$|People {{with the}} 47,XYY {{karyotype}} {{have an increased}} growth velocity from early childhood, with an average final height approximately 7cm (3") above expected final height. In Edinburgh, Scotland, eight 47,XYY boys born 1967–1972 and identified in a newborn screening programme had an average height of 188.1cm (6'2") at age 18—their fathers' average height was 174.1cm (5'8½"), their mothers' average height was 162.8cm (5'4"). The increased gene dosage of three X/Y chromosome pseudoautosomal region (PAR1) SHOX genes has been postulated {{as a cause of}} the increased stature seen in all three <b>sex</b> <b>chromosome</b> trisomies: 47,XXX, 47,XXY, and 47,XYY.|$|E
30|$|The {{second type}} of <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> with X 1 X 2 Y males and X 1 X 1 X 2 X 2 females was {{described}} in A. biporcatus (Gorman and Atkins 1966) and A. sagrei (De Smet 1981). Yet, the <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in these two species obviously differ {{because one of the}} X chromosomes and the Y chromosome are medium-sized in A. biporcatus, while in A. sagrei, all <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are shaped as microchromosomes (Gorman and Atkins 1966; De Smet 1981). Moreover, A. sagrei and A. biporcatus are unrelated species (Figure  6), and their <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> might thus have occurred independently. The presence of multiple <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> is usually due to autosome-sex chromosome translocations (Ashley 2002). The occurrence of such rearrangements has not been studied in Anolis, but our review indicates that the genus may be prone to this kind of rearrangement.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In Mormidea paupercula (n = 6 + XY in males), the {{presence}} of a CMA 3 -bright band in the telomeric regions on both <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> allowed the analysis of the kinetic activity of the sex univalents and XY pseudobivalent at the first and second meiotic divisions, respectively. The separation of the sister chromatids of the <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> occurs from a pair of telomeric regions (with or without a band), with opposite telomeric regions remaining associated with each other at meiosis I; the behaviour of both <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> differs, on the X chromosome both telomeric regions are similarly active, while on the Y chromosome the telomeric region without a band is more frequently active. At the second division, the most frequent associations in the pseudobivalent occur between the telomeric regions of both <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> with bands or without bands. Therefore, in both meiotic divisions, the same telomeric region on the <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> could lead the migration, in contrast to that observed usually in autosomal bivalents. These results provide evidence that the <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> of Heteroptera show more than one pattern of attachment to the spindle...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> {{are a very}} {{peculiar}} part of {{the genome}} that have evolved independently in many groups of animals and plants (Bull). Major research efforts have so far been focused on large heteromorphic <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in a few animal and plant species (Chibalina and Filatov; Zhou and Bachtrog; Bellott et al.; Hough et al.; Zhou et al.), while homomorphic (cytologically indistinguishable) <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> have largely been neglected. However, this situation is starting to change. In this issue, Geraldes et al. () describe a small (~ 100  kb long) sex-determining region on the homomorphic <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> of poplars (Populus trichocarpa and related species, Fig.  ). All species in Populus and its sister genus Salix are dioecious, suggesting that dioecy and the <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> if any, should be relatively old. Contrary to this expectation, Geraldes et al. () demonstrate that the sex-determining region in poplars is of very recent origin and probably evolved within the genus Populus only a few million years ago...|$|R
25|$|Many insects use a sex {{determination}} {{system based on}} the number of sex chromosomes. This is called X0 sex-determination—the 0 indicates the absence of the <b>sex</b> <b>chromosome.</b> All other chromosomes in these organisms are diploid, but organisms may inherit one or two X chromosomes. In field crickets, for example, insects with a single X chromosome develop as male, while those with two develop as female. In the nematode C. elegans most worms are self-fertilizing XX hermaphrodites, but occasionally abnormalities in chromosome inheritance regularly give rise to individuals with only one X chromosome—these X0 individuals are fertile males (and half their offspring are male).|$|E
25|$|However, {{even among}} primates, full color vision differs between New World and Old World monkeys. Old World primates, {{including}} monkeys and all apes, have vision similar to humans. New World monkeys {{may or may}} not have color sensitivity at this level: in most species, males are dichromats, and about 60% of females are trichromats, but the owl monkeys are cone monochromats, and both sexes of howler monkeys are trichromats. Visual sensitivity differences between males and females in a single species is due to the gene for yellow-green sensitive opsin protein (which confers ability to differentiate red from green) residing on the X <b>sex</b> <b>chromosome.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other animals, {{including}} most insects and many fish, have larger females. This {{may be associated}} with the cost of producing egg cells, which requires more nutrition than producing sperm—larger females are able to produce more eggs. For example, female southern black widow spiders are typically twice as long as the males. Occasionally this dimorphism is extreme, with males reduced to living as parasites dependent on the female, such as in the anglerfish. Some plant species also exhibit dimorphism in which the females are significantly larger than the males, such as in the moss Dicranum and the liverwort Sphaerocarpos. There is some evidence that, in these genera, the dimorphism may be tied to a <b>sex</b> <b>chromosome,</b> or to chemical signalling from females.|$|E

25|$|In autumn, aphids undergo sexual, oviparous reproduction. A {{change in}} {{photoperiod}} and temperature, {{or perhaps a}} lower food quantity or quality, causes females to parthenogenetically produce sexual females and males. The males are genetically identical to their mothers except they have one fewer <b>sex</b> <b>chromosome.</b> These sexual aphids may lack wings or even mouthparts. Sexual females and males mate, and females lay eggs that develop outside the mother. The eggs endure the winter and emerge as winged or wingless females the following spring. This is, for example, {{the life cycle of}} the rose aphid (Macrosiphum rosae, or less commonly Aphis rosae), which may be considered typical of the family. However, in warm environments, such as in the tropics or in a greenhouse, aphids may go on reproducing asexually for many years.|$|E
25|$|In birds, whose cells contain microchromosomes, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that there was a correlation between the presence of mega-telomeres and the number of microchromosomes present in a species, such that bird genomes with large numbers of microchromosomes also possessed larger amounts of telomeric DNA sequence. It was thought that these telomeric sequences might protect genes on these tiny chromosomes from erosion during cell division. However, subsequent studies showed that mega-telomeres are not necessarily present in all species with microchromosomes, nor are they found on all microchromosomes within a cell. Mega-telomeres are also thought contribute to the high recombination rate of chicken microchromosomes. The longest mega-telomere in chickens is associated with the W (female) chromosome, suggesting that mega-telomeres may also affect <b>sex</b> <b>chromosome</b> organization and the generation of genetic variation.|$|E
25|$|Morgan and his {{students}} became more successful at finding mutant flies; they counted the mutant characteristics of thousands of fruit flies and studied their inheritance. As they accumulated multiple mutants, they combined them to study more complex inheritance patterns. The observation of a miniature-wing mutant, which was also on the <b>sex</b> <b>chromosome</b> but sometimes sorted independently to the white-eye mutation, led Morgan {{to the idea of}} genetic linkage and to hypothesize the phenomenon of crossing over. He relied on the discovery of Frans Alfons Janssens, a Belgian professor at the University of Leuven, who described the phenomenon in 1909 and had called it chiasmatypie. Morgan proposed that the amount of crossing over between linked genes differs and that crossover frequency might indicate the distance separating genes on the chromosome. The later English geneticist J. B. S. Haldane suggested that the unit of measurement for linkage be called the morgan. Morgan's student Alfred Sturtevant developed the first genetic map in 1913.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Relatively few {{species of}} {{flowering}} plants are dioecious {{and even fewer}} {{are known to have}} <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> Current theory posits that homomorphic <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> such as found in Bryonia dioica (Cucurbitaceae), offer insight into the early stages in the evolution of <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> from autosomes. Little is known about these early steps, but an accumulation of transposable element sequences has been observed on the Y-chromosomes of some species with heteromorphic <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> Recombination, by which transposable elements are removed, is suppressed on {{at least part of the}} emerging Y-chromosome, and this may explain the correlation between the emergence of <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> and transposable element enrichment. Findings We sequenced 2321 bp of the Y-chromosome in Bryonia dioica that flank a male-linked marker, BdY 1, reported previously. Within this region, which should be suppressed for recombination, we observed a solo-LTR nested in a Copia -like transposable element. We also found other, presumably paralogous, solo-LTRs in a consensus sequence of the underlying Copia -like transposable element. Conclusions Given that solo-LTRs arise via recombination events, it is noteworthy that we find one in a genomic region where recombination should be suppressed. Although the solo-LTR could have arisen before recombination was suppressed, creating the male-linked marker BdY 1, our previous study on B. dioica suggested that BdY 1 may not lie in the recombination-suppressed region of the Y-chromosome in all populations. Presence of a solo-LTR near BdY 1 therefore fits with the observed correlation between retrotransposon accumulation and the suppression of recombination early in the evolution of <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> These findings further suggest that the homomorphic <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes</b> of B. dioica, the first organism for which genetic XY sex-determination was inferred, are evolutionarily young and offer reference information for comparative studies of other plant <b>sex</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> </p...|$|R
