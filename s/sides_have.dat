5|$|Teams {{representing}} England {{have played}} international matches at St Andrew's, though not at senior level. In 1957, England B defeated Scotland B under floodlights {{in front of}} nearly 40,000 spectators.

5|$|A Test {{match is}} won when one side has scored more runs {{than the total}} runs scored by the {{opposing}} side during their two innings. If both <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> completed both their allocated innings and the side that fielded last has the higher aggregate of runs, it {{is known as a}} win by runs. This indicates the number of runs that they had scored more than the opposing side. If one side scores more runs in a single innings than the total runs scored by the other side in both their innings, it is known as a win by innings and runs. If the side batting last wins the match, it is known as a win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets that were still to fall.|$|E

5|$|Insect {{attributes}} {{are sometimes}} mimicked in architecture, {{as at the}} Eastgate Centre, Harare, which uses passive cooling, storing heat {{in the morning and}} releasing it in the warm parts of the day. The target of this piece of biomimicry is the structure of the mounds of termites such as Macrotermes michaelseni which effectively cool the nests of these social insects. The properties of the Namib desert beetle's exoskeleton, in particular its wing-cases (elytra) which have bumps with hydrophilic (water-attracting) tips and hydrophobic (water-shedding) <b>sides,</b> <b>have</b> been mimicked in a film coating designed for the British Ministry of Defence, to capture water in arid regions.|$|E
5|$|Rugby {{union was}} not entirely driven from Northern England, and in the 1970s the region was home to several strong teams. The high-water mark of rugby union in Northern England was the 1979 New Zealand tour during which the English Northern Division was the only team to defeat the All Blacks. In the 21st century the region's club <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> become less popular, with {{association}} football, cricket and rugby league attracting more spectators and talent. In the 2017–18 season, Sale Sharks and Newcastle Falcons play in the English Premiership, whereas Yorkshire Carnegie, Doncaster R.F.C. and Rotherham R.U.F.C. play in the RFU Championship.|$|E
5|$|The double finial minaret {{was built}} in 1509 by Qansah al-Ghuri.

The second shaft, is a 12 - sided polygon separated from the first by a fretted balconies supported by muqarnas is decorated with blue faience. A balcony separates the third level from the second shaft. The third level {{is made up of}} two rectangular shafts with horseshoe arches on each side of both shafts.

5|$|The {{school has}} a strong {{sporting}} tradition. For boys' sports, some Malvernians would consider the College to be {{best known as a}} football school although its cricket <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> also produced players who have gone on to play at international level. Traditionally, sport for boys used to be split between the original 'major sports' of football, cricket, and rackets (rugby was added later), and 'minor sports'. Colours were awarded for each major sport, as appropriate. After 1995, the distinction between 'major sport' and 'minor sport' was removed. The girls' main sports are hockey and lacrosse in the winter, lacrosse and netball in the Lent Term and tennis and rounders in the summer.|$|E
5|$|There {{are seven}} types of {{units in the}} game. Each unit has a set of {{statistics}} which is displayed in the interface once selected. The statistics range from combat strength, fatigue, efficiency, supply and movement points. During the game, both <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> the option to request air support {{that can be used}} to attack enemy units. If the other side uses their air support, the player will be given a warning of an oncoming air strike and will have the option to retreat. The game has two endings depending on the side chosen. If playing as NATO, the main objective is to stall Soviet forces long enough until American reinforcements arrive. However, if playing as the Warsaw Pact, the objective is to destroy all NATO forces.|$|E
5|$|Warcraft: Orcs & Humans is a {{real-time}} strategy game (RTS). The player {{takes the}} role of either the Human inhabitants of Azeroth, or the invading Orcs. In the single player campaign mode the player works {{through a series of}} missions, the objective of which varies, but usually involves building a small town, harvesting resources, building an army and then leading it to victory. In multiplayer games, the objective is always to destroy the enemy players' forces. Some scenarios are complicated by the presence of wild monsters, but sometimes these monsters can be used as troops. The game plays in a medieval setting with fantasy elements. Both <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> melee units and ranged units, and also spellcasters.|$|E
25|$|Chariot + soldier vs 2 unadvanced {{soldiers}} + 4 defensive pieces: If {{the offensive}} <b>side</b> <b>has</b> no defensive piece, it is a draw since the 2 enemy soldiers {{can still be}} a formidable force. If the offensive <b>side</b> <b>has</b> one advisor, it is a win.|$|R

5|$|Tessellations {{have given}} rise to many types of tiling puzzle, from {{traditional}} jigsaw puzzles (with irregular pieces of wood or cardboard) and the tangram to more modern puzzles which often have a mathematical basis. For example, polyiamonds and polyominoes are figures of regular triangles and squares, often used in tiling puzzles. Authors such as Henry Dudeney and Martin Gardner have made many uses of tessellation in recreational mathematics. For example, Dudeney invented the hinged dissection, while Gardner wrote about the rep-tile, a shape that can be dissected into smaller copies of the same shape. Inspired by Gardner's articles in Scientific American, the amateur mathematician Marjorie Rice found four new tessellations with pentagons. Squaring the square is the problem of tiling an integral square (one whose <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> integer length) using only other integral squares. An extension is squaring the plane, tiling it by squares whose sizes are all natural numbers without repetitions; James and Frederick Henle proved that this was possible.|$|E
5|$|The county road {{designation}} continues {{north on}} Wright Street. This segment of CR492 {{is separated from}} the southern section by US41/M-28. Traffic crossing between the two <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> to use the main highway through median turn arounds in a maneuver similar to a Michigan left. The roadway leaves the commercial corridor and returns to woodland before the intersection with Forestville Road and Commerce Drive. Wright Street curves to the northeast and then the east crossing into the westernmost section of the City of Marquette. As Wright Street continues eastward, it runs through a residential section along {{part of the city}} line before completely crossing into Marquette. The roadway passes the Holy Cross Cemetery and {{the north side of the}} campus of Northern Michigan University (NMU). The northern main entrance to campus is located at the intersection with CR550 (Sugar Loaf Avenue) and Tracy Avenue. Wright Street passes through residential neighborhoods east of CR550 before meeting Presque Isle Avenue. East of that intersection, CR492 crosses onto the northern edge of NMU's campus immediately north of the Superior Dome. Wright Street ends as it curves around to the south into a junction with Lakeshore Boulevard at the shore of Lake Superior.|$|E
5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Millwall and West Ham United {{is one of}} the longest-standing and most bitter in English football. The two teams, then known as Millwall Athletic and Thames Ironworks, both {{originated}} in the East End of London, and were located under three miles apart. They first played each other in the 1899–1900 FA Cup. The match was historically known as the Dockers derby, as both sets of supporters were predominantly dockers at shipyards {{on either side of the}} River Thames. Consequently, each set of fans worked for rival firms who were competing for the same business; this intensified the tension between the teams. In 1910, Millwall moved south of the River Thames to New Cross and the teams were no longer East London neighbours. Both <b>sides</b> <b>have</b> relocated since, but remain just under four miles apart. Millwall moved to The Den in Bermondsey in 1993 and West Ham to the London Stadium in Stratford in 2016.|$|E
