5000|$|The ASF Policy Framework and the Roadmap for the Operationalization of the ASF {{called for}} the {{establishment}} of a [...] "Rapid Deployment Capability" [...] (RDC) capable of intervening, within fourteen days, in cases of Genocide and gross human rights abuses under Scenario 6. The RDC was decided to be an integral part of the regional <b>Standby</b> <b>Forces</b> to be deployed at the entry point, as a precursor to the deployment of a larger mission. At the end of 2013, the Expert Panel of the AU stated that the goal, recommended in Roadmap III, to test, evaluate and operationalize the RDC by 2012, was not met.|$|E
50|$|The Roadmap also {{outlined}} several {{fields of}} progress {{in the development of}} the ASF. These achievements include the production of a set of common policy documents, an annual continental training program, and improved training standards within nations and <b>standby</b> <b>forces</b> that could be used collectively, albeit at an initial operational capability at the moment, mainly for logistic and institutional reasons. Notable progress was also ascertained in the development of a harmonized Rapid Deployment Capability (RDC) concept. Lastly, the Roadmap saw progress in the evolution of the police component, notably in the area of policy development and the establishment of management capabilities at the strategic level of the AU and the operational level of the RECs/RMs.|$|E

40|$|With UN {{peacekeeping}} {{activities in}} recent years having become more numerous, complex and costly, alternative means of responding to emerging crises and conflicts are being proposed and considered, along with their financial costs and funding. This paper analyzes the economic {{costs and benefits of}} recent options from a global resource point of view. It is concluded that <b>standby</b> <b>forces</b> provided by Member States to the UN, such as the multinational Stand-by Forces High Readiness Brigade for UN Operations (SHIRBRIG) and the more recent European Union (EU) Rapid Reaction Force (RRF), appear presently to be economically the most efficient means of providing UN peacekeeping. <b>Standby</b> <b>forces,</b> acknowledged by the UN as a feasible alternative to a UN standing army or police force, are economically the most efficient basically because they utilize more fully the existing military resources of Member States, rather than require major additional new resources for peacekeeping.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitednited Nations reform debates {{have tended to}} focus on how to change the organizational structure of the United Nations {{in order to make it}} more efficient. The central question addressed by this thesis is one that has received little attention in these reform debates: "what can the UN, and only the UN, add to our efforts to control conflict?" This thesis examines the hypothesis that the United Nations is unique in its potential ability to build international consensus and to bring international legitimacy to collective response efforts. The goal of this thesis is to show that while the U. N. is ineffective, organizational reforms such as providing the UN <b>standby</b> <b>forces,</b> improving its ability to command forces, or creating an Inspector General will not solve the most critical threat to the organization - its declining legitimacy in the world. This thesis reveals that new problems in a changing world require collective response, hence, the need for a legitimate UN. U. S. Navy (USN) autho...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} South Africa’s {{engagement with the}} rest of the African continent in the realm of peace and security since 1994. It notes that despite expectations from the international community as well as its own policy documents that South Africa would promote human rights on the continent, this has not occurred in a substantial manner. Pretoria has been naı¨ve in its mediation attempts, or worse. Pretoria’s ambiguous position in relation to human rights is not only a product of domestic variables but also its own lack of capacity, especially on the military front. These domestic constraints are reinforced at a regional level where structures like the African <b>Standby</b> <b>Forces</b> are little more than ‘paper tigers’. This serves to reinforce the status quo, ultimately undermining human security and escalating prospects for future conflict. At the same time the article does point to some positive developments arising from the Zuma administration in its engagement on the African continent in its efforts to secure human security for Africa’s citizens.

40|$|Since the {{reorganization}} of the African Union (AU), African regional integration organizations (RIO) obtained a more important role, not only within the African Economic Community, but also for regional security reasons. 1 Hence parallel to the RIOs becoming columns for an African economic integration process, their meaning as regional security clusters has to be mentioned too. 2 Through the establishment of regional <b>standby</b> <b>forces</b> (SADCBRIG) 3 and the reformed regional security architecture namely the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security (OPDS), Southern African Development Community (SADC) tries {{to build up the}} regional security column for a new African security and defence architecture. 4 Since 2001 OPDS is the SADC answer to the claims of AU, but does the Organ really play an important role on regional security matters 5 ? Is OPDS more or less a ‘paper tiger’ 6 without any influence on regional crisis prevention and security policies, or is it able to have a real impact on the national and regional decision-making processes 7 ?

40|$|Ethiopia, {{being one}} of the force-contributing {{countries}} to the East African Standby Brigade (EASBRIG) and given its, resources, strategic location, and its military's long history, will have a significant role to play in creating a stable environment in the sub-region. This thesis analyzes the Organization of African Union/African Union (OAU/AU) efforts after the Cold War to restore security and ensure stability in the region and outlines the process of creating African <b>Standby</b> <b>Forces</b> (ASF) as sub-regional arrangements to bring stability and peace by preventing crises or responding to crises whenever they arise in the region. To fulfill such missions East African states have agreed to form the EASBRIG with each state contributing forces. This thesis also analyzes Ethiopia's past and current participation in peace operations (from 1951 in Korea to ongoing missions in Liberia and Burundi) and argues that though Ethiopia's participation in peace operations is commendable, many things could yet be improved and corrective measures need to be taken to better prepare for mission execution in regional and sub-regional crisis response efforts. There is work yet to be done on peacekeeping and peace enforcement in particular. How to better organize Ethiopia's Peace Force and increase their efficiency and effectiveness for future peace operations is a main goal of this thesis...|$|E
