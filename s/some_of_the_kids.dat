5|$|The {{story is}} {{virtually}} {{the same in the}} DS version, but with some major differences in the introductory sequence: Luneth goes to the Altar Cave alone, but while exploring he trips and falls into a hole created by the earthquake. He is then beset by goblins, and while he is frantically searching for a way out, he comes upon the wind crystal. It tells him that he has been chosen as a Warrior of Light, destined to restore balance to the world, and there are three others like him, but before Luneth can ask it to elaborate, he is teleported to the surface. He returns to Ur, but Elder Topapa does not elucidate much on the matter. Going to a corner of town, Luneth finds his friend Arc being bullied by <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids.</b> When Luneth intervenes, Arc runs away, heading for the village of Kazus.|$|E
500|$|According to some versions, {{including}} {{comments from}} <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> {{standing outside the}} store, Till may have wolf-whistled at Bryant. Following his disappearance, a newspaper account stated that Till sometimes whistled to alleviate his stuttering. His speech was sometimes unclear; his mother said he had particular difficulty with pronouncing [...] "b" [...] sounds, {{and he may have}} whistled to overcome problems asking for bubble gum. She said that, to help with his articulation, she taught Till how to whistle softly to himself before pronouncing his words.|$|E
500|$|The Seventh Victim did not {{fare well}} with audiences. A cinema {{proprietor}} in South Carolina reported that theatergoers were disappointed: [...] "We {{must have been}} the eighth victim; patrons walked out. Business poor. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> would not sit through it." [...] A.C. Edwards, a theater employee in Scotia, California, said it was [...] "without doubt the most unsatisfactory picture we have any recollection of." [...] The failure to generate considerable income at the box office (on top of the financial failure of Lewton and Robson's follow-up picture, The Ghost Ship) would result in Lewton scrapping two planned projects, The Screaming Skull and The Amorous Ghost.|$|E
5000|$|Hartlepool - one Unlucky Alf scene had {{him sitting}} in the empty Rink End Stand of Hartlepool United's ground, Victoria Park. Also, one Ed Winchester scene was in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mill House Stand. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brilliant <b>Kid</b> scenes were also filmed at nearby Seal Sands.|$|R
50|$|She {{was born}} Ada Caldwell in Melbourne, Victoria {{and raised in}} <b>the</b> suburb <b>of</b> Balwyn. Her father, Edgar, was a plumber. Caldwell's mother often took <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{neighbourhood}} <b>kids</b> to <b>the</b> Elizabethan Theatre in Richmond where they could go backstage and watch rehearsals and performances.|$|R
50|$|From October 1996 to March 1997, <b>some</b> episodes <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Oz <b>Kids</b> were {{released}} in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> nine VHS volumes by Paramount Home Video.|$|R
2500|$|Aiken {{makes it}} clear that he is aware not {{everyone}} shares his religious beliefs and it is not his intention to press these beliefs on others. When he worked as a camp counselor at the YMCA, he challenged other camp faculty by insisting that singing [...] "overtly Christian songs" [...] was inappropriate, as <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> were Jewish. [...] "I stood firm... no child {{is going to have a}} spiritual crisis on my watch." [...] His public philosophy, geared towards inclusion and service to others, reflects his stance that decisions about religion should be made at home.|$|E
2500|$|... "Many {{kids got}} killed because the Vietnamese are very good. Most of the Vietnamese {{soldiers}} had experience with Americans, and we didn't know that...And I became {{good friends with}} <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids,</b> and in the battlefields sometimes they got shot in {{the left and the}} right from me, in the stomach and the head. Many times I held them, blood all over me. The worst feeling I had was that you can’t help them at all...I saw kids and adults got hit in the head, by the bullets, crawling. So I don't believe in crawling anymore. I just stood up and shoot like hell...I fought about two or three months. The thing that I couldn't take is to watch my friends dying every day. That's the worst feeling." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, whom do {{you suggest}} instead of them? <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> are jolly keen and all that, but they wouldn't be much good against Baynes and Lorimer, for instance.' ...|$|E
5000|$|From issue #93 (July 1970) on, Two-Gun Kid {{was mostly}} a reprint title. At one point later in <b>the</b> second series, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} <b>Kid's</b> adventures were retouched {{to make him}} look like <b>the</b> newer <b>Kid</b> for reprints. Reprints, including many Jack Kirby-drawn stories, also appeared in the 1968-1976 title The Mighty Marvel Western.|$|R
5000|$|No More Bullies (February 28, 2010) - Apollo is {{depressed}} when <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bigger <b>kids</b> {{had made}} fun of his big ears and that they won't let him play with them. When Apollo is still bothered by this, the Pajanimals ride Sweetpea Sue's bed to the Friendly Forest, where they turn to Jerry Bear and Otis Owl for help.|$|R
5000|$|Chelsea's other friend, Perky Palmer, <b>the</b> {{daughter}} <b>of</b> {{one of her}} father's law partners, was {{a vicious}} schemer whose constant lies had almost sent <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mill <b>kids</b> to jail. She was often derisively called the [...] "Palmer Witch". However, eventually, Perky and Ryan began to unbend to Dawn and somewhat welcomed her into their circle of friends. Another friend was Ian McFarland, a young cultured man, who was friends with both Chelsea and Dawn.|$|R
6000|$|... "Seems to me I heard <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> talking last summer," [...] she mused, ponderingly. [...] "Vane Thesel {{was stuck}} on Mel Iden and Dot Dalrymple both before the war. Dot {{handed him a}} lemon. He's still trying to rush Dot, and the gossip is he'd go after Mel even now on the sly, if she'd stand for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was an invigorating time," [...] said Psmith. [...] "A sort of pageant. I was {{particularly}} struck {{with the way}} some of the bright lads caught hold of the idea. There was no skimping. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids,</b> to my certain knowledge, went down the chute a dozen times. There's nothing like doing a thing thoroughly. I saw them come down, rush upstairs, and be saved again, time after time. The thing became chronic with them. I should say Comrade Downing ought {{to be satisfied with}} the high state of efficiency to which he has brought us. At any rate I hope--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If I were you,' said Marriott, 'I shouldn't {{think about}} their batting at all. I should go simply for fielding. With a good fielding side {{we ought to have}} quite a decent chance. There's no earthly reason why you and Reece shouldn't put on enough for the first wicket to win all the matches. It's been done before. Don't you {{remember}} the School House getting the cup four years ago when Twiss was captain? They had nobody who was any earthly good except Twiss and Birch, and those two used to make about a hundred and fifty between them in every match. Besides, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> can bat rather well. Wilson for one. He can bowl, too.' ...|$|E
50|$|In issue #2, the X-Mansion {{is shown}} to be an orphanage for troubled kids that is run by Prof. X and the {{teachers}} include Storm and Beast. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orphans include <b>kid</b> versions of Deadpool, Scott Summers, Wolverine, Angel and Colossus.|$|R
50|$|Results {{from the}} {{experiment}} showed drastic differences. It {{was found that}} children raised in the orphanage, whom had received minimal care, had less developmental progress than children raised in the prison. Only 26 kids could walk, {{and only a few}} could talk. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orphanage <b>kids</b> had signs of mental retardation and were psychologically and socially underdeveloped for their age. Whereas in the prison group, most all the children had reached <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> full development for their age division.|$|R
5000|$|Dewayne Pomeroy: As {{shown in}} the movie, he hanged himself in July 1984, the day before his 17th birthday. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> street <b>kids</b> held a balloon release and planted a tree in Freeway Park in his memory. Plaque 21394 {{on the ground at}} the Pike Place Market says [...] "Dewayne Pomeroy 1984". His story and {{relationship}} with his felon father was the inspiration for the 1992 film American Heart with starring Jeff Bridges, with Edward Furlong playing Dewayne's part.|$|R
6000|$|The man resists, but he {{is already}} {{practically}} helpless. The road-kids are upon him from every side, clinging to {{arms and legs and}} body, and like a wolf at the throat of a moose Barber Kid hangs on and drags backward. Over the man goes, and down under the heap. Barber Kid changes the position of his own body, but never lets go. While <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> are [...] "going through" [...] the victim, others are holding his legs so that he cannot kick and thresh about. They improve the opportunity by taking off the man's shoes. As for him, he has given in. He is beaten. Also, what of the strong arm at his throat, he is short of wind. He is making ugly choking noises, and the kids hurry. They really don't want to kill him. All is done. At a word all holds are released at once, and the kids scatter, one of them lugging the shoes--he knows where he can get half a dollar for them. The man sits up and looks about him, dazed and helpless. Even if he wanted to, barefooted pursuit in the darkness would be hopeless. I linger a moment and watch him. He is feeling at his throat, making dry, hawking noises, and jerking his head in a quaint way as though to assure himself that the neck is not dislocated. Then I slip away to join the push, and see that man no more--though I shall always see him, sitting there in the starlight, somewhat dazed, a bit frightened, greatly dishevelled, and making quaint jerking movements of head and neck.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, an {{earthquake}} struck Padang leaving many people homeless. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> {{were out of}} school or had to attend school outdoors. This was a tragic time {{for the people of}} Indonesia.|$|E
50|$|Camp Crocodile: A lakeside {{summer camp}} is {{anything}} but restful when <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> begin disappearing and, {{when one of the}} campers swears a giant crocodile is responsible, no one believes him until it is too late.|$|E
50|$|Linus was {{the first}} {{character}} in the series that Frieda met. She sat behind him in school, and after they became friends he took her around and introduced her to <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other <b>kids</b> in <b>the</b> neighborhood. Not much is shown of their friendship beyond those strips that introduce her, but even that early in their relationship they seemed {{to look out for}} each other. Linus tried to protect her the first time she unintentionally upset Lucy (see below), and she in turn was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few <b>kids</b> who didn't see his need for a security blanket as a bad thing, for which he was so grateful that he kissed her hand.|$|R
50|$|Raymond finally {{decides to}} take both Courgette and Camille in as foster children. Simon is {{initially}} angry, but he ultimately coaxes a reluctant Courgette {{to go with}} Raymond. Raymond takes <b>some</b> group photos <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> before he leaves with Courgette and Camille. While living with Raymond, Courgette still writes letters to <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> at <b>the</b> orphanage, maintaining that he, Camille and Raymond are people that still love them all. Courgette now keeps a group photo <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> on his kite.|$|R
5000|$|Tommy Cadle - Tommy Cadle {{was a happy}} boy who had no cares in {{the world}} and did well in school, but at least until the aliens came along. Tommy is <b>the</b> {{scapegoat}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show and is bullied by <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other <b>kids</b> because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aliens' actions. He gets really annoyed by the aliens' actions and sometimes hates them. However he does generally accept the aliens as part of his life and sees Dinko as his close friend. The aliens always refer to him as [...] "Tommy of Earth" [...] and seem incapable of grasping that his name is just Tommy much to his annoyance. Voice of Charlie Schlatter.|$|R
5000|$|Orion - A ginger cat {{belonging}} to Nick and Rachel. Rhiannon and Small Sam {{think he is}} ugly. When <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> try to escape, they run into Orion, and he hisses in surprise, alerting Nick and Rachel to the escape.|$|E
50|$|Screenwriters Charles S. Haas and Tim Hunter {{began work}} {{shortly after the}} article's publication, {{including}} field research in the town itself where they interviewed <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids.</b> Hunter said that the script accurately reflected the article {{with the exception of}} a more violent ending.|$|E
5000|$|Adults {{demanding}} {{the kids to}} leave: several times, as the adults feel offended by <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> actions (mostly Dón Ramón and rarely Doña Florinda and Professor Jirafales), they commonly say the kids to leave {{the place where they}} all are (or do something different) by a very comic way.|$|E
5000|$|For many years, Big Bird was {{the only}} {{character}} on the show who saw Snuffy, but later in the 17th season (1985) he showed his friends on Sesame Street his [...] "imaginary" [...] friend, so they believed him. Before that happened, the main adult characters teased Big Bird {{when he said he}} had seen him, because they did not believe there was such an animal, often despite evidence to the contrary (such as an oversized teddy bear that Snuffy had left behind, or segments in which Snuffy interacted with other characters, such as a street scene where Snuffy was seen playing London Bridge with <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neighborhood <b>kids).</b> This concept was meant to echo <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> imaginary friends <b>some</b> young children have.|$|R
2500|$|In 1989, {{members of}} Devo were {{involved}} in <b>the</b> project Visiting <b>Kids,</b> releasing a self-titled EP on the New Rose label in 1990.

50|$|In 1950, Columbia Pictures {{released}} the comedy/mystery The Good Humor Man with Jack Carson, Lola Albright, and George Reeves.

50|$|The writers for the {{narration}} sometimes gave rather odd names to <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> in the shorts. Others however {{were identified by}} their familiar names. Our Gang members Mickey, Mary, Ernie, Farina, Jackie, and Johnny all had their familiar names retained. Meanwhile, Joe Cobb was called 'Joey', Jack Davis {{was referred to as}} 'Rocky', and Jay R. Smith was called 'Freckles'.|$|E

500|$|Other {{perpetrators}} {{suggest that}} their lying may actually assist group members, as {{one member of}} a Harry Potter fan forum posted following the discovery that she had not, in fact, died of tuberculosis: [...] "After realising the effect my bravery in my illness had on people, I then {{used it as a}} vehicle to try and get <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> idiot emo <b>kids</b> on [...] to buck up and realise they don't really have it all that bad ... the lie was worth something, wasn't it?

50|$|Kyle is {{generally}} kind and considerate and is decent {{to his fellow}} cherubs. He {{is seen as a}} role model for <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> younger <b>kids,</b> which is evident in Mad Dogs, in which a number of agents go to him for advice. Despite this, he has a reputation of being disruptive in class and plays a number of practical jokes on his fellow agents. He is also not above mercilessly conning them for money, but as seen in Maximum Security has no problems with sharing his cash. Kyle always seems to have <b>some</b> sort <b>of</b> untrustable money-making scheme which is quietly run in the background and runs a successful unlicensed DVD business until it falls apart, thanks mainly to Jake Parker. He is also extremely popular around campus, proveable by the fact his farewell party at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> Mad Dogs reduced a number <b>of</b> agents, including <b>the</b> likes <b>of</b> best friend, James Adams to tears.|$|R
