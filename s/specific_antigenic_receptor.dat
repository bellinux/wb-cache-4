40|$|The {{localization}} of individually <b>specific</b> <b>antigenic</b> determinants on the monoclonal γM Mö was {{studied in}} gel diffusion experiments with 19 S γM Mö and its 7 S subunit. Various types of such determinants were delineated. Some were demonstrable {{both on the}} intact macroglobulin molecule and on the subunit. The latter was often unable to precipitate with the corresponding antibody, but combined with it and inhibited precipitation. Immunization of rabbits with purified γMs Mö was the most useful way to obtain antisera demonstrating individually <b>specific</b> <b>antigenic</b> determinants on the subunit by direct precipitation. Still other determinants were apparently destroyed by mild reduction of the γM molecule. Reduction and reassociation of mixtures of two monoclonal γM-globulins resulted in formation of hybrid molecules containing subunits of different origin.

Serological activity, i. e., cold agglutinin activity, was present in the hybrid molecules...|$|R

Similar antigenic determinants are present in antibodies induced by deliberate immunization, e. g. in human 3,G-type anti-A, anti-dextran, and anti-levan (3) and in rabbit anti-Salmonella typki (4), anti-Proteus (5) and antistreptococcal antibodies (6).

PBMC from seven HLA-DR 3 +, DQ 2 +, B 8 + healthy subjects and nine HLA-DR 3 −, DQ 2 −, B 8 − subjects were also studied as controls. PBMC from AE patients with HLA DR 3 +, DQ 2 + haplotype secreted higher levels of IL- 10 without any stimulation and after <b>specific</b> <b>antigenic</b> stimulation than did patients without this haplotype. Higher levels of IL- 5 and IFN-γ were also produced by these patients' PBMC after stimulation with non-purified parasitic antigenic preparations; however, the specific alkaline phosphatase antigen extracted from E. multilocularis induced only Th 2 -type cytokine secretion.

40|$|Abstract Background Mutations in LRRK 2 {{encoding}} leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 {{are thus}} {{far the most}} frequent genetic cause associated with autosomal dominant and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). To examine whether LRRK 2 is directly associated with neuropathology of PD and other related disorders, we analyzed LRRK 2 in brains of patients affected by PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) using highly specific antibodies to LRRK 2. Results We demonstrated that anti-LRRK 2 antibodies strongly labelled brainstem and cortical Lewy bodies, the pathological hallmarks of PD and DLB, respectively. In addition, anti-LRRK 2 also labelled brain vasculature, axons, and neuronal cell bodies. Interestingly, the immunocytochemical profile of LRRK 2 varied with different antibodies depending upon <b>specific</b> <b>antigenic</b> sites along the LRRK 2 protein. All anti-LRRK 2 antibodies tested that were raised against various regions of LRRK 2, {{were found to be}} immunoreactive to recombinant LRRK 2 on Western blots. However, only the antibodies raised against the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of LRRK 2, but not the regions containing folded protein domains, were positive in immunolabeling of Lewy bodies, suggesting a differential exposure of <b>specific</b> <b>antigenic</b> sites of LRRK 2 on tissue sections. Conclusion We conclude that LRRK 2 is a component of Lewy bodies in both PD and DLB, and therefore {{plays an important role in}} the Lewy body formation and disease pathogenesis. Information on the cellular localization of LRRK 2 under normal and pathological conditions will deepen our understanding of its functions and molecular pathways relevant to the progression of PD and related disorders. </p...|$|R

We investigated whether proinflammatory mouse T helper type 1 (Th 1) lymphocytes are more active in MMP secretion than naïve Th 0 or anti-inflammatory Th 2 phenotypes, {{in the absence of}} <b>specific</b> <b>antigenic</b> stimulation, under baseline conditions and after contact with irradiated macrophages. We also compared the effect of Th 0, Th 1 or Th 2 lymphocyte-conditioned medium and irradiated lymphocytes on MMP production from macrophages. Finally, we investigated whether CD 40 –CD 40 ligand (CD 40 L) interactions were involved in T-cell-stimulated MMP secretion from macrophages. Under baseline conditions, MMP- 2 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels were greater in Th 1 than Th 0 or Th 2 lymphocytes; MMP- 9 mRNA, but not protein, was also upregulated. In the presence of irradiated macrophages MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 production from Th 1 and Th 2 was greater than from Th 0 lymphocytes. Conditioned media from Th 1 but not Th 0 or Th 2 cells increased MMP- 9 secretion from macrophages. Irradiated Th 1 lymphocytes stimulated both MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 secretion from macrophages more than irradiated Th 2 or Th 0 cells; this activation was independent of CD 40 –CD 40 L interaction. These findings demonstrate for the first time greater MMP secretion by Th 1 than Th 2 or Th 0 lymphocytes and their greater ability to upregulate macrophage MMP secretion in the absence of <b>specific</b> <b>antigenic</b> stimulation. These mechanisms could promote matrix turnover in inflammatory states and, for example, promote atherosclerotic plaque rupture...|$|R
