Cathy Winks and Anne Semans, coauthors of The Good Vibrations Guide to Sex, recommended the Magic Wand for use both during foreplay and intercourse and noted couples could feel pleasure through the device together at the same time. Wendy Caster wrote in the 2003 edition of The Lesbian Sex Book that lesbians have enjoyed using the Magic Wand due to its ability to concentrate powerful vibration on the clitoris.|$|E

5|$|Catholic {{teaching}} regarding sexuality {{calls for}} a practice of chastity, {{with a focus on}} maintaining the spiritual and bodily integrity of the human person. Marriage is considered the only appropriate context for sexual activity. Church teachings about sexuality have become an issue of increasing controversy, especially after the close of the Second Vatican Council, due to changing cultural attitudes in the Western world described as the <b>sexual</b> <b>revolution.</b>|$|E
5|$|At home, the U.S. {{experienced}} sustained {{economic expansion}} and a {{rapid growth of}} its population and middle class. Construction of an Interstate Highway System transformed the nation's infrastructure over the following decades. Millions moved from farms and inner cities to large suburban housing developments. In 1959 Hawaii became the 50th and last U.S. state added to the country. The growing Civil Rights Movement used nonviolence to confront segregation and discrimination, with Martin Luther King Jr. becoming a prominent leader and figurehead. A combination of court decisions and legislation, culminating in the Civil Rights Act of 1968, sought to end racial discrimination. Meanwhile, a counterculture movement grew which was fueled by opposition to the Vietnam war, black nationalism, and the <b>sexual</b> <b>revolution.</b>|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{views on}} {{sexuality}} vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality {{have taken a}} few different directions. Matters such as the sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in {{what came to be}} known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the <b>sexual</b> <b>revolution</b> from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism.|$|E

50|$|Even after <b>sexual</b> <b>revolutions,</b> on {{the other}} hand, {{to the extent that}} it does not lead to {{procreation}} (or child-rearing, as it also might exist in same-sex marriage), romance remains peripheral though it may have virtues in the relief of stress, as a source of inspiration or adventure, or in development and the strengthening of certain social relations. It is difficult to imagine the tragic heroines, however, as having such practical considerations in mind.|$|R
50|$|Though the {{centrality}} of rivalry is not itself a cynical view, it does emphasize the mechanical in love relations. In that sense, it does resonate with capitalism and cynicism native to post-modernity. Romance in this context leans more on fashion and irony, though these were important for it in less emancipated times. <b>Sexual</b> <b>revolutions</b> have brought change to these areas. Wit or irony therefore encompass an instability of romance that is not entirely new but has a more central social role, fine-tuned to certain modern peculiarities and subversion originating in various social revolutions, culminating mostly in the 1960s.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the {{majority}} of women were still wearing highly structured undergarments. Girdles were considered the ladylike norm and represented close to 40% of industry sales by volume. The 1960s also brought to Canadian Lady the challenges of feminism, fashions and the <b>sexual</b> <b>revolution.</b> The feminist movement—cultured by thought leaders like Betty Friedan and Germaine Greer—questioned the mores that defined women's roles and appearance. Changes in fashion trends, such as pantyhose {{and the rise of the}} miniskirt, rendered the girdle unattractive and obsolete to a generation of women. While the intimate apparel industry fretted about bra-burning as a precursor to the decline of all foundation garment sales, women reserved their animosity for their girdles. The Canadian sales data for foundation undergarments, from 1960 to 1971, vividly demonstrates the shift in tastes.|$|E
5|$|Sexual Politics {{originated}} as Millett's PhD dissertation and {{was published}} in 1970, {{the same year that}} she was awarded her doctorate from Columbia University. The bestselling book, a critique of patriarchy in Western society and literature, addressed the sexism and heterosexism of the modern novelists D. H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, and Norman Mailer and contrasted their perspectives with the dissenting viewpoint of the homosexual author Jean Genet. Millett questioned the origins of patriarchy, argued that sex-based oppression was both political and cultural, and posited that undoing the traditional family was the key to true <b>sexual</b> <b>revolution.</b> In its first year on the market, the book sold 80,000 copies and went through seven printings and is considered to be the movement's manifesto.|$|E

The book follows the family through the 1960s and 1970s, as the children enter adolescence and discover themselves during the changing times of the 1960s and the <b>Sexual</b> <b>Revolution.</b> The Keane children, on entering early adulthood, begin to break away from their family and religious backgrounds. Jacob, the eldest child, serves in Vietnam and is killed in the French trenches. Michael moves away from Long Island and goes to study in a college in northern New York, but later turns to sex and drugs. Meanwhile, Annie, the bookworm of the family, leaves to study in England, but quickly changes her plans after meeting a man on a bus whom she likes.

5000|$|Pardis Mahdavi, {{a scholar}} whose {{academic}} focus is <b>sexual</b> <b>revolutions</b> in the Middle East, argues {{that not only}} are youth subverting these codes of dress in order to assert their agency {{in the face of}} the regime's attempts at repression, but also that [...] "this youth movement is changing the sociopolitical atmosphere Iran, and presenting the clerical members of the regime with their biggest challenge yet." [...] Fazaeli supports this idea of women as changing the sociopolitcal atmosphere in Iran, but also emphasizes that there is no monolithic Iranian woman and thus no monolithic approach to dress in Iran: [...] "Are all Iranian women miserable or are all modernized? ... The answer is that they both exist, in all societies." [...] With his blog, Fazaeli is merely seeking to show the multi-faceted approaches to fashion in Iran.|$|R
40|$|Between 1945 and 2001 {{possibilities}} for homosexual men {{to move to}} the Netherlands improved considerably. This thesis examines how and why this development took place. In 1967 for the first time men were allowed to stay in the Netherlands officially, despite their sexuality. From 1974 partner migration became possible, allowing the foreign partner to stay 'because' of his sexuality. In 1981 the Netherlands was the first country that allowed asylum seekers to be granted refugee status {{on the basis of their}} sexuality. Main reasons for this change are the secularisation of the Netherlands, a liberalisation of family law, progressive politics in the 1970 s because of the social (and <b>sexual)</b> <b>revolutions</b> in the 1960 s. Also very important was the emergence of the gay emancipation movement in the Netherlands which became politically active in the 1970 s. Nevertheless, implementation of these novel opportunities to settle in the Netherlands proved more difficult. Local police forces applied their own moral judgments on immigrants and it took until the 1990 s before a homosexual asylum seeker was granted refugee status for his sexuality. This thesis therefore argues that the Netherlands wanted to show abroad how progressive its policies were, while practically, the results of the policies were not so progressive at all. Nevertheless, the Netherlands became to be known abroad as a safe haven for homosexual men. This was an image that the Dutch government tried to avoid in the 1960 s, while it embraced the image in the 1990 s. This thesis adds to the debate of policy change, as well as to the debate around the difference between policy and practice, taking immigration of homosexual men as a case study...|$|R

Fellow DVD Talk writer Adam Tyner described the season as [...] "virtually flawless", praising the depth with which each of the characters has been written. Andrew Johnston, writing in Time Out New York, praised the initial episode, stating: [...] "Inspired by cynical Eisenhower-era comedies of manners (Sweet Smell of Success, The Apartment) and the stories of John Cheever, frequent Sopranos writer Matthew Weiner's Mad Men is a scathing chronicle of the ad industry’s boozy midcentury heyday, and one of the freshest series to hit basic cable in years." ...|$|R
5|$|The Prison in Space by Dick Sharples, {{originally}} titled The Amazons, {{returned to}} the idea of a female-dominated planet last attempted with The Hidden Planet. The Doctor and Jamie were to be imprisoned, and Zoe was to start a <b>sexual</b> <b>revolution</b> and then be brainwashed. The four-part story was commissioned on 4 June 1968 and was intended to inject humour into the show. It was to feature Jamie in drag and end with Jamie deprogramming Zoe by smacking her bottom. The serial was rewritten to accommodate Frazer Hines' desire to leave by introducing a new companion named Nik, and again when he later decided to stay. Scripts for the first two episodes were delivered on 27 August 1968. The production team became unhappy with the serial, and when Sharples refused to perform further rewrites, the serial was dropped. The story was replaced by The Krotons. It was later adapted as Prison in Space by Simon Guerrier for Big Finish's The Lost Stories series in December 2010. In 2011, an illustrated scriptbook was released by Nothing at the End of the Lane.|$|E

40|$|The oneliner ‘No sex {{under my}} roof’ {{is used to}} {{reinforce}} the rule of premarital abstinence of sexuality until teenage children marry or move from home. In the USA, most parents still stick to this norm, whereas in the Netherlands since the late 1960 s, a new rule developed, allowing teenage children to have sex, provided they ‘feel strongly for each other’ and feel ‘ready’ for it. This paper describes and compares developments in the USA and in the Netherlands since the 1880 s, focusing on the social regulation of teenage sexuality, and based mainly upon such sources as reference books and sexology studies. The paper proposes {{an explanation of the}} two trajectories from national differences in the functioning of good societies, particularly in the regulation of social competition and social mobility. The rise in the USA of a highly competitive dating system and a complicated sexual morality indicates a smaller decline of power differences between classes, genders and generations, which partly explains the persistence of the old rule. Further explanation is found in America’s lower level of social integration and more open competition between various centres of power and good societies. The build up to the rise of a new rule among Dutch parents was an informalization of ‘getting engaged’, the diffusion of verkering (going steady) and of parental policies to stay ‘in the scene’, indicating higher levels of social integration and larger declines of power differences between classes, genders and generations. Yet, the long preservation of a homogeneous good society created a widening gap between a facade of decency and backstage realities. When this gap was washed away in the 1960 s Expressive and <b>Sexual</b> <b>Revolutions,</b> it also washed away the old rule, and increasing numbers of parents allowed their teenagers openly to have sex, even at home...|$|R

5000|$|Regarded as {{something}} of a [...] novelty, Star Maidens tuned in to the <b>sexual</b> equality <b>revolution</b> of the time, and features some female dominance elements.

Although Star Maidens was shot at Bray Studios by a different production company and did not benefit from as large a budget, both series featured the work of production designer Keith Wilson, whose props and set designs from Space:1999 were adapted for Star Maidens, leading to a very similar look and feel.

50|$|The 1960s {{fundamentally}} {{changed the}} Catholic student body at Cornell and the Cornell Newman Club. Overall societal changes, {{such as the}} <b>sexual</b> and cultural <b>revolutions</b> in the U.S., combined with new currents of thought and spirituality springing out of the reforms of the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) to create a period of intense discourse and activity over what the role and meaning of the Church was, across the nation and at Cornell. The size of the overall Cornell student body grew and, along with other Ivy League universities, Cornell became more open to people from more diverse backgrounds and less elite social classes. This resulted in a marked {{increase in the number}} of Catholic students at Cornell. In 1970 the Newman Club was renamed the Cornell Catholic Community, marking the Catholic group's development into a full-fledged parish. This reflected a widespread move away from the social-club structure of previous Catholic college organizations and towards a campus ministry structure. The move to self-identify as a 'campus ministry', a term already in widespread use by Protestant groups, reflected the ever more widespread cultural diffusion between Catholics and Protestants taking place as the 20th century unfolded.|$|R
40|$|Hospitality, in {{particular}} hospitality to strangers, was promoted {{in the eighteenth}} century as a universal human virtue, but writing of the period reveals many telling examples of its abuse. Through analysis of encounters across cultural and sexual divides, Judith Still revisits the current debate about the social, moral and political values of the Enlightenment. Focussing on (in) hospitality in relation to two kinds of exotic Other, Judith Still examines representations of indigenous peoples of the New World, both as hosts and as cannibals, and of the Moslem âOrientalâ in Persia and Turkey, associated with both the caravanserai (where travellers rest) and the harem. She also explores very different examples of Europeans as hosts and the practice of âadoptionâ, particularly that of young girls. The position of women in hospitality, hitherto neglected in favour of questions of cultural difference, is central to these analyses, and Still considers the work of women writers alongside more canonical male-authored texts. In this thought-provoking study, Judith Still uncovers how the Enlightenment rhetoric of openness and hospitality is compromised by self-interest; the questions it raises about attitudes to difference and freedom are equally relevant today. 1.

40|$|By all accounts, the Model Penal Code is {{enormously}} respected and influential. Yet, relatively {{soon after the}} Code 2 ̆ 7 s 1962 publication, the Code 2 ̆ 7 s sexual offense provisions and even its 1980 revised Commentaries were already considered outdated. The rapid onslaught of the <b>sexual</b> and feminist <b>revolutions</b> of the 1960 s and 1970 s brought an intense momentum to change rape laws that the Code had, in part, either mirrored or inspired. Only because of the passage of time, the Code 2 ̆ 7 s sexual offense provisions and Commentaries now misrepresent the progressive thinking of the Code 2 ̆ 7 s reporters. For these reasons, I think the Model Penal Code 2 ̆ 7 s sexual offense provisions should be pulled, revised, and replaced. With such a recommendation in mind, this essay has two goals: it explains why {{a number of the}} Code 2 ̆ 7 s sexual offense provisions were so advanced when they were created, but also why their continuing, unaltered existence makes their original virtues too easy to forget. What started as a leading authority for the legal enhancement of women and homosexuals is now a relic that detracts from the credit and foresight that its creators deserve. Periodically, the Code 2 ̆ 7 s Commentaries acknowledged that the sexual offense provisions would at some point need redrafting {{to keep pace with the}} times. For these reasons, a primary source of support for my pull-and-replace recommendations are the contents of the Commentaries themselves...|$|R
