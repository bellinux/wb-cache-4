40|$|A <b>stuffing</b> <b>tube</b> {{integrity}} checking assembly includes {{first and second}} annular seals, with each seal adapted to be positioned about a <b>stuffing</b> <b>tube</b> penetration component. An annular inflation bladder is provided, the bladder having a slot extending longitudinally there along and including a separator for sealing the slot. A first valve is in fluid communication with the bladder for introducing pressurized fluid to the space defined by the bladder when mounted about the tube. First and second releasible clamps are provided. Each clamp assembly is positioned about the bladder for securing the bladder {{to one of the}} seals for thereby establishing a fluid-tight chamber about the tube...|$|E
50|$|While many models use a {{combination}} of switches and/or relays physically actuated by servos to control the propulsion system, most newer models now use either Electronic Speed Control units or solid-state switching boards, such as those found in Robot combat, greatly reducing the complexity of the wiring of the propulsion system. Propulsion is provided by electric motors coupled to shafts passing through <b>stuffing</b> <b>tubes</b> driving semi-scale propellers. All active mechanical systems are required to be operated via electrical or pneumatic means. Any and all mechanisms relying upon chemical combustion which could contaminate the water with fuels, oils, or other chemicals are banned.|$|R

25|$|The American Revolutionary War {{broke out}} when the two young Rosses {{had been married for}} only two years. As a member of the local Pennsylvania Provincial Militia and its units from the city of Philadelphia, John Ross was {{assigned}} to guard munitions and, according to one legend, was killed by a gunpowder explosion, but family sources have doubts about this claim. The 24-year-old Elizabeth ("Betsy") continued working in the upholstery business repairing uniforms and making tents, blankets, and <b>stuffed</b> paper <b>tube</b> cartridges with musket balls for prepared packaged ammunition in 1779 for the Continental Army.|$|R
50|$|Permethrin kills ticks and {{mosquitoes}} on {{contact with}} treated clothing. A method of reducing deer tick populations by treating rodent vectors involves <b>stuffing</b> biodegradable cardboard <b>tubes</b> with permethrin-treated cotton. Mice collect the cotton for lining their nests. Permethrin on the cotton instantly kills any immature ticks feeding on the mice.|$|R
30|$|Test fungi were {{activated}} by inoculating the test fungi onto test tubes filled with PDA substrate, and cultivating {{for several days}} at the temperature of 28  ±  2 °C and relative humidity of 90  ±  5 %. Purified water was prepared by infusing 10  ml water into test <b>tube,</b> <b>stuffing</b> with cotton plug, and wrapping in kraft, enlacing with cotton string, then sterilizing at 121 °C, 0.1  MPa for 30  min.|$|R
5000|$|Jukyeom (Korean: 죽염, Hanja: 竹鹽) is a Korean folk remedy {{consisting}} of salt roasted in bamboo. Sea salt is <b>stuffed</b> into bamboo <b>tubes,</b> and the ends plugged with mineral-rich clay; the assembly is roasted up {{to as many}} as nine times in a pine-wood kiln. The trace elements in the clay and bamboo are thought to make this form of salt more healthy. [...] Historically, jukyeom {{has been used as a}} digestive aid, styptic, disinfectant, or dentifrice.|$|R
50|$|Go Sankei advocates {{an ingenious}} : <b>tubes</b> <b>stuffed</b> with honey and hornets should be {{prepared}}, and when Coxinga's forces prepared to retreat, dropped for the Tartar hordes to greedily open; whereupon {{they would be}} stung unmercifully and disarrayed. This opening would then {{become the focus of}} their true assault. Should they catch on, and attempt to burn the tubes en masse, the gunpowder placed {{in the bottom of the}} tubes against just such an occasion would explode them to bits.|$|R
5000|$|Plastic Tubes : Tube {{containers}} {{can also}} be produced in plastic, most commonly PE. The use of plastic tubes is very popular for the storage of Cosmetics such as hand creams etc. and also some food <b>stuffs.</b> The plastic <b>tube</b> retains its shape after each [...] "squeeze" [...] unlike laminate tubes such as toothpaste tubes. Plastic tubes {{can also be}} highly decorated or have a special additive such as soft touch to make the tube more appealing during use or point of sale (POS).|$|R
50|$|Compost berms {{and socks}} are used {{alone or in}} {{conjunction}} with compost blankets to mitigate the impact of high volume water discharges and flows. Compost berms are more aesthetically pleasing than silt fences and eliminate the need to remove the berm when the project is complete. Over time, a compost berm simply biodegrades {{and returns to the}} earth. As the name implies, a compost sock is a mesh <b>tube</b> <b>stuffed</b> with compost. Socks stand up better to heavy equipment, can be anchored in place, and are easily removed/reused. If a biodegradable fiber is used for the sock, it can also be left in place to biodegrade. This is rarely if ever practiced, however, since it defeats the idea of the sock.|$|R
50|$|Historically speaking, {{fresh produce}} is often scarce for {{hunter-gatherer}} nomadic tribes around the world, {{thus it is}} usually preserved out of necessity for important events and festivals. The tribal peoples of Sabah and Sarawak are no different - {{most of them have}} developed age-old techniques for curing, fermenting or preserving their supplies of fresh meat, fruit and vegetables. For example, during festive occasions the Murut people of Sabah would serve tamba (jeruk or jaruk in the Malay language) made from fresh raw wild boar or river fish, which is <b>stuffed</b> in bamboo <b>tubes</b> along with rice and salt and left to ferment for a few weeks, a technique which is also practised by the Lun Bawang people across the border in Sarawak. Fermented products are also frequently used as a cooking ingredient besides eaten on its own. Dayak households in Sarawak may saute their version of fermented meat with garlic and tapioca leaves (either fresh or pickled), and fermented tempoyak is a popular cooking seasoning.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, Corral {{was named}} by Miami New Times as “Best Commie Agent”, an ironic {{allusion to the}} {{extensive}} slander and libel that befell Corral following his investigations of how the U.S. government was misspending {{hundreds of millions of}} taxpayer dollars to promote democracy in Cuba. It reads: “That damn Oscar Corral. First he writes a story informing Miami residents that ten South Florida journalists are on the payrolls of U.S. propaganda vehicles Radio and TV Martí. Then he has the nerve to tell us that none of the $55.5 million in taxpayer money intended to fund Cuban dissidents has reached the island in cash. Instead the bulk was spent in Miami and Washington, or on exorbitant bills to ship goods to the island. And then he reports that most of that local spending was done without oversight or competitive bidding, and that the goods purchased for anti-Castro activists to foster democracy included Nintendo Game Boys, a chainsaw, Sony PlayStations, cashmere sweaters, a mountain bike, Godiva chocolates, and crabmeat. He may have been leaking fecal matter and <b>stuffed</b> with <b>tubes,</b> but there was only one man behind this, and he wears an Adidas track jacket and has a beard. Thank God for the freelance columnist at El Nuevo Herald, Nicolas Perez Diaz-Arguelles, who finally put two and two together and took the leap of faith to insinuate what was on all of our minds: Oscar Corral is a Cuban spy. The writer's editor may have cried [...] "blood libel," [...] but {{when it comes down to}} it, newspapers are irrelevant to a democracy. Eating truffles while playing Grand Theft Auto, That's a slap in Castro's face.” ...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} on the quality changes in surimi prepared from ice stored Queen fish (Chorinemus lysan) in time interval during 20 days of storage in ice storage condition and {{the ratio of the}} fish to ice was maintained 1 : 1. Mince was prepared in both washed and unwashed condition. To evaluate the gel-forming characteristics, a portion of the mince was washed with water containing 0. 1 % NaCl. Both washed and unwashed mince were ground with 3 % NaCl for 20 min at 4 �C. The ground paste was <b>stuffed</b> into polyethylene <b>tube</b> and incubated at various temperatures (40, 50 and 60 �C) for 2 h. The quality changes during ice storage of mince prepared from the ice stored fish muscle were evaluated with time interval by determining the gel-forming ability, myofibrillar Ca 2 + -ATPase activity, protein solubility and pH value of fish muscle. The resulting gels were subjected to the puncture test, teeth cutting test and folding test. Maximum breaking force was obtained from both washed and unwashed mince at the incubation temperature of � 50 �C. The gel strength �of �both unwashed �and �washed meat paste gradually declined with lapse of storage period and washed meat paste showed higher gel forming ability than unwashed meat paste throughout the study period. Myofibrillar Ca 2 + -ATPase activity, protein solubility and pH of the ice stored muscles decreased from 0. 847 to 0. 309 �mol pi min 1 mg 1, 87 to 12 % and 6. 69 to 5. 89, respectively, during 20 days of ice storage...|$|R
