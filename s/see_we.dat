In his memoirs, Kennan recalled, [...] "So far as I could <b>see,</b> <b>we</b> were expecting {{to be able to}} gain our objectives... without making any concessions though, only 'if we were really all-powerful, and could hope to get away with it.'

One such character was Mrs. Kelly, a gossip.

500|$|Once Newman and Robbins signed on, PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and Working Title Films {{agreed to}} co-finance the film with Warner Bros. and Silver Pictures. The film was shot on five sound stages at Carolco Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina {{beginning}} on November 30, 1992. Raimi served as second unit director, shooting the hula hoop sequence and Waring Hudsucker's suicide. Production designer Dennis Gassner {{was influenced by}} fascist architecture, particularly the work of Albert Speer, [...] as well as Terry Gilliam's Brazil (1985), Frank Lloyd Wright and the Art Deco movement. [...] Gassner contemplated using five huge rooms needed to accommodate the sound stages. Gassner noted [...] "You <b>see,</b> <b>we</b> wanted things to be big." [...] He said that the huge 1950's-inspired table up in the boardroom was so long, {{it had to be}} built in five sections and later on assembled on the soundstage. The intention for the set sizes was to generate an oppressive feel. Principal photography ended on March 18, 1993.|$|E
500|$|The first writers {{assigned}} to the script were twins Julius and Philip Epstein who, against the wishes of Warner Brothers, left at Frank Capra's request early in 1942 {{to work on the}} Why We Fight series in Washington, D.C. While they were gone, the other credited writer, Howard Koch, was assigned; he produced thirty to forty pages. When the Epstein brothers returned after about a month, they were re{{assigned to}} Casablanca and—contrary to what Koch claimed in two published books—his work was not used. The Epstein brothers and Koch never worked in the same room at the same time during the writing of the script. Koch later commented, [...] "When we began, we didn't have a finished script... Ingrid Bergman came to me and said, 'Which man should I love more...?' I said to her, 'I don't know... play them both evenly.' You <b>see</b> <b>we</b> didn't have an ending, so we didn't know what was going to happen!" [...] In the final budget for the film, the Epsteins were paid $30,416, and Koch earned $4,200.|$|E

500|$|Back in London at M's office, Bond is {{informed}} that Blofeld intends {{to hold the}} world to ransom by threatening to destroy its agriculture using his brainwashed women. Apart from money, Blofeld demands amnesty for all past crimes and to be recognised as Count de Bleuchamp. M tells 007 that the ransom will be paid and forbids him to mount a rescue mission. Bond then enlists Draco and his forces to attack Blofeld's headquarters, while also rescuing Tracy from Blofeld's captivity. The facility is destroyed, and Blofeld escapes the destruction alone in a bobsleigh, with Bond pursuing him. The chase ends when Blofeld becomes snared in a tree branch and injures his neck. Bond and Tracy marry in Portugal, then drive away in Bond's Aston Martin. When Bond pulls over to the roadside to remove flowers from the car, Blofeld (wearing a neck brace) and Bunt open fire on the couple's car. Bond survives, but Tracy is killed in the attack.
