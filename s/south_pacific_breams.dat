40|$|Nations of the <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> face {{a number}} of major {{challenges}} with respect to sustainable tourism development. Much of the literature presents overtly pessimistic conceptualisations of <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> nations as environmentally vulnerable and economically dependent. This paper argues that the narrative concerning sustainable tourism development in the <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> is incomplete and the predominant narrative viewing the <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> nations as economically and environmentally vulnerable is too simplistic. Additionally, this paper challenges the narrative that high or mass levels of tourism within the <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> cannot be sustainable. Based on experience derived from operational experience and consultancy, this paper provides insights into the challenges and possibilities for sustainable tourism development in the <b>South</b> <b>Pacific...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{authors have}} in this paper studied the {{differences}} of ocean circulations between the <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean and the South Atlantic Ocean. The Subtropical gyre in the <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> reaches to higher latitude than that in the South Atlantic because the maximum westerlies in the <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> are at higher latitude {{than those in the}} South Atlantic. The low latitude region of the <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> is considerably wider than that of the South. Atlantic. Under the assumption of same current velocity in both low latitude regions, {{the western part of the}} low latitude region of the <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> accepts more effective heat energy transferred from atmosphere to surface water than that of the South Atlantic. Hence, the temperature of the western part of the tropical <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> is higher than of the western part of the South Atlantic. From this analysis it is seen that the Subpolar gyre in the South Atlantic reaches further north than that in the <b>South</b> <b>Pacific.</b> The fact that water temperature of the South Atlantic is lower than that of the <b>South</b> <b>Pacific</b> may be explained by the differences of the ranges of Subtropical and Subpolar gyres in both oceans and effective heat energy transferred from atmosphere to surface water in both tropical regions...|$|R
