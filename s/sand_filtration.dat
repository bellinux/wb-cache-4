40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the {{experimental}} evaluation of different friction factor correlations for water flow through packed beds of spherical and non-spherical particles at ambient temperature. The experiments were performed by measuring the pressure drop across the bed. Packed beds made of monosized glass spherical particles of seven different diameters were used, as well as beds made of 16 fractions of quartz <b>filtration</b> <b>sand</b> obtained by sieving (polydisperse non-spherical particles). The range of bed voidages was 0. 359 – 0. 486, while the range of bed particle Reynolds numbers was from 0. 3 to 286 for spherical particles and from 0. 1 to 50 for non-spherical particles. The obtained results were compared using a number of available literature correlations. In order to improve the correlation results for spherical particles, a new simple equation was proposed {{in the form of}} Ergun’s equation, with modified coefficients. The new correlation had a mean absolute deviation between experimental and calculated values of pressure drop of 9. 04 %.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} the comparison between two filtration systems, being one composed of a boulder pre-filter followed by a slow filter with <b>sand</b> as <b>filtration</b> media and a non-woven synthetic fabric in the upper part, and the other one composed of a boulder pre-filter followed by a slow filter with <b>sand</b> as <b>filtration</b> media and granular activated charcoal and a non-woven synthetic fabric in the upper part, for the purification of household effluents treated in cultivated beds, to be applied in fertigation. The filtration systems were compared to assess the efficiency in the removal of the parameters: suspended solids, turbidity, apparent color, chemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, iron, manganese, total coliforms and E. coli. The two systems operated 24 hours a day, with the same application rate, treating a total final flow of 1. 5 m 3 day- 1, while the application rate for the pre-filtration unit was 8. 4 m 3 m- 2 day- 1 on average and for each of the slow filtration units it was 2. 7 m 3 m- 2 day- 1 on average. The pre-filtration and slow filtration units were efficient in the reduction of suspended solids concentrations, turbidity, apparent color and COD, for the purification of previously treated domestic sewage. The use of granular activated charcoal combined with sand in the slow filter allowed a higher efficiency in the removal of suspended solids, color, turbidity, total coliforms and E.
