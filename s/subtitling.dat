5|$|National {{legislation}} {{requires that}} all television programmes broadcasts in Croatia {{are made in}} Croatian language or with appropriate translations either using dubbing or <b>subtitling.</b> In general, all foreign programming is subtitled, except for cartoons and narrated parts of documentaries and similar programmes. An attempt to change this was made by Nova TV in 2006, when a soap opera was dubbed, but the move provoked negative response from viewers and critics, causing the experiment to be abandoned. The legislation does not provide for mutually intelligible languages. That led to formal requests made by the Electronic Media Council demanding language localisation of television programmes made in Serbian language. Ultimately, that issue was resolved through <b>subtitling</b> using teletext service normally used for closed captioning.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of sound films before dubbing and <b>subtitling,</b> one way to present a film to a foreign {{audience}} was to record the film with a translated screenplay with foreign-language cast. As this was a time consuming and expensive procedure, most filmmakers who did this tended to only make one alternative language feature. Producer Seymour Nebenzal felt that creating this alternative version would enhance international sales for The Testament of Dr. Mabuse. The French-language screenplay was adapted by René Sti. Lang was fluent in French and directed The Testament of Dr. Mabuse in both French and German. Actor Karl Meixner played Hofmeister in both versions of the film as he was bilingual. Rudolf Klein-Rogge also features as Mabuse in the French version with his lines being dubbed. The French version, titled Le Testament du Dr. Mabuse, was edited by Lothar Wolff in France while the film was still in production.|$|E
5|$|Odex {{blamed the}} {{approximate}} 70% fall in its Video CD (VCD) and Digital Video Disc (DVD) sales in 2006 and 2007 on illegal downloading. The response of anime fans {{was that the}} fall in sales was because Odex's products were inferior, inaccurately translated, and released later than the online versions. Odex subsequently attributed the inaccurate <b>subtitling</b> on censorship laws against mature themes (such as yaoi) and on fansubbers—anime fans who had translated the Japanese dialogue—whom they had hired. In response, the Board of Film Censors said {{that it did not}} ask for subtitles to be changed, that it merely classified content, and that the onus was on distributors to ensure accurate subtitles. In addition to problems of quality and scheduling, criticisms were directed at Odex's litigious strategy and poor public relations. Odex received support from the Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore (AVPAS) in making its demands for compensation.|$|E

25|$|Real-time {{translation}} <b>subtitling,</b> {{usually involves}} an interpreter and a stenographer working concurrently, whereby the former quickly translates to the dialog {{while the latter}} types; this form of <b>subtitling</b> is rare. The unavoidable delay, typing errors, lack of editing, and high cost mean that real-time translation <b>subtitling</b> is in low demand. Allowing the interpreter to directly speak to the viewers is usually both cheaper and quicker; however, the translation is not accessible {{to people who are}} deaf and hard–of–hearing.|$|E
25|$|Arab Middle East and North Africa -- Modern Standard Arabic-language <b>subtitling,</b> {{used for}} foreign programming/cinema and often used when Arabic dialects {{are the primary}} medium of a film/TV program.

25|$|Same Language <b>Subtitling</b> (SLS) {{is the use}} of Synchronized Captioning of Musical Lyrics (or any {{text with}} an Audio/Video/ source) as a Repeated Reading {{activity}}. The basic reading activity involves students viewing a short subtitled presentation projected onscreen, while completing a response worksheet. To be really effective, the <b>subtitling</b> should have high quality synchronization of audio and text, and better yet, <b>subtitling</b> should change color in syllabic synchronization to audio model, and the text should be at a level to challenge students' language abilities.|$|E
25|$|<b>Subtitles</b> {{exist in}} two forms; open <b>subtitles</b> are 'open to all' and cannot {{be turned off}} by the viewer; closed <b>subtitles</b> are {{designed}} for a certain group of viewers, and can usually be turned on/off or selected by the viewer – examples being teletext pages, US Closed captions (608/708), DVB Bitmap <b>subtitles,</b> DVD/Blu-ray <b>subtitles.</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>Subtitles</b> {{are stored}} as bitmap images and {{therefore}} can contain messages in any language. <b>Subtitles</b> are restricted to four colors, including transparent [...] "color", and thus tend to look cruder than permanent <b>subtitles</b> on film. Transparency allows laying <b>subtitles</b> over the video during playback. The <b>subtitle</b> tracks are contained within the VOB file of the DVD.|$|R
25|$|In some East Asian countries, such as China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, <b>subtitling</b> {{is common}} in all taped {{television}} programs. In these countries, written text remains mostly uniform while regional dialects in the spoken form can be mutually unintelligible. Therefore, <b>subtitling</b> offers a distinct advantage to aid comprehension. With subtitles, programs in Putonghua, the standard Mandarin, or any dialect can be understood by viewers unfamiliar with it.|$|E

25|$|In India, Same Language <b>Subtitling</b> (SLS) {{are common}} for films and music videos. SLS {{refers to the}} idea of <b>subtitling</b> in the same {{language}} as the audio. SLS is highlighted karaoke style, that is, to speech. The idea of SLS was initiated to shore up literacy rates as SLS makes reading practice an incidental, automatic, and subconscious part of popular TV entertainment. This idea was well received by the Government of India which now uses SLS on several national channels, including Doordarshan.|$|E
40|$|<b>Subtitles</b> (closed captions) on {{television}} are typically {{placed at the}} bottom-centre of the screen. However, placing <b>subtitles</b> in varying positions, according to the underlying video content ('dynamic subtitles'), {{has the potential to}} make the overall viewing experience less disjointed and more immersive. This paper describes the testing of such <b>subtitles</b> with hearing-impaired users, and a new analysis of previously collected eye-tracking data. The qualitative data demonstrates that dynamic <b>subtitles</b> can lead to an improved User Experience, although not for all types of <b>subtitle</b> user. The eye-tracking data was analysed to compare the gaze patterns of <b>subtitle</b> users with a baseline of those for people viewing without <b>subtitles.</b> It was found that gaze patterns of people watching dynamic <b>subtitles</b> were closer to the baseline than those of people watching with traditional <b>subtitles.</b> Finally, some of the factors that need to be considered when authoring dynamic <b>subtitles</b> are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Computer Aided Translation (CAT) tools help editors {{translate}} documents such as <b>subtitles</b> {{quicker and}} more efficiently. These tools vary from platform specific, multi-platform or web based editors. Some editors lack features that translators may find beneficial such as focus on post-editing <b>subtitle</b> translation, a possibility to collaborate {{on the same}} document or versioning of <b>subtitle</b> edits. This thesis builds on a web-based <b>subtitle</b> editor FilmTit and adds new features such as saving <b>subtitle</b> revisions, simultaneous editing, optional post-editing column, search and replace and a better video player. The resulting <b>subtitle</b> editor provides a more efficient way to collaborate and translate <b>subtitles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Language {{learners}} {{often use}} <b>subtitled</b> videos {{to help them}} learn. However, standard <b>subtitles</b> are geared more towards comprehension than vocabulary learning, as translations are nonliteral and are provided only for phrases, not vocabu-lary. This paper presents Smart <b>Subtitles,</b> which are inter-active <b>subtitles</b> tailored towards vocabulary learning. Smart <b>Subtitles</b> can be automatically generated from common video sources such as <b>subtitled</b> DVDs. They provide features such as vocabulary definitions on hover, and dialog-based video navigation. In our pilot study with intermediate learners studying Chinese, participants correctly defined over twice as many new words in a post-viewing vocabulary test when they used Smart <b>Subtitles,</b> compared to dual Chinese-English <b>subtitles.</b> Learners spent {{the same amount of}} time watching clips with each tool, and enjoyed viewing videos with Smart <b>Subtitles</b> as much as with dual <b>subtitles.</b> Learners understood videos equally well using either tool, as indicated by self-assessments and independent evaluations of their summaries.

25|$|Sometimes, mainly at film festivals, {{subtitles}} may {{be shown}} on a separate display below the screen, thus saving the film-maker from creating a subtitled copy for perhaps just one showing.

25|$|Dubbing {{is still}} the norm and favored form in these four countries, but the {{proportion}} of <b>subtitling</b> is slowly growing, mainly to save cost and turnaround-time, but also due to a growing acceptance among younger generations, who are better readers and increasingly have a basic knowledge of English (the dominant language in film and TV) and thus prefer to hear the original dialogue.|$|E

2500|$|The only {{significant}} difference for the user between SDH <b>subtitles</b> and closed captions is their appearance: SDH <b>subtitles</b> usually are displayed {{with the same}} proportional font used for the translation <b>subtitles</b> on the DVD; however, closed captions are displayed as white text on a black band, which blocks {{a large portion of}} the view. Closed captioning is falling out of favor as many users have no difficulty reading SDH <b>subtitles,</b> which are text with contrast outline. In addition, DVD <b>subtitles</b> can specify many colors, on the same character: primary, outline, shadow, and background. This allows subtitlers to display <b>subtitles</b> on a usually translucent band for easier reading; however, this is rare, since most <b>subtitles</b> use an outline and shadow instead, in order to block a smaller portion of the picture. Closed captions may still supersede DVD <b>subtitles,</b> since many SDH <b>subtitles</b> present all of the text centered, while closed captions usually specify position on the screen: centered, left align, right align, top, etc. This is helpful for speaker identification and overlapping conversation. Some SDH [...] <b>subtitles</b> (such as the <b>subtitles</b> of newer Universal Studios DVDs/Blu-ray Discs) do have positioning, but it is not as common.|$|R
