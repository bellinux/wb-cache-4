The repetition rate of the laser is about 209 MHz. By controlling an intra-cavity electro-optic modulator and a piezo-transducer, the repetition rate can be stabilized with high servo bandwidth {{in a range of}} 3 kHz, enabling long-term repetition rate phase-locking. The in-loop frequency stability of repetition rate is about 1. 6 E- 13 at 1 second integration time, limited by the measurement system; and it is inversely proportional to integration time in short term. Furthermore, using a common path f- 2 f interferometer, the carrier envelope offset frequency of the frequency comb is obtained with a signal-to-noise ratio of 40 dB in 3 MHz resolution bandwidth. <b>Stabilized</b> <b>carrier</b> envelope offset frequency exhibits a deviation of 0. 6 mHz at 1 second integration time.

40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that the use of}} the {{properties}} of collective dynamics may be effective for solution of the problem of generation of chaotically modulated oscillations. 1. The idea of using chaotic self-oscillations as carri-ers in communication systems that was put forward in was recently intensively discussed in the litera-ture. Dynamical chaotic oscillations are the kinds of wideband and ultrawideband signals. Chaotic os-cillations provide rich opportunities for controlling and modulation. These are the reasons which make them highly promising in the communication field of research. Traditional communication systems with regular os-cillations as carriers are usually based on phase-locked loops (PLL). Such systems allow effective so-lution of the whole complex of problems arising at transmission and reception of information, namely, generation of <b>stabilized</b> <b>carrier</b> oscillations, modu-lation of carrier oscillations by information signal, optimal noise filtration, and others. There arises a question: Is it possible to construct PLL-based non-traditional promising communication systems with chaotic oscillations as carriers? Specifically, can PLL be a useful tool for generation and synchronization of carrier chaotic oscillations that is the key task in communication systems? This problem is very scant-ily considered in the literature. The present work is concerned with generation of carrier chaotic oscilla-tions using PLL. 2. A phase system is a typical system for automatic control of generator frequency that is intended for locking of periodic oscillations of a voltage controlled generator in the PLL by a reference oscillation. The mathematical model of such a phase system is gen-erally written in the form: p...|$|E
40|$|The {{climate of}} Mars {{is a major}} focus of Mars exploration. With the loss of MCO, however, it remains {{uncertain}} how it will be achieved. We argue that a truly dedicated climate mission to Mars should have both orbital and landed components, and that these should operate simultaneously for at least 1 Mars year if not longer. Pascal is a Discovery mission that emphasizes the landed component. Its principal goal is to establish a network of 24 small weather stations on the surface of Mars that will operate for 2 Mars years, with an extended mission option for an additional 8 Mars years bringing the total mission lifetime up to 10 Mars years. The stations will collect hourly measurements of pressure, temperature, and optical depth. After delivering the probes to Mars, Pascal's carrier spacecraft will go into an elliptical orbit which will serve as a relay for the landers, and a platform for synoptic imaging. These simultaneous measurements from the surface and from orbit will allow us to characterize the planet's general circulation and its interaction with the dust, water, and CO 2 cycles. During entry, descent, and landing, each of Pascal's 24 probes will also measure the temperature structure of the atmosphere and acquire images of the surface. These data will allow us to determine the global structure of the atmosphere between 15 and 130 km, and characterize the local terrain to help interpret the landed data. The descent images are part of Pascal's outreach program, as the probe camera system will be developed by faculty-supervised student project. The intent is to generate enthusiasm for the Pascal mission by directly involving students. Pascal will be launched on a Delta II- 7925 in August of 2005. A type I trajectory will deliver Pascal to Mars in January of 2006. On approach, the three-axis <b>stabilized</b> <b>carrier</b> spacecraft will spring deploy the Pascal probes in 4 separate salvo's of 6 each. Global coverage is achieved with small time-of-arrival adjustments in between each salvo. Pascal's probes utilize an aeroshell, parachute, and crushable material for entry, descent and landing. On the surface, their long life and global coverage is enabled by a Micro Thermal Power Source with demonstrated heritage. After all probes are released, the carrier spacecraft will execute a small burn for insertion into an elliptical orbit. The long lifetime of the Pascal network was chosen in part to maximize the chances that orbital sounding, like that planned with MCO, would occur {{at some point during the}} mission. If Pascal is selected for launch in ' 05, this could occur if MCO-like science is reflown in the ' 05 opportunity or, if it is reflown in ' 03, the mission is extended to overlap with Pascal.

The mechanisms leading to increased FVIII levels and cellular sites of this enhanced FVIII production are poorly understood. We studied the effect of total hepatectomy in pigs, a large-animal model of FHF, on the expression of plasma and tissue FVIII during 24 -hour follow-up. Tissue FVIII expression was determined before and 24 h after hepatectomy, both at the mRNA level and immunohistochemically.

Total hepatectomy elicited a gradual and sustained twofold elevation of circulating FVIII, whereas FVIII mRNA levels in various organs did not increase after hepatectomy.

The increase in the half-life of FVIII and increased levels of VWF were not sufficient to explain the rise in plasma FVIII levels. At the protein level, prominent changes in the cellular distribution of FVIII were seen in spleen and kidney.

40|$|Abstract—Inside a {{femtosecond}} laser oscillator, no coupling mechanism between the propagation speeds of the carrier and the pulse envelope exists. Therefore, the relative delay between carrier and envelope of a femtosecond oscillator will exhibit irregular fluctuations unless this jitter is actively suppressed. Both intensity and beam pointing {{fluctuations in the}} laser can introduce carrier-envelope phase changes. Based on our analysis, we are capable of reducing or avoiding certain mechanisms by proper design of the laser cavity. We use such an optimized cavity to <b>stabilize</b> the <b>carrier</b> envelope-phase to an external reference oscillator with a long-term residual jitter corresponding to only 10 attoseconds in a (100 kHz– 0. 01 Hz) bandwidth. This is the smallest long-term timing jitter of a {{femtosecond laser}} oscillator demonstrated to date.

However, when these vesicles are diluted, substances, such as ions, encapsulated in the aqueous cavity can be released due to vesicle disruption. In previous studies, we have shown that these vesicles can be loaded efficiently with sufficient quantities of radionuclides to allow application in radionuclide therapy and pharmacokinetics evaluation, provided that there is no loss of the encapsulated radionuclides when diluted in the bloodstream. In this paper, in order to <b>stabilize</b> the <b>carriers,</b> we propose to cross-link the hydrophobic part of the polymersome membrane and to investigate whether such cross-linking induced by γ radiation can enhance the retention of ions (radionuclides). Retention of ions encapsulated in the lumen in such cross-linked carriers has not been previously quantitatively evaluated, although it is of ultimate importance in any medical application. Here, we also investigate how cross-linking affects the transport of radionuclides (loading) through the membrane of the vesicles. The integrity of the vesicles {{as a function of the}} radiation dose is also investigated, including morphological changes. The results show that cross-linking hinders the transport of ions through the membrane, which also leads to higher retention of ions encapsulated prior to cross-linking in the vesicles. Electron micrographs show that the shape of the polymersomes is not greatly affected by γ radiation when left in the original solvent (phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or Milli-Q water), but when diluted in a good solvent for both blocks, i. e., tetrahydrofuran (THF), disintegration of the vesicles and the appearance of droplet-like structures is observed, which had not been reported previously.

Klotho regulates several cellular transporters. Klotho protein deficiency accelerates the appearance of age related disorders including neurodegeneration and muscle wasting and eventually leads to premature death. The main site of Klotho protein expression is the kidney. Klotho protein is also appreciably expressed in other tissues including chorioid plexus. The present study explored the effect of Klotho protein on the creatine transporter CreaT (Slc 6 A 8), which participates in the maintenance of neuronal function and survival. Methods: To this end cRNA encoding Slc 6 A 8 was injected into Xenopus oocytes with and without additional injection of cRNA encoding Klotho protein. Creatine transporter CreaT (Slc 6 A 8) activity was estimated from creatine induced current determined by two-electrode voltage-clamp. Results: Coexpression of Klotho protein significantly increased creatine-induced current in Slc 6 A 8 expressing Xenopus oocytes. Coexpression of Klotho protein delayed the decline of creatine induced current following inhibition of carrier insertion into the cell membrane by brefeldin A (5 µM). The increase of creatine induced current by coexpression of Klotho protein in Slc 6 A 8 expressing Xenopus oocytes was reversed by β-glucuronidase inhibitor (DSAL).

The efficient coupling of a classical force field that describes the liquid with a tight-binding model that represents the pi system of the organic layer permits the calculation of nanosecond length trajectories. The model predicts that the reorientation of water dipoles <b>stabilizes</b> positive charge <b>carriers</b> on average by 0. 6 eV and thus leads to a polaron trap state at the liquid interface. Thermal fluctuations of the water molecules provoke two-dimensional diffusive hopping of the charge carrier parallel to the interface with mobilities of up to 0. 6 cm(2) s(- 1) V- 1 and lead to an amorphous broadening of the valence-band tail. As a consequence, water-filled nanocavities act as trapping sites in pentacene transistors.

In {{the case of}} many group IV-VI, V, and related materials, these interactions are strong and the materials exist near electronic and structural phase transitions. Their close proximity to phase instability produces a fragile balance among the various properties. The prototypical example is PbTe whose incipient ferroelectric behaviour {{has been associated with}} large phonon anharmonicity and thermoelectricity. Experimental measurements on PbTe reveal anomalous lattice dynamics, especially in the soft transverse optical phonon branch. This has been interpreted in terms of both giant anharmonicity and local symmetry breaking due to off-centering of the Pb ions. The observed anomalies have prompted renewed theoretical and computational interest, which has in turn revived focus on the extent that electron-phonon interactions drive lattice instabilities in PbTe and related materials. Here, we use Fourier-transform inelastic x-ray scattering (FT-IXS) to show that photo-injection of free <b>carriers</b> <b>stabilizes</b> the paraelectric state. With support from constrained density functional theory (CDFT) calculations, we find that photoexcitation weakens the long-range forces along the cubic direction tied to resonant bonding and incipient ferroelectricity.

Ferrofluids are colloidal suspensions of magnetic particles <b>stabilized</b> in various <b>carrier</b> liquids. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the ferrofluid becomes magnetized as the particles align with the magnetic field. Potential applications of ferrofluids to subsurface contamination problems include magnetic guidance of reactants to contaminated target zones in the subsurface for in situ treatment or emplacement of containment barriers. Laboratory experiments of magnetically induced ferrofluid flow in porous media in this report demonstrate the potential for mobilizing ferrofluid and controlling fluid emplacement through control of the external magnetic field. The pressures measured in ferrofluid due to the attraction of ferrofluid to a permanent magnet agree well with calculated values. The results show that a predictable pressure gradient is produced in the fluid which is strong near the magnet and drops off quickly with distance. This pressure gradient drives the fluid through sand without significant loss of ferrofluid strength due to filtration or dilution. Flow visualization experiments of ferrofluid in water-filled horizontal Hele-Shaw cells demonstrate that ferrofluid obtains a consistent final arc-shaped configuration around the magnet regardless of initial configuration or flow path toward the magnet.

Two separate monomodal active (LWLa) and passive (LWLp) optic fibers are arranged on a horizontal plane. The passive optic fiber has two ports (A,B), and is coupled to the active fiber in an optical coupling zone (OKB). The active optic fiber is a laser (LAS) with one port (C) with a total mirror array (TOV) and a second port (D) with a partial mirror array (TEV). Port A or B is the entry for the data signal with the first carrier wavelength and the coupling zone length gives an amplified output of the data signal with the first carrier wavelength. Port D is the output port for the amplified and inverted data signal with the second carrier wavelength. The active optic fiber {{has at least one}} wavelength selective grid section (DBR) to <b>stabilize</b> the second <b>carrier</b> wavelength. USE - The optical wavelength converter is for use in increasing the flexibility of an optical communications network. ADVANTAGE - The system maintains a monomodal conversion with amplification stabilizing in a compact, simple and cost-effective converter module with a variety of applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{possible}} biotransformations in {{the blood}} serum of four representative insulin-enhancing vanadium compounds, [VO(6 -mepic) 2], cis-[VO(pic) 2 (H 2 O) ], [VO(acac) 2], and [VO(dhp) 2], where 6 -mepic, pic, acac, and dhp indicate the deprotonated forms of 6 -methylpicolinic and picolinic acids, acetylacetone, and 1, 2 -dimethyl- 3 -hydroxy- 4 (1 H) -pyridinone, were examined. In particular, {{the behavior of the}} quinary systems formed by the insulin-enhancing species, human serum apo-transferrin (hTf), human serum albumin (HSA), and lactate (lact) or citrate (citr) at physiological pH and conditions was studied. The results indicate that, besides the case in which the ligand is very weak like 6 -mepic, the carrier can interact in some form with VO 2 + ion until its intake into the cell. In fact with stronger ligands like pic, acac, and dhp, VO 2 + is transported not only by transferrin but also as [VO(carrier) 2] and as mixed species VO 2 + −hTF− carrier. There are two ways in which the undissociated form of a bis-chelated complex can interact with transferrin, one “specific” when the carrier possesses a carboxylate group and behaves like a synergistic anion, and another “non-specific” when an imidazole nitrogen of a histidine residue from hTf replaces an equatorially coordinated water molecule giving rise to a ternary species with cis-octahedral geometry and cis -VO(carrier) 2 (hTf) stoichiometry. It is found that also albumin can participate in the transport of an insulin-enhancing compound forming a mixed species cis -VO(carrier) 2 (HSA), when the <b>carrier</b> <b>stabilizes</b> in aqueous solution the cis -octahedral form, or the dinuclear compound (VO) 2 d HSA, when the carrier forms unstable complexes. These insights were confirmed through density functional theory (DFT) calculations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOrganic or {{inorganic}} colloids play a {{major role}} in the mobilization of trace elements in soils and waters. Environmental physicochemical parameters (pH, redox potential, temperature, pressure, ionic strength, etc.) are the controlling factors of the colloidal mobilization. This study was dedicated to follow the colloid-mediated mobilization of trace elements through time at the soil/water interface by means of an experimental approach. Soil column experiments were carried out using percolating synthetic solutions. The percolated solutions were ultrafiltrated with various decreasing cutoff thresholds to separate the different colloidal phases in which the dissolved organic carbon and trace element concentrations were measured. The major results which stem from this study are the following: (i) The data can be divided into different groups of organic compounds (microbial metabolites, fulvic acids, humic acids) with regard to their respective aromaticity and molecular weight. (ii) Three groups of elements can be distinguished based on their relationships with the colloidal phases: the first one corresponds to the so-called "truly" dissolved group (Li, B, K, Na, Rb, Si, Mg, Sr, Ca, Mn, Ba, and V). The second one can be considered as an intermediate group (Cu, Cd, Co, and Ni), while the third group gathers Al, Cr, U, Mo, Pb, Ti, Th, Fe, and rare earth elements (REE) carried by the organic colloidal pool. (iii) The data demonstrate that the fulvic acids seem to be a major organic carrier phase for trace elements such as Cu, Cd, Co, and Ni. By contrast, the trace elements belonging to the so-called colloidal pool were mostly mobilized by humic acids containing iron nanoparticles. Lead, Ti, and U were mobilized by iron nanoparticles bound to these humic acids. Thus, humic substances allowed directly or indirectly a colloidal transport of many insoluble trace elements either by binding trace elements or by <b>stabilizing</b> a ferric <b>carrier</b> phase. (iv) Finally, the results demonstrated also that REE were mostly mobilized by humic substances. The REE normalized patterns showed a middle REE downward concavity. Therefore, as previously shown elsewhere humic substances are a major control of REE speciation and REE fractionation patterns as well since the humic substance/metal ratio was the key parameter controlling the REE pattern shape...|$|R
