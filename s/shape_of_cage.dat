40|$|The {{enormous}} advances {{made possible}} by developments in molecular pharmacology, {{and the availability of}} refined preparations that provide exquisite control over many variables, make it very tempting to try and reduce the effects of psychoactive drugs to their direct actions on a receptor, following which a fixed series of intracellular reactions is initiated. The thesis of this article, however, is that the behavioral and psychological effects of psychoactive drugs cannot be reduced to the straightforward consequences of ligand–receptor binding, and attempts to do so neglect the complexity of drug actions. This is because, as put forward by Falk and Feingold, nearly two decades ago, ‘‘the behavioral action of a drug [is due to] a cluster of interactions among the pharmacological substance, the individual set of the organism, and the environmental setting’’; that is, the effects of drugs on behavioral and psychological functions are not only a consequence of the pharmacological effects of the drug, but also on {{the context in which the}} drug is experienced. Of course, it has long been known that the physical characteristics of the environment (e. g., in laboratory settings, the size and <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> <b>cage,</b> type of bedding, etc.) can have a large effect on the behavioral actions of drugs. However, of particular importance here is the notion that even when the physical characteristics of the environment are held constant, apparently subtle differences in the ‘psychological context’ powerfully modulate both the acute effects of psychoactive drugs on brain and behavior and, with repeated administration, the ability of these drugs to change the brain. This general theme is illustrated here by discussing a series of studies by Aldo Badiani, Terry Robinson, and colleagues concerning how the neurobehavioral effects of psychostimulant and opioid drugs are modulated by the circumstances surrounding their administration...|$|E

40|$|The {{translational}} {{motion of}} 4 -n-hexyl- 4 '-cyanobiphenyl (6 CB) in its isotropic phase {{has been studied}} by atomistic molecular dynamics simulation from 280 to 330 K. The mean square displacement shows evidence of a subdiffusive dynamics, with a plateau that becomes very apparent at the lowest temperatures. A three-time self-intermediate scattering function reveals that this plateau is connected with a homogeneous dynamics that, at longer times, becomes heterogeneous and finally exponential. These features are shared by, for example, a high-density system of hard spheres, which supports the universal character of the translational dynamics of liquids in their supercooled condition. As predicted by the idealized version of the mode-coupling theory (MCT), the diffusion coefficient dependence upon temperature is well described by a power law, with a critical temperature very close to that obtained by experimental measurements on orientational relaxation. This agreement might indicate a complete freezing of both rotational and translational intradomain dynamics. The time-temperature superposition principle also holds. The <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cage</b> that surrounds a 6 CB molecule has been reconstructed, and this analysis suggests a preferential side-by-side arrangement of molecules, which locally tend to align their long axes even in the isotropic phase...|$|R

High tension fully inhibits polymerization. Theoretically, we predict the tension values for which transitions between different clathrin coat shapes occur.

40|$|Molecules such as {{covalent}} cages can adopt several shapes, {{in which}} the ratio of starting materials is the same, {{but the number of}} starting materials, and the <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> the resulting molecule is different. However, determining this {{in the absence of a}} crystal structure can be challenging. Pulsed field gradient (PFG) NMR has been used for two decades to characterise large macromolecules in solution, but it is still difficult to determine precise structural information, because of the rotational-averaging experienced in experimental measurements. Here, we develop experimental techniques for collecting PFG-NMR data that break this barrier, and allow characterisation of several useful molecular descriptors. By measuring the diffusion coefficients of molecules in a range of solvents, incurvate surfaces are probed to map the outer surface of nanometre-sized molecular species. This technique allows details about the geometrical <b>shape</b> <b>of</b> covalent <b>cages</b> to be determined without the need for isolation. Furthermore, we compare experimental PFG-NMR data to structures produced by computational modelling and produce a new molecular descriptor, ρr, which describes the isotropy <b>of</b> covalent <b>cages.</b> This descriptor is used to determine the quality of agreement between proposed structures and experimental PFG-NMR data. In analysing polymers, we develop a new mathematical model for determining the molar-mass dispersity (ÐM) by PFG-NMR. We find a single parameter is sufficient to determine the dispersity of a system, which eliminates the need for data modelling and enhances the reliability of analysis. We hope this will make the technique more accessible to polymer scientists, and will help test the validity of molar-mass dispersity measurements made by other means. Finally, we synthesise five novel dodecaamide cages, which contain functional groups that offer the opportunity to extend functionality beyond the cage via further reaction. We take significant steps towards producing singly functionalised species, which could be incorporated into polymeric materials for the development of robust membranes and coatings...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{evaluated}} {{the efficiency of}} a curved polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cage in comparison with a wedge PEEK cage according to radiologic and clinical outcomes in patients with cervical degenerative disease. Methods: A total of 37 patients who suffering from cervical disc disease with radiculopathy or myelopathy were reviewed retrospectively. Seventeen patients were underwent anterior cervical discectomy and interbody fusion with a curved shape PEEK cage (curved cage group), and twenty patients with wedge shape PEEK cage (wedge cage group). Clinical assessment was graded using Odom’s criteria, NDI score and VAS score. For radiologic analysis, disc height (DH), segmental angle (SA), subsidence were measured at the preoperative and last follow up. Results: A comparison of the preoperative and postoperative results revealed improvements after the surgery in the DH and SA in both cage groups. The change of postoperative DH between the preoperative and the last follow-up in wedge cage group and curved cage group was 6. 85 % and 25. 5 %, respectively.
