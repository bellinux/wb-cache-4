Instead of treating all data as a byte stream TLTCP allows the application to associate data with deadlines. TLTCP sends data in a similar fashion to TCP until the deadline for a section of data has elapsed; at which point the now obsolete data is discarded in favor of new data.

40|$|The typical {{duration}} of multimedia streams makes wireless network interface (WNIC) energy consumption a particularly acute problem for mobile clients. In this work, we explore ways to transmit data packets in a predictable fashion; allowing the clients to transition the WNIC {{to a lower}} power consuming sleep state. First, we show the limitations of IEEE 802. 11 power saving mode for isochronous multimedia streams. Without {{an understanding of the}} stream requirements, they do not offer any energy savings for multimedia streams over 56 kbps. The potential energy savings is also affected by multiple clients sharing the same access point. On the other hand, an application-specific server side traffic shaping mechanism can offer good energy saving for all the stream formats without any data loss. We show that the mechanism can save up to 83 % of the energy required for receiving data. The technique offers similar savings for multiple clients sharing the same wireless access point. For high fidelity <b>streams,</b> <b>media</b> <b>players</b> react to these added delays by lowering the stream fidelity.

40|$|Abstract Nowadays mobile {{streaming}} service through {{cell phone}} {{is becoming the}} highlight of new value-added mobile services. Based on the present CDMA 1 x wireless data network and Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless (BREW) platform, adopting compression technologies of H. 264 and QCP, a set of <b>streaming</b> <b>media</b> <b>players</b> are designed and implemented, and the principle, structure, key technologies and performance analysis of this system are introduced. This player works well in practice. Key Words streaming media; Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless (BREW); Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP); Real-time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) There are two major methods for audio/video files transfer through the network, downloading and streaming. The volume of storage and network bandwidth restricts transferring big audio/video files. Downloading needs minutes or hours while streaming only takes several seconds in starting and buffering. Streaming server will continuously send real-time packets to clients and the users don’t need {{to wait for the}} whole file to be downloaded. They can play and receive simultaneously without big cache. Streaming is certainly a better choice for the limited working space of cell phone and PDA, etc [1 - 2]. The expanded bandwidth for air interfaces has made a solid ground for <b>streaming</b> <b>media</b> application on wireless networks. With the advantages of wireless system in time and place, mobile <b>streaming</b> <b>media</b> service is very attractive. The China Unicom’s CDMA 1 x data network has an average steady rate of 70 - 80 kbps and is capable of running <b>streaming</b> <b>media</b> business.

40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Electronics and Communication Engineering, İzmir, 2008 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 85 - 88) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxi, 90 leavesThere {{has been}} a surge {{in the number of}} digital audio and video content in recent years. Advances in the compression and storage technologies and improvements in the speed of internet connection have enabled widespread use of multimedia content. A wide variety of devices have been introduced to decode and play these media contents. Initially designed as a mere voice communication device, the mobile phones nowadays come equipped with a variety of multimedia capabilities including media players despite their limited system resources. Nowadays, huge servers host dramatically increased audio and video contents Users prefer to watch these contents while streaming rather than downloading them first. So, streaming media players are responsible to present multimedia contents without annoying interrupts. This thesis firstly introduces challenges in design and implementation of a <b>streaming</b> <b>media</b> <b>player</b> and then proposes solutions. Main challenges are keeping audio-video synchronization and server-client synchronization and detecting stream type, handling of multithreaded operations and buffer management. Audio-video synchronization problem is solved by using audio as master stream. Server-client synchronization problem is solved by designing a playback mechanism that keeps synchronization with the server by tuning the playback rate of a streaming media without losing lip-sync between audio and video. The proposed streaming player also has a feature of identifying the type of a media stream very rapidly without using a discrete stream inspector module. The presented design is heavily multithreaded which is implemented on Linux platform, moreover it is also convenient for and implementable on any multithreaded platform...|$|E
40|$|There is {{widespread}} use of compression in multimedia content delivery, e. g. within video on demand services and transport links between live events and production sites. The content must undergo compression prior to transmission in order to deliver high quality video and audio over most networks, {{this is especially true}} for high definition video content. 	 JPEG 2000 is a recent image compression standard and a suitable compression algorithm for high definition, high rate video. With its highly flexible embedded lossless and lossy compression scheme, JPEG 2000 has a number of advantages over existing video codecs. The only evident drawbacks with respect to real-time applications, are that the computational complexity is quite high and that JPEG 2000, being an image compression codec as opposed to video codec, typically has higher bandwidth requirements. Special-purpose hardware can deliver high performance, but is expensive and not easily updated. A JPEG 2000 decoder application running on general-purpose computer hardware can complement solutions depending on special-purpose hardware and will experience performance scaling together with the available processing power. In addition, production costs will be none-existing, once developed. The application implemented in this project is a <b>streaming</b> <b>media</b> <b>player.</b> It receives a compressed video stream through an IP interface, decodes it frame by frame and presents the decoded frames in a window. The decoder is designed to better take advantage of the processing power available in today's desktop computers. Specifically, decoding is performed on both CPU and GPU in order to decode minimum 50 frames per second of a 720 p JPEG 2000 video stream. The CPU executed part of the decoder application is written in C++, based on the Kakadu SDK and involve all decoding steps up to and including reverse wavelet transform. The GPU executed part of the decoder is enabled by the CUDA programming language, and include luma upsampling and irreversible color transform. Results indicate that general purpose computer hardware today easily can decode JPEG 2000 video at bit rates up to 45 Mbit/s. However, when the video stream is received at 50 fps through the IP interface, packet loss at the socket level limits the attained frame rate to about 45 fps at rates of 40 Mbit/s or lower. If this packet loss could be eliminated, real-time decoding would be obtained up to 40 Mbit/s. At rates above 40 Mbit/s, the attained frame rate is limited by the decoder performance and not the packet loss. Higher codestream rates should be endurable if reverse wavelet transform could be mapped from the CPU to the GPU, since the current pipeline is highly unbalanced. </p...|$|E
