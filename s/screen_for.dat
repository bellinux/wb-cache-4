40|$|Abstract Background Intimate partner {{violence}} (IPV) is a {{human rights}} violation that is pervasive worldwide, and is particularly critical for women during the reproductive period. IPV includes physical, sexual and emotional abuse. Nurses on in-patient postpartum units are well-positioned to <b>screen</b> women <b>for</b> IPV, yet low screening rates suggest that barriers to screening exist. The {{purpose of this study}} was to (a) identify the frequency of <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> IPV, (b) the most important barriers to screening, (c) the relationship between the barriers to screening and the frequency of <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> types of abuse, and (d) to identify other factors that contribute to the frequency of <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> IPV. Methods In 2008, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 96 nurses from postpartum inpatient units in three Canadian urban hospitals. The survey included the Barriers to Abuse Assessment Tool (BAAT), adapted for postpartum nurses (PPN). Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models were used to predict barriers to <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> each type of IPV. Results The frequency of screening varied by the type of abuse with highest <b>screening</b> rates found <b>for</b> physical and emotional abuse. According to the BAAT-PPN, lack of knowledge was the most important barrier to screening. The BAAT-PPN total score was negatively correlated with <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. Using OLS regression models and after controlling for demographic characteristics, the BAAT-PPN explained 14 %, 12 %, and 11 % of the variance in <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> physical, sexual and emotional abuse, respectively. Fluency in the language of the patient was negatively correlated with <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> each type of abuse. When added as Step 3 to OLS regression models, language fluency was associated with an additional decrease in the likelihood of <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> physical (beta coefficient = -. 38, P P =. 05), and emotional abuse (beta coefficient = -. 48, P Conclusions Our findings support an inverse relationship between rates of <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> IPV and nurses' perceptions of barriers. Barriers to <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> IPV, particularly related to knowledge and language fluency, need to be addressed to increase rates of screening on postpartum units. </p...|$|R

40|$|Screening aims {{to improve}} health by early {{detection}} of disease or risk factors for disease. It may also influence health behaviour, either by intention or as a side effect. The aim of this review was to summarize evidence {{of the effects of}} screening, either risk factor <b>screening</b> or <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> {{early detection of}} disease, on health behaviour: smoking habits, diet, exercise, alcohol consumption and adherence to guidelines for healthy living. This review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of screening on health behaviour in a screened group and an unscreened group. Systematic searches of Medline, CCTR and Embase between 1970 and May 2008 were conducted. Seven trials were included, five on <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> risk factors (four cardiovascular; one ALDH 2) and two on <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> early detection of disease (colorectal cancer and hearing loss). In trials of <b>screening</b> <b>for</b> risk factors, health behaviour was on average significantly more favourable in screened individuals.

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{transcriptional}} regulation of EFS, but several transcriptional regulators for EFS have been proposed based on consensus binding sites in its promoter region for ATF (Activating transcription factor), NF-κβ, NF-κβ1, GATA-3, C/EBPα (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha), glucocorticoid receptors α and β, and p53. Expression of isoforms 1 and 2 has been detected in multiple tissues, with maximal expression in the placenta, and the embryonal central nervous system, heart, testes and lungs.
