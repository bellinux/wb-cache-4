Using temperature-sensitive radiotelemetry, we recorded body temperatures of foxsnakes during 12 cold-water swims, and subsequent warming on shore. During these swims, water temperatures were from 11 to 22 degrees C and distances of 85 - 1330 m were travelled. Snakes that were <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> long enough equilibrated with water temperature {{and did not}} maintain a body temperature above ambient. The largest observed drop in body temperature was 22. 6 degrees C (over 11 min) and the largest increase was 23 degrees C (over 66 min). Such large, rapid temperature fluctuations have not previously been reported in detail from snakes in the field. Twice as many telemetry observations as expected occurred between 1200 and 1400, suggesting that snakes chose to swim midday. Additionally, our results suggest that foxsnakes bask to raise their body temperature prior to <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water.</b> We compared <b>swimming</b> speed and the coefficient of temperature change among foxsnakes and other snake species.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of physical performance resulting from dehydration {{has been established}} for centuries.

These changes progressively grow as dehydration worsens. The magnitude of decrements is higher when physical activity is performed in the heat compared to cooler conditions. More than 75 % of the energy generated by skeletal muscle substrate oxidation is liberated as heat.

50|$|Severe {{reactions}} can be {{seen with}} exposure to <b>cold</b> water; <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> {{is the most common}} cause of a severe reaction. This can cause a massive discharge of histamine, resulting in low blood pressure, fainting, shock and even loss of life. Cold urticaria is diagnosed by dabbing an ice cube against the skin of the forearm for 1 to 5 minutes. A distinct hive should develop if a patient suffers cold urticaria. This is different from the normal redness that {{can be seen}} <b>in</b> people without <b>cold</b> urticaria. Patients with cold urticaria need to learn to protect themselves from a hasty drop in body temperature. Regular antihistamines are not generally efficacious. One particular antihistamine, cyproheptadine (Periactin), has been found to be useful. The tricyclic antidepressant doxepin has also been found to be an effective blocking agent of histamine discharge. Finally, a medication named ketotifen, which keeps mast cells from discharging histamine, has also been employed with widespread success.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Winter {{swimming}} {{represents an}} intensive short-term exposure to cold, {{and thus it}} is considered a strong physical stress. Cold-based treatments, i. e. immersions <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water,</b> are spreading <b>in</b> sport medicine for improving recovery following muscle traumas, although a universal acceptance of that method is not still achieved. Materials and methods: Fifteen healthy subjects (13 males and 2 females) were recruited among the participants to a 150 meters long <b>swimming</b> race <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> (6 °C). Blood samples were collec-ted {{the day before and}} immediately after the race and a panel of haematological parameters was eva-luated. Results: <b>Swimming</b> <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> induced a significant variation in the blood cell fraction composition compared to the rest condition, as measured the day before the competition. Red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets count increased significantly (4. 7 %, P = 0. 005; 40. 6 %, P < 0. 001 and 25. 0 %, P < 0. 001, respectively). While the relative number of leukocytes did not change significantly, apart from a strong decrease of the eosinophils population (- 48. 6 %; P < 0. 001), a strong increase in the total number of neutrophil granulocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes was recorded (42. 6 %, P = 0. 002, 58. 2 %, P = 0. 001 and 27. 5 %, P = 0. 021, respectively). Following normalization on plasma vo-lume change (- 2. 54 %) the results were unchanged, demonstrating that the variations were not due to a mere haemoconcentration.

40|$|Swimming is {{the most}} popular {{participation}} sport in the UK with open water swimming seeing a rise in popularity over the last decade. However, <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> immersion is not without significant risks. Drowning represents the third leading cause of accidental death worldwide and in those aged 1 to 14 years it represents the leading cause of accidental death in some countries. Given the physical, physiological and psychological differences between adults and children, the latter are considered particularly at risk of cold-related illness and hypothermia. The 'cold shock' response on initial immersion, and the insidious onset of hypothermia and swim failure that accompanies prolonged exposure and swimming, are recognised to be potentially fatal. This has been well documented in adults, and whilst it is assumed that similar responses occur in children there is little quantitative evidence of this to date. Furthermore, adults show an habituation of their 'cold shock' response and change in their cooling rates following repeated exposure to <b>cold</b> <b>water,</b> however there are no data that show similar changes in children. This study examined the physiological and subjective responses of children to <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> on initial immersion and on prolonged immersion whilst swimming, and assessed for any adaptation in these responses following a year of repeated <b>swim</b> training <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water.</b> It was hypothesised that: children would demonstrate a 'cold shock' response on initial immersion that would habituate following a period of acclimatisation; children would demonstrate faster cooling rates than those seen <b>in</b> adults whilst <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water,</b> and their rate of cooling would adapt over a year of <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> swim training. METHOD 17 children aged 10 and 11 years old were recruited from applicants to the Bristol English Channel Swim Team (an attempt by a group of children to be the youngest relay team to swim the Channel). They underwent a five-minute static immersion in 15 QC water, during which their cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic responses were recorded. Ten of these participants went on to swim for up to 40 minutes in 15 QC water, during which their heart rates, gastrointestinal temperatures and oxygen consumption were measured. The gastrointestinal temperatures of participants during the re- warming phase (post immersion) was also monitored and recorded. Subjective thermal sensation and comfort were recorded prior to immersion, after five minutes static immersion, {{and at the end of}} the swims. Following a year of regular <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> swim training, eight participants returned to complete the five-minute static immersion and five of the original ten swimmers completed a swim of up to 40 minutes in 15 QC water. This allowed us to identify any evidence of adaptation in their 1 initial responses to immersion <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> and cooling rates whilst swimming. The data gathered were compared to adult data collected in the same laboratory during a different experiment. RESULTS An increase in heart rate, respiratory frequency and inspiratory volume was seen in all participants in the first few minutes of immersion. However, responses were found to be smaller in children compared to adul~s (P < 0. 05), and no significant attenuation was seen in these after a year of regular exposure to <b>cold</b> <b>water.</b> Children did however feel warmer (P < 0. 01) and more comfortable (P < 0. 05) following five minutes of static immersion after a year of <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> swim training. There was great variability in the rate of cooling between children, likely due to differences in their anthropometric profiles. Sum of skinfolds was found to hold the greatest correlation with rate of deep body cooling (R 2 = 0. 4157). The mean (SD) cooling rate of the children whilst swimming was 2. 5 (3. 06) °C. h- 1. No statistical difference was found in the cooling rates of five children following a year of <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> swim training. No difference was found between children and adults in their cooling rates whilst swimming, however the trend in both groups of a slower rate of cooling following acclimatisation became significant (P = 0. 026) once the child and adult data were pooled. DISCUSSION This study provides evidence that the 'cold shock' response exists III children, but is possibly smaller than that seen in adults. The lack of attenuation in this response following acclimatisation is a surprising finding that warrants further investigation, although it may be that the children were pre-acclimatised prior to their initial immersion, or due to a small sample size. This study provides quantitative data on cooling rates of children <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water.</b> It finds that children maintain their deep body temperature as effectively as adults, which is likely partly explained by a greater percentage body fat (P < 0. 05) and higher relative heat production, as measured by oxygen consumption (P < 0. 05), seen in the children. The data support an habituation of children's subjective thermal awareness and goes some way to suggest that children aged 11 - 12 years old exhibit an insulative adaptation following regular <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water.</b> It is hoped that this study provides a better understanding of children's physiological responses to accidental and non- accidental immersion, and will aid risk assessments in any projects involving paediatric immersion <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Acute diffuse {{otitis externa}} (swimmer's ear), otomycosis, exostoses, {{traumatic}} eardrum perforation, middle ear infection, and barotraumas {{of the inner}} ear are common problems in swimmers and people engaged in aqua activities. The most common ear problem in swimmers is acute diffuse otitis externa, with Pseudomonas aeruginosa being the most common pathogen. The symptoms are itching, otalgia, otorrhea, and conductive hearing loss. The treatment includes frequent cleansing of the ear canal, pain control, oral or topical medications, acidification of the ear canal, and control of predisposing factors. <b>Swimming</b> <b>in</b> polluted waters and ear-canal cleaning with cotton-tip applicators should be avoided. Exostoses are usually seen <b>in</b> people who <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> and present with symptoms of accumulated debris, otorrhea and conductive hearing loss.

We have assessed {{the relative importance of}} physiological and behavioral adjustments in aquatic endotherms by studying the case of the poorly insulated great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) in two contrasting thermal environments: Normandy (water temperature 12 °C) and Greenland (water temperature 5 °C). Major differences were found in the feeding behavior of birds breeding in the two regions. Greenland birds showed a 70 % reduction <b>in</b> time spent <b>swimming</b> relative to those in Normandy. Reduction in Greenland was achieved first by reducing time spent on the surface between dives and secondly by returning to land in between intensive bouts of diving.

Our study shows that <b>in</b> a <b>cold</b> foraging environment, poorly insulated great cormorants significantly increase their foraging efficiency. To do this they rely on ecological adaptive patterns (minimization of time spent <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> and increased prey capture rates) far more than physiological adaptations (minimizing instantaneous costs).

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effects of <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> swim stress (CWSS) on the volumetric parameters of rat adrenal gland. Materials and Method: In this experimental study, 20 mature male Sprague Dawley rats, weighing 200 ± 30 g were selected and randomly divided into two equal study and control groups (n= 10). Stress was induced by forced <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> (15 °C), 2 min daily for 20 days. The animals were weighed and decapitated. Their adrenal glands were excised quickly, freed of fat tissue, weighed, and fixed in Lilli’s solution and embedded in paraplast, according to routine histological procedures. Five µm sections were cut using microtome and stained by the Masson trichrome technique. Volumetric parameters of adrenal gland and its components were estimated using point counting method. The Mann Whitney-U test was employed to determine statistically significant differences between the means. Results: Results showed that <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> swim stress induced a significant reduction in body weight (p< 0. 01), and a significant increase in relative adrenal weight (p< 0. 001).

40|$|PhDWhen {{the head}} was cooled for 30 minutes, sublingual {{temperature}} fell {{by as much as}} 4. 45 Â°C below oesophageal which remained steady. Insulation of the head prevented this local cooling. There was an increased flow of cold parotid saliva when {{the head was}} exposed to cold and this appeared to be the major factor which depressed sublingual temperature. The estimation of deep body temperature from sublingual readings is meaningful only if precautions are taken to prevent local cooling of the head. Local cooling has been shown to depress temperature measured from the external auditory canal. A portable device (The Zero Gradient Aural Thermometer) was developed and used to measure external auditory canal temperature keeping the outer ear, monitored by a second thermistor, at the same level as the canal by servo-controlled heating. Measured in this way, aural temperature was always within 0. 35 Â°C of oesophageal under a variety of thermal stress. Rates of fall of deep body temperature <b>in</b> 28 children <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> correlated highly with overall subcutaneous fat thickness and a higher' correlation was obtained when allowance was made for differences in surface area/mass ratios.

Differences in fat distribution had a small effect on cooling rates.

Unfortunately, Rikli wasn't very popular among the local people; he was considering them rustic, and locals considered Rikli to have odd practices. This may have followed from public nakedness in his park, the fact that he never learned the Slovenian language (despite living there for 52 years), and that he never accepted local customs.

The study consists of 4 groups (i) control, (ii) 1 day cold stress, (iii) 7 days cold stress and (iv) 14 days cold stress. The cold stress procedure was done by allowing the animal to <b>swim</b> <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> at 14 °C for 5 minutes every day. After the stress period, the neurobehavioral parameters were studied by using open field behavior and elevated plus maze. Results: There was a significant decrease in ambulation, rearing, grooming with a significant (P< 0. 001) increase in immobilization time of 1 day cold stress exposed group and 7 th day cold stress exposed group in open field behavior model, whereas the 14 th day stress group showed a significant decrease in ambulation only. In elevated plus maze, time spent in open arm was significantly decreased in 1 st and 7 th day stress group (P< 0. 001) and the number of entries in open arms and closed arms was significantly decreased in all stress exposed groups when compared with their respective control groups. Conclusion: Cold stress can affect hypothalamic- pituitary adrenal axis and thereby increase anxiety resulting in change in behavior and locomotor activity. When the stress period was prolonged to 7 - 14 days, there was a gradual recovery back to near normal. This type of behavior of the animals to prolonged stress could be attributed to habituation of the hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal axis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Objective: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the effects of acupuncturing Pishu combined with Gin-senoside Rg 3 on the immune function of rats with chronic fatigue. Methods: Forty male SD rats were equally ran-domized into control group, chronic fatigue system group (CFS), Ginsenoside Rg 3 (Rg 3) group, acupuncture group and acupuncture combined with Ginsenoside Rg 3 (A+Rg 3) group. Rats with chronic fatigue were established by bounding and forced <b>swimming</b> <b>in</b> <b>cold</b> <b>water</b> once daily for 21 days except control group, then the rats in the acupuncture and A+Rg 3 group were treated by manual acupuncture stimulation of bilateral “Pishu ” once daily for 7 days. Ginsenoside Rg 3 was administered by intravenous to the rats of the A+Rg 3 and Rg 3 group for 7 days in dosages of 2 mg/kg body weight, and two markers of physical fatigue were evaluated: body weight and blood lactic acid (LA). The percentages of CD 3 + lymphocytes, CD 4 + lymphocytes, and CD 8 + lymphocytes in the spleens of the rats were evaluated using flow cytometric analysis. Serum IFN-gamma (IFN-γ) and IL- 4 contents were detected by ELISA. Results: Increased body weight and reduced blood LA concentrations were found in the rat of Rg 3 group and A+Rg 3 group than that in CFS group. The rat of Rg 3 group and A+Rg 3 group also showed {{a significant increase in the}} percentage of CD 4 + lymphocytes and a significant decrease in the percentage of CD 8 + lymphocytes and correct CD 4 +/CD 8 + ratio. Compared with the CFS group, the level of IFN-γ in the Rg 3, acupuncture and A+Rg 3 groups was reduced and IL- 4 was increased. Conclusions: Acupuncture and Rg 3 can improve the immune system activity of CFS rats and acupuncturing Pishu combined with Rg 3 was significantly superior compared with Rg 3 and acupuncture, respectively...|$|R
