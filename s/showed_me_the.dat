25|$|I owe {{a lot to}} R. B. Woodward. He {{showed me}} that one could attack {{difficult}} problems without {{a clear idea of}} their outcome, but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them. He <b>showed</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning. He showed me that one does not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to the deduction of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science. I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist.|$|E
