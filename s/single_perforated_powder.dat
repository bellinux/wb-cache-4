60|$|Many {{years ago}} I was struck {{with the fact}} that humble-bees as a general rule {{perforate}} flowers only when these grow in large numbers near together. In a garden where there were some very large beds of Stachys coccinea and of Pentstemon argutus, every <b>single</b> flower was <b>perforated,</b> but I found two plants of the former species growing quite separate with their petals much scratched, showing that they had been frequently visited by bees, and yet not a <b>single</b> flower was <b>perforated.</b> I found also a separate plant of the Pentstemon, and saw bees entering the mouth of the corolla, and not a single flower had been perforated. In the following year (1842) I visited the same garden several times: on the 19th of July humble-bees were sucking the flowers of Stachys coccinea and Salvia grahami in the proper manner, and none of the corollas were perforated. On the 7th of August all the flowers were perforated, even those on some few plants of the Salvia which grew at a little distance from the great bed. On the 21st of August only a few flowers on the summits of the spikes of both species remained fresh, and not one of these was now bored. Again, in my own garden every plant in several rows of the common bean had many flowers perforated; but I found three plants in separate parts of the garden which had sprung up accidentally, and these had not a <b>single</b> flower <b>perforated.</b> General Strachey formerly saw many perforated flowers in a garden in the Himalaya, and he wrote to the owner to inquire whether this relation between the plants growing crowded and their perforation by the bees there held good, and was answered in the affirmative. Hence it follows that the red clover (Trifolium pratense) and the common bean when cultivated in great masses in fields,--that Erica tetralix growing in large numbers on heaths,--rows of the scarlet kidney-bean in the kitchen-garden,--and masses of any species in the flower-garden,--are all eminently liable to be perforated.|$|R

Mach number is the parameter to reflect the compressibility of steam flow. Higher Mach number may cause serious aerodynamic noise of steams flow, waste {{large amount of energy}} and do harm to the valves and pipelines. In this paper, Mach number on multi-stage perforated plates inside a novel HPRV and the linked pipelines is investigated. Mach number in reversible isentropic process is analyzed and the design method of multi-stage perforated plates in HPRV is proposed. Then, the RNG k-ϵ model combining with compressible gas is established, and the Mach number simulation of <b>single</b> <b>perforated</b> plate and multi-stage perforated plates is carried out in software Fluent 6. 3.

Furthermore, there exists a limited pressure ratio of every stage perforated plate, and it is better to keep the pressure ratio of every stage perforated plate larger than 0. 5.

30|$|Curative {{treatment}} involved marginal or wide resection, {{dead space}} management, provision of bony stability, soft tissue reconstruction, and/or skeletal reconstruction, {{in conjunction with}} pathogen-directed adjuvant antibiotics {{for a period of}} 6  weeks. In cases without skeletal instability (Cierny and Mader anatomical type I, II and III lesions), the aim was to maintain stability by marginal debridement through direct unroofing (tangential excision with high-speed burr) and/or indirect unroofing (medullary reaming). In cases involving skeletal instability, wide (segmental) resection was performed and stability provided by circular external fixation. Dead space management techniques were tailored to the anatomical nature of the pathology. A modified version of continuous irrigation, as proposed by Lautenbach, was used in type I (medullary) post-operative infections [15, 16]. A solution of 80  mg of gentamicin in 1000  ml 0.9  % NaCl was infused at 125  ml/h through a <b>single</b> <b>perforated</b> 6 -mm drain tube that was placed intramedullary through the nail entry site and a distal cortical window {{at the site of the}} previous locking screws.

Emphasis was placed on soft tissue reconstruction with the closure of soft tissue defects with well-perfused healthy tissue. Where direct primary closure was deemed unfeasible, a plastic surgeon performed closure with a tissue flap with preference given to muscular flaps. Post-operatively, all patients were treated with generic parenteral antibiotics in the form of cefazolin and imipenem until the 7 -day microscopy, culture, and sensitivity (MCS) results became available.

40|$|Lithium-ion {{batteries}} are increasingly becoming an ubiquitous {{part of our}} everyday life - they are present in mobile phones, laptops, tools, cars, etc. However, {{there are still many}} concerns about their longevity and their safety. In this work we focus on the simulation of several degradation mechanisms on the microscopic scale, where one can resolve the active materials inside the electrodes of the lithium-ion batteries as porous structures. We mainly study two aspects - heat generation and mechanical stress. For the former we consider an electrochemical non-isothermal model on the spatially resolved porous scale to observe the temperature increase inside a battery cell, as well as to observe the individual heat sources to assess their contributions to the total heat generation. As a result from our experiments, we determined that the temperature has very small spatial variance for our test cases and thus allows for an ODE formulation of the heat equation. The second aspect that we consider is the generation of mechanical stress {{as a result of the}} insertion of lithium ions in the electrode materials. We study two approaches - using small strain models and finite strain models. For the small strain models, the initial geometry and the current geometry coincide. The model considers a diffusion equation for the lithium ions and equilibrium equation for the mechanical stress. First, we test a <b>single</b> <b>perforated</b> cylindrical particle using different boundary conditions for the displacement and with Neumann boundary conditions for the diffusion equation. We also test for cylindrical particles, but with boundary conditions for the diffusion equation in the electrodes coming from an isothermal electrochemical model for the whole battery cell. For the finite strain models we take in consideration the deformation of the initial geometry as a result of the intercalation and the mechanical stress. We compare two elastic models to study the sensitivity of the predicted elastic behavior on the specific model used. We also consider a softening of the active material dependent on the concentration of the lithium ions and using data for silicon electrodes. We recover the general behavior of the stress from known physical experiments. Some models, like the mechanical models we use, depend on the local values of the concentration to predict the mechanical stress. In that sense we perform a short comparative study between the Finite Element Method with tetrahedral elements and the Finite Volume Method with voxel volumes for an isothermal electrochemical model. The spatial discretizations of the PDEs are done using the Finite Element Method. For some models we have discontinuous quantities where we adapt the FEM accordingly. The time derivatives are discretized using the implicit Backward Euler method. The nonlinear systems are linearized using the Newton method. All of the discretized models are implemented in a C++ framework developed during the thesis...|$|R
