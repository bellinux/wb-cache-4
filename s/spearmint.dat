5|$|On 14 November 1951, {{locomotive}} 60100 <b>Spearmint</b> {{ran away}} on the 1 in 44 Cowlairs incline approaching Glasgow Queen Street Station. A defective repair on a vacuum pipe had left engine without brakes. The engine, which was scheduled to work the afternoon departure to Leeds, collided with the stock for the same train which was being shunted across the station, the dining-car crew were injured in the collision.|$|E
5|$|Species {{boundaries}} in plants may be weaker than in animals, and cross species hybrids are often possible. A familiar example is peppermint, Mentha × piperita, a sterile hybrid between Mentha aquatica and <b>spearmint,</b> Mentha spicata. The many cultivated varieties of wheat {{are the result}} of multiple inter- and intra-specific crosses between wild species and their hybrids. Angiosperms with monoecious flowers often have self-incompatibility mechanisms that operate between the pollen and stigma so that the pollen either fails to reach the stigma or fails to germinate and produce male gametes. This is one of several methods used by plants to promote outcrossing. In many land plants the male and female gametes are produced by separate individuals. These species are said to be dioecious when referring to vascular plant sporophytes and dioicous when referring to bryophyte gametophytes.|$|E

25|$|Carvone is {{a member}} of a family of {{chemicals}} called terpenoids. Carvone is found naturally in many essential oils, but is most abundant in the oils from seeds of caraway (Carum carvi), <b>spearmint</b> (Mentha spicata), and dill.|$|E
25|$|Tea easily retains odors, {{which can}} cause {{problems}} in processing, transportation, and storage. This same sensitivity also allows for special processing (such as tea infused with smoke during drying) and {{a wide range of}} scented and flavoured variants, such as bergamot (found in Earl Grey), vanilla, and <b>spearmint.</b>|$|E
25|$|The bleached-blond {{hair that}} became a band {{trademark}} happened by accident. In February 1978, the band, desperate for money, was asked to do a commercial for Wrigley's <b>Spearmint</b> chewing gum (directed by Tony Scott) on the condition they dye their hair blond. The commercial was shot with the band, but was shelved and never aired.|$|E
25|$|Creamy snuffs are tobacco paste, {{consisting}} of tobacco, clove oil, glycerin, <b>spearmint,</b> menthol, and camphor, {{and sold in}} a toothpaste tube. It is marketed mainly to women in India, and is known by the brand names Ipco (made by Asha Industries), Denobac, Tona, and Ganesh. It is locally known as mishri {{in some parts of}} Maharashtra.|$|E
25|$|Toothpaste {{comes in}} a variety of colors, and flavors {{intended}} to encourage use of the product. Three most common flavorants are peppermint, <b>spearmint,</b> and wintergreen. Toothpaste flavored with peppermint-anise oil is popular in the Mediterranean region. These flavors are provided by the respective oils, e.g. peppermint oil. More exotic flavors include Anethole anise, apricot, bubblegum, cinnamon, fennel, lavender, neem, ginger, vanilla, lemon, orange, and pine. Alternatively, unflavored toothpastes exist.|$|E
25|$|Amortentia {{is a love}} potion {{that does}} not create actual love, but gives the drinker a {{powerful}} obsession and infatuation with the giver of the potion. It is usually either forced upon someone or covertly given. As {{a rule of thumb}} the longer a love potion awaits consumption, the stronger the effects will be, as seen in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince when Ron Weasley mistakenly eats a box of Chocolate Cauldrons spiked with the intense love potion intended for Harry previously bought from Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. The potion's aroma is unique to each person who consumes it, as it smells like whatever attracts each individual, e.g. Hermione Granger says that she smells <b>spearmint</b> toothpaste, freshly cut grass and a piece of fresh parchment in the movies. In the books, she does not say <b>spearmint</b> toothpaste as the third aroma but instead blushes. (she smelled Ron's hair according to later clarification by the author). It can also be identified by its characteristic spirals of steam and its mother-of-pearl sheen, as noted by Hermione. Unless constantly administered, its effects eventually wear off.|$|E
25|$|Carvone forms two {{mirror image}} forms or enantiomers: R-(–)-carvone smells like <b>spearmint</b> leaves. Its mirror image, S-(+)-carvone, smells like caraway seeds. The {{fact that the}} two enantiomers are {{perceived}} as smelling different is evidence that olfactory receptors must contain chiral groups, allowing them to respond more strongly to one enantiomer than to the other. Not all enantiomers have distinguishable odors. Squirrel monkeys have also {{been found to be}} able to discriminate between carvone enantiomers.|$|E
25|$|Washington is {{a leading}} lumber {{producer}}. Its rugged surface is rich in stands of Douglas fir, hemlock, ponderosa pine, white pine, spruce, larch, and cedar. The state is the biggest producer of apples, hops, pears, red raspberries, <b>spearmint</b> oil, and sweet cherries, and ranks high {{in the production of}} apricots, asparagus, dry edible peas, grapes, lentils, peppermint oil, and potatoes. Livestock and livestock products make important contributions to total farm revenue, and the commercial fishing of salmon, halibut, and bottomfish makes a significant contribution to the state's economy.|$|E

He followed a vegan diet for a year but switched to a Paleo diet {{due to lack of}} energy. He suffers from low testosterone and underwent testosterone replacement therapy from 2012 until its banning in 2014. Mir worked as a bouncer at the <b>Spearmint</b> Rhino in Las Vegas before entering the UFC and continued to work there as Director of Security while pursuing his UFC career. In January 2016, it was announced that Mir would be inducted into the Southern Nevada Sports Hall of Fame.|$|E
25|$|Sir Francis Bacon {{published}} one of {{the first}} plant physiology experiments in 1627 in the book, Sylva Sylvarum. Bacon grew several terrestrial plants, including a rose, in water and concluded that soil was only needed to keep the plant upright. Jan Baptist van Helmont published what is considered the first quantitative experiment in plant physiology in 1648. He grew a willow tree for five years in a pot containing 200 pounds of oven-dry soil. The soil lost just two ounces of dry weight and van Helmont concluded that plants get all their weight from water, not soil. In 1699, John Woodward published experiments on growth of <b>spearmint</b> in different sources of water. He found that plants grew much better in water with soil added than in distilled water.|$|E
25|$|The Feria de Nieve (Ices and Ice cream Fair) {{takes place}} in Santiago Tulyehualco each April. Flavored snow was {{consumed}} in the pre Hispanic period, eaten by the rich and made from snow from the nearby mountains and transported through this area. The consumption of this flavored snow continued into the colonial era and the first fair dedicated to it was established in 1529 by Martín de Valencia. The fair was celebrated sporadically until 1885 when there was renewed interest in it, making it an annual event. In 2009, the event had its 124th anniversary. During this time, new flavors and types of frozen confections have been invented. Some of the flavors are uncommon, such as rose petal, pulque, mole, <b>spearmint,</b> lettuce, shrimp and tequila. Many of these were developed by local resident Faustino Cicilia Mora.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{chewing gum}} was first {{developed}} in the 1860s when chicle was brought from Mexico by the former President, General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, to New York, where {{he gave it to}} Thomas Adams for use as a rubber substitute. Chicle did not succeed as a replacement for rubber, but as a gum, which was cut into strips and marketed as Adams New York Chewing Gum in 1871. Black Jack (1884), which is flavored with licorice, Chiclets (1899), and Wrigley's <b>Spearmint</b> Gum were early popular gums that quickly dominated the market and are all still around today. Chewing gum gained worldwide popularity through American GIs in WWII, who were supplied chewing gum as a ration and traded it with locals. Synthetic gums were first introduced to the U.S. after chicle no longer satisfied the needs of making good chewing gum. By the 1960s, US manufacturers had switched to butadiene-based synthetic rubber, as it was cheaper to manufacture.|$|E
500|$|Following surgery, Paynter quickly {{started to}} regain his weight, putting on 35 pounds in the two weeks between his surgery and being sent to Fair Hill Training Center's Equine Therapy program on October 15 for rehabilitation. Nonetheless, he arrived at Fair Hill {{weighing}} only 912 pounds. [...] At Fair Hill, he started out with hand-walking and grazing, later being allowed short periods of exercise in a round pen. [...] He had access to treatment in a horse-sized hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber, an underwater treadmill called an AquaPacer, equine massage therapy, electromagnetic therapy, and use of a cold saltwater spa. [...] By November 15, {{he was close to}} 1,000 pounds and was allowed free daily turnout in a paddock. His normal temperament returned as he began to buck and kick during turnout. [...] He also developed a taste for red peppermint candies, strongly preferring them over green <b>spearmint</b> ones.|$|E
500|$|Studies on the non-vascular flora {{recorded}} {{the presence of}} about 150 moss species {{in the area of}} the national park, including one newly described taxon. Many herbs of the Vikos Gorge and other areas within the park were regarded to have medicinal properties and were once harvested by local healers, colloquially referred to as [...] "Vikos doctors" [...] ( [...] , [...] "Vikoiatri"). These herbal healers used special recipes that were often copies of ancient Greek recipes of Hippocrates or Dioscorides and became famous beyond the borders of Greece. The plants used in these recipes include the lemon balm Melissa officinalis, Tilia tomentosa, the <b>spearmint</b> Mentha spicata, the gas-plant Dictamnus albus, St John’s Wort Hypericum perforatum, [...] absinth Artemisia absinthium, the very popular Sideritis raeseri, known colloquially in Greece as “mountain tea”, and the elder bush Sambucus nigra. A chemical screening of these native plant species has shown that a high number of them are characterized by biologically active ingredients. A collection of 2,500 dried species of local plants and herbs is exhibited in the local natural history museum in the village of Koukouli.|$|E

2500|$|S-(+)-Carvone is the {{principal}} constituent (60–70%) of the oil from caraway seeds (Carum carvi), which is produced {{on a scale of}} about 10 tonnes per year. [...] It also occurs to the extent of about 40–60% in dill seed oil (from Anethum graveolens), and also in mandarin orange peel oil. R-(–)-Carvone is also the most abundant compound in the essential oil from several species of mint, particularly <b>spearmint</b> oil (Mentha spicata), which is composed of 50–80% R-(–)-carvone. [...] <b>Spearmint</b> is a major source of naturally produced R-(–)-carvone. [...] However, the majority of R-(–)-carvone used in commercial applications is synthesized from R-(+)-limonene. The R-(–)-carvone isomer also occurs in kuromoji oil. Some oils, like gingergrass oil, contain a mixture of both enantiomers. Many other natural oils, for example peppermint oil, contain trace quantities of carvones.|$|E

2500|$|The exact {{etymology}} of mentula {{is somewhat}} obscure, although outwardly {{it would appear}} to be a diminutive of mēns, gen. mentis, the [...] "mind" [...] (i.e.; [...] "the little mind"). Mentum is the chin. Cicero's letter 9:22 ad Familiares relates it to menta, a <b>spearmint</b> stalk. Tucker's Etymological Dictionary of Latin relates it to ēminēre, [...] "to project outwards", and mōns, [...] "a mountain", all of which suggest an Indo-European *men-.|$|E
2500|$|Advertising also grew {{significantly}} in the 1920s, growing from $25 million to $85 million over the decade. For example, the Wrigley <b>Spearmint</b> Gum sign, possibly the biggest electric sign [...] "in the world," [...] cost $9,000 per month to rent. Some contemporary critics, such as Thorstein Veblen and G.K. Chesterton, disliked the advertising at Times Square. Fritz Lang, after seeing Times Square in 1923, used it as inspiration for his dark industrial film Metropolis.|$|E
2500|$|To {{provide a}} ready supply of raw mint for extraction, Todd {{established}} two gigantic plantations, called [...] "Mentha" [...] in Pine Grove Township and [...] "Campaignia" [...] near Fennville. The latter {{was the largest}} mint plantation {{in the world at}} that time. In all the company would come to itself grow and harvest approximately 10,000 acres annually planted to peppermint, <b>spearmint,</b> and other aromatic herbs. Todd and his company developed scientific methods for testing various qualities of mint distillates which allowed a means of grading the oils and were leaders in developing disease resistant strains following the emergence of the fungal-borne verticillium wilt in 1924.|$|E
2500|$|American-style striptease, closely {{associated}} with contemporary clubs around the world, began to appear outside of North America in the post-World War II era, emerging in Asian performances during the late 1940s and in European theaters by 1950.

[...] In 2003, its London location reportedly made UK£3 per minute. Strip clubs offering American striptease and other adult entertainment services have been established on six of seven continents (all except Antarctica), and the demand for these types of business is soaring in economically developing nations. Most adult entertainment companies, which include strip clubs, are in privately held ownership.|$|E

2500|$|Recently pole dancing {{has come}} to {{dominate}} the world of striptease. In the late 20th century, pole dancing was practised in exotic dance clubs in Canada. These clubs grew up to become a thriving sector of the economy. Canadian style pole dancing, table dancing and lap dancing, organized by multi-national corporations such as <b>Spearmint</b> Rhino, was exported from North America to (among other countries) the United Kingdom, the nations of central Europe, Russia and Australia. In London, England a raft of such so-called [...] "lap dancing clubs" [...] {{grew up in the}} 1990s, featuring pole dancing on stage and private table dancing, though, despite media misrepresentation, lap-dancing in the sense of bodily contact was forbidden by law.|$|E

2500|$|Human F. hepatica {{infection}} {{is determined by}} the presence of the intermediate snail hosts, domestic herbivorous animals, climatic conditions and the dietary habits of man. [...] Sheep, goats and cattle are considered the predominant animal reservoirs. While other animals can be infected, they are usually not very important for human disease transmission. On the other hand, some authors have observed that donkeys and pigs contribute to disease transmission in Bolivia. Among wild animals, it has been demonstrated that the peridomestic rat (Rattus rattus) may {{play an important role in}} the spread as well as in the transmission of the parasite in Corsica. In France, nutria (Myocastor coypus) was confirmed as a wild reservoir host of F. hepatica. [...] Humans are infected by ingestion of aquatic plants that contain the infectious cercariae. Several species of aquatic vegetables are known as a vehicle of human infection. In Europe, Nasturtium officinale (common watercress), Nasturtium silvestris, Rorippa amphibia (wild watercress), Taraxacum dens leonis (dandelion leaves), Valerianella olitoria (lamb's lettuce), and Mentha viridis (<b>spearmint)</b> were reported as a source of human infections. In the Northern Bolivian Altiplano, some authors suggested that several aquatic plants such as bero-bero (watercress), algas (algae), kjosco and tortora could act as a source of infection for humans. Because F. hepatica cercariae also encyst on water surface, humans can be infected by drinking of fresh untreated water containing cercariae. In addition, an experimental study suggested that humans consuming raw liver dishes from fresh livers infected with juvenile flukes could become infected.|$|E
