2500|$|To prevent {{excessively}} {{rapid cycling}} {{of the equipment}} when the temperature is near the set point, a thermostat can include some hysteresis. Instead of changing from [...] "on" [...] to [...] "off" [...] and vice versa instantly at the <b>set</b> <b>temperature,</b> a thermostat with hysteresis will not switch until the temperature has changed a little past the <b>set</b> <b>temperature</b> point. For example, a refrigerator set to 2°C might not start the cooling compressor until its food compartment's temperature reaches 3°C, and will keep it running until the temperature has been lowered to 1 °C. This {{reduces the risk of}} equipment wear from too frequent switching, although it introduces a target system temperature oscillation of a certain magnitude.|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common example of purely {{mechanical}} thermostat technology in use today is {{the internal combustion engine}} cooling system thermostat, used to maintain the engine near its optimum operating temperature by regulating the flow of coolant to an air-cooled radiator. This type of thermostat operates using a sealed chamber containing a wax pellet that melts and expands at a <b>set</b> <b>temperature.</b> The expansion of the chamber operates a rod which opens a valve when the operating temperature is exceeded. The operating temperature is determined by the composition of the wax. [...] Once the operating temperature is reached, the thermostat progressively increases or decreases its opening in response to temperature changes, dynamically balancing the coolant recirculation flow and coolant flow to the radiator to maintain the engine temperature in the optimum range.|$|E

In pyrolysis, we have conducted experimentally about char formation and gas products of woody biomass in slow pyrolysis. In the investigation of char formation, a packed bed of biomass particles undergoing pyrolysis has been two-dimensionally visualized.

2500|$|Thermostats use {{different}} types of sensors to measure the temperature. In one form, the mechanical thermostat, a bimetallic strip {{in the form of}} a coil directly operates electrical contacts that control the heating or cooling source. Electronic thermostats, instead, use a thermistor or other semiconductor sensor that requires amplification and processing to control the heating or cooling equipment (or even both, through the use of relays). A thermostat is an example of a [...] "bang-bang controller" [...] as the heating or cooling equipment output is not proportional to the difference between actual temperature and the temperature setpoint. Instead, the heating or cooling equipment runs at full capacity until the <b>set</b> <b>temperature</b> is reached, then shuts off. Increasing the difference between the thermostat setting and the desired temperature therefore does not change the time to achieve the desired temperature. The rate at which the target system temperature can change is determined both by the capacity of the heating or cooling equipment to respectively add or remove heat to or from a target system and the capacity of the target system to store heat.|$|E

40|$|Study Design. A {{review of}} the {{laboratory}} and clinical data for a new strontium-containing hydroxyapatite bioactive bone cement. Objectives. To compare {{the properties of the}} strontium-containing bioactive bone cement with those of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and hydroxyapatite (HA) bone cements. Summary of Background Data. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty using conventional PMMA bone cements have been effectively used to treat osteoporotic spine fractures with good short- and medium-term results. However, PMMA has some undesirable properties, including its high <b>setting</b> <b>temperature,</b> lack of osseointegration, and large stiffness mismatch with osteoporotic bone. These properties are responsible for some postoperative complications. Methods. Strontium-containing hydroxyapatite (Sr-HA) bioactive bone cement consists of a filler blend of strontium-containing hydroxyapatite, fumed silica and benzoyl peroxide; and a resin blend of bisphenol A diglycidylether methacrylate, triethylene glycol dimethacrylate, poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate, and N, N-dimethyl-p-toluidine. Its properties, including mechanical strength, <b>setting</b> <b>temperature,</b> biocompatibility, and osseoinduction, were compared with other cements in vitro and in vivo. Early clinical results are presented. Results. The Sr-HA cement has a setting time of 15 to 18 minutes, a maximum <b>setting</b> <b>temperature</b> of 58 ° C, a compressive strength of 40. 9 MPa, bending strength of 31. 3 MPa, and a bending modulus of 1, 408 MPa. The bending strength and modulus are closer to human cancellous bone. Sr-HA cement promotes osteoblast attachment and mineralization in vitro and bone growth and osseointegration in vivo. In a pilot study, 23 cases of osteoporotic fractures treated with this cement with a mean follow-up of 18 months suggest that it is as effective as PMMA in relieving pain. Discussions. Oral strontium has been shown to induce new bone formation and is effective in reducing fracture risk in osteoporosis. Our data suggest that strontium delivered locally has the same effect; thus, the combination of strontium with HA in a cement with a low <b>setting</b> <b>temperature,</b> adequate stiffness, and low viscosity makes this a good bioactive cement for vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. © 2005, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|Apart from {{sluggish}} {{performance to}} avoid oscillations, {{another problem with}} proportional-only control is that power application is always {{in direct proportion to}} the error. In the example above we assumed that the <b>set</b> <b>temperature</b> could be maintained with 50% power. What happens if the furnace is required in a different application where a higher <b>set</b> <b>temperature</b> will require 80% power to maintain it? If the gain was finally set to a 50° PB, then 80% power will not be applied unless the furnace is 15° below setpoint, so for this other application the operators will have to remember always to set the setpoint temperature 15° higher than actually needed. This 15° figure is not completely constant either: it will depend on the surrounding ambient temperature, as well as other factors that affect heat loss from or absorption within the furnace.|$|E

In a house, the largest load with a thermal cycle is often the heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. So the thermal dynamics of typical residential electric air conditioner is discussed, and then an equivalent thermal parameters (ETP) model is built by the thermal equilibrium in this paper. Based on this, the switch status, indoor air temperature and power consumption are simulated through control strategies of constant thermostat set point. The results show according the switch status, indoor air temperature can be calculated by the ETP model, thus give the desire status to the grid according the <b>setting</b> <b>temperature.</b> In summer, with the increasing of <b>setting</b> <b>temperature,</b> the frequency of on-off becomes lower, thus the power consumption also reduces from 1200 kW (26 °C) to 970 kW (27 °C).

40|$|Abstract: Self-curing acrylic cements, {{consisting}} {{mainly of}} polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), {{are widely used}} in dentistry and orthopedic surgery. One of the major side effects of the standard PMMA application is tissue necrosis at the bone-cement interface due {{to the rise of}} temperature during the polymerization reaction. This may also lead to aseptic loosening over time. Therefore, intense research is being carried out in the development of bone cements with new compositions. In this study, the aim was to develop new bone cement compositions that would have low <b>setting</b> <b>temperature</b> and high mechanical strength and be comparable with the commercially available ones. For this purpose, PMMA bone cements having various amounts of hydroxyapatite were prepared. In order to obtain a proper and homogeneous distribution of hydroxyapatite particles within the cement, very low-viscosity PMMA bone-cement compositions were developed. The addition of hydroxyapatite decreased the polymerization temperature (from 111 ¡C to 87 ¡C) and increased the compressive strength (from 110 MPa to 122 MPa) of the resultant cements. These new bone cements have <b>setting</b> <b>temperatures</b> and mechanical strengths comparable with commercially available cements and are believed to be more biocompatible since hydroxyapatite is a natural mineral present in the bone structure...|$|R
