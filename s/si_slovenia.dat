It documents the development of organic farming and its policy and regulatory environment in ten selected CEE states between 1997 and 2003. The countries included in the research are the Czech Republic (CZ), Estonia (EE), Hungary (HU), Poland (PL), <b>Slovenia</b> (<b>SI),</b> Latvia (LV), Lithuania (LT), Slovakia (SK), Bulgaria (BG) and Romania (RO). Countries were divided into two groups: the first group (CZ, EE, HU, PL and SI) was studied in more detail; a simplified questionnaire was used for the second (LV, LT, SK, BG and RO) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} land {{security management}} principles {{and practice in}} <b>Slovenia</b> (<b>Si)</b> by presenting a a real property transaction example that is formally described and modeled as a use case. first the legislation settings and {{the description of the}} dual real property registration system in Slovenia are shortly oulined. Then use case descriptions and UML diagramming examples of simplified real property transaction process are developed. The use case described is the sale of a whole urban built-up property with a detached house. Using the general-purpose Object oriented modeling language (UML) and following adopted system engineering methodology this transaction case is represented oil several diagrams: package, class, use case, activity and sequence (interaction). The article concludes with the analysis of the process, discussion of security pro vision for this real property transaction case, time span of similar transactions and the reasons for possible delays. Some considerations for improvements and reduction of the time needed can also be derived...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper first {{discusses}} polycentric regions, {{their features}} {{and how they}} can be detected by means of indicators of regional structure and mobility patterns, and why polycentric regions will be increasingly relevant to the future of mobility planning in the EU landscape. The paper discusses then the experience of six polycentric regions - Marche (IT), Central Alentejo (PT), Central Macedonia (GR), Rhine Alp (AT), Heart of <b>Slovenia</b> (<b>SI)</b> and Parkstad Limburg (NL) - that applied a Future Search (www. futuresearch. net) based methodology to urban mobility planning. It provides a critical analysis of the regions’ experience using the methodology and their plans to capitalise on its outcomes. This experience is used to develop and propose a Poly-SUMP participatory planning approach, with this new acronym being used for a new planning concept, i. e. Polycentric Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans. The paper discusses {{the pros and cons of}} the Poly-SUMP approach applied to the cities of polycentric regions, as opposed to the conventional methods used to elaborate Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans at the level of individual cities...|$|R
