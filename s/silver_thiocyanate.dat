5|$|However, {{the most}} {{important}} oxidation state for silver in complexes is +1. The Ag+ cation is diamagnetic, like its homologues Cu+ and Au+, as all three have closed-shell electron configurations with no unpaired electrons: its complexes are colourless provided the ligands are not too easily polarized such as I−. Ag+ forms salts with most anions, but it is reluctant to coordinate to oxygen and thus most of these salts are insoluble in water: the exceptions are the nitrate, perchlorate, and fluoride. The tetracoordinate tetrahedral aqueous ion + is known, but the characteristic geometry for the Ag+ cation is 2-coordinate linear. For example, silver chloride dissolves readily in excess aqueous ammonia to form +; silver salts are dissolved in photography due {{to the formation of}} the thiosulfate complex 3−; and cyanide extraction for silver (and gold) works by the formation of the complex −.

40|$|Two simple, {{accurate}} and selective methods for {{the determination of}} diphenhydramine in pharmaceutical grade sample and in dosage forms are described. The titrimetric method {{is based on the}} precipitation of the chloride content of the drug as AgCl with a known excess of silver nitrate and back titration of the residual <b>silver</b> nitrate with <b>thiocyanate</b> using iron(III) as indicator. The reaction stoichiometry and the range of determination have been evaluated. The spectrophotometric method involves the displacement of thiocyanate of mercuric thiocyanate from the ionized chloride and the subsequent reaction of the liberated thiocyanate with iron(III) to form the familiar red colored complex, Fe(SCN) (2 +) which is measured spectrophotometrically at 460 nm. The Beer's law is obeyed over the range 4 - 45 mug mL(- 1) of diphenhydramine HCl, the molar absorptivity and Sandell sensitivity being 3. 45 x 10 (3) L(.) mol(- 1) cm(- 1) and 84. 5 ng cm(2), respectively at 460 nm.

An improved method for generating thiocyanogen entails oxidation of plumbous thiocyanate, which precipitates when aqueous solutions of lead(II) nitrate and sodium thiocyanate are combined. A suspension of anhydrous Pb(SCN)2 is treated with bromine in glacial acetic acid to afford a 0.1M solution of thiocyanogen that is stable for days. Alternatively, a solution of bromine in methylene chloride is added dropwise to a suspension of Pb(SCN)2 in methylene chloride at 0 °C followed by filtration under argon to give a solution of thiocyanogen that should be used immediately.|$|E

The first method involved treatment of an aliphatic diamine with ammonium thiocyanate, under two {{different sets of}} reaction conditions. The first set of reaction conditions utilized water as the solvent, while second employed acetone as the solvent. Both of the reactions utilizing l, 2 -ethylenediamine and ammonium thiocyanate did not afford the desired bis(thioureas). In particular, the crystalline solid obtained from the reaction carried out in water was 57. 8 ± 0. 05 % thiocyanate by mass. The second nucleophilic addition method involved the treatment of both 1, 2 -ethylenediamine and 1, 6 -hexanediamine diamine with silicon tetraisothiocyanate in anhydrous benzene. The product from the reaction of l, 6 -hexanediamine with silicon tetraisothiocyanate in anhydrous benzene {{was found to be}} 40. 3 ± 2. 07 % thiocyanate by mass.
