40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{investigate the}} transmission dynamics of coherent matter wave pulses across finite optical lattices {{in both the}} linear and the nonlinear regimes. The shape {{and the intensity of}} the transmitted pulse are found to strongly depend on the parameters of the incident pulse, in particular its velocity and density: a clear physical picture for the main features observed in the numerical simulations is given in terms of the atomic band dispersion in the periodic potential of the optical lattice. Signatures of nonlinear effects due the atom-atom interaction are discussed in detail, such as atom optical limiting and atom optical bistability. For positive scattering lengths, matter waves propagating close {{to the top of the}} valence band are shown to be subject to modulational instability. A new scheme for the experimental generation of narrow bright gap solitons from a wide Bose-Einstein condensate is proposed: the modulational instability is seeded in a controlled way starting from the strongly modulated density profile of a <b>standing</b> <b>matter</b> wave and the solitonic nature of the generated pulses is checked from their shape and their collisional properties...|$|E
40|$|Although saccadic eye {{movements}} {{move the}} retinal image several times per second we perceive a stable outside world. How the visual system manages {{this has been}} a long <b>standing</b> <b>matter</b> of neuroscientific research. An internal neural signal sent from the brainstem to the frontal eye field via mediodorsal thalamus seems to play an important role. However a direct link between integrity of frontal oculomotor areas and perceptual stability has been missing so far. The objective {{of the present study was}} to provide an experimental contribution to this question and especially characterize the role of the frontal eye field. To infer on transsaccadic integration of visual space we tested healthy subjects in an oculomotor paradigm. During the execution of a saccadic eye movement the visual target was displaced and performance of detection was evaluated. Afterwards we specifically modulated the neural activity of the right frontal eye field by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation. Subsequently the detection performance was reassessed. The results show that all subjects exhibited the tendency to report a backward displacement. This was observed even for trials with a physical nondisplacement or a forward displacement. Thus a systematic bias in the evaluation of transsaccadic target displacement was observed. Detection thresholds were significantly increased especially for leftward saccades. The analysis of oculomotor saccade parameters showed no impairments. And conducting the same experiment without saccadic eye movements but fixation at screen center did not achieve any significant changes of perception of target displacements. These results suggest that the integration of visual space across eye movements based on a transthalamic monitoring signal can be disturbed by interference with frontal activity. These findings assign an important role to the human frontal eye field in the matching of visual space across the frequent displacements induced by saccadic eye movements...|$|E
40|$|Even {{though an}} {{increasing}} number of pilot-scale plants are demonstrating the potential efficiency of the Ca-looping technology to capture CO 2 at a commercial level, a still <b>standing</b> <b>matter</b> of concern is the loss of carbonation reactivity of the regenerated CaO by calcination, which is expected to be particularly marked at realistic conditions necessarily implying a high CO 2 partial pressure in the calciner. In this work, we address the effect of previously reported strategies for sorbent reactivation, namely heat pretreatment and the introduction of a recarbonation stage before regeneration. Both techniques, either combined or separately, are shown to favor the carbonation reactivity, albeit CaO regeneration is usually carried out at low CO 2 partial pressure in lab-scale tests. Novel results reported in this paper show the opposite when the sorbent is regenerated by calcination at high CO 2 concentration, which is arguably due to the diverse mechanisms that rule decarbonation depending on the CO 2 concentration in the calciner atmosphere. Dynamic and reversible adsorption/desorption of CO 2 is thought to govern decarbonation during calcination at high CO 2 partial pressure, which would be hindered by the introduction of a recarbonation stage before carbonation. Moreover, carbonation in the fast phase is severely hampered {{as a result of the}} marked loss of reactivity of the surface of CaO regenerated under high CO 2 partial pressure. On the other hand, heat pretreatment and harsh calcination conditions lead to a notable enhancement of diffusion, which would favor the process efficiency. In these conditions, diffusion controlled carbonation becomes a significant contribution to CaO conversion, which is notably increased by prolonging the carbonation stage. Heat pretreatment allows also reducing the calcination temperature at high CO 2 partial pressure while still achieving full decarbonation in short residence times. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Objects {{are there}} to be used. Throughout history, the gifting of objects has been a {{universal}} activity. Anthropologists, sociologists, economists, philosophers, and historians (amongst others) have all grappled to define the role that gift-giving has played in diverse human societies. The act of gifting immediately modifies {{the value of an}} object, transfiguring it into a ‘gift’. Once defined as a gift, both the object and its presentation contain particular meanings which resonate within the context of its exchange: the gift both communicates a message and a bond between sender and recipient. The resulting web of connections formed by gift exchanges are arguably the sinews of complex societies. The gift debits and credits, it obligates and liberates, it intimates and discriminates, not only between the one who gifts and the one who receives, but by those who view its exchange (who interpret the symbolism of a gift as indicative of a relationship or favour). In a society in which loyalty, gratitude, obligation, courtesy, personal conduct, and social <b>standing</b> <b>matter</b> acutely – for example, sixteenth-century Europe – the gift is a truly efficacious social tool. In the hands of someone who understands the communicative power of objects, particularly artworks, but not solely – for example, Cosimo I de’ Medici (1519 - 1574) – then gifts, both those given and received, can force the actions of others, influence the perception of the audience, and effect the realisation of political objectives. As such, the Florentine court – famous for its magnificent collections of objects – represents an outstanding historical context in which to analyse the efficacy of gifts and the social and political world of material culture they inhabit. This thesis draws upon a vast trove of unpublished archival material to study the potency of gifts in the diplomacy of Cosimo I de’ Medici, duke of Florence (from 1537), later Siena (from 1557), and finally, grand duke of Tuscany (from 1570). As well as portraying the social value of the gift in sixteenth-century Europe and tracing the influence of gifts and their presentation in the iconographic programme of the Palazzo Vecchio, this thesis also presents a diplomatic biography of Cosimo I through the gifts he sent and received...|$|E

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} show that {{immigrants}} exhibit higher levels of trust in public institutions than natives. This study uses pooled data from the European Social Survey to examine possible reasons for this ‘over-confidence’ of immigrants, arguing that it is largely the relatively lower expectations of immigrants from countries with poorer institutional performance that account for this difference. The eminent role of expectations is also underscored by the finding that low social <b>standing</b> <b>matters</b> less for the level of trust of immigrants than it does for natives. The ‘frame of reference effect’ weakens over time and with increased acculturation {{in the country of}} residence, suggesting that expectations are less strongly based on experiences in the country of origin the better integrated an immigrant is in the country of residence. A small part of immigrants’ higher trust levels and of the dual frames of reference effect are mediated by the more conservative value orientations of immigrants from countries with lower political stability, who appear to regard stability and conformity more highly. However, the overall pattern of effects indicates that lower rather than different expectations explain immigrants’ higher levels of institutional trust.

40|$|Democratic {{procedures}} {{allow us}} to decide as a society what to do. We intuitively embrace the ideal of a democratic state. But do we need democracy? Some argue that the social institutions we need to live well legitimately evolve through the spontaneous and decentralized activity of free individuals, thereby making democratic decisions unnecessary. But because unjust inequalities in power inevitably develop through the evolution of property regimes and market systems, there are strong moral reasons for the community to establish democratic procedures to monitor and rehabilitate these historically entrenched institutions. Executing this corrective function is a central reason why we do in fact need democracy. Yet there is considerable disagreement about democracy's precise justification beyond this functional rationale. John Stuart Mill and Richard Arneson both argue for {{the claim that the}} justification of popular rule is solely a matter of democracy's ability to generate morally correct outcomes. I reject these views. Democracy is valuable beyond being a means to some other morally desirable ends. Democracy is justified, I argue, because it is an intrinsically just procedure. The challenge is to understand what this means. Joshua Cohen suggests that democracy is intrinsically just because in the process of democratic deliberation reasonable citizens are given reasons to accept exercises of state power. I reject Cohen's deliberative model because it does not adequately appreciate the range of moral disagreement in contemporary democracies. Further, the standard of reasonableness at the heart of his justification for democracy is not consistent with the use of majority rule, an essential element of the democratic process. Instead, I argue that democracy is an intrinsically just procedure because it distributes political power over the decisions regarding the basic rules of social life equally, and thereby satisfies each individual's interest in the public affirmation of his or her basic social <b>standing.</b> Democracy <b>matters</b> because the public declaration of equal moral <b>standing</b> <b>matters...</b>|$|R

Quantitative estimates of pasture biomass or total <b>standing</b> dry <b>matter</b> (TSDM) at the field scale are much desired by land managers for land-resource management, forage budgeting, and conservation purposes. Estimates from optical satellite imagery alone tend to saturate in the cover-to-mass relationship and fail to differentiate <b>standing</b> dry <b>matter</b> from litter. X-band radar imagery was added to complement optical imagery with a structural component to improve TSDM estimates in rangelands. High quality paddock-scale field data from a northeastern Australian cattle grazing trial were used to establish a statistical TSDM model by integrating optical satellite image data from the Landsat sensor with observations from the TerraSAR-X (TSX) radar satellite. Data from the dry season of 2014 and the wet season of 2015 resulted in models with adjusted r 2 of 0. 81 in the dry season and 0. 74 in the wet season.

A correction factor was developed based on the water content of sediment samples that corrects sediment bacteria microscopic counts for masking due to sediment particles. Using this correction factor, it was found that sediment bacterial biomass in 22 lakes was positively related to an indicator of the rate of allochthonous organic matter input to lakes. However, the total hypolimnetic carbon mineralization rate of lakes, which integrates both sediment and hypolimnetic water column mineralization, was found to be driven mainly by phytoplankton carbon and to occur mainly in the hypolimnetic water column.

Summer grain/winter cover [sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.

All crops were successfully established, irrespective of tillage and cover crop management. Although pearl millet was often lower in the plant stand with NT than with CT, plants compensated with greater biomass on an area basis. Across years, grain yield of sorghum (1. 9 Mg ha- 1 during three seasons) and corn (7. 3 Mg ha- 1 in one season) was 25 % greater under NT than under CT when the cover crop was not grazed.
