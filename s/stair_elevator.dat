40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a description of}} a new agent based elevator sub-model developed as part of the buildingEXODUS software intended for both evacuation and circulation applications. A description of each component of the newly developed model is presented, including the elevator kinematics and associated pedestrian behaviour. The elevator model is then used to investigate a series of full building evacuation scenarios based on a hypothetical 50 floor building with four staircases and a population of 7, 840 agents. The analysis explores the relative merits of using up to 32 elevators (arranged in four banks) and various egress strategies to evacuate the entire building population. Findings from the investigation suggest that the most efficient evacuation strategy utilises a combination of elevators and stairs to empty the building and clear the upper half of the building in minimum time. Combined <b>stair</b> <b>elevator</b> evacuation times {{have been shown to be}} as much as 50 % faster than stair only evacuation times...|$|E

Among these motion states, walking <b>stairs,</b> taking <b>elevators,</b> and taking escalators {{can be considered as}} landmarks to aid user heading estimation.|$|R

Its two laboratory towers and service tower (for <b>stairs,</b> <b>elevators,</b> etc.) are connected {{in a straight line}} to the westernmost tower of the Richards building. A research library is located in Goddard's upper floors with reading carrels that cantilever from the building's face.|$|R

50|$|The {{box-shaped}} building, {{designed by}} Bruce Graham of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill, was {{designed in the}} International Style with large columns and spandrel beams expressed on each facade and covered in anodized aluminum, complimented by large windows on all four sides of the building. As in many office towers, a core containing <b>stairs,</b> <b>elevators,</b> and bathrooms lies at the center.|$|R
50|$|Inside {{the station}} building, escalators, <b>stairs</b> and an <b>elevator</b> {{provide access to}} the {{mezzanine}} level where the pedestrian overpass connects the station to Bow Trail and the Greyhound Bus Depot. From the mezzanine level, a further two sets of escalators, <b>stairs,</b> and <b>elevators</b> provide access up to the side-loading platform.|$|R
50|$|In {{the plane}} of a {{specific}} floor, the non-standard layout loosely manipulates {{the layout of the}} floor plan. The size of each tube is determined by its internal function - <b>stairs,</b> <b>elevator,</b> light shaft. Moreover, since the exact dimensions of the tubes vary from floor to floor, this variation, along with differentiation in the lighting colours between floors, adds a distinctive character to each level. Structure becomes ornamentation.|$|R

50|$|In every game, {{the player}} character, Agent 47, has limited maneuverability; he cannot jump, scale walls, or mantle up ledges (there {{are a few}} pre-scripted places where he can jump from one balcony to another, but these are very rare). This {{generally}} limits the player to a single plane of movement, although he is often presented the opportunity to move to higher or lower areas {{through the use of}} ladders, <b>stairs,</b> <b>elevators,</b> or hills.|$|R
50|$|SM City San Jose del Monte’s {{interiors}} {{are organized}} around a central atrium that terraces back at each level, allowing natural clerestory light to reach {{deep into the}} building. Pedestrian bridges cross the atrium on each floor, while <b>stairs,</b> <b>elevators,</b> and escalators traverse the space vertically, contributing to the dynamic feel of the interior. The space is further accentuated by vivid bands of color which give the space a festive, contemporary appearance.|$|R
2500|$|In the Richards building, {{laboratories}} {{are housed}} in three towers attached in pinwheel formation to a central fourth tower that houses mechanical systems, research animals, <b>stairs</b> and <b>elevators.</b> [...] Each laboratory tower has eight floors, {{each of which is}} a 45foot (13.5m) square that is entirely free of <b>stairs,</b> <b>elevators</b> and internal support columns. [...] Each tower is supported by eight external columns that are attached to the four edges of each floor at [...] "third-point" [...] locations, the two points on each side that divide it into three equal parts. [...] That placement resulted in four column-free cantilevered corners on each floor, which Kahn filled with windows. [...] The support structure of these towers consists of pre-stressed concrete elements that were fabricated off-site and assembled on-site with a crane.|$|R
50|$|The {{converted}} twin silos were raw concrete cylinders, standing 42 metres {{tall and}} 25 metres wide. The hollow cores of the silos {{are used for}} the infrastructure of the building, <b>stairs,</b> <b>elevators</b> and hallways. The two silos are connected on each floor, giving the building a basic layout resemblying the infinity symbol, ∞. The two rotundas are capped with a Texlon roof for natural light, creating a lobby area as tall as the building itself, within which residents and visitors can move up and down.|$|R

50|$|Cast iron {{was a major}} 19th century {{building}} material of the Industrial Revolution. Although brittle, it is remarkably strong in compression. It was frequently used for structural purposes, such as columns, building fronts, domes and light courts. Decorative uses have included <b>stairs,</b> <b>elevators,</b> lintels, grilles, verandas, balconies, railings, fences, streetlights, and tombs. The Bradbury Building {{is an example of}} extensive decorative cast iron. Today, cast iron is used for plumbing fixtures and piping in new construction, and its structural and decorative use is used occasionally through historic preservation practices.|$|R
50|$|The {{stations}} are connected via several sets of <b>stairs,</b> <b>elevators,</b> and escalators. There is an underground, lower mezzanine for the Canarsie Line, and an aboveground, upper mezzanine for the Myrtle Avenue Line. The main fare control is at street level, through the station house, though another fare control {{exists on the}} lower mezzanine for the Canarsie Line platform only. There are three elevators: one from the Canarsie Line to the lower mezzanine; one from the lower mezzanine to street level and the upper mezzanine; and one from the upper mezzanine to the Myrtle Avenue Line. There are also escalators from the lower to the upper mezzanine. The lower mezzanine is full-length, but the upper mezzanine consists of {{little more than a}} landing for the <b>stairs,</b> escalators, and <b>elevators</b> below the middle of the Myrtle Avenue Line platform.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} two {{platforms}} {{which can be}} accessed via an elevated concourse located below the platforms, while <b>stairs</b> and <b>elevators</b> also give passengers access to ground level just below the concourse.|$|R

50|$|There are 18 skyboxes, {{elevated}} {{above the}} concourse and accessible by <b>stairs</b> or <b>elevator</b> for ticket-holders only. The skyboxes and their outdoor seating serve as {{cover for the}} main concourse below, and for the top couple rows of reserved seats.|$|R
30|$|In the experiments, a 10 -story {{building}} was used and 6 people {{were placed on}} each floor. The scheduled fire was set on the 10 th floor. The same number of <b>stairs,</b> <b>elevators,</b> and exits with the same locations were used for each experiment. Two different age groups were tested: young adults vs. older adults. Older adults had more physical limitations than young adults in terms of walking speed and sight distance. For each age group, two experiments were conducted: one with the agents who had fire drills {{and the other with}} the agents who had no fire drills. Those who had fire drills could find stairs and exits more quickly than those who had not.|$|R
