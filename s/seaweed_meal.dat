50|$|A. nodosum is {{harvested}} {{for use in}} alginates, fertilisers, and {{the manufacture}} of <b>seaweed</b> <b>meal</b> for animal and human consumption. It has long been used as an organic and mainstream fertilizer for many varieties of crops due to its combination of both macronutrients, (N, P, and K) and micronutrients (Ca, Mg, S, Mn, Cu, Fe, Zn, etc.). It also contains cytokinins, auxin-like gibberellins, betaines, mannitol, organic acids, polysaccharides, amino acids, and proteins which are all very beneficial and widely used in agriculture. Ireland, Scotland and Norway have provided the world's principal alginate supply.|$|E
50|$|The {{most widely}} used {{potassium}} fertilizer is potassium chloride (muriate of potash). Other inorganic potassium fertilizers include potassium nitrate, potassium sulfate, and monopotassium phosphate. Potassium-rich treatments suitable for organic farming include feeding with home-made comfrey liquid, adding <b>seaweed</b> <b>meal,</b> composted bracken, and compost rich in decayed banana peels. Wood ash also has high potassium content. Adequate moisture is necessary for effective potassium uptake; low soil water reduces K uptake by plant roots. Liming acidic soils can increase potassium retention in some soils by reducing leaching; practices that increase soil organic matter can also increase potassium retention.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the current experiment was to compare the effects of supplementing mid-lactation dairy cows with all-rac-α-tocopheryl acetate (SyntvE), RRR-α-tocopheryl acetate (NatvE) or <b>seaweed</b> <b>meal</b> (Seaweed) {{in the presence of}} a Control group (no supplemental vitamin E or seaweed) on the concentration of α-tocopherol in plasma and milk, and antibody response following immunization. The hypothesis was that supplementation of dairy cows with vitamin E, regardless of its form, would increase plasma and milk α-tocopherol compared to the control diet and this incremental response would be bigger with NatvE than SyntvE. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that vitamin E, regardless of its form, will provide an improved adaptive immune response to immunization than the Control diet, and cows supplemented with <b>Seaweed</b> <b>meal</b> would produce better adaptive immune response following immunization than cows in the Control group. Twenty-four Norwegian Red (NR) dairy cows in their mid-lactation were allocated randomly to the four treatments in a replicated Latin square design. The cows were fed on a basal diet of silage and concentrate on top of which the experimental supplements were provided. Plasma and milk α-tocopherol concentrations were higher in NatvE and SyntvE groups than in the other two groups. The RRR-α-tocopherol stereoisomer was the predominant form (> 0 · 86), in both plasma and milk, whereas the remaining part was largely made up of the other three 2 R stereoisomers (RRS, RSR and RSS). In cows fed the Control, Seaweed and NatvE, the proportion of the RRR-α-tocopherol stereoisomer in plasma and milk constituted > 0 · 97 of the total α-tocopherol. Mid-lactation NR dairy cows had higher than adequate levels of plasma α-tocopherol (9 · 99 mg/l) even when not supplemented with external source of vitamin E, suggesting that with a good quality silage these cows may not be at risk of vitamin E deficiency. Furthermore, the present study shows that dairy cows in mid to late lactation have preferential uptake of RRR stereoisomer of α-tocopherol compared with other stereoisomers. All cows responded well to immunization with different antigens, but there were no significant group effects of the diet on the immune response measured...|$|E

BACKGROUND: Eight natural products from animal, unicellular algae, brown seaweed and plant origins were chosen according to their theoretical anti-microbial activity: Diatomaceous earths (DE), insoluble chitosan (ICHI), soluble chitosan (CHI), <b>seaweed</b> <b>meal</b> (SWM), Ascophyllum nodosum (ASC), Laminaria digitata (LAM), Neem oil (NOIL) and an Ivy fruit extract rich in saponins (IVY). Dose-response incubations were conducted to determine their effect on rumen fermentation pattern and gas production, while their anti-protozoal activity was tested using (14) C-labelled bacteria. RESULTS: DE, SWM, NOIL and ICHI had very small effects on rumen function when used at inclusion rate up to 2 g L(- 1). ASC had anti-protozoal effects (up to - 23 %) promoting a decrease in gas production and methanogenesis (- 15 %). LAM increased VFA production (+ 7 %) and shifted from butyrate to acetate. CHI also shifted fermentation towards propionate production and lower methane (- 23 %) and protozoal activity (- 56 %). IVY decreased protozoal activity (- 39 %) and ammonia concentration (- 56 %), as well as increased feed fermentation (+ 11 % VFA concentration) and shifted from acetate to propionate production. CONCLUSIONS: ASC, LAM, CHI and IVY showed promising potential in vitro as feed additives to improve rumen function, thus {{more research is needed to}} investigate their mode of action in the rumen microbial ecosystem. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|E

The basal diet had 5 % corn starch and 5 % wheat flour as binders and served as the control diet. A second study used the seaweed meals at 5, 10 or 15 % plus 5 % wheat flour and a control diet {{containing}} 15 % wheat flour (no <b>seaweed</b> <b>meal).</b> These two sets of diets were fed to juvenile tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon, to assess the acceptability of the seaweed meals in terms of shrimp growth and survival. In both studies, diets with 10 % G. heteroclada had the highest water stability after 4 h but differences among diets were minimal. In study 1, shrimp fed diets with 3 % and 5 % K. alvarezii and 10 % G. heteroclada had the highest total biomass and those fed the diet containing 5 % K. alvarezii the highest specific growth rate (SGR). Shrimp survival was highest with those fed 3 % K. alvarezii and decreased as K. alvarezii was increased. Survival was not affected by the level of G. heteroclada in the diet. Diets with 3 % and 5 % K. alvarezii had the best feed conversion ratio (FCR). With a modified binder composition in study 2, total biomass and SGR of shrimp fed 10 % G. heteroclada did not significantly differ from the control, nor from 10 % K. alvarezii and 5 % G. heteroclada. Diets with 5 % and 10 % K. alvarezii or G. heteroclada had the best FCR.

We used 60 New Zealand White rabbits of both sexes, at 30 days of age. The experimental diets were isonitrogenous and isocaloric, a control and the other with the different levels of inclusion of Lithothamnium sp. to replace the inert (bentonite) from the control diet ad libitum. The experimental design was completely randomized, with five treatments and twelve repetitions. The variables were subjected to analysis of variance and regression analysis model with pre-defined by the statistical program SAEG. The results showed that the inclusion of Lithothamnium sp. in different concentrations did not interfere in the variables studied: intake, digestibility coefficients of dry matter, protein and energy, weight gain, carcass yield and weight of edible offal. However, it was verified that the level of inclusion of 1. 0 % interfere in a negative way in the length and width of villi.
