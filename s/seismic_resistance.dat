40|$|Computation of <b>seismic</b> passive <b>resistance</b> and {{its point}} of {{application}} is {{an important aspect of}} seismic design of retaining wall. Several researchers in the past had obtained seismic passive earth pressures by using the conventional pseudo-static method. In this pseudo-static method, peak ground acceleration is assumed as constant and seismic passive pressure thus obtained shows the linear variation along the height of the retaining wall. There is hardly any scope to find out the {{point of application}} of <b>seismic</b> passive <b>resistance</b> by pseudo-static approach but to assume it to act at one-third height {{from the base of the}} wall. Rectifying these errors, in recently developed pseudo-dynamic method of analysis, all these factors are considered to compute seismic passive earth pressures. In this paper, an attempt has been made to compute the point of application of <b>seismic</b> passive <b>resistance</b> using limit equilibrium method of analysis with pseudo-dynamic approach. Effects of variation of parameters like wall friction angle, time period of earthquake ground motion, seismic shear and primary wave velocities of backfill soil, soil amplification and seismic peak horizontal and vertical ground accelerations on the seismic passive earth pressure are studied. © IACMA...|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{evaluating}} the seismic capacity of existing reinforced concrete (R/C) building was developed by implementing a diagonal strut model for considering brick infill effects. In this model, the strut width {{is presented as a}} function of frame-infill contact length, which was evaluated by static equilibriums related to compression balance and lateral displacement compatibility at the frame-infill interfaces. The lateral strength and stiffness of infill were obtained based on the strut width. The strut model has been verified through comparison with experimental results of a brick masonry infilled R/C frame. Good agreements were observed between the experimental and analytical performance on the lateral strength and ductility of the infill. Consequently, the diagonal strut model can be an effective tool for precisely screening earthquake-vulnerable existing R/C buildings in Padang city. In this study, two calculations of seismic capacity of two stories existing R/C building, without and with considering brick infill effects, were conducted by applying the diagonal strut model. However, the seismic capacity of R/C building without infill effect was evaluated based on Japanese standard.

40|$|In {{earthquake}} prone areas, {{understanding of}} the <b>seismic</b> passive earth <b>resistance</b> {{is very important for}} the design of different geotechnical earth retaining structures. In this study, the limit equilibrium method is used for estimation of critical <b>seismic</b> passive earth <b>resistance</b> for an inclined wall supporting horizontal cohesionless backfill. A composite failure surface is considered in the present analysis. Seismic forces are computed assuming the backfill soil as a viscoelastic material overlying a rigid stratum and the rigid stratum is subjected to a harmonic shaking. The present method satisfies the boundary conditions. The amplification of acceleration depends on the properties of the backfill soil and on the characteristics of the input motion. The acceleration distribution along the depth of the backfill is found to be nonlinear in nature. The present study shows that the horizontal and vertical acceleration distribution in the backfill soil is not always in-phase for the critical value of the seismic passive earth pressure coefficient. The effect of different parameters on the seismic passive earth pressure is studied in detail. A comparison of the present method with other theories is also presented, which shows the merits of the present study...|$|R

In the current study, a closed-form solution to compute the seismic passive earth pressure on nonvertical rigid retaining wall retaining a backfill with full submergence is proposed using the modified pseudo-dynamic approach. A nonlinear rupture surface (logarithmic spiral+straight line) in a submerged backfill of viscoelastic nature has been assumed. The presented modified pseudo-dynamic method overcomes the limitations of the existing pseudo-dynamic method for submerged soils. The proposed methodology has been thoroughly validated with the available literature. The influences of seismic acceleration coefficients, excess pore water pressure ratio, wall inclination, and soil and wall friction angles have been studied. It has been noticed that the consideration of excess pore pressure ratio leads to significant decrease in <b>seismic</b> passive <b>resistance</b> of the soil which in turn lead to extra hydraulic pressure acting on the wall in submerged backfill.

Not {{collapse}} under strong earthquake {{is an important}} goal of the seismic design of reinforced concrete structure, <b>seismic</b> collapse <b>resistance</b> performance is directly affected by the deformation behavior of reinforced concrete column.

In this paper, the ultimate displacement angle of concrete columns with high-strength materials were collected, the ultimate displacement angle and inter-story drift angle 1 / 50 were compared and analyzed. The results show that the average of ultimate displacement angle of the reinforced concrete column with high-strength stirrup and high-strength longitudinal bars are 0. 0469, 0. 0312, respectively, greater than inter-story drift angle 1 / 50, while the average of ultimate displacement angle with high-strength concrete and high-strength core concrete are 0. 0147, 0. 0167, less than 1 / 50, therefore, it is not suitable for taking 1 / 50 as the critical value of structure collapse with high-strength concrete.

The in-plane flexibility of floor diaphragms at the interface between the two substructures with different geometries was simulated to identify the most critical wind conditions for each structural member.

40|$|In {{developing}} nations, such as Nepal, {{the structural}} integrity of houses and other buildings {{is not up}} to a high standard {{due to the lack of}} updated building codes and economic constraints. This leads to structures that are vulnerable to seismic damage, such as the ones damaged in the 2015 earthquake in Nepal.

The proposed mortar-less interlocking block system is intended to allow communities to create structurally sound buildings at lower costs due to reduced need for skilled masons. By being able to interlock the Concrete Masonry Unit (CMU) blocks, no mortar is required to connect the blocks.
