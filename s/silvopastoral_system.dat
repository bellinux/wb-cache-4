A Malaise trap for collecting insects was installed in a B. decumbens area managed as a <b>silvopastoral</b> <b>system,</b> and another was installed in a monoculture system. Hymenoptera richness and abundance were determined based on the number of morphospecies and specimens, respectively. The diversity and constancy indices were calculated using the Shannon?Wiener and Bodenheimer methodologies. Fifteen families of Hymenoptera were collected, seven of which were unique to the monoculture system. The samples from the <b>silvopastoral</b> <b>system</b> were significantly more abundant (3, 889) and rich (305) compared with those from the monoculture system, which were much less abundant (1, 473) and rich (173). Similar trends were noted for the families Formicidae, Ichneumonidae, and Braconidae. Additionally, these families and Sphecidae showed significantly greater diversity in the <b>silvopastoral</b> <b>system.</b> Formicidae and Braconidae were constant in both systems, while Ichneumonidae was constant only in the <b>silvopastoral</b> <b>system.</b> The families Vespidae, Pompilidae, and Apidae were more diverse; Chalcididae, Pompilidae, Sphecidae, Halictidae, Evaniidae, and Gasteruptiidae were more abundant; and Vespidae had more richness in the monoculture system.

The experiment {{was carried out in}} an area of Leucaena (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.)

A completely randomised design with four treatments and five replications was adopted. Growing goats were used; the control group being fed only on pasture, and the other groups supplemented with ground maize at 0. 5, 0. 9 and 1. 3 % of live weight. Supplementation reduced grazing time and increased rumination and idle time; although the goats spent approximately 85 % of the time grazing on grasses, indicating a preference for this forage. Energy supplementation increased the weight gain per animal per unit area. Under a <b>silvopastoral</b> <b>system</b> of leucaena and tropical grasses, goats prefer the grasses, however, grazing on the legume results in a protein intake that justifies additional energy input.

The initial estimation of the model parameters was based on an extensive literature review and on existing data sets with tree and pasture measurements. Yield-SAFE calibration procedure was successfully performed for trees. However, Yield-SAFE model was not adequately calibrated for pasture probably due to the multi specific pasture composition with different light and humidity requirements, responding differently to multiannual harvests.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess milk yields, {{estimate}} the intake of crude protein (CP) and determine the concentrations of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in early post-partum crossbred cows grazing irrigated Leucaena leucocephala (leucaena) in a <b>silvopastoral</b> <b>system</b> relative to those in an irrigated grass monoculture.  Twenty-four multiparous cows were randomly allotted at calving on the basis of previous milk yields to 2 grazing treatments: grass monoculture system (MS) of Cynodon nlemfuensis (n= 12); and an intensive <b>silvopastoral</b> <b>system</b> (ISS) composed of leucaena and C. nlemfuensis (n= 12).  Cows were supplemented with sorghum grain (ISS) or a conventional concentrate (MS) during milking to ensure availability of metabolizable energy (ME) and CP required for milk production.  Mean estimated intake of leucaena was 5. 1 ± 1. 3 kg DM/d and estimated CP intakes were 1, 479 ± 3. 3 and 1, 258 ± 3. 3 g/d for ISS and MS, respectively (P> 0. 05), while estimated intakes of ME were 161 ± 1. 3 and 131 ± 1. 4 MJ/d for ISS and MS, respectively (P 0. 05).  Concentrations of BUN were 19. 1 mg/dL for cows in ISS and 15. 3 mg/dL for cows in MS (P< 0. 05).  We conclude that intake of leucaena and sorghum grain in an irrigated <b>silvopastoral</b> <b>system</b> was sufficient to substitute for expensive concentrate in the diets of lactating cows grazing irrigated grass monoculture.  However, the higher levels of BUN found in ISS suggest a lower efficiency of N utilization in this treatment.  Restricting consumption of leucaena might be a means of improving efficiency of its use and this warrants investigation.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of spacing on eucalyptus dendrometric characteristics in <b>silvopastoral</b> <b>system</b> with Brachiaria decumbens. Three eucalyptus spacing were used (3 x 2, 6 x 4 and 10 x 4 m). The randomized block design was used with factorial scheme (3 x 4) with three densities of planting eucalyptus (3 x 2, 6 x 4 and 10 x 4 m) and four times of evaluation (6, 12, 18 and 24 months after planting). The dendrometric characteristics were evaluated: 0, 30 m diameter, diameter at breast height - 1. 30 m (DBH), cup diameter, height, biomass per tree and plant survival. It was found positive effect of months of evaluation for the diameter to 0. 30 m, cup diameter and height. There were no effects of spacing for the variables DBH, survival and biomass per tree when evaluated at 24 months. There was effect for biomass per hectare being 3 x 2 m the best treatament. It can be concluded that the planting spacing only affected the biomass per hectare, when evaluated up to 24 months of Eucalyptus urophylla grown in <b>silvopastoral</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E
40|$|Agroforestry has {{not been}} adopted in the UK despite the {{potential}} it has to diversify output while reducing the opportunity cost of lost agricultural production. In part this reflects the limited nature of the grant aid available. This article demonstrates that the current pro rata restriction that grant aid is paid {{in proportion to the}} number of stems planted means that annual incomes derived from silvoarable or <b>silvopastoral</b> <b>systems</b> compare poorly with those from agricultural enterprises alone. By facilitating a greater variety in the spatial arrangement of trees, agroforestry systems offer a potential diversity of landscape forms and wildlife habitats that are not available from conventional plantation forestry. The article argues that this contribution to environmental diversity should be reflected in the level of grant aid provided for agroforestry. <b>Silvopastoral</b> <b>systems</b> based on sheep are shown to offer the greatest potential, and proposals are made for encouraging the development of such systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of free range areas and grassland on organic farms for performing natural behaviour and offering natural feed {{is not fully}} utilized yet.

We try to ‘solve’ these problems by introducing forestry in animal production and designing <b>silvopastoral</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Silvopastoral</b> <b>systems,</b> which are the combination of trees and livestock, are applied traditionally already long times in ‘low input systems’ in Africa and in Mediterranean countries.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of modern agroforestry requires a strong complementarity between tradition and innovation. In Italy, agroforestry has been historically {{a key component}} of agriculture and the landscape. Complex systems, based on the integration among crops, animal husbandry, and fruit/forest trees provided a wide variety of productions and ecosystem services (food, feed, fibres, fuel wood and timber, soil nutrients recycling, and biodiversity preservation). Forest grazing and <b>silvopastoral</b> <b>systems</b> have been used for centuries, and are still managed in marginal areas. The integration of fruits trees (in primis olive trees) with crops and grazing was widely practised and is still profitable. Peculiar systems, called "coltura promiscua" (i. e. mixed crops), were historically developed with the integration of fruit and forest trees to supporting vines and intercrops; multifunctional timber trees (e. g. Juglans regia, Prunus avium) were very often cultivated in such systems. Today, international research projects on innovation in agroforestry are being carried out. The adoption of shade tolerant forage species and crops is studied for introduction into <b>silvopastoral</b> <b>systems</b> or in olive groves. <b>Silvopastoral</b> <b>systems</b> can significantly offset the CO 2 emissions produced by the livestock and shield the grazing animals from "heat waves". Integration of fast growing timber trees (like Populus) in arable systems can significantly reverse the recent crisis of plantation forestry in Italy. Finally, the constraints imposed by the EU agricultural policy to the agroforestry development are reviewed. The prevalent provisions for monocrops severely limited the introduction of innovative agroforestry approaches. New political measures and certification actions are strongly required...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the nutritive value and in situ rumen degradability of grass collected from different locations within the pasture in a <b>silvopastoral</b> <b>system</b> with different densities of trees. The <b>silvopastoral</b> <b>system</b> consisted of Urochloa (syn. Brachiaria) brizantha cv. Marandu and the babassu palm, Orbignya sp. (now: Attaleia speciosa). We used a completely randomized design with a 3 x 3 factorial arrangement for nutritional value (3 differently shaded locations and 3 palm tree densities) and a 3 x 3 x 3 factorial arrangement for dry matter (DM) disappearance (3 locations, 3 palm densities and 3 incubation times). There was no effect of location within the pasture nor of palm tree density on the concentrations of NDF, ADF, lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose. However, location influenced the concentrations of crude protein (CP) and DM, with highest CP in material grown in full sunlight. At all densities, DM disappearance at 96 h for pasture grown in full sunlight exceeded that for pasture grown in full shade. These factors need to be compounded with the possible depressant effect of trees on DM production of pasture when considering the benefits of silvopastoral systems.

40|$|Silvopastoral systems should aim to {{optimize}} {{production of a}} tree component and crops and/ or animals within the same land-management unit. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of lime and two dose of sewage sludge applied in three dates on productivity and carbon sequestration in soil, pasture and tree in a <b>silvopastoral</b> <b>system</b> reforested with Pinus radiata D. Don. The results obtained showed that lime and sewage sludge inputs (high dose), caused an improvement of the soil edaphic conditions, without a negative impact derived from the accumulation of heavy metals. Initially, lime applications increased pasture-tree competition, however later we detected a recovery of the forest species in limed plots which received contributions of high dose of sewage sludge. A clear interaction between the dose and the date of application of sewage sludge was observed. Early fertilization with high dose caused a reduction of tree growth, due to increase of the development of herbaceous species. On the contrary, the later inputs of high sewage sludge dose increase the initial tree growth and shrub species, being this date more favourable for the tree growth than to the development of herbaceous pasture. The soil was the component of the <b>silvopastoral</b> <b>system</b> that mostly contributed to carbon sequestration followed tree component...|$|E
40|$|Tree growth, {{understorey}} {{characteristics and}} soil parameters were evaluated in a <b>silvopastoral</b> <b>system</b> in northern Greece at seven and twelve {{years after its}} establishment. The experiment was laid out in  1992 and included three understorey treatments (grass, legume and control- unsown), two tree species - sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and two tree spacings (2. 5 x 2. 5 m and  3. 5 x 3. 5 m). Tree height was taller in the control and in the dense stands while Scots pine had better growth but, higher mortality than sycamore in the both periods. In 2004, understorey vegetation was uniform under the three understorey treatments and {{a significant decrease in}} sward above ground biomass was recorded under the dense treatment, compared with the open stand. In the same year, organic C and N, Mg and K concentrations as well as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi spore numbers were found significantly higher under sycamore than Scots pine plots in the 0 - 20 cm soil depth. The results show that, although understorey vegetation became uniform over time, the initial plant composition of the understorey treatments continued to affect tree growth, indicating the importance of the understorey vegetation at the establishment stage of silvopastoral systems.  However, as time passed initial tree spacing started to affect tree growth and tree species, particularly sycamore to improve soil properties. These results indicate an evolution of the initial <b>silvopastoral</b> <b>system</b> to a forest. </p...|$|E

40|$|<b>Silvopastoral</b> <b>systems</b> are {{a crucial}} part of the European {{cultural}} landscape and biocultural heritage. In Hungary, due to the intensification of agriculture and forestry management, silvopastoral practices were nearly totally abandoned during the last decades. In this paper, I review Hungarian ethnographic literature to discover the traditional silvopastoral management of Hungary. The papers were published in Hungarian, mainly in different ethnographic journals and in several books. In Hungary, until the passage of the Forest and Pastureland Separation Act (1853), forest grazing was a free right along with other silvopastoral methods, except pannage. Woodlands were natural shelters and sources of diverse fodder. Collecting leaf-fodder, leaf-litter, wild fruit and acorn were integral and common parts of traditional extensive livestock husbandry. The importance of <b>silvopastoral</b> <b>systems</b> increased during extreme weather conditions. All of them were controlled to avoid overuse and forest damage. Today, wood pasture management and illegal forest grazing is still alive, but the new forest law once again gives permission for regulated forest grazing in some cases. The openness towards silvopastoral managements is influenced by the new agroforestry innovations movement...|$|R
