40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether a multidimensional public-private partnership intervention, focussing on improving the quality and efficiency of <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> case management, reduced the <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> duration and the duration until self-support. Methods We used a difference-in-difference (DID) design with six intervention municipalities and 12 matched control municipalities in Denmark. The study sample comprised 282, 103 <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> spells exceeding four weeks. The intervention group with 110, 291 spells received the intervention, and the control group with 171, 812 spells received ordinary <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> case management. Using register data, we fitted Cox proportional hazard ratio models, estimating hazard ratios (HR) and confidence intervals (CI). Results We found no joint effect of the intervention on the <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> duration (HR 1. 02, CI 0. 97 – 1. 07) or the duration until self-support (HR 0. 99, CI 0. 96 – 1. 02). The effect varied among the six municipalities, with <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> HRs ranging from 0. 96 (CI 0. 93 – 1. 00) to 1. 13 (CI 1. 08 – 1. 18) and self-support HRs ranging from 0. 91 (CI 0. 82 – 1. 00) to 1. 11 (CI 1. 06 – 1. 17). Conclusions Compared to receiving ordinary <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> management the intervention had on average no effect on the <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> duration or duration until self-support. However, the effect varied considerably among the six municipalities possibly due to differences in the implementation or the complexity of the intervention...|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we ask whether the level of <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> {{provision}} protects the health of employees, particularly those who are most exposed to hazardous working conditions or who have a little education. The study uses the European Working Condition Survey that includes information on 20, 626 individuals from 28 countries. Health was measured by self-reported mental wellbeing and self-rated general health. Country-level <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> provision was constructed using spending data from Eurostat. Group-specific associations were fitted using cross-level interaction terms between <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> provision and physical and psychosocial working conditions respectively, {{as well as those}} with little education. The mental wellbeing of employees exposed to psychosocial job strain and physical hazards, or who had little education, was better in countries that offer more generous <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit.</b> These results were found in both men and women and were robust to the inclusion of GDP and country fixed effects. In the analyses of self-reported general health, few group-specific associations were found. This article concludes that generous <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> provision may strengthen employee's resilience against mental health risks at work and risks associated with little education. Consequently, in countries with a generous provision of <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit,</b> social inequalities in mental health are smaller...|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{outline the}} {{principles}} underlying changes overtime in entitlement to <b>sickness</b> absence <b>benefit</b> in Denmark. Methods The Danish <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> scheme {{during the past}} 30 years has been studied based on {{a comprehensive review of}} the <b>Sickness</b> <b>Benefit</b> Act from 1973, and all later amendments to the act. Results Entitlement to <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> in Denmark has undergone considerable changes during the past 30 years. The guiding principles of the reforms have been financial savings in combination with an assumption that human behaviour can be controlled through bureaucratic administration with focus on monitoring and evaluation. Conclusions The <b>Sickness</b> <b>Benefit</b> Act was initially based on a broad concept of disease but the implementation underwent major changes. In the 1970 s and 1980 s entitlement to benefit depended very much on medical diagnosis. This practice changed and today's policy is to some extent a return to the biopsychosocial approach {{in the sense that the}} citizen is not regarded a passive victim of disease but an active player in influencing own working capacity. Added to this is, however, a new element of much tighter control leaving less room for autonomy. ...|$|R

25|$|In 2015 the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) {{found that}} no savings {{had been made}} to date: the {{sickness}} benefit budget remained at more than £13billion a year. Furthermore, because many more claimants than forecast were being placed in the Support Group, the government's fiscal watchdog raised its estimate for spending on <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> by one billion pounds a year.|$|E
25|$|The {{main reason}} for this change in {{trajectory}} was demographic: in particular, World War Two 'baby boomers' on <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> had begun to draw their State Pension instead. Other specific reasons were: men suffering from industrial diseases, such as asbestosis and silicosis, caused by working in mines, shipyards and other hazardous environments, were dying prematurely; eligibility criteria had become stricter since 1995; and the economy had improved and was creating more jobs.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the prevalence and duration of <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> claims due to mental disorders and their association with economic activity, sex, age, work-relatedness and income replacement using a population-based study of <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> claims (> 15 days) due to mental disorders in Brazil carried out in 2008. The prevalence of mental disorders was 45. 1 claims per 10, 000 workers. Prevalence and duration of <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> claims due to mental disorder were higher and longer in workers aged over 40 years. Prevalence of claims was 73 % higher in women but duration of <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> claims was longer in men. Prevalence rates for claims differed widely according to economic activity, with sewage, residential care and programming and broadcasting activities showing the highest rates. Claims were deemed to be work-related in 8. 5 % of cases with mental disorder showing low work-relatedness in Brazil. A wide variation of prevalence and duration between age, economic activity and work-relatedness was observed, suggesting that working conditions are a more important factor in mental disorder work disability than previously assumed...|$|R

25|$|As a {{reflection}} of this failure of ESA to achieve its goal of shifting {{large numbers of people}} off benefits and into work, the cost to the Exchequer of out-of-work <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> did not fall at all after ESA was introduced: the annual cost is now predicted to rise to £14 billion or more in the course of 2016, largely because more people than anticipated have gone into the Support Group - particularly since the second half of 2013.|$|E

40|$|At {{the turn}} of the year 2009 / 2010 there was a change in the {{regulations}} on sickness impact. This led to 328 persons in County of Kronoberg had an expired period of <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> from the Social Insurance Office (Försäkringskassan) when they reached the maximum time for sickness or temporary disability compensation. These individuals were offered introductory programs with the employment services. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate how the population with expired period of <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> from the Regional Social Insurance Office in the County of Kronoberg (Försäkringskassan Kronoberg) is described in the initial stage, and to explore how individuals who achieved expired period of <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> from the Social Insurance Office (Försäkringskassan) talks about the meaning to get an expired period of <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> regarding economic and social issues. The study was inspired by Grounded theory. The method has consisted of both quantitative and qualitative interviews. In total, six persons participated in the surveys. Narrative method was used in the interview with a person with experience of an expired period of <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> from the Social Insurance Office (Försäkringskassan). The interviews indicate that the authorities have different focus on the concept of rehabilitation. This means that what is to be regarded as rehabilitation and the efforts which may benefit the individual depends on which authority has the power of definition. This study is made before preparing administrators for either statistics or working methods were established by the relevant authorities.

25|$|Substantial {{increases}} {{were made}} in social security benefits such as injury and <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits,</b> pensions, unemployment benefits, housing allowances, basic subsistence aid allowances, and family allowances and living allowances. In the government's first budget, <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> were increased by 9.3%, pensions for war widows by 25%, pensions for the war wounded by 16%, and retirement pensions by 5%. Numerically, pensions went up by 6.4% (1970), 5.5% (1971), 9.5% (1972), 11.4% (1973), and 11.2% (1974). Adjusted {{for changes in the}} annual price index, pensions went up in real terms by 3.1% (1970), 0.3% (1971), 3.9% (1972), 4.4% (1973), and 4.2% (1974). Between 1972 and 1974, the purchasing power of pensioners went up by 19%. In 1970, war pensions were increased by 16%. War victim’s pensions went up by 5.5% in January 1971, and by 6.3% in January 1972. By 1972, war pensions for orphans and parents had gone up by around 40%, and for widows by around 50%. Between 1970 and 1972, the “Landabgaberente” (land transfer pension) went up by 55%. Between 1969 and 1974, the average real standard rate of income support rose (in 1991 prices) from around 300 DM to around 400 DM. Between 1970 and 1974, unemployment benefits rose from around 300 euros to around 400 euros per month, and unemployment assistance from just under 200 euros per month to just under 400 euros per month. In 2001 prices, the average standard social assistance benefit level rose from around 200 euros per month in 1969 to over 250 euros per month in 1974. During most of Brandt’s years as chancellor, the majority of benefits increased as a percentage of average net earnings.|$|E
25|$|A law {{to improve}} the system of <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> {{provided}} that those insured would receive compensation when obliged {{to stay at home}} to care for a sick child and thereby incurring a loss of income. An insured person could request unpaid leave of absence on such occasions. The same law established the right to a home help, to be paid for by the health service, where the parents are in hospital or undergoing treatment, provided that the household included a child under 8 or a handicapped child required special care. The SPD-FDP coalition’s time in office also saw a considerable expansion in the number of childcare places for three- to six-year-old children, with the number of facilities rising from 17,493 in 1970 to 23,938 in 1980, and the number of places from 1,160,700 to 1,392,500 during that same period. Subsidies for day care rose between 1970 and 1980, but fell between 1980 and 1983.|$|E
25|$|One {{conclusion}} of Black's 2011 report concerned the <b>sickness</b> <b>benefits</b> system. Black felt {{that too many}} claims for the out-of-work sickness benefit Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) {{did not meet the}} threshold for eligibility, yet a Work Capability Assessment (WCA) only took place after an 'assessment phase' lasting at least 13 weeks (during which, the claimant is nominally paid ESA but, in practice, receives {{the same amount of money}} as they would if they were on Jobseekers Allowance). She was concerned that this phase might wrongly lead some patients to believe that they were too ill to work - because they were receiving 'assessment rate' ESA and because their GP had indicated that they were not fit for work on the medical certificate needed to initiate a claim - and that it represented a substantial delay in returning to work for those claimants who would later be judged able to work despite their chronic illness or disability; she therefore recommended that the assessment phase be abolished and that ESA only be considered after a WCA has taken place and the claimant has been found unfit for work.|$|E
50|$|In New Zealand {{income support}} exists {{for people with}} {{physical}} or mental health issues. The two main disability <b>benefits</b> are the <b>Sickness</b> <b>Benefit,</b> and the Invalid's Benefit. A doctor's referral and medical certificate (or equivalent) is needed to claim the benefits. The Invalid's Benefit is {{for someone who has}} a severe disability, and/or long term sickness, which is paid slightly more than the <b>Sickness</b> <b>Benefit.</b> In addition, there is the Disability Allowance, to supplement medical costs. If the Disability Allowance does not pay for all medical costs, then Temporary Additional Support is provided, but obtaining it is more difficult. All of these benefits have maximum limits, depending on such things as income (both the individual and their partner) and cash assets. Note that the <b>Sickness</b> <b>Benefit</b> and Invalid's Benefit are for people aged less than 65 but the Disability Allowance is for anyone over 18 years.|$|R
30|$|Having secured {{informed}} consent from participants, survey data {{were linked to}} the <b>sickness</b> and disability <b>benefit</b> register of the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration {{by the use of}} the unique 11 -digit national identity number.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{differences}} in sickness absence {{between men and}} women in Sweden have attracted a great deal of interest nationally in the media and among policymakers over a long period. The fact that women have much higher levels of sickness absence has been explained in various ways. These explanations are contextual and one of the theories points to the lack of gender equality as an explanation. In this study, we evaluate the impact of gender equality on health at organizational level. Gender equality is measured by an index ranking companies at organizational level; health is measured as days on <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit.</b> Methods Gender equality was measured using the Organizational Gender Gap Index or OGGI, which is constructed on the basis of six variables accessible in Swedish official registers. Each variable corresponds to a key word illustrating the interim objectives of the "National Plan for Gender Equality", implemented by the Swedish Parliament in 2006. Health is measured by a variable, days on <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit,</b> also accessible in the same registers. Results We found significant associations between company gender equality and days on <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit.</b> In gender - equal companies, the risk for days on <b>sickness</b> <b>benefit</b> was 1. 7 (95 % CI 1. 6 - 1. 8) higher than in gender - unequal companies.
