25|$|Key {{reasons of}} China's {{interest}} on Africa {{are to be}} found in China itself. Chinese economy, industry, energy and society have a <b>special</b> <b>shape.</b> Chinese economy and industry turn toward export markets. These industries and associated works and investment provide the Chinese society the recent two-digit yearly economic growth, job chances, and life standard improvement, but dramatically rely on coal (70%) and oil (25%) sources (for 2003), as well as raw materials. Notable are the frequent electric shortages. A US Congress hearing noticed that energy shortages have already led to rationing of the electric supply, slowing down manufacturing sector and consequently overall economic growth. On other raw materials side, China simply does not have enough natural resources of its own to meet its growing industrial need.|$|E
25|$|A {{persistent}} {{problem in}} the soft drinks industry {{was the lack of}} an effective sealing of the bottles. Carbonated drink bottles are under great pressure from the gas, so inventors tried to find the best way to prevent the carbon dioxide or bubbles from escaping. The bottles could also explode if the pressure was too great. Hiram Codd devised a patented bottling machine while working at a small mineral water works in the Caledonian Road, Islington, in London in 1870. His Codd-neck bottle was designed to enclose a marble and a rubber washer in the neck. The bottles were filled upside down, and pressure of the gas in the bottle forced the marble against the washer, sealing in the carbonation. The bottle was pinched into a <b>special</b> <b>shape</b> to provide a chamber into which the marble was pushed to open the bottle. This prevented the marble from blocking the neck as the drink was poured.|$|E
2500|$|The SSJ is {{very similar}} to the SJ version, but with close to [...] The only two {{examples}} built in 1935, the SSJ Speedsters sported a lightweight open-roadster body produced by Central Manufacturing Company, an Auburn subsidiary in Connersville, Indiana. One of them belonged to the actor Gary Cooper, the other one was lent by the company to actor Clark Gable, who already owned a Duesenberg J. The inscription SSJ (same goes for SJ) has never been officially used by the company, but it eventually became commonly used among the car lovers. The second [...] "S" [...] stands for [...] "short wheelbase" [...] as the two SSJ are the only Duesenberg to have a chassis with the wheelbase shortened to [...] The [...] straight eight engine of both SSJ models is equipped with two special carburetors and inlet ports of a <b>special</b> <b>shape</b> called [...] "ram's horn", which was used in other SJs as well. Unlike the normal port, the [...] "ram's horn" [...] is composed of two horns, with each of the two being split in two again. At the rear, the SSJ sported an external spare tire and smaller [...] "later-style" [...] round taillights. The external exhaust pipes sprouting out of the hood were an indication it was the [...] "supercharged" [...] version, but these were optional on J models as well.|$|E

Another set, ranging from the lion to the mouse, are quadrupeds. Go down {{a step or two}} further, and you come to insects with six legs--hexapods--a beautiful name, is it not? But beauty, in our sense of the word, seems to diminish as we go down: the creature becomes more--I won't say 'ugly' of any of God's creatures--more uncouth. And, when we take the microscope, and go a few steps lower still, we come upon animalculae, terribly uncouth, and with a terrible number of legs!" ...|$|E
6000|$|He was {{the sort}} of doctor that is in manners, in morals, in methods and appearance, most succinctly and finally {{expressed}} by the word [...] "rising." [...] He was large and fair, with a hard, alert, superficial, aluminium-coloured eye, and hair like chalk mud, even-featured and muscular about the clean-shaven mouth, erect in figure and energetic in movement, quick and spinning on the heel, and he wore long frock coats, black silk ties and plain gold studs and chains and his silk hats had a <b>special</b> <b>shape</b> and brim that made him look wiser and better than anybody. He looked as young or old as anybody grown up. And after that first wonderful outbreak he took to Bensington and Redwood and the Food of the Gods with such a convincing air of proprietorship, that at times, in spite of the testimony of the Press to the contrary, Bensington was disposed to regard him as the original inventor of the whole affair.|$|E
6000|$|In {{so short}} {{a book on}} so vast, complex and living a subject, it is {{impossible}} to drop even into the second rank of good authors, whose name is legion; but {{it is impossible to}} leave that considerable female force in fiction which has so largely made {{the very nature of the}} modern novel, without mentioning two names which almost brought that second rank up to the first rank. They were at utterly opposite poles. The one succeeded by being a much mellower and more Christian George Eliot; the other succeeded by being a much more mad and unchristian Emily Brontë. But Mrs. Oliphant and the author calling herself [...] "Ouida" [...] both forced themselves well within the frontier of fine literature. The Beleaguered City is literature in its highest sense; the other works of its author tend to fall into fiction in its best working sense. Mrs. Oliphant was infinitely saner in that city of ghosts than the cosmopolitan Ouida ever was in any of the cities of men. Mrs. Oliphant would never have dared to discover, either in heaven or hell, such a thing as a hairbrush with its back encrusted with diamonds. But though Ouida was violent and weak where Mrs. Oliphant might have been mild and strong, her own triumphs were her own. She had a real power of expressing the senses through her style; of conveying the very heat of blue skies or the bursting of palpable pomegranates. And just as Mrs. Oliphant transfused her more timid Victorian tales with a true and intense faith in the Christian mystery--so Ouida, with infinite fury and infinite confusion of thought, did fill her books with Byron and the remains of the French Revolution. In the track of such genius there has been quite an accumulation of true talent as in the children's tales of Mrs. Ewing, the historical tales of Miss Yonge, the tales of Mrs. Molesworth, and so on. On a general review I do not think I have been wrong in taking the female novelists first. I think they gave its <b>special</b> <b>shape,</b> its temporary twist, to the Victorian novel.|$|E
