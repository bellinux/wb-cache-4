40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of electrolytical hydrogenation on fracture toughness, corrosion crack-growth resistance and fracture micromechanisms of operated 12 Cr 1 MoV steel of {{thermal power plant}} <b>superheater</b> <b>collector</b> has been studied. Compact tension specimens were cut from perforated surface of thermal power plant <b>superheater</b> <b>collector</b> dismounted after 178, 500 hours of operation. Corrosion crack-growth resistance under tension of previously hydrogenated compact specimens with fatigue cracks was studied. Due to the increased concentration of hydrogen in solution an additional buffer was being created that prevents hydrogen leakage from the specimen through the fracture surface during the experiment. The hydrogenation causes the significant decrease of critical stress intensity factor Kc, during the experiment in 0. 1 N NaOH solution as compared with critical stress intensity factor K of non-hydrogenation 12 Cr 1 MoV steel obtained by the 5 % secant line method and in comparison with critical stress intensity factor Kc, determined through the J-integral. The areas of ductile crack growth in hydrogenated and non-hydrogenated specimens {{were found to have}} similar material fracture micromechanisms with dimples creation of different shape and size. But on the ductile crack growth area in hydrogenated specimens material intergranular fracture mechanisms were found caused by the hydrogen embrittlement which are similar to areas without ridges with the products corrosion traces...|$|E
40|$|The {{liberalization}} of the European energy markets {{combined with the}} rapid spread of unpredictable renewable energy sources have stressed the need of improving the traditional power units flexibility. Fast start-ups/shut downs and rapid load variations have become priority objectives because they guarantee high profits {{in the short term}} but cause a lifetime reduction due to thermo-mechanical fatigue, creep and corrosion. To this purpose, in the present work, an innovative procedure, able to predict the power plant dynamic behaviour during load variations, identify the most stressed components and estimate their lifetime reduction is presented and tested. Being combined cycles the most efficient, flexible and widespread technologies, the selected test case is a 380 MW combined cycle unit. To predict the plant dynamic performance a dynamic model has been built in Modelica language and several transient conditions investigated. The high pressure steam drum and superheater are the most stressed components. Results show a 52. 9 % reduction in <b>superheater</b> <b>collectors</b> life if the load variation is 50 % faster than the reference case. On the contrary, a 35. 8 % lifetime increase is observed if the load variation is 50 % slower. For the same conditions the high pressure steam drum life is reduced by 31. 9 % and increased by 16. 3 %, respectively. Also the superheater tube bank lifetime reduction is computed. The proposed procedure can be considered a valuable innovative tool to assist power plant designers and operators...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThermal {{power plants}} (TPPs) {{belong to the}} {{important}} objects, the failure of which can cause accidents with severe consequences. A large portion of Ukrainian TPP has exceeded its design life, which {{is determined by the}} main elements of steam power systems. Therefore, the main task is to assess correctly the superheaters collectors limit state using modern approaches and taking into account the service degradation of material. TPP superheater collectors operate in the steamy environment under the pressure of 15. 5 MPa at temperature 545 °C. As a result of combined action of prolonged thermo-mechanical stresses, corrosive and hydrogen environment and slow deformation, fatigue cracks emerge in these components on the inner collector surface. The limit state of boiler steam <b>superheater</b> <b>collector</b> model was assessed using failure assessment diagram (FAD). The FADs were built for Kmat = KIc and Kmat = Kfc taking into account safety factors for plastic collapse and for brittle fracture mechanisms for the collector model with part circumferential internal surface crack for various ratio of crack length l to depth a. The critical sizes of the inner surface defect, that is perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder, considering fracture toughness of 12 Cr 1 MoV steel for static and cyclic loading, were assessed. It was found out, that the increase of l/a ratio decreases the minimum crack depth that is critical for structural element...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe safe {{operation}} of thermal power plants (TPPs) is largely {{determined by the}} reliability of main components of steam systems of power units, to which belong the headers of boiler superheaters. The aim {{of the study is}} to estimate the residual lifetime of superheater header starting from the initial defect size and up to the maximum allowable one. The above-mentioned lifetime is affected by the fluctuations of temperature under steady mode of operation of TPP superheater header. Superheaters headers operate in a steamy environment under the pressure of 15. 5 MPa at temperature of 545 ºС. The header is a thick-walled cylinder made of 12 Cr 1 MoV steel with a length of 2314 mm, outer diameter of 325 mm and thickness of 50 mm. To estimate the residual lifetime of header, the registered operational data of steam temperature in header were used. The temperature range of header under quasi-stable operational mode was divided into three classes: the temperature range (1) T 30 °C. The local minima and maxima were determined using the obtained steam temperature history. The stresses in the wall of header for the given temperature fluctuations were calculated by finite element method (FEM). The residual durability was evaluated taking into account the effect of thermo-mechanical stresses and also the stresses caused by internal steam pressure. The stress intensity factors at the crack tip in the ligament between the holes of <b>superheater</b> <b>collector</b> were estimated by FEM. Based on the analysis of header defects, the proposed front shape was taken in the form of semi-ellipse. The crack growth at 500 ° C was modelled by Paris equation. With the increase of temperature difference between the external and internal header surfaces from 10 °С to 50 °С, the number of cycles, that is necessary for the crack to reach 35 mm in depth, decreases approximately in 25 times. It was calculated, that the average value of temperature fluctuations is 15 °С for the Class 1, and is 46. 2 °С for the Class 2. The lifetime of header can be extended due to the decrease of fluctuations of temperature range and their frequency...|$|E
