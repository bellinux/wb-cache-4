50|$|To Braverman, {{the proponents}} of {{capitalist}} methods of management have gradually realized the necessity to mask the degradation of skill in capitalist modes of production. During the initial implementations of Scientific Management, Taylor and others were more straightforward in their alienation and deskilling of workers, but recently have used more confusing methods to cover these mistreatments. One example is the addition to the already existing list of skill levels “unskilled” and “skilled,” the level “semi-skilled”. The criterion for a job that required a worker to be “semi-skilled” involved such operations as machine tending, machine feeding, machine operating - usually just operations with a connection to machinery. The scientific-technical revolution seemingly brought in an “upgrading” of skills. The 1968-1969 edition of the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Outlook Handbook described the requirements of a <b>semi-skilled</b> <b>worker</b> to include having normal physical characteristics of a person in fair health, being able to learn their duties {{in as little as}} a day and as long as a few months, being supervised closely, and repeating the same motions or jobs throughout a day of work. To Braverman this {{could just as easily have}} been a description of the requirements for an “unskilled” job.|$|E
40|$|To analyse {{the demand}} for unskilled and {{semi-skilled}} labour from 1993 till 1997, this article uses data of the IAB’s new Linked Employer-Employee data set (LIAB), which combines the IAB establishment panel with the historic data file of the employment statistics. The unskilled and <b>semi-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> are identified according to a job-oriented concept. The analyses confirm the postulated relationship between technological progress (as measured by the technical state of the equipment {{as well as by}} investment in IT) and a smaller proportion of unskilled and <b>semi-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> in companies. In contrast, a negative correlation between international interdependence (approximated by the export quota) and {{the demand for}} unskilled and <b>semi-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> could only partly be ascertained. Cross-sectional as well as longitudinal regressions show a negative relationship between the proportion of unskilled and <b>semi-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> in an establishment and the establishment’s average wage for unskilled and <b>semi-skilled</b> <b>workers.</b> For example, the estimated parameter from an OLS estimate implies that companies with a five per cent lower average wage for unskilled and <b>semi-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> have a one per cent higher proportion of unskilled and <b>semi-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> in their overall workforce. This therefore supports the thesis {{that one of the reasons}} for the increase in the unemployment rate of unskilled and <b>semi-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> is a too rigid wage structure which does not balance out the demand problems of unskilled and <b>semi-skilled</b> <b>workers</b> caused by technological progress.

40|$|Substantial {{research}} regarding {{skilled employee}} motivation exists, however {{the same degree}} of insight into what motivates semi-skilled workers, specifically through nonfinancial rewards, is sparse. Popular motivational theories postulate that financial rewards are the forerunner in motivating semi-skilled employees. While this may be true in certain circumstances, this approach can be costly and disregards the potential value semi-skilled workers might ascribe to non-financial rewards. This study aims to understand the value semi-skilled workers attribute to non-financial rewards. Given the limited amount of research related to <b>semi-skilled</b> <b>worker</b> motivation through non-financial rewards, an exploratory qualitative study was conducted to gain deep insights. 18 Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a total of 75 respondents acquired through non-probability sampling. Diversity was considered through the selection of three companies across three different industries of building retail, hotel, and contact centre services. Interviews were conducted at three employee levels of semiskilled workers, middle management, and senior management. The inclusion of management levels intended to understand differences in their perception of what motivates semi-skilled workers. This research uncovered that semi-skilled workers are chiefly motivated by non-financial rewards as opposed to financial rewards. Dominant non-financial motivators identified included customer satisfaction, interaction, and team spirit, while popular forms of demotivation included lack of work-life balance and poor management. The role of context became apparent with themes such as culture, industry, and individual differences emerging as reward preference influencers. Management misperceptions illustrated a shortfall in understanding what motivates semi-skilled workers. The study concludes with the presentation of the SCMAL motivation model as a recommendation for management seeking to increase <b>semi-skilled</b> <b>worker</b> loyalty and discretionary effort.

40|$|The {{number of}} western German women {{who wish to}} work has {{increased}} continuously since the mid-sixties irrespective of the economic development. In eastern Germany it remained {{at a high level}} in spite of continuously high unemployment. With the crisis on the labour market in the early nineties, however, it also became increasingly difficult for western German women to realise their wishes regarding employment, and in eastern Germany the competition on the labour market intensified {{at the expense of the}} women. The result was a stagnating labour force participation of women in western Germany compared with the 1980 s, with an increasing shift from full-time to part-time work, high unemployment, and the decline in the employment of women in eastern Germany almost to the level in western Germany. These are the results of a survey carried out by the IAB in 1995 which included 4, 059 women in western Germany and 2, 683 in eastern Germany. In addition it could be seen that the higher labour force participation of better qualified women which was ascertained as early as the 1980 s stabilised in all age groups in western Germany in the 1990 s. As a result of the above-average sudden drops in employment among women without a vocational qualification and among those with skilled or <b>semi-skilled</b> <b>worker</b> qualifications, the employment opportunities of eastern German women were even more strongly determined by the level of vocational qualifications. The consequence of this was that eastern German women from lower income groups, whose financial necessity to work is the highest, succeed less and less in finding employment again. With the improved basic legal conditions since the beginning of 1991, the number of women on childcare leave increased clearly, especially in western Germany. The 'voluntary' retreat from working life in this phase of life was, however, frequently of a temporary nature: the vast majority of western German women and virtually all eastern German women wished to return to work following the period of childcare leave. Whereas to a large extent western German women succeeded in returning to work after childcare leave, more than a quarter of the eastern German women who gave up work between 1990 and 1992 in order to care for children were unemployed or seeking work at the time of the survey. Women in western Germany also more frequently had possibilities to maintain contact to their company via part-time or temporary work during their childcare leave than did women in eastern Germany.

40|$|South Africa is {{currently}} confronting an HIV|AIDS crisis. HIV prevalence {{in the population}} {{is currently}} estimated at about 13 per cent with that number projected to increase {{over the next five}} years or so. Given the massive scale of the problem and the concentration of effects on adults of prime working age, the pandemic is expected to sharply influence a host of economic and non-economic variables. While the pandemic will certainly influence the rate of economic growth, structural changes are also likely to be one of the primary economic hallmarks of the AIDS pandemic. This paper builds on the work of Arndt and Lewis (2000) who estimated the aggregate macroeconomic impacts of the HIV|AIDS pandemic in South Africa using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) approach. They found that, despite dramatically lower rates of growth of the unskilled labor pool relative to the 'no AIDS' trend, estimated unemployment rates for unskilled labor in their base 'AIDS' scenario increased absolutely over most of the upcoming decade and are essentially the same (slightly higher in fact) as the rates estimated for a fictional 'no AIDS' scenario. In this paper, we seek to further investigate the interactions between unemployment and AIDS using the basic modeling approach set forth in Arndt and Lewis. Before projecting the impacts of the pandemic on unemployment, recently compiled historical data on employment, unemployment, and remuneration are presented. The unemployment problem is, rather, an employment problem; and it is concentrated primarily in the unskilled and semi-skilled labour category. Job creation performance over the past three decades in this category has been dismal with total employment (formal sector and informal sector) of unskilled and semi-skilled labourers in 1999 at only 92 per cent of the level present in 1970. In a country with an extraordinarily complex historical legacy such as South Africa, it is impossible to attribute this disastrous job creation performance to any single factor. Nevertheless, large differences in remuneration trends across labor classes and standard economic theory point to these trends as major contributing factors. By 1999, real remuneration per unskilled and <b>semi-skilled</b> <b>worker</b> had grown to 250 per cent of the 1970 level while remuneration for other categories had remained essentially flat. Based on these data, the neoclassical conclusion that unskilled and semi-skilled labor has been systematically pricing itself out of the market seems practically unavoidable. Employment growth has, given slow economic growth rates, gone hand in hand with wage moderation as in the highly skilled and skilled segments. In contrast, employment compression has been associated with substantial real remuneration growth as in the unskilled and semi-skilled segment. With this historical background in mind, we turn to examining the interactions between the AIDS pandemic and unemployment using a CGE approach. In the model, the unskilled and semi-skilled wage is fixed relative to the producer price index. As a result, employment levels by activity are the equilibrating variables. We find that, even though the pandemic is projected to drive growth rates in the supply of unskilled and semi-skilled labour to around zero, our analysis indicates that the pandemic will also depress labour demand leaving the unemployment rate, in our base 'AIDS' scenario, essentially unchanged compared with a fictional 'no AIDS' scenario. The pandemic depresses labour demand through three effects. Declines in the rate of overall economic growth. Pronounced declines in sectors that supply investment commodities, particularly the Construction and Equipment sectors. These two sectors happen to use unskilled and semi-skilled labour intensively and together account for a significant share (16. 3 per cent) of total payments to this category of labour. Beyond this investment demand effect (brought on by reduced savings), AIDS induced morbidity effects on unskilled and semi-skilled workers tend to depress output relatively more in sectors that use unskilled and semi-skilled labour intensively with further negative implications for employment. Countering these three effects will be key to palliating the negative economic consequences of the pandemic and reducing unemployment rates. To reduce the unemployment problem, South Africa must have rapid overall economic growth ideally with sectors that use unskilled and semi-skilled labour intensively leading the way. Results indicate that a policy of real wage moderation (or even modest decline) presents a straightforward option for bolstering overall economic growth. A wage moderation policy also provides a particularly large stimulus for sectors that use unskilled and semi-skilled labour intensively with further positive implications for employment.

For <b>semi-skilled</b> <b>workers,</b> the decline in the share of plants with recognised unions can account for almost 20 per cent of the coincident rise in earnings inequality.
