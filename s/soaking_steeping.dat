50|$|There are {{numerous}} non-pressure processes of treating wood which vary primarily in their procedure. The most common of these treatments involve {{the application of}} the preservative by means of brushing or spraying, dipping, <b>soaking,</b> <b>steeping</b> or by means of hot and cold bath. There is also a variety of additional methods involving charring, applying preservatives in bored holes, diffusion processes and sap displacement.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Six grain samples namely barley, maize, millet, rice, sorghum {{and wheat}} were tested for enzyme levels (amylase, {{protease}} and lipase) {{in order to}} assess their malting characteristics, using barley as a standard. The levels of the enzymes were estimated in the whole dry grains, 24 h steeped, 24 h sprouted and 48 h sprouted grains. A combined statistical analysis of linear regression and analysis of variance were used to test for enzyme interaction, similarities and interspecific relationship between the cereals. The estimated interspecific relationship between sorghum and barley was 84 % based on the three enzymes, while millet had 75 %. All the sprouted cereals {{with the exception of the}} standard barley had high lipase levels. This possibly suggests certain limitations as regards to production of off-flavours. Malt prepared from maize, sorghum, rice and millet had comparable protease levels with barley (P> 0. 05). The malts prepared from maize, millet, rice, sorghum and wheat had comparatively low alpha-amylase levels when compared with the standard barley. Multiple linear regressions showed amylase was dependent on lipase and protease. The relationship was not affected by either <b>soaking</b> (<b>steeping)</b> or sprouting of the grains. The implications of these findings suggest that a combination of these cereals might give good malt for food applications...|$|E
50|$|The grain {{was first}} <b>soaked</b> in a <b>steeping</b> pit or cistern {{for a day}} or more. This was {{constructed}} of brick or stone, and was sometimes lined with lead. It was rectangular and no more than 40 in deep. Soon after being covered with water, the grain began to swell and increase its bulk by 25 percent.|$|R
50|$|Generally {{recipes for}} pease pudding involve <b>steeping</b> <b>soaked</b> split yellow peas in stock (traditionally ham hock stock) and cooking them for around 40 minutes. The {{resulting}} mush is then blended with other ingredients, which {{depend on the}} variation. The oldest known written recipe for something similar to pease pudding involves saffron, nutmeg and a little cinnamon in the blending process; modern recipes sometimes beat in an egg {{at this point to}} act as an extra binding agent.|$|R
50|$|During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance period, ‘Iris green' (or 'Verdelis' and 'Vert d'iris'), was a rare, paint pigment colour used by {{manuscript}} illuminators and painters. It {{was made}} from the juice of the fresh flowers of Iris florentine and/or Iris germanica. The bluish or purplish petal juice was <b>steeped</b> (<b>soaked)</b> in boiling water, then combined and thickened with alum. It then produces a clear green paint. It {{was used in the}} 14th and 15th centuries. It can not be distinguished from 'sap green' (or 'verte de vessie' or 'verde di vesica') a paint juice derived from Buckthorn berries.|$|R
40|$|Solutions are {{presented}} for the material thermal response for heat shields of blunt probes entering Saturn and Uranus. Both monolithic and sandwich concepts were considered having exposed charring ablative or reflective materials. The solutions show that (1) Teflon heat shields are sized by mass loss considerations, other materials (unless entering the Uranus cold-dense atmosphere) by heat <b>soak</b> considerations, (2) <b>steeper</b> entries require less heat shield mass, (3) sizing requirements vary {{little about the}} bodies for heat soak dominated materials, and (4) carbon-phenolic appears superior overall, but silica is superior for the steeper entries and the high helium content atmospheres...|$|R
5000|$|John Winkler {{is among}} several popular Adirondack photographers {{of his time}} {{including}} Nathan Farb and Carl Heilman II. Winkler's books were different in that he focused on photos from off trail locations, mostly remote rocky outcrops, rock slides, streambeds, lakes and swamps. He carried a Canon SLR camera with 35 mm color slide film. Other popular photographers like Nathan Farb were known for carrying large format cameras that weighed a lot and inhibited distant travel. Winkler traveled light since much of the terrain he traveled in was extremely thick or steep. Traveling in high altitude spruce forests requires [...] "swimming" [...] through tangled stiff branches and a compass for navigation. John Winkler was {{a master of the}} map and compass, and integrated direct observation of the visible terrain to solve navigation problems. Doing 35 mm photography worked the best in sub-zero temperatures, cloud <b>soaked</b> forests, and <b>steep</b> wooded slopes. John used Sherpa Snowclaw snowshoes. He did not rock or ice climb but often navigated class 4 slopes in all seasons. He used the GPS briefly in the late 90s but eventually chose to move back to the magnetic compass.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the effects of soaking time (6, 12 and 24 hr) and steeping temperature (25, 30 and 35 oC) on germination time, germination percentage and weight loss of wheat and barley. Changes in chemical composition (such as protein, fat, and ash), reducing sugar content, enzyme activity and pasting profile and GABA (γ-animobutyric acid) content of germinated wheat and barley were also evaluated. The results clearly suggest that the short soaking time and lower steeping temperature significantly decreased germination time and weight loss, while germination percentage increased. Regarding the chemical composition, the protein content of wheat and barley was slightly increased after germination but {{there was no significant difference}} in content of crude fat and ash of both germinated cereals. The reducing sugar content of both germi-nated cereals decreased as the steeping temperature increased from 25 oC to 35 oC. Increasing <b>soaking</b> time and <b>steeping</b> temperature led to increased amylase activity, and also corresponded to reduced paste viscosity. The highest GABA content that occurred with soaking times of 6 and 12 hr and a steeping temperature of 35 oC was 1, 467. 74 and 1, 474. 70 µg/g for germinated wheat and 2, 108. 13 and 1, 691. 85 µg/g for germinated barley. This study indicated that the optimum germination process for wheat and barley is a low steeping temperature and a short soaking time...|$|R
