5|$|Anne <b>soon</b> <b>learned</b> {{that she}} would have no say in her son's care. James {{appointed}} as head of the nursery his former nurse Helen Little, who installed Henry in James' own oak cradle. Most distressingly for Anne, James insisted on placing Prince Henry in the custody of John Erskine, Earl of Mar at Stirling Castle, in keeping with Scottish royal tradition.|$|E
5|$|Nansen <b>soon</b> <b>learned</b> that no {{ship was}} likely to call at Godthaab until the {{following}} spring, though {{they were able to}} send letters back to Norway via a boat leaving Ivigtut at the end of October.

5|$|A warrant {{was sworn}} out for Waring's arrest, but {{officials}} <b>soon</b> <b>learned</b> {{that he was}} incapacitated, after being shot through both hips the day before Sharp's death. When Darby discovered that he was under suspicion, he began his own investigation into the murder. He traveled to Simpson County where he met Captain John F. Lowe, who told Darby that Beauchamp had related to him detailed plans for the assassination. He also furnished Darby with a letter that contained damaging admissions against Beauchamp.|$|E

5|$|Reaching Nemasket, Standish {{planned a}} night {{attack on the}} wigwam in which Corbitant was {{believed}} to be sleeping. That night, he and Hobbamock burst into the shelter, shouting for Corbitant. As frightened Pokanokets attempted to escape, Englishmen outside the wigwam fired their muskets, wounding a Pokanoket man and woman who were later taken to Plymouth to be treated. Standish <b>soon</b> <b>learned</b> that Corbitant had already fled the village and Tisquantum was unharmed.|$|E
5|$|On August 14, 1862, Cox {{began moving}} his Kanawha Division toward Washington as {{reinforcement}} for Major General John Pope's Army of Virginia. Exceptions to Cox's orders were the 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry and two regiments of Ohio infantry, which {{remained in the}} area for defensive purposes. The three regiments moved to Kanawha Falls in what is now south central West Virginia, {{at the beginning of the}} Kanawha River—which flows to the Ohio River. They were put under the command of Colonel Joseph Andrew Jackson Lightburn. Thus, the two battalions of 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry were reunited, with Colonel John C. Paxton commanding the cavalry regiment. Confederate leaders <b>soon</b> <b>learned</b> of the force reduction, and made plans to drive the Union army out of the Kanawha Valley.|$|E
5|$|The {{family was}} arrested and imprisoned, first in their home at Tsarskoye Selo and later at residences in Tobolsk and Yekaterinburg in Siberia. Maria {{attempted}} to befriend her guards both at Tsarskoye Selo and Tobolsk and <b>soon</b> <b>learned</b> their names and details about their wives and children. Unaware of her danger, she commented at Tobolsk {{that she would be}} happy to live there indefinitely if only she could take a walk outside without being guarded continuously. Still, she was aware that she was being watched constantly. Maria and her sister Anastasia burned their letters and diaries in April 1918 because they feared their possessions would be searched.|$|E

5|$|Wendell and Edith Willkie {{moved to}} New York in October 1929, only {{weeks before the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929, and found an {{apartment}} overlooking Central Park. Initially intimidated by the size and anonymity of the big city, Wendell Willkie <b>soon</b> <b>learned</b> to love it. He attended the Broadway theatre, and read through ten newspapers each day. Willkie {{and his wife had}} little in common, and grew apart through the 1930s. He acquired a social life, and met Irita Van Doren, the book review editor of the New York Herald Tribune who became a friend, and later his lover. Cultured, brilliant and well connected, Van Doren introduced him to new books, new ideas, and new circles of friends. Unlike Van Doren, Willkie was indiscreet about their relationship, and their affair was well known to the reporters covering him during his 1940 presidential campaign. None of them printed a word.|$|E
5|$|After a stay of six weeks, Hogg had {{to return}} to the conveyancer's office in York, and the Shelleys decided to {{accompany}} him back to his home in that city. In October 1811 Percy left for London to mediate in a dispute between his father and his uncle. Harriet remained with Hogg, who soon made further unsuccessful romantic advances towards her. Harriet's mother <b>soon</b> <b>learned</b> that Hogg and her daughter were living together, and sent Harriet's sister to stay with them. Harriet complained to Percy Shelley on his return about the way Hogg had treated her; Percy was offended, but nevertheless remained on friendly terms with Hogg. Troubled by the distress felt by his housemates, Percy Shelley suddenly decided to leave York with Harriet and her sister. Hogg subsequently sent him a series of angry letters in which he complained about how he had been treated. In his replies Shelley maintained that he still valued free love, but had left to calm Harriet. Hogg and Shelley subsequently exchanged many emotional letters {{over the course of the}} following two months, but then ceased communicating for a year.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1938, the Kingdom of Hungary, {{under the}} regency of Miklós Horthy, passed {{a series of}} anti-Jewish {{measures}} modeled on the so-called Nuremberg Race Laws enacted in Germany by the Nazis in 1935. Like their German counterparts, the Hungarian laws focused heavily on restricting Jews from certain professions, {{reducing the number of}} Jews in government and public service jobs, and prohibiting intermarriage. Because of this, Wallenberg's business associate, Kalman Lauer, found it increasingly difficult to travel to his native Hungary, which was moving still deeper into the German orbit, becoming a member of the Axis powers in November 1940 and later joining the Nazi-led invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. Out of necessity Wallenberg became Lauer's personal representative, traveling to Hungary to conduct business on Lauer's behalf and also to look in on members of Lauer's extended family who remained in Budapest. He <b>soon</b> <b>learned</b> to speak Hungarian, and from 1941 made increasingly frequent travels to Budapest. Within a year, Wallenberg was a joint owner and the International Director of the company. In this capacity Wallenberg also made several business trips to Germany and Occupied-France {{during the early years of}} World War II. It was during these trips that Wallenberg was able to closely observe the Nazis' bureaucratic and administrative methods, knowledge which would prove quite valuable to him later.|$|E

5|$|Alomar {{made her}} {{first and only}} {{appearance}} in Resident Evil 5. According to the character's backstory, her parents {{died when she was}} eight years old in an apparent factory accident and she was taken in by her uncle. Eventually, Alomar ran away and was found by a truck driver who was part of a rebel militia group. She later joined the group and <b>soon</b> <b>learned</b> that the factory accident her parents had died in was actually a test of a bio-organic weapon (BOW) by the pharmaceutical company Umbrella Corporation. With the help of the local government, Umbrella destroyed Alomar's village and its inhabitants after the test was complete. When Alomar was 15, she was contacted by U.S. operatives to sabotage Umbrella's attempt to sell a BOW. With Alomar's help, the deal was stopped and she was offered a chance {{to start a new life}} in America. Alomar accepted, was speaking fluent English within months and enrolled at a university two years later. After graduation, her benefactor recruited her to join the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA). While Umbrella had dissolved years before this, Alomar's hatred of Umbrella and others like them led her to join. She was assigned to a unit for eight months of training, in which she excelled and was chosen to become an agent assigned to the BSAA's West African department. When BSAA agent Chris Redfield is sent to intercept a black market BOW sale in the fictional African country Kijuju, Alomar is assigned to be his partner and guide.|$|E

However, the rumours continued until at least September 1300.|$|E

25|$|Money Player. Politicians <b>soon</b> <b>learned</b> {{to respect}} her: she could drink, battle, cuss and connive {{with the best}} of them, outspend {{practically}} all of them. Uvalde's white-browed John Nance Garner became her great & good friend—in & out of smoke-filled rooms, they understood each other. She made quadrennial $25,000 donations to national campaigns, but know-how, not money, worked her up to national committeewoman.|$|E
25|$|Police also <b>soon</b> <b>learned</b> {{about the}} 2009 {{incident}} {{where she and}} Solomon had been arrested after leaving Sky in the car unattended. During the investigation both of them admitted to having left the children by themselves {{for long periods of}} time. Detectives would not confirm whether, according to some reports, Biryukova had done so during the lengthy mediation hearing the week before Sky went missing.|$|E
25|$|Shoplifting {{and similar}} crimes {{eventually}} landed Bunker in juvenile hall, most notably Preston Castle in Ione, California, {{where he became}} acquainted with hardened young criminals. Although young and small, he was intelligent, streetwise and extremely literate. He <b>soon</b> <b>learned</b> to hide his fear and embrace his dog-eat-dog surroundings. A long string of escapes, problems with the law and different institutions – including a mental hospital – followed.|$|E

25|$|Bourguiba, {{who thought}} the Destour and its {{leadership}} to be obstacles to his ambitions, decided to resign from the party on September 9. He <b>soon</b> <b>learned</b> from this experience. The success obtained thanks to popular violent uprisings shows the failure of Destourians' favorite methods, consisting of petitions and telegrams. Only violence by determined groups could lead the Residence {{to step back and}} negotiate political solutions. That would be his guideline until 1956.|$|E
25|$|One ambitious noble named Paul, {{who thought}} it would be an easy thing to take the throne from an old man who had shown so plainly {{that he did not want}} it, rose in rebellion.

Paul {{expected}} nothing less than to have his head stricken off, but Wamba simply ordered that it should be shaved.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1970s, de Hory again {{decided to try}} his hand at painting, hoping to exploit his new-found fame: this time, he would sell his own, {{original}} work. While he had gained some recognition {{in the art world}} he made little profit, and he <b>soon</b> <b>learned</b> that French authorities were attempting to extradite him to stand trial on fraud charges. This took quite some time, as Spain and France had no extradition treaty at that time.|$|E
