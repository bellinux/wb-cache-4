In the later story {{of the origin of}} Ayyappa, Shiva impregnates Mohini, who gives birth to Ayyappa. Another variant says that instead of a biological origin, Ayyappa sprang from Shiva's semen, which he ejaculated upon embracing Mohini. Ayyappa is referred to as Hariharaputra, [...] "the son of Vishnu (Hari) and Shiva (Hara)", and grows up to be a great hero. Another tale <b>says</b> <b>after</b> Surpanaka's destruction, Shiva wishes to see Mohini and mesmerized by her looks, has union with her resulting in the birth of Ayyapppa.|$|E

2500|$|Matches {{involving}} the two leading Sussex patrons Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, and Sir William Gage were first recorded in 1725.

Three matches are known to have been played and all were won by Kent. A contemporary report <b>says</b> <b>after</b> the third match that it was [...] "the third time this summer that the Kent men have been too expert for those of Sussex". In the 1729 season, a team led by Gage is believed to have achieved the sport's earliest known innings victory in a match against Kent. Gage's team was called [...] "Surrey, Sussex & Hampshire" [...] in one account, however, and so was not a Sussex team per se.In the context of the time, with cricket mostly confined to the south-eastern counties, the combined team was effectively a Rest of England side assembled to take on Kent, the strongest county.|$|E
