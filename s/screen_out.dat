5|$|The {{onset of}} World War II caused a massive {{upheaval}} in people's lives as military mobilization engaged millions of men. Women were also {{accepted into the}} military in the U.S. Women's Army Corps (WACs) and U.S. Navy's Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES). Unlike processes to <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> male homosexuals, which had been in place since the creation of the American military, there were no methods to identify or screen for lesbians; they were put into place gradually during World War II. Despite common attitudes regarding women's traditional roles in the 1930s, independent and masculine women were directly recruited by {{the military in the}} 1940s, and frailty discouraged.|$|E

This paper builds a multilevel filter extraction model by fusing the thought of statistics and language rule. Firstly, the extraction model <b>screening</b> <b>out</b> domain atomic concept set by using method of improved TF-IDF. We secondly build a space combination rule, <b>screening</b> <b>out</b> initial domain compound concept set. Ultimately we <b>screening</b> <b>out</b> finally domain compound concept set by using POS rules template matching via POS analysis. Experiments show that this method can effectively identify and extract domain compound concept and F-measure has reached 83. 9 %. ...|$|R

25|$|Another {{source of}} {{controversy}} {{is the relationship}} between smoking and sensory gating in schizophrenia. Nicotine may help improve auditory gating, the ability to <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> intrusive environmental sounds. This may help improve attention spans and reduce auditory hallucinations, allowing people with schizophrenia to perceive the environment more effectively and engage in smoother motor functions. However, research shows this effect alone cannot account for increased smoking rates.|$|E
25|$|The EEG {{has been}} used for many {{purposes}} besides the conventional uses of clinical diagnosis and conventional cognitive neuroscience. An early use was during World War II by the U.S. Army Air Corps to <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> pilots in danger of having seizures; long-term EEG recordings in epilepsy patients are still used today for seizure prediction. Neurofeedback remains an important extension, and in its most advanced form is also attempted as the basis of brain computer interfaces. The EEG is also used quite extensively in the field of neuromarketing. In recent years, researchers have relied on EEG to understand the neural basis of swallowing.|$|E

500|$|A [...] "sect filter", {{also known}} as a [...] "protective declaration" [...] (Schutzerklärung), is a {{document}} that requires prospective business partners or employees to acknowledge any association with a sect or new religious movement before entering a business or employment contract. Such sect filters, primarily used to <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> Scientologists, have been drafted by German government agencies for use by businesses. [...] "Sect commissioner's" [...] offices exist in Germany as part of regional or local government.|$|E
500|$|Shelters were {{established}} [...] due north, west {{and south of}} the tower, known as N-10,000, W-10,000 and S-10,000. Each had its own shelter chief: Robert Wilson at N-10,000, John Manley at W-10,000 and Frank Oppenheimer at S-10,000. Many other observers were around [...] away, and some others were scattered at different distances, some in more informal situations. Richard Feynman claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the goggles provided, relying on a truck windshield to <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> harmful ultraviolet wavelengths.|$|E
500|$|On 7 August 1944, Omaha was {{guarding}} the flank of a formation {{consisting of the}} US heavy cruisers [...] and , the battleship Nevada and the , bombarding Toulon, France. Omaha assisted in the bombardment firing 24 rounds. An enemy shore battery began firing on Omaha at 17:17, Quincy was able to lay a smoke <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> for her while she fired [...] rockets {{in an attempt to}} jam their radar. Again on 20 August, while she was supporting Nevada, she once again drew fire from the enemy as she was departing from the area with the shells splashing [...] off her stern and [...] off of her port quarter.|$|E

500|$|Feynman {{was working}} in the {{computing}} room when he was informed that Arline was dying. He borrowed Fuchs' car and drove to Albuquerque where he sat with her for hours until she died on June 16, 1945. He immersed himself in work on the project and was present at the Trinity nuclear test. Feynman claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the very dark glasses or welder's lenses provided, reasoning that it was safe to look through a truck windshield, as it would <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> the harmful ultraviolet radiation. On witnessing the blast, Feynman ducked towards the floor of his truck because of the immense brightness of the explosion, where he saw a temporary [...] "purple splotch" [...] afterimage of the event.|$|E
500|$|Liu Kang {{specializes in}} kicks, with his most common move being flying {{across the screen}} and connect with a kick to the opponent's torso. Another such move is the [...] "Bicycle Kick" [...] in which Liu Kang flies across the screen {{with a series of}} {{multiple}} kicks to the opponent's torso resembling pedaling a bicycle, hence the name. A different kind of his signature abilities is the [...] "Dragon Fire": with it Liu Kang sends a fiery flame {{in the shape of a}} Chinese dragon across the <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> of his hands at his opponent. After Mortal Kombat II, he gains the ability to perform this while crouching and in the air, same for Deception and Armageddon. The developers made Liu Kang immediately selectable in Mortal Kombat: Unchained, the PlayStation Portable port of Deception, as they noted that unlocking him in Deception had proved difficult.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early in}} March 2013, Qiao Xiaoyang, {{chairman}} of the Law Committee under the NPCSC, stated that Chief Executive candidates must be persons who love the country and love Hong Kong, who do not insist on confronting the central government. Observers stated that Qiao comment was to <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> candidates from the opposition pro-democracy camp. Qiao also mentioned that [...] "the nominating committee is in fact an organisation. The nomination of Chief Executive candidates by the nominating committee {{is a form of}} organisational nomination.|$|E

2500|$|The pan-democracy camp {{saw it as}} {{the method}} to <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> the {{opposition}} candidates as the pan-democrat candidates would not get a majority support from the nominating committee if its composition mirrors the existing Election Committee which dominated by pro-Beijing interests. The pan-democrat candidates were able to enter the Chief Executive elections by getting just one-eighth of the nomination threshold from the Election Committee. There were also some interpretations that an organisational nomination would be a breach of the Basic Law. The Democratic Party vowed to [...] "veto this revolting proposal." ...|$|E
2500|$|In many {{countries}} and cultures, {{it is the}} process that romantic relationships are developed and future spouses are found. Some people go on first dates to evaluate a person’s potential as a sexual partner. Often, people have dates arranged for them by their friends, or they meet the individual at work, a party, in class, in their community or online on a social media website or dating website. During the date, each participant can evaluate the compatibility of the other party and {{get the opportunity to}} <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> individuals who engage in behaviour that a person does not prefer.|$|E
2500|$|Admissions {{tries to}} <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> {{difficult}} people. According to Dunbar, many colleges are [...] "afraid of aggression." [...] He recommends avoiding [...] "harsh humor" [...] or signs of severe emotion, anger, or aggression. Admissions evaluators look for signals that might indicate a difficult person, such as nonconstructive or disrespectful criticisms of others, or evidence of substance abuse. Colleges try {{to weed out}} dependent people who either follow their parents too closely, or do only what the [...] "cool kids" [...] do. Dunbar advised that [...] "parental control of any kind, if detected, can be very damaging," [...] and advised that students should {{not appear to be}} controlled by parental whims.|$|E

2500|$|Though Breyer {{noted that}} he agrees with much of Souter’s analysis, he wrote that Souter’s {{constitutional}} standard does not give sufficient weight to the serious [...] "managerial and administrative concerns" [...] described by the majority. Souter’s proposed barrier would not <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> very many cases, because {{there are too many}} issues of public concern; further, the speech of a vast many public employees deals with wrongdoing, health, safety, and honesty, and such a rule would protect speech by an employee engaged in almost any public function. The problem with such wide coverage is that the standard enunciated by Souter would not avoid the judicial need [...] "to undertake the balance in the first place." ...|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} {{difference between the}} basis of Professor Janda's conclusions and the concerns of industry is the presumption of how easy, or not, {{it will be for}} the Minister receiving a complaint to determine if it is [...] "frivolous or vexatious". [...] Professor Janda states that [...] "the general requirement that a complaint appear to be reasonable on its face is nevertheless sufficiently stringent to allow the Minister in question efficiently to <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> complaints that are frivolous and vexatious", whereas industry representatives state that this will not be an easy determination, given that the complaints will likely relate to activities in remote areas and particularly if the complaint comes from an individual outside of Canada (in a developing country).|$|E
2500|$|Rainwater tanks {{may have}} a high (perceived) initial cost. However, many homes use small scale rain barrels to harvest minute {{quantities}} of water for landscaping/gardening applications {{rather than as a}} potable water surrogate. These small rain barrels, often recycled from food storage and transport barrels or, in some cases, whiskey and wine aging barrels, are often inexpensive. [...] There are also many low cost designs that use locally available materials and village level technologies for applications in developing countries where there are limited alternatives for potable drinking water. [...] While most are properly engineered to <b>screen</b> <b>out</b> mosquitoes, the lack of proper filtering or closed loop systems may create breeding grounds for larvae. With tanks used for drinking water, the user runs a health risk if maintenance is not carried out.|$|E
