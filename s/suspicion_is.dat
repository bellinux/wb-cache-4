5|$|After {{the end of}} the campaign, Galland {{claimed to}} be {{suffering}} from rheumatism and therefore unfit for flying in open-cockpit aircraft, such as the Hs 123. He tactfully suggested a transfer to a single-engine aircraft type with a closed cockpit would improve his condition. His request was accepted on medical grounds. Galland was removed from his post as a direct ground support pilot. Galland never explained whether open cockpits had caused the complaint or some other cause; given his performance with eye specialists, a certain amount of <b>suspicion</b> <b>is</b> reasonable. He was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27—Fighter Wing 27) on 10 February 1940 as the adjutant, restricting him from flying.|$|E
5|$|Jerry {{inherits}} {{some old}} possessions {{of his grandfather}} Irving. Among them is a statue that looks just like one George's family had, until George broke it. Jerry promises that George can have it, but leaves it in his apartment for a few days. Kramer takes a few of Irving's old clothes, including a hat which he believes makes him look like Joe Friday of Dragnet. Elaine persuades Jerry to have his apartment cleaned by her client Rava's (Nurit Koppel) boyfriend Ray (Michael D. Conway). Jerry is very impressed {{by the quality of}} the cleaning; but when he and Elaine visit Rava, Jerry notices a statue with a vivid similarity to the one he inherited, and believes Ray stole it. He calls Kramer to check his apartment, and when Kramer cannot find the statue there, Jerry’s <b>suspicion</b> <b>is</b> confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Cameron (Eric Stonestreet) {{suspects}} Mitchell's new assistant, Broderick (Jeremy Rowley), has a {{crush on}} Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), which he denies but secretly affirms. His <b>suspicion</b> <b>is</b> soon proven wrong when Broderick hugs Cameron in an elevator revealing {{that he is the}} real object of his desire. While eating dinner together, Cameron reveals this to Mitchell, who still believes Broderick has {{a crush on}} him. To see which one is right, the two go to Broderick's house, but after getting a text from Broderick which says he is quitting, the two decide it would be best if they never knew which one of them Broderick liked.|$|E

25|$|O'Donojú died of {{pleurisy}} on October 8, 1821. That being said, {{some historians}} suspect {{that he was}} poisoned by Iturbide. The <b>suspicion</b> <b>is</b> based on the declarations of Carlos María Bustamante, a parliamentarian and writer. O'Donoju's remains were interred with the honors of a viceroy in the vault of the Altar of Kings in the Cathedral of Mexico.|$|E
25|$|X-ray: Although {{traditional}} plain X-rays {{are limited}} {{in their ability to}} image soft tissues such as discs, muscles, and nerves, they are still used to confirm or exclude other possibilities such as tumors, infections, fractures, etc. In spite of these limitations, X-ray can still play a relatively inexpensive role in confirming the suspicion of the presence of a herniated disc. If a <b>suspicion</b> <b>is</b> thus strengthened, other methods may be used to provide final confirmation.|$|E
25|$|Surgical {{debridement}} (cutting away affected tissue) is {{the mainstay}} of treatment for necrotizing fasciitis. Early medical treatment is often presumptive; thus, antibiotics should be started {{as soon as this}} condition is suspected. Given the dangerous nature of the disease, a high index of <b>suspicion</b> <b>is</b> needed. Initial treatment often includes a combination of intravenous antibiotics including piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and clindamycin. Cultures are taken to determine appropriate antibiotic coverage, and antibiotics may be changed when culture results are obtained.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Suspicion</b> [...] <b>is</b> {{the title}} of an American {{television}} mystery drama series which aired on the NBC from 1957 through 1958. The executive producer of <b>Suspicion</b> <b>was</b> film director Alfred Hitchcock.|$|R

25|$|Any person aged 15 {{or above}} {{and is a}} holder of a Hong Kong Identity Card is {{required}} to have it with him at all times. There is no requirement that reasonable <b>suspicion</b> <b>is</b> needed if a police officer decides to demand the production of one's Identity Card, {{as long as the}} officer is in uniform or produces his appointment documentation. A police officer may arrest without warrant anyone who fails to produce his Identity Card. Failure to produce one's Identity Card is an offence punishable by a level 2 fine.|$|E
25|$|In mid-2013 police across China {{announced}} the arrests {{of hundreds of}} people accused of spreading false rumors online. Chinese authorities have said the crackdown is directed at abuses such as fraud, fakery, and slander. But the accusations against many of the arrested microbloggers have a political edge {{with many of the}} rumors called outrageously false by the government dealing with the sins of officials: corruption, venality, and sexual escapades. The <b>suspicion</b> <b>is</b> that the crackdown is intended to break up online networks of like-minded people whose ideas could challenge the Communist Party. Some of China's most popular microbloggers have been arrested. In September 2013 China’s highest court and prosecution office issued guidelines that define and outline penalties for publishing online rumors and slander. The rules give some protection to citizens who accuse officials of corruption, but they say that a slanderous message forwarded more than 500 times or read more than 5,000 times could result in up to three years in prison.|$|E
25|$|Nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhoea, {{abdominal}} cramps, and constipation {{are common}} side-effects of chemotherapeutic medications that kill fast-dividing cells. Malnutrition and dehydration can result {{when the patient}} does not eat or drink enough, or when the patient vomits frequently, because of gastrointestinal damage. This can result in rapid weight loss, or occasionally in weight gain, if the patient eats too much {{in an effort to}} allay nausea or heartburn. Weight gain can also be caused by some steroid medications. These side-effects can frequently be reduced or eliminated with antiemetic drugs. Self-care measures, such as eating frequent small meals and drinking clear liquids or ginger tea, are often recommended. In general, this is a temporary effect, and frequently resolves within a week of finishing treatment. However, a high index of <b>suspicion</b> <b>is</b> appropriate, since diarrhea and bloating are also symptoms of typhlitis, a very serious and potentially life-threatening medical emergency that requires immediate treatment.|$|E

25|$|The next affective {{emotion in}} this {{beginning}} stage is incompetence. Feeling incompetent can spring from multiple {{things in a}} relationship, but during {{the initial stages of}} infidelity a person can experience this on an increased level. Meaning, they begin to notice when their partner does not say thank you for simple things, or they overthink any change made by the unfaithful partner. This can lead to a suspicious partner feeling like they cannot please their significant other and begin to feel incompetent in the relationship. When someone is having incompetent feelings due to someone else’s actions they begin to resent them creating a build-up and eventually an affective emotion outburst over something small. The faithful partner is not normally aware that their <b>suspicion</b> <b>is</b> the reason they feel incompetent in the relationship, and do not expect to be so irritated by the change of simple things; making it an affective response in this stage of infidelity (Miller, 2017). These unanticipated emotions could lead to more and multiple responses such as this one within the future of the initial stage of infidelity.|$|E

The purpose of this extensive planning is not known to us." [...] It also stated: [...] "When we left on April 7, 1944 we heard that large convoys of Greek Jews were expected." [...] Miroslav Kárný argues that, long after the war was over, Vrba wanted to testify about the deportations {{out of a sense of}} longing, to force the world to face the magnitude of the Nazis' crimes. The <b>suspicion</b> <b>is</b> that this led to a degree of embellishment in later accounts. Kárný wrote in 1998: ...|$|E

500|$|The act or {{decision}} {{of a public}} authority is challengeable if it acted in bad faith, that is, it [...] "intentionally abused its power or was reckless {{as to whether it}} did so". Thus, the Singapore Court of Appeal held in Law Society of Singapore v. Tan Guat Neo Phyllis (2008) that the Attorney-General [...] "may not use his prosecutorial power in bad faith for an extraneous purpose". The applicant must adduce sufficient evidence to prove bad faith; mere <b>suspicion</b> <b>is</b> inadequate. The court will consider all the evidence as well as any explanation provided by the respondent, and an inference against the respondent can be drawn if no explanation is given. In the UK context, bad faith is seldom relied on as a ground of review as it is absent in most cases, or difficult to prove.|$|E
500|$|During the campaign, Missouri was {{involved}} in a friendly fire incident with the Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate [...] According to the official report, on 25 February, Jarretts Phalanx CIWS engaged the chaff fired by Missouri as a countermeasure against enemy missiles, and stray rounds from the firing struck Missouri, one penetrating through a bulkhead and becoming embedded in an interior passageway of the ship. Another round struck the ship on the forward funnel, passing completely through it. One sailor aboard Missouri was struck in the neck by flying shrapnel and suffered minor injuries. Those familiar with the incident are skeptical of this account, however, as Jarrett was reportedly over [...] away at the time and the characteristics of chaff are such that a Phalanx would not normally regard it as a threat and engage it. There is no dispute that the rounds that struck Missouri did come from Jarrett, and that it was an accident. The <b>suspicion</b> <b>is</b> that a Phalanx operator on Jarrett may have accidentally fired off a few rounds manually, although {{there is no evidence to}} support this.|$|E
500|$|At Joshua's apartment, they {{discover}} {{he has a}} twin brother Matthew and equipment used for a negative matter ring. Their investigation is cut short as {{they are forced to}} evacuate from a rigged bomb which destroys the apartment as they flee. Lee and Francis were unable to hear the bomb, but Olivia could, possibly indicating that she retains the enhanced hearing demonstrated in [...] "Night of Desirable Objects." [...] They travel to Matthew's home in the suburbs, meeting the brother, his wife, and their children. Matthew professes to no knowledge of the location of his brother. Olivia is suspicious of Matthew's behavior but does not explore further. Olivia's <b>suspicion</b> <b>is</b> shown to be correct as Matthew is revealed to have been the one trapped in the amber, having tried to come warn his brother about the quarantine. Joshua, having posed as Matthew for the last few years, was the one that freed him and spoke to Fringe. The brothers switch places again when Olivia requests a more detailed identity check from Matthew, which he passes successfully.|$|E

Competition at the larval stage is considered the most serious. Indeed, <b>suspicions</b> <b>are</b> mounting that introduced carp are having very large impacts {{on a number of}} native Murray-Darling fish species due to competition at the larval stage, and that these impacts have so far been underestimated.|$|R

2500|$|EG {{typically}} presents with {{a combination}} of chronic nonspecific GI symptoms which include abdominal pain, diarrhea, occasional nausea and vomiting, weight loss and abdominal distension. Approximately 80% have symptoms for several years; a high degree of clinical <b>suspicion</b> <b>is</b> often required to establish the diagnosis, as the disease is extremely rare. It doesn't come all of a sudden but takes about 3–4 years to develop depending upon the age of the patient. Occasionally, the disease may manifest itself as an acute abdomen or bowel obstruction.|$|E
2500|$|In {{one-third of}} {{patients}} with sporadic CJD, deposits of [...] "prion protein (scrapie)," [...] PrPSc, {{can be found in}} the skeletal muscle and/or the spleen. Diagnosis of vCJD can be supported by biopsy of the tonsils, which harbour significant amounts of PrPSc; however, biopsy of brain tissue is the definitive diagnostic test for all other forms of prion disease. Due to its invasiveness, biopsy will not be done if clinical <b>suspicion</b> <b>is</b> sufficiently high or low. A negative biopsy does not rule out CJD, since it may predominate in a specific part of the brain.|$|E
