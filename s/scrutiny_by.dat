5|$|Anderson {{left the}} Centralia area on September 27, pursued {{for the first}} time by Union forces {{equipped}} with artillery. Anderson evaded the pursuit, leading his men into ravines that the Union troops would not enter for fear of ambush. In the aftermath of the attacks, Union soldiers committed several revenge killings of Confederate-sympathizing civilians. They burned Rocheport to the ground on October 2; the town was under close <b>scrutiny</b> <b>by</b> Union forces, owing to the number of Confederate sympathizers there, but General Fisk maintained that the fire was accidental. Anderson watched the fire from nearby bluffs.|$|E
5|$|The four hijackers {{checked in}} for the flight between 07:03 and 07:39Eastern Time. At 07:03, Ghamdi checked in without any luggage while Nami checked in two bags. At 07:24, Haznawi checked in one bag and at 07:39, Jarrah checked in without any luggage. Haznawi was the only hijacker {{selected}} for extra <b>scrutiny</b> <b>by</b> the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS). His checked bag underwent extra screening for explosives, with no extra scrutiny required by CAPPS at the passenger-security checkpoint. None of the security checkpoint personnel reported anything unusual about the hijackers.|$|E
5|$|Those {{involved}} {{in the construction of}} taiko are usually considered part of the burakumin, a marginalized minority class in Japanese society, particularly those working with leather or animal skins. Prejudice against this class dates back to the Tokugawa period in terms of legal discrimination and treatment as social outcasts. Although official discrimination ended with the Tokugawa era, the burakumin have continued to face social discrimination, such as <b>scrutiny</b> <b>by</b> employers or in marriage arrangements. Drum makers have used their trade and success as a means to advocate for an end to discriminatory practices against their class.|$|E

5|$|The shorter {{list was}} re-published (without the Genealogies) by Peter Hume Brown in his Scotland before 1700, from Contemporary Documents in 1893 {{and for the}} first time the text was subject to <b>scrutiny</b> <b>by</b> a {{professional}} historian. Walter MacFarlane's text was published by the Scottish History Society in 1908 as part of his Geographical Collections. Eneas Mackay of Stirling included Description and Genealogies in tandem with Martin Martin's 1703 Description of the Western Islands of Scotland in a 1934 publication. R. W. Munro's 1961 re-publication includes the full text of the Sibbald manuscript (MS), a comparison with the shorter Balfour/Auld versions, the recovered text of Monro's description of the Council of the Isles at Finlaggan, George Buchanan's preface to Description in Rerum Scoticarum Historia and scholarly accompanying material.|$|E
5|$|According to Microsoft sources, BitLocker {{does not}} contain an {{intentionally}} built-in backdoor; without a backdoor {{there is no way}} for law enforcement to have a guaranteed passage to the data on the user's drives that is provided by Microsoft. In 2006 the UK Home Office expressed concern over the lack of a backdoor and tried entering into talks with Microsoft to get one introduced, although Microsoft developer Niels Ferguson and other Microsoft spokesmen state that they will not grant the wish to have one added. Microsoft engineers have said that FBI agents also put pressure on them in numerous meetings in order to add a backdoor, although no formal, written request was ever made; Microsoft engineers eventually suggested to the FBI that agents should look for the hard-copy of the key that the BitLocker program suggests its users to make. Although the AES encryption algorithm used in BitLocker is in the public domain, its implementation in BitLocker, as well as other components of the software, are proprietary; however, the code is available for <b>scrutiny</b> <b>by</b> Microsoft partners and enterprises, subject to a non-disclosure agreement.|$|E

25|$|Psychologists have {{sometimes}} refused to disclose tests and test data to courts {{when asked to}} do so by the parties citing ethical reasons; it is argued that such refusals may hinder full understanding of the process by the attorneys, and impede cross-examination of the experts.

25|$|The WHCD {{has been}} {{increasingly}} criticized {{as an example}} of the coziness between the White House press corps and the administration. The dinner typically includes a skit, either live or videotaped, by the sitting president in which he mocks himself, for the amusement of the press corps. The press corps, in turn, hobnobs with administration officials, even those who are unpopular and are not regularly cooperative with the press. Increasing <b>scrutiny</b> <b>by</b> bloggers has contributed to added public focus on this friendliness.|$|E

25|$|In January 2006, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Cabinet Office, Jim Murphy was the {{government}} minister responsible for introducing the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 in the House of Commons. The Act was very controversial, {{because of a}} perception {{that it is an}} Enabling Act substantially removing the ancient British constitutional restriction on the Executive introducing and altering laws without assent or <b>scrutiny</b> <b>by</b> Parliament. The Bill proved unpopular with MPs and the Green Party. However, the Bill received royal assent on 8 November 2006.|$|E
25|$|Over the 1980s, in {{the context}} of a more general review of the {{classification}} of angiosperms, the Liliaceae were subjected to more intense <b>scrutiny.</b> <b>By</b> the end of that decade, the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, the British Museum of Natural History and the Edinburgh Botanical Gardens formed a committee to examine the possibility of separating the family at least for the organization of their herbaria.

25|$|Böhm-Bawerk's {{critique}} of Marx's theories was put under intense <b>scrutiny</b> <b>by</b> Marxian economists, such as Nikolai Bukharin. In his Economic Theory of the Leisure Class (1927), Bukharin argued that Böhm-Bawerk's axiomatic assumptions of individual freedom in his subjectivist theories are fallacious in that economic phenomena {{can only be}} understood under the prism of a coherent, contextualised, and historical analysis of society, such as Marx's. By contrast, Austrian economists have regarded Böhm-Bawerk's {{critique of}} Marx as definitive. For example, Gottfried Haberler argued Böhm-Bawerk's thorough critique of Marx's economics was so devastating that as of the 1960s no Marxian scholar had conclusively refuted it.|$|E

Opponents include the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, (who question the constitutionality of creating race-based governments), libertarian activists, (who challenge the historical accuracy of any claims of injustice), and other Native Hawaiian sovereignty activists, (who feel the legislation would thwart their hopes for complete independence from the United States).|$|E

They therefore proposed that nuclear decay rates were accelerated by a factor of one billion during the Creation week and {{at the time of the}} Flood.
