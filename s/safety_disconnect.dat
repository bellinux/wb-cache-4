50|$|The {{disadvantages}} {{of the knife}} switch are the slow opening speed and {{the proximity of the}} operator to exposed live parts. Metal-enclosed <b>safety</b> <b>disconnect</b> switches are used for isolation of circuits in industrial power distribution. Sometimes spring-loaded auxiliary blades are fitted which momentarily carry the full current during opening, then quickly part to rapidly extinguish the arc.|$|E
50|$|The National Electric Code {{states that}} a safety/service {{disconnect}} must be installed {{within sight of}} serviceable equipment. The <b>safety</b> <b>disconnect</b> ensures the equipment can be isolated and there is less chance of someone turning the power back on if {{they can see the}} work going on. These safety disconnects usually have multiple places for locks so more than one person can work on equipment safely.|$|E
50|$|The Remington Model 51 uses an {{internal}} hammer and features a single-action trigger. A unique combination lever {{on the rear}} of the grip-frame acts as a safety, bolt hold-open device and bolt release. This is in addition to the grip safety, magazine <b>safety</b> <b>disconnect,</b> and relatively heavy trigger pull. The grips are held on with spring-tensioned studs rather than screws. Not a single screw is used in the entire pistol. Pedersen was greatly concerned with human engineering and developing a comfortable grip angle for his pistol while not sacrificing the slim profile. Field stripping the pistol is cumbersome but not overly complicated and is mastered with practice.|$|E

25|$|Plug and socket systems {{intended}} for high current, high voltage or polyphase industrial equipment, {{as well as}} additional contacts and larger contacts, may also include features to improve the security and safety of use. For example, a high-power plug may include a locking ring or twist-lock feature to prevent accidental disconnection in use. A socket may include a mechanical interlock that prevents insertion or removal of a plug unless the local <b>safety</b> <b>disconnecting</b> switch is open. Plugs may include special measures to contain an arc generated during disconnection.

40|$|Hospitalization {{significantly}} impacts {{the lives}} of older people, both physically and psychosocially. There is lack of observation studies that may provide an embodied understanding of older patients' experiences in its context. The aim of this single case study was to reach {{a deeper understanding of}} one older patient's lived experiences of hospitalization. The study followed a phenomenological embodied enquiry design and the qualitative observation method of shadowing was used. In April 2011, one older patient was shadowed for 7 days, 5 - 7 h per day. To facilitate understanding in the reader the experiences are first presented in a story and subsequently analyzed by means of the lifeworld framework. The findings show that hospitalization is experienced as ambiguous <b>safety,</b> <b>disconnected</b> time, the feeling of being partially involved, and the struggle to re-attune to the body...|$|R

5000|$|Removal of {{the safety}} ground {{connection}} on equipment can expose users to an increased danger of electric shock and may contradict wiring regulations. The <b>safety</b> ground is <b>disconnected</b> by an adaptor (cheater plug) in a power lead in which the ground conductor is deliberately disconnected, or by cutting a ground pin in the power plug. If a fault develops in any line-operated equipment, cable shields and equipment enclosures may become energized, creating an electric shock hazard. For example, the metal shell of a stage microphone or the strings of a guitar may become energized, creating a hazard to performers. [...] (See Leslie Harvey, John Rostill, Keith Relf) ...|$|R
40|$|When a {{power grid}} is overloaded, load {{shedding}} is a con-ventional way {{to combat the}} imbalance between supply and demand that may jeopardize the grid’s <b>safety.</b> How-ever, <b>disconnected</b> customers may be excessively incon-venienced or even endangered. With the emergence of demand-response based on cyber-enabled smart meters and appliances, customers may participate in solving the imbalance by curtailing their demands collabora-tively, such that no single customers will have to bear a disproportionate burden of reduced usage. However, compliance or commitment to curtailment requests by untrusted users is uncertain, which causes an important safety concern. This paper proposes a two-phase load management scheme that (i) gives customers a chance to curtail their demands and correct a grid’s undersupply {{when there are no}} immediate safety concerns, but (ii) falls back to conventional load shedding to ensure safety once the grid enters a vulnerable state. Extensive sim-ulations based on a 37 -bus electrical grid and traces of real electrical load demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme. In particular, if customers are, as expected, suf-ficiently committed to the load curtailment, overloads can be resolved in real time by collaborative and grace-ful usage degradation among them, thereby avoiding un-pleasant blackouts in existing practice...|$|R
50|$|The pistol has a {{small number}} of design issues. The {{standard}} trigger pull is heavy, especially for a single-action pistol. This disadvantage is a consequence of the Hi-Power's magazine <b>disconnect</b> <b>safety,</b> which was initially added to the model to meet the requirements of the French military in 1935. The standard Hi-Power magazine safety is connected to the trigger and is released by a plunger pressing {{on the surface of the}} magazine. This action of the plunger on the magazine adds tension to the trigger pull, and the required force to operate this feature adds resistance as well. This problem is often resolved by removing the magazine safety entirely, thus voiding the pistol's warranty, or by polishing the interface surfaces between the safety plunger and the magazine. After-market trigger springs with reduced tension are also available to improve the trigger pull.|$|R
5000|$|In all, over 720,000 Model 1873s were {{produced}} up until 1923. With {{a return to}} popularity due to the Cowboy Action Shooting game, '73 rifles and carbines of a high quality {{have been made in}} Italy by Uberti, encouraging a return to production under license from the Olin company in 2013, joining the Model 1892 and the Model 1894 being manufactured in Japan by the Miroku Corporation for FN/Browning. The new ten shot Model 1873 is only available with a 20" [...] round barrel chambered in [...]357 Magnum/.38 Special. Nearly faithful in design to the original, including the trigger <b>disconnect</b> <b>safety,</b> sliding dustcover, and a crescent-shaped buttplate, it incorporates two safety improvements: a firing pin block preventing it from moving forward unless the trigger is pulled, and a cartridge carrier modification to eject used casings away from the shooter.|$|R
5000|$|In 2013 Winchester {{brought back}} the Model 1873, {{manufactured}} under license from the Olin company by FN/Browning in the Kochi Prefecture of Japan by the Miroku Corporation. This marks the third of the classic Winchester rifle models to be reintroduced, the previous models being the Model 1892 and the Model 1894. The new 1873 model is available with a 20" [...] round barrel and chambered in [...]357 Magnum/.38 Special only. It is nearly identical in design to the originals including the trigger <b>disconnect</b> <b>safety,</b> sliding dustcover, and crescent-shaped buttplate, but with two notable exceptions. An additional safety mechanism, a firing pin block that prevents it from moving forward unless the trigger is pulled, was integrated, and the cartridge carrier was changed to eject used casings away from the shooter. The fixed, tubular magazine has a maximum capacity of ten rounds.|$|R
5000|$|Further {{arguments}} are that functionally without a magazine the firearm is useless {{except as a}} club. Without the disconnect feature, a gun owner or police officer who accidentally releases the magazine in a gunfight would {{still be able to}} fire the bullet in the chamber; if a magazine was lost or otherwise not available, then at least the gun could be chambered with a single round {{to be used as a}} single-shot firearm. A Pro variant of the Ruger LC9s was introduced in December 2014, without a magazine disconnect, as a backup gun for law enforcement officers. [...] "The absence of a magazine <b>disconnect</b> <b>safety</b> also is a benefit for tactical reloads that allow the user to engage a target with one round remaining in the chamber and the magazine out of the gun for reloading," [...] Ruger said. A tactical reload is the tactic of replacing a partially empty magazine with a fully loaded magazine in a situation where increased capacity might be needed.|$|R
50|$|The Thunder 380 has a light {{aluminum}} alloy frame that reduces weight for easier carry, yet the pistol still retains enough mass (weight) to help tame recoil. Due {{to the small}} frame, the pistol is very well suited for female firers, and males with smaller hands. The magazines, however are designed with an extra section of grip, so that all fingers of the firing hand are accommodated. The blowback, fixed-barrel design theoretically aids accuracy, {{and it appears that}} the vast majority of Thunder 380 users report favorably on that issue. The nearly straight-in alignment of the chamber and the topmost cartridge in the magazine seems to be responsible for the pistol's reliable chambering and cycling. The frame features a long rearward tang over the grips, which effectively protects the shooter's thumb web from hammer-bite or slide-bite. There are several safety features built into the Thunder 380: a slide mounted manual safety and decocker that blocks the hammer, a magazine <b>disconnect</b> <b>safety</b> that prevents firing if a magazine is not inserted, a long double-action (DA) first trigger pull, an inertial firing pin, and (in some models) an integral key-operated trigger lock.
