5000|$|... ¡Megaton <b>Shotblast!</b> is {{the debut}} album by De Facto. Largely instrumental, the album pulls {{influence}} from various genres, including electronica, dub, reggae, and jazz.|$|E
5000|$|How Do You Dub? You Fight for Dub. You Plug Dub In. is {{the second}} EP by De Facto. It was {{released}} on Restart Records, a record label founded by Jim Ward, Paul Hinojos and Silas Carter, soon after Megaton <b>Shotblast.</b> How Do You Dub? is a repackaged version of the band's eponymous debut release which came out in 1999 as a very limited vinyl pressing. It features a different track order as well as replaces [...] "Drop" [...] with a new track [...] "Nux Vomica/Coaxialreturn" [...] (the only one to feature contributions from keyboardist Ikey Owens).|$|E
50|$|Following the {{break-up}} of At the Drive-in in 2001 Omar and Cedric switched {{their focus on}} De Facto. That year eventually saw all the band's releases come out, starting with 456132015 EP produced by Mario Caldato Jr. De Facto's first full-length album, ¡Megaton <b>Shotblast!</b> was released on the Gold Standard Laboratories label, and received moderate success, probably {{in part due to}} the popularity of At the Drive-In. Légende du Scorpion à Quatre Queues, which would be the last De Facto album, followed the same year, released through Modern City Records. Both albums combined band's studio recordings made in 2000 with live recordings from the European tour in 2001.|$|E
40|$|Thin overlays, diamond grinding, {{longitudinal}} grooving, transverse grooving, {{and milling}} {{have been successful}} techniques for restoring frictional properties on portland cement concrete (PCC) pavements. <b>Shotblasting</b> offers a lower cost alternative if successful. Five test sections of <b>shotblasting</b> were placed on IA 9 from Decorah east to the Winneshiek County line (milepost 260. 0 to 270. 0). Both smooth tire and ribbed tire friction testing (ASTM E 274) was performed. The conclusions and recommendations are: Based on the study, friction enhancement by <b>shotblasting</b> has a relatively short service life when measured by the ribbed tire test. However, when measured by the smooth tire test, the friction enhancement is longer lasting. Consideration of <b>shotblasting</b> for friction enhancement may be warranted to gain additional information, particularly when smooth tire friction properties are at issue...|$|R
40|$|Efficiency of the <b>shotblasting</b> process depends on: shot velocity, shot mass-flow distribution, and the shot-flow angle in {{the area}} being <b>shotblasted.</b> Using these three parameters, it is {{possible}} to predict the effect of <b>shotblasting,</b> and they can also be applied for estimating the efficiency of a <b>shotblasting</b> turbine. Shot mass-flow distribution measurement was performed using a multi-hole collector device. The particle stream was intercepted and the mass of shot particles collected in a particular hole of the collector was weighed and the partial mass-flow calculated by dividing the collected mass by the interception time. The shot-flow angle was measured by the application of a ladder-shaped obstacle placed in front of a piece of soft cardboard, which allowed the particle trajectories to be determined from the coordinates of the particular obstacle and its shadow on the cardboard. In order to measure shot velocity, a cross-correlation based velocity measurement system was developed which allowed the local shot velocity to be measured. Two different turbines were analyzed in this way. The obtained results are compared and discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study has}} been performed in order to optimize the operational characteristics of <b>shotblasting</b> turbine used for surface cleaning of metal products in foundries. The {{study has been}} focused on four main parameters: shot velocity, shot distribution, shot mass flow and turbine efficiency. Different turbine designs were experimentally studied which enabled the influence factors to be identified and then quantified by means of comparison of original and modified turbine characteristics. The step-by-step optimization was then performed which resulted in redesigned <b>shotblasting</b> turbine with improved operational characteristics. Up to 35 % higher maximum massflow rate of shot particles has been achieved and turbine efficiency has been improved by more than 6 %. Just slight reduction of shot flow velocity was observed (only 2 %), which confirms an important improvement of <b>shotblasting</b> potentials of new turbine...|$|R
40|$|The Iowa {{road system}} has {{approximately}} 13, 000 miles of Portland Cement Concrete Pavements, {{many of which}} are reaching the stage where major rehabilitation is required. Age, greater than anticipated traffic, heavier loads and deterioration related to coarse aggregate in the original pavement are some of the reasons that these pavements have reached this level of distress. One method utilized to rehabilitate distressed or underdesigned PCC pavements is the thin bonded Portland Cement Concrete overlay. Since the introduction of thin bonded overlays on highway pavements in 1973, the concrete paving industry has made progress in reducing the construction costs of this rehabilitation technique. With the advent of the <b>shotblast</b> machine, surface preparation costs have decreased from over $ 4. 00 per square yard to most recently $ 1. 42 per square yard. Other construction costs, including placement, grouting and sawing, have also declined. With each project, knowledge and efficiency have improved...|$|E
40|$|The Health Hazard Evaluation Program {{received}} {{a request from}} a gray and ductile iron foundry. The employer was seeking guidance on noise control solutions for the molding, knockoff, grinding, and inspection areas. We visited the facility in April 2011 to discuss concerns with managers and employees; observe work activities and processes; measure employees' noise exposures, sound levels, and noise frequencies; and assess potential noise control options. Noise sources included striking metal with sledgehammers; cutting metal with chop saws; and smoothing metal edges with stationary abrasive stone grinders, hand-held pneumatic chisels and grinders, and <b>shotblast</b> tumblers. The foundry operated three shifts per day and had about 200 employees. Employees worked 10 -hour shifts. Noise levels in many work areas were very high (above 100 decibels). Metal-to-metal contact, grinders and saws, compressed air, and vibration caused most noise from equipment and shaker conveyors. All employees we monitored were exposed to noise above noise exposure limits, and some employees' noise exposures were above 100 decibels, A-weighted. Some employees did not insert their foam earplugs properly. We recommended the foundry install controls to reduce noise, implement a long-term plan to purchase new equipment that generates less noise, require employees working in areas where noise exposures are above 100 decibels, A-weighted to wear earplugs and earmuffs, and use National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommendations for evaluating employees' hearing tests. We recommended employees wear hearing protection properly and tell their doctor that they work in areas with high noise levels and about hearing problems they have.

40|$|Abrasive <b>shotblasting</b> {{particles}} {{and a high}} concentration of dust within the closed testing chamber make particle velocity measurement in a <b>shotblasting</b> machine very difficult. The application of non-obstructive optical methods is usually impossible. Robust shields protecting the sensors from abrasion have to be used for contacting velocity measurements and make direct application of capacitive or electrodynamic sensors usually applied in the correlation-based velocity measurements methods not possible. An alternative electronic measurement system has been developed. It has a simple construction and uses low cost elements which can be replaced very quickly and, therefore, no robust shields are necessary. This enables very good mobility and positioning of the sensor along both axis in a cross-section plane of a particle stream. The system has been tested along with a robust mechanical measuring device. The development, operation and application of mechanical and electronic particle velocity measurement system are described in this paper. Experimental results are presented, discussed and both methods are compared...|$|R
40|$|Different {{residual}} strenght profiles {{were measured}} by X-Ray diffraction in areas {{close to the}} sufrace of AISI-SAE 5160 H steel used in making crossbow springs. Different <b>shotblasting</b> conditions were used and an experimental design was developed for finding process conditions offering suitable Almen intensity and residual strength profile when compression was applied. The combination of variables was chosen which tended to present the most suitable results within the parameters used in making springs in the same conditions, cycle them and determine their behaviour in fatigue tests...|$|R
40|$|Air-fed {{blasting}} helmets {{are used}} in abrasive blasting operations to provide essential face, eye and respiratory protection. BS EN 271 : 1995 (equivalent to the European Standard EN 271 : 1997), the standard that deals {{with the construction of}} blasting helmets, addresses the above matters and also the problem of noise generated by the breathing air supply. However it has no requirements for manufacturers to measure or report the helmet’s ability to attenuate the very high levels of noise generated by the blasting process. The aim of the project was to develop a test method to measure the noise attenuation of <b>shotblasting</b> helmets. The method developed is an objective measurement, using a head and torso simulator (HATS), which provides a suitable means for helmet manufacturers to report their product’s ability to attenuate blasting noise. The results from this project showed that the HATS currently prescribed by BS EN 271 : 1995 can be used for measuring the noise attenuation of helmets against typical <b>shotblasting</b> noise. Using such a HATS in the proposed test method will give attenuation values that correlate well with those measured using human subjects. Therefore the HATS already used by manufacturers to show compliance of their product with BS EN 271 : 1995 could also be used to provide information on the helmet’s noise attenuation. Results from this project also showed that the same HATS can be used, in place of human subjects, to measure the air supply noise accordin...|$|R
25|$|During {{renovation}} by W.W. Martin of Ramsgate, {{the original}} cast iron panels were <b>shotblasted</b> and the teak window frames dipped and stripped. New public lavatories were installed. Interior glass screens {{could not be}} saved but were reproduced in clear and green glass. Side doors were opened to allow the seafront promenade to continue through the open-air centre of the building. The 1924 stage area was restored to original condition with screened windows looking out to sea, and the wooden cupolas rebuilt with additional copper panels on top. The building was reopened for entertainment on 3 July 1999, followed by the official opening on 8 October.|$|R
40|$|Existing {{concrete}} surfaces {{need to be}} roughened to {{a profile}} necessary to achieve mechanical interlock with repair material. Surface mechanical morphometry {{is based on the}} measurement of surface profile - profilometry - which can be extended to 3 D representation with surfometry by means of a stylus registering the profile. Profilometry and surfometry analysis were realized on concrete after different surface treatments (grinding, sandblasting, <b>shotblasting,</b> hand- and mechanical milling). The profile has been quantified by means of statistical and amplitude parameters calculated from the waviness (lower frequencies) and the roughness (higher frequencies) profiles of the surface. Bearing ratio and Abbott's curve observations are also very useful to characterise surface profiles. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{concrete}} surfaces have to {{be prepared}} before the application of a new layer. Different surface treatments (grinding, sandblasting, <b>shotblasting,</b> hand- and mechanical milling) have been performed {{and the quality of the}} preparation has been established on the base of three main parameters: surface roughness, superficial concrete microcracking and adhesion. Cracks have been systematically observed, in relation with surface treatment by means of Scanning Electron Microscope and Light Microscope. Finally, a repair mortar, with or without bond coat, has been applied on the concrete substrates and adhesion has been measured. Analysis of results clearly show the effect of roughness on adhesion in the case where no bond coat is used, the influence of the surface treatment on the waviness shape of the profile and the presence of microcracks in the near-to-surface layer, which is related to failure type.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the microstructural evolution within the interphase between a hardening overlay made of cement mortar and an existing concrete substrate. The substrate {{has been treated}} using four methods, due to which different surfaces were obtained: a raw surface, a surface formed after contact with the formwork, a grinded surface, and a <b>shotblasted</b> surface. Special focus {{is placed on the}} results of the microporosity within the interphase zone (IZ) using X-ray micro computed tomography (micro-CT). The microporosity profiles obtained from the micro-CT images have been used to assess the nature of the IZ between the hardening overlay and the existing concrete substrate. It has been shown that microporosity and the number of pores in the concrete within the IZ increases during the hardening time of an overlay made of cement mortar. It also depends on the applied surface treatment method. However, no significant changes in the microporosity of the existing concrete substrate have been noted...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{concrete}} surfaces {{need to be}} roughened to {{a profile}} necessary to achieve mechanical interlocking with any repair material. In this study, different surface treatments (e. g. grinding, sandblasting, <b>shotblasting,</b> hand- and mechanical milling) were performed {{and the quality of}} the preparation established on the basis of three main parameters: surface geometry, superficial concrete microcracking and adhesion. Surface geometry was characterised on the basis of the measurement of surface profile-profilometry-and the analysis of statistical and amplitude parameters calculated from the waviness (lower frequencies) and the roughness (higher frequencies) profiles of the surface. Investigations were also performed to assess the quality of the superficial zone of concrete and cracks were systematically observed in relation to surface treatment where both scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy were used for analysis. Finally, a repair mortar with or without bond coat, was applied to the concrete substrates in order to measure adhesion. Relationships clearly show the effect of roughness on adhesion in the case where no bond coat was used and also the influence of the power of the surface treatment on the waviness shape of the profile and the presence of microcracks in the near-surface layer related to failure type.

50|$|The Steeple Grange Light Railway's main {{locomotive}} is GB No 6061, which {{worked at}} a number of steel mills. This loco was built from an adapted design, which had a cab that ran in on rollers. However, this was requested to be left off. She has one 5HP motor, a three notch controller and a 24 cell, 48 volt battery, and was saved and first restored by Adrian Booth. Mr Booth who has written a book on Greenwood & Batley, which is very interesting but sadly out of print. The SGLR also owns Ladywash mine No.6, GB No 2493. This loco was built in 1953, and is a standard 3 ton, 10HP design, albeit much modified by Ladywash throughout her career. Spending all her life at Ladywash, she was the first locomotive to be bought by the SGLR. However, due to a lifetime of heavy abuse, the controller being removed and the cost of new batteries nothing was done to her. She was bought by a member, who eventually sold her to another member, who is currently restoring her. She is now off site, with the frame being <b>shotblasted</b> to remove about 20 years rust.|$|R
40|$|Incompressible {{turbulent}} {{fluid flow}} in aerodynamically rough channels is investigated using direct numerical simulations. A comprehensive database of simulation data for rough surfaces with different topographical properties {{has been developed}} for 17 industrially relevant rough surface samples. It includes numerous commonlyseen industrial rough surfaces such as concrete, graphite, carbon-carbon composite and ground, <b>shotblasted</b> and spark-eroded steel. Other surfaces such as cast, filed and gritblasted steel are also studied, along with replicas of ship propeller surfaces eroded by periods of service. The Reynolds number considered is Reτ = 180, for which the flow is in the transitionally rough regime. A study with variable δ/Sq ratio while keeping S + q constant, where Sq is the root mean squared roughness height, is conducted {{for one of the}} samples with the mean profiles showing convergence for δ/Sq >≈ 25. A Reynolds number dependence study is conducted for two of the samples with Reτ up to 720 showing a more complete range up to the fully rough flow regime, allowing the equivalent sandgrain roughness height, ks to be computed. A correlation based on the frontal and wetted roughness area is found to be superior to the surface skewness in predicting ∆U + based on the topographic surface parameters...|$|R
40|$|Most rough {{surfaces}} found in engineering applications are irregular and possess features on multiple length scales. In these respects they differ considerably from standard roughness models, such as arrays of cubes, used in most experiments and numerical simulations investigating turbulent flow over {{rough surfaces}}. Results from direct numerical simulations of turbulent channel flow at Ret = 180 over realistic representations of typical engineering rough surfaces {{are presented in}} this paper. The surface geometries are based on surface scans of four different materials: graphite, carbon-carbon composite, <b>shotblasted</b> and ground steel. The roughness function DU+ shows a strong dependence on the three-dimensional topography of the surfaces and is not solely determined by the physical roughness height. The dependence of the roughness function on various characteristic topological surface parameters has been tested. As expected, the roughness function increases with the surface skewness and the effective slope. It is {{also found that the}} roughness function decreases with increasing surface bearing index. The surface anisotropy and the texture direction of the surface with respect to the mean flow direction has an additional effect on the roughness function. Of the normal Reynolds stresses, only the streamwise stress shows a clear correlation to the degree of roughness of the surface. The spanwise and wall-normal stresses are largely unaffected by the degree of roughness and the roughness type outside the roughness sub-layer...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. One {{of basic}} {{elements}} of band bucket elevators is their drive. For determination of power drive {{it is necessary to}} conduct calculations on standard by methods, in what it is needed to expend enough time. One of project parameters is productivity of elevator. It is necessary to build parametric dependence of power drive of elevator on its design capacity that takes into account a type and descriptions of load, lifting height, standard sizes and parameters of buckets and tapes. Methodology. Using the method of hauling calculation of band buckets elevators, the parametric dependences of power drive of high-speed elevators are built with deep and shallow buckets from their productivity at fixed type of load and height of getting up. Findings. It is set {{on the basis of the}} built parametric dependences that the change function of a size of elevator power from design capacity (at fixed to the lifting height, load type, rate of tape movement) is piecewise and droningly increasing. The intervals of project values of productivity, which provide the permanent size of elevator power drive are certain in a general view. As the example of application of the recived results the construction process of power drive dependence from design capacity of elevator of <b>shotblasting</b> room, which is intended for transporting of the metallic shot using for consolidating of carriage springs, is considered. For concrete type of load and lifting height of such elevator graphic dependence of power drive on productivity was built. Originality. Parametric dependences of elevator power drive on its design capacity were first built, which take into account a type and physical and mechanical descriptions of load, lifting height, standard sizes and parameters of buckets and tapes. Practical value. The use of the built dependences enables in relation to rapid determination of approximate value of power drive of vertical high-speed elevators with deep and shallow buckets on the stage of planning and to execute the high-quality selection of its basic elements at concrete project descriptions: type of load, productivity, lifting height...|$|R
