5|$|While the CPC is {{probably}} the organization with most access to North Korea, writing about North Korea is tightly circumscribed. The few reports accessible {{to the general public}} are those about North Korean economic reforms. While Chinese analysts of North Korea tend to speak positively of North Korea in public, in official discussions they show much disdain for North Korea's economic system, the cult of personality which pervades society, the Kim family, the idea of hereditary succession in a socialist state, the <b>security</b> <b>state,</b> the use of scarce resources on the Korean People's Army and the general impoverishment of the North Korean people. There are those analysts who compare the current situation of North Korea with that of China during the Cultural Revolution. Over the years, the CPC has tried to persuade the Workers' Party of Korea (or WPK, North Korea's ruling party) to introduce economic reforms by showing them key economic infrastructure in China. For instance, in 2006 the CPC invited the WPK general secretary Kim Jong-il to Guandong province to showcase the success economic reforms have brought China. In general, the CPC considers the WPK and North Korea to be negative examples of a communist ruling party and socialist state.|$|E

25|$|On July 26, 2006, the Texas jury in her retrial {{found that}} Yates was {{not guilty by}} reason of insanity. She was {{consequently}} committed by the court to the North Texas State Hospital, Vernon Campus, a high-security mental health facility in Vernon, where she received medical treatment and was a roommate of Dena Schlosser, another woman who committed infanticide by killing her infant daughter.

25|$|On July 26, 2006, {{after three}} days of deliberations, Yates was found {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity, as defined by the state of Texas. She was {{thereafter}} committed to the North Texas State Hospital–Vernon Campus. In January 2007, she was moved to a low <b>security</b> <b>state</b> mental hospital in Kerrville. Although psychiatrists for both Texas' state prosecutors and her defense lawyers agreed that she was severely mentally ill with one of several psychotic diseases at the time she killed her children, the state of Texas asserted that she was by legal definition aware enough to judge her actions as right or wrong despite her mental defect. The prosecution further implied spousal revenge as motive for the killings, despite the conclusion of defense experts that there was no evidence to support such a motive. Although the original jury believed she was legally aware of her actions, they disagreed that her motive was spousal-revenge.|$|E

In Huron where they lived from 1944-1956, Lopez-De La Cruz worked in a lunch truck that served Braceros. Her cooking and {{services}} were popular with fieldworkers and community members. She worked in the truck, raised her children, {{and worked in the}} fields with her husband and children. It was during this time that Gary Soto says that Lopez became vocally aware of the injustices faced by farm workers. He noted that Lopez-De La Cruz observed Mexican Americans working in brutally hot conditions, foremen stealing and pocketing workers Social <b>security,</b> <b>state,</b> and federal taxes, company stores on farms charging on average 3 times more than stores in the city knowing that farm workers would only have easy access to the company store; as well as issues like the lack of access to higher education for children of farm workers and the unfair wage hierarchy between racial groups on the farms. In 1957 they moved to Parlier, CA.|$|E

500|$|Kowalski {{feels the}} {{isolation}} of the precogs ensures that they see their visions merely as facts, and removes them from having to justify them. The precogs' ignorance of the results of their visions prevents them from knowing the effectiveness of the program. He feels the PreCrime officers are thus more qualified to evaluate their efficacy [...] "than the precogs themselves." [...] In the December 2003 edition of the academic journal Film Criticism, scholar Mark Garrett Cooper moved past that point by asserting that not only have the precogs [...] "yet to fully understand" [...] their visions, but that the process by which the images are interpreted makes it so that no one individual could understand them without the use of the apparatus. The machinery is so effective and precise according to Cooper however, that the [...] "omnipresent system effectively makes capture more certain than the crime." [...] When the system targets Cruise, instead of fleeing, he remains in the vicinity in the belief that the system will, in its inexorable logic, correct itself. The apparatus is considered so infallible according to Cooper that Cruise knows once he is cleared by it, his life can immediately return to normal. In this respect, Cooper feels that [...] "far from indicting a <b>security</b> <b>state,</b> the film legitimates one." [...] Gareth Higgins argues that [...] "he government is playing God, using an all-seeing eye to prevent murder." ...|$|E
