In this paper, the statistical measures for characterizing the degree correlation in networks are investigated analytically. We give an exact proof of the consistency for the statistical measures, reveal the general linear relation in the degree correlation, which provide a simple and interesting perspective on {{the analysis of the}} degree correlation in complex networks. By using the general linear analysis, we investigate the perturbation of the degree correlation in complex networks caused by the addition of few nodes and the rich club. The results show that the assortativity of homogeneous networks such as the ER graphs is easily to be affected strongly by the simple structural changes, while it has only <b>slight</b> <b>variation</b> <b>for</b> heterogeneous networks with broad degree distribution such as the scale-free networks. Clearly, the homogeneous networks are more sensitive for the perturbation than the heterogeneous networks. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} simple but {{efficient}} scheme for colour image retrieval, based on statistical tests of hypothesis, namely test for equality of variance, test for equality of mean. The test for equality of variance is performed to test the similarity of the query and target images. If the images pass the test, then the test for equality of mean is performed on the same images to examine whether the two images have the same attributes / characteristics. If the query and target images pass the tests then it is inferred that the two images {{belong to the same}} class i. e. both the images are same; otherwise, it is assumed that the images belong to different classes i. e. both the images are different. The obtained test statistic values are indexed in ascending order and the image corresponding to the least value is identified as same / similar images. The proposed system is invariant for translation, scaling, and rotation, since the proposed system adjusts itself and treats either the query image or the target image is sample of other. The proposed scheme provides cent percent accuracy if the query and target images are same, whereas there is a <b>slight</b> <b>variation</b> <b>for</b> similar, transformed...|$|E

40|$|In this study, the vortex-induced {{vibrations}} of {{a cylinder}} near a rigid plane boundary {{in a steady}} flow are studied experimentally. The phenomenon of vortex-induced vibrations of the cylinder near the rigid plane boundary is reproduced in the flume. The vortex shedding frequency and mode are also measured by the methods of hot film velocimeter and hydrogen bubbles. A parametric study is carried out to investigate the influences of reduced velocity, gap-to-diameter ratio, stability parameter and mass ratio on the amplitude and frequency responses of the cylinder. Experimental results indicate: (1) the Strouhal number (St) is around 0. 2 for the stationary cylinder near a plane boundary in the sub-critical flow regime; (2) with increasing gap-to-diameter ratio (e 0 /D), the amplitude ratio (A/D) gets larger but frequency ratio (f/f n) has a <b>slight</b> <b>variation</b> <b>for</b> the case of larger values of e 0 /D (e 0 /D > 0. 66 in this study); (3) {{there is a clear}} difference of amplitude and frequency responses of the cylinder between the larger gap-to-diameter ratios (e 0 /D > 0. 66) and the smaller ones (e 0 /D < 0. 3); (4) the vibration of the cylinder is easier to occur and the range of vibration in terms of V r number becomes more extensive with decrease of the stability parameter, but the frequency response is affected slightly by the stability parameter; (5) with decreasing mass ratio, the width of the lock-in ranges in terms of V r and the frequency ratio (f/f n) become larger.

The objective of the article is to optimize the use of fixed-size FPGA resources (block multipliers and block RAMs). The discussions and conclusions are based on synthesis results for FPGAs. They try to suggest the best method to compute the previously mentioned fixed-point functions on a FPGA, given the input precision.

40|$|Expression of {{the gene}} cluster icaADBC is {{necessary}} for biofilm production in Staphylococcus epidermidis. The ica operon is negatively controlled by the repressor IcaR. Here, the crystal structure of IcaR was determined and the refined structure revealed a homodimer comprising entirely α-helices, typical of the tetracycline repressor protein family for gene regulations. The N-terminal domain contains a conserved helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif with some conformational variations, indicating flexibility in this region. The C-terminal domain shows a complementary surface charge distribution about the dyad axis, ideal for efficient and specific dimer formation. The results of the electrophoretic mobility shift assay and isothermal titration calorimetry suggested that a 28 bp core segment of the ica operator is implicated in the cooperative binding of two IcaR dimers {{on opposite sides of}} the duplex DNA. Computer modeling based on the known DNA-complex structure of QacR and site-specific mutagenesis experiments showed that direct protein–DNA interactions are mostly conserved, but with <b>slight</b> <b>variations</b> <b>for</b> recognizing the different sequences. By interfering with the binding of IcaR to DNA, aminoglycoside gentamicin and other antibiotics may activate the icaADBC genes and elicit biofilm production in S. epidermidis, and likely S. aureus, as a defense mechanism...|$|R

The only big change is in the last line - whereas the original calls to praise God for the miracles he performed, the Hebrew one praises the miracles and wonders performed by the Maccabees.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{undergraduate}} course on concurrent programming where formal models {{are used in}} different stages of the learning process. The main practical difference with other approaches {{lies in the fact}} that the ability to develop correct concurrent software relies on a systematic transformation of formal models of inter-process interaction (so called shared resources), rather than on the specific constructs of some programming language. Using a resource-centric rather than a language-centric approach has some benefits for both teachers and students. Besides the obvious advantage of being independent of the programming language, the models help in the early validation of concurrent software design, provide students and teachers with a lingua franca that greatly simplifies communication at the classroom and during supervision, and help in the automatic generation of tests for the practical assignments. This method has been in use, with <b>slight</b> <b>variations,</b> <b>for</b> some 15 years, surviving changes in the programming language and course length.
