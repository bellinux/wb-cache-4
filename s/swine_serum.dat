40|$|Salmonella Typhimurium is an {{important}} agent isolated from cases of human food poisoning in Brazil. Animal-origin products are {{the main source of}} infection, and pork has been implicated in Salmonella transmission to humans. Programs to salmonella monitoring in swine have been carried out, using bacteriologicaland serological tests like ELISA. However, these tests are time-consuming and expensive. The rapid agglutination test (RAT) is cheaper, faster and easier. Aiming to standardize RAT to detect anti-salmonella antibodies in <b>swine</b> <b>serum,</b> 60 samples of <b>swine</b> <b>serum</b> were tested.

40|$|Certain {{interesting}} facts {{have been}} obtained regarding the action of normal <b>swine</b> <b>serum,</b> but {{in the light of}} present knowledge {{it is not easy to}} interpret them. It has been found that the normal serum possesses the property of protecting mice from infection with virulent pneumococci, and of agglutinating virulent S pneumococi and also avirulent R pneumococci. The protective action of the serum is specific, that is, absorption of the serum with pneumococci of one type removes or destroys only the property of the serum which is responsible for its protective action against pneumococci of that particular type, leaving the serum still active against pneumococci of other types. In this particular, therefore, the <b>swine</b> <b>serum</b> resembles a polyvalent antipneumococcus serum produced by artificial immunization. In other particulars, however, the <b>swine</b> <b>serum</b> differs from that produced byartificialimmunization. Inthefirstplace, theprotectiveaction exhibited by normal <b>swine</b> <b>serum</b> against type-specific pneumococci is very slight compared with that of animals which have been artificially immunized, even though the latter have received only a very few injections of the specific antigen. Moreover, the protective properties of the <b>swine</b> <b>serum</b> are destroyed by heating to 65 °C., and they disappear after a few weeks, even if the serum is kept in the cold. Also the protective action of the serum is diminished after the serum has been mixed with non-type-specific avirulent R pneumococci and the latter have been removed by centrifugalization. A further difference between the action of <b>swine</b> <b>serum</b> and that of the antipneumococcus serum produced by artificial immunization is that although the <b>swine</b> <b>serum</b> is type-specific in its action in protecting mice, nevertheless when this serum is mixed with a purified type-specific polysaccharide, neither precipitation nor fixation of complement results; and, finally, the action of the serum in protecting mice against pneumococci of a particular type is not inhibited by the addition of the homologous polysaccharide to the serum. These latter facts relating to the specific polysaccharide, and especially the fact that the specific protective action disappears after applying the so called absorption technique with non-type-specific organisms, are most difficult to harmonize with the present conceptions of the nature of pneumococcus type specificity. It is not proposed at the present time to offer any theoretical explanation of these phenomena. The studies have also confirmed the observations of Robertson and Sia, that, if a proper technique be employed, normal <b>swine</b> <b>serum</b> exhibits the property of agglutinating type-specific pneumococci, and that the agglutinins for pneumococci of one type may be specifically absorbed, leaving those for pneumococci of other types unchanged. Finally, it has been shown that <b>swine</b> <b>serum</b> causes the agglutination of avirulent R pneumococci. This property of the serum is not destroyed by heating at 65 °C., and therefore probably depends on factors other than those responsible for the agglutination of S pneumococci, and for the protective action of the serum in mice...|$|E
40|$|After {{infection}} of swine with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), {{there is a}} rapid rise of PRRSV-specific nonneutralizing antibodies (NNA), while neutralizing antibodies (NA) are detectable not sooner than 3 weeks later. To characterize neutralizing epitopes, we selected phages from a 12 -mer phage display library using anti-PRRSV neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb) ISU 25 -C 1. In addition, phages carrying peptides recognized by swine antibodies with high seroneutralizing titer were isolated after subtracting from the library those clones binding to <b>swine</b> anti-PRRSV <b>serum</b> with no neutralizing activity. Two epitopes located in the ectodomain of PRRSV GP 5 were identified. One of these epitopes, which we named epitope B, was recognized both by neutralizing MAb ISU 25 -C 1 and <b>swine</b> neutralizing <b>serum</b> (NS) but not by <b>swine</b> nonneutralizing <b>serum</b> (NNS), indicating {{that it is a}} neutralizing epitope. Epitope B is sequential, conserved among isolates, and not immunodominant. Antibodies directed against it are detected in serum late after infection. In contrast, the other epitope, which we named epitope A, is hypervariable and immunodominant. Antibodies against it appear early after infection with PRRSV. This epitope is recognized by swine NNA but is not recognized by either neutralizing MAb ISU 25 -C 1 or swine NA, indicating that it is not involved in PRRSV neutralization. During infection with PRRSV, epitope A may act as a decoy, eliciting most of the antibodies directed to GP 5 and delaying the induction of NA against epitope B for at least 3 weeks. These results are relevant to the design of vaccines against PRRSV...|$|R

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (1), normal standards of hemolytic complement activity of normal human serum were established by an accurate quantita-tive technique (2) and striking decreases were reported occurring during pneumococcus pneu-monia, during serum sickness, and after intra-venous type-specific antipneumococcus serum, but not after intravenous sulfonamide adminis-tration. The complement titrations were, {{in the majority}} of cases, performed within 48 hours of the time that the blood was collected, although a few specimens were titrated as long as 72 hours after collection. Probably because of its importance in many laboratory tests, the deterioration of complement activity of guinea pig serum has been more inten-sively studied than has that of humans. Nattan-Larrier and Grimard (3) studied the rate of deterioration of guinea pig complement activity at 5 °C., using 100 per cent hemolysis as the end-point. They found that the complement ac-tivity disappeared in 25 per cent of the specimens kept from 9 to 15 days. Pierret and Breton (4) found that guinea pig serum kept on ice lost 60 per cent of its complement-fixation power in 8 days and 90 per cent in 15 days.

The full-length genomic sequence of Shanghai swine isolate (SH-SW-zs 1) recovered from feces sample of a pig which was infected with HEV RNA positive <b>swine</b> <b>serum</b> was determined using RT-PCR and RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends) methods. The full genome of the SH-SW-zs 1 isolate was 7265 nucleotides in length and phylogenetic analysis indicated that this isolate belonged to genotype 4. Comparison of the 3 ' UTR sequence with the corresponding regions of other 38 HEV strains from different region revealed that the Shanghai swine isolate is 21 – 49 bp longer than the other stains...|$|E
40|$|Staphylococcus hyicus {{has caused}} great {{losses in the}} swine {{industry}} by inducing piglet exudative epidermitis (EE), sow mastitis, metritis, and other diseases and {{is a threat to}} human health. The pathogenesis of EE, sow mastitis, and metritis involves the interaction between the host and virulent protein factors of S. hyicus, however, the proteins that interact with the host, especially the host immune system, are unclear. In the present study, immunoproteomics was used to screen the immunogenic proteins of S. hyicus strain ZC- 4. The cellular and secreted proteins of S. hyicus strain ZC- 4 were obtained, separated by 2 D gel electrophoresis, and further analyzed by western blot with S. hyicus strain ZC- 4 -infected <b>swine</b> <b>serum.</b> Finally, 28 specific immunogenic proteins including 15 cellular proteins and 13 secreted proteins, 26 of which were novel immunogenic proteins from S. hyicus, were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. To further verify their immunogenicity, two representative proteins (acetate kinase [cellular] and enolase [secreted]) were chosen for expression, and the resultant recombinant proteins could react with S. hyicus ZC- 4 -infected <b>swine</b> <b>serum.</b> In mice, both acetate kinase and enolase activated the immune response by increasing G-CSF and MCP- 5 expression, and acetate kinase further activated the immune response by increasing IL- 12 expression. Enolase can confer better protection against S. hycius than acetate kinase in mice. For the first time to our knowledge, our results provide detailed descriptions of the cellular and secreted proteins of S. hyicus strain ZC- 4. These immunogenic proteins may contribute to investigation and elucidation of the pathogenesis of S. hyicus and provide new candidates for subunit vaccines in the future...|$|E
40|$|Porcine Proliferative Enteropathy (PPE) is {{a common}} disease of swine which {{is caused by the}} {{intracellular}} bacterium, Lawsonia intracellularis. The performance of a recently available commercial ELISA for L. intracellularis was evaluated by comparison with an immuno-peroxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) and found to have at least 97 % correlation. The same assay when conducted at different laboratories showed 100 % agreement in results. Examination of serum samples from various cases submitted to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic laboratory indicated that 87 % of the herds examined were sero-positive for L. intracellularis. Therefore, the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for Lawsonia intracellularis is a useful and reliable test which allows veterinary practitioners and producers to obtain same day results on <b>swine</b> <b>serum</b> samples submitted...|$|E
40|$|By {{means of}} {{complement}} fixation test the author conducted a comparative study on the reactivity of the serum of the rabbit immunized with bovine thymus nucleoprotein on different visceral extracts of bovine and swine, and obtained the following results. 1. Aqueous extract of bovine thymus nucleoprotein possesses antigenicity. 2. The grades of reactivity as observed in antigen-antibody dilution test about bovine thymus aqueous extract, bovine thymus nucleoprotein, swine thymus aqueous extract, and swine thymus nucleoprotein against the serum of the rabbit immunized with bovine thymus nucleoprotein are {{in the order of}} bovine thymus nncleoprotein=bovine thymns aqueous extract > swine thymus nucleoprotein > swine thymus aqueous extract. 3. Bovine thymus nucleoprotein was fractionated into nucleic acid and protein (histone) and the reactivity of the histone sulfate as the antigen was tested against the serun of the rabbit immunized with the bovine thymus nucleoprotein. It showes almost the same reactivity as that of nucleoprotein and thymus aqueous extract. No antigenicity of nucleic acid can be recognized. 4. In the study of the reactivities of 21 different visceral extracts in bovine and <b>swine</b> against the <b>serum</b> of the rabbit immunized with bovine thymus nucloprotein by means of the antigen dilution test, the reactivity are great in the following order in both bovine and swine: thymus extract, thymus nucleoprotein spleen, extract, testis extract, kidney extract and cerebellum extract...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In the pig, under-nutrition {{in utero}} causes low birth weight, a {{decrease}} in muscle fiber number, {{and a reduction in}} postnatal growth rate. Low protein intake during gestation and lactation has been demonstrated to increase the loss of body protein and to reduce the visceral organ mass of the newborn piglets. The effect of under-nutrition of pregnant <b>swine</b> on subsequent <b>serum</b> hormones characteristics of their offspring was investigated. The trial involved 16 pregnant MeiShan sows. The swine were allocated randomly to one of two groups: a treatment group (n= 8) and a control group (n= 8). During gestation and lactation, the diet of the treatment group was decreased to 50 % of their daily protein requirement. The control group was fed 100 % of their daily requirement to support the swine growth throughout gestation and lactation. All of swine were artificial insemination mated. Diets provided similar amounts of metabolizable energy. In this experiment, organ weights of piglets were reported as fresh weight (grams), scaled to empty body weight (EBW; grams per kilogram). Serum hormones of offspring were sampled at 0 d, 15 d and 35 d of lactation. Piglets were slaughtered at 0 d and 35 d of lactation for organ weight determination. The objectives of the current experiment were 1) to determine whether protein restriction alters levels of somatotropic hormones, insulin, insulin-like growth factor- 1, thyroid hormones, and 2) to evaluate the relationship between these eventua...|$|R
40|$|Inhalation of {{air-borne}} microorganisms {{and components}} thereof can cause illnesses and diseases. However, lack of specific and sensitive methods for exposure assessment can pose problems in predicting health outcomes. Characterization of microbial load from indoor environments using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and/or tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MSMS) {{as well as}} various bioassays (Limulus assay and in-vitro cell stimulation analysis using the A 549 cell line) {{was the focus of}} this thesis. GC-MS and GC-MSMS make use of the fact that microorganisms contain unique chemical structures that can be used as markers. Three chemical markers, namely, 3 -hydroxy fatty acids (3 -OH FAs; marker of LPS), muramic acid (MuAc; marker of peptidoglycan) and ergosterol (marker of fungi) were analyzed. The specificity of GC-MSMS was superior to GC-MS with regard to co-eluting compounds. The selective hydrolysis and extraction methods enabled simultaneous analysis of different markers from a single sample aliquot. The amounts of LPS present in house dust (calculated using 3 -OH FAs with chain lengths of 10 - 14 carbon atoms) and bioactivity (as measured by Limulus analysis) gave correlation coefficients (r) of 0. 60 and 0. 88. In a study involving exposure of human subjects to airborne material in a <b>swine</b> confinement building, <b>serum</b> IL- 6 correlated with 3 -OH FAs and MuAc (r= 0. 50 and r= 0. 46 respectively). MuAc also related with change in body temperature (r= 0. 57). In-vitro analysis using the cell line A 549 showed house dust to be a potent stimulant of IL- 8 and IL- 6 production by this cell line...|$|R
