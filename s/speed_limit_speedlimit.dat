30|$|The {{belief that}} others break <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> {{influences}} significantly driver attitude towards exceeding <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> and consequently any enforcement intensification {{could reduce the}} belief of others breaking <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> and will subsequently lead drivers to reduce the frequency of exceeding <b>speed</b> <b>limits.</b> In fact, others exceeding <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> is often used as a justification for driversâ€™ own behaviour and consequently, the less drivers exceed <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> the more each driver has no excuse to exceed <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> and may revise his behaviour.|$|R

50|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>limits</b> change {{depending}} {{on the time of}} the year; the maximum <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> on motorways is 120 km/h in the summer and 100 km/h in the winter.

50|$|Had Laju Kebangsaan (National <b>Speed</b> <b>Limits)</b> {{is a set}} of <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> {{applicable}} on Malaysian expressways, federal roads, state {{roads and}} municipal roads. The National <b>Speed</b> <b>Limits</b> was enforced on 1 February 1989 following the National <b>Speed</b> <b>Limit</b> Orders 1989 (Perintah Had Laju Kebangsaan 1989). Like any other countries in the world, failing to obey the <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> on Malaysian roads and expressways is an offence as subject to Malaysian Road Safety Act 1987, which can be fined up to RM300, depending on the difference between the <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> and the driven speed.|$|R

50|$|Ohio has {{an urban}} <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> of 65 mph on Interstates by state law, yet many urban areas have lower <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> due to safety {{concerns}} found in speed studies. These commonly {{are in the}} 50-60 mph range. For instance, in most of metro Dayton and Cincinnati, {{as well as in}} downtown Columbus, the <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> is 55 mph, while in Cleveland, Toledo, and Akron the <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> is 60 mph; however, in central Cleveland along the Inner Belt, the <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> is 50 mph. On one case, however, the Ohio Turnpike has a 70 mph in the outer suburbs of Toledo, Akron, and Cleveland, even since all 241 miles of the highway has the 70 mph <b>speed</b> <b>limit.</b> Some urban areas are also posted with minimum <b>speed</b> <b>limits,</b> usually with a minimum of 40 or 45. At one time, portions of Interstate 76 and Interstate 77 in downtown Akron had a maximum <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> of 50 mph and a minimum <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> of 35 mph.|$|R
5000|$|Normally, {{the end of}} a lowered <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> {{is marked}} with a sign reading [...] "State <b>Speed</b> <b>Limit</b> 55", {{indicating}} that the statewide <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> applies. In areas where a curve or other road condition makes the state <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> inadvisable, a sign reading [...] "End XX m.p.h. Limit" [...] may be used, with XX replaced with the <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> value. A [...] "State <b>Speed</b> <b>Limit</b> 55" [...] sign should be installed after the curve. This sign is sometimes misused in locations where the <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> changes to a speed other than 55 mph. This is mainly applied on both undivided and divided rural non-freeway routes. Though rarely seen, some divided roadways are set as low as 45 mph but mainly stay at the state <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> of 55 mph; in one exceptional case, that of the Scajaquada Expressway, the <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> was lowered to 30 mph in 2016 after a fatality.|$|R

50|$|In 2001, a bill {{allowing}} 75 mph <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> {{on roads}} in certain counties excluded trucks, introducing a 70 mph truck <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> on roads {{with a higher}} limit. A bill in 2005 allowing 80 mph <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> still excluded trucks. However, truck <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> were fully repealed in 2011.|$|R

50|$|The highest posted <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> in Oregon is 70 mph on I-84 east of The Dalles, I-82 and US 95. Oregon state {{statutes}} {{allow for}} a maximum <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> of 70 mph on rural interstate highways, and the law gives the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) discretion to define which freeway segments to post the 70 mph <b>speed</b> <b>limit.</b> ODOT did not raise <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> beyond 65 mph on other freeways, and strongly opposed legislative efforts to raise the maximum allowable <b>speed</b> <b>limit.</b> However, in July 2015, Governor Kate Brown signed a bill raising <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> on several highways in eastern Oregon; the bill included provisions to raise the <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> to 70 mph on I-84 and US 95.|$|R

50|$|A 70 mph <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> is {{only allowed}} on Minnesota's Interstates outside of urban areas.

40|$|The {{repeal of}} the National <b>Speed</b> <b>Limit</b> law in 1995 enabled {{individual}} states to set their own <b>speed</b> <b>limits.</b> <b>Speed</b> <b>limits</b> are necessary to ensure mobility while preserving highway safety. Any efforts to review existing <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> by states should be accompanied by evaluation of policy impacts such as safety and economic productivity. The goal {{of this research was}} to develop a framework for evaluating the impacts of <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> change in the State of Indiana and to use this framework to develop a set of <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> policy guidelines for the state. The study presents a state-of-the-practice review of <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> including a detailed literature review encompassing the impact of <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> changes on operating speeds and safety across the nation and in other countries. Historical trends in traffic speed in Indiana are reviewed and a detailed analysis of the impact of <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> changes on safety and productivity of the trucking industry in Indiana is presented. The study demonstrated that change in <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> in the past did have a statistically significant impact on operating speeds but was not the sole factor accounting for all variation. Statewide, fatal crash rates in Indiana showed no significant impact, and the rate for injury and total number of crashes actually declined after the <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> change. Positive and statistically significant impact on the productivity of the trucking industry in Indiana after the change in <b>speed</b> <b>limit</b> was reported. The study also presents a set of possible actions that may be considered for <b>speed</b> <b>limits</b> in Indiana. ...|$|R
