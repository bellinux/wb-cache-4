This [...] "wormy" [...] wood has since become fashionable for its rustic character. The American chestnut is not considered a particularly good patio shade tree because its droppings are prolific and a considerable nuisance. Catkins in the <b>spring,</b> spiny <b>nut</b> pods in the fall, and leaves in the early winter can all be a problem. These characteristics {{are more or less}} common to all shade trees, but perhaps not to the same degree as with the chestnut. The spiny seed pods are a particular nuisance when scattered over an area frequented by people.|$|R
50|$|In Japan in {{the late}} 1950s, Group Kyushu was an edgy, {{experimental}} and rambunctious art group. They ripped and burned canvasses, stapled corrugated cardboard, nails, <b>nuts,</b> <b>springs,</b> metal drill shavings, and burlap to their works, assembled all kinds of unwieldy junk assemblages, and were best known for covering much of their work in tar. They also occasionally covered their work in urine and excrement. They tried to bring art closer to everyday life, by incorporating objects from daily life into their work, and also by exhibiting and performing their work outside on the street for everyone to see.|$|R
40|$|The {{controlling}} behaviour of {{a vehicle}} {{is influenced by the}} performance of its steering system. The steering system consists of steering wheel, steering column, rack and pinion, steering gearbox, and a linkage system. The vehicle is controlled by the behaviour of the steering gear with the spring loaded rack and pinion. This spring loading arrangement consists of yoke <b>nut,</b> <b>spring,</b> and plunger. The plunger is always in contact with the rack, by the <b>spring</b> and yoke <b>nut.</b> The <b>spring</b> loading arrangement helps to eliminate the backlash between the rack and pinion, but increases the preload on the gear. This increases the torque required to rotate the steering wheel by the driver. In order to reduce this torque requirement, the spring loading can be reduced which in turn will increase the noise when the vehicle running on a bumpy road, and also may turn undesirably due to road disturbances. Hence, contradictory requirements to be fulfilled in the steering gear. This is done by providing an allowable preload on the spring. In practice, however, it will be desirable that the steering system is stiff while going on a straight road, and less stiff while turning at low speeds. This is accomplished by a Sensor-Actuator Based Smart Yoke for the rack and pinion steering system. In this arrangement, the sensor will sense the rack position. This sensor used here is a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). The sensor signal is captured by LabView software, and according to the sensor data, the software calculates a signal for the DC servo motor, that rotates the plunger causing the change in spring loading. The LabView signal is calculated based on an empirical formula obtained from a real torque data required in the rack and pinion steering system...|$|R
50|$|Group Kyushu (Kyūshū-ha) was an edgy, {{experimental}} and rambunctious art group {{that emerged in}} Japan in the late 1950s {{as part of a}} wave of young artists that would go on to change the look of Japanese modern art in the 1960s and 70s. Almost none of the members of Group Kysuhu were formally trained as artists, and hailing from the southernmost island of Japan (Kyūshū), they were remote from the center of haute culture, Tokyo. Reacting against what they saw as a stifling exhibition system that relied on personal connections and master-disciple relationships, they put great energy into fighting against the various institutions of the art establishment. The group worked in paint, sculpture and performance. They ripped and burned canvasses, stapled corrugated cardboard, nails, <b>nuts,</b> <b>springs,</b> metal drill shavings, and burlap to their works, assembled all kinds of unwieldy junk assemblages, and were best known for covering much of their work in tar. They also occasionally covered their work in urine and excrement, and have the dubious honor of being the first group to ever be forbidden from exhibiting at the famously permissive Yomiuri Independent exhibition (1949-63).|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Three {{distinct}} {{stages of}} flower cluster abscission were identified prior to fertilization: flowers {{which did not}} begin development (stage 1), flowers which had begun development (stage II) and clusters which had begun to form distinct nuts (stage III). Abscission of stages I and II coincided with a rapid increase in leaf area. Abscission of stage III coincided with the rapid increase in ovary growth. A localized dominance effect appeared to occur among buds located in close proximity. This became evident when multiple buds occurred at the same node or when numerous buds were borne on catkin peduncles. Both 'Ennis' and 'Barcelona' averaged over one nut cluster per node when multiple flower clusters were borne on a catkin peduncle. GA₃, 50 ppm, induced multiple budding at nodes. Developing female flowers were inhibited from maturing and abscissed. Male catkin development was also inhibited but to a lesser extent. Significantly greater numbers of female flowers differentiated in August on those branches treated the previous <b>spring</b> with GA₃. <b>Nuts</b> per cluster was increased with daminozide (2000 ppm), however, daminozide, TIBA (50 ppm) and boron (one pound actual boron per acre) reduced nut size. Daminozide, boron and TIBA did not influence the percent set at any treatment date. Ethephon (500 ppm), increased set. At all three treatment dates it increased percent set. The May 30 application increased set 18 percent above the control. There was no influence on set the year after treatment {{as a result of}} any of the sprays...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} to explore a {{composite}} type piezoelectric motor. Its main structures include the piezoelectric stator, rotor, the preload adjusting module and shaft. Wherein the piezoelectric stator is made base, the composite type actuating element and stator formed. As the composite type actuating element is set by the axial vibration type actuating element, horizontal bending vibration type actuating element and vertical bending vibration type actuating element formed. The stator is an empty cylinder with a waist and tapered hole. In addition, the rotor {{is a kind of}} a hollow cone. It can be through the preload adjusting module to withstand the stator. As the preload adjusting module is set by the limit element, <b>spring,</b> washer and <b>nut</b> formed. While the shaft is a kind of cylinder with screw thread and stopper, it can pass through the piezoelectric stator, rotor and the preload adjusting module, making it a composite type piezoelectric motor. When we provide appropriate driving voltage, frequency, loading and phase angle to the piezoelectric stator, we can let the piezoelectric motor produces rapid rotation. Of course, we can also change through the driving phase angle, to change the direction of rotation of the piezoelectric motor. According to the experimental results, we found that its maximum speed and loading are 480 rpm and 2305 gw under conditions of 180 V p-p, 35 kHz and 0 0 driving phase angle. Most importantly, we also found that the composite type piezoelectric motor has a very good conversion efficiency of the driving phase angle. </p...|$|R
40|$|Pinned element {{connections}} in aluminium trusses are investigated experimentally [2]. Forces in the connections are transferred through shear and bearing. Because the inner cylinder and the securing pins are conical, {{there is no}} play in the connection when it is assembled. Securing the pins with springs allows for fast assembly and disassembly. In practice also nuts are used for securing the pins. The parameters investigated in the research are the boundary conditions (hinged or fixed in clamps of the test bench) {{and the way the}} pins are secured (with <b>springs</b> or with <b>nuts).</b> The mean maximum load at structural failure is 136 kN. This load was not influenced by the parameters investigated. The maximum elongation at structural failure is influenced by the way the pins are secured. The use of nuts (series II) results in more elongation (sample mean 14. 7 mm) compared to the use of springs (series I, sample mean 13. 1 mm). The load at maximum elastic deformation is influenced by the boundary conditions in the test bench. The clamped specimens show a mean elastic load limit of 39. 7 kN, which is approximately 12 kN lower than the hinged specimens which show a mean elastic load limit of 51. 4 kN. This {{can be explained by the}} additional stresses in the fixed connections resulting from the prevention of rotations, leading to a lower limit for elastic loading. The elastic connection stiffness is dependent on the way the pins are secured. The stiffness using springs is 56. 9 kN/mm, which is considerably higher than the stiffness using nuts which is 39. 3 kN/mm...|$|R
