Walrus or bearded seal intestines were considered better materials for rain parkas than the intestines of small seals. In summer they were used as rain parkas and were as waterproof as garments made of intestine. The smoother inside of the gut would become {{the outside of the}} parka. Bear gut (taqukinraq sg taqukinraat pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik) parkas are said to last longer than seal gut (irnerrluk in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, irnerrlug in Cup'ig) parkas. The seal-gut material (qalirkaq in Yup'ik and Cup'ik), esp. baby bearded-seal gut (maklagaat qalirkait) were used for <b>smoke-hole</b> window.|$|E

60|$|There, {{standing}} in a beam of golden light that, passing through the <b>smoke-hole,</b> pierced the soft gloom of the hut, stood the most beautiful creature that I had ever seen--that is, if it be admitted {{that a person who}} is black, or rather copper-coloured, can be beautiful.|$|E
50|$|In {{the book}} It by Stephen King, {{the members of}} the losers club build a pit in their club, which they fill with green {{branches}} and set them on fire to create smoke. One of them talks about the ritual use of <b>smoke-holes</b> by Native Americans.|$|R
60|$|So {{very slowly}} and silently, by {{the help of}} the rimpis which bound the straw, she climbed the dome of the hut, {{laughing}} to herself to think that this was the worst of omens for its owner, till at length she reached the <b>smoke-hole</b> at the top and looked down.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{climb up}} there," [...] {{she said to}} herself, [...] "I can look down through the <b>smoke-hole</b> and see and hear what passes in the hut. Only then if the moon comes out again I may be seen lying on the thatch; well, that I must chance with the rest." ...|$|E
60|$|Listen! He {{was walking}} {{round and round}} the yard. He went to the bench beneath the tree and felt along it with his fingers {{to see if she}} were there. Now he was {{entering}} the hut and groping at the bedstead, and now he had kindled a light, for the rays of it shone faintly up through the <b>smoke-hole.</b> Discovering nothing he came out again, leaving the lamp burning within, and called her softly.|$|E
60|$|So {{the night}} wore away, till at length I woke {{to see the}} gleam of dawn {{penetrating}} the <b>smoke-hole</b> and dimly illuminating the recumbent form of Kaatje, which to me looked most unattractive. Presently I heard a discreet tapping on the doorboard of the hut which I at once removed, wriggling swiftly through the hole, careless in my misery as to whether I met an assegai {{the other side of}} it or not. Without a guard of eight soldiers was standing, and with them Goza, who asked me if I were ready to start.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, friend, you are unarmed," [...] {{she thought}} to herself, [...] "for you have no gun with you, and perhaps we shall settle our {{accounts}} {{before you go to}} seek that dead jackal by to-morrow's light." [...] Then drawing the assegai from the cloak and keeping it in her hand, she crept on till she came {{to the back of the}} hut in safety. Still she was not much nearer to her end, for the hut was new and very well built, and she could find no crack to look through, though when she placed her ear against its side she thought that she could hear the sound of a man's voice. In her perplexity Sihamba cast her eyes upwards and saw that a fine line of light shone from the <b>smoke-hole</b> at the very top of the hut, which was hive-shaped, and a thought came into her head.|$|E
6000|$|I {{went and}} {{examined}} the door for myself, for by now my sciatica, or whatever it may have been, was so much better that I could walk a little. What Hans said was true. There was the spider's web with the spider sitting in the middle. Also some of the threads of the web were fixed from post to post, {{so that it was}} impossible that the door could have been opened or, if opened, that anyone could have passed through the doorway without breaking them. Therefore, unless the woman came through one of the little window-places, which was almost incredible as they were high above the ground, or dropped from the <b>smoke-hole</b> in the roof, or had been shut into the place when the door was closed on the previous night, I could not see how she had arrived there. And if any one of these incredible suppositions was correct, then how did she get out again with two men watching her? ...|$|E
60|$|A {{hundred yards}} or so more and the {{catastrophe}} occurred. We had reached {{a spot in the}} forest where one of the great trees had fallen down, letting in a little light. I can see it to this hour. There lay the enormous tree, its bark covered with grey mosses and clumps of a giant species of maidenhair fern. On our side of it was the open space which may have measured forty feet across, where the light fell in a perpendicular ray, as it does through the <b>smoke-hole</b> of a hut. Looking at this prostrate trunk, I saw first two lurid and fiery eyes that glowed red in the shadow; and then, almost in the same instant, made out what looked like the head of a fiend enclosed in a wreath of the delicate green ferns. I can't describe it, I can only repeat that it looked like the head of a very large fiend with a pallid face, huge overhanging eyebrows and great yellow tushes {{on either side of the}} mouth.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{all this}} while, {{although}} she dared {{not so much}} as whisper, Sihamba had not been idle, for with the blade of the assegai she was working gently at the thatch of the <b>smoke-hole,</b> and cutting the rimpis that bound it, till at last, and not too soon, she thought that it was wide enough to allow of the passage of her small body. Then watching until the guard leaned against the hut, so that the bulge of it would cut her off from his sight, during the instant that her figure was outlined against the sky, she stood up, and thrusting her feet through the hole, forced her body to follow them, and then dropped lightly as a cat to the floor beneath. But now there was another danger to be faced, and a great one, namely, that Suzanne might cry out in fear, which doubtless she would have done, had not the sudden sight of some living creature in the hut where she thought herself alone, so startled her that for a moment she lost her breath. Before she could find it again Sihamba was whispering in her ear, saying: ...|$|E
60|$|I crept to {{the door}} of the hut and looked out. The night was dark and I could see none about, and could hear no one move, yet, being cautious, I walked round the hut. Ah, my father, when you have a secret to tell, be not so easily deceived. It is not enough to look forth and to peer round. Dig beneath the floor, and search the roof also; then, having done all this, go {{elsewhere}} and tell your tale. The woman was right: I was but a fool, for all my wisdom and my white hairs. Had I not been a fool I would have smoked out that rat in the thatch before ever I opened my lips. For the rat was Zinita, my father--Zinita, who had climbed the hut, and now lay there in the dark, her ear upon the <b>smoke-hole,</b> listening to every word that passed. It was a wicked thing to do, and, moreover, the worst of omens, but there is little honour among women when they learn that which others wish to hide away from them, nor, indeed, do they then weight omens.|$|E
60|$|Rachel woke {{from her}} stupor {{to find herself}} lying on a bed in a great Kaffir hut that was {{furnished}} like a European room, for in it were chairs and a table, also rough window places closed with reed mats that took the place of glass. Through the <b>smoke-hole</b> {{at the top of}} the hut struck a straight ray of sunlight, by which she judged that it must be about midday. She began to think, till by degrees everything came back to her, and in that hour she nearly died of horror and of grief. Indeed she was minded to die. There at her side lay a means of death--the assegai which she had found by the body of the Zulu in Ramah, and none had taken from her. She lifted it and felt its edge, then laid it down again. Into the darkness of her despair some comfort seemed to creep. She was sure that Richard lived, and if she died, he would die also. While he lived, why should she die? Moreover, it would be a crime which she should only dare when all hope had gone and she stood face to face with shame.|$|E
60|$|Thus I {{reflected}} {{until at}} length light flowing faintly through the <b>smoke-hole</b> {{of the hut}} told me that dawn was at hand. Seeing it I rose quietly, for I {{did not wish to}} wake Anscombe, dressed and left the hut. My object was to find Nombe, who I hoped would be still sitting by the fire, and send her to Zikali with a message that I wished to speak with him at once. Glancing round me in the grey dawn I saw that she was gone and that as yet no one seemed to be stirring. Hearing a horse snort at a little distance, I made my way towards the sound and in a little bay of the overhanging cliff discovered the cart and near by our beasts tied up with a plentiful supply of forage. Since so far as I could judge in that uncertain light, nothing seemed to be wrong with them except weariness, for three of them were still lying down, I walked on to the gate of the fence which surrounded Zikali's big hut, proposing to wait there until some one appeared by whom I could send my message.|$|E
60|$|When Piet {{went out}} {{he left the}} door-board of the hut open, so that Sihamba dared neither act nor speak, fearing lest the guard should hear or see her through it. Therefore she still lay upon {{the top of the}} hut, and watched through the <b>smoke-hole.</b> For a while Suzanne sat quiet upon the bed, then of a sudden she rose from it, and {{shuffling}} across the hut as well as her bound feet would allow her, she closed the opening with the door-board, and secured it by its wooden bar. Next she returned to the bed and, seating upon it, clasped her hands and began to pray, muttering aloud and mixing with her prayer the name of her husband Ralph. Ceasing presently, she thrust her hand into her bosom and drew from it a knife, not large, but strong and very sharp. Opening this knife she cut the thong that bound her ankles, and made it into a noose. Then she looked earnestly first at the noose, next at the knife, and thirdly at the candles, and Sihamba understood that she meant to do herself to death, and was choosing between steel and rope and fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely, Bull-Head," [...] {{answered}} the little woman, walking forward {{from where she}} stood behind the schimmel. [...] "Where else should I be? I pray you, soldiers, draw a little way but not far apart, that yonder half-breed may satisfy his eyes with the sight of me. So, a little way, but not far, for I who know him like him best at a distance. Now, Bull-Head," [...] she went on, [...] "what {{is it that you}} wish to talk about--the Englishman, Ralph Kenzie, the husband of Swallow yonder? You thought you killed him. Well, it was not so; I lifted him living from the water, and I, who am a doctoress, tell you that his wound is of no account, and that soon he will be strong again and seeking a word with you, Half-breed. No, not of him? Then perhaps it is of your hidden krantz and the new hut you built in it. Bah! I knew its secret long ago and--that hut has too wide a <b>smoke-hole.</b> Go back and ask him who guarded it if this is not true. What! Not of that either? Then would you speak of the ride which we have taken? Ah! man, I thought at least that you were no coward, and yet even when you had us in your hand, you did not dare to face the Red Water which two women swam on one tired horse. Look at him, soldiers, look at the brave cross-bred chief who dared not swim his horse across one little stream." ...|$|E
5000|$|A smoke hole (smokehole, <b>smoke-hole)</b> is {{a hole in}} a roof for {{the smoke}} from a fire to vent. Before the {{invention}} of the smoke hood or chimney, dwellings had smoke holes to allow the smoke from the hearth to escape.|$|E
50|$|Some Tuvans, even near Kyzyl, {{still live}} in {{traditional}} yurts, round, demountable and portable dwellings with sectional lath trellis walls, decorated pole roofs and covered with white felt and canvas, with colourful cloth lining. There is a central <b>smoke-hole</b> above the hearth or stove. It is used to tell the time as the sunlight moves around inside the yurt. The interior is arranged with the man's side to the left, the woman's {{to the right of}} the door facing East, with the altar cupboard facing that.|$|E
50|$|Gut or {{intestines}} (qilu, qiluq, qiluk sg qiluit pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, qilu in Cup'ig) {{and large}} intestines (qilurpak sg qilurpiit pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, qilurpag in Cup'ig) {{were used to}} make waterproof raincoat parkas and boots.

The seal-gut material (qalirkaq in Yup'ik and Cup'ik), esp. baby bearded-seal gut (maklagaat qalirkait) were used for <b>smoke-hole</b> window.|$|E
5000|$|The Pawnee {{seasonal}} rituals {{were tied}} to the observation of the stars and planets. Their earthwork lodges were built {{at the same time}} as observatories and as [...] "microcosm" [...] (scale-model of the universe).Each lodge [...] "was at the same time the universe and also the womb of a woman, and the household activities represented her reproductive powers." [...] The lodge also represented the universe in a more practical way. The physical construction of the house required setting up four posts to represent the four cardinal directions, “aligned almost exactly with the north-south, east-west axis.A Pawnee observatory-lodge also required an unobstructed view of the eastern sky. The lodge's axis would be oriented east-west in such a way that the sunrise of vernal equinox would cast light on the altar. The dimensions of the lodge's smoke hola and door would be designed to allow observation of the sky, e. g. with the <b>smoke-hole</b> aligned to enable observation of the Pleiades.|$|E
5000|$|Horno ( [...] ) is a mud adobe-built outdoor oven used by Native Americans {{and early}} {{settlers}} of North America. Originally {{introduced to the}} Iberian Peninsula by the Moors, it was quickly adopted and carried to all Spanish-occupied lands. The horno has a beehive shape and uses wood as the heat source. The procedure still used in parts of New Mexico and Arizona {{is to build a}} fire inside the horno and, when the proper amount of time has passed, remove the embers and ashes and insert the bread to be cooked. In the case of corn, the embers are doused with water and the corn is then inserted into the horno to be [...] "steam"-cooked. When cooking meats, the oven is fired to a [...] "white hot" [...] temperature (approximately 650 °F or 340 °C), the coals are moved {{to the back of the}} oven, and the meats placed inside. The <b>smoke-hole</b> and door are sealed with mud. A twenty-one-pound turkey will take 2½ to 3 hours to cook. [...] It comes out very succulent. Since the horno is made of adobe, it wicks the moisture into the food in a natural convection.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the floor}} of the home is not exactly earthen, a fire-pit is dug {{in the center of the}} common room, and this pit is lined with stones which are laid out some {{distance}} outward from there in case of sparks that may jump from a five, with a <b>smoke-hole</b> in the center of the roof. The floor is made first of pounded earth, overlaid with many layers thick of grass mats, which are “added to on a daily basis,” it being the “duty of every member of the family old enough to do so” to weave one grass mat in the morning and lay it where the mats are looking shabby. As the mats at the bottom decompose and disintegrate, they are replaced from above, and insects are driven off by the pine needles and herbs that are layered between the mats. Although there are no windows in these homes, adequate light is provided by crude oil lamps around the interior wall, though the lack of windows is inspired primarily by the fact that the Northern Tribes are found in the Icewall Mountains, and north of them, where the weather is terribly frigid. The residential cubicles of the home are formed by partitions about six to eight paces apart, which extend about six to eight paces into the center of the home, and these cubicles are as often used for storage as habitation. A rope across the front of each cubicle allows for a curtain to be hung to facilitate a certain degree of privacy, but there are shelves across the back and side walls of every cubicle, to allow for a degree of personal storage, as well.|$|E
