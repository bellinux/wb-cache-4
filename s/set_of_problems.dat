25|$|This motivates {{the concept}} of a problem being hard for a {{complexity}} class. A problem X is hard for a class of problems C if every problem in C can be reduced to X. Thus no problem in C is harder than X, since an algorithm for X allows us to solve any problem in C. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than P, polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> that are hard for NP is the set of NP-hard problems.|$|E

However, 25 December the Soviet government authorized selection of a second group of 60 trainees, including women. By the end of January, 1962, Kamanin collected 58 women's resumes and picked 23 who still had to pass the physical tests. 12 March, a group of five women was picked for active training; 29 March he identified Valentina Tereshkova, Irina Solovyova and Tatyana Kuznetsova as the most capable for the flight.

25|$|For the {{complexity}} classes defined in this way, {{it is desirable}} to prove that relaxing the requirements on (say) computation time indeed defines a bigger <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems.</b> In particular, although DTIME(n) is contained in DTIME(n2), {{it would be interesting}} to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.|$|E

2500|$|One {{response}} to this question is called nihilism. Nihilism states that there are no mereological complex objects (read: [...] composite objects); there are only simples.

More formally Nihilists would say: Necessarily, for any non-overlapping Xs, there is an object composed of the Xs if and only if there {{is only one of the}} Xs.

2500|$|The M43 never {{rose above}} the status of [...] "interim weapon" [...] due {{to a number of}} {{shortcomings}} and issues with both the agent and the delivery system. BZ was expensive and difficult to synthesize, and this expense made large-area use of BZ impractical. Agent manufacture presented its own <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems.</b> BZ was susceptible to accidental ignition on the production line. The weaponization of BZ presented other problems including the agent cloud's easy visibility, and simple counter-measures (such as a few layers of cloth over the mouth and nose) could defeat it. In addition, the agent's [...] "envelope-of-action" [...] and rate of action were of questionable effectiveness. Between 50% and 80% of BZ casualties had to be restrained during recovery to prevent self-injury; other common symptoms during recovery were paranoia and mania. The combination of these issues made BZ weapons, the M43 and M44 generator cluster, unattractive to military planners.|$|E
2500|$|In {{mathematical}} psychology, antimatroids {{have been}} used to describe feasible states of knowledge of a human learner. Each element of the antimatroid represents a concept that is to be understood by the learner, or a class of problems that he or {{she might be able to}} solve correctly, and the sets of elements that form the antimatroid represent possible sets of concepts that could be understood by a single person. The axioms defining an antimatroid may be phrased informally as stating that learning one concept can never prevent the learner from learning another concept, and that any feasible state of knowledge can be reached by learning a single concept at a time. The task of a knowledge assessment system is to infer the set of concepts known by a given learner by analyzing his or her responses to a small and well-chosen <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems.</b> In this context antimatroids have also been called [...] "learning spaces" [...] and [...] "well-graded knowledge spaces".|$|E
2500|$|For {{a precise}} {{definition}} {{of what it means}} to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space, a computational model such as the deterministic Turing machine is used. The time required by a deterministic Turing machine M on input x is the total number of state transitions, or steps, the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer ("yes" [...] or [...] "no"). A Turing machine M is said to operate within time f(n), if the time required by M on each input of length n is at most f(n). A decision problem A can be solved in time f(n) if there exists a Turing machine operating in time f(n) that solves the problem. Since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty, one defines sets of problems based on some criteria. For instance, the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> solvable within time f(n) on a deterministic Turing machine is then denoted by DTIME(f(n)).|$|E
