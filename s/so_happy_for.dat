500|$|On July 25, Feldman outpitched Kansas City All-Star and AL ERA leader Zack Greinke {{with eight}} innings of four-hit, shutout ball, leading the Rangers to a 2–0 victory. [...] "Feldman matched the best pitcher in baseball", Washington said. [...] "I’m <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>for</b> him. Two {{pitchers}} went at it pretty good, and our's won the battle." [...] The eight innings were Feldman's major-league high, as he mixed in a changeup, curveball, and slider with his fastball.|$|E
500|$|Variety {{discussed}} a possible sequel, saying {{it could happen}} if Speed Racer had a good box office performance. In 2008, a possible sequel was contemplated by the Wachowskis when Rain asked them why his character is <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>for</b> Speed winning, and they replied it could be explained in the next film. Rain said he was hired for 3 years, while noting that doesn't guarantee a sequel will be released. Christina Ricci also considered it a possibility; she stated [...] "When we [...] were all leaving, we were like 'write the sequel!' 'We want to come back'. And they [...] were like, 'I know. I know. We're going to. Don't worry'.", adding she would like more action scenes to her character. The producer Joel Silver said that the Wachowskis [...] "have a great story idea for a sequel" [...] {{but that it is}} [...] "a great idea for a sequel if it makes sense to make it." ...|$|E
500|$|Swift was {{inspired}} to write [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] about her experience with a boy named Drew Hardwick, a classmate of hers whom she had feelings for. Hardwick later went on to join the Navy. During their freshman {{year of high school}} at Hendersonville High School, Swift and Hardwick sat beside each other in a class everyday. The two developed a fond friendship, although Swift secretively desired for it to become a romantic relationship. Because of Hardwick's unawareness, he would frequently speak to Swift about a girl he had feelings for, something Swift pretended to be endeared by, commenting, [...] "How beautiful she was, how nice and smart and perfect she was. And I sat there and listened, never meaning it any of the times I said 'Oh, I'm <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>for</b> you.'" [...] Hardwick and his love interest eventually developed a relationship which lasted for a few years. Swift never confessed her feelings to him. By the release of Taylor Swift, he remained unaware of Swift's intentions or the song and continued his relationship with the same female. Upon [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar"'s release as a single, Hardwick attempted to contact Swift via phone calls, which Swift did not respond to; he then left voicemails, but Swift felt too awkward to call back.|$|E

60|$|I {{never saw}} a boy look <b>so</b> <b>happy.</b> As <b>for</b> Laddie, who was sitting beside him with his shaggy head on Ernest's knee, I really believe the dog understood, too. The {{look in his eyes}} was almost human. Uncle Richard leaned over and patted him.|$|R
60|$|He {{gave his}} dry chuckle {{to see her}} so fired with pleasure, and he enjoyed the ardor with which she drove him up out of his chair, and dashed off her letters. This was her old way; {{he would have liked}} the {{prospect}} of the Hallecks coming, because it made his girl <b>so</b> <b>happy,</b> if <b>for</b> nothing else.|$|R
2500|$|The American {{rock band}} Fall Out Boy {{released}} a song titled [...] "Uma Thurman" [...] in 2015, celebrating the actress and her roles in Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. She gave permission {{for the band}} to use her name, and during an interview on the Today Show, stated: [...] "It's very, like unbelievably polite and gracious of them. So sweet. I'm <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>for</b> their big success".|$|E
2500|$|Newly crowned {{champion}} di Grassi said of {{his title}} success, [...] "This journey, this day started {{three years ago when}} we started season one, and then {{we got a lot of}} good results. I arrived in London fighting for the championship, even though I got disqualified from winning a race. Season two, the same situation, even got disqualified from winning a race. Finally I came here as an underdog, 10 points behind and had the nerves to keep calm, I did the job yesterday and today managed to win it also. I’m <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>for</b> my team, <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>for</b> the ABT Schaeffler Audi Sport guys, they really deserve it." [...] He later claimed to have not given up hope in winning the championship despite a competitive field and retiring from the Paris ePrix, but also admitted that focusing on Formula E after Audi's withdrawal from the World Endurance Championship at the end of 2016 aided his title effort. While Buemi admitted his disappointment in losing the championship, he congratulated di Grassi on securing the accolade, and stated him missing the New York City races was not an excuse in his loss. Regarding his pit stop early in the race, Buemi chose not to judge if the stewards made the correct decision and admitted not knowing about the regulation that required him to enter the pit lane because of car damage.|$|E

6000|$|... "No!--dear, brave Philip--but only <b>so</b> thankful and <b>happy</b> <b>for</b> your escape." [...] Yet, at {{the same}} moment the colour faded from her cheek, and even the sun-kissed line of her upper lip grew bloodless, as she leaned back against a tree.|$|R
5000|$|On 26 January 2016, Pato flew to London {{to undergo}} a medical at English Premier League side Chelsea. Three days later, Chelsea {{announced}} the signing of Pato on loan from the Brazilian club, {{until the end of}} the 2015-16 season. Upon signing, Pato said, [...] "I am <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> to sign <b>for</b> Chelsea. It is a dream for me.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with the Sydney Morning Herald, Daniel Hales, brother of Bruce Hales (the current worldwide Brethren leader), explained how they could support political parties and not vote: [...] "I see it as a sin and you don't. <b>So</b> I'm very <b>happy</b> <b>for</b> you to vote because to you it's your obligation to the community. But to me, it's my conscience that doesn't allow me to vote." ...|$|R

She has made me <b>so</b> <b>happy.</b> We are all thrilled about it and I can't wait {{to be with her}} on set to show her around." [...] A show source added [...] "Brooke was behind her all the way and was praying she would get the part - and after Ellie won the bosses over she couldn't contain herself. She was <b>so</b> pleased and <b>happy</b> <b>for</b> her. Ellie-Louise is made of the same stuff as Brooke, which means she'll fit in and get on well with everyone." ...|$|R
6000|$|Dennet {{had told}} her husband {{that she had been}} amazed to find how, in spite of a very warm affection for her, her husband, and children, her father hankered after the old name, and grieved that he could not fulfil his old {{engagement}} to his cousin Robert. Giles Headley had managed the business excellently during Stephen's absence, had shown himself very capable, and gained good opinions from all. Rubbing about in the world had been very good for him; and she verily believed that nothing would make her father <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> as <b>for</b> them to offer to share the business with Giles. She would on her part make Aldonza welcome, and had no fears of not agreeing with her. Besides--if little Giles were indeed to be heir to Testside was not the way made clear? ...|$|R

It makes my heart swell with such delight to know that those who speak of you must say you married a poor disowned girl, who had taken shelter here; who had no other home, no other friends; who had nothing--nothing! Oh, Walter, if I could have brought you millions, I never could have been <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>for</b> your sake, as I am!' ...|$|E

50|$|In 2012 {{when the}} Daytona 500 {{frustrated}} many fans and NASCAR officials {{because of a}} long rain delay on the planned date, a rain delay in the morning, and then the bizarre fire red flag delay caused by Juan Pablo Montoya's crash into a jet dryer in turn 3 on lap 160, Smith told the public he was <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> and excited <b>for</b> {{the first time in}} his career to leave Daytona that night.

5000|$|The {{verses of}} the song are closest in {{structure}} to the 1963 rendition (titled [...] "Stewball") by Peter, Paul and Mary, itself based on the classical version recorded during the early 1940s by folk singer Woody Guthrie. Furthermore, Lennon may have modelled the lyric [...] "And <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> Christmas / <b>For</b> black and for white / For yellow and red ones…" [...] on a verse from the 1968 single [...] "Everyday People" [...] by Sly and the Family Stone: [...] "There is a yellow one / That won't accept the black one / That won't accept the red one / That won't accept the white one…" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was on the}} {{following}} Thursday, when I came home in the evening, that Euphemia met me with a glowing face. It rather surprised me to see her look <b>so</b> <b>happy,</b> <b>for</b> she had been very quiet and preoccupied {{for the first part}} of the week. So much so, indeed, that I had thought of ordering smaller roasts for a week or two, and taking her to a Thomas Concert with the money saved. But this evening she looked as if she did not need Thomas's orchestra.|$|E
6000|$|... '...I went to {{the opera}} on Tuesday, but was too much taken up by Eton to rave about it, though Grisi's singing and acting were out and out; but, in sober earnest, I think if one was to look out simply for one's own selfish {{pleasure}} in this world, staying at Eton in the summer is paradise. I certainly have not been more happy, if <b>so</b> <b>happy,</b> <b>for</b> years, and they need no convincing there of my doting attachment to the place. I go down to Eton on Election Saturday and Sunday for my last enjoyment of it this year; but if I am well and nourishing {{in the summer of}} 1849, and all goes right with me, {{it is one of the}} jolliest prospects of my emancipation from the schools to think of a month at Eton.

Having told how she disposed of her tales, Jo added, [...] "And when I went to get my answer, the man said he liked them both, but didn't pay beginners, only let them print in his paper, and noticed the stories.

5|$|Returning to New York, he and Thomashefsky jointly leased The People's Theater, {{intending}} {{to use it}} on different nights of the week. Adler, exhausted from his Russian trip, was often leaving his nights unused, and Thomashefsky offered to buy him out for $10,000 {{on the condition that}} he would not return to performing in New York. Adler was so insulted that the two did not speak for months, even though at the time they were living across a courtyard from one another, and could see into each other's St. Mark's Place apartments. Adler decided to perform Tolstoy's The Power of Darkness, and decided that he would do his own translation from Russian to Yiddish. The play was a great success, the first successful production of a Tolstoy play in the U.S., and Thomashefsky was <b>so</b> obviously <b>happy</b> <b>for</b> Adler that their friendship was renewed. Adler followed with equally successful productions of Gordin's dramatization of Tolstoy's Resurrection and the Gordin original The Homeless.|$|R

He had worked all the long day to make a hole through the dam which some one had built across the Laughing Brook and so stopped its laughter. Now the water was running again, and soon the new, strange pond behind the dam there in the Green Forest would be gone, and the Laughing Brook and the Smiling Pool would be their own beautiful selves once more. It was because he {{had worked so hard}} all day {{that he was going to}} sleep now. Usually he would rather sleep a part of the day and be abroad at night.|$|R

There is not a woman in the world, however exalted her rank, however admirable her beauty, however gifted her being, who might not feel happy and honoured in the homage of such a man. Believe me, my dearest daughter, that this is an union which must lead to happiness. Indeed, were it to occur, I could die content. I should have no more cares, no more hopes.

60|$|When {{the spring}} came round, Hetta and Paul were married by the Bishop at the parish church of Carbury, and Roger Carbury gave away the bride. All {{those who saw}} the {{ceremony}} declared that the squire had not seemed to be <b>so</b> <b>happy</b> <b>for</b> many a long year. John Crumb, who was there with his wife,--himself now one of Roger's tenants, having occupied the land which had become vacant {{by the death of}} old Daniel Ruggles,--declared that the wedding was almost as good fun as his own. 'John, what a fool you are!' Ruby said to her spouse, when this opinion was expressed with rather a loud voice. 'Yes, I be,' said John,--'but not such a fool as to a missed a having o' you.' 'No, John; it was I was the fool then,' said Ruby. 'We'll see about that when the bairn's born,' said John,--equally aloud. Then Ruby held her tongue. Mrs Broune, and Mr Broune, were also at Carbury,--thus doing great honour to Mr and Mrs Paul Montague, and showing by their presence that all family feuds were at an end. Sir Felix was not there. Happily up to this time Mr Septimus Blake had continued to keep that gentleman as one of his Protestant population in the German town,--no doubt not without considerable trouble to himself.|$|E

Varney dropped those airs of pretension and gallantry which had marked his former approaches; and Amy, on the other hand, seemed to renounce the ill-disguised disgust with which she had regarded them. They seemed to have more of privacy and confidence together than I fully liked, and I suspected that they met in private, where there was less restraint than in our presence. Many circumstances, which I noticed but little at the time--for I deemed her heart as open as her angelic countenance--have since arisen on my memory, to convince me of their private understanding. But I need not detail them--the fact speaks for itself. She vanished from her father's house; Varney disappeared at the same time; and this very day I have seen her in the character of his paramour, living in the house of his sordid dependant Foster, and visited by him, muffled, and by a secret entrance." ...|$|E

2500|$|In these {{difficult}} times {{the one person}} who continuously provided moral support to Pisemsky was Ivan Turgenev.
