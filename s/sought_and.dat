5|$|According to the game's back-story, Necrid {{was once}} a human warrior. He <b>sought</b> <b>and</b> found the cursed sword Soul Edge, only to be pulled into the {{dimension}} that the sword's spirit inhabits.

5|$|Baldwin {{was with}} King Henry {{shortly before the}} latter's death, taking part in {{unsuccessful}} efforts to negotiate a truce with Henry's heir, Prince Richard, who had rebelled against his father. After Henry's death, Richard <b>sought</b> <b>and</b> obtained absolution for the sin of disobedience to his father from both Baldwin and Walter de Coutances, Archbishop of Rouen. Baldwin, along with Coutances, was with Richard on 20 July 1189 at Rouen when the king was invested with the Duchy of Normandy. Baldwin crowned Richard at Westminster Abbey on 13 September 1189 in the first English coronation for which a detailed description survives.|$|E
5|$|Because of its ongoing {{structural}} weaknesses, in 1957 the London County Council proposed {{replacing the}} Albert Bridge {{with a more}} conventional design. A protest campaign led by John Betjeman resulted in {{the withdrawal of the}} proposal, but serious concerns about the integrity of the bridge continued. In 1964 an experimental tidal flow scheme was introduced, in which only northbound traffic was permitted to use the bridge in the mornings and southbound traffic in the evenings. The bridge's condition continued to deteriorate however, and in 1970 the Greater London Council (GLC) <b>sought</b> <b>and</b> obtained consent to carry out strengthening work. In April 1972 the bridge was closed for the work to be carried out.|$|E

5|$|Harding <b>sought</b> <b>and</b> {{gained the}} 1910 Republican gubernatorial nomination. At that time, {{the party was}} deeply divided between {{progressive}} and conservative wings, and could not defeat the united Democrats; he lost the election to incumbent Judson Harmon. Harry Daugherty managed Harding's campaign, but the defeated candidate did not hold the loss against him. Despite the growing rift between them, both President Taft and former president Roosevelt came to Ohio to campaign for Harding, but their quarrels split the Republican Party and helped assure Harding's defeat.|$|E
5|$|In 1666 John Mylne {{designed}} and {{was engaged to}} build Panmure House, near Forfar, for the 2nd Earl of Panmure. After his death, the work was continued by Alexander Nisbet, possibly {{with the assistance of}} William Bruce. This house, demolished in 1950, resembled Heriot's Hospital and other Scottish 17th-century buildings, rather than looking forward to the new classical styles which would be introduced by Bruce. During the Second Anglo-Dutch War of 1665–1667, Mylne {{designed and}} built fortifications at Lerwick, which were later reconstructed as Fort Charlotte. He provided a design for Linlithgow's tolbooth in 1667, but following his death another mason was <b>sought,</b> <b>and</b> a different design built. Another scheme was for Leslie House, carried out after his death by Robert Mylne, again with the advice of Bruce.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Abu Ali Iyad {{was born}} in Qalqilyah in the modern-day West Bank when Palestine was under the British Mandate. He was educated there, {{graduating from high school}} in 1953 and taught at schools in the city and nearby Azzun. A year later, he moved to Baquba, Iraq where he {{enrolled}} in a teacher training program. He left Iraq the same year, moving to Saudi Arabia to teach there afterward. In 1962, he had a job as a teacher in Algeria. However, he soon <b>sought</b> <b>and</b> received training by the Algerian Army, graduating from its training course in the summer of 1964.|$|E

5|$|In 1938, {{representative}} {{measures for}} embracing the German-Japanese partnership were <b>sought</b> <b>and</b> {{the construction of}} a new Japanese embassy building in Berlin was started. After the preceding embassy had to give way to Hitler's and Albert Speer's plans of re-modeling Berlin to the world capital city of Germania, a new and more pompous building was erected in a newly established diplomatic district next to the Tiergarten. It was conceived by Ludwig Moshamer under the supervision of Speer and was placed opposite the Italian embassy, thereby bestowing an architectural emphasis on the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis.|$|E
5|$|In {{classical}} Pentecostalism, the baptism {{with the}} Holy Spirit {{is understood to}} be a separate and distinct experience occurring sometime after regeneration. It is an empowering experience, equipping Spirit-filled believers for witness and ministry. Extending from this {{is the belief that}} all the spiritual gifts mentioned in the New Testament are to be <b>sought</b> <b>and</b> exercised to build up the church. Pentecostals believe that Spirit baptism will be accompanied by the physical evidence of speaking in tongues (glossolalia).|$|E
5|$|In view {{of rapidly}} {{mounting}} British pressure and an ensuing armed conflict over {{the position of}} the Uitlanders and economic control over the Witwatersrand gold fields, foreign policy in the South African Republic was eventually determined by a triumvirate: State President Kruger, State Secretary Reitz, and State Attorney General J.C. Smuts. During 1899 they decided that an offensive attitude towards British demands was the only way forward, despite the risks this entailed. Reitz <b>sought</b> <b>and</b> received the support of the Orange Free State for this approach. On 9 October 1899 the South African Republic and the Orange Free State issued a joint ultimatum to the British government to retract their demands.|$|E

5|$|The First Chicago Marathon was run on September 23, 1905. That {{first race}} began in Evanston and {{finished}} {{in front of}} a standing-room-only paying crowd at Washington Park race track. In a stunning upset, a reported 100,000 or more spectators watched Rhud Metzner come from behind to steal a late-race victory from the favored Louis Marks. With that first race, the Chicago Marathon began an annual run of epic races that continued until the early 1920s on a revised course that largely resembles today's marathon route. Over the years elite fields included Olympic champions, world records were continually <b>sought,</b> <b>and</b> the marathon continued to inspire Chicago communities and spectators until challenges of the early 1920s sidelined the event.|$|E
5|$|The Hornet Upgrade program (HUG) {{commenced}} in 1999. The project <b>sought</b> <b>and</b> {{continues to}} seek to modernise {{the ability of the}} current ACG fleet of F/A-18A and F/A-18B aircraft and associated support systems. The upgrade project has been set up to elongate the time the Hornet's can run until 2018. The project is being conducted in three phases. This project was established to upgrade the F/A-18 fleet to combine enrichments that will allow the aircraft to more effectively perform its air defence tasks. The project is being conducted in three main phases, phase one has already concluded and phases two and three are currently in production.|$|E
5|$|The reason Byzantine Greek merchants {{have often}} been {{neglected}} in historiography {{is not that they}} were any less able than their ancient or modern Greek colleagues in matters of trade. It rather originated with the way history was written in Byzantium, which was often under the patronage of their competitors, the court, and land aristocracy. The fact that they were eventually surpassed by their Italian rivals is attributable to the privileges <b>sought</b> <b>and</b> acquired by the Crusader States within the Levant and the dominant maritime violence of the Italians.|$|E

5|$|Thomas {{attended}} Western High School {{for three}} years before entering a U.S. Naval Academy preparatory school. He <b>sought</b> <b>and</b> secured an appointment to Annapolis from President Theodore Roosevelt, and was asked to take the admission examination. The Navy was undergoing a period of expansion, and the intake of midshipmen was double that of two years earlier. Of the 350 who took the examination, 283 were admitted. The class was the largest since the Academy had opened in 1845.|$|E
5|$|After some deliberation, with {{opinions}} <b>sought</b> <b>and</b> {{obtained from}} Percival Keith, Norris Bradbury, Darol Froman, Elmer E. Kirkpatrick, Kenneth Nichols and Edward Teller, {{it was decided}} that this could be done safely if appropriate precautions were taken. On 28 November 1946, the K-25 plant began producing 94 percent product. At this point, they ran into a serious flaw in the gaseous diffusion concept: enrichment in uranium-235 also enriched the product in the unwanted and fairly useless uranium-234, making it difficult to raise the enrichment to 95 percent. On 6 December 1946, production was dropped back to a steady 2.56kg per day enriched to 93.7 percent uranium-235, along with 1.9 percent uranium-234. This was regarded as satisfactory product by the Los Alamos Laboratory, so on 26 December 1946 enrichment activity at Y-12 was curtailed. The Manhattan Project ended a few days later. Responsibility for the K-25 facility then passed to the new Atomic Energy Commission on 1 January 1947.|$|E
5|$|Cathedral {{officials}} also described {{the use of}} guns in a city which has a gun crime problem as irresponsible. The Bishop of Manchester, the Right Reverend Nigel McCulloch, stated that it was well known that Manchester had a gun crime problem, {{and that it was}} beyond belief that a global manufacturer would re-create one of their Cathedrals with photo-realistic quality. Insomniac, the game's developer, declined to comment, referring all inquires to Sony Computer Entertainment Europe. Sony Computer Entertainment Europe issued a statement, stating that they were aware of the concerns expressed by the Bishop of Manchester and the Cathedral authorities, and take them seriously. However, they added that Resistance: Fall of Man is a fantasy science fiction game and not based on reality and that they believed they had <b>sought</b> <b>and</b> received all permissions necessary. Sony also stated that it would be contacting the Cathedral on 11 June 2007 to understand their concerns in more detail. David Wilson, a Sony spokesman, told The Times that it was game-created footage, and not video or photography. Further, he compared it to science fiction shows such as Doctor Who, claiming that it was not based on reality at all.|$|E
