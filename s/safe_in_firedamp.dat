The Mine Safety Appliances Company Ltd. manufactured the first type - W8 Methanometer around 1950 and it was approved for use by the Ventilation Regulations of 1947. The Methanometer could be powered by an Edison battery cap lamp and it could be carried on a miner's belt with other tools. Methane is the main gas present <b>in</b> <b>firedamp.</b> It is highly explosive and had previously been detected by the blue halo effect it gave to the flame of a safety lamp.|$|R

5000|$|Work to sink Elsecar Low Colliery started around 1840 {{but took}} 6-8 years to {{complete}} and the first significant coal was mined in 1848 when 1000 tonnes a day was being extracted (4). [...] The major difficulty was the penetration of water into the workings and dealing with large amounts of firedamp. [...] The colliery had two shafts, a winding shaft and a smaller diameter pumping shaft for draining the colliery. The colliery suffered a significant accident on 21 December 1852 when a firedamp explosion killed 10 miners and injured 12. The inquiry found that the explosion had been caused by reckless behaviour of the colliers; a ventilation door had been propped open which resulted <b>in</b> <b>firedamp</b> accumulating and some colliers using unguarded safety lamps. Earl Fitzwilliam's mine superintendent, Benjamin Biram was criticised by the inquiry for absence of printed rules in the colliery, inadequate maintenance of lamps and poor supervision of the workforce but the judge praised the ventilation arrangements in the pit which prevented extensive loss of life.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{diesel engine}} {{protection}} principles used <b>in</b> <b>firedamp</b> mines have remained practically unchanged {{since they were}} originally introduced into mines. The protection used is aimed at preventing excessive temperatures, flames, and sparks from appearing and preventing the transmission of combustion inside the engine into the atmosphere. All the regulations in force in most mining countries require the limiting of surface temperatures and exhaust gases, {{a more or less}} flameproof design for the engine and safety equipment, and the installation of flame arresting devices in the intake circuit and exhaust circuit. The old French mining regulations defined the requirements for the approval of liquid fuel locomotives in the ministerial order of 30 th October 1961. A minimum length of 25 mm was required for the flameproof joints on the enclosures formed by the intake and exhaust Systems. The tests defined in this order had to prove that the endosures could withstand a pressure equal to 1. 5 times the maximum pressure developed by a mixture of air and 9. 8 % of methane and prevent transmission of the intemal combustion of a mixture of air and methane to the outside...|$|R
