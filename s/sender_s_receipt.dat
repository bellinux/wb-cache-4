40|$|Abstract. In {{electronic}} {{communications and}} in access to systems, {{the issue of}} authentication of the <b>Sender</b> <b>S</b> of a message M, aswellasofthe message itself, is of paramount importance. Recently S. Goldwasser has raised the additional issue of Deniable Authentication where the <b>sender</b> <b>S</b> authenticates the message M to the Receiver’s (R) satisfaction, but can later deny his authorship of M even to an Inquisitor INQ who has listened to the exchange between S and R and who gains access {{to all of the}} the secret information used by S and R. We present two practical schemes for Deniable Authentication of messages M of arbitrary length n. In both schemes the Receiver R is assured with probability greater than 1 − 2 −k,wherekis a chosen security parameter, that M originated with the <b>Sender</b> <b>S.</b> Deniability is absolute in the information theoretic sense. The first scheme requires 2. 4 kn XOR operations on bits and one public key encoding and decoding of a short message. The second scheme requires the same number of XOR operations and k multiplications mod N, whereNis some fixed product of two large primes. A key new feature of our method is the use of a Shannon-style error correction code. Traditional authentication for a long message M starts by hashing M down to a standard word-size. We expand M through error correction. The first Deniable Authentication method is provably valid for any encryption scheme with minimal security properties, i. e. this method is generic. The second Deniable Authentication method is provably valid under the usual assumption that factorization is intractable. Background and New Results The question of authentication of transmitted messages is of paramount importance. When a <b>Sender</b> <b>S</b> communicates with a receiver R and sends him a message M, it does not suffice for R to authenticate (identify) S in order to know that M has actually originated with S. AnAdversaryAD can actively tap the line between S and R, andafterRhas authenticated the <b>sender</b> <b>S,</b> AD can block the Sender’s transmission and inject his own message ¯ M to R...|$|R

30|$|The {{basic idea}} behind {{opportunistic}} forwarding is that relay nodes are selected {{in such a}} way that the highest geographical gain is introduced per message retransmit. In other words, when a <b>sender</b> <b>S</b> broadcasts a DENM message, only the nodes located at the edge of S’ transmission domain are selected as forwarding nodes F (Figure 5). To achieve this behavior, every node has to wait a certain time before it gets the opportunity to retransmit a received message. This waiting time is dependent on the distance between the previous sender of the message and the possible relay node: the larger the distance, the shorter the waiting time. If the waiting timer of a relay candidate expires and it has not yet overheard a retransmission of the same packet by any of its neighbors, then it is allowed to retransmit the message. However, when such a retransmit is overheard during the waiting phase, the node cancels its timer and destroys the message.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} {{perfectly}} secure message transmission concerns two synchronized non-faulty processors <b>sender</b> (<b>S)</b> and receiver (R) that are {{connected by a}} synchronous network of n ≥ 2 t + 1 noiseless 2 -way communication channels. Their goal is to communicate privately and reliably, {{despite the presence of}} an adversary that may actively corrupt at most t of those channels. These properties should hold information theoretically and without error. We propose an asymptotically optimal solution for this problem. The proposed protocol consists of two communication rounds, and a total of O(ℓn) bits are exchanged in order to transmit a message of ℓ bits. Earlier, at CRYPTO 2004, an equally optimal solution has been claimed. However, we give a counter-example showing that their result is not perfectly reliable. The flaw seems to be fundamental and non-trivial to repair. Our approach is overall entirely different, yet it also makes essential use of their neat communication efficient technique for reliably transmitting conflict graphs. What distinguishes our approach from previous ones is a technique that allows to identify all actively corrupted channels, initially trading it off against privacy. A perfectly secure and reliable secret key is then distilled by privacy amplification...|$|R

In addition, by using receiver’s public key pk, each sender Si wants to divide a message mi to y shares, and then to distribute a part of y shares to each servers. Furthermore we develop with a variant of the Paillier encryption function which has several properties related to homomorphism [3].
