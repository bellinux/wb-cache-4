Results indicated that the polyester/cotton core-spun thread produced seams with greater breaking strength and elongation than mercerized cotton thread for all comparable sets of specimens. Seams constructed with polyester/cotton core-spun thread also tended to exhibit greater <b>seam</b> breaking <b>strength</b> and elongation than those seamed with bonded nylon monocord thread. The nylon thread, in turn, tended to produce stronger and more extensible seams than did mercerized cotton thread. The elastic straight stitch (a triple lockstitch) produced seams with greater breaking strength and elongation than either of the other stitch types. Most seams stitched with the lockstitch with stretch had a higher mean <b>seam</b> breaking <b>strength</b> and elongation than comparable seams stitched with the zigzag stitch, Stitch length affected <b>seam</b> breaking <b>strength</b> and elongation to a greater extent with the zigzag than with the lockstitch with stretch.

40|$|Abstract – Having in {{mind the}} complex {{problems}} of technological process of sewing, as well as general demands for seams produced in garment production, this research should contribute the development of sewed seams breaking forces. Thus, many measurements of seam breaking forces have been conducted. These measurements enable us to define optimal strength of <b>seam</b> <b>strength</b> that improves the compliance of sewed seams parameters. This paper deals with {{the influence of the}} thread type and stitch density on the <b>seam</b> <b>strength.</b> The breaking forces and elongations at break were determined by the standardized method (SRPS 2062) and fabric (tape method) according to SRPS EN ISO 13934 - 1. Fabric samples used for seam testing were sewed by seam (1. 01. 01) and stitch type 301 with stitch densities 3, 4 and 5 cm- 1. Optimal <b>seam</b> <b>strength</b> (130. 9 Ncm- 1) on the fabric T 71, {{and at the same time}} the highest strength, has been noticed at the samples with seam line in weft direction with stitch density 5 cm- 1, sewed with polyester thread 20 x 2 tex count, while on fabric T 71 that value is 115. 9 Ncm- 1.

The bending characteristics were analyzed {{in order to identify}} the flexibility of the welded areas; subsequently, the <b>seam</b> breaking <b>strength</b> and water pressure resistance were analyzed to identify the bonding strength. In addition, two types of waterproof fabric, poly-urethane (PU) coated 2 layer and PU laminated 2 layer fabrics, were used for a performance analysis, accord-ing to fabric processing specifications. The circle type showed the highest flexibility in the terms of bending characteristics that influence wearability and were followed by the wave and the straight type. In terms of breaking strength, the straight type showed the highest breaking strength, followed by the wave and the circle type. The water pressure resistance analysis found that the wave type was superior to the straight type in terms of water pressure resistance. The wave type is deemed to be a design type suitable for maximizing per-formance, provided that the issue of stabilization in the welding production process is addressed. Looking at the bending characteristics of waterproof fabric for each specification, the laminating waterproof cloth out-performed the coated waterproof cloth in terms of flexibility.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} number of {{applications}} in which the traditional sewing process is replaced by welding, usually ultrasonic welding. The joining of upholstery is an example for the successful integration of a textile welding process into a production process of the automotive industry. In general, welding is possible, if the fabrics are made of thermoplastic materials, which is usually the case for technical textiles. The joining of airbag fabrics – made of nylon (PA 6. 6) or polyester (PES) – is a potential welding application in the future. Corresponding developments are stimulated by the airbag industry due to important drawbacks of the sewing process, e. g. seam leakage behaviour, occurrence of stitch errors as well as limited degree of automation. However, the requirements on the <b>seam</b> <b>strength</b> are extremely high (tensile strength 1, 000 N/ 5 cm according to a tensile test specified by DIN EN ISO 13935 - 1) and so far cannot be fulfilled by ultrasonic welding.

40|$|AbstractWeld seam is {{the weakest}} {{point of the}} structure. Weld defects, weld {{geometry}} such as toe radius, and residual stresses, which are typically tensile in the critical area, weaken the fatigue strength of the weld seam. These factors become more important with the welding of high strength steels (HSS) because structures containing welded seams loose the benefit from {{the strength of the}} steel. The weld <b>seam</b> fatigue <b>strength</b> can be improved locally with several different methods. In this paper residual stresses of the weld area and their modifications for improving the fatigue strength are discussed. The residual stresses of the toe area are changed from tensile up to compressive stresses, which are known to improve fatigue strength, with several methods. High tensile stresses can be relaxed mechanically or thermally as postweld heat treatment. Mechanical treatments are more common especially in large structures. Typical mechanical methods are burr grinding, TIG re- melting, hammer peening and needle peeing. A new method is laser re-melting method. All these methods also change the geometry of the weld toe by improving it. This paper concentrates to needle peening (high frequency mechanical impact, HFMI), and presents some results from laser re- melting tests.

40|$|The {{process of}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{sequestration}} in deep coal seam causes both coal <b>seam</b> permeability and <b>strength</b> to be significantly reduced due to CO 2 adsorption-induced coal matrix swelling. In addition, in deep coal seams CO 2 exists in its super-critical state, which has quite different chemical and physical properties compared to sub-critical CO 2. However, to date, {{there has been a}} lack of understanding regarding the effect of super-critical CO 2 injection on coal flow and strength. The main objective {{of this study is to}} understand the effects of sub-critical and super-critical CO 2 injections on coal flow and strength properties through experimental, numerical, theoretical and analytical investigations. A high pressure triaxial set-up was first developed to conduct permeability tests under high injecting and confining pressures, axial load and temperature conditions. The developed set-up was then used to conduct permeability tests for naturally fractured black coal samples taken from the Appin coal mine of the Bulli coal seam, Southern Sydney basin to identify the effects of sub-critical and super-critical CO 2 injections on coal permeability. According to the experimental results, the amount of swelling due to CO 2 adsorption depends on the CO 2 phase state and confining and injecting pressures, and super-critical CO 2 adsorption creates approximately double the swelling effect compared to sub-critical CO 2. In addition, super-critical CO 2 exhibits somewhat lower permeability values compared to sub-critical CO 2, and this permeability reduction increases with increasing injecting pressure. Interestingly, N 2 has the potential to reverse the CO 2 induced swelling areas to some extent. If the temperature effect on permeability is considered, temperature has a positive effect on CO 2 permeability. The CO 2 permeability increment with increasing temperature increases with increasing CO 2 pressure, and the effect of temperature on coal permeability is negligible at low CO 2 pressures (< 9 MPa). UCS strength tests were then conducted for both high rank (black) and low rank (lignite) coals under different saturation conditions; sub-critical and super-critical CO 2, N 2 and moisture. According to the test results, the UCS strength and Young’s modulus of both types of coals are reduced due to CO 2 saturation and N 2 saturation does not have much influence on coal strength. The reductions of UCS strength and Young’s modulus in black coal due to super-critical CO 2 adsorption are higher than the sub-critical CO 2 adsorption by about 40 % and 100 %, respectively. Furthermore, with increasing saturation pressure, the reductions of coal UCS strength and Young’s modulus due to super-critical CO 2 adsorption become lower. However, the effect of super-critical saturation on the strength of low rank coal could not be investigated due to its low density and strength values. Both laboratory and field-scale model developments were considered in the numerical modelling approach to coal CO 2 sequestration. In the case of the laboratory-scale model development, CO 2 movement in coal under triaxial test conditions was successfully modelled using the COMET 3 field scale simulator. According to the field-scale models developed using the COMET 3 and COMSOL Multiphysics simulators, CO 2 storage capacity in coal increases with increasing injecting pressure and temperature and decreasing bed moisture content. Moreover, pre-estimation of the distance between the wells (injecting and production) is important for the injection of optimum amounts of CO 2. On the other hand, CO 2 injection causes the coal seam cap rock to be significantly deformed in an upward direction and the amount of deformation is greatly dependent on the injection pressure. In relation to theoretical and analytical approaches to coal CO 2 sequestration, a theoretical equation for coal cleat permeability under non-zero lateral strain, triaxial test conditions was developed using basic geotechnical engineering fundamentals and an empirical relationship for gas adsorption capacity in coal as a function of all the effective parameters was developed using basic statistics.
