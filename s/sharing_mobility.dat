30|$|Crowdshipping, an {{innovative}} delivery model could, {{at least in}} principle, stimulate a better use of currently unexploited transport capacity thus reducing transport costs and emissions [9]. Crowdshipping is a <b>sharing</b> <b>mobility</b> service and implies delivering goods using the crowd [35]. Paloheimo et al. [40] question its ability to reduce congestion and polluting emissions since most of these initiatives rely on dedicated trips performed using private motorized vehicles. Paradoxically the greater the success the higher its social and environmental impact due to a rebound effect that might produce an increase in travel times and fuel consumption. Therefore, when proposing crowdshipping as a possible solution one should test its environmental and social friendliness rather than assume it.|$|E

30|$|At {{the same}} time and as noted previously, AVs offer a unique {{opportunity}} to de-privatise car use through sharing [90]. This could have a transformative impact on our mobility. Even more so if sharing will be in the form of more than one individual or groups using the car interchangeably (sharing can take place temporally and spatially). Using AVs to boost car sharing has the potential to reduce environmental impacts [2, 55, 64]. Yet, this is often taken as given not considering at all any unintended consequences, especially overlooking the potentially large rebound effect stemming from overcoming the reality of wasting time while in the car (or, put in other words, the potential to use time more productively while in the car) especially when trying to find a parking space. Given that transport is the sector with the highest growth in terms of energy use and that 96  % of all transport uses fossil fuel [91, 92], fuel resources and green transport are intertwined. Akyelken et al. [93] describe a continuum that runs from car owning on one hand, through car and bike sharing, to public transport on the other—the ultimate and full <b>sharing</b> <b>mobility</b> service. The AV opens up the opportunity for new ‘green’ autonomous public transport. Building up on the use of driverless trains (e.g., Docklands Light Railway in London), this may take many different forms (see The wider context surrounding autonomous cars section) transforming public transport to a stronghold of our transport and mobility system. Hence the AV can certainly be a blessing.|$|E

40|$|The current {{transportation}} {{sector in}} the United States is heavily relied on private automobile, consuming {{a large amount of}} fuel energy and producing a large quantity of greenhouse gases. <b>Shared</b> <b>mobility,</b> such as ridesharing and bikesharing, could potentially improve urban sustainability by decreasing the total vehicle-miles, saving fuel energy and reducing greenhouse gases. This research project utilized the real-world private vehicle trajectory data of the City of the Ann Arbor, identified the potential bike trips and sharable vehicle trips, and applied optimization model to obtain the sharing scenario with the maximum vehicle-miles avoidance. The results indicate that 1. 06 % of total-vehicle miles can be reduced by <b>shared</b> <b>mobility,</b> including 3, 799 vehicle trips that could be replaced by bike trips. <b>Shared</b> <b>mobility</b> could reduce multiple types of tailpipe gas emissions (e. g., 536 tons of CO 2). Although the sharing potential is low based on the results, it might be due to the limited vehicle data and the irregular travelling pattern of private vehicles. The ridesharing potential is sensitive to the passenger’s time tolerance for dour of their trips and the number of potential bike trips is sensitive to the acceptable distance from trips’ origins and destinations to the shared bike stations. Policies and incentives to encourage longer time tolerance for ridesharing. Also, more shared bike stations could be built in the future...|$|R

With private cars spending on the average over 95 % of the time parked, one of the possible benefits of <b>shared</b> <b>mobility</b> is the reduced need for parking space. While widely discussed, a systematic quantification of these benefits as a function of <b>mobility</b> demand and <b>sharing</b> models is still mostly lacking in the literature. As a first step in this direction, this paper focuses on a type of private mobility which, although specific, is a major contributor to traffic congestion and parking needs, namely, home-work commuting. We develop a data-driven methodology for estimating commuter parking needs in different <b>shared</b> <b>mobility</b> models, including a model where self-driving vehicles are used to partially compensate flow imbalance typical of commuting, and further reduce parking infrastructure at the expense of increased traveled kilometers. We consider the city of Singapore as a case study, and produce very encouraging results showing that the gradual transition to <b>shared</b> <b>mobility</b> models will bring tangible reductions in parking infrastructure. In the future-looking, self-driving vehicle scenario, our analysis suggests that up to 50 % reduction in parking needs can be achieved at the expense of increasing total traveled kilometers of less than 2 %...|$|R

40|$|International audience—Technologic advancements {{have contributed}} to the spread of sharing economy concepts, a {{developing}} phenomenon that favors the shift from private <b>mobility</b> to service-use (<b>shared</b> <b>mobility).</b> One-way carsharing is a most recent and popular kind of <b>shared</b> <b>mobility,</b> that is growing and developing rapidly in various forms. These systems are considered to have a transformative impact on future urban transportation. Despite all of the benefits that have been reported from the use of new one-way carsharing (e. g. Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand systems), their impacts on the mobility are not certain yet. This {{comes from the fact that}} in such services supply and demand influence each other in a significant way in short-, mid-, and long-term. Also service characteristics at the level of each vehicle strongly affect the demand. In this paper methods, paradigms, toolkits and platforms used in the literature for the demand estimation of the new one-way carsharing systems, as well as their potential drawbacks are discussed. A review of the literature reveals that despite the considerable number of studies related to balancing vehicle stocks across stations in one-way systems, the investigation about demand estimation of such services for which the complex relationship between supply and demand is considered, remain very limited. The majority of current platforms and toolkits used for demand estimation of new one-way carsharing systems are based on activity-based multi-agent simulations. In these simulations several main components are not yet taken into account, which could dramatically change the results. Data detail, accessibility and reliability, high computational time, calibration and validation still remain major challenges for travel demand estimation for one-way carsharing systems...|$|R

30|$|For the society, {{the most}} {{cost-efficient}} measure for CO 2 emission reductions from transport {{is to support}} a shift from private car use to shared car use through increasing car-sharing and ride-sharing.

Both direct costs and benefits of this measure package apply to households, while companies offering <b>shared</b> <b>mobility</b> services will benefit and car shops may encounter adverse effects due to decreasing car sales and maintenance volumes. Enabling such transformation towards mobility services requires both technological innovations and changes to legislation and market regulation.

Specifically, the paper outlines a research project which aims to demonstrate novel uses of low carbon mobility solutions driven by disruptive forces which are changing the mobility landscape and providing consumers with more choices to meet their transport needs. These forces include vehicle electrification, automated self-driving and on-demand <b>shared</b> <b>mobility</b> services. The focus {{of this research is}} on understanding the factors influencing the acceptance and demand for mobility under these emerging forces, development of models for understanding the demand for travel in the age of connected mobility, and assessing their impacts particularly under scenarios of autonomous or self-driving on-demand <b>shared</b> <b>mobility.</b> The successful completion of this research will result in the development of rigorous models that provide {{a better understanding of the}} likely reduction in carbon footprint which these trends are likely to achieve for future urban mobility. This paper also provides some initial results from a pilot study on a small road network. The results showed that autonomous mobility reduced the number of required vehicles by more than 40 % while still meeting the same demand for travel on the road network, compared to a base scenario with conventional cars only. The autonomous mobility also reduced the need for car parking space (by around 58 % compared to the base-case scenario). Such an impact has a clear influence on urban form in our cities and could free up a substantial amount of land and space that can be used for other purposes. However, the simulation also showed that the total vehicle-kilometres travelled by the autonomous vehicles increased because the vehicles needed to reposition.
