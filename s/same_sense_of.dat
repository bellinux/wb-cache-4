5|$|Candaules {{shows the}} moment at which Gyges, hiding behind the door, first catches sight of Nyssia's naked body. Candaules lies naked in bed, while Nyssia undresses as she prepares to join him, and Gyges tiptoes around the door {{to catch a glimpse}} of her. Nyssia holds a piece of fabric, which forms a {{vertical}} line cutting off the body of Candaules at the top of his legs, invoking a theme of emasculation at the hands of a powerful woman. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty intended that the viewer feel the <b>same</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge. The cluttered arrangement of drapery and architectural features intentionally exaggerates the claustrophobic and implicitly violent nature of the scene.|$|E
5|$|Space Invaders {{was created}} by Tomohiro Nishikado, who spent a year {{designing}} the game and developing the necessary hardware to produce it. The game's inspiration {{is reported to have}} come from varying sources, including an adaptation of the mechanical game Space Monsters released by Taito in 1972, and a dream about Japanese school children who are waiting for Santa Claus and are attacked by invading aliens. However, Nishikado has cited Atari's arcade game Breakout as his inspiration. He aimed to create a shooting game that featured the <b>same</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> achievement from completing stages and destroying targets, but with more complex graphics. Nishikado used a similar layout to that of Breakout but altered the game mechanics. Rather than bounce a ball to attack static objects, players are given the ability to fire projectiles at their own discretion to attack moving enemies.|$|E
500|$|However, not all {{critical}} {{reaction to the}} album was positive. Neil Arnold from Metal Forces was disappointed by the album's musical direction, because he felt that Mustaine [...] "has reverted back to a more simple, less furious sound". In a brief review for Spin, Jon Young commented on several of the album's tracks, saying [...] "Public Enemy No. 1" [...] and [...] "Guns, Drugs & Money" [...] were [...] "deceptively melodic hard rock not far from Alice Cooper's early classics" [...] but also said they lack the <b>same</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor. However, Young stated that [...] "We the People" [...] should be on [...] "the apocalypse's official soundtrack". BBC Music's Ian Winwood said the album [...] "is something of an unremarkable affair. Not a bad album, but not one for the ages." [...] However, Winwood also called [...] "Sudden Death" [...] "quite brilliant".|$|E

500|$|Upon release, Prism {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Jon Dolan from Rolling Stone gave the album {{three out of}} five stars, writing that [...] "Perry and her longtime collaborators Dr. Luke and Max Martin often go for a darker, moodier intimacy à la high-end Swedish divas Robyn and Lykke Li. Perry has always {{done a great job}} of letting us know she's in on the joke of pop stardom. Sadly, she doesn't always bring that <b>same</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor and self-awareness to the joke of pop-star introspection. The album's raft of ripe-lotus ballads is larded with Alanis-ian poesy she can't pull off". Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+ and stated that [...] "Katy's superpower, now more than ever, is minting songs so relatable that their insights quickly scale up to inspirational..... Now she grasps that she's making the mainstream, not just swimming in it".|$|E
500|$|Ken Hanly {{wrote that}} the {{political}} violence in Egypt [...] "will no doubt overshadow whatever repressive measures are taken against protests in Bahrain". Ala'a Shehabi wrote in the Foreign Policy that the choice of Independence Day by Tamarod should be understood {{as an attempt to}} gain true full sovereignty as opposed to Stephen D. Krasner's Organized Hypocrisy (1999): [...] "the paradox that though there is an informal understanding that states are sovereign, they can still be subject to constant intervention". Jane Kinninmont of Chatham House said Tamarod protests would not succeed to replicate the Egyptian scenario [...] "because the army in Bahrain doesn't play the same role, and many of the security services don’t include Shi'ite Bahrainis, so you don’t get that <b>same</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> solidarity". Matar Matar of Al Wefaq said that even if thousands had participated in Tamarod protests, the situation would remain the same as long as the United States continued to support what he called an [...] "authoritarian regime" [...] in Bahrain.|$|E
500|$|Wisden's {{obituary}} described Hammond {{as one of}} the {{top four}} batsmen who had ever played, calling him [...] "a most exciting cricketer. ... The instant he walked out of a pavilion, white-spotted blue handkerchief showing from his right pocket, bat tucked underarm, cap at a hint of an angle, he was identifiable as a thoroughbred." [...] Throughout the 1930s, the public and critics regarded Hammond as England's best batsman, succeeding Jack Hobbs, and next to Bradman, the best in the world (although George Headley also had a claim). Among English batsmen, only Herbert Sutcliffe, with a higher Test average, was similarly successful. According to Alan Gibson, however, although Sutcliffe was dependable in a crisis, [...] "his batting never gave quite the <b>same</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> majesty and excitement that Hammond's did". More recently, Hammond w{{as one of the}} inaugural inductees into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame, launched in January 2009, and was selected by a jury of cricket journalists as a member of England's all-time XI in August 2009.|$|E

500|$|Basehead {{released}} its debut album, Play with Toys in 1992 {{on the small}} independent label Emigre. Vocalist Michael Ivey recorded much of the album at his home on a four-track with various friends. The album received favorable reviews and frequent airplay on college radio. Rolling Stone reviewer Kevin Powell wrote that [...] "Without being preachy, Basehead's unconventional style challenges listeners to get beyond their basic instincts and open their minds, search their souls." [...] Assembling a five-member touring band, Ivey toured the United States and Europe, opening for the Beastie Boys, Stone Temple Pilots, and Ween. [...] After College Music Journal featured Basehead on its cover, the group received attention from major labels, and signed with Imago Records, a former subsidiary of BMG the following year, releasing its second studio album, Not in Kansas Anymore. Rolling Stone reviewer Danyel Smith called the album [...] "an alternative to the benign bullshit music that floods the chain stores and commercial radio waves." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that [...] "Although it retains {{many of the same}} qualities of their critically acclaimed debut [...] there's nothing that has the <b>same</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> discovery that made Play with Toys an interesting record." ...|$|E
500|$|Of Etty's two {{original}} works {{exhibited at}} the RA in 1830, The Storm, inspired by Psalm 22, attracted little interest and was dismissed by The Gentleman's Magazine—typically a staunch supporter of Etty's work—as [...] "a sad failure". The other painting exhibited was Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed, which was to prove {{one of the most}} controversial works of Etty's career. Candaules is based on a story from Herodotus in which king Candaules arranges for his servant Gyges to spy on his wife Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Gyges is discovered and at Nyssia's behest kills Candaules, marries Nyssia and rules the kingdom in his stead. The painting shows the moment at which Nyssia removes the last of her clothes. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty aimed for the viewer to feel the <b>same</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge.|$|E
500|$|Ewan Stewart as First Officer William Murdoch: The {{officer who}} {{is put in}} charge of the bridge on the night the ship struck the iceberg. During a rush for the lifeboats, Murdoch shoots Tommy Ryan as well as another {{passenger}} in a momentary panic, then commits suicide out of guilt. When Murdoch's nephew Scott saw the film, he objected to his uncle's portrayal as damaging to Murdoch's heroic reputation. A few months later, Fox vice-president Scott Neeson went to Dalbeattie, Scotland, where Murdoch lived, to deliver a personal apology, and also presented a £5000 donation to Dalbeattie High School to boost the school's William Murdoch Memorial Prize. Cameron apologized on the DVD commentary, but stated that there were officers who fired gunshots to enforce the [...] "women and children first" [...] policy. According to Cameron, his depiction of Murdoch is that of an [...] "honorable man," [...] not of a man [...] "gone bad" [...] or of a [...] "cowardly murderer." [...] He added, [...] "I'm not sure you'd find that <b>same</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> responsibility and total devotion to duty today. This guy had half of his lifeboats launched before his counterpart on the port side had even launched one. That says something about character and heroism." ...|$|E

But let the man be beggared and the woman rich, and convention steps in and says, [...] "It shall not be!" ...|$|R

500|$|... "Suga Mama" [...] {{features}} the female protagonist offering up {{the keys to}} her house and car, and her credit card just to keep her love interest and his good loving at home, presumably {{so that he can}} listen to her collection of old soul records. These interpretations are shown in the lines: [...] "It's so good to the point that I'll do anything just to keep you home ... Tell me {{what you want me to}} buy, my accountant's waiting on the phone ...". The woman also sees the man as a sex object, asking him to sit on her lap and [...] "take it off while I watch you perform". Staff members of USA Today contrasted [...] "Suga Mama" [...] with the 1999 song [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills" [...] by Destiny's Child (of which Knowles was a member), writing that [...] "From needing somebody to pay her automo-bills, [...] now doling out the cash as a satisfaction-seeking 'Suga Mama'." [...] Dave de Sylvi of Sputnikmusic noted that Knowles sings: [...] "I could be like a jolly rancher that you get from the corner store" [...] with the <b>same</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> mischief as Christina Aguilera on 'Candyman' (2007)." [...] On the other hand, Gail Mitchell of Billboard magazine noticed that the song's lyrical arrangement was similar to that of Tina Turner's work. A remix of the song features American rapper Consequence.|$|E
500|$|The Workmans {{struggled}} with labor problems continually, needing local porters to carry gear {{for them because}} they could not carry a sufficient amount for themselves for a multi-month expedition. [...] They had to transport Mummery tents, eider sleeping bags, camera equipment, scientific instruments, and a large supply of food. The porters were skeptical of the entire venture. The locals rarely climbed mountains and were not used to taking orders from a woman, which made Fanny's position difficult. The Workmans tried to solve these problems with condescension and high-handedness. Kenneth Mason maintains in his history of Himalayan mountaineering, written in 1955, that [...] "The Workmans were, on their journeys, the victims of their own faults. They were too impatient and rarely tried to understand the mentality of the porters and so did not get the best out of them." [...] Labor problems beset all of their expeditions because, as Miller puts it, [...] "Almost alone of Victorian travellers, the Workmans had absolutely no sympathy or even common-sense understanding of the local people, into whose poor and remote villages they burst with trains of followers demanding service and supplies." [...] In her chapter on Workman, Miller argues that the couple, being American, did not have the <b>same</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> caste or class that British explorers had: [...] "the Workmans, like most of their countrymen, plunged in their enterprises headlong, expecting their enormous energy to overcome all obstacles. They were justifiably criticized by the British for their callous, incompetent behavior toward the Indians." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Caravan" [...] and [...] "Into the Mystic" [...] {{were cited}} by Harrington as {{examples}} of Morrison's interest in [...] "the mystifying powers of the music itself" [...] throughout Moondance. The former song thematizes music radio and gypsy life—which fascinated the singer—as symbols of harmony. Harrington called it an ode to [...] "the transcendent powers of rock 'n' roll and the spontaneous pleasures of listening to a great radio station", while biographer Erik Hage regarded it as [...] "a joyful celebration of communal spirit, the music of radio, and romantic love". [...] "Into the Mystic" [...] reconciles Moondances R style with the more orchestrated folk music of Astral Weeks, along with what Evans described as [...] "the complimentary sides of Morrison's psyche". Harrington believed it explores [...] "the intricate balance between life's natural wonder and the cosmic harmony of the universe". Hinton said the song evoked a sense of [...] "visionary stillness" [...] shared with [...] "And It Stoned Me" [...] and the gypsy imagery of [...] "Caravan", while working on several other interpretive levels. Its images of setting sail and water in particular represented [...] "a means of magical transformation" [...] for the writer, comparable to Alfred Lord Tennyson's poems of leave-taking such as [...] "Crossing the Bar", which had [...] "the <b>same</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> crossing over, both to another land and into death". The lyrics also deal with [...] "the mystical union of good sex", and an act of love Hinton said was intimated by Morrison's closing vocal [...] "too late to stop now"—a phrase the singer would use to conclude his concerts in subsequent years.|$|E

40|$|Polysemous {{words have}} {{different}} but related meanings (senses), such as paper meaning a newspaper or writing material. Six experiments examined the similarity <b>of</b> word <b>senses</b> using categorization and inference tasks. The experiments found that subjects did not categorize together phrases that used a polysemous word in different senses, {{though they did}} when the word {{was used in the}} <b>same</b> <b>sense.</b> Different <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> a word were categorized together no more than 20 % of the time, only slightly more often than different meanings of homonyms. Pre-exposing subjects to a polysemous relation did not increase categorization <b>of</b> word <b>senses</b> that had that relation. Finally, induction from one <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> a word to a different sense was also weak. The results are consistent with the view that polysemous senses are represented separately, often with little semantic overlap, helping to explain previous results that using a word in one sense interferes with using it in another sense, even if the senses are related. Implications for lexical representations are discussed...|$|R
500|$|Avatar {{has been}} called [...] "without a doubt the most epic piece of {{environmental}} advocacy ever captured on celluloid.... The film hits all the important environmental talking-points—virgin rain forests threatened by wanton exploitation, indigenous peoples who have much to teach the developed world, a planet which functions as a collective, interconnected Gaia-istic organism, and evil corporate interests {{that are trying to}} destroy it all." [...] Cameron has spoken extensively with the media about the film's environmental message, saying that he envisioned Avatar as a broader metaphor of how we treat the natural world. [...] He said that he created Pandora as [...] "a fictionalised fantasy version of what our world was like, before we started to pave it and build malls, and shopping centers. [...] So it's really an evocation of the world we used to have." [...] He told Charlie Rose that [...] "we are going to go through a lot of pain and heartache if we don't acknowledge our stewardship responsibilities to nature." [...] Interviewed by Terry Gross of National Public Radio, he called Avatar a satire on the sense of human entitlement: [...] " [...] is saying our attitude about indigenous people and our entitlement about what is rightfully theirs is the <b>same</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> entitlement that lets us bulldoze a forest and not blink an eye. It's just human nature that if we can take it, we will. And sometimes we do it in a very naked and imperialistic way, and other times we do it in a very sophisticated way with lots of rationalization—but it's basically the same thing. A sense of entitlement. And we can't just go on in this unsustainable way, just taking what we want and not giving back." [...] An article in the Belgium paper De Standaard agreed: [...] "It's about the brutality of man, who shamelessly takes what isn't his." ...|$|E
500|$|His {{transcendental}} signature style {{first came}} into full expression with his 1968 classic, Astral Weeks and he was noted to have remained a [...] "master of his transcendental craft" [...] in 2009 while performing the Astral Weeks songs live. This musical art form was based on stream of consciousness songwriting and emotional vocalising of lyrics that have no basis in normal structure or symmetry. His live performances are dependent on building dynamics with spontaneity between himself and his band, whom he controls with hand gestures throughout, sometimes signalling impromptu solos from a selected band member. The music and vocals build towards a hypnotic and trance-like state that depends on in-the-moment creativity. Scott Foundas with LA Weekly wrote [...] "he seeks to transcend the apparent boundaries of any given song; to achieve a total freedom of form; to take himself, his band and the audience on a journey whose destination is anything but known." [...] Greil Marcus wrote an entire book devoted to examining the moments in Morrison's music where he reaches this state of transcendence and explains: [...] "But in his music the <b>same</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> escape from ordinary limits – a reach for, or the achievement of, a kind of violent transcendence – can come from hesitations, repetitions of words or phrases, pauses, the way a musical change by another musician is turned by Morrison as a bandleader or seized on by him as a singer and changed into a sound that becomes an event in and of itself. In these moments, the self is left behind, and the sound, that [...] "yarragh," [...] becomes the active agent: a musical person, with its own mind, its own body." [...] A book reviewer further described it as [...] "This transcendent moment of music when the song and the singer are one thing not two, neither dependent on the other or separate from the other but melded to the other like one, like breath and life..." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{aspect of}} the series of books that the {{production}} team wanted to be captured in the series was {{the notion of a}} lack of specific time period or geography for the settings; Handler stated that he wrote enough for establishing set pieces, but purposely left more specific details vague [...] "in order for young readers to fill in the blanks themselves". Sonnenfeld wanted to capture that <b>same</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> ambiguous time and place, and he and his team worked to try to define a set of subjective rules of what elements could be included. Sonnenfeld brought on Bo Welch, production designer for Edward Scissorhands, which Handler considered to capture the <b>same</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> a [...] "familiar but completely imaginary" [...] suburban setting he had in mind for his books. While the production team used computer-generated imagery where needed, they attempted to avoid this use where possible, such as by using large painted backdrops, by key scenic artist John E. Wilcox, rather than employing green screen filming.|$|E
