500|$|John Williams {{returned}} to score Jaws 2 after winning an Academy Award for Original Music Score {{for his work}} on the first film. Williams says that it was assumed by everyone that [...] "the music would come back also and be part of the cast ... it would require new music, certainly, but the signature music of Jaws should be used as well". He compares this to [...] "the great tradition" [...] for repeating musical themes in Hollywood serials such as Roy Rogers and The Lone Ranger. In addition to the familiar themes, Szwarc <b>says</b> <b>Williams</b> also composed a [...] "youthful counterpoint to the shark that is always around when the kids are sailing or going out to sea. It was very inventive".|$|E

"The unique {{characteristics}} they exhibit just don't {{fit into the}} other groups of apes", <b>says</b> <b>Williams.</b> The apes, she argues, could be a new species unknown to science, a new subspecies of chimpanzee, or a hybrid of the gorilla and the chimp. [...] "At the very least, we have a unique, isolated chimp culture that's unlike any that's been studied", she says.|$|E
5000|$|The singer {{also took}} on a new {{approach}} to recording the album. [...] "Williams, who generally has never recorded his vocals until the entire instrumental tracks were finished, here found himself singing along with the all-star rock session men putting down his basic rhythm tracks. 'I think everybody agrees now that you get better results when the artist sings along with the rhythm track sessions, even if you erase the vocal track afterwards,' <b>says</b> <b>Williams.</b> Ever the perfectionist, Andy wound up taping new vocals over the finished instrumental tracks. 'I just felt I could do it a bit better than I did at the live sessions,' he explains." ...|$|E

5000|$|Jabba the Hutts {{musical theme}} {{throughout}} the film, composed by John Williams, is {{played on a}} tuba. One reviewer of Return of the Jedis soundtrack comments, [...] "Among the new thematic ideas the score is Jabba the Hutts cute tuba piece (playing along the politically incorrect lines of tubas representing fatness) ...." [...] The theme {{is very similar to}} one Williams wrote for a heavyset character in Fitzwilly (1967), though the theme does not appear on that films soundtrack album. Williams later turned the theme into a symphonic piece performed by the Boston Pops Orchestra featuring a tuba solo by Chester Schmitz. The role of the piece in film and popular culture has become a focus of study by musicologists such as Gerald Sloan, who <b>says</b> <b>Williams</b> piece [...] "blends the monstrous and the lyrical." ...|$|E
5000|$|Williams {{justified}} {{his latest}} decision {{to change his}} way of selecting music to record {{in an interview with}} Billboard in 1973. [...] "'Middle of the Road music has changed drastically in the past two years,' <b>says</b> <b>Williams.</b> 'Easy Listening radio now plays predominantly the softer new rock records, not cover versions by MOR artists. My Columbia albums of hit covers have all made money, but I feel it's time for me to move along with the market.'" [...] The magazine's editor Nat Freedland wrote, [...] "The total sound of the Solitaire LP is not drastically different from other Williams albums; pretty ballads and lush string backgrounds are still much in evidence. The most obvious differences are a new concentration on strong rhythm instrument core and predominance of previously unrecorded songs." ...|$|E

5000|$|Asked {{about the}} {{incident}} for Time shortly after bin Laden's death, the now teenage students in the classroom, Lazaro Dubrocq and Mariah Williams, credited Bush with keeping the classroom calm by finishing the story. [...] "I don't remember the story we were reading — was it about pigs?" [...] <b>says</b> <b>Williams,</b> 16. [...] "But I'll always remember watching his face turn red. He got really serious all of a sudden. But I was clueless. I was just seven. I'm just glad he didn't {{get up and leave}} because then I would have been more scared and confused." [...] Chantal Guerrero, 16, agreed: even today she's grateful that Bush regained his composure and stayed with the students until [...] "The Pet Goat" [...] was finished. [...] "I think the President was trying to keep us from finding out", said Guerrero, [...] "so we all wouldn't freak out." ...|$|E
5000|$|Before Williams died, {{he had the}} {{opportunity}} to choose an unusual chronicler. Lyle Leverich was not known as a biographer, or even as a writer. John Uecker questioned Williams about his choice of Leverich, and Uecker's recollection of Williams' response differs from that of Leverich, who later authored Tom: The Unknown Tennessee Williams"Fair" [...] is the word Leverich <b>says</b> <b>Williams</b> uttered the one time he was asked why he chose him. John Uecker, a New York director who worked as Williams' assistant in his last years, did the asking."Wrong," [...] Uecker said, in a recent interview. [...] "He didn't say Lyle was fair. He said kind. I kept questioning him over and over. He wouldn't answer. I said, 'I really don't know anything about Lyle Leverich. Have you read anything he's written?'"Then, he yelled at me: 'Lyle's not a writer! A writer's the last thing I want! Lyle will write the truth, but he'll be kind.'"And in the long run," [...] Uecker added, [...] "he was right." ...|$|E
40|$|Referendums {{have become}} synonymous with failure in Australia, even when initial polling shows great support for a {{proposed}} change. Regardless of whether the stigma is warranted, this history is having {{a negative impact on}} the push to recognise Indigenous Australians in the constitution. The figures are well known: 44 referendums have been put to the Australian people, but only eight have been passed. Professor George Williams, a constitutional law expert at the University of New South Wales who has written several books on our nation’s founding document, says that while there are structural reasons why referendums are tough to pass, there are also good reasons why some fail. ‘Robert Menzies, our former prime minister, compared it to a labour of Hercules—as being one of those impossible tasks. Even he, having the greatest electoral success nationally in our history, could never crack a referendum,’ <b>says</b> <b>Williams...</b>|$|E

40|$|With exotic {{names like}} ayote de caballo (a wild squash), friajolito (a wild bean), and teocinte (a wild {{relative}} of corn), Guatemala’s native plants seem {{very different from}} the agricultural bounty produced by farmers in the United States and other countries. But many of these native plants carry genes that may be vital to global food security. A new tool, developed by a team that includes Agricultural Research Service scientists, will make it easier to find and preserve these important plants. The tool is an interactive atlas designed to provide Guatemalan scientists and land managers with information on where these crop wild relatives grow, where they are relatively safe from habitat destruction, and which ones are rare and most at risk. The genes these wild plants contain may prove useful in addressing threats posed by emerging diseases, insect pests, and temperature and rainfall extremes arising from a changing climate, says Karen Williams, a botanist with the ARS National Germplasm Resources Laboratory in Beltsville. “Guatemala has many genetically diverse native plants closely related to some of our most important crops, including corn, beans, peppers, and potatoes. Some of these crop wild relatives are found only in Guatemala, and they have genes that equip them with survival mechanisms that may be useful to protect crops,” Williams <b>says.</b> <b>Williams</b> worked on the atlas for almost 10 years with César Azurdia Pérez from the Agronomy Faculty at the University of San Carlos in Guatemala, David E. Williams and Veerle van Damme from Bioversity International, and Andrew Jarvis and Silvia Elena Castaño from the International Center for Tropical Agriculture...|$|E
40|$|Written in 1974, Raymond Williams's Television: Technology and Cultural Form was {{to become}} for many academics, and {{particularly}} for academics who approached popular culture {{from the perspective of}} the humanities, one of the foundational texts of the study of television, the first and even the only book on reading lists, the book which introduced the concept of ‘flow’ as a way of identifying ‘the defining characteristic of broadcasting’. While, almost forty years later, many of its formulations have worn thin with over-use, Williams's observation on the centrality of televisual dramatic fiction to modern experience still has the force of defamiliarisation: it is still surprising to consider, as if for the first time, how much of our time is spent with, how many of our references are drawn from, or how much the structure of contemporary feeling is shaped by television dramatic fiction in its various forms. ‘It seems probable’, <b>says</b> <b>Williams,</b> that in societies like Britain and the United States more drama is watched in a week or a weekend, by the majority of viewers, than would have been watched in a year or in some cases a lifetime in any previous historical period. It is not uncommon for the majority of viewers to see, regularly, as much as two or three hours of drama, of various kinds, every day. The implications of this have scarcely begun to be considered. It is clearly one of the unique characteristics of advanced industrial societies that drama as an experience is now an intrinsic part of everyday life, at a quantitative level which is so very much greater than any precedent as to see a fundamental qualitative change. Whatever the social and cultural reasons may finally be, it is clear that watching dramatic simulation of a wide range of experiences is now an essential part of our modern cultural pattern. Or, to put it categorically, most people spend more time watching various kinds of drama than in preparing and eating food...|$|E
