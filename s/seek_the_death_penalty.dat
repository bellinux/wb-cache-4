25|$|United States v. Gabrion is {{considered}} a landmark case for its use {{of the death penalty}} in a non-death penalty state. Capital punishment has been illegal in Michigan since 1846.

Rachel's body was found on federal land in Manistee National Forest, allowing prosecutors to try Gabrion in federal court and <b>seek</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty,</b> a sentence that is otherwise illegal in the state of Michigan.

25|$|Despite {{initially}} pleading {{not guilty}} to the remaining five murder charges on September 13, 1988, with the agreement of his two defense attorneys, Berdella ultimately conducted a plea bargain with the prosecutors to avoid {{the death penalty in}} these remaining charges. In this plea bargain, Berdella agreed to confess in graphic detail as to precisely whom he had killed, precisely what indignities he had subjected each victim to, how he had killed each victim, and what he had done with their bodies. These confessions were given to prosecutors between December 13 and December 15, 1988.
