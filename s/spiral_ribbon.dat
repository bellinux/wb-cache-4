50|$|It lays its {{eggs in a}} yellowish-brown <b>spiral</b> <b>ribbon</b> and it {{is likely}} that the larvae that hatch out of these are free-swimming veliger larvae and form part of the plankton. Known predators of nudibranchs include fish, crabs, sea spiders and polychaete worms. There have been two {{instances}} when a sea anemone in the Edwardsiidae family has been observed attempting to feed on nudibranchs. In one attack on Nembrotha lineolata, the sea slug flinched whenever it was touched by a tentacle but oozed a great deal of mucus and managed to struggle out of reach. It is unclear whether sea anemones normally prey on sea slugs or whether these are unusual occurrences.|$|E

This article investigates both experimentally and theoretically how the chiral arrangement of liquid crystal mesogens in twist-nematic-elastomer films induces the formation of helicoids and <b>spiral</b> <b>ribbons</b> because of the coupling between the liquid crystalline order and the elasticity.

50|$|The {{mainspring}} that powers the watch, a <b>spiral</b> <b>ribbon</b> {{of spring}} steel, is inside a cylindrical barrel, with the outer {{end of the}} mainspring attached to the barrel. The force of the mainspring turns the barrel. The barrel has gear teeth around the outside that turn the center wheel once per hour — this wheel has a shaft that goes through the dial. On the dial side the cannon pinion is attached with a friction fit (allowing it to slide when setting the hands) and the minute hand {{is attached to the}} cannon pinion. The cannon pinion drives a small 12-to-1 reduction gearing called the motion work that turns the hour wheel and hand once for every 12 revolutions of the minute hand.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spiral</b> <b>ribbon</b> torcs, {{usually with}} minimal terminals, {{continue}} a Bronze Age type and {{are found in}} the Stirling Hoard from Scotland, and elsewhere: [...] "Although over 110 identifiable British Ireland ribbon torcs are known, the dating of these simple, flexible ornaments is elusive", perhaps indicating [...] "a long-lived preference for ribbon torcs, which continued for over 1,000 years". The terminals were often slightly flared plain round cylinders which were folded back to hook round each other to fasten the torc at the throat. Other Celtic torcs may use various ways of forming the hoop: plain or patterned round bars, two or more bars twisted together, thin round rods (or thick wire) wound round a core, or woven gold wire. A rarer type twists a single bar with an X profile.|$|E

It consists of infinite borophosphate helical ribbons [BP 2 O 8] 3 &# 8722;, built up from alternate BO 4 and PO 4 tetrahedra arranged around the 65 screw axes. The vertex-sharing BO 4 and PO 4 tetrahedra form a <b>spiral</b> <b>ribbon</b> of four-membred rings in which BO 4 and PO 4 groups alternate. The ribbons are connected through slightly distorted CoO 4 (H 2 O) 2 octahedra whose four O atoms belong to the phosphate groups. The resulting three-dimensional framework is characterized by hexagonal channels running along [001] in which the remaining water molecules are located. The main difference between the Mg-containing and the title structure lies in the filling ratio of Wyckoff positions 6 a and 6 b in the tunnels. The refinement of the occupancy rate of the site 6 a shows that it is occupied by water at 67 %, while the refinement of that of the site 6 b shows that this site is partially occupied by 78. 4 % Ag and 10. 8 % Co, {{for a total of}} 82. 2 %.

In the title structure, the Ag, Ni, B and one O atom are located on special positions (sites symmetry 2). The structure consists of infinite borophosphate helical [BP 2 O 8] 3 &# 8722; ribbons, built up from alternate BO 4 and PO 4 tetrahedra arranged around the 65 screw axes. The vertex-sharing BO 4 and PO 4 tetrahedra form a <b>spiral</b> <b>ribbon</b> of four-membered rings in which BO 4 and PO 4 groups alternate. The ribbons are connected through slightly distorted NiO 4 (H 2 O) 2 octahedra, four O atoms of which belong to the phosphate groups. The resulting three-dimensional framework is characterized by hexagonal channels running along [001]. However, the main difference between the structures of these two compounds lies in the filling ratio of Wyckoff positions 6 a and 6 b in the tunnels. Indeed, in this work, the refinement of the occupancy rate of sites 6 a and 6 b shows that the first is occupied by water at 67 % and the second is partially occupied by 56. 6 % of Ag and 21. 6 % of Ni.

40|$|Using both {{experiments}} and finite element simulations, we explore the shape evolution of off-axis nematic elastomer ribbons {{as a function}} of temperature. The elastomers are prepared by cross-linking the mesogens with planar anchoring of the director at top and bottom surfaces with a 90 degree left-handed twist. Shape evolution depends sensitively on the off-axis director orientation at the sample mid-plane. When the director at midplane is parallel to either the ribbon's long or short axes, ribbons form either helicoids or spirals depending on the aspect ratio and temperature. If the director at midplane is more than 5 degrees off-axis, then they form only <b>spiral</b> <b>ribbons.</b> Samples in all these geometries show a remarkable transition from right- to left-handed chiral shapes on change of temperature. Simulation studies provide insight into the mechanisms driving shape evolution and enable engineering design of these materials for future applications. Comment: 19 pages, 10 figures.

40|$|We {{study the}} paths of fluid {{particles}} in velocity fields modelling rigidly rotating velocity fields {{that occur in the}} concentric Taylor problem. We set up velocity fields using the model of Davey, DiPrima & Stuart (1968) based on small-gap asymptotics. This allows a numerical study of the Lagrangian properties of steady flow patterns in a rotating frame. The spiral and Taylor vortex modes are integrable, implying that in these cases almost all particle paths are confined to two-dimensional surfaces in the fluid. For the case of Taylor vortices the motion on these surfaces is quasi-periodic, whereas for spirals the particles propagate up or down the cylinder on these surfaces. The non-axisymmetric modes we consider are wavy vortices, <b>spirals,</b> <b>ribbons</b> and twisted Taylor vortices. All of these flows have the property that they are steady flows when examined in a rotating frame of reference. For all non-axisymmetric modes with the exception of spirals, we observe the existence of regions of chaotic mixing within the fluid. We discuss mixing of the fluid by these flows with reference to the pattern of stagnation points and some of the periodic trajectories within the fluid and on the boundary. </p...|$|R

In non-mammalian hearing organs, at least, amplification is attributed to calcium-mediated hair bundle motion [1]. In the mammalian cochlea, amplification is the remit of the sensory-motor outer hair cells (OHCs), located within the organ of Corti to exercise maximum mechanical effect on {{the motion of the}} BM and transmit cochlear responses to the adjacent sensory inner hair cells (IHCs) and, consequently, to the auditory nerve [1 - 3] (Figure 1 A).

The development of ﬂuid motion in an inﬁnitely long circular pipe with homogeneously distributed internal heat source is examined numerically. The pipe is placed vertically in the gravity ﬁeld with the pipe wall temperature being kept constant. The motion of the ﬂuid is driven upward by the buoyancy force as well as downward by an applied pressure gradient along the pipe axis. Thus, the basic velocity proﬁle can become inﬂectional and we may anticipate that the ﬂow may become unstable {{in contrast to the}} isothermal pipe ﬂow which is known to be linearly stable for any Reynolds number. We ﬁnd that the linear instabilities always occur within the region where the basic velocity proﬁle is inﬂectional but not totally reverse. Our nonlinear analysis indicates that {{there are two types of}} nonlinear solutions, referred to as <b>spirals</b> and <b>ribbons.</b> They bifurcate simultaneously from the same point on the neutral curve.
