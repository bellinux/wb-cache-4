50|$|Ice Protection {{with the}} TKS Ice Protection system is {{achieved}} by mounting laser-drilled titanium porous panels on the leading edges of the airframe. The panel skin is perforated with eight hundred 0.0025-inch-diameter laser-drilled holes per square inch. TKS fluid exudes through the panels on the leading edges of the wings, horizontal stabilizers. Fluid is also thoroughly distributed from the slinger-ring on the propeller and from the windshield <b>spraybar.</b> Secondary fairings or structures such as lift struts can also be protected. Engine inlets may be protected, as well. The fluid is pumped from a tank by an electrically-driven metering pump through a microfilter to proportioning units. Proportioning units contain calibrated capillary tubes that divide the flow to the individual needs of the porous panels and the slinger ring. One metering pump is provided for inadvertent systems. For systems certified for flight into known icing conditions (FIKI), two pumps are installed for redundancy and can be selected individually. Fluid for the windshield <b>spraybar</b> system is provided by an on-demand gear pump. One or two windshield pumps are provided depending on the certification basis. As the TKS Ice Protection system is used, any accumulation of debris is flushed out. Glycol has cleaning properties and will not harm the paint finish of the aircraft. No performance is lost from the system; only significant ice protection capabilities are added.|$|E
5000|$|A wet single-point nitrous system {{introduces}} the fuel and nitrous together, causing the upper intake manifold to become wet with fuel. In carbureted applications, this is typically accomplished with a <b>spraybar</b> plate mounted between the carburetor {{base and the}} intake manifold, while cars fitted with electronic fuel injection often use a plate mounted between the manifold and {{the base of the}} throttle body, or a single nozzle mounted in the intake tract. However, most makes of nitrous systems combined with unsuitable intake designs, often result in distribution problems and/or intake backfires. Dry-flow intakes are designed to contain only air, which will travel through smaller pipes and tighter turns with less pressure, whereas wet-flow intakes are designed to contain a mixture of fuel and air. Wet nitrous systems tend to produce more power than dry systems, but in some cases can be more expensive and difficult to install. This is due to the process of discovering, cutting, and tapping into the fuel delivery line, many of which are at high pressure (20-80PSI.) ...|$|E

50|$|Another type {{of system}} is called a plenum bar system. These are <b>spraybars</b> that are {{installed}} inside of the plenums of the intake manifold. Plenum bar systems are usually {{used in conjunction with}} direct port systems in multi-stage nitrous systems.|$|R
50|$|Glow plugs {{are used}} for {{starting}} as well as continuing the power cycle. The glow plug consists of a durable, mostly platinum, helically wound wire filament, within a cylindrical pocket in the plug body, exposed to the combustion chamber. A small direct current voltage (around 1.5 volts) {{is applied to the}} glow plug, the engine is then started, and the voltage is removed. The burning of the fuel/air mixture in a glow-plug model engine, which requires methanol for the glow plug to work in the first place, and sometimes with the use of nitromethane for greater power output and steadier idle, occurs due to the catalytic reaction of the methanol vapor to the presence of the platinum in the filament, thus causing the ignition. This keeps the plug's filament glowing hot, and allows it to ignite the next charge. Since the ignition timing is not controlled electrically, as in a spark ignition engine or by fuel injection, as in an ordinary diesel, it must be adjusted by the richness of the mixture, the ratio of nitromethane to methanol, the compression ratio, the cooling of the cylinder head, the type of glow plug, etc. A richer mixture will tend to cool the filament and so retard ignition, slowing the engine, and a rich mixture also eases starting. After starting the engine can easily be leaned (by adjusting a needle valve in the <b>spraybar)</b> to obtain maximum power. Glowplug engines are also known as nitro engines. Nitro engines require a 1.5 volt ignitor to light the glow plug in the heat sink. Once primed, pulling the starter with the ignitor in will start the engine.|$|E
50|$|Nitros engines {{typically}} use a carburetor to mix {{the fuel}} and air together, although for some applications where throttling is not required they have a simple venturi with a <b>spraybar</b> and needle valve. The carburetor can either be sliding or rotary. On a rotary carburetor, the slide is opened as the arm is turned by the servo. On a slide carburetor the slide is opened by sliding the arm out by the servo. Both are held open slightly by an idle screw which allows the engine to receive a very small amount of fuel to keep the engine running when the vehicle is at a stop. The carburetors usually feature 2 needles used to tune the mixture. A high speed needle tunes how much fuel is allowed into the carburetor at mid to high RPM, and a low speed needle determines how much fuel is allowed into the carburetor at low to mid range RPM. Turning either needle in a clockwise motion will thin the fuel mixture. Lean describes the amount of fuel in the fuel / air mixture. To a point this will make the engine run faster with better performance, but once too lean the engine will overheat, and wear out prematurely due to not receiving enough lubrication. Turning either needle counterclockwise will enrich the fuel mixture (unless the low speed needle is an air bleed {{in which case the}} opposite is true). Rich is the opposite of lean, it means more oil (fuel mixture) is entering the engine. If the engine is too rich, it will run poorly, and fuel that has not yet been burnt may start to spit out of the exhaust. The engine will run very slowly and seem to have no power and possibly cut out from being flooded with fuel. Although, being too rich is better than being too lean, because being too rich just means the engine is getting too much oil which is perfectly fine, although performance may not be as good as if the engine were lean. An excessively lean mixture can damage an engine in a short time, as it will run above its design temperature. A properly tuned engine will last a long time with good performance throughout its life.|$|E
40|$|Significant {{boil-off}} {{losses from}} cryogenic propellant storage systems in long-duration space mission applications result in additional propellant and larger tanks. The potential propellant mass loss reductions with the Zero Boil-off (ZBO) concept are substantial; therefore, further exploration through technology programs has been initiated within NASA. A large-scale {{demonstration of the}} ZBO concept has been devised utilizing the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) Multipurpose Hydrogen Test Bed (MHTB) along with a cryo-cooler unit. The ZBO concept consists of an active cryo-cooling system integrated with traditional passive thermal insulation. The cryo-cooler is interfaced with the MHTB and <b>spraybar</b> recirculation/mixer system {{in a manner that}} enables thermal energy removal at a rate that equals the total tank heat leak. The liquid hydrogen (LH 2) is withdrawn from the tank, passed through a heat exchanger, and then the chilled liquid is sprayed back into the tank through a <b>spraybar.</b> The test series will be performed over a 20 - 30 day period. Tests will be conducted at multiple fill levels to demonstrate concept viability and to provide benchmark data to be used in analytical model development. In this paper the test set-up and test procedures are presented...|$|E

Carries 130 L (28.6 Imp gal; 34.3 US gal) of sprayant in two streamlined tanks {{attached to}} the lower fuselage {{just ahead of the}} wing bracing strut and main undercarriage leg. Liquid chemical is applied via underwing <b>spraybars</b> from the lower fuselage and supported below the wing on each side by a V-strut.|$|R
40|$|Mechanism {{controls}} flow {{of liquid}} in fuel-spraying head in combustion chamber responds nonlinearly to pressure of liquid. Shell of <b>spraybar</b> expands or contracts laterally as its internal pressure rises or falls, forcing collar down or up on entry tube. Area of window formed by slots in collar and entry tube thus increases or decreases. Drop in pressure through variable-area orifice increases much more with flow through orifice than does corresponding drop in pressure with flow through fixed-area orifice. In practical terms, lower pump pressure needed with variable orifice for given {{flow of liquid}}. Principle of operation applicable to spraying heads for other fluids...|$|E

Alternative version of one described in article, "Liquid-Flow Controller Responds To Pressure" (MFS- 28329). Orifice in shell rises on {{lower end of}} pintle as pressure in shell increases. Gap forms between pintle and orifice only after pressure reaches certain minimum value. Liquid then begins to flow out from cavity in shell. Once minimum pressure for flow reached, pressure increases gradually with increasing flow. This contrasts with behavior of fluid in fixed-area orifice, wherein pressure increases steeply with flow...|$|E
40|$|Combustion {{tests of}} two V-gutter types were {{conducted}} in a 19. 25 -in. diameter duct using vitiated air. Fuel spraybars were mounted {{in line with the}} V-gutters. Combustor length was set by flame-quench water sprays which were part of a calorimeter for measuring combustion efficiency. Although the levels of performance of the parallel and circular array afterburners were different, the trends with geometry variations were consistent. Therefore, parallel arrays can be used for evaluating V-gutter geometry effects on combustion performance. For both arrays, the highest inlet temperature produced combustion efficiencies near 100 percent. A 5 -in. <b>spraybar</b> - to - V-gutter spacing gave higher efficiency and better lean blowout performance than a spacing twice as large. Gutter durability was good...|$|E
50|$|An-2SKh (Sel'skoKhozyaistvennyy - {{agricultural}}) - The agricultural version optimised for crop-spraying and crop-dusting. A {{metal construction}} chemical hopper {{was installed in}} the cabin near the centre of gravity, feeding a spreader through a 300mm orifice. The original spreader was replaced in 1975 by a standardised RTSh-1 three channel spreader which increased distribution width from 18 - 22 m to 34 - 36 m. Liquid chemicals could be sprayed using an interchangeable system which delivered chemical to <b>spraybars</b> via a ram air turbine driven regulator pump to give coverage 30 m wide. Powdered or granulated chemicals were loaded through a hatch in {{the roof of the}} cabin and liquid chemical through a special connector on the port side of the fuselage. Early An-2SKh's were typically limited to a 6,000-hour life, as opposed to a normal life of 12,000hrs, due to the corrosive effects of the chemicals. The introduction of epoxy based corrosion protection systems partly alleviated the situation, allowing the agricultural An-2s to continue flying for much longer. Five An-2SKh aircraft were converted to firefighters, from 1954, by pressurising the hopper filled with water and/or retardant and ejecting it from a nozzle in place of the dusting/spraying equipment, single aircraft were allocated to Civil Air Directorates across the country but proved relatively ineffectual.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{conducting}} the flow-field surveys {{described in this}} report was to more fully document the flow quality in several areas of the tunnel circuit in the NASA Glenn Research Center Icing Research Tunnel. The results from these surveys provide insight into areas of the tunnel that were known to exhibit poor flow quality characteristics and provide data that will be useful {{to the design of}} flow quality improvements and a new heat exchanger for the facility. An instrumented traversing mechanism was used to survey the flow field at several large cross sections of the tunnel loop over the entire speed range of the facility. Flow-field data were collected at five stations in the tunnel loop, including downstream of the fan drive motor housing, upstream and downstream of the heat exchanger, and upstream and downstream of the <b>spraybars</b> located in the settling chamber upstream of the test section. The data collected during these surveys greatly expanded the data base describing the flow quality in each of these areas. The new data matched closely the flow quality trends recorded from earlier tests. Data collected downstream of the heat exchanger and in the settling chamber showed how the configuration of the folded heat exchanger affected the pressure, velocity, and flow angle distributions in these areas. Smoke flow visualization was also used to qualitatively study the flow field in an area downstream of the drive fan and in the settling chamber/contraction section...|$|R
40|$|The Icing Research Tunnel at NASA Glenn has {{demonstrated}} that they can create a drop-size distribution that matches the FAA Part 25 Appendix O FZDZ, MVD < 40 microns normalized cumulative volume within 10 %. This is done by simultaneously spraying the Standard and Mod 1 nozzles at the same nozzle air pressure and different nozzle water pressures. It was also found through these tests that the distributions that are measured when the two nozzle sets are sprayed simultaneously closely matched what was found by combining the two individual distributions analytically. Additionally, distributions were compared between spraying all spraybars and also by spraying only every-other <b>spraybar,</b> and were found to match within 4 %. The cloud liquid water content uniformity for this condition {{has been found to}} be excellent. It should be noted, however, that the liquid water content for this condition in the IRT is much higher than the requirement specified in Part 25 Appendix O...|$|E
40|$|A quick {{activating}} closure {{and handling}} system, which utilizes conical sections for locking, {{was developed to}} allow quick access to the combustor internal components of the 8 ft High Temperature Tunnel. These critical components include the existing methane <b>spraybar,</b> a transpiration cooled nozzle and the new liquid oxygen (LOX) injection system housed within the combustor. A substantial cost savings will be realized once the mechanism is installed since it will substantially reduce the access time and increase the time available for conducting wind tunnel tests. A need exists for more frequent inspections when the wind tunnel operates at the more severe conditions generated by using LOX in the combustor. A loads analysis and a structural (finite element) analysis were conducted to verify that the new closure system {{is compatible with the}} existing pressure shell. In addition, strain gages were placed on the pressure vessel to verify how the pressure shell reacts to transient pressure loads. A scale model of the new closure system was built to verify the operation of the conical sections in the locking mechanisms...|$|E
