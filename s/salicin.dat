5|$|In the 19th century, as {{the young}} {{discipline}} of organic chemistry began to grow in Europe, scientists attempted to isolate and purify the active components of many medicines, including willow bark. After unsuccessful attempts by Italian chemists Brugnatelli and Fontana in 1826, Joseph Buchner obtained relatively pure <b>salicin</b> crystals in 1828; the following year, Henri Leroux developed another procedure for extracting modest yields of <b>salicin.</b> In 1834, Swiss pharmacist Johann Pagenstecher discovered {{what he thought was}} a new pain-reducing substance, isolated from the common remedy of meadowsweet (Spiraea ulmaria). By 1838, Italian chemist Raffaele Piria found a method of obtaining a more potent acid form of willow extract, which he named salicylic acid. The German chemist who had been working to identify the Spiraea extract, Karl Jacob Löwig, soon realized that it was in fact the same salicylic acid that Piria had found.|$|E
5|$|Salicylate medicines—including <b>salicin,</b> {{salicylic}} acid, {{and sodium}} salicylate— were difficult and wasteful to extract from plants, and in 1860 Hermann Kolbe {{worked out a}} way to synthesize salicylic acid. Throughout the late 1800s use of salicylates grew considerably, and physicians increasingly knew what to expect from these medicines: reduction of pain, fever, and inflammation. However, the unpleasant side effects, particularly gastric irritation, limited their usefulness, as did their intense bitterness. By the 1880s, the German chemical industry, jump-started by the lucrative development of dyes from coal tar, was branching out to investigate the potential of new tar-derived medicines. The turning point was the advent of Kalle & Company's Antifebrine, the branded version of the well-known dye derivative acetanilide—the fever-reducing properties of which were discovered by accident in 1886. Antifebrine's success inspired Carl Duisberg, the head of research at the small dye firm Friedrich Bayer & Company, to start a systematic search for other chemical fever-reducers. Bayer chemists soon developed Phenacetin, followed by the sedatives Sulfonal and Trional.|$|E
5|$|The major {{turning point}} for {{salicylate}} medicines came in 1763, when a letter from English chaplain Edward Stone was read {{at a meeting of}} the Royal Society, describing the dramatic power of willow bark extract to cure ague—an ill-defined constellation of symptoms, including intermittent fever, pain, and fatigue, that primarily referred to malaria. Inspired by the doctrine of signatures to search for a treatment for agues near the brackish waters that were known to cause it, Stone had tasted the bark of a willow tree in 1758 and noticed an astringency reminiscent of the standard—and expensive—ague cure of Peruvian bark. He collected, dried, and powdered a substantial amount of willow bark, and over the next five years tested it on a number of people sick with fever and agues. In his letter, Stone reported consistent success, describing willow extract's effects as identical to Peruvian bark, though a little less potent. (In fact, the active ingredient of Peruvian bark was quinine, which attacked the infectious cause of malaria, while the active ingredient of willow extract, <b>salicin,</b> relieved the symptoms of malaria but could not cure it.) Stone's letter (mistakenly attributed to Edmund rather than Edward Stone) was printed in Philosophical Transactions, and by the end of the 18th century willow was gaining popularity as an inexpensive substitute for Peruvian bark.|$|E
25|$|The active extract of the bark, called <b>salicin,</b> {{after the}} Latin {{name for the}} white willow (Salix alba), was {{isolated}} and named by the German chemist Johann Andreas Buchner in 1828. A larger amount of the substance was isolated in 1829 by Henri Leroux, a French pharmacist. Raffaele Piria, an Italian chemist, was able to convert the substance into a sugar and a second component, which on oxidation becomes salicylic acid.|$|E
25|$|Salicylic acid (from Latin salix, willow tree) is a {{lipophilic}} monohydroxybenzoic acid, {{a type of}} phenolic acid, and a beta hydroxy acid (BHA). It has {{the formula}} C7H6O3. This colorless crystalline organic acid is widely used in organic synthesis and functions as a plant hormone. It {{is derived from the}} metabolism of <b>salicin.</b> In addition to serving as an important active metabolite of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), which acts in part as a prodrug to salicylic acid, it is probably best known for its use as a key ingredient in topical anti-acne products. The salts and esters of salicylic acid are known as salicylates.|$|E
25|$|European beavers (Castor fiber) were {{eventually}} hunted nearly to extinction {{in part for}} the production of castoreum, which was used as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic. Castoreum was described in the 1911 British Pharmaceutical Codex for use in dysmenorrhea and hysterical conditions (i.e. pertaining to the womb), for raising blood pressure and increasing cardiac output. The activity of castoreum has been credited to the accumulation of <b>salicin</b> from willow trees in the beaver's diet, which is transformed to salicylic acid and has an action very similar to aspirin. Castoreum continues to be used in perfume production.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, Kluyver and van Niel {{coined the}} genus Sporobolomyces and {{classified}} {{it under the}} Basidiomycota. They recognized that the yeast phase produced by Sporobolomyces exhibited the same forcible discharge mechanism as the basidiospores of the Basidiomycota. They therefore hypothesized that the asexual ballistoconidia of Sporobolomyces are homologues with the basidiospores of the Basidiomycota. Their hypothesis however was questioned by many who did not consider the asexual nature of the ballistoconidia as a basidiomycetous trait. Its classification as a basidiomycetous yeast was further demonstrated by Nyland (1949) {{with the discovery of}} its teleomorph; the genus Sporidiobolus. The teleomorph presented basidiomycetous traits such as the presence of dikaryotic hyphae with clamp connections and the formation of resting spores known as teliospores. In the past, Sporidiobolus salmonicolor was thought to be conspecific with Sporidiobolus johnsonii; however it is now well established that they are distinct taxa. Sporidiobolus salmonicolor is distinguished from S.johnsonii by the absence in the former of assimilation of maltose, methyl-a-D-glucoside, cellobiose or <b>salicin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Leaf beetles {{produce a}} {{spectrum}} of chemicals for their protection from predators. In {{the case of the}} subtribe Chrysomelina (Chrysomelinae), all live stages are protected by the occurrence of isoxazolin-5-one derived glucosides that partially contain esters of 3-nitropropanoic acid (3-NPA, beta-nitropropionic acid). The latter compound is an irreversible inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase. Hence, 3-NPA inhibits the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This inhibition leads to neurodegeneration with symptoms similar to those caused by Huntington's disease. [...] Since leaf beetles produce high concentrations of 3-NPA esters, a powerful chemical defense against a wide range of different predators is obvious. The larvae of Chrysomelina leaf beetles developed a second defensive strategy that is based on the excretion of droplets via pairs of defensive glands {{at the back of the}} insects. These droplets are immediately presented after mechanical disturbance and contain volatile compounds that derive from sequestered plant metabolites. Due to the specialization of leaf beetles to a certain host plant, the composition of the larval secretion is species-dependent. For instance, the red poplar leaf beetle (Chrysomela populi) consumes the leaves of poplar plants, which contain <b>salicin.</b> This compound is taken up by the insect and then further transformed biochemically into salicylaldehyde, an odor very similar to benzaldehyde. The presence of <b>salicin</b> and salicylaldehyde can repel potential predators of leaf beetles.|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the oldest}} natural product based drugs are analgesics. The bark of the willow tree has been known from antiquity to have pain {{relieving}} properties. This is due to presence of the natural product <b>salicin</b> which in turn may be hydrolyzed into salicylic acid. [...] A synthetic derivative acetylsalicylic acid better known as aspirin is a widely used pain reliever. [...] Its mechanism of action is inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme. Another notable example is opium is extracted from the latex from Papaver somniferous (a flowering poppy plant). The most potent narcotic component of opium is the alkaloid morphine which acts as an opioid receptor agonist. [...] A more recent example is the N-type calcium channel blocker ziconotide analgesic {{which is based on}} a cyclic peptide cone snail toxin (ω-conotoxin MVIIA) from the species Conus magus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Salicin</b> is an {{alcoholic}} β-glucoside. <b>Salicin</b> {{is produced in}} (and named after) willow (Salix) bark and acts as an anti-inflammatory agent in the human body. <b>Salicin</b> is also commonly found in the bark of Populus species, and the leaves of willows and poplars. It {{is also found in}} castoreum, which was used as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic. The activity of castoreum has been credited to the accumulation of <b>salicin</b> from willow trees in the beaver's diet, which is transformed to salicylic acid and has an action very similar to aspirin. <b>Salicin</b> was the historical origin of aspirin and is chemically related to it. When consumed, the acetalic ether bridge is broken down. The two parts of the molecule, glucose and salicyl alcohol, then are metabolized separately. By oxidizing the alcohol function the aromatic part finally is metabolized to salicylic acid. <b>Salicin</b> tastes bitter like quinine.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} an {{alcoholic}} glycoside is <b>salicin,</b> which {{is found in the}} genus salix. <b>Salicin</b> is converted in the body into salicylic acid, which is closely related to aspirin and has analgesic, antipyretic, and antiinflammatory effects.|$|E
50|$|Salix serpyllifolia {{contains}} <b>salicin,</b> {{the source}} of salicylic acid in aspirin.|$|E
50|$|The active extract of the bark, called <b>salicin,</b> {{after the}} Latin name Salix, was {{isolated}} to its crystalline form in 1828 by Henri Leroux, a French pharmacist, and Raffaele Piria, an Italian chemist, who then succeeded in separating out the acid in its pure state. Salicylic acid, like aspirin, is a chemical derivative of <b>salicin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Like other willows, it {{contains}} <b>salicin,</b> {{and was used}} by Native Americans as a painkiller.|$|E
50|$|The active {{components}} include scopoletin, aesculetin, <b>salicin,</b> 1-methyl-2,3 clibutyl hemimellitate, and viburnin. Tannin is another chemical component of black haw.|$|E
50|$|Thus, the two {{substrates}} of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and salicyl alcohol, whereas its two {{products are}} UDP and <b>salicin.</b>|$|E
50|$|He is {{credited}} with isolating <b>salicin</b> from willow bark (1828) and the discovery of berberine (from the root bark of Berberis vulgaris).|$|E
50|$|By hydrolysis, <b>salicin</b> {{releases}} glucose and salicylic alcohol {{which can}} be converted into salicylic acid, both in vivo and through chemical methods. The acid {{is more effective than}} <b>salicin</b> and, in addition to its fever-reducing properties, is anti-inflammatory and analgesic. In 1869, Hermann Kolbe synthesised salicylate, although it was too acidic for the gastric mucosa. The reaction used to synthesise aromatic acid from a phenol in the presence of CO2 is known as the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction.|$|E
50|$|Mild {{side effects}} are standard, with rare occurrences of nausea, vomiting, rash, {{dizziness}} and breathing problems. Overdose from high quantities of <b>salicin</b> can be toxic, damaging kidneys, causing stomach ulcers, diarrhea, bleeding or digestive discomfort. Some {{people may be}} allergic or sensitive to salicylates and suffer reactions similar to those produced by aspirin. People should not take <b>salicin</b> if they have asthma, diabetes, gout, gastritis, hemophilia, stomach ulcers; also contraindicated are children under 16, and pregnant and breastfeeding women.|$|E
50|$|Salicyl alcohol (saligenin) is {{precursor}} of salicylic acid and is formed from <b>salicin</b> by enzymatic hydrolysis by Salicyl-alcohol beta-D-glucosyltransferase or by acid hydrolysis.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary use}} of black haw {{today is to}} prevent menstrual cramps. The <b>salicin</b> in black haw may also be of use in pain relief.|$|E
50|$|Willow bark {{contains}} <b>salicin,</b> {{a compound}} similar to aspirin that has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic properties. The following table examines why various tribes use willow.|$|E
50|$|Populin is a {{glucoside}} {{occurring in}} the bark, buds and leaves of certain species of poplar. The alkaline cleavage of populin produces benzoate and the glucoside <b>salicin.</b>|$|E
50|$|There is an East African origin {{for high}} <b>salicin</b> {{sensitivity}}, and thus sensitivity to bitterness in people from this region, with this phenotype matched to TAS2R16 variants.|$|E
50|$|The benzoyl {{derivative}} cellotropin {{has been}} used for tuberculosis. Populin, which occurs in the leaves and bark of Populus tremula, is benzoyl <b>salicin.</b> Benzoyl-beta-D-glucoside is a compound found in Pteris ensiformis.|$|E
50|$|Both tannin and <b>salicin</b> can be {{extracted}} from goat willow bark. The tree {{is not considered}} {{a good source of}} timber, as its wood is both brittle and known to crackle violently if burned.|$|E
50|$|He {{carried out}} {{research}} into the effect of <b>salicin,</b> an extract from willow bark and a known anti-rheumatic treatment. This work was followed by Carl Thiersch, and in 1874 salicylic acid was synthesised, the active ingredient in Aspirin.|$|E
5000|$|Type II prodrugs are bioactivated outside cells (extracellularly), {{especially}} in digestive fluids {{or in the}} body's circulatory system, particularly in the blood. Examples of Type II prodrugs are <b>salicin</b> (described above) and certain antibody-, gene- or virus-directed enzyme prodrugs used in chemotherapy or immunotherapy.|$|E
50|$|The species {{produces}} acid aerobically from glucose (without gas), fructose, sucrose, trehalose, turanose, xylose, and glycerol. No acid {{is produced}} from adonitol, arabinose, arbutin, cellobiose, dulcitol, fucose, galactose, inositol, inulin, lactose, maltose, mannitol, mannose, melezitose, melibiose, raffinose, rhamnose, ribose, <b>salicin,</b> sorbose, or tagatose. It normally weakly produces acid anaerobically from glucose.|$|E
50|$|Though Pelouze made no {{discovery}} of outstanding importance, {{he was a}} busy investigator, his work including researches on <b>salicin,</b> on beetroot sugar, on various organic acids (gallic, malic, tartaric, butyric, lactic, etc.), on oenanthic ether (with Liebig), on the nitrosulphates, on guncotton, and on the composition and manufacture of glass.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemicals}} in black haw do relax the uterus and therefore probably prevent miscarriage; however, the <b>salicin</b> may be teratogenic. Consequently, pregnant women should not use black haw {{in the first}} two trimesters. Furthermore, anyone using herbs for medical reasons should only use them under the supervision of a qualified medical professional.|$|E
50|$|From {{the era of}} Greek {{medicine}} to the mid-19th century, the discovery of medicinal agents was classed as an empirical art; folklore and mythological guidance were combined in deploying the vegetable and mineral products {{that made up the}} expansive pharmacopeia of the time. Myrtle leaves were in use by 1500 BCE. Hippocrates (460-377 BCE) first reported using willow bark and in 30 BCE Celsus described the signs of inflammation and also used willow bark to mitigate them. On 25 April 1763, Edward Stone wrote to the Royal Society describing his observations on the use of willow bark-based medicines in febrile patients. The active ingredient of willow bark, a glycoside called <b>salicin,</b> was first isolated by Johann Andreas Buchner in 1827. By 1829, French chemist Henri Leroux had improved the extraction process to obtain about 30g of purified <b>salicin</b> from 1.5 kg of bark.|$|E
50|$|B. dorei {{has been}} tested for {{numerous}} different metabolic test looking at different sugars. Growth of cells was seen via production of acid occurred on the following sugars: glucose, sucrose, xylose, rhamnose, lactose, maltose, arabinose, mannose and raffinose while no growth and no acid production occurred on the following sugars: cellobiose, <b>salicin,</b> trehalose, mannitol, glycerol, melezitose and sorbitol.|$|E
50|$|In samples {{collected}} from cerebrospinal fluid, C. koseri grows well on an any ordinary medium; they produce unpigmented, colorless mucoid colonies. If incubated for 24 hours in other media such as indole, citrate, and adonitol, C.koseri will be positive, hydrogen sulfide negative in Kligers’ iron agar, negative results in lactose, <b>salicin,</b> and sucrose broth as well.|$|E
