5|$|A <b>serious</b> <b>incident</b> {{involving}} hooliganism before, {{during and}} after a match against Millwall in 1985 caused the club's then chairman, Conservative MP David Evans, to introduce a scheme effective {{from the start of}} 1986–87 banning all visiting supporters from the ground, and requiring home fans to carry identity cards when attending matches. Conversion to an all-seater ground also began in 1986. Away fans returned for 1990–91, and grass a year later. The David Preece Stand was erected in 1991, and the conversion of the Kenilworth Stand to an all-seater was completed in 2005.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 1989, off Vieques Island, Iowas Turret One fired {{six of the}} {{experimental}} shells using the supercharged powder bags. Skelley claimed {{that one of the}} 16inch shells traveled , setting a record for the longest conventional 16inch (406.4mm) shell ever fired. Although the shells had been fired without <b>serious</b> <b>incident,</b> Meyer and Petty Officer First Class Dale Eugene Mortensen, gun chief for Turret One, told Skelley that they would no longer participate in his experiments. Skelley asked Turret Two's gun chief, Senior Chief Reggie Ziegler, if he could use Turret Two for his experiments; Ziegler refused. Skelley then asked Lieutenant Phil Buch, Turret Two's officer in charge, and Buch acquiesced.|$|E
5|$|The deposed Sultan made an {{unsuccessful}} appeal to Kenya and Tanganyika for military assistance, although Tanganyika sent 100 paramilitary {{police officers to}} Zanzibar to contain rioting. Other than the Tanganyika Rifles (formerly the colonial King's African Rifles), the police were the only armed force in Tanganyika, and on 20 January the police absence led the entire Rifles regiment to mutiny. Dissatisfied with their low pay rates and with the slow progress of the replacement of their British officers with Africans, the soldiers' mutiny sparked similar uprisings in both Uganda and Kenya. However, order on the African mainland was rapidly restored without <b>serious</b> <b>incident</b> by the British Army and Royal Marines.|$|E

5|$|The first hydrogen-filled balloon {{was invented}} by Jacques Charles in 1783. Hydrogen {{provided}} the lift for the first reliable form of air-travel following the 1852 invention of the first hydrogen-lifted airship by Henri Giffard. German count Ferdinand von Zeppelin promoted the idea of rigid airships lifted by hydrogen that later were called Zeppelins; {{the first of which}} had its maiden flight in 1900. Regularly scheduled flights started in 1910 and by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, they had carried 35,000 passengers without a <b>serious</b> <b>incident.</b> Hydrogen-lifted airships were used as observation platforms and bombers during the war.|$|E
5|$|Around 1960, ANAK held {{a series}} of secret dinner {{meetings}} with the families of Ford Greene, Ralph A. Long, Jr. and Lawrence Michael Williams, Georgia Tech's first three African American students. The goal of these meetings, facilitated through the Georgia Tech YMCA, was to discuss the range of potential situations that could arise when the three students enrolled at Georgia Tech the following year, as well as appropriate reactions to each of these situations. When Greene, Long, and Williams enrolled in the fall semester of 1961, ANAK members discreetly kept a close watch on the three students for the first two weeks to ensure their safety. As a result of ANAK's efforts and those of other Institute and city organizations, none of the students was involved in any <b>serious</b> <b>incident,</b> paving the way for continued peaceful racial integration.|$|E
5|$|During his spell in Sauber, in the 1991 Sportscar World Championship, Schumacher was {{involved}} in a <b>serious</b> <b>incident</b> with Derek Warwick in that year's 430 km of Nürburgring. While trying to set his flying lap in qualifying, Schumacher encountered Warwick's Jaguar on a slow lap resulting in lost time for Schumacher. As retaliation for being in his way, Schumacher swerved the Sauber into Warwick's car, hitting the Jaguar's nose and front wheel. Enraged by the German's attitude, Warwick drove to the pits and chased a fleeing Schumacher on foot through the Sauber pits. He eventually caught up with Schumacher, and it took intervention from Jochen Mass to prevent Warwick physically assaulting Schumacher.|$|E

5|$|The match {{took place}} in Reykjavík from July to September 1972 {{and was the first}} to receive an American {{broadcast}} in prime time. Fischer lost the first two games in strange fashion: the first when he played a risky pawn-grab in a drawn endgame, the second by forfeit when he refused to play the game in a dispute over playing conditions. Fischer would likely have forfeited the entire match, but Spassky, not wanting to win by default, yielded to Fischer's demands to move the next game to a back room, away from the cameras whose presence had upset Fischer. After that game, the match was moved back to the stage and proceeded without further <b>serious</b> <b>incident.</b> Fischer won seven of the next 19 games, losing only one and drawing eleven, to win the match 12½–8½ and become the 11th World Chess Champion.|$|E
5|$|Although Project Alberta had no attack orders, it {{proceeded}} {{with the plan}} to have the Little Boy ready by 1 August 1945 and the first Fat Man ready for use {{as soon as possible}} after that. In the meantime, a series of twelve combat missions were flown between 20 and 29 July against targets in Japan using high-explosive Pumpkin bombs. Project Alberta's Sheldon Dike and Milo Bolstead flew on some of these missions, as did the British observer Group Captain Leonard Cheshire. One <b>serious</b> <b>incident</b> occurred when a Pumpkin bomb was released in the bomb bay of the B-29 Strange Cargo while it was taxiing. The bomb fell through the closed bomb bay doors onto the taxiway. The plane came to a halt in a shower of sparks, but fire fighters doused the plane and the bomb in foam, and the bomb did not explode. The aircraft had to be jacked up to remove the bomb.|$|E
5|$|Focusyn, {{the fictional}} psychoactive drug that is {{prominently}} featured throughout the episode, {{is based on}} the real-life medicine Ritalin, which is used to treat disorders such as ADHD. Hosey the Bear, which {{can be seen in the}} beginning of the episode, is a reference to the United States Forest Service's mascot Smokey Bear. After Bart has flooded the school gym, Skinner can be seen wiping mud off his eyes in an homage to American actor Oliver Hardy. The sequence of Bart stealing an army tank and destroying half of Springfield under the influence of mind-altering substances is likely a reference to Shawn Nelson, a man infamous for a similar, albeit <b>serious,</b> <b>incident.</b> A scene in the episode shows Marge standing in front of the tank Bart has stolen. The scene is a reference to Tank Man, the anonymous man who stood in the way of a column of tanks the morning after the Chinese military forcibly removed pro-democracy protesters from Beijing's Tiananmen Square.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the five}} spans {{of the current}} bridge are far wider than the {{nineteen}} spans of the original bridge, Battersea Bridge's location on a sharp bend in the river still presents a hazard to navigation. In 1948, the MV Delta jammed under the bridge, and its master Hendrikus Oostring suffered broken arms {{and needed to be}} rescued from the smashed wheelhouse. On 23 March 1950, the collier John Hopkinson collided with the central pier, causing serious structural damage, leaving the tram tracks as the only element holding the bridge together. The London County Council was concerned that the entire structure would collapse and closed the bridge until January 1951. Tram services in the area were withdrawn on 30 September 1950, so when the bridge was reopened the tram tracks were lifted. Another <b>serious</b> <b>incident</b> took place on 21 September 2005, when the James Prior, a 200-ton barge, collided with the bridge, causing serious structural damage costing over £500,000 to repair. The bridge was closed to all motor vehicles other than buses while repairs were carried out, causing severe traffic congestion; it eventually reopened on 16 January 2006. Brian King, the master of the James Prior, was formally cleared of navigating without due care and attention in 2008, when the judge in the case injured his back and was unable to proceed, and prosecutors decided not to re-present the case.|$|E

25|$|The {{impact of}} sexual {{harassment}} can vary. In research {{carried out by the}} EU Agency for Fundamental Human Rights research, 17,335 female victims of sexual assault were asked to name the feelings that resulted from the most <b>serious</b> <b>incident</b> of sexual assault that they had encountered since the age of 15. 'Anger, annoyance and embarrassment were the most common emotional responses, with 45% of women feeling anger, 41% annoyance and 36% embarrassment. Furthermore, close to one in three women (29 %) who has experienced sexual harassment says that she felt fearful {{as a result of the}} most <b>serious</b> <b>incident,</b> while one in five (20%) victims say that the most <b>serious</b> <b>incident</b> made her feel ashamed of what had taken place. In other situations, harassment may lead to temporary or prolonged stress or depression depending on the recipient's psychological abilities to cope and the type of harassment and the social support or lack thereof for the recipient. Psychologists and social workers report that severe or chronic sexual harassment can have the same psychological effects as rape or sexual assault. Victims who do not submit to harassment may also experience various forms of retaliation, including isolation and bullying.|$|E
