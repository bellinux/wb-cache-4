500|$|While {{discussing}} the prostitution plot, Christina Hendricks said, [...] "This {{is a very}} confusing situation for Joan and for everyone involved. First off, it's just completely insulting. Second of all, it's quite an opportunity. Then all of a <b>sudden</b> <b>you</b> put the money involved or the opportunity involved or you put a label on it, then it becomes a scary road to go down." [...] Hendricks said that Joan's motivation was [...] "protection [...] her child." [...] Hendricks felt that Joan saw herself as an equal {{in a way to}} the other partners after going through with the deal, as Joan had seen them do worse things over her thirteen years in employment.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, John Dandois, Media Arts Group executive, recounted a {{story that}} on one {{occasion}} six years previously, Kinkade became drunk at a Siegfried & Roy magic show in Las Vegas and began shouting [...] "Codpiece! Codpiece!" [...] at the performers. Eventually he was calmed by his mother. Dandois also said of Kinkade, [...] "Thom would be fine, he would be drinking, {{and then all of}} a <b>sudden,</b> <b>you</b> couldn't tell where the boundary was, and then he became very incoherent, and he would start cussing and doing a lot of weird stuff." [...] In June 2010, Kinkade was arrested in Carmel, California, for driving while under the influence of alcohol. He was later convicted.|$|E
2500|$|Johnson {{was often}} seen as a wildly ambitious, tireless, and {{imposing}} figure who was ruthlessly effective at getting legislation passed. He worked 18- to 20-hour days without break and was apparently absent of any leisure activities. [...] "There was no more powerful majority leader in American history," [...] biographer Robert Dallek writes. Dallek stated that Johnson had biographies on all the Senators, knew what their ambitions, hopes, and tastes were {{and used it to}} his advantage in securing votes. Another Johnson biographer noted, [...] "He could get up every day and learn what their fears, their desires, their wishes, their wants were and he could then manipulate, dominate, persuade and cajole them." [...] At [...] tall, Johnson had his own particular brand of persuasion, known as [...] "The Johnson Treatment". A contemporary writes, [...] "It was an incredible blend of badgering, cajolery, reminders of past favors, promises of future favors, predictions of gloom if something doesn't happen. When that man started to work on you, all of a <b>sudden,</b> <b>you</b> just felt that you were standing under a waterfall and the stuff was pouring on you." ...|$|E
60|$|SIR WILLIAM. [With a <b>sudden</b> outburst] <b>You</b> have none--not the faintest, {{brought up}} as you've been.|$|R
60|$|EILEEN (angrily). What {{makes you}} so {{considerate}} of Fred Nicholls all of a <b>sudden?</b> What <b>you</b> thought about him was right.|$|R
6000|$|... “At an hour’s notice, I’m sure. Trained {{nurses are}} used to <b>sudden</b> calls, <b>you</b> know. I’ll see her to-morrow—if it’s better weather.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I expect it’s a death-warning for you, George," [...] {{said the}} voice, solemnly. [...] "The last {{watchman}} died <b>sudden,</b> <b>you</b> remember." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{all that}} {{happened}} like this? All of a <b>sudden.</b> <b>You</b> never heard anything--no warning. Nothing. Never {{had an idea}} that something was up? Come, Almayer!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not immediately. You are his {{favorite}} nurse--you must gradually accustom {{him to the}} idea of your going away. If you do anything <b>sudden</b> <b>you</b> may cause a relapse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I declare, {{this is very}} <b>sudden.</b> But <b>you</b> have succeeded. Who {{made the}} suit? And {{where did you get}} all that pretty fringe and those {{beautiful}} beads?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Chudleigh laughed. [...] "If you hint {{as much in}} public, it {{may come}} to a <b>sudden</b> end. <b>You</b> ought to know that {{promotion}} is now made on merit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me!" [...] {{said the}} old lady again. [...] "This is rather <b>sudden.</b> Still--if <b>you</b> must. Well, I'll go and see what {{there is in the}} house to eat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "P’r’aps you’re right," [...] {{said his}} friend. [...] "But it’ll {{be a bit}} of a shock to her, anyway. What do you say to me {{stepping}} round and breaking the news to her? It’s a bit <b>sudden,</b> <b>you</b> know. She’s expecting a white-haired old gentleman, not a black-haired boy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, silly one," [...] cried Raymond, [...] "what is {{your little}} head pondering upon, {{that of a}} <b>sudden</b> <b>you</b> have become so sublimely dismal? Cheer up, or I shall make you over to Idris, and call Adrian into the carriage, who, I see by his gesture, sympathizes with my good spirits." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "P'r'aps you're right," [...] {{said his}} friend. [...] "But it'll {{be a bit}} of a shock to her, anyway. What do you say to me {{stepping}} round and breaking the news to her? It's a bit <b>sudden,</b> <b>you</b> know. She's expecting a white- haired old gentleman, not a black-haired boy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gently, gently, Mr. Graham. Let {{us have a}} {{few more}} words before we accede to the {{necessity}} of anything so <b>sudden.</b> Have <b>you</b> spoken to Madeline on this subject?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When of the <b>sudden,</b> listening, <b>you</b> shall hear, [...] "A {{noise of}} horns and hunting, which shall bring [...] "Actaeon to Diana in the spring, [...] "Where all shall see her naked skin [...] ." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What's makin' you so foolish {{all of a}} <b>sudden?</b> Don't <b>you</b> think a bed on {{the straw}} in Ninety-four's house is better'n bunkin' in anywhere, or perhaps walkin' the streets {{for the rest of}} the night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{really are}} a queer person," [...] she declared. [...] "You have been playing golf this morning as though your very life {{depended}} upon it. You have scarcely missed a shot or spoken a word. And now, all of a <b>sudden,</b> <b>you</b> want {{to sit on a}} sand hummock and watch the tide." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} were not a brute, and I don't think you were a fool; but yet you were too <b>sudden.</b> <b>You</b> see a lady cannot always make up her mind to love a man, merely because she is asked--all in a moment. She should have {{a little time to}} think about it before she is called upon for an answer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I congratulate you, Francisco, for I know, {{from what}} you have often said, {{that you would like}} this much better than going back to England. But it seems very <b>sudden.</b> <b>You</b> did not know {{anything}} about it yesterday, and now you are going to start at once. Why, when can it have been settled? Polani has been absent since daybreak, engaged in this matter of the girls, and has been occupied ever since with the council." ...|$|E
6000|$|It made me somehow {{break into}} laughter. [...] "You found it so natural then--and you so rather liked it--to {{make up your}} mind of a <b>sudden</b> that <b>you</b> had been steeped in the last {{intellectual}} intimacy with a maniac?" ...|$|R
6000|$|DE LEVIS. [Looking {{from one}} to the other--with <b>sudden</b> anger] <b>You</b> seem to think--! What was I to do? Take it lying down and let whoever it is get clear off? I suppose it's natural to want my money back? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Charley, dear, that is {{the second}} time that you have almost struck me. Don't be hurt by my words. I don't mean--Heaven forbid!--that you {{intended}} it; but you hardly know with what a <b>sudden</b> swing <b>you</b> removed yourself from me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in {{the least}} likely, that I can see," [...] Peter Dale retorted. [...] "For my part, I can't reckon up what you want with us. You've gone into the House on your own and you've chosen {{to sit in a}} place by yourself. You've tried your best to manage things {{according}} to your own way of thinking, without us. Now, all of a <b>sudden,</b> <b>you</b> invite us here. I wonder whether this {{has anything to do with}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite sure; only {{a little}} sprain, I think, or twist in my right ankle. The attack was so <b>sudden,</b> <b>you</b> see, that in the hurry to meet it my foot turned over. Give me your arm, my young friend. There; {{it will be all}} right in a few minutes. How you tremble, Marion! Your nerves have {{received}} a greater shock than you imagine, and a lame man is but a poor support. Give her your other arm, Mr Miles. You are stout enough to support us both." ...|$|E
6000|$|His meek {{tone was}} a further provocation; and with uplifted chin, hair ruffled like {{the crest of}} a Shetland pony, {{flashing}} eyes, and distinct enunciation, James exclaimed, 'You will excuse me for not understanding you. You come here; you devote yourself to your aunt and cousins--you seem strongly attracted; then, all on a <b>sudden,</b> <b>you</b> rush out shooting--an exercise for which you don't care, and when you can't walk: you show the most pointed neglect. And after being done-up yesterday, you repeat the experiment to-day, as if for the mere object of laming yourself for life. I could understand pique or temper, but you have not the--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{advice is}} good," [...] the man went on earnestly. [...] "They are a rough lot down there, and hang together. You {{will have to}} do it <b>sudden,</b> {{whatever}} <b>you</b> do, or you will get the hull neighborhood up agin you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, mother, one {{of these}} days it will be realized. All of a <b>sudden,</b> when <b>you</b> think you are most secure, I shall go forth like Jacob or Esau, or any other patriarch, and take me a wife: perhaps of these which are of the daughters of the land." ...|$|R
60|$|I had on {{a rather}} sprightly young check that morning, to which I {{was a good deal}} attached; I fancied it, in fact, more than a little. It was perhaps rather <b>sudden</b> till <b>you</b> got used to it, but, nevertheless, an {{extremely}} sound effort, which many lads at the club and elsewhere had admired unrestrainedly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me tell you. I {{imagine that}} for months the matter never comes into your head, and you're {{able to persuade}} {{yourself}} that you've finished with it for good and all. You rejoice in your freedom, and you feel that at last you can call your soul your own. You seem to walk with your head among the stars. And then, all of a <b>sudden</b> <b>you</b> can't stand it any more, and you notice {{that all the time}} your feet have been walking in the mud. And you want to roll yourself in it. And you find some woman, coarse and low and vulgar, some beastly creature in whom all the horror of sex is blatant, and you fall upon her like a wild animal. You drink till you're blind with rage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, hey-day," [...] said Adam, [...] "how prudent we are {{become all}} of a <b>sudden!</b> <b>You</b> have {{advanced}} rarely in brief space, Master Roland. You have well nigh had your head broken, and you have gained your gold chain, and you have made an enemy, Master Usher to wit, with his two legs like hawks' perches, and you have had audience of the first man in the realm, and bear as much mystery in your brow, {{as if you had}} flown in the court-sky ever since you were hatched. I believe, in my soul, you would run with a piece of the egg-shell on your head like the curlews, which (I would we were after them again) we used to call whaups in the Halidome and its neighbourhood. But sit thee down, boy; Adam Woodcock was never the lad to seek to enter into forbidden secrets--sit thee down, and I will go and fetch the vivers--I know the butler and the pantler of old." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, but it comes--it must come!" [...] Selingman interrupted. [...] "You {{have the}} instinct--I am sure of that. Use your power a little. It {{will be for}} his good. Every man who neglects his passions, weakens. You have the gifts, Julia. I tell you that--I, Selingman, who know much about woman and more about love and life. You've felt it, too, {{yourself}} sometimes in the quiet hours. Haven't you lain in your bed with your eyes wide open, and seen the ceiling roll away and the skies lean down, and felt the thoughts come stealing into your brain, till all of a <b>sudden</b> <b>you</b> found that your pulses were beating fast, and your heart was trembling, {{and there was a}} sort of faint music in your blood and in your ears? Ah, well, one knows! Suffer yourself to think of these hours when he is with you sometimes. Don't make an ice maiden of yourself. You've done good work. I know all about you. You could do more splendid work still if you could weave that little spell which you and I know of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hallo, Ralph!" [...] cried Bill in surprise, [...] "that chap {{seems to}} have taken a <b>sudden</b> fancy to <b>you,</b> or he must be an old acquaintance." ...|$|R
6000|$|Rho. 'Tis {{somewhat}} sudden; {{say that}} I am coming. [Exit Messenger. Now, Palamede, what think you of this sport? This is some <b>sudden</b> tumult; will <b>you</b> along? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Fathers do not {{ask their}} children's pardon,' said Eustacie, brightly, but then, with <b>sudden</b> dismay, 'Ah! <b>you</b> have not said I {{should go to the}} Moustier again.' ...|$|R
