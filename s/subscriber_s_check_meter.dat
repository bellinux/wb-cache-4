40|$|<b>Check</b> <b>metering</b> is an {{effective}} method for measuring the losses and electricity theft in a low voltage (LV) reticulation network. Populating a LV reticulation network with permanent <b>check</b> <b>meters</b> is expensive. Electricity theft or tampering is a dynamic process. Current developments in the telecommunications industry {{make it possible to}} implement a mobile remote <b>check</b> <b>meter.</b> Data collection infrastructure and data mining software combined with <b>check</b> <b>metering</b> can provide valuable information regarding the network. Before devices are placed in the field, a study is conducted to determine the optimum stationary time period for detecting electricity theft in the area based on available consumption data in the area.

40|$|The {{performance}} evaluation of communication protocols in broadband {{fixed wireless access}} (BFWA) networks needs the accurate description of the statistical properties of the packet error process. In BFWA networks mainly operating above 20 GHz, a clear line-of-sight (LOS) path is necessary between the base stations (BS) and the <b>subscribers</b> (<b>S).</b> Rain attenuation is the dominant fading mechanism at these frequencies. In this paper, a Markovbased method to estimate the packet loss rate (PLR) performance over a dynamically, due to propagation, varying LOS BFWA channel is presented and tested against simulation results.

40|$|Model {{checking}} is {{an approach}} commonly applied for automated veri cation of reachability properties.

Since concrete state spaces (models) of timed systems are usually in nite, they cannot be directly applied to model checking. One of the solution to this problem is to exploit nite abstract models, preseving the properties of interest. The paper presents a new method of buildng abstract models for Timed Automata, based on a partitioning algorithm. Our pseudo-bisimulating models are often smaller than forward-reachability graphs, commonly used in reachability analysis.

The majority of trials have been too small to produce adequate evidence to inform policy. Despite {{the lack of a}} firm evidence base, UK primary care practitioners (general practitioners) are required to offer an annual health check to patients aged 75 years and over. Design Cluster-randomised factorial trial in primary care comparing a package of assessments (i) universal versus targeted assessment and (ii) management by the primary care team (PC) or a multidisciplinary geriatric assessment team (GM). The unit of randomization is the general practice. Methods Older people aged 75 and over eligible for the over 75 <b>s</b> health <b>check</b> and excluding those in nursing homes or terminally ill were invited to participate. All participants receive a brief assessment covering all areas of the over 75 <b>s</b> <b>check.</b> In the universal arm all participants also receive a detailed health and social assessment by a study nurse while in the targeted arm only participants with a pre-determined number and range of problems at the brief assessment go on to have the detailed assessment. The study nurse follows a standard protocol based on results and responses in the detailed assessment to make referrals to (i) the randomised management team (PC or GM) (ii) other medical services, health care workers or agencies (iii) emergency referrals to the GP.
