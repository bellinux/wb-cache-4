40|$|In {{this paper}} the Kamat-Riley (K-R) event-based Monte Carlo {{simulation}} method {{was used for}} reliability analysis of longwall <b>shearer</b> <b>machine.</b> <b>Shearer</b> <b>machine</b> consists of six subsystems; water, haulage, electrical, hydraulic, cutting arms and cable systems in a series network configuration. A shearer in the Tabas coal mine was selected as case study and its all failure data were collected and used for reliability analysis of subsystems. With negligible assumption of time to repair, a flowchart was built for programming the simulation process. The Matlab mathematical programming software was used for reliability simulation process. Finally the reliability plot of longwall <b>shearer</b> <b>machine</b> was achieved and upper and lower bound reliability were calculated. The results illustrate that the reliability of <b>shearer</b> <b>machine</b> reduces to zero {{in a period of}} 100 h. There is a 50 % chance that the shearer will not fail for the first 12 h of operation. Validerad; 2013; 20130815 (behzad...|$|R

The {{results show that the}} critical failure mode of cutting tool is electric die grinder. The crucial failure cause is that in the shearing process, the UO 2 ceramic in the fuel components is crushed into particles with high hardness, these hard material will lead to tool wear. The reliability of cutting tool is 0. 892, which can’t achieve the spent fuel reprocessing working <b>shearing</b> <b>machine</b> reliability requirements. The structure and materials of cutting tool must be improved. The parallel distance between the upper surface of cutting tool and the lower surface of the pressing block has to be adjusted...|$|R
