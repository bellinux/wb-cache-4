5|$|MAO-B inhibitors (safinamide, <b>selegiline</b> and rasagiline) {{increase}} the amount of dopamine in the basal ganglia by inhibiting the activity of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), an enzyme which breaks down dopamine. Like dopamine agonists, their use may delay the commencement of levodopa therapy in early disease, but MAO-B inhibitors produce more adverse effects and are less effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms. There are few studies of their effectiveness in the advanced stage, although results suggest that they are useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods. An initial study indicated that <b>selegiline</b> in combination with levodopa increased the risk of death, but this was later disproven.|$|E
5|$|Amphetamine is {{frequently}} measured in urine or blood {{as part of}} a drug test for sports, employment, poisoning diagnostics, and forensics. Techniques such as immunoassay, which is {{the most common form of}} amphetamine test, may cross-react with a number of sympathomimetic drugs. Chromatographic methods specific for amphetamine are employed to prevent false positive results. Chiral separation techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug, whether prescription amphetamine, prescription amphetamine prodrugs, (e.g., <b>selegiline),</b> over-the-counter drug products that contain levomethamphetamine, or illicitly obtained substituted amphetamines. Several prescription drugs produce amphetamine as a metabolite, including benzphetamine, clobenzorex, famprofazone, fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, mesocarb, methamphetamine, prenylamine, and <b>selegiline,</b> among others. These compounds may produce positive results for amphetamine on drug tests. Amphetamine is generally only detectable by a standard drug test for approximately 24hours, although a high dose may be detectable for days.|$|E
5|$|Investigations on neuroprotection {{are at the}} {{forefront}} of PD research. Several molecules have been proposed as potential treatments. However, none of them have been conclusively demonstrated to reduce degeneration. Agents currently under investigation include anti-apoptotics (omigapil, CEP-1347), antiglutamatergics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (<b>selegiline,</b> rasagiline), promitochondrials (coenzyme Q10, creatine), calcium channel blockers (isradipine) and growth factors (GDNF). Preclinical research also targets alpha-synuclein. A vaccine that primes the human immune system to destroy alpha-synuclein, PD01A (developed by Austrian company, Affiris), has entered clinical trials in humans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Selegiline's</b> {{effectiveness}} in helping people stop smoking tobacco or cannabis has been studied.|$|R
25|$|<b>Selegiline's</b> oral {{bioavailability}} is drastically {{increased in}} females taking oral contraceptives (10- to 20-fold). This {{could lead to}} loss of MAO-B selectivity, with inhibition of both MAO-A and MAO-B, which would make patients susceptible to the usual risks of unselective MAOIs such as tyramine-induced hypertensive crisis and serotonin toxicity when combined with serotonergics such as SSRIs.|$|R
25|$|<b>Selegiline</b> {{belongs to}} a class of drugs called phenethylamines. <b>Selegiline</b> is an L-methamphetamine {{derivative}} with a propargyl group attached to the nitrogen atom. This detail is borrowed from pargyline, an older phenethylamine MAO-B inhibitor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Selegiline</b> {{is used to}} {{help control}} the {{symptoms}} of Parkinson's disease in people who are taking levodopa and carbidopa combination (Sinemet). <b>Selegiline</b> may help people with PD by stopping the effects of levodopa/carbidopa from wearing off, and increasing {{the length of time}} levodopa/carbidopa continues to control symptoms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Selegiline</b> delays {{the time}} point when the L-DOPA (levodopa) {{treatment}} becomes necessary from about 11 months to about 18 months after diagnosis, which is beneficial despite not being definitive evidence of neuroprotection. The rationale for adding <b>selegiline</b> to levodopa is {{to decrease the}} required dose of levodopa and thus reduce the motor complications of levodopa therapy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Selegiline</b> is a {{selective}} inhibitor of MAO-B; MAO-B metabolizes dopamine and phenylethylamine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Selegiline,</b> N-methyl-N-(2-propynyl)-2-methyl-1-phenylethyl-2-amine, is {{synthesized}} by the alkylation of (–)-methamphetamine using propargyl bromide.|$|E
25|$|<b>Selegiline</b> also {{inhibits}} CYP2A6 and {{can increase}} the effects of nicotine as a result.|$|E
25|$|<b>Selegiline</b> {{appears to}} {{activate}} σ1 receptors {{with a relatively}} high affinity of approximately 400 nM.|$|E
25|$|<b>Selegiline</b> is in a {{group of}} {{medications}} called monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|In the US, <b>selegiline</b> is {{available}} by prescription {{but is not}} scheduled as a controlled substance.|$|E
25|$|This {{metabolic}} pathway may cause persons taking <b>selegiline</b> to test positive for amphetamine or methamphetamine on drug screening tests.|$|E
25|$|Concomitant {{treatment}} with irreversible MAO inhibitors (e.g. tranylcypromine (Parnate), phenelzine (Nardil), >10mg <b>selegiline)</b> or digitalis glycosides {{is an absolute}} contraindication.|$|E
25|$|<b>Selegiline</b> is also {{delivered}} via a transdermal patch; in {{this form}} it {{is used as a}} treatment for major depressive disorder.|$|E
25|$|<b>Selegiline</b> {{has a low}} oral bioavailability, which {{increases}} to moderate when ingested together with a high-fat meal, the molecule being fat soluble.|$|E
25|$|When radiolabeled <b>selegiline</b> {{is given}} transdermally to {{laboratory}} animals, {{the drug is}} rapidly distributed to all body tissues and rapidly penetrates the blood–brain barrier.|$|E
25|$|The <b>selegiline</b> {{transdermal patch}} for {{depression}} carries a black box {{warning about the}} risk of suicide, especially for young people, as do all antidepressants since 2007.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} that <b>selegiline</b> {{seemed to have}} a neuroprotection effect in Parkinson's disease led to widespread speculation in the 1970s that it could be useful as an anti-aging drug.|$|E
25|$|In its pill form, <b>selegiline</b> is used {{to treat}} {{symptoms}} of Parkinson's disease. It {{can be used on}} its own or in a combination with another agent, most often L-DOPA.|$|E
25|$|<b>Selegiline,</b> {{also known}} as L-deprenyl, is a {{substituted}} phenethylamine. At normal clinical doses, it is a selective irreversible MAO-B inhibitor. In larger doses it loses its specificity and also inhibits MAO-A.|$|E
25|$|<b>Selegiline</b> (brand name Anipryl) is {{also used}} (at {{extremely}} high dosages relative to humans) in veterinary medicine to treat the symptoms of Cushing's disease and cognitive dysfunction (Canine Cognitive Dysfunction) in dogs.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{structural}} similarity to amphetamine, <b>selegiline</b> has been {{classified as a}} controlled substance in Japan and thus can only be obtained with a prescription or special government license. Amphetamine and methamphetamine are illegal in the country.|$|E
25|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (<b>selegiline</b> and rasagiline) {{increase}} {{the level of}} dopamine in the basal ganglia by blocking its metabolization. They inhibit monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) which breaks down dopamine secreted by the dopaminergic neurons. Therefore, reducing MAO-B results in higher quantities of L-DOPA in the striatum. Similarly to dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors improve motor symptoms and delay the need of taking levodopa when used as monotherapy in the first stages of the disease, but produce more adverse effects and are less effective than levodopa. Evidence on their efficacy in the advanced stage is reduced, although it points towards them being useful to reduce fluctuations between on and off periods. Although an initial study indicated <b>selegiline</b> in combination with levodopa increased the risk of death, this has been later disproven.|$|E
25|$|Several {{molecules}} {{have been}} proposed as potential treatments. However, none of them has been conclusively demonstrated to reduce degeneration. Agents currently under investigation include antiapoptotics (omigapil, CEP-1347), antiglutamatergics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (<b>selegiline,</b> rasagiline), promitochondrials (coenzyme Q10, creatine), calcium channel blockers (isradipine) and growth factors (GDNF). Preclinical research also targets alpha-synuclein.|$|E
25|$|For {{all human}} uses and all forms, <b>selegiline</b> is {{pregnancy}} category C, meaning that caution {{is in order}} because studies in pregnant laboratory animals have shown an adverse effect on the fetus {{and there are no}} adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, but that the drug's potential benefits may nonetheless warrant use of the drug in some pregnant women.|$|E
25|$|<b>Selegiline</b> {{is partly}} metabolized to levomethamphetamine (L-methamphetamine), {{one of the}} two enantiomers of methamphetamine, in vivo. While these {{metabolites}} may contribute to the drug's ability to inhibit reuptake of the neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine, they have also been associated with orthostatic hypotension and hallucinations in some people. A newer antiparkinson MAO-B inhibitor, rasagiline, metabolizes into 1(R)-aminoindan which has no amphetamine-like characteristics.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to potentially toxic amphetamine metabolites caused by <b>selegiline,</b> another promising treatment is in MAO B propargyl amine inhibitor rasagiline (N-propargyl-1-R-aminoindan, Azilect((R))). The oral bioavailability of rasagiline is 35%, it reaches T(max) after 0.5–1.0 hours and its half-life is 1.5–3.5 hours. Rasagiline undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism primarily by cytochrome P450 type 1A2 (CYP1A2). Rasagiline is initiated at 1-mg once-daily dose as monotherapy in early PD patients and at 0.5–1.0mg once-daily as adjunctive to levodopa in advanced PD patients.|$|E
25|$|Pethidine {{has serious}} {{interactions}} {{that can be}} dangerous with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., furazolidone, isocarboxazid, moclobemide, phenelzine, procarbazine, <b>selegiline,</b> tranylcypromine). Such patients may suffer agitation, delirium, headache, convulsions, and/or hyperthermia. Fatal interactions have been reported including the death of Libby Zion. It {{is thought to be}} caused by an increase in cerebral serotonin concentrations. It is probable that pethidine can also interact with a number of other medications, including muscle relaxants, some antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and ethanol.|$|E
25|$|Sibutramine has {{a number}} of {{clinically}} significant interactions. The concomitant use of sibutramine and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs, such as <b>selegiline)</b> is not indicated, as it may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a somewhat rare but serious adverse drug reaction. Sibutramine should not be taken within two weeks of stopping or starting an MAOI. Taking both sibutramine and certain medications used in the treatment of migraines—such as ergolines and triptans—as well as opioids, may also increase the risk for serotonin syndrome, as may the use of more than one serotonin reuptake inhibitor at the same time.|$|E
25|$|Mesuximide {{increases}} plasma {{levels of}} phenobarbital in primidone users, both primidone and phenobarbital accelerate the metabolism of carbamazepine via CYP3A4, and lamotrigine's apparent clearance is increased by primidone. In {{addition to being}} an inducer of CYP3A4, {{it is also an}} inducer of CYP1A2, which causes it to interact with substrates such as fluvoxamine, clozapine, olanzapine, and tricyclic antidepressants. It also interacts with CYP2B6 substrates such as bupropion, efavirenz, promethazine, <b>selegiline,</b> and sertraline; CYP2C8 substrates such as amiodarone, paclitaxel, pioglitazone, repaglinide, and rosiglitazone; and CYP2C9 substrates such as bosentan, celecoxib, dapsone, fluoxetine, glimepiride, glipizide, losartan, montelukast, nateglinide, paclitaxel, phenytoin, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, warfarin, and zafirlukast. It also interacts with estrogens.|$|E
25|$|Cushing's syndrome, {{also known}} as hyperadrenocorticism, is {{characterized}} {{by an increase in}} glucocorticoids secreted by the adrenal glands. About 85 percent of cases are caused by a tumor in the pituitary gland, while 15 percent are caused by an adrenal tumor. The pituitary gland produces a hormone that signals the adrenal gland to produce cortisol; a tumor can cause it to produce the adrenal-stimulating hormone even when it is not needed. Signs include increased appetite, increased drinking and urination, a pot-bellied appearance, muscle weakness, and lethargy. Cushing's can be caused by overuse of steroid medications; in some cases, stopping the medication is enough to solve the problem. Diagnosis can be difficult as there are no tests with both high sensitivity and specificity.Treatments inclulde mitotane, trilostane, ketoconazole, or <b>selegiline.</b> Surgery is used in some cases of adrenal tumors.|$|E
25|$|The on-off {{phenomenon}} {{is an almost}} invariable consequence of sustained levodopa treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease. Phases of immobility and incapacity associated with depression alternate with jubilant thaws. Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors are involved in its pathogenesis, but evidence is presented to indicate the importance of levodopa handling has been underestimated and progressive reduction in the storage capacity of surviving nigrostriatal dopamine terminals is not a critical factor. Redistribution of levodopa dosage which may mean smaller, more frequent doses, or larger less frequent increments, may be helpful in controlling oscillations in some patients. Dietary protein restriction {{and the use of}} <b>selegiline</b> hydrochloride and bromocriptine may also temporarily improve motor fluctuations. New approaches to management include the use of subcutaneous apomorphine, controlled-release preparations of levodopa with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor and the continuous intraduodenal administration of levodopa.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, Knoll {{showed that}} <b>selegiline</b> {{selectively}} inhibits the B-isoform of monoamine oxidase (MAO-B) and proposed {{that it is}} unlikely to cause the infamous [...] "cheese effect" [...] (hypertensive crisis resulting from consuming foods containing tyramine) that occurs with non-selective MAO inhibitors. A few years later, two Parkinson's disease researchers based in Vienna, Peter Riederer and Walther Birkmayer, realized that <b>selegiline</b> could be useful in Parkinson's disease. One of their colleagues, Prof. Moussa B.H. Youdim, visited Knoll in Budapest and took <b>selegiline</b> from him to Vienna. In 1975, Birkmayer's group published the first paper on the effect of <b>selegiline</b> in Parkinson's disease.|$|E
