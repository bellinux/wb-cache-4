50|$|The {{concept of}} solar {{envelope}} was first developed in 1969. It was {{developed as a}} framework for architecture and urban design at the University of Southern California. The goal of that study was {{to improve the quality of}} the urban environment by designing buildings that pay attentions to orientations. In 1976, a research was carried out by Ralph L. Knowles to further develop the concept of solar envelope as a public zoning policy. Assisted by planning department of the city of Los Angeles, the results of this research were first published in an article called Solar Energy, Building, and the Law. In 1977, to tests the solar envelope concept as a zoning mechanism, Richard D. Berry joined with Knowles to direct undergraduate architecture students in designing buildings within solar envelopes based on a presumption of <b>solar</b> <b>zoning</b> on real urban sites in Los Angeles.|$|E
40|$|The Solar Envelope is a three {{dimensional}} envelope {{on a site}} which ensures adjacent neighbors {{a specified}} minimum direct solar access time per day throughout the year. The solar envelope was developed {{as a tool to}} give buildings in an urban setting the mutual opportunity to employ passive and active solar design strategies. Parametric computer-aided-design (CAD) environments significantly ease the construction and visualization of solar envelopes across whole neighborhoods, facilitating its wider use as a prescriptive zoning tool. This study investigates the implications of a solar envelope zoning approach for the most common building type in the United States (US) with respect to energy use and developable density. The results indicate that <b>solar</b> <b>zoning</b> for this building type has a limited, and sometimes negative, effect on energy use as well as a larger negative impact on developable density. 1...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} a design tool {{that attempts to}} optimize urban energy needs through the mass-customization of urban typology. Developing low-energy, high-density urban typology is a critical goal for cities given current energy consumption and urban growth trajectories. This target is contradicted {{in part by the}} increase of building energy per square meter, required by dense urban typologies. Studies have shown that the energy impact of urban typology design is significant, due to city microclimates, and increased structural and mechanical inputs, and thus justifies coordinating building energy needs in urban neighborhoods. Despite this, current urban energy modeling tools do not account for the consequences of different typology choices and urban modeling tools do not integrate state-of-the-art environmental and energy simulation methods. Recent advances in computational tools can be used to efficiently generate a solution space of potential typologies to fill this gap in current urban design and analysis software. As such the broader goal of this research is to develop a design system that derives high density urban fabric according to a nuanced simulation of urban energy demand. Daylighting, out of the multiple energy reduction strategies available, offers significant opportunity for architectural optimization. Daylighting varies greatly, even at relatively high densities, due to the effects of ambient light, surface reflectance, and building geometry. In conjunction with the decreasing contribution of heating demand in the overall building energy budget this indicates that gains in urban energy efficiency today can be made by focusing on reducing lighting energy demand. Therefore the current goal of this research is to develop a proof-of-concept that generates and optimizes city fabric according to the conflicting objectives of building daylighting potential and urban densification. The proof-of-concept will consist of a parametric set shape grammar that is extended with existing software or algorithmic models to achieve the current goal. The tool consists of four parts: algorithmic city simulation to derive density targets, a generative rule set to encode building typology, a performance simulator to derive <b>solar</b> <b>zoning</b> boundaries and interior illuminance metrics, and finally an optimization method to identify the typology solutions that best match the current thesis goal. Daylighting metrics and material simulation is achieved with the RADIANCE/DAYSIM modeler. Existing urban modeling algorithms will be translated within the shape grammar system to map the dynamics of non-uniform urban densities. Optimization is implemented through the Galapagos evolutionary computing plug-in for Grasshopper 3 D. The thesis design system integrates research from two domains through computational methods: urban modeling and building performance simulation. The synthesis of this existing research and work thus puts forward a model of integrated city design via generative design systems. The contribution of the synthesis lies {{in the development of the}} urban energy-centric form generator, which extends procedural type generation of cities to simulated environmental and material data. The proof-of-concept is licensed under the open-source GNU General Public License, and packaged as a Python-based plug-in for Grasshopper 3 D, the visual scripting interface for the Rhinoceros 3 D CAD modeler...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe work adresses the zonation of the Atlantic Ocean {{based on}} typical yearly {{profiles}} of the downwelling solarradiation at ocean surface and its inter-annual variability. <b>Solar</b> radiation climatic <b>zoning</b> is of large importancefor preliminary assessment and modeling of systems natural systems, e. g., heat fluxes or radiation balance. Zoningcan also guide the selection of appropriate measuring stations for a given geographical location. Satellite dataoffers archives of synoptic views of the Atlantic Ocean and its cloud cover. The surface solar radiation may bederived from such images. The HelioClim 3 v 5 data set originates from a proper processing of Meteosat imagesusing Heliosat- 2 method. It offers estimates of the surface solar radiation over the tropical and equatorial AtlanticOcean every 15 min with a spatial resolution of approximately 5 km. HelioClim 3 v 5 has been validated against theThe Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA) network of moorings in the TropicalAtlantic Ocean, considered as a reference for oceanographic data. This work is a first attempt to propose a map ofthe solar radiation on the Atlantic ocean. The Atlantic ocean has been discretized {{in the form of}} a structured gridof uniform resolution of 0. 25 degree. A data set of monthly means of the global irradiance has been constructedfor each cell and is available at MINES ParisTech. For each calendar month, the monthly means were averagedover the years and the inter-annual variability was computed. A cluster analysis was applied at each cell with these 24 values as inputs to create classes that were reported into a map of the Atlantic ocean. The zonation exhibitslatitudinal trends. Noticeable anomalies are observed at South of equator. Interactions between Angola-Benguelacurrent and atmospheric dynamic through global irradiance in this area are discussed...|$|R
