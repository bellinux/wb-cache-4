5|$|Results {{of studies}} {{comprise}} another {{third of the}} core of Schizophrenia and Genetics. The data showed that genes made a person likely to develop schizophrenia under environmental pressures. The <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> designed to find the genes responsible, but the authors hypothesized there would be several acting in tandem.Contextual elements responsible could not be identified, though some, such as an overly protective mother, birth order, natal weight, and social and economic elements were ruled out. Gottesman and Shields found roughly half of identical twins had a shared schizophrenic or non-schizophrenic status, but only one-eleventh of fraternal twins had such a shared diagnosis. MMPI scales coincided among identical twin pairs but not among fraternal twin pairs. The Object Sorting Test showed no useful relations. Those meeker than their twins were more liable to develop schizophrenia where their genes already put them at risk.|$|E
5|$|On November 19, 2008, {{the police}} {{investigation}} was completed using 13,600 pages, which took 16 months {{of research to}} be produced, during which 336 people were heard. For federal prosecutors, {{the former director of}} ANAC Denise Abreu and then flight safety officer of the company, Marco Aurelio dos Santos de Miranda, should be convicted of attempt on air transport security in willful mode. In March 2006, Denise Abreu took over the management of air services of the newly established National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC). The investigation of the accident with the Airbus TAM, which killed 199 people in Congonhas, revealed that in February 2007, the São Paulo federal judge Cecilia Marcondes, who saw action restricting the landing planes in Congonhas on rainy days, received Denise Abreu one of ANAC document like a standard, but it was only a technical study. According to the complaint, the study presented as standard guarantee, in theory, security in landing operations at Congonhas airport in São Paulo. The study indicated that takeoffs and landings were forbidden in Congonhas case the track was with a water depth greater than 3mm. After the accident with the plane of TAM in July 2007 it revealed that the <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a standard and thus there was no obligation to follow it. According to the testimony of federal judge Cecilia Marcondes to the Federal Public Ministry, the document was fundamental to the Federal Court to release the runway for takeoffs and landings of all equipment.|$|E
5|$|While the {{political}} situation was becoming increasingly untenable, Playford himself continued with his job of building the state. Plans for Adelaide's future development, including a road transport plan, were commissioned. Playford saw a modern road transport system as crucial to continuing the industrialisation of the state, and motor vehicle registrations, which had increased {{by a factor of}} 50 {{since the end of the}} war, required road expansion. The Metropolitan Plan, a 1962 publication of the Town Planning Committee called for the construction of 56km of freeways and speculated that three times as much would be needed in future. However, most of this never materialised; only the South Eastern Freeway was approved during Playford's term, and construction just after he left office. A more ambitious plan for a freeway system was commissioned, but the <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> completed until after Playford's departure and was scrapped by later governments due to widespread public objections to the proposed demolition of entire suburbs for interchanges. Playford was criticised for seeing roads only from an engineering and utilitarian standpoint and neglecting the social and community effects of such building. The state's population hit in the one million mark in 1963 and the Port Stanvac oil refinery was completed. Adelaide's water supply was increased and the pipeline from Morgan to Whyalla was duplicated.|$|E

25|$|On the whole, {{anthropologists have}} {{rejected}} {{the notion that}} Mead's conclusions rested on the validity of a single interview with a single person, finding instead that Mead based her conclusions on the sum of her observations and interviews during her time in Samoa, and that {{the status of the}} single interview did not falsify her work.

25|$|Barrager {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} MSM for hay fever. Fifty-five subjects consumed 2.6g of MSM per day for 30 days. This <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> blinded and did not include controls; while an improvement in symptoms was observed compared to initial baseline, no significant changes were observed in two indicators of inflammation (C-reactive protein and immunoglobulin E levels). A double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of an MSM-containing throat spray to reduce snoring reported a severity decrease of 28% {{in the placebo group}} and 54% for the treated group. The difference was statistically significant.|$|E
25|$|The other {{portion of}} the {{parallel}} studies featured women who were post hysterectomy so who consequently {{did not need to}} take a progestin when using estrogen. They were given either placebo or conjugated equine estrogen alone. This group did not show the risks demonstrated in the combination hormone study, and the estrogen-only <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> halted in 2002. However, in February 2004 it, too, was halted. While there was a 23% decreased incidence of breast cancer in the estrogen-only study participants, risks of stroke and pulmonary embolism were increased slightly, predominantly in patients who began HRT over the age of 60.|$|E

She later became an advocate {{for the conservation of}} gorillas, and wrote several more books (mainly for children). In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Robert Yerkes and his wife Ava helped further the study of gorillas when they sent Harold Bigham to Africa. Yerkes also wrote a book in 1929 about the great apes.|$|E

25|$|Fowler's {{scientific}} {{research has been}} criticized for methodological weaknesses. Of Fowler's six stages, only the first two found empirical support, and these were heavily based upon Piaget's stages of cognitive development. The tables and graphs in the book were presented {{in such a way that}} the last four stages appeared to be validated, but the requirements of statistical verification of the stages were not met. His <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> published in a journal, so was not peer-reviewed. Other critics of Fowler have questioned whether his ordering of the stages really reflects his own commitment to a rather liberal Christian Protestant outlook, as if to say that people who adopt a similar viewpoint to Fowler are at higher stages of faith development. Nevertheless, the concepts Fowler introduced seemed to hit home with those in the circles of academic religion, and have been an important starting point for various theories and subsequent studies.|$|E
25|$|Two studies {{claimed that}} {{patients}} who are being prayed for recover more quickly or more frequently although critics have claimed that the methodology of such studies are flawed, and the perceived effect disappears when controls are tightened. One such study, with a double-blind design and about 500 subjects per group, was published in 1988; it suggested that intercessory prayer by born again Christians had a statistically significant positive effect on a coronary care unit population. Critics contend that there were severe methodological problems with this study. Another such study was reported by Harris et al. Critics also claim that the 1988 <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> fully double-blinded, {{and that in the}} Harris study, patients actually had a longer hospital stay in the prayer group, if one discounts the patients in both groups who left before prayers began, although the Harris study did demonstrate the prayed for patients on average received lower course scores (indicating better recovery).|$|E
25|$|A non-representative {{survey on}} the sexual {{behaviour}} of American students published in 1997 and based on questionnaires had {{a response rate of}} about 8–9%. Its results showed 15% of homosexual and bisexual males, 21% of lesbian and female bisexual students, 11% of heterosexual males and 9% of female heterosexual students committed to BDSM related fantasies. In all groups the level of practical BDSM experiences were around 6%. Within the group of openly lesbian and bisexual females the quote was significantly higher, at 21%. Independent of their sexual orientation, about 12% of all questioned students, 16% of lesbians and female bisexuals and 8% of heterosexual males articulated an interest in spanking. Experience with this sexual behaviour was indicated by 30% of male heterosexuals, 33% of female bisexuals and lesbians, and 24% of the male gay and bisexual men and female heterosexual women. Even though this <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> considered representative, other surveys indicate similar dimensions in a differing target groups.|$|E

500|$|When the Milken {{study was}} published, HUD had already {{commissioned}} its own study of seller-funded down-payment assistance programs. [...] It {{was performed by}} the Concentrance Consulting Group and published in March 2005 (herein, the [...] "Concentrance study"). [...] Unlike the earlier OIG reports, the Concentrance study was based largely on a cross-sectional analysis of data collected in interviews with individual homebuyers, sellers and various types of real-estate professionals in ten metropolitan areas. [...] Their findings corroborated some of the claims made by the nonprofit organizations, particularly that the typical recipient {{was a person who}} would not otherwise have been able to become a home owner. [...] But the interviewees also generally corroborated some of the claims made by detractors of the programs—that sellers were routinely raising their sales prices to recoup the payment made to the nonprofit organization, and that the price increases led to higher loan costs for the buyers along with a higher risk of default on their loans. [...] The <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> restricted to the Nehemiah Program; no particular program was singled out {{in the body of the}} report. [...] However, the appendices gave summary results of questionnaire answers from real-estate professionals. [...] These results indicated that the Nehemiah Program was the most active program in the ten metropolitan areas covered by the study.|$|E
500|$|The Payne Study and Experiment Fund {{was created}} in 1927 by Frances Payne Bolton to support {{a study of the}} {{influence}} of fiction on children. The Payne Fund Studies, a series of eight books published from 1933 to 1935 which detailed five (5) years of research aimed specifically at the cinema's effects on children, were also gaining publicity at this time, and became a great concern to Hays. Hays had said certain pictures might alter [...] "... that sacred thing, the mind of a child … that clean, virgin thing, that unmarked state" [...] and have [...] "the same responsibility, the same care about the thing put on it that the best clergyman or the most inspired teacher would have." [...] Despite its initial reception, the main findings of the study were largely innocuous. It found that cinema's effect on individuals varied with age and social position, and that pictures reinforced audiences' existing beliefs. The Motion Picture Research Council (MPRC, led by honorary vice president Sara Delano Roosevelt (mother of President Franklin D. Roosevelt), and executive director the Rev. William H. Short) which funded the <b>study,</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> pleased. An [...] "alarmist summary" [...] of the study's results written by Henry James Forman appeared in McCall's, a leading women's magazine of the time, and Forman's book, Our Movie Made Children, which became a best-seller, publicized the Payne Fund's results, emphasizing its more negative aspects.|$|E

2500|$|In the Ashkenazi {{world the}} founders of pilpul are {{generally}} considered to be Jacob Pollak (1460–1541) and Shalom Shachna. This kind of study reached its height in the 16th and 17th centuries when expertise in pilpulistic analysis was considered an art form and became a goal in and of itself within the yeshivot of Poland and Lithuania. But the popular new method of Talmud <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> without critics; already in the 15th century, the ethical tract Orhot Zaddikim ("Paths of the Righteous" [...] in Hebrew) criticized pilpul for an overemphasis on intellectual acuity. Many 16th- and 17th-century rabbis were also critical of pilpul. Among them may be noted Judah Loew ben Bezalel (the Maharal of Prague), Isaiah Horowitz, and Yair Bacharach.|$|E
2500|$|The {{object of}} <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{delineated}} by the researcher's viewpoint or interest, but the {{method by which}} he approached them could be. White believed that phenomena could be explored from three different points of view: the historical, the formal-functional, and the evolutionist (or formal-temporal). The historical view was essentially Boasian, dedicated to examining the particular [...] cultural processes, [...] "lovingly trying to penetrate into its secrets until every feature is plain and clear." [...] The formal-functional is essentially the [...] approach advocated by Alfred Radcliffe-Brown and Bronisław Malinowski, attempting to discern the formal structure of a society and the functional interrelations of its components. The evolutionist approach is, like the formal approach, generalizing; {{but it is also}} diachronic, seeing particular events as general instances of larger trends.|$|E
