40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to build}} a computer-based system for measuring <b>slub</b> <b>yarn</b> characteristics and evaluating the results using statistical methods. The measuring system {{was based on the}} electrical condenser of the Uster evenness tester as a measuring sensor. A digital storage oscilloscope was used to convert the analogue output signals into digital data to be recorded on a computer. A designed computer program was constructed using MatLab language for signal analysis based on a proposed method. Final results from this system contained graphical plots for the three measured <b>slub</b> <b>yarn</b> geometrical parameters slub length, slub distance, and slub thickness and a final report for all the measured <b>slub</b> <b>yarn</b> characteristics. The results of tested <b>slub</b> <b>yarn</b> samples showed that actual slub geometrical parameters differ from nominal values and the difference had two level: prevailing difference and outlier values. Outliers which are considered <b>slub</b> <b>yarn</b> defects were detected and counted in a final report using the box plot statistical method which could be an effective industrial tool for evaluation of both yarn quality and machine performance. The prevailing difference was assessed using histogram comparison which could help in adjusting the setting of <b>slub</b> <b>yarn</b> device to obtain the required appearance...|$|E
40|$|Strength and {{elongation}} have a {{great effect}} on <b>slub</b> <b>yarn</b> performance in production and usage. The main {{aim of this study}} is to determine the statistically significant descriptive parameters that have an effect on the breaking force and elongation of <b>slub</b> <b>yarn</b> using the full factorial design method. In addition, the effects of the significant parameters on the breaking force and elongation were investigated. <b>Slub</b> <b>yarn</b> samples were produced by using a ring spinning frame on which an original slub attachment was designed and mounted. After the samples were produced, dimensional measurements and image analysis were made. Then quality tests were applied to all samples and the results analysed. As a re-sult, the parameters that have an effect on the breaking force of the <b>slub</b> <b>yarn</b> samples were obtained as the slub length, slub distance and base yarn count. The parameters affecting the breaking elongation of the <b>slub</b> <b>yarn</b> samples were obtained as the slub multiplier, base yarn count and twist coefficient. The relationship between the breaking force and elonga-tion and the parameters selected have been explained by statistically significant regression equations. It is concluded that slub pattern parameters should also be considered for slu...|$|E
40|$|Yarn {{quality is}} an {{essential}} concept defined by customer which requests the satisfaction of several properties simultaneously. The objective {{of this study is}} to optimize <b>Slub</b> <b>yarn</b> quality and then predict it. The approach used to characterize <b>Slub</b> <b>yarn</b> quality is the desirability functions. The present method allowed us to qualify yarn quality by an index belonging to the interval [0, 1] which includes the major physical properties of cotton <b>Slub</b> <b>yarn.</b> Each yarn response is to be maximized, minimized or targeted. These goals have contributed to get a better yarn quality representation. The second step of this study involves the prediction of the overall yarn quality with the consideration of the construction parameters by using artificial neural networks. The artificial neural network is trained to foresee only one response which is the <b>Slub</b> <b>yarn</b> quality index that includes all yarn responses. The definition of the yarn quality can be modified according to customer demands. The model elaborated has presented a good performance and flexibility...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{investigation}} of two different approaches for the extraction of images of <b>slub</b> <b>yarns</b> from woven fabrics (slub extraction) using Gabor filters. We present two methods of designing Gabor filters for extracting slub in both the time domain and the frequency domain. The first method selects a better filter in the time domain according to a designed cost function. The second method obtains the proper parameters for the filter in the frequency domain according to the frequency characteristic of slubs. The experimental results with real woven fabric images confirm {{the usefulness of the}} two approaches proposed in this paper. The latter is found to be better than the former. Further, both methods are superior to the existing algorithm. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
5000|$|The {{occurrence}} of many <b>slubs</b> in the <b>yarn</b> {{was well known}} to the weavers in the Hollins factory in Glasgow for they knew that much labor had to be spent after the weaving on “burling and mending” of the fabric in order to remove as many faults as possible. But in the spinning mill at Pleasley Vale yarn clearing was regarded as an undesirable and costly process. [...] The yarn production people in Pleasley believed that their slub catchers were effective - {{it was obvious to}} them that a slub up to an eighth in diameter could not pass through a slot only 10 thousandths of an inch wide. They never saw the evidence of their erroneous belief since they did not see the woven fabric with the many slubs that had passed through their yarn cleaners.|$|R
40|$|Quality is a {{subjective}} notion that {{is related to}} customer needs. Generally, to respond customer requirements, different criteria should be satisfied at the same time. For textile materials, this objective is not evident because of the interdependence of the properties and the experimental constraints. In order to optimize all yarn parameters simultaneously, we tried, through this research, to find a compromise zone that could satisfy to the best set of the objectives of slub yarns. For this goal, we have optimized <b>Slub</b> <b>yarn</b> quality including the major physical properties of cotton <b>Slub</b> <b>yarn</b> by using diagrams of superimposed contours...|$|E

40|$|This work {{seeks to}} {{consider}} the contribution that Ikat weaving and warp printing could make to contemporary textile design. To do this the research first considered the historical background to Ikat weaving and warp printing by examining'the visual and structural characteristics involved and the definitions used historically. Then by studying in some detail the methods of manufacture, dyestuffs, and design imagery of warp Ikats from South America and Central Asia, and weft and double Ikats from Indonesia and Japan a particular was made with a detailed study comparison of these Ikat techniques in The first volume of this work concluded with a detailed study of warp, weft and double Ikats in Japan. From this historic basis {{and analysis of the}} various techniques used experiments were devised to understand more clearly the effect of fibre, structure, colouration, warp design and its positioning on the image produced in the fabric. In investigating this a series of practical experiments was carried out on warp printed wool, cotton and silk fabrics and measurements made {{of the effects of the}} variables. These results were used to undertake a second series of experiments using <b>slub</b> weft <b>yarns,</b> warp printed silk and warp printed cotton fabrics made from a double warp. The work established from an historical viewpoint that the Ikat weavers were familiar and well practised within the traditional design limits of their craft but that these limits were differently defined for the various types of Ikat produced throughout the world. From the technological experiments the factors controlling the image, its size, position. and effect were determined so that ultimately exemplar design effects were created which suggested ways in which this technique could be developed in the future...|$|R
