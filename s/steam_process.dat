30|$|In {{order to}} avoid early steam breakthrough, the first {{approach}} was steamflooding followed by hot water-flooding, which was successfully applied in the Kern River field.

The further approach was water alternating <b>steam</b> <b>process</b> (WASP). Section  13 D of West Coalinga Field was the first WASP pilot project.

In the present study, the chemical change of Panax ginseng induced by steaming was monitored in situ. Methods: Samples were separated from the same ginseng root by incision during the <b>steaming</b> <b>process,</b> for in situ monitoring. Sampling was sequentially performed in three stages; FG (fresh ginseng) → SG (steamed ginseng) → RG (red ginseng) and 60 samples were prepared and freeze dried. The samples were then analyzed to determine 43 constituents among three stages of P.  ginseng. Results: The results showed that six malonyl-ginsenoside (Rg 1, Rb 1, Rb 3, Rc, Rd, Rb 2) and 15 amino acids were decreased in concentration during the <b>steaming</b> <b>process.</b> In contrast, ginsenoside-Rh 1, 20 (S) -Rg 2, 20 (S, R) -Rg 3 and Maillard reaction product such as AF (arginine-fructose), AFG (arginine-fructose-glucose), and maltol were newly generated or their concentrations were increased.

50|$|Continuous {{operation}} of the injection and production wells at approximately reservoir pressure eliminates the instability problems that plague all high-pressure and cyclic <b>steam</b> <b>processes</b> and SAGD produces a smooth, even production that can {{be as high as}} 70% to 80% of oil in place in suitable reservoirs. The process is relatively insensitive to shale streaks and other vertical barriers to steam and fluid flow because, as the rock is heated, differential thermal expansion allows steam and fluids to gravity flow through to the production well. This allows recovery rates of 60% to 70% of oil in place, even in formations with many thin shale barriers. Thermally, SAGD is generally twice as efficient as the older cyclic <b>steam</b> stimulation (CSS) <b>process,</b> and it results in far fewer wells being damaged by the high pressures associated with CSS.

30|$|This study {{demonstrates}} the water alternating <b>steam</b> <b>process</b> (WASP) {{that can be}} economically optimized by applying a response surface correlation. Four parameters used are WASP-start, WASP-cycle, steam/water injection rate, and oil price. The oil price significantly influences to the NPV, while the WASP-start does not have significant effects on the NPV. In the maximum NPV case, increasing oil price at the same steam injection rate reduces the WASP-start and raises the WASP-cycle. Similar circumstance is obtained when the injection rate increases at the same oil price. In our specific case, if the economy is prioritized and oil price is 45  $/barrel, the optimum case will be achieved in which the WASP-start is 3.0  years, the WASP-cycle is 3.5  months, and the steam/water injection rate is 141  m 3 /day. Then, the NPV and the CO 2 emission results will be 14.1  MM$ and 28.53  ×  103  Tonnes, respectively.

30|$|In steamflooding, {{the steam}} tends {{to move toward}} the upper portion of the {{reservoir}} due to the gravitational effect causing poor drainage in the lower section. This causes the steam to breakthrough to the production well early. The water alternating <b>steam</b> <b>process</b> (WASP) often provides a solution to the problem. However, studies on WASP are found very limited despite the fact that this process is sensitive to the operating conditions. By investigating the WASP using response surface correlation, the factors governing steam injections operations are evaluated. To achieve the maximum net present value (NPV), several operating conditions are investigated. The side effect of gas fuel burning in the steam generation, i.e., CO 2 emission, is considered in selecting the optimum operating condition. As illustrated by reservoir simulation results, if the economy is prioritized and oil price is 45  $/barrel, the optimum case is achieved in which the WASP-start is 3.0  years, the WASP-cycle is 3.5  months, and the steam/water injection rate is 141  m 3 /day.
