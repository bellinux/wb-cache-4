[...] On January 11, 2011, NASCAR reported drivers can only be able to compete for the championship in one of NASCAR's three national racing series, which means the drivers who race in multiple series, most notably in the Cup and Nationwide Series, are able to compete in the races, but not for the championship.|$|E

The gas man may also help pull old tires from the race car after lug nuts are loosened if the car does not need fuel or if the car needs little fuel and the gas man finishes his job before anyone else. Prior to the 2011 season, an additional gas man (the [...] "catch-can" [...] man) was allowed over the wall to hold a special can over the car's fuel system overflow port to collect any spilled fuel. NASCAR disallowed the catch-can man in 2011; now the fuel cans are <b>self-venting</b> to reduce spillage.|$|E
5000|$|... 2011 marked one of {{the largest}} “green initiatives” in the fifty plus year history of NASCAR when all fuel sources were to include Ethanol in a blend called E15. [...] One {{unintended}} consequence of the conversion was higher horsepower and therefore slightly lower fuel economy. It is argued however, that the reduction in fuel economy and the resultant increase in fuel use may offset any environmental impact savings by reduced emissions. Although not connected to the fuel blend, a new “Dry Break” <b>self-venting</b> fuel supply can was also adopted in part for safety (reduced the number of people working on the racecar during a pit stop) but also in part {{to reduce the amount of}} fuel spilled during a pit stop, which has both environmental and safety implications. The reduced fuel spillage is negligible at best when observing a pit stop as fuel spills are common and during competition there is no real method to determine with any certainty the volume of fuel lost.|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a new modeling capability to study the behavior of pulse combustors. Our approach {{is based on the}} use of higher-order Godunov methods combined with adaptive strategies to focus computational effort where it is required and a Cartesian grid formulation for modeling realistic engineering geometries. The model computes quasi-one-dimensional, axisymmetric, and fully threedimensional, reacting fluid dynamics in the combustion chamber and incorporates lower-dimensional approximations for both the inlet valve that controls the injection of fuel and the tail pipe whose acoustic properties drive the combustion oscillations. Introduction Combustion systems that take advantage of a periodic combustion process have many advantages over conventional systems. Their rate of heat transfer is greatly enhanced and their pollutant emissions are lower. They draw in their own supply of fuel and air and they are <b>self-venting.</b> They have few moving parts.

40|$|Human {{exploration}} architecture {{studies have}} identified liquid oxygen (LOX) Methane (LCH 4) {{as a strong}} candidate for both interplanetary and descent ascent propulsion solutions. Significant research efforts into methane propulsion have been conducted for over 50 years, ranging from fundamental combustion mixing efforts to rocket chamber and system level demonstrations. Over the past 15 years NASA and its partners have built upon these early activities that have demonstrated practical components and sub-systems needed to field future methane space transportation elements. These advanced development efforts have formed a foundation of LOXLCH 4 propulsion knowledge that has significantly reduced the development risks of future methane based space transportation elements for human exploration beyond earth orbit. As a bipropellant propulsion system, LOXLCH 4 has some favorable characteristics for long life and reusability, which are critical to lunar and Mars missions. Non-toxic, non-corrosive, <b>self-venting,</b> and simple to purge. No extensive decontamination process required as with toxic propellants. High vapor pressure provides for excellent vacuum ignition characteristics. Performance is better than current earth storable propellants for human scale spacecraft. Provides the capability for future Mars exploration missions to use propellants that are produced in-situ on Mars Liquid Methane is thermally similar to O 2 as a cryogenic propellant, 90, 111 K (LO 2, LCH 4 respectively) instead of the 23 K of LH 2. Allows for common components and thus providing cost savings as compared to liquid hydrogen (LH 2). Due to liquid methane having a 6 x higher density than hydrogen, it {{can be stored in}} much smaller volumes. Cryogenic storage aspect of these propellants needs to be addressed. Passive techniques using shielding and orientations to deep space Refrigeration may be required to maintain both oxygen and methane in liquid form...|$|E
40|$|Combustion {{systems that}} take {{advantage}} of a periodic combustion process have many advantages over conventional systems. Their rate of heat transfer is greatly enhanced and their pollutant emissions are lower. They draw in their own supply of fuel and air and they are <b>self-venting.</b> They have few moving parts. The most common type of pulse combustor is based on a Helmholtz resonator - a burning cycle drives a resonant pressure wave, which in turn enhances the rate of combustion, resulting in a self-sustaining, large-scale oscillation. Although the basic physical mechanisms controlling such a process were explained by Rayleigh over a century ago, a full understanding of the operation of a pulse combustor still does not exist. The dominant processes in such a system [...] combustion, turbulent fluid dynamics, acoustics [...] are highly coupled and interact nonlinearly, which has reduced the design process to a costly and inefficient trial-and-error procedure. Several recent numerical and experimental studies, however, have been focused towards {{a better understanding of the}} basic underlying physics. Barr et al. [l] have elucidated the relative roles of the time scales governing the energy release, the turbulent mixing, and the acoustics. Keller et al. [5] have demonstrated the importance of the phase relation between the resonant pressure field in the tailpipe and the periodic energy release. Marcus et al. [6] have developed the capability for a fully three-dimensional simulation of the reacting flow in a pulse combustor. This paper is an application of that methodology to a detailed investigation of the frequency response of the model to changes in the chemical kinetics. The methodology consists of a fully conservative second-order Godunov algorithm for the inviscid, reacting gas dynamics equations coupled to an adaptive mesh refinement procedure[2]. The axisymmetric and three-dimensional simulations allow us to explore in detail the interaction between the transient fluid dynamics phenomena and the energy release associated with the combustion. For these simulations, we couple a second-order, unsplit Godunov algorithm for the inviscid, reacting gas dynamics equations to an adaptive Cartesian grid scheme[7]. In order to keep computational costs relatively low, we have developed a ''bootstrap'' procedure to initialize progressively higher-dimensional calculations. The quasi-one-dimensional code is run until transient phenomena have subsided and a desirable quasi-steady state has been achieved. The state data is then extrapolated to axisymmetric coordinates and these conditions used to initialize an axisymmetric calculation. The axisymmetric code is then run through several full combustion cycles and the data mapped to initialize a three-dimensional calculation...|$|E
