5|$|The {{physical}} barrier {{was to be}} backed up by air-dropped and hand-emplaced acoustic and seismic <b>sensors</b> <b>that</b> would provide both warning and location of enemy movements.

In June 1968 it was renamed for the last time, becoming Operation Igloo White.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 Hicks {{took a job}} at the Western Electric Company, {{designing}} and testing quartz crystal oscillators in Kearny, New Jersey. She was the first woman to be employed by Western Electric as an engineer, and she spent three years working there. Upon the death of her father, she joined the Bloomfield, New Jersey based Newark Controls Company, a metalworking firm that her father had founded. Hicks served as chief engineer and then as {{vice president in charge of}} engineering, before purchasing control of the company from her uncle in 1955. Hicks designed and patented a gas density switch later used in the U.S. space program, including the moon landing, and was a pioneer in the field of <b>sensors</b> <b>that</b> detected when devices were reaching structural limits. Hicks authored several technical papers on the gas density switch. While at Newark Controls Hicks pursued a master's degree in physics, which she received in 1949 from the Stevens Institute.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by the diverse array of border threats, ranging from terrorists to arms dealers and human traffickers. We consider a moving <b>sensor</b> <b>that</b> patrols a certain section of a border with the objective to detect infiltrators who attempt to penetrate that section. Infiltrators arrive according to a Poisson process {{along the border with}} a specified distribution of arrival location, and disappear a random amount of time after their arrival. The measures of effectiveness are the target (infiltrator) detection rate and the time elapsed from target arrival to target detection. We study two types of <b>sensor</b> trajectories <b>that</b> have constant endpoints, are periodic, and maintain constant speed: (1) a <b>sensor</b> <b>that</b> jumps instantaneously from the endpoint back to the starting-point, and (2) a <b>sensor</b> <b>that</b> moves continuously back and forth. The controlled parameters (decision variables) are the starting and end points of the patrolled sector and the velocity of the sensor. General properties of these trajectories are investigated. ...|$|R

In other words, the chromaticity of white and grey are the same while their brightness differs.|$|E
