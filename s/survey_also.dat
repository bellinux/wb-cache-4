5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in 2008 found {{the foundations of}} a rectangular building, oriented north-north-west, {{thought to be the}} remains of a large hall, 33 x 13 metres (108 x 43 feet). To the north of the hall the survey found magnetic anomalies representing a complex of living buildings styled as a manor house. The same <b>survey</b> <b>also</b> found large magnetic anomalies {{in the eastern part of}} the site, which could be buried rubble from the demolition of a farmhouse, or the remains of in-filled cellars which are believed to have been built on the site. Evidence of a footpath around the interior of the site was also discovered. Given the evidence found, it is likely that the anomalies represent more than one phase of construction, though this could not be conclusively proven with the methods used.|$|E
