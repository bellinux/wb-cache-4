25|$|Although {{the feature}} was {{initially}} announced with the game, {{the ability to}} use create mode with other players online {{was not included in the}} final release. This functionality was added to the game through a <b>software</b> <b>patch</b> in November 2009 following a public closed beta test. Users are able to invite up to three people from their PlayStation Network Friends list to join them and create levels together.|$|E
25|$|The 2005 Sony BMG CD copy {{protection}} scandal started when security researcher Mark Russinovich revealed on October 31, 2005 that Sony's Extended Copy Protection ("XCP") {{copy protection}} software on the CD Get Right with the Man by Van Zant contained hidden files that could damage the operating system, install spyware {{and make the}} user's computer vulnerable to attack when the CD was played on a Microsoft Windows-based PC. Sony then released a <b>software</b> <b>patch</b> to remove XCP.|$|E

500|$|The Freelancer team kept a {{low profile}} {{throughout}} 2001 before displaying a demo of their latest work at International Games Festival 2002, drawing large crowds. [...] Microsoft announced the project was on schedule, and Digital Anvil added all the planned content for the game by October 2002. [...] A beta test with approximately 500testers was conducted, and the only main activities left were to refine the game's features and to fix errors uncovered in the testing. [...] The game shipped to retailers on March4, 2003, and was later available online through Yahoo's Game on Demand service. [...] Digital Anvil's role on Freelancer ended on June6, 2003, with their delivery of a <b>software</b> <b>patch</b> to resolve issues on the server and cheating; the staff were redeployed to other departments in Microsoft. [...] In accordance with their 5-year support policy for software, Microsoft stopped supporting the game on April8, 2008, and shutdown their global server, which managed the list of multiplayer servers and the connection of players to them.|$|E
2500|$|Security {{experts report}} a {{security}} hole, dubbed the [...] "Shellshock" [...] bug, in the Unix Bash shell internet program code that dates from version 1.13 in 1992 {{and may be}} considered more significant than the [...] "Heartbleed" [...] bug.

2500|$|In 2016, Kaspersky {{discovered}} a zero day vulnerability in Microsoft Silverlight. Kaspersky identified {{a string of}} code often used by exploits created by the suspected author. It then used YARA rules on its network of Kaspersky software users to find that string of code and uncover {{the rest of the}} exploit. Afterwards, Microsoft issued a [...] "critical" [...] <b>software</b> <b>patch</b> to protect its software from the vulnerability.|$|E
2500|$|Observers {{noted that}} Adobe was spying on its {{customers}} by including spyware in the Creative Suite 3 software and quietly sending user data to a firm named Omniture. When users became aware, Adobe explained what the suspicious software did and admitted that they: [...] "could and should {{do a better}} job taking security concerns into account". When a security flaw was later discovered in Photoshop CS5, Adobe sparked outrage by saying it would leave the flaw unpatched, so anyone who wanted to use the software securely would have to pay for an upgrade. Following a fierce backlash Adobe decided to provide the <b>software</b> <b>patch.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In mid-June 2005, a <b>software</b> <b>patch</b> for {{the game}} dubbed the [...] "Hot Coffee mod" [...] was {{released}} by Patrick Wildenborg (under the Internet alias [...] "PatrickW"), a 38-year-old modder from the Netherlands. The name [...] "Hot Coffee" [...] refers {{to the way the}} released game alludes to the unseen sex scenes. In the unmodified game, the player takes his girlfriend to her front door and she asks him if he would like to come in for [...] "some coffee". He agrees, and the camera stays outside, swaying back and forth a bit, while moaning sounds are heard. After installing the patch, users can enter the main character's girlfriends' houses and engage in a crudely rendered, fully clothed or nude sexual intercourse mini-game. The fallout from the controversy resulted in a public response from high-ranking politicians in the United States and elsewhere and resulted in the game's recall and re-release.|$|E
40|$|Vulnerability {{scanning}} {{and installing}} <b>software</b> <b>patches</b> for known vulnerabilities greatly affects {{the utility of}} network-based intrusion detection systems that use signatures to detect system compromises. A detailed timeline analysis of important remote-to-local vulnerabilities demonstrates (1) Vulnerabilities in widely-used server software are discovered infrequently (at most 6 times a year) and (2) <b>Software</b> <b>patches</b> to prevent vulnerabilities from being exploited are available before or simultaneously with signatures. Signature-based intrusion detection systems will thus never detect successful system compromises on small secure sites when patches are installed {{as soon as they}} are available...|$|R

2500|$|Considered one of {{the sixth}} {{generation}} of video gaming's most significant titles, and by many reviewers to be {{one of the}} greatest video games ever made, San Andreas received rave reviews by many critics who praised the music, story and gameplay. It became the best-selling video game of 2004, and has sold over 27.5 million copies worldwide as of 2011; it remains the best-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time. The game, like its predecessors, is cited as a landmark in video games for its far-reaching influence within the industry. However, the violence and sexual content of San Andreas has been the source of much public concern and controversy. In particular, a player-made <b>software</b> <b>patch,</b> dubbed the [...] "Hot Coffee mod", unlocked a previously hidden sexual scene. The next main entry in the series, Grand Theft Auto IV, was released on 29 April 2008, also to critical acclaim. San Andreas has been ported to various other platforms and services, such as OS X, Xbox Live, PlayStation Network and mobile devices (iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Fire OS).|$|E

40|$|The {{usage of}} the Internet has become ubiquitous, even for desktop {{applications}} {{to assume that the}} computer system it is running on is connected to the Internet. Desktop applications rely on the Internet connectivity for software license authentication and also for maintenance through downloading of <b>software</b> <b>patches.</b> However, the latter can pose an annoyance to the user when he or she is relying on the Internet for real-time gaming or during heavy downloading of multimedia files. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of using the ARMA model to provide short range forecasting of Internet network TCP traffic for a single broadband line. The outcome of the research is positive and indicates that a step size of 30 seconds and irrespective of the window size gives the most accurate forecast. Through amplification of the results, this method shows strong indication that it can be implemented by software application developers to determine the most appropriate non-disruptive period to download their <b>software</b> <b>patches.</b> For small sized <b>software</b> <b>patches,</b> the <b>software</b> application can activate the download and a period of 120 seconds would be sufficient...|$|R

40|$|<b>Software</b> <b>patching</b> has {{not been}} an {{effective}} first-line defense preventing large-scale worm attacks, even when patches had long been available for their corresponding vulnerabilities. Generally, people have been reluctant to patch their systems immediately, because patches are perceived to be unreliable and disruptive to apply. To address this problem, we propose a first-line worm defense in the network stack, using shields [...] vulnerability-specific, exploit-generic network filters installed in end systems once a vulnerability is discovered and before the patch is applied. These filters examine the incoming or outgoing traffic of vulnerable applications, and drop traffic that exploits vulnerabilities. Shields are less disruptive to install and uninstall, easier to test for bad side effects, and hence more reliable than traditional <b>software</b> <b>patches.</b> In this paper, we show [...] ...|$|R
