5|$|Prior to the occupation, {{the most}} recent Yugoslav census had been taken in 1931. This census used {{language}} as the primary criterion, and counted all speakers of Serbo-Croatian as one group, rather than recognising distinct Serb, Croat, Bosnian Muslim, Macedonian and Montenegrin nationalities. Aligning data on religious affiliation with the linguistic data {{has been used by}} scholars to determine approximate numbers of <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> in the 1931 census, by counting those of the Roman Catholic denomination as Croats.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} between <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> spread to eastern Slavonia in early 1991. On 1 April, Serb villagers around Vukovar and other towns in eastern Slavonia began to erect barricades across main roads. The White Eagles, a Serbian paramilitary {{group led by}} Vojislav Šešelj, moved into the Serb-populated village of Borovo Selo just north of Vukovar. In mid-April 1991, Armbrust shoulder-launched anti-tank missiles were fired at Borovo Selo. According to one version of the event, missiles were fired at agricultural machinery that served as barricades. According to a second version, three missiles were fired at houses inhabited by Serbs. There were no casualties, but the attack aggravated and deepened ethnic tensions. On 2 May, Serb paramilitaries ambushed two Croatian police buses in the centre of Borovo Selo, killing 12 policemen and injuring 22 more. Three Serbs were also killed. The Battle of Borovo Selo represented the worst act of violence between the country's <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> since the Second World War. It enraged many Croatians {{and led to a}} surge of ethnic violence across Slavonia.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{followed}} escalating {{ethnic tensions}} in the Lika region, including attacks on Croatian civilians in Lovinac, {{an attack on a}} Croatian police checkpoint in Žuta Lokva, and skirmishes at the Plitvice Lakes and the Ljubovo Pass on the Gospić–Plitvička Jezera road. The remainder of 1991 saw further deterioration of the situation in the region, resulting in war crimes against <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> in the Gospić and Široka Kula massacres. Fighting in the region remained deadlocked, with little to no territorial gains to either side, until a lasting ceasefire was called with the signing of the Sarajevo Agreement of 2 January 1992.|$|E

50|$|In June 2013, Judge Frederik Harhoff of Denmark, a judge at the ICTY, {{circulated}} {{a letter}} saying that Meron had pressured other judges into acquitting <b>Serb</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croat</b> commanders. The letter claimed Meron had raised the degree of responsibility that senior military leaders should bear for war crimes committed by their subordinates, {{to the point where}} it a conviction has become nearly impossible. They blamed Meron, whom they identified as an American, for the acquittals of top <b>Serb</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croat</b> commanders.|$|R
5|$|In the east, the Roman–Persian Wars {{continued}} until 561 when the envoys of Justinian and Khosrau {{agreed on a}} 50-year peace. By the mid-550s, Justinian had won victories in most theatres of operation, with the notable exception of the Balkans, which were subjected to repeated incursions from the Slavs and the Gepids. Tribes of <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> were later resettled in the northwestern Balkans, {{during the reign of}} Heraclius. Justinian called Belisarius out of retirement and defeated the new Hunnish threat. The strengthening of the Danube fleet caused the Kutrigur Huns to withdraw and they agreed to a treaty that allowed safe passage back across the Danube.|$|E
25|$|The AFBiH {{was formed}} from three armies of the Bosnian War period: the Bosnian (dominantly Bosniak with numbers of <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croats)</b> Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Bosnian Serb Army of Republika Srpska, and the Croat Defence Council.|$|E
25|$|The first {{newspaper}} in the town was also published during the 1848/49 revolution—it was called Honunk állapota ("State of Our Homeland") and was published in Hungarian by Károly Bitterman's local printing company.

25|$|The {{worsening}} {{crisis in}} Bosnia commanded attention and demanded {{some kind of}} U.S. response. Aspin did not favor using ground forces {{to intervene in the}} civil war involving the Bosnian Muslims, <b>Serbs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croats,</b> but thought that the use of sophisticated weapons was a more reasonable option. Eventually the administration decided on an airdrop of humanitarian aid, even though Aspin did not favor the plan.|$|E
25|$|According to some, a Bosnian can {{be anyone}} who holds {{citizenship}} {{of the state}} of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and thus is largely synonymous with the all-encompassing national demonym Bosnians and Herzegovinians. This includes, but is not limited to, members of the constituent ethnic groups of Bosnia and Herzegovina: Bosniaks, <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croats.</b> Those who reside in the smaller geographical region of Herzegovina usually prefer to identify as Herzegovinians.|$|E
25|$|Muslim National Organization (MNO), a {{political}} party founded in 1906, was a major opponent of the regime and promoted the idea of Muslims as a separate entity from <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croats.</b> A group of dissidents that, among other things, identified themselves with the Croat Muslim identity formed a party named Muslim Progressive Party (MNS), However, the party received little popular support and faded away {{over the next few}} years.|$|E

50|$|As ethnic {{tensions}} grew, {{one of the}} first Muslim proposals was announced on 25 June 1991. It called for the establishment of three entities (Muslim, <b>Serb</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croat),</b> each composed of two or three non-contiguous territories.|$|R

25|$|Widespread ethnic {{cleansing}} accompanied the War in Bosnia (1992–1995). Large numbers of Croats and Bosniaks {{were forced to}} flee their homes by the Army of the Republika Srpska, large numbers of Serbs and Bosniaks by the Croatian Defence Council and <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> by the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Beginning in 1991, political upheavals in the Balkans displaced about 2,700,000 people by mid-1992, of which over 700,000 sought asylum {{in other parts of}} Europe.|$|E
25|$|According {{to legal}} experts, as of early 2008, 45 Serbs, 12 Croats and 4 Bosniaks {{were convicted of}} war crimes by the ICTY in {{connection}} with the Balkan wars of the 1990s. Both <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> were indicted and convicted of systematic war crimes (joint criminal enterprise), while Bosniaks were indicted and convicted of individual ones. Most of the Bosnian Serb wartime leadership Biljana Plavšić, Momčilo Krajišnik, Radoslav Brđanin, and Duško Tadić were indicted and judged guilty for war crimes and ethnic cleansing.|$|E
25|$|The Graz {{agreement}} was a proposed {{agreement made between}} the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadžić and the Bosnian Croat leader Mate Boban on 6 May 1992 {{in the city of}} Graz, Austria. The agreement publicly declared the territorial division between Republika Srpska and the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia and called for an end of conflicts between <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croats.</b> The largest group in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Bosniaks, did not take part in the agreement and were not invited to the negotiations.|$|E

25|$|Tito died on 4 May 1980 of {{complications}} from surgery. While it had been {{known for some time}} that the 87-year-old president's health had been failing, his death nonetheless came as a shock to the country. This was because Tito was looked upon as the country's hero in World War II and had been the country's dominant figure and identity for over three decades. His loss marked a significant alteration, and it was reported that many Yugoslavs openly mourned his death. In the Split soccer stadium, <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> visited the coffin among other spontaneous outpourings of grief, and a funeral was organized by the League of Communists.|$|E
25|$|Montenegro saw {{independence}} {{under the}} Petrović-Njegoš dynasty, firstly as a principality {{and then as}} a kingdom. Both Kingdoms fought together as independent states in the Balkan Wars and in the First World War. At {{the end of the war}} in 1918 tensions arose between the two states as the Montenegrin Whites with Serbian support deposed Nicholas I of Montenegro and proclaimed Montenegro's unification with Serbia as part of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (renamed into Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929), while the Montenegrin Greens opposed it. The conflict led to the Christmas Uprising, in which the Whites with support from the Serbian army defeated the Greens. During the period of the monarchic Yugoslavia, ruled by the Serbian Karađorđević dynasty, the tensions between <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> were increasing and most of the Montenegrin politicians supported the Serbian proposed centralised state.|$|E
25|$|The mobile army {{immediately}} started {{to invest the}} fortress. Work was begun on a line of field works that ran {{in front of the}} fortress, with its endpoints on the Sambre river, cutting the fortress off from overland access. Two batteries were placed on the main approaches to the town, and work on a second, countervailing, system of trenches was prepared. The Hereditary Prince made the chateau of Bousies his headquarters, and the Austrian auxiliaries (Hungarians, <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croats),</b> destined to do the spadework for the entrenchments, built a camp in the forest of Mormal. After 20 April the preparations for the intended bombardment progressed slowly as the mobile army had to provide troops for the operations of the other Coalition forces that were needed to deflect French attempts at relief of the fortress (8,000 men on 22 April alone). Those attempts at relief were defeated by the Coalition in the Battles of Villers-en-Cauchies and Beaumont-en-Cambresis. Sorties by the garrison also hindered the preparations.|$|E
50|$|The First Corps was {{responsible}} for the zone of Sarajevo during the war with the Bosnian <b>Serb</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croat</b> forces <b>and</b> its headquarters were established in Sarajevo. The First Corps had the assignment of protecting the Sarajevo, Gorazde zone from the opponents.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{numerous}} ICTY verdicts <b>and</b> indictments, <b>Serb</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croat</b> forces performed ethnic cleansing of their territories planned by their political leadership to create ethnically pure states (Republika Srpska and Republic of Serbian Krajina by the Serbs; and Herzeg-Bosnia by the Croats).|$|R
50|$|Although once {{a diverse}} town, {{many of the}} former <b>Serb</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croat</b> {{residents}} left their homes during the Bosnian war. Few have returned to their properties, {{and those who do}} often suffer discrimination. Now, it is a mostly Bosniak town, with few non-Bosniaks remaining.|$|R
25|$|Slavs {{settled in}} Bosnia, Herzegovina, and the {{surrounding}} lands, which were then part of the Eastern Roman Empire, in the seventh century. The Slavic <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> settled sometime after {{the first wave of}} Slavs. The Croats established a kingdom in what is northwestern Croatia. The Serbs settled in what is now southcentral Serbia, and later expanding into the upper Drina valley of eastern Bosnia and into Eastern Herzegovina, known in the later Middle Ages as Zahumlje. The Croats to the west came {{under the influence of the}} Germanic Carolingian Empire and the Roman Catholic Church, and Croatia was closely tied to Hungary and later Austria until the twentieth century. The Serbs to the east came under periodic Byzantine rule, converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity and absorbed Byzantine cultural influences. After some centuries of rule by Croatia, Serb principalities, and the Byzantine Empire, an independent Bosnian kingdom flourished in central Bosnia between the 12th and the 15th centuries.|$|E
500|$|According to Kaegi, the Byzantines had [...] "an almost {{compulsive}} ... {{preference to}} avoid changing {{the essential elements}} of the status quo". They tried with all diplomatic means to secure allies and divide their enemies. Although they failed against Khosrow and the Avar Khagan, their ties with the Slavs who would become the <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> and their decades-long negotiations with the Göktürks resulted in Slavs actively opposing the Avars {{in addition to a}} key alliance with the Göktürks.|$|E
500|$|The Hungarian {{authorities}} established {{concentration camps}} for Serbs {{from which they}} were eventually expelled to the German-occupied territory of Serbia. As part of the [...] "systematic magyarisation" [...] of these territories, Hungarian political parties and patriotic organisations were encouraged to be active in Bačka and Baranja, which resulted in discrimination against [...] "less-desirable elements" [...] of the population such as Serbs, Croats and Jews. Discrimination extended to education and communication, where Hungarian and German were the only languages permitted in almost all secondary schools, and books, newspapers and periodicals in the Serbo-Croat language were virtually banned. Well-educated <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> were precluded from undertaking work commensurate with their education. Despite this, <b>Serbs</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croats</b> that {{had lived in the}} territories prior to 1918 retained their citizenship rights as Hungarians, and some lower-level non-Hungarian public employees were retained in their jobs. One former Serb senator and one former Croat parliamentary deputy sat in the Hungarian Parliament. In Prekmurje, the Hungarian authorities were more permissive, making no attempt to deport Slovenes in large numbers, and allowing the Slovene language to be used in public. Likewise, the Hungarians curried favour with the Bunjevci minority in order to persuade them that they were neither Serbs nor Croats, nor even Slavs at all: they were [...] "Hungarians of Bunyevac mother-tongue".|$|E
50|$|According to {{the data}} from the 1910 Austro-Hungarian {{population}} census the Prijedor district had a 59.08% Orthodox Serb majority. A portion of the Bosniak population left during the Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which increased the proportion of the <b>Serb</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croat</b> population.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Serb</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croat</b> {{political}} leadership {{agreed on a}} partition of Bosnia with the 1991 Karađorđevo agreement and the 1992 Graz agreement, resulting in the Croat forces turning against the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croat-Bosniak war (1992 - 94).|$|R
50|$|Contrary to {{frequent}} <b>Serb</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croat</b> nationalist claims, Bosnia and Herzegovina constitutes a historical entity {{which has its}} own identity and its own history, according to Mitja Velikonja. Robert Donia claims that as Serbia and Croatia only occupied parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina briefly in the Middle Ages, neither have any serious historical claims to Bosnia. Moreover, Donia states that although Bosnia did interact with its <b>Serb</b> <b>and</b> <b>Croat</b> neighbors over the centuries, it had a very different history and culture from them. 12th-century Byzantine historian John Kinnamos reported that Bosnia was not subordinated to Serbia. According to American historian John V.A. Fine, a leading authority on medieval Balkan history, the Bosnians (Bošnjani) have been a distinct people since at least the 10th century.|$|R
