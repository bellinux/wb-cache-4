40|$|AbstractIn {{the paper}} some {{problems}} {{connected with a}} process of knowledge discovery are considered. These problems are reduced to the set cover problem. It is known that under a plausible assumption on the class N P the greedy algorithm is close to best approximate polynomial algorithms for the set cover problem solving. Unfortunately, the performance ratio of this algorithm grows almost as natural logarithm on the cardinality of covered set. Instead of usual greedy algorithm we consider greedy algorithm with threshold. This algorithm constructs a partial cover, which covers at least a fixed part (for example, 90 %) of the set. We prove that the cardinality of constructed partial cover is bounded from above by a linear function on the minimal cardinality of exact cover Cmin. In the case of 90 % -cover, for example, in the capacity of <b>such</b> <b>function</b> <b>we</b> can take the function 2. 31,·,Cmin+ 1. This bound is independent of the cardinality of covered set. Notice {{that the concept of}} partial cover in context of knowledge discovery problems is very close to the concept of approximate reduct...|$|E
40|$|Atomic Force Microscopy {{has enabled}} 2 D imaging at the sub-molecular level, and 3 D mapping of the {{potential}} field. However, fast identification of the surface still remains a challenging topic. In this paper, as a step towards implementation of <b>such</b> <b>function,</b> <b>we</b> introduce a control scheme and mathematical treatment of the acquired data that enable retrieval of essential information characterizing the potential field, leading to fast acquisition of images with chemical contrast. The control scheme is based on tip sample distance modulation at an angular frequency of ω, and null control of the 1 ω component of the self excitation frequency of the oscillator. It is demonstrated that the control is robust in UHV for a frequency well {{as small as a}} few Hz/MHz, and that the mathematical treatment results in satisfactory identification {{of the potential}} field. Morse potential is chosen as a case study for identifying the Morse parameters per pixel. Atomic features with similar topography were distinguished by differences in the parameters. The decay length parameter was resolved with a resolution of 10 pm. The method was demonstrated on quenched Silicon at a scan rate comparable to normal imaging. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|The {{generalized}} hypertree width GHW (H) of a hypergraph H is {{a measure}} of its cyclicity. Classes of conjunctive queries or constraint satisfaction problems whose associated hypergraphs have bounded GHW are known to be solvable in polynomial time. However, it has been an open problem for several years if for a fixed constant k and input hypergraph H it can be determined in polynomial time whether GHW (H) ≤ k. Here, this problem is settled by proving that even for k = 3 the problem is already NP-hard. On the way to this result, another long standing open problem, originally raised by Goodman and Shmueli in 1984 in the context of join optimization is solved. It is proven that determining whether a hypergraph H admits a tree projection with respect to a hypergraph G is NP-complete. Our intractability results on generalized hypertree width motivate further research on more restrictive tractable hypergraph decomposition methods that approximate general hypertree decomposition (GHD). We show that each such method is dominated by a tractable decomposition method definable through a function that associates a set of partial edges to a hypergraph. By using one particular <b>such</b> <b>function,</b> <b>we</b> define the new Component Hypertree Decomposition method, which is tractable and strictly more general than other approximations to GHD published so far...|$|E

40|$|Blind signal {{separation}} {{is the problem}} of estimating a set of source signals from their mixture without prior knowledge about the source signals. Negentropy is an objective function used in the problem of BSS in which negentropy is an information theoretic quantity used as a measure of signal independence in the problem of blind signal separation and it is used as a quality criterion in various signal processing problems such as segmentation and detection. Negentropy is in some sense the optimal estimator of nongaussianity, as far as thestatistical performance is concerned. The problem in using negentropy is that it is computationally very difficult. Estimating negentropy using the definition would require an estimate of the probability density function. Therefore simpler approximations of negentropy are very useful but the performance of this approximation depend on choosing the probability density function so that we introduced in this paper a new non-quadratic function called Generalized Laplace Function. To estimate the parameters of <b>such</b> <b>function</b> <b>we</b> used twomethods first the maximum likelihood function and the second kurtosis. To blindly extract the independent source signals, we resort to FastICA approach. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is capable of separating mixture of signals and also show that the performance of generalized Laplace is best of all otherfunctions that had been proved its performance...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{a family of}} (2, 2) -rational functions given {{on the set of}} complex p-adic field C_p. Each such function has a unique fixed point. We study p-adic dynamical systems generated by the (2, 2) -rational functions. We show that the fixed point is indifferent and therefore the convergence of the trajectories is not the typical case for the dynamical systems. Siegel disks of these dynamical systems are found. We obtain an upper bound for the set of limit points of each trajectory, i. e., we determine a sufficiently small set containing the set of limit points. For each (2, 2) -rational function on C_p there are two points x̂_ 1 =x̂_ 1 (f), x̂_ 2 =x̂_ 2 (f) ∈C_p which are zeros of its denominator. We give explicit formulas of radiuses of spheres (with the center at the fixed point) containing some points such that the trajectories (under actions of f) of the points after a finite step come to x̂_ 1 or x̂_ 2. Moreover for a class of (2, 2) -rational functions we study ergodicity properties of the dynamical systems on the set of p-adic numbers Q_p. For each <b>such</b> <b>function</b> <b>we</b> describe all possible invariant spheres. We show that the p-adic dynamical system reduced on each invariant sphere is not ergodic with respect to Haar measure. Comment: 23 page...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} an {{algebraic}} {{attack against the}} Flurry and Curry block ciphers [12, 13]. Usually, algebraic attacks against block ciphers only require one message/ciphertext pair to be mounted. In this paper, we investigate a different approach. Roughly, {{the idea is to}} generate an algebraic system from the knowledge of several well chosen correlated message/ciphertext pairs. Flurry and Curry are two families of ciphers which fully parametrizable and having a sound design strategy against the most common statistical attacks; i. e. linear and differential attacks. These ciphers are then targets of choices for algebraic attacks. It turns out that our new approach permits to go one step further in the (algebraic) cryptanalysis of difficult instances of Flurry and Curry. To explain the behavior of our attack, we have established an interesting connection between algebraic attacks and high order differential cryptanalysis [32]. From extensive experiments, we estimate that our approach – that we will call ”algebraic-high order differential” cryptanalysis – is polynomial when the Sbox is a power function. As a proof of concept, {{we have been able to}} break Flurry/Curry – up to 8 rounds – in few hours. We have also investigated the more difficult (and interesting case) of the inverse function. For <b>such</b> <b>function,</b> <b>we</b> have not been able to bound precisely the theoretical complexity, but our experiments indicate that our approach permits to obtain a significant practical gain.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{address the problem}} of using any {{third-party}} custom sparql function by only knowing its URI, allowing the computa- tion to be executed on the remote endpoint that defines and implements <b>such</b> <b>function.</b> <b>We</b> present a standard-compliant solution that does not require changes to the current syntax or semantics of the language, based on the use of a call function. In contrast to the plain Value Testing" described in the W 3 C Recommendations for the sparql Query Language, our approach is interoperable, that is, not dependent on the specific implementation of the endpoint being used for the query, relying instead on the implementation of the endpoint that declares and makes the function available, therefore reducing interoperability issues to one single case for which we provide an open source implementation. Further, the proposed solution for using custom functions within sparql queries is quite expressive, allowing for true higher-order functions, where func- tions can be assigned to variables and used as both inputs and outputs, enabling a generation of Web APIs for sparql that we call Web of Func- tions. The paper also shows different approaches on how our proposal can be applied to existing endpoints, including a SPARQL-to-SPARQL compiler that makes the use of call unnecessary, by exploiting non- normative sections in the Federated Query W 3 C Recommendations that are currently implemented on some popular sparql engines. We finally evaluate the effectiveness of our proposal reporting our experiments on two popular engines...|$|E
