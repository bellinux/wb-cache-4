Although most studies have focussed on the predominant omega- 3 fatty acids found in fish oils (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid), recent evidence suggests similar health benefits from their common precursor, <b>stearidonic</b> <b>acid.</b> <b>Stearidonic</b> <b>acid</b> is a Δ 6 -unsaturated C 18 omega- 3 fatty acid present in a few plant species (mainly the Boraginaceae and Primulaceae) reflecting the general absence of Δ 6 -desaturation from higher plants. Using a Δ 6 -desaturase from Primula vialii, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis and linseed lines accumulating <b>stearidonic</b> <b>acid</b> in their seed lipids. Significantly, the P. vialiiΔ 6 -desaturase specifically only utilises α-linolenic acid as a substrate, resulting in the accumulation of <b>stearidonic</b> <b>acid</b> but not omega- 6 γ-linolenic acid. Detailed lipid analysis revealed the accumulation of <b>stearidonic</b> <b>acid</b> in neutral lipids such as triacylglycerol but an absence from the acyl-CoA pool. In the case of linseed, the achieved levels of <b>stearidonic</b> <b>acid</b> (13. 4 % of triacylglycerols) are very similar to those found in the sole natural commercial plant source (Echium spp.) or transgenic soybean oil. However, both those latter oils contain γ-linolenic acid, which is not normally present in fish oils and considered undesirable for heart-healthy applications. By contrast, the stearidonic acid-enriched linseed oil is essentially devoid of this fatty acid. Moreover, the overall omega- 3 /omega- 6 ratio for this modified linseed oil is also significantly higher. Thus, this nutritionally enhanced linseed oil may have superior health-beneficial properties.

40|$|The Prymnesiophyceae coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} alga in our oceans and therefore plays a central role in marine foodwebs.

Here we describe the identification and functional characterisation of the five E. huxleyi genes which direct the synthesis of docosahexaenoic acid in this alga. Surprisingly, E. huxleyi does not use the conventional Δ 6 -pathway, instead using the alternative Δ 8 -desaturation route which has previously only been observed in a few unrelated microorganisms.

In an attempt to identify a gene(s) encoding an enzyme(s) specific for the elongation of γ-linolenic acid (GLA) (18 : 3 n- 6), a cDNA expression library was made from the fungus Mortierella alpina. The cDNA library constructed in a yeast expression vector was screened by measuring the expressed elongase activity [conversion of GLA to dihomo-GLA (20 : 3 n- 6) ] from an individual yeast clone. In this report, we demonstrate the isolation of a cDNA (GLELO) whose encoded protein (GLELOp) was involved in the conversion of GLA to dihomo-GLA in an efficient manner (60 % conversion). This cDNA contains a 957 -nucleotide ORF that encodes a protein of 318 amino acids. Substrate specificity analysis revealed that this fungal enzyme acted also on <b>stearidonic</b> <b>acid</b> (18 : 4 n- 3). This report identifies and characterizes an elongase subunit that acts specifically on the two Δ 6 -desaturation products, 18 : 3 n- 6 and 18 : 4 n- 3. When this GLELO cDNA was coexpressed with M. alpina Δ 5 -desaturase cDNA in yeast, it resulted in the conversion of GLA to arachidonic acid (20 : 4 n- 6) as well as the conversion of <b>stearidonic</b> <b>acid</b> to eicosopentaenoic acid (20 : 5 n- 3). Thus, this GLELO gene may play an critical role in the bio-production of both n- 6 and n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the association between baseline plasma fatty acids profile {{and the risk of}} future major cardiovascular events in patients with a history of ischaemic heart disease or ischemic stroke. METHODS: Baseline plasma fatty acids as well as established cardiovascular risk factors were measured in 2, 263 patients enrolled in the SUpplementation with FOLate, vitamins B- 6 and B- 12 and/or OMega- 3 fatty acids randomized controlled trial. Incident major cardiovascular, cardiac and cerebrovascular events were ascertained during the 4. 7 years of follow up. Hazard ratios were obtained from Cox proportional hazards models after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 154, 379 and 84 patients had major cardiovascular, cardiac and cerebrovascular events respectively. Upon adjustment for gender, initial event, baseline age and BMI, the risk of developing a major cardiovascular event decreased significantly in successive quartiles of arachidonic acid (P trend< 0. 002), total omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (P trend< 0. 03), docosapentaenoic acid (P trend< 0. 019), docosahexaenoic acid (P trend< 0. 004), eicosapentaenoic acid + docosahexaenoic acid (P trend< 0. 03) and eicosapentaenoic acid + docosapentaenoic acid + docosahexaenoic acid (P trend< 0. 02). This inverse association was borderline significant with increased quartiles of <b>stearidonic</b> <b>acid</b> (P trend< 0. 06). In the full model, only <b>stearidonic</b> <b>acid</b> remained inversely associated with the risk of developing a major cardiovascular event (P trend< 0. 035), a cardiac event (P trend< 0. 016) or a cerebrovascular event (P trend< 0. 014), while arachidonic acid was inversely associated with the risk a cerebrovascular event (P trend< 0. 033). CONCLUSION: The inverse association of long chain omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids with recurrence of Cardiovascular diseases was mainly driven by well-known cardiovascular risk factors.

40|$|Faculty who had {{presented}} at the symposium “Heart Healthy Omega- 3 s (n- 3 fatty <b>acids)</b> for Food: <b>Stearidonic</b> <b>Acid</b> (SDA) as a Sustainable Choice” met and agreed upon conclusions and recommendations {{that could be made}} on the basis of evidence provided at the symposium. The participants also submitted manuscripts relating to their topics and these are presented in this supplement. These manuscripts were reviewed and also contributed to the conclusions and recommendations presented herein. The three major objectives of the symposium were to: 1) increase understanding of the current and emerging knowledge regarding the health benefits of (n- 3) fatty acids (FA) including a focus on <b>stearidonic</b> <b>acid</b> (SDA) and EPA; 2) evaluate the importance of increasing (n- 3) FA consumption in the US and the current challenge of doing so via mainstream foods; and 3) consider the health and food application benefits of SDA as a precursor to EPA and a plant-based sustainable source of highly unsaturated (n- 3) FA for mainstream foods. Specific areas for future research were defined and included in the summary and conclusions herein. Overall evidence-based conclusions included: the current evidence provides a strong rationale for increasing (n- 3) FA intakes in the US and other populations; current consumption of (n- 3) FA in most populations is either insufficient or not efficient at providing adequate tissue levels of the long-chain (n- 3) FA EPA and DHA; SDA in soybean oil appears to be a cost-effective and sustainable plant-based source that could contribute to reaching recommended levels of (n- 3) FA intake, but more research and surveillance is needed; and adding SDA-enriched soybean oil to foods should be considered as a natural fortification approach to improving (n- 3) FA status in the US and other populations. References for these conclusions and recommendations can be found in the articles included in the supplemen...|$|R

30|$|Classically, {{the term}} eicosanoids {{has been used}} to {{describe}} not only those metabolites derived from ARA, but also from other 20 carbon PUFAs, such as EPA and DGLA. Eicosanoids include the COX products prostaglandins (PGs), prostacyclin (PGI) and thromboxanes (TXs); the LOX derived leukotrienes (LTs) and lipoxins (LXs), and the CYP- 450 hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) (Fig.  2). Eicosanoids derived from omega‐ 6 PUFAs (i.e. ARA products PGE 2 and LTB 4) are more powerful than their omega- 3 PUFAs counterparts (i.e. EPA derived PGE 3 and LTB 5), which exert anti-inflammatory effects. SDA (<b>stearidonic</b> <b>acid,</b> 18 : 4 n- 3) and its elongated product 20 : 4 n- 3, have been reported to produce low active and health promoting eicosanoids able to lower plasma triglycerides (TG) [38].|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} growth {{temperature}} on soluble carbohydrate and lipid content of Humicola marvinii, Geomyces pannorum and Mortierella elongata {{isolated from the}} Antarctic (Signy Island; 60 ° 43 ′S, 45 ° 38 ′W) were investigated. Each of these fungi responded differently to suboptimal growth temperatures. At low temperatures Humicola marvinii accumulated cryoprotective carbohydrates (trehalose intracellularly and glycerol extracellularly), whereas Geomyces pannorum responded by altering its lipid composition with increases in unsaturated lipid content and overall unsaturation index. In the case of Mortierella elongata, features that may influence its ability to grow at low temperatures included the absence of detectable ergosterol, the presence of <b>stearidonic</b> <b>acid</b> and increased amounts of intracellular trehalose when grown at lower temperatures. The relative importance of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in adaptation to temperature stress in these fungi is discussed...|$|R
