30|$|Different {{from the}} focused {{irradiation}} cases [1 – 4] where only atom evaporation (or ablation) dominates, athermal surface atom diffusion {{along with the}} <b>surface</b> atom <b>evaporation</b> is expected to occur during the above uniform e-beam irradiation. For the surface atom diffusion, atoms diffusing along the wire surface from one location to another {{could lead to a}} re-distribution of wire atoms, while for the <b>surface</b> atom <b>evaporation,</b> atoms escaping from the wire surface would result in a pure loss of wire materials. In this work, as shown in Fig.  1, the free end with sharp cut edge represented a strong and general tendency of being hemisphere-shaped or rounded. Moreover, the wire universally showed a preferential axial shrinkage from the free end no matter whether it is with sharp cut edge or of hemisphere shape. Similar axial shrinkages preferentially from the free end were also observed in carbon nanotubes [15, 16] as a universal phenomenon. All of these indicated that the nanocurvature effect dominated or governed the dynamics of <b>surface</b> diffusion and <b>evaporation</b> of atoms. On the other hand, as shown in Fig.  1 and Additional file 1 : Figure S 1, the fact that different current densities resulted in different wire shapes and structural evolution rates demonstrated that the beam-induced athermal activation effect would also greatly influence the <b>surface</b> diffusion and <b>evaporation</b> of atoms.|$|R

40|$|Water is {{essential}} for turf growth. It is required for germina-tion, photosynthesis, and {{as a part of}} the turf.

5000|$|Vaporization (or [...] vapourisation) of {{an element}} or {{compound}} is a phase {{transition from the}} liquid phase to vapor. [...] There {{are two types of}} vaporization: evaporation and boiling. Evaporation is a surface phenomenon, whereas boiling is a bulk phenomenon. Evaporation is a phase transition from the liquid phase to vapor (a state of substance below critical temperature) that occurs at temperatures below the boiling temperature at a given pressure. Evaporation occurs on the <b>surface.</b> <b>Evaporation</b> only occurs when the partial pressure of vapor of a substance is less than the equilibrium vapor pressure.|$|E
50|$|A {{geographic}} sink is {{a depression}} within an endorheic basin where water collects with no visible outlet. Instead of discharging, the collected water is lost due to evaporation and/or penetration (water sinking underground, e.g., to become groundwater in an aquifer). If the sink has karstic terrain, water will sink {{at a higher}} rate than the <b>surface</b> <b>evaporation,</b> and conversely if the lakebed or sink bed has a layer of soil that is largely impervious to water (hardpan), evaporation will predominate. Since dry lakes in sinks with hardpan have little penetration, they require more severe aridity/heat to eliminate collected water at a comparable rate as for a similar sink with appreciable penetration.|$|E

The salt itself is imported from Arracan, Ceylon, and even Europe, and is stored in great wooden buildings here and elsewhere. The ground being impregnated with salt, the illicit manufacture by evaporation is not easily checked; but whereas the average number of cases brought to justice used to be twenty and thirty in a week, they are now reduced to two or three. It is remarkable, that though the soil yields such an abundance of this mineral, the water of the Megna at Noacolly is only brackish, and it is therefore to repeated inundations and <b>surface</b> <b>evaporations</b> that the salt is due.

50|$|There are {{two models}} {{that are used}} to {{illustrate}} the influence groundwater has on the formations of duricrusts like gypcrust: per ascensum and per descensum. The per ascensum model demonstrates a situation where the water table is relatively close to the surface, allowing solutions to be drawn upwards by evaporation and eventually cement near-surface sediments once they become concentrated enough to trigger precipitation. The per ascensum model is applicable to environments with high rates of <b>surface</b> <b>evaporation</b> like deserts. This type of system only produces thin duricrust layers since the process ultimately seals the surface horizons, which consequently decreases the potential for further evaporation. This model best depicts the formation of gypcrust.The per descensum model describes a system {{different from that of the}} formation of gypcrust in which precipitation of minerals occurs at a depth from downward-percolating solutions. This type of system explains the formation of thick duricrust horizons.|$|E

50|$|The land surface module {{is based}} on the land surface {{transfer}} model (LSX) package of Thompson and Pollard, and simulates the energy, water, carbon, and momentum balance of the soil-vegetation-atmosphere system. The model represents two vegetation canopies (e.g., trees versus shrubs and grasses), eight soil layers, and three layers of snow (when required). The solar radiative transfer scheme of IBIS-2 has been simplified in comparison with LSX and IBIS-1; sunlit and shaded fractions of the canopies are no longer treated separately. The model now follows the approach of Sellers et al. 1986 and Bonan 1995. Infrared radiation is simulated as if each vegetation layer is a semitransparent plane; canopy emissivity depends on foliage density. Another difference between IBIS-2 and IBIS-1 and LSX, is that IBIS-2 uses an empirical linear function of wind speed to estimate turbulent transfer between the soil surface and the lower vegetation canopy, and IBIS-1 and LSX use a logarithmic wind profile. The total evapotranspiration from the land surface is treated as the sum of three water vapor fluxes: evaporation from the soil <b>surface,</b> <b>evaporation</b> of water intercepted by vegetation canopies, and canopy transpiration.|$|E
