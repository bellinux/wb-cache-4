5|$|An {{elevated}} core temperature, {{leading to}} increased symptom presentation {{has been noted}} during exercise, due to variations in circadian body temperature throughout the day, and due to heat exposure including warm temperatures, warm showers, sun bathing, etc. Care should be taken not to overheat a person with MS {{during the course of}} exercise. There is some evidence that cooling measures are effective in allowing a greater degree of exercise: cold showers, cold water limb immersion, applying ice packs, and drinking cold beverages. These strategies are effective when attempting to decrease core temperature post-exercise, and as a method of pre-cooling prior to physical activity or heat exposure. The interaction between an elevated core temperature and the pathological demyelination can cause a transient nerve conduction block that leads to temporarily impaired physical and cognitive function. These effects translate to reduced patient <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> <b>performance</b> of ADLs, however there are viable prevention strategies. Behavioral strategies to minimize heat exposure include performing outdoor physical activity when temperatures are cooler, or installing an air conditioner.|$|E

The Exchange Control was abolished after the float of the Australian dollar occurred in 1983. In the five years after the Campbell Committee probe, 1979–1984, the financial system in Australia became deregulated. Another probe was the Wallis Committee in 1996, which took effect in 1998.

Grounded in the safety performance model, {{this study was conducted}} to examine the impact of psychological capital (PsyCap), which consists of the shared variance of hope, efficacy, resilience and optimism, and Past, Present, and Future thinking perspectives, on <b>safety</b> climate <b>and</b> <b>performance.</b> A nonexperimental quantitative design was used to determine whether PsyCap and thinking perspectives of construction project employees predicted safety performance and/or moderated the relationship between <b>safety</b> climate <b>and</b> <b>performance</b> across construction sites in different countries. 411 construction employees were recruited via a multistage and clustering strategy and took part in the study. The PsyCap Questionnaire, MindTime Profile Inventory, Group-Level <b>Safety</b> Climate Scale, <b>and</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Performance</b> Measure were used to assess PsyCap, thinking perspectives, <b>safety</b> climate, <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> <b>performance.</b> Multiple regression was used {{to determine the effects of}} PsyCap and thinking perspectives on <b>safety</b> climate <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> <b>performance.</b> Results showed that Future and Present thinking predicted PsyCap as well as <b>safety</b> climate <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> <b>performance</b> in the construction industry.

40|$|Sustainable {{building}} and construction practices in Malaysia are primarily aimed at improving the <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> health <b>performance</b> of buildings while minimizing its impact on resources and the natural environment. Thus, a comprehensive understanding {{of the factors that}} contribute to <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> health <b>performance</b> of our built environment is essential. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a building <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> health <b>performance</b> (BSHP) model, focusing on the <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> health <b>performance</b> factors of low cost housing in Malaysia. These factors include the architecture, building services, external environment, operation and maintenance, and management approaches. The influence of these factors on perceived personal responsibility towards adopting a BSHP model for low-cost housing in Malaysia was also studied. This study was undertaken in two stages. Firstly, literature on existing <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> health practices related to low-cost housing and facilities were reviewed to identify factors that influence health <b>and</b> <b>safety</b> <b>performance.</b> Quantitative data were gathered to assess the suitability of the factors based on experts judgement and survey. Data obtained were statistically examined using the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and the proposed model was identified. Secondly, quantitative data were gathered through a main survey involving 308 respondents to test the research model validity and the proposed hypothesis using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) tool. Results reveal that the five identified constructs have a direct positive effect on <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> health <b>performance,</b> as well as perceived personal responsibility. Furthermore, perceived personal responsibility (β = 0. 563) towards <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> health <b>performance</b> has the highest beta value, followed by building services (β = 0. 212), architecture (β = 0. 155), operation and maintenance (β = 0. 128), management approaches (β = 0. 124), and external environment (β = 0. 117). In testing the validity of models, results found BSHP model had a good model fit with R 2 of 0. 342 and in line with experts validation results. The BSHP model can inform the public of the relative risks regarding the <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> health of low cost housing. It can also help building owners, developers, and government bodies to develop more informed and socially responsible decisions to improve building <b>safety</b> <b>and</b> health <b>performance...</b>|$|R
