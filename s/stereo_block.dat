40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} a fast {{algorithm}} for computing stereo correspondences and correcting the mis-matches. The correspondences are computed using <b>stereo</b> <b>block</b> matching and refined with a depth-aware method. We compute 16 disparities {{at the same}} time using SSE instructions. We evaluated our method on the Middlebury benchmark and obtained promosing results for practical realtime applications. The use of SSE instructions allows us to reduce the time needed to process the Tsukuba stereo pair to 8 milliseconds (125 fps) on a Core i 5 CPU with 2 x 3. 3 GHz. Our disparity refinement method has corrected 40 % of the wrong matches with an additional computational time of 5. 2 % (0. 41 ms). The algorithm has been used to build 3 D occupancy grid maps from stereo images. We used the datasets provided by the EuRoC Robotic Challenge. The reconstruction was accurate enough to perform realtime safe navigation. I...|$|E
40|$|With {{regard to}} the feature that the {{vertical}} precision of SRTM(shuttle radar topography mission) data in the flat terrain area {{is much higher than}} its nominal precision, it is proposed that a <b>stereo</b> <b>block</b> adjustment algorithm without ground control by adopting SRTM data as elevation constraint. In order to improve overall vertical accuracy of the image, by constructing a wide local area network and setting intensive connecting points, SRTM is set as the initial vertical value of connecting points. In the process of adjustment calculation, ground height of connecting points distributing in the flat terrain area is made sure to rigorously approach to vertical accuracy of SRTM. Through the experiment employing ZY- 3 triple linear array stereo satellite images cover across all of Hubei province, the verification results prove that the method is effective. The height root mean square errors(RMSEs) of ZY- 3 stereo images is improved from 7. 2 m to 2. 0 m without ground control, and the RMSEs of flat areas and mountain areas improved to 1. 44 m and 3. 0 m respectively, which fulfills the elevation accuracy requirement of national 1 : 25 000 scale mapping applications...|$|E
50|$|For {{the channel}} {{coupling}} CELT may use M/S stereo or intensity <b>stereo.</b> <b>Blocks</b> {{can be described}} independent from adjacent frames (Intra-frame); for example to enable a decoder to jump into a running stream. With transform codecs so-called pre-echo artifacts can get audible, because the quantisation error of sharp, energy-heavy sounds (transients) can spread over the entire DCT block and the transient doesn't mask them backward in {{time as well as}} forward. With CELT each block can be further divided to thwart such artifacts.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} into the use of alternative sensor orientation models and their applicability for block adjustment of high-resolution satellite imagery is reported. Ikonos Geo imagery has been employed in the investigation, and since the explicit camera model and precise exterior orientation information required to apply conventional collinearity-based models is not provided with Ikonos data, alternative sensor orientation models are needed. The orientation models considered here are bias-corrected rational functions (with vendor-supplied rational polynomial coefficients) and the affine projection model. Test results arising from {{the application of the}} alternative image orientation/triangulation models within two multi-strip, <b>stereo</b> <b>blocks</b> of Geo imagery are reported. These results confirm that Geo imagery can yield three-dimensional geopositioning to pixel and even sub-pixel accuracy over areas of coverage extending well beyond the nominal single scene area for Ikonos. The accuracy achieved is not only consistent with expectations for rigorous sensor orientation models, but is also readily attainable in practice with {{only a small number of}} high-quality ground control points. 1...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, {{there is}} an {{increase}} in the usage of geometric 3 D models in movie industry, games and virtual environments. There are several existing solutions like user-driven models, 3 D scanners but they are not fully satisfying in either in terms of cost and or in efficiency. To overcome these problems, we have introduced a cost-effective solution based on analyzing image sequences. The main focus of this paper is on stereo vision, it is the process of recovering depth from camera images by comparing two or more views of the same scene. This paper mainly focuses on how to compute the depth map between two rectified stereo images. In this paper we use block matching, which is the standard algorithm for high-speed stereo vision in hardware systems. We first explore basic block matching, and then apply dynamic programming to improve accuracy, and image pyramiding to improve speed.

40|$|In {{the domain}} of image processing, often {{real-time}} constraints are required. In particular, in safety-critical applications, such as X-ray computed tomography in medical imaging or advanced driver assistance systems in the automotive domain, timing is of utmost importance. A common approach to maintain real-time capabilities of compute-intensive applications is to offload those computations to dedicated accelerator hardware, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Programming such architectures is a challenging task, {{with respect to the}} typical FPGA-specific design criteria: Achievable overall algorithm latency and resource usage of FPGA primitives (BRAM, FF, LUT, and DSP). High-Level Synthesis (HLS) dramatically simplifies this task by enabling the description of algorithms in well-known higher languages (C/C++) and its automatic synthesis that can be accomplished by HLS tools. However, algorithm developers still need expert knowledge about the target architecture, in order to achieve satisfying results. Therefore, in previous work, we have shown that elevating the description of image algorithms to an even higher abstraction level, by using a Domain-Specific Language (DSL), can significantly cut down the complexity for designing such algorithms for FPGAs. To give the developer even more control over the common trade-off, latency vs. resource usage, we will present an automatic optimization process where these criteria are analyzed and fed back to the DSL compiler, in order to generate code that is closer to the desired design specifications. Finally, we generate code for <b>stereo</b> <b>block</b> matching algorithms and compare it with handwritten implementations to quantify the quality of our results.

40|$|The Stična monastery is a {{monument}} of national importance. The monastery cloister needed some restoration work. Projects were prepared and restoration works {{were carried out}} between 1996 and 2004. The inappropriate and non-original plaster of {{the inner and outer}} walls of the cloister was removed in 2003. At that moment it was possible to make a photogrammetric survey and a protective recording of the stripped walls. The goal was to preserve all possible data about the walls before the new lime plaster was made. An unprofessional camera was used for the task. Each wall of the cloister was covered by forty-two shots (the cloister has eight walls, four inner and four outer walls surrounding the garden). The data have been preserved on film and transformed into digital form. Both forms are available for study, analysis and further processing. The acquired data represent a valuable contribution to the existing documentation and knowledge about this monument. The photographs were taken according to the recommendations for simple photogrammetric architectural survey denominated as 3 x 3 rules for architectural photogrammetry. In 1988, Martin Brunner defined in his diploma thesis the 3 x 3 Minimum Rules for Photogrammetry (secondary source: Herbig, Waldhäusl, 1997). They were updated and developed into the present form by Peter Waldhäusl, Cliff Ogleby and Ulrike Herbig. The use of these rules is recommended and supported by the International Committee for Architectural Photogrammetry (CIPA) ([URL] {{which is one of the}} international committees of ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites) and it was established in collaboration with ISPRS (International Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing). Its main purpose is the improvement of all methods for surveying of cultural monuments and sites under special consideration of pphotogrammetry. These so-called ˝ 3 x 3 rules˝ are structured into three geometrical rules, three photographic rules and three organizational rules. The aim of implementing the rules is to create a possibility for anyone to use their own camera for amateur photogrammetric <b>stereo</b> <b>block</b> documentation, which can even be used for restitution if needed later on. In this way there is a possibility to create or supplement documentation material on cultural heritage and in a way to preserve it for the future...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} recent interest in stereo correspondence algorithms {{for use in}} the urban automotive environment [1, 2, 3]. In this paper we evaluate a range of dense stereo algorithms, using a unique evaluation criterion which provides quantitative analysis of accuracy against range, based on ground truth 3 D annotated object information. The results show that while some algorithms provide greater scene coverage, we see little differentiation in accuracy over short ranges, while the converse is shown over longer ranges. Within our long range accuracy analysis we see a distinct separation of relative algorithm performance. This study extends prior work on dense <b>stereo</b> evaluation of <b>Block</b> Matchin...|$|R
40|$|Since its {{launch in}} September of 1999, the IKONOS {{satellite}} {{has been consistently}} providing high quality 1 -meter panchromatic and 4 -meter multispectral images. Accurate interior and exterior orientation enable IKONOS to achieve high geometric accuracy with or without ground control. Exterior orientation is determined by on-board GPS receivers, star trackers, gyros, and interlock angles. Post-processing of GPS data with software incorporating sophisticated filtering and orbital modeling algorithms results in accurate ephemeris. Kalman filtering of gyro and star tracker data results in optimal combination of lower frequency star tracker attitude data exhibiting high absolute accuracy with high frequency gyro data being very accurate over short time intervals. Interlock angles relate the attitude and the camera coordinate systems and have been calibrated both pre-launch and in-flight. Initial interior orientation parameter values were determined by pre-launch measurements and later refined by in-flight calibration. In this paper, we shall first demonstrate the high accuracy of such calibrations based on test range data. Later, we shall quantify the geometric accuracy of the IKONOS camera using large IKONOS <b>stereo</b> image <b>blocks</b> with and without ground control, thus validating the exterior and the interior orientation calibrations. 1...|$|R
40|$|Current {{teleconferencing}} configuration {{and synthesis}} solutions {{tend to be}} rigid and system specific.

MVS contains two separate processes: surface segmentation, which identifies surfaces, and surface selection and merging, which selects and integrates the best view of a required surface into the virtual view. The surfaces are identified via a sampling density function while the surface selection procedure is based on a weighting scheme. This unique teleconferencing system is both scalable: depending on the display size and number of conferees SCABs can be added or removed, and modular: the MVS process being dynamic enough to produce virtual views from a multiple SCAB set-up...|$|R
