5|$|The {{administration}} of Mashonaland {{did not immediately}} prove profitable for the Company or its investors, {{partly because of the}} costly police force, which Rhodes dramatically downsized in 1891 to <b>save</b> <b>money.</b> There also existed the problem of land ownership; Britain recognised the Company's subsoil rights in Mashonaland, but not its possession of the land itself, and the Company therefore could not grant titles to land or accept rents and other payments from farmers.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Baker {{lost much}} of his savings in the Panic of 1907 and could only afford to send {{one of his sons}} to college.

5|$|During {{the early}} years of the show, Fox network {{officials}} forced the staff of The Simpsons to produce clip shows in order to <b>save</b> <b>money.</b> Originally, the producers were ordered to produce four clip show per season in order to meet episode limits imposed by the network. Fox network officials reasoned that clip shows could be produced at half the cost of a normal episode, but syndication rights could be sold at full price. The staff, however, felt such a large number of clip shows would alienate fans of the series.|$|E

5|$|Kripke was {{developing}} the concept {{for ten years}} before it was greenlit as a television series. Before it could be filmed, the script underwent numerous revisions. The episode was produced in Los Angeles, though future episodes were filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, to <b>save</b> <b>money.</b> The episode established the series' tradition of a rock-music soundtrack, and included background music scored by Kripke's friend Christopher Lennertz.
