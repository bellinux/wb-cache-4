However, electromagnetic coupling between copper-lines in the same binder, {{also referred to as}} crosstalk is known to result in a huge performance degradation in DSL access networks. To tackle the crosstalk problem, one can resort to two types of crosstalk mitigation techniques: (1) dynamic spectrum management (DSM), also referred to as spectrum balancing, which optimizes the transmit power spectra of the individual users in the network, to reduce the degradation caused by crosstalk. Various DSM algorithms have been developed, including centralized algorithms[2 – 4], distributed algorithms[5, 6], and autonomous algorithms[7, 8]. (2) Crosstalk cancellation, which is also referred to as vectored DSL or signal coordination, and includes upstream crosstalk cancellation and downstream precoding or pre-compensation. These techniques remove the crosstalk between the users through digital signal processing (DSP). Vectored DSL is seen as a very promising technique, and is <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> a <b>standardization</b> procedure <b>of</b> the international telecommunication union (ITU)[9, 10]. The vectored DSL system has been studied in[11 – 16]. In[12 – 16] simple linear zero-forcing crosstalk cancellation schemes have been proposed that reduce the crosstalk cancellation computational complexity by only removing the dominant crosstalk in the system. This is also referred to as partial crosstalk cancellation (PCC).|$|R

Background: VIMS was the <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> recent <b>standardization</b> activities, but {{the effects of}} OKN have not been studied {{in the absence of}} vection. Method: Experiment 1 suppressed OKN by eye fixation and examined VIMS severity (both ordinal and ratio scale) and time spent in saturated vection at four pattern rotating velocities of 0, 2, 14, and 34 degrees per second (dps). Experiment 2 suppressed vection by adding a peripheral visual field rotating in the opposite direction to the rotating patterns. VIMS severity and OKN slow-phase velocity were studied at four rotating velocities of 0, 30, 60, and 90 dps. Results: Results from Experiment 1 indicated that VIMS severity increased as the pattern velocity increased from 0 dps to 34 dps. Results from Experiment 2 indicated that as the velocity of the rotating pattern increased, the slow-phase velocity of OKN and the severity of VIMS increased and peaked in the 60 -dps condition. In both experiments, ratio-scaled nausea data significantly correlated with ordinal-scaled nausea ratings. Conclusion: VIMS can still occur in the absence of either vection or OKN. Interestingly, the profile of the summed results of the two experiments matches nicely with the profile reported by Hu et al. in which neither OKN nor vection were controlled. Application: Potential applications include modeling and reduction of VIMS in computer gaming environments. Copyright © 2009, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

This technique is being studied in numerous research projects and is the <b>subject</b> <b>of</b> a <b>standardization</b> work within the IEEE 802. 15. 3 a task group. UWB systems are characterised by a radio signal whose fractional bandwidth, i. e the ratio between 3 -dB bandwidth and center frequency, is greater than 25 % and by a very low radiated power (− 41. 3 dBm/MHz at most, by FCC requirements [1]). UWB systems cover a spectrum of several gigahertz and the transmitted pulses are very short, {{in the order of}} a few nanoseconds. For these kind of pulses, antennas act as pulse shaping filters for which the impulse response depends on the direction of arrival (DoA) of the received waveform. During the standardization work in IEEE 802. 15. 3 a, a new UWB channel model was proposed, following the Saleh-Valenzuela cluster model [2] with some modifications [3]. The model is parameterised in four scenarios describing different communication situations, e. g., line-of-sight (LOS) or non line-of-sight (NLOS) communication and shadowing effect. A model for the direction of arrival was proposed in [4]. Combining these two models, we obtained a description of the channel suitable for including antennas in the system model. The antenna is modeled using a bank of discrete FIR filters with one filter for each direction of arrival. The antenna under study is a UWB monocone antenna designed at ENSTA as reported in [5]...|$|R
