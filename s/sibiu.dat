5|$|Brașov and its surroundings, {{including}} the city's Black Church, were severely affected. According to local chronicles, {{in the village}} of Bod, more than 50 houses and several churches were damaged or destroyed. In Feldioara, a column of water rose several meters into the air from a crack caused by the earthquake. Buildings collapsed in <b>Sibiu,</b> {{including the}} city's Catholic church.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the fall}} of Antonescu's regime and the {{campaign}} to recover Northern Transylvania, Agârbiceanu became a contributor to a new political weekly, Ardealul. He remained in <b>Sibiu</b> until 1945 {{and then returned to}} Cluj. He also contributed, in 1947, a religious tract on Familia creștină ("The Christian Family").|$|E
5|$|After 1529, {{resistance}} to John I in Transylvania was broken {{in a series}} of small campaigns. For instance, the last Transylvanian magnate to side with Ferdinánd I, Stephen Majláth went over to John I in early 1532, and <b>Sibiu</b> was occupied in 1536. On February 24, 1538, a secret pact was signed in Oradea by the representatives of the two kings of Hungary. According to the treaty, both rulers were allowed to retain the territories which they then held, but the childless John I promised to recognize the Habsburgs' succession.|$|E
5|$|After the Romanian Revolution, many firing ranges and {{training}} areas {{were closed and}} abandoned {{due to lack of}} funds. Currently, the military schools {{and training}} units of the Romanian Land Forces are directly subordinated to the central headquarters. There are 3 military high schools (Câmpulung Moldovenesc, Alba Iulia and Breaza), five military academies , one officers school (Piteşti), 3 training schools (<b>Sibiu,</b> Piteşti, Buzău) and 9 training battalions.|$|E
5|$|Committed {{to social}} and {{cultural}} activism in Transylvania, Agârbiceanu spent the 1910s officiating near <b>Sibiu,</b> with a break during World War I that eventually took him deep into Ukraine. In 1919, he moved to Cluj, where he lived {{for most of the}} remainder of his life. After the war, he involved himself in both the political and cultural life of Greater Romania. He was voted into the Romanian Academy and assumed the office of Senate vice president under the National Renaissance Front dictatorship.|$|E
5|$|In 1479, Báthory {{was made}} {{governor}} of Transylvania and in late August 1479, an Ottoman expedition from Bosnia, commanded by twelve pashas, invaded Transylvania {{with a force}} of 43,000 men. The Turks moved very quickly through the land while pillaging it, giving Báthory little time to gather his militia at <b>Sibiu.</b> Pál Kinizsi, the Ban of Timişoara, promised to aid Báthory. As Báthory approached Sebeş, Ali Bey, one of the Turkish pashas, had raised camp on a plain between Mureş and Sebeş, totally unaware that Kinizsi was also on his way against him.|$|E
5|$|Interest in the Volunteer Corps' {{activity}} was only revived after the Romanian Revolution of 1989. Among the relics {{left behind by}} the Corps is Dimitrie Lăzărel's banner, probably the only one of seven to have survived. In 1923, Lăzărel paraded it at the Volunteers' Union reunion in Arad. Referred to as the Darnița Banner, it was donated to a local church, then exhibited by the Museum of Banat, Timișoara. The Kishinev flag was donated by the Corps to ASTRA National Museum Complex of <b>Sibiu.</b>|$|E
5|$|Matthias {{made his}} state entry into Buda five days later. He ceremoniously {{sat on the}} throne in the Church of Our Lady, but was not crowned, because the Holy Crown of Hungary {{had been in the}} {{possession}} of Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor for almost two decades. The 14-year-old monarch administered state affairs independently from the outset, although he reaffirmed his uncle's position as Regent. For instance, Matthias instructed the citizens of Nagyszeben (now <b>Sibiu</b> in Romania) to reconcile their differences with Vlad Dracula, Prince of Wallachia on 3 March.|$|E
5|$|The kings {{exempted}} {{some communities}} from {{the jurisdiction of}} the voivodes. The Diploma Andreanum, a royal charter of 1224, placed the territory of the Saxons between Broos (Szászváros, Orăștie) and Barót (Baraolt) under the authority of the Count of Hermannstadt (Nagyszeben, <b>Sibiu),</b> who was appointed by and directly subordinate to the monarchs. Likewise, a special royal official, the Count of the Székelys, administered the Székely community from around 1228. In the latter case, the two offices were united by custom in 1462: from then on each voivode was also appointed Count of the Székelys.|$|E
5|$|Born in Cenade {{village in}} Transylvania's Alba County (at {{the time in}} Alsó-Fehér County), Agârbiceanu was the second of eight children; his parents were Nicolae and Ana (née Olariu). His father and {{grandfather}} were both woodcutters, while he believed his great-grandparents were cowherds, {{as indicated by the}} surname of his grandfather, Vasile , who originated in the <b>Sibiu</b> area. The name Agârbiceanu came from the family's ancestral village, Agârbiciu. According to the novelist's own notes, his father was literate and subscribed to a number of Romanian-language publications that appeared in Transylvania. His mother, although a great lover of stories and storytelling, was illiterate.|$|E
5|$|Creangă's {{name was}} {{assigned}} to several education institutions, among them Bucharest's Ion Creangă National College, and to an annual prize granted by the Romanian Academy. There is a Ion Creangă commune, in Neamț County, and streets or squares were also named in the writer's honor in cities throughout Romania: Târgu Neamț, Iași, Fălticeni, Bucharest, Arad, Brăila, Brașov, Cluj-Napoca, Craiova, Drobeta-Turnu Severin, Oradea, Ploiești, <b>Sibiu,</b> Suceava, Târgu Mureș, Tecuci, Timișoara, Tulcea, etc. A quarter in northern Bucharest, near Colentina, is also named Ion Creangă. Creangă's name {{was assigned to}} several landmarks and institutions in post-Soviet Moldova. Among them is the Ion Creangă Pedagogical State University, founded {{on the basis of}} Chișinău's normal school.|$|E
5|$|In late 1938, {{following}} {{the establishment of}} the National Renaissance Front (FRN), King Carol II appointed him to the Senate, of which he also served as vice president. From 1938 to 1940, he edited a new edition of Tribuna in Cluj, as both the FRN's official paper and Transylvania's only daily. Toward the end of the 1930s, he wrote in opposition to the revisionist policy of the Kingdom of Hungary, and in August 1940, after the Second Vienna Award granted Northern Transylvania to Hungary, he fled Cluj for <b>Sibiu.</b> The new authorities called for his expulsion, but he received the order after he had departed Cluj.|$|E
5|$|Pascu was {{a native}} of Agnita (at the time part of Braşov Region, now in <b>Sibiu</b> County), where he {{graduated}} from primary school. He was born to an ethnic Romanian father and a half-Hungarian mother; on his mother's side, he was also the descendant of Poles and Slovaks. His mother was a Roman Catholic and his father, like Gyuri, was a Romanian Orthodox. His name reflects his complex heritage: Ioan was chosen as his Romanian name; his second name was the Hungarian Gyurika, but it was recorded as Ghiurico in his birth certificate and personal documents ever since—as Pascu later indicated, this was because neither his father nor the notary were familiar with Hungarian phonology. Pascu, who was fluent in the Hungarian language, preferred the hypocoristic Gyuri.|$|E
5|$|Agârbiceanu visited Bucharest, the Old Kingdom capital, in 1906, {{and sent}} {{enthusiastic}} travel notes for Unirea. He became {{a regular contributor}} to the Bucharest nationalist review Sămănătorul, which gave De la țară a sonorous welcome, and later to Sămănătoruls leftist rival, Viața Românească. From 1909, he {{was also one of the}} regulars at Neamul Românesc. For his literary activity, he was elected a corresponding member of Astra in 1912, and was promoted to full membership in 1925. From 1910 to 1919, he was parish priest at Orlat in <b>Sibiu</b> County. Agârbiceanu was also a member of Austria-Hungary's Romanian National Party (PNR), and supported PNR youth leader Octavian Goga, his colleague at Luceafărul and Tribuna. In 1910, he followed Goga as he parted from the PNR and launched his own independent faction.|$|E
5|$|Albert of Habsburg (who was Sigismund of Luxembourg's {{son-in-law}} and successor) wrote {{a letter}} to Vlad, ordering him to protect Transylvania. Ignoring the king's command, Vlad joined Murad II who came to Wallachia at the head of his army in summer 1438, serving the sultan as his guide. The Ottoman and Wallachian troops broke into Hungary at Orșova. They routed the army of a local Vlach kenez, Cândea, near Hațeg. They marched along the river Mureș, capturing Câlnic and Sebeș. At Sebeș, Vlad convinced the leaders of the town to give in without resistance, promising to protect their property if they accompanied him to Wallachia. The Ottomans and Wallachians laid siege to <b>Sibiu,</b> but the siege lasted only for 8 days. They destroyed the outskirts of Brașov, before they left Hungary loaded with plunder and taking more than 30,000 captives.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, at the <b>Sibiu</b> Conference of 26 April/8 May 1848, Transylvanian revolutionaries {{had also}} adopted a blue-white-red {{national}} flag (vertical, {{according to the}} memoirs of George Bariţ). It was emblazoned with the words “VIRTUTEA ROMANĂ REÎNVIATĂ” (“ROMAN VIRTUE RESURRECTED”). A number of contemporary sources attests these colors (including the Blaj newspaper Organul naţionale and Alexandru Papiu Ilarian’s Istorie a românilor din Dacia superioară). They had a twofold significance: their importance in Romanian costume and their union of the Transylvanian principality’s old colors (blue and red) with the white symbolizing peace. It appears that the two specimens with blue-yellow-red stripes preserved today at the National Museum of Romanian History were made later to commemorate the events at Blaj; yellow replaced white {{as a symbol of}} Romanian Transylvanians’ desire to join Romania.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, Cluj {{suffered}} from great calamities, suffering from epidemics of the plague and devastating fires. The {{end of this}} century brought the end of Turkish sovereignty, but found the city bereft of much of its wealth, municipal freedom, cultural centrality, political significance and even population. It gradually regained its important position within Transylvania as the headquarters of the Gubernium and the Diets between 1719 and 1732, and again from 1790 until the revolution of 1848, when the Gubernium moved to Nagyszeben (Hermannstadt), present-day <b>Sibiu).</b> In 1791, a group of Romanian intellectuals drew up a petition, known as Supplex Libellus Valachorum, which was sent to the Emperor in Vienna. The petition demanded the equality of the Romanian nation in Transylvania in respect to the other nations (Saxon, Szekler and Hungarian) governed by the Unio Trium Nationum, but it was rejected by the Diet of Cluj.|$|E
5|$|The Székelys were a {{community}} of privileged border guards. They fought in the royal army, {{for which they were}} exempted from taxation. A royal official, the count of the Székelys, was their supreme leader, but the Székely seats were administered by elected officials. The Saxons also had the right to elect the magistrates of their seats. They enjoyed personal freedom and paid a lump sum tax to the monarchs. The wealthiest Saxon towns – Bistritz, Hermannstadt and Kronstadt (Bistrița, <b>Sibiu</b> and Brașov) – owned large estates which were cultivated by hundreds of peasants. Dozens of Saxons and Székely families held landed property in the counties, for which they also enjoyed the status of noblemen. Saxon and Székely leaders were occasionally invited to Torda to attend the general assemblies, which enabled the leaders of the three nations to coordinate their actions.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of Chiprovtsi from a mining town to a trade hub owes {{much to the}} settlement of merchants from the Republic of Ragusa (today Dubrovnik, Croatia) {{and the quality of}} the local metalworking, as well as the lack of permanent Ottoman presence and the privileges enjoyed by the population. By the mid-17th century, mining was in decline, as the silver deposits had been all but exhausted (in 1666 there remained only 16 iron smelteries), forcing the population to seek a more profitable occupation. Since 1659, the Ragusan merchants from Provadiya altered their traditional route to Dubrovnik through Sofia in order to visit Chiprovtsi. The local residents produced and traded with leather, carpets, fabrics, clothes, remarkable gold and silver jewellery, metal tools, cattle, etc. Initially, the Chiprovtsi merchants would only visit Vidin, Pirot, Sofia and Vratsa. Later, however, they appeared at the markets in Istanbul, Thessaloniki, Bucharest, Odessa, Braşov, <b>Sibiu,</b> Belgrade, Buda and Pest, with a particularly strong presence in Wallachia and Transylvania, where they established permanent agencies and sizable companies in Târgovişte, Câmpulung and Râmnic during the rule of Matei Basarab (1632–1654). The international trade broadened the outlook of the locals and introduced the ideas of the age and the European culture of the time to the region.|$|E

25|$|<b>Sibiu</b> is an {{important}} node in the European road network, being on two different European routes (E68 and E81). At a national level, <b>Sibiu</b> is located on three different main national roads, DN1, DN7 and DN14.|$|E
25|$|Equivalent to Denmark, Norway and the Netherlands. It is {{an island}} chain nation off of the {{southern}} coast of Derlavai. Its people are Algarvic in blood, but it allies against Algarve. <b>Sibiu,</b> {{a member of the}} initial coalition, was overrun in a surprise attack by Algarve {{in the first year of}} the war, and freed in the third year of the war. It is mentioned that some 300 to 250 years in the past <b>Sibiu</b> fought a series of naval wars with Lagoas, over trade and control of the sea. <b>Sibiu</b> is named after a town in Transylvania. The capital of <b>Sibiu</b> is Tirgoviste. Sibian names are drawn from Romanian.|$|E
25|$|The first {{official}} record {{referring to the}} <b>Sibiu</b> area comes from 1191, when Pope Celestine III confirmed {{the existence of the}} free prepositure of the German settlers in Transylvania, the prepositure having its headquarters in <b>Sibiu,</b> named Cibinium at that time.|$|E
25|$|After {{graduating from}} the Faculty of Physics of the Babeș-Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca in 1983, Iohannis worked {{as a high school}} physics teacher at various schools and colleges in <b>Sibiu,</b> including, from 1989 to 1997, the Samuel von Brukenthal Gymnasium in <b>Sibiu,</b> the oldest German-speaking school in Romania. From 1997 to 1999, he was Deputy General School Inspector of <b>Sibiu</b> County, and from 1999 until his {{election}} as mayor in 2000, he was the General School Inspector, head of public schools in the county.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-16th century, Conrad Haas wrote a {{book that}} {{described}} rocket technology that combined fireworks and weapons technologies. This manuscript was discovered in 1961, in the <b>Sibiu</b> public records (<b>Sibiu</b> public records Varia II 374). His work dealt with the theory of motion of multi-stage rockets, different fuel mixtures using liquid fuel, and introduced delta-shape fins and bell-shaped nozzles.|$|E
25|$|Since 2007, a {{traditional}} Christmas market is {{held for the}} first time in <b>Sibiu,</b> Romania.|$|E
25|$|Iohannis {{established}} {{contacts with}} foreign officials and investors. <b>Sibiu</b> was declared the European Capital of Culture of 2007, along with Luxembourg (the bearer {{of the distinction}} in 1995). Luxembourg chose to share this honourable status with <b>Sibiu</b> {{due to the fact}} that many of the Transylvanian Saxons emigrated in the 12th century to Transylvania from the area where Luxembourg is today. <b>Sibiu,</b> or Hermannstadt in German, was built by the Transylvanian Saxons, was for many centuries the cultural centre of that group, and was a predominantly German-speaking city until the mid 20th century. Many Germans left the city after World War II, and especially in 1990, within months of the fall of the Iron Curtain.|$|E
