40|$|A {{shrink-fit}} is a semi-permanent assembly system, {{widely used}} in industry, {{which is designed to}} resist the relative movement or transmit torque between two components. This done by creating high radial pressures at the interface of the constituent parts. Examples include fitting of gears to shafts to transmit torque and <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> hard wearing sleeves to shafts for steel rolling mills. This paper presents measured and predicted residual stresses from a variety of <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> assemblies, including aluminium alloys, stainless steel and cast irons. In a number of cases the sleeves <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> to the shaft were subjected to prior machining or prior quenching to introduce initial residual stresses in the sleeve. Residual stresses were measured using a combination of deep-hole drilling (DHD) and incremental centre hole drilling (ICHD) techniques. The ICHD method provided near surface residual stress measurements to depths up to about 1 mm. The DHD method measured through thickness residual stresses along radial lines through the outer sleeve and into the shaft up to depths of 400 mm. Results are shown for a variety of assemblies and reveal residual stress that are significantly different from both simple analysis and finite element studies. For example, prior machining introduced near surface compressive residual stresses, that is then expected to be counteracted by the near surface tensile shrink fit residual stresses.

In both cases, at any given compacting load, the design should minimise dimensions and stresses. The design targets are minimum die size, optimum intermediate diameter and optimum interference, with maximum stresses on each die item lower than those allowable for the selected materials. In dual mode, for fixed overall dimension, intermediate diameters and shrink fitting interference should enable to maximise the compacting load without exceeding the allowable maximum stresses. In {{the first part of}} this work, for cylindrical shapes (circular profile dies) and axisymmetric plane stress problems, dimensions, interferences and stress–strain states have been analytically calculated to optimise doubly <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> dies in the abovementioned sense. In the second part, the same evaluations for axisymmetric generic problems have been carried out by finite element method (FEM) approach integrated in an optimisation procedure. The minimum overall dimensions of the die are presented as a function of the ratio between applied load and maximum allowable stress. Corresponding interferences and optimum diameters have been calculated. Some approximate equations for a quick and handy optimisation are presented. The differences between analytical and numerical results obviously depend on the consideration of the actually stressed length, or compact height, and total die height.

40|$|The <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> shaft to hub connection, loaded under bending, {{experiences}} Fretting Fatigue {{at the end}} of {{the contact}} where both stress concentration and microslip are acting. <b>Shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> testing is not standard and common as the bridge type test, however, the round geometry implies no edge effect, the shrinkage and the bending loads can be carefully controlled with strain gages, and the stress distribution easily calculated with finite element analyses. Though the shrink fit compressive state, the cyclic bending introduces tensile stresses, hence the introduction of compressive residual stresses can play a significant role to prevent the initiation and the propagation of the fretting fatigue cracks. Experimental results are reported in the paper where the fretting fatigue strength was remarkably improved after a deep rolling treatment. Numerical analyses even predicted the complete mode I closure of potential fretting fatigue cracks by taking into account the compressive residual stresses. SEM investigation showed how the crack pattern was significantly different with deep rolling, having multiple crack initiation sites and then either coalescence or crack branching. From the modelling point of view, the paper shows that the self-arrest theory cannot be used to assess the fretting fatigue strength, for deep rolled specimens, where the crack remains closed. A better prediction can be obtained with a critical plane multiaxial fatigue criterion, based on the shear stress amplitude, which under a compressive stress state can be more effectively assumed as the driving force of the crack. Consistently the orientation of the plane experiencing the maximum shear stress amplitude was found in agreement with the observed initial crack direction...|$|E

40|$|On {{one hand}} rotor shafts of wind {{turbines}} {{seem to be}} larger and heavier than they need to be, {{due to a lack}} of empirical data from full scale fatigue testing and a compensation through safety factors. On the other hand wear mechanisms at the contact region between the rotor shaft and the <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> inner ring of the main bearing can be observed. These wear mechanisms are also known from other industries. Shear stresses in the contact region that result from the rotating bending moment at the rotor shaft eventually overcome the frictional connection and lead to a relative motion between rotor shaft and inner ring. These relative motions can cause surface deterioration and thus a degradation of the fatigue strength of the component. The components life span, estimated by common life time assessment methods, will decrease unnoticed. To investigate both the fatigue behavior of the whole component and wear mechanisms a full scale fatigue test has to be carried out. This paper will deal with the common assessment of the fatigue life of rotor shafts as well as the different wear mechanisms and it will show how those and other boundary conditions influence the test strategy for a full scale fatigue test of the rotor shaft...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Railway {{wheels are}} secured onto the axle {{by means of}} an {{interference}} fit. The wheel is either <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> or press fitted onto a pre-lubricated axle, and the resulting interference fit induces a contact pressure at the interface. Occasionally railway axles fail by fatigue, with the initiation point for the failure frequently traced to the interference fit. In this study, the reflection of ultrasound was used to determine contact conditions in the interference fit. It is a non-intrusive technique preserving the mechanics of the contact. The concept is simple; an acoustic wave bounces back from an incomplete interface. The higher the contact load, the more conformal the contact and hence more of the wave will be transmitted. A spring model is used to determine maps of contact stiffness from ultrasonic reflection data. A calibration procedure is then used to determine the pressure. Two types of wheelsets were used for the measurements, both with a hollow axle that was used as an access point for the ultrasonic transducer. The wheels differed in the design of their web sections. Variations were detected in the determined interface pressure profiles, due to both surface roughness effects and discontinuities in the fit geometry. When comparing the two fits, it was found that material removal from the web of the wheel in the second fit reduced the interface pressure distribution...|$|E
40|$|Axisymmetric {{analysis}} of cylindrical contacts is {{considered in the}} context of axisymmetric assemblies such as shrink-fits. Fretting fatigue induces sub-critical cracks along the contact interface of press fits especially when they are subjected to vibration. The surface and near surface stresses {{play a major role in}} the fretting fatigue crack initiation process. Assuming near surface contact stresses to be largely independent of the actual geometry of components in contact, half-plane analyses and experimental results obtained from a strip configuration are often cited in the literature to predict and understand crack initiation in the actual components (ASTM STP 1425). This thesis starts with half plane and strip models for cylindrical contact such as in a <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> shaft. Different traction profiles underpinning a typical fretting contact constitute a study of different geometrical parameters and friction coefficients. The cylindrical <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> contact is considered using mixed boundary formulation. The different cases of contact such as full slip, partial stick-slip and full stick are considered. A formulation for cyclically varying tractions is attempted using dynamic elasticity. Finally, the problem of cylindrical cracks is highlighted to understand interface delamination in a fiber reinforced composite. Stress functions in conjunction with Fourier transforms are used for analysis. Dynamic potentials based on Helmholtz decomposition are used for dynamic loading. For static loading Love’s stress function is used for axisymmetric problems while Airy’s stress function is used for 2 D problems. Solution procedures for solving traction boundary and mixed boundary conditions are described. Preliminary experiments are described to appreciate the contact stresses and crack initiation in cylindrical contact. Photoelastic fringes in a cylinder under a band of pressure illustrate fretting contact stresses concentrated close to the surface with the core of the cylinder relatively unstressed. Further, some material testing experiments using a specially designed cylindrical fretting rig demonstrated typical features of fretting fatigue crack initiation for providing the theoretical motivation. Fretting fatigue induces the initiation of a number of sub critical cracks along the contact interface of components in mechanical assemblies especially under vibration. The dominant crack among the initiated cracks may grow in size to the critical length in the presence of bulk cyclic loading finally resulting in fracture of the entire component. Fretting fatigue leads to unexpected failure of the component well below the expected life. It is therefore, critical to analyse, detect and control fretting. The blade root-disk joint in gas turbines as a critical example of fretting fatigue has spurred extensive research effort. There is relatively little literature available on cylindrical fretting in <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> joint focused in this thesis. Analytical solutions for static fretting tractions are presented using both axisymmetric and plane elastic stress functions for later comparison. While Fourier transforms in conjunction with Airys stress functions are exploited for attacking plane problems, Loves axisymmetric stress functions are explored for cylindrical fretting. Near surface stresses are of great interest in fretting fatigue research. Although two dimensional models provide general understanding of stresses caused during fretting, these models become inadequate to explain the interaction of local stresses with the bulk stresses inevitably present in cylindrical components. Global stress analysis tools are desirable for estimating the fatigue life of components experiencing fretting. While numerical techniques immensely aid fatigue life estimation they have their limitation when it comes to coated components. Stress {{analysis of}} coated cylinders unveils the intricate influence of the elastic mismatch as well as the width of the loading for varying friction coefficients. Comparison of results obtained from axisymmetric elasticity with plane elasticity is discussed in detail. The validity and scope of relying on plane fretting results to cylindrical fretting contacts is examined by comparing the results obtained for three different traction profiles. Fretting is generally modeled as a stress boundary value problem wherein the normal and frictional shear stresses are prescribed on the cylindrical surface. In reality fretting generally turns out to be a mixed boundary value problem with unknown regions of stick and slip requiring prescribing traction and displacement simultaneously. This belongs to a formidable class of unsolved contact mechanics problems in cylindrical axisymmetric elasticity. The famous spherical axisymmetric Hertz problem has no cylindrical counterpart except in the limiting case of a cylinder of large radius. These aspects are investigated for studying the hub-shaft interfacial geometry. A conformal contact profile is considered to model a shrink fit; the contact pressure is zero at the ends of contact. The case of full slip condition is analysed assuming a frictionless contact. With friction, partial stick-slip condition is analysed. The unknown contact traction is resolved in terms of Chebyshev expansions whose unknown coefficients are solved using Schmidt method. The unknown contact length and stick zone length are determined through an iterative procedure. A rigid uneven undulating axisymmetric hub in total contact over an elastic shaft under full stick condition is analysed for obtaining the near surface stresses for a given value of hub penetration. Even though the stresses oscillate in fretting, almost all the analyses reported in the literature use static formulation. Understanding this need, a dynamic analysis for modeling fretting of a cylinder subjected to harmonic pressure and shear is attempted. The Pochhammer dispersion relation becomes a prerequisite for a dynamic analysis. The results show that the stresses do not decay away from the contact, in contrast to the static results. This shows the propagation of stresses along the axial direction. Further extension of the dynamic analysis to a layered cylinder is also described. The results obtained on contact stresses and contact tractions under the cylindrical contact represent a significant advance to the literature for modeling fretting fatigue crack initiation and propagation. Formulating cylindrical crack problems is somewhat similar to cylindrical contacts. Such cylindrical cracks arise from the debonding along the fiber-matrix interface of a composite. A unified formulation for the problem of a pressurised cylindrical crack as also a pair of 2 D parallel cracks in infinite media is attempted using Love’s stress function in conjunction with Fourier transforms. The results obtained for stress intensity factors, strain energy release rate, mode mixity, crack opening and sliding displacements are compared with that of a 2 D pair of parallel cracks obtained using the unified formulation. The asymptotic situation of a large crack length to spacing ratio is examined in detail. In the case of a pair of parallel cracks, this implies a single crack in mode-I as far as the total energy release rate is concerned while at the same time retaining an asymptotic value for the mode mixity. This unique feature of near field mixed mode blending smoothly to mode-I in the far field is also seen for the stress field around a symmetrically branched crack. Thus, this thesis presents a collection of cylindrical elastostatic and elastodynamic axisymmetric solutions to provide better understanding of fretting and delamination problems encountered in press fit assemblies...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} experimental and theoretical study of subsynchronous rotordynamic instability in rotors caused by interference and shrink fit interfaces. The experimental studies show {{the presence of}} strong unstable subsynchronous vibrations in two different rotor setups with interference and shrink fit interfaces that were operated above their first critical speeds. The unstable vibrations occur at the first natural frequency of the rotor-bearing system. The instability caused complete wreckage of the test rig {{in one of the}} setups showing that these vibrations are potentially dangerous to the safe operation of rotating machines. The two different rotor setups that are studied are a single-disk rotor mounted on a uniform diameter shaft and a two-disk rotor with an aluminum sleeve <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> to it at the outer surface of the two disks. In the single-disk rotor, an adjustable interference arrangement between the disk and the shaft is obtained through a tapered sleeve arrangement, which acts as the interference fit joint. The unstable sub-synchronous vibrations originate from slippage in the shrink fit and the interference fit interfaces that develop friction forces, which act as destabilizing cross-coupled moments when the rotor is operated above its first critical speed. The unique contribution offered through this work is the experimental validation of a physically correct model of internal friction which models the destabilizing mechanism as a system of cross-coupled internal moments at the shrink fit interface. The dissertation describes stability simulations of various test rotor setups using the correct internal moments model. A commercial finite-element based software called XLTRCTM is used to perform rotordynamic simulations for stability studies. The method of stability study is the computation of eigenvalues of the rotor-bearing system. A negative real part of the eigenvalue indicates instability. The simulations include the test rotors that were experimentally observed as stable and unstable with shrink and interference fit interfaces in their assemblies. The dissertation also describes the simulations of various imagined rotor configurations with shrink fit interfaces, and seeks to explain how configurations differ on rotordynamic stability depending upon several rotor-bearing parameters such as geometry and elastic properties, as well as upon the amount of internal friction parameters, which differ from configuration to configuration...|$|E

The McTronX {{research}} {{group at the}} North–West University designs and develops Active Magnetic Bearings (AMBs). The group’s focus shifted to the design and development of AMB supported drive systems. This includes the electromagnetic and mechanical design of the electric machine, AMBs, auxiliary bearings {{as well as the}} development of the control system. The {{research group}} is currently developing an AMB supported high speed Induction Machine (IM) drive system that will facilitate tests in order to verify the design capability of the group. The research presented in this thesis describes the mechanical design and manufacturing of a high speed IM rotor section. The design includes; selecting the IM rotor topology, material selection, detail stress analysis and selecting appropriate manufacturing and assembly procedures. A comprehensive literature study identifies six main design considerations during the mechanical design of a high speed IM rotor section. These considerations include; magnetic core selection, rotor cage design, shaft design, shaft/magnetic core connection, stress due to operation at elevated temperatures and design for manufacture and assemble (DFMA). A critical overview of the literature leads to some design decisions being made and is used {{as a starting point for}} the detail design. The design choices include using a laminated cage rotor with a shrink fit for the shaft/magnetic core connection. Throughout the detail design an iterative process was followed incorporating both electromagnetic and mechanical considerations to deliver a good design solution. The first step of the iterative design process was, roughly calculating the material strengths required for first iteration material selection followed by more detailed interference fit calculations. From the detail stress analysis it became apparent that the stress in the IM rotor section cannot be calculated accurately using analytical methods. Consequently, a systematically verified and validated Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model was used to calculate the interferences required for each component. The detail stress analysis of the assembly also determined the allowable manufacturing dimensional tolerances. From the detail stress analysis it was found that the available lamination and squirrel cage material strengths were inadequate for the design speed specification of 27, 000 r/min. The analysis showed that a maximum operating speed of 19, 000 r/min can be achieved while complying with the minimum factor of safety (FOS) of 2. Each component was manufactured to the prescribed dimensional tolerances and the IM rotor section was assembled. With the failure of the first assembly process, machine experts were consulted and a revised process was implemented. The revised process entailed manufacturing five small lamination stacks and assembling the stack and squirrel cage afterwards. The end ring/conductive bar connection utilises interference fits due to the fact that the materials could not be welded. The process was successful and the IM rotor section was <b>shrink</b> <b>fitted</b> onto the shaft. However, after final machining of the rotor’s outer diameter (OD), inspections revealed axial displacement of the end rings and a revised FEA was implemented to simulate the effect. The results indicated a minimum FOS 0. 6 at very small sections and with further analytical investigation it was shown that the minimum FOS was reduced to only 1. 34. Although the calculations indicated the FOS was below the minimum prescribed FOS ? 2, the rotor spin tests were scheduled to continue as planned. The main reasons being that the lowest FOS is at very small areas and is located at non critical structural positions. The fact that the rotor speed was incrementally increased and multiple parameters were monitored, which could detect early signs of failure, further supported the decision. In testing the rotor was successfully spun up to 19, 000 r/min and 27 rotor delevitation test were conducted at speeds of up to 10, 000 r/min. After continuous testing a secondary rotor inspection was conducted and no visible changes could be detected. The lessons learnt leads to mechanical design and manufacturing recommendations and the research required to realise a 27, 000 r/min rotor design. Master...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} {{bearings}} {{for the control}} system of a fast reactor concept is presented. The bearings are required to operate at temperatures up to 2200 F {{in one of two}} fluids, lithium or argon. Basic bearing types are the same regardless of the fluid. Crowned cylindrical journals were selected for radially loaded bearings and modified spherical bearings were selected for bearings under combined thrust and radial loads. Graphite and aluminum oxide are the materials selected for the argon atmosphere bearings while cermet compositions (carbides or nitrides bonded with refractory metals) were selected for the lithium lubricated bearings.

50|$|Cylinder walls {{can become}} very worn or damaged from use. If {{the engine is}} not {{equipped}} with replaceable sleeves {{there is a limit}} to how far the cylinder walls can be bored or worn before the block must be sleeved or replaced. In such cases where the use of a sleeve or liner can restore proper clearances to an engine. Sleeves are made out of iron alloys and are very reliable. A sleeve is installed by a machinist at a machine shop. The engine block is mounted on a precision boring machine where the cylinder is then bored to a size much larger than normal and a new cast-iron sleeve can be inserted with an interference fit. The sleeves can be pressed into place, or they can be held in by a <b>shrink</b> <b>fit.</b> This is done by boring the cylinder (between 3 and 6 thousandths of an inch) smaller than the sleeve being installed, then heating the engine block and while hot, the cold sleeve can be inserted easily. When the engine block cools down it <b>shrink</b> <b>fits</b> around the sleeve holding it into place. Cylinder wall thickness is important to efficient thermal conductivity in the engine. When choosing sleeves, engines have specifications to how thick the cylinder walls should be to prevent overworking the coolant system. Each engine's needs are different, dependent on designed work load duty cycle and energy produced. After selecting and installing the sleeve, the cylinder needs to be finish bored and honed to match the piston. Care needs to be given to the finish of the cylinder walls to prevent improper ring seating at break in.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{develop an}} {{effective}} approach for the numerical solution of transient thermo-contact problems and present a typical example of its utilization regarding devices {{working on the}} principle of thermoelasticity produced by induction heating and specific technological processes intended for assembly and disassembly of systems containing <b>shrink</b> <b>fits.</b> Methodology. A finite element technique for solution of 2 D multiphysics (electromagnetic, thermal and structural) problems is developed, taking into account temperature dependences of material properties and continuous variations of the contact surfaces. Modeling of the contact interaction between two parts is based on the concept of a special contact finite element having no thickness. The functional for the temperature problem is supplemented with components corresponding to the thermal conductivity of this contact layer. The heat generated due to mutual sliding of both parts can also be taken into account, but the heat capacity (specific heat) of the contact layer is neglected. Using a special 1 D 4 -node finite elements a system of equations for the description of the thermo-contact problem is obtained. Originality. Relatively simple analytical formulae for calculation of the contact thermal resistances occurring in specific parts of electrical machines are known. The paper offers an alternative approach for the numerical solution of transient thermo-contact problems based on the concept of a special 1 D contact finite element having no thickness. Results. The presented technique is applied for the computer simulation of assembly and disassembly of a <b>shrink</b> <b>fit</b> using induction heating.
