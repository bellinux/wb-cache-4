50|$|A {{fundamentally}} {{different type of}} automatic transmission is the continuously variable transmission, or CVT, which can smoothly and <b>steplessly</b> alter its gear ratio by varying the diameter {{of a pair of}} belt or chain-linked pulleys, wheels or cones. Some continuously variable transmissions use a hydrostatic drive — consisting of a variable displacement pump and a hydraulic motor — to transmit power without gears. Some early forms, such as the Hall system (which dates back to 1896), used a fixed displacement pump and a variable displacement motor, and were designed to provide robust variable transmission for early commercial heavy motor vehicles. CVT designs are usually as fuel efficient as manual transmissions in city driving, but early designs lose efficiency as engine speed increases.|$|E
5000|$|The Snow Trac {{is made up}} {{largely of}} off the shelf {{automotive}} and industrial parts supplied by Volkswagen including an air cooled flat 4 industrial version of VW Beetle engine, a VW Bus transmission, and hundreds of surplus parts including steering wheels, shift knobs, and lighting components. A proprietary drive variator was adapted to the transmission to allow {{the use of a}} steering wheel to control the tracks. The variator <b>steplessly</b> changes the speed of the left and right tracks, accelerating one track while slowing the other to effect a turn. Unlike traditional tracked vehicle steering, the brakes are not used to turn, increasing efficiency and reducing brake wear. Production of the air cooled VW engine ceased in 1981 in Europe and this effectively led to the demise of the Snow Trac, which ended factory production in Sweden.|$|E
50|$|During Starting, the proven DIWA {{power split}} {{principle}} comes into action. As {{soon as the}} vehicle begins to move, power is divided <b>steplessly</b> between the hydrodynamic and the mechanical transmission of torque. In 1st gear, the DIWA range, input clutch and turbine brake are closed. The engine torque is directly transmitted to the outer rim of the differential. The impeller and the pump shaft is driven in opposite rotary directions via the planetary gears of the differential. During this process, the output and hence the planetary carrier remain stationary.In the converter, oil delivered by the impeller flows through the guide wheel to the turbine wheel in a closed circuit. The torque that is delivered and converted, that is increased, is transmitted to the planetary carrier via the sun gear of the turbine gear. The planetary gear shaft transmits both the torque of the input differential, that is the purely mechanical share, and the torque of the turbine gear, that is the hydrodynamic share, directly to the transmission output.|$|E

BIX, a name which consists of the words [...] "Big" [...] and [...] "pixels" [...] is the acrylic glass skin of {{the eastern side of the}} building toward the Mur and city center and represents an oversize urban screen, which serves as an instrument for artistic productions. BIX projects accompany different exhibitions and are not transported into the public area, also the direct environment is defined and shaped.

Each light ring functions as a pixel, which can be served by a central computer. In this way they can be developed as roughly screened indications, texts and film sequences, which radiate far into the urban area and thus, the blue blister of Graz with a screen of immense size makes an art gallery.|$|E

The turbulence will cause the wavefront distortion in the receiver telescope front. For direct detection laser communication system, atmospheric turbulence can affect the coupling efficiency from space laser to the detector. For coherent detection laser communication system, Atmosphere turbulence not only affects the coupling efficiency, but also can seriously reduce the heterodyne detection efficiency. Coherent detection communication receiver must use small aperture telescopes or large aperture telescope with adaptive wavefront compensation system.

40|$|Metal-organic {{frameworks}} offer tremendous {{potential for}} efficient separation of molecular mixtures. Different pore sizes and suitable functionalizations of the framework allow for an adjustment of the static selectivity. Here we report membranes which offer dynamic {{control of the}} selectivity by remote signals, thus enabling a continuous adjustment of the permeate flux. This is realized by assembling linkers containing photoresponsive azobenzene-side-groups into monolithic, crystalline membranes of metal-organic frameworks. The azobenzene moieties can be switched from the trans to the cis configuration and vice versa by irradiation with ultraviolet or visible light, resulting in a substantial modification of the membrane permeability and separation factor. The precise control of the cis:trans azobenzene ratio, for example, by controlled irradiation times or by simultaneous irradiation with ultraviolet and visible light, enables the continuous tuning of the separation. For hydrogen:carbon-dioxide, the separation factor of this smart membrane can be <b>steplessly</b> adjusted between 3 and 8...|$|E

The multi-source data includes the flow-field, water level, sea temperature, wave, wind-field and some other prediction factors. Around the visualization, some creative work has been done in this paper. Firstly, for the large amount and high density dynamic field data such as the flow field, wave direction, the wind-field, etc. In this paper, a uniform discretization algorithm is designed according to the elements of its characters. On one hand, it controls the display range of the factors. On the other hand, it controls the scale calibration. This algorithm is to make the power-field data to zoom <b>steplessly.</b> Secondly, as the storm surge data are almost long-time series data, this paper form the perspective of different design with two different solutions in order to better reflect the variation of storm surge with time, and the dynamic visualization of the prediction factors within a certain time sequence are realized...|$|E

Percentage improvement in average surface roughness PIRa and maximum surface roughness PIRtm, three-dimensional plots of the finished surface texture, and microhardness have been used as the measures of ECH process performance. The effects of finishing time, electrolyte temperature, and elec-trolyte composition have been studied through pilot experiments by varying one variable at a time, while the effects of voltage, rotating speed of the workpiece gear, and electrolyte con-centration have been studied during the main experiments designed using the Box–Behnken response surface methodology approach. Scanning electron microscopy and optical profilom-etry before and after ECH have been used to highlight the improvement in surface quality of helical gears.

40|$|This {{experimental}} study investigates {{the influence of}} different parameters on the operational behavior of high-speed hydrodynamic radial plain journal bearings such as predominantly used in turbo gearboxes. The investigations were conducted on bearings of various sizes and designs, including circular cylinder bearings, double wedge bearings, four-face bearings and tilting pad bearings with five pads. Experimental bearings with a diameter of 40 to 60 mm and a maximum bearing width of 80 mm can be installed in the bearing test rig. The motor is connected to a single-stage turbo spur gear so that the gearbox output shaft reaches a maximum rotational speed of 48, 600 min"-" 1. The experimental bearings can be <b>steplessly</b> loaded between 0 and 4 N/mm" 2. The operational behavior of the bearings is assessed by means of their friction energy, shaft displacement, oil flow rate, and bearing temperatures. The influence of bearing loading, load direction, oil feed temperature, and oil feed pressure on the operational behavior was investigated for every bearing type. The investigations were focused on the tilting pad bearings in a flooded mode of operation. Test results indicate that turbulent flow leads {{to an increase in}} the friction energy and load capacity of the bearing as compared to laminar flow. (orig.)

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the possibility of harvesting raspberries with a pulsating air stream that causes the shoots of plants to vibrate. Two tractor-driven test devices were developed under this specific objective. The first one was a high capacity compressor, and the stream of air produced by it was directed onto one side of a row of plants. The second one was a device producing two counter-flowing air streams colliding in the middle of a row of plants. The frequency of the air pulses was adjusted <b>steplessly</b> by varying the rotational velocity of the shutters closing and opening the outlets of the fans. In the field trials with the device based on a compressor-generated air stream, two air pulse frequencies were used: 500 and 540 pulses per minute (8. 3 and 9 Hz). The mean detachment force was 0. 727 N. About 50 % of ripe raspberries were removed from the bushes. The results achieved during harvesting with the device operating on the principle of colliding two pulsating air streams were markedly better and put the harvesting effectiveness within the range achieved in the trials with combine harvesters with mechanical finger shakers conducted by other researchers. For two pulse frequencies (8 and 9 Hz), almost 62 % of fruits were harvested. Increasing the pulse frequency of the counter-flowing air streams above 9 Hz did not improve the effectiveness of detaching raspberry fruits from shoots...|$|E
40|$|Additive Manufacturing (AM), or colloquially “ 3 D Printing”, {{has been}} {{referred}} to as a technology that has the potential to pave the path towards a new industrial revolution. Although scholars have comprehensively investigated technological aspects of AM, economic discussions remain scarce. Trying to substantiate the current media hype surrounding AM with analytical and empirical findings, the goal of this research project is to discuss economic implications of AM technology. This is why in Part A, a comprehensive introduction to the research field is given. The introduction includes an overview of AM technology and its industry as a whole. Moreover, theoretical background is presented which forms the basis of the three research papers in Part B of this thesis. Each of the research papers portrays distinct aspects of AM from different perspectives - in the following a brief outline of the research papers is given. In Research Paper I, a comprehensive literature review is conducted to identify the technology’s key characteristics and its implications on manufacturing firms and markets. With AM technology a direct digital manufacturing of parts is enabled. There are no penalties in manufacturing for product customization, higher variety or complexity of product designs, while assembly efforts can be reduced when functional products are produced in one step. Given these characteristics, existing models of a manufacturing firm’s payoff function and market structure are studied by adjusting underlying assumptions to reflect AM technology’s characteristics. In doing so, seven propositions are derived that build an impetus for future research. In Research Paper II, the value creation potential of product customization with AM technology is portrayed in two empirical consumer studies with a total of 426 participants. Consumers were asked about their perceived product value and willingness to pay (WTP) for products that allowed different degrees of customization: (i) a standard product without customizability, (ii) a product configuration with modular choices in product attributes (representing a conventional mass customization (MC) approach), and (iii) a continuous adjustment of product attributes (“full customization” enabled by AM). In Study 1, we assessed the value increment of enhancing customization with German consumers in a simulated online buying process of a customizable espresso cup. We revealed that there was a value upside of + 189 % for full customization compared to the standard product offering, and a + 50 % higher WTP compared to the modularly customizable product. In Study 2, we revealed a + 68 % value increment for the full customization approach compared to the conventional MC offering. Further, we identify different value drivers and discuss theoretical and managerial implications. In Research Paper III, two further consumer studies are presented with a total of 400 survey participants. They were shown simulated online buying processes of customizable kitchen knives. Again, a potential value increment when product attributes can be <b>steplessly</b> adjusted was evaluated and compared to conventional MC offerings. In Study 1, we assessed the value of customizing style-related/aesthetic product design attributes; then we evaluated customization of fit-related attributes in Study 2. When consumers could customize aesthetic attributes, we found that differences in perceived product value were insignificant. Contrarily, when consumers customized fit-related attributes, there was a significant value upside for the full customization approach enabled by AM technology. We revealed that both, product involvement and attitude toward customization influenced WTP positively. Further, we deduct theoretical and managerial implications when enhancing customization with AM and outline directions for future research. Overall, this research project highlights AM’s potential of (1) Disrupting cost paradigms of conventional manufacturing systems, (2) Changing market structures and increasing available product variety, (3) Creating a value increment when offering highly customized products, (4) Enhancing MC offerings from a modular choice to continuous adjustments in a product’s solution space, and (5) Facilitating an enhanced market segmentation strategy. In three research papers, arguments leading to these highlights are discussed while downsides of AM technology are presented, too. Different factors may hinder that these potentials can be fully unleashed such as e. g., high marginal production costs, reliability in meeting quality requirements and reproducibility of parts, availability of printable materials, or the lack of appropriate intellectual property rights (IP) and product design skills to fully exploit AM’s technological opportunities...|$|E
