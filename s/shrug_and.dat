500|$|Hungry, Jamie {{tries to}} {{surrender}} to some Japanese soldiers, who <b>shrug</b> <b>and</b> laugh him off. After being chased by a street urchin, he is taken in by Basie—an American expatriate and hustler—and his partner Frank, who nicknames him [...] "Jim". They intend to leave {{the boy in the}} streets when they are unable to sell his teeth for cash, but Jamie promises to lead them back to his neighborhood where there are valuables to loot. There, Jamie finds his house lit and sees a figure in the window whom he thinks is his mother. He runs to the door only to discover the house is occupied by Japanese troops, who take the trio prisoner. They are then taken to Lunghua Civilian Assembly Center in Shanghai for processing. A truck later arrives to take selected internees to the Suzhou Creek Internment Camp; Basie is among those selected to go but Jamie is not. Because he knows of the camp's location, a desperate Jamie convinces the soldiers to take him.|$|E
2500|$|At −10° Celsius, heating is {{switched}} on in British homes, while Finns change into a long-sleeved shirt. At −20°, Austrians fly to Málaga, while Finns celebrate midsummer.

2500|$|When {{asked to}} {{identify}} photographs of his victims, Haarmann became taciturn and dismissive as he typically claimed to be unable to recognize any of his victims' photographs; however, in instances where he claimed to be unable to recognize his victims' faces but the victims' clothing {{had been found in}} his possession, he would simply <b>shrug</b> <b>and</b> make comments to the effect of, [...] "I probably killed him." [...] For example, when {{asked to identify}} a photograph of victim Alfred Hogrefe, Haarmann stated: [...] "I certainly assume I killed Hogrefe, but I don't remember his face." ...|$|E

2500|$|Using the Tralfamadorian {{passivity}} of fate, Billy Pilgrim {{learns to}} overlook {{death and the}} shock involved with death. Pilgrim claims the Tralfamadorian philosophy on death to be his most important lesson:The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die. He {{is still very much}} alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will exist. [...] When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition in that particular moment, but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other moments. Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply <b>shrug</b> <b>and</b> say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is [...] "So it goes."Billy Pilgrim continues throughout the novel to use the term [...] "so it goes" [...] as it relates to death. The ideas behind death, fate, time, and free will are drastically different when compared to those of Christianity.|$|E
