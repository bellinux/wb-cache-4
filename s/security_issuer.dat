5000|$|Book {{entry is}} a system of {{tracking}} ownership of securities where no certificate is given to investors. [...] Several terms are often used interchangeably with [...] "book entry" [...] shares including [...] "paperless shares", [...] "electronic shares", [...] "digital shares", [...] "digital stock certificates", and [...] "uncertificated shares". Some of these terms have somewhat different connotations but, {{at least in the}} United States, state securities laws only recognize certificated and uncertificated shares. [...] In the case of book-entry-only (BEO) issues, while investors do not receive certificates, a custodian holds one or more global certificates. [...] Dematerialized securities, in contrast, are ones in which no certificates exist; instead, the <b>security</b> <b>issuer,</b> its agent or a central securities depository keeps records, usually electronically of who holds outstanding securities.|$|E

While call provisions have historically been the default option in convertible security design, {{only a minority of}} post- 2005 issues are callable. Because hedge funds dominate the market for new convertibles today and because convertible arbitrage is less risky without callability, the recent diminution in the frequency of call provisions in new convertible bond issues illustrates the importance of the preferences of the suppliers of capital in security design...|$|E

40|$|We {{study how}} {{securities}} and issuance mechanisms {{can be designed}} to mitigate the adverse impact of market imperfections on liquidity. In our model, asset owners seek to obtain liquidity by selling claims contingent on privately observed future cash-flows. Liquidity suppliers can be competitive or strategic. In the optimal trading mechanism associated to an arbitrary given <b>security,</b> <b>issuers</b> with low cash-flows sell their entire holdings of the <b>security,</b> while <b>issuers</b> with high cash-flows are typically excluded from trade. By designing the <b>security</b> optimally, <b>issuers</b> can avoid exclusion altogether. We show that the optimal security is debt. Because of its low informational sensitivity, debt mitigates the adverse selection problem.
