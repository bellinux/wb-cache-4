50|$|Different from cars, planes or trains, {{motorcycle}} {{rear and}} front wheels are controlled separately. If the rider only brakes with one wheel, this braked wheel tends {{to lock up}} faster than if both brakes had been applied. A <b>Combined</b> <b>Braking</b> System therefore distributes the brake force also to the non-braked wheel to lower {{the possibility of a}} lock up, increase deceleration and reduce suspension pitch.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>combined</b> <b>braking</b> system (CBS), {{also called}} linked braking system (LBS), {{is a system}} for linking front and rear brakes on a {{motorcycle}} or scooter. [...] In this system, the rider's action of depressing one of the brake levers applies both front and rear brakes. The amount of each brake applied may be determined by a proportional control valve.This is distinct from integrated brakes, where applying pressure to brake pedal only includes application of some front brake.|$|R

50|$|In the 1930s the {{automatic}} coupler project saw the underframes replaced. The new design was all-steel, reinforced with centre sills {{in lieu of}} the truss rods and heavier bracing on the ends, and the brake equipment on the first 201 wagons was upgraded from the previous <b>combined</b> <b>brake</b> cylinder and auxiliary reservoir to a larger brake cylinder and a separate auxiliary reservoir. When the buffers and truss rods were removed in the 1950s, the wagon capacity was boosted a further ton.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the vehicle}} is {{rotating}} sufficiently rapidly, its angular momentum of rotation can overcome the stabilizing influence of the tires (either braking or skidding), and the rotation will continue even if the wheels are centered or past the point that {{the vehicle is}} controlled. This can be caused by some tires locking up in braking while others continue to rotate, or under acceleration where driven tires may lose traction (especially, if they lose traction unevenly), or in <b>combining</b> <b>braking</b> or acceleration with turning.|$|R

Larger-capacity panniers (left capacity increased from 18 to 24 litres; right capacity increased from 16.7 to 19.5 litres) with more secure cover latches and hinges were fitted.

50|$|BMW Motorrad uses {{a system}} called Integral ABS, {{in which the}} front brake lever {{operates}} both {{the front and rear}} brakes, while the brake pedal operates only the rear brake. In the inverse, Honda's system that features both <b>combined</b> <b>brakes</b> and anti-lock <b>brakes</b> is dubbed <b>Combined</b> ABS. In this system, the rear brake pedal operates both front and rear brake, and the front brake lever operates the front calipers, which in turn activates a secondary master cylinder to engage the rear brake. ABS modulators are installed on both the front and rear wheel.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: For {{the safety}} problem of heavy duty {{vehicles}} running on long downhill sections, a model {{was built for}} the application of engine brake and service brake combination based on test results. And a model of brake temperature rise for heavy duty vehicles running on long downhill sections was also established. For different braking modes, gear positions, speed and downhill slopes, brake temperature rising to 250 ℃ was used as the index. And then simulation of brake temperature rise and downhill distance was researched. Simulation results show that the <b>combined</b> <b>braking</b> of low gear and high speed should be adopted for heavy duty vehicles running on long downhill sections...|$|R
40|$|Time and the {{stopping}} {{distance of the}} electric drive with frequent starting-and-braking modes that contain embedded asynchronous motor with a recessed <b>combined</b> <b>braking</b> device depend on the moment of an electromagnet disinhibition. At the same time other important criteria are taken into the account, i. e. wear resistance of the brake device and the smoothness of the deceleration of the electric drive. In general such an asynchronous motor contains asynchronous engine with squirrel-cage rotor, electromechanical normally-closed brake, electromagnetical slip clutch and control circuit. The mechanical characteristics of the deceleration of asynchronous motor with recessed <b>combined</b> <b>brake</b> device at different moments of an electromagnet disinhibition are presented.  The mathematical model is featured and the transients in such a motor are presented.  Formation models for computer research were {{carried out in the}} Fortran 2008 programming language. Calculation of the system of differential equations was fulfilled by the Runge – Kutta method. The deceleration of the electromechanical brake at various speeds caused different time values and {{stopping distance}}s. The plots of stopping distance and the braking time at various moments of an electromagnet disinhibition are demonstrated.  The optimum moment of switching on an electromechanical brake, providing small stopping distance and the braking time is the time when the speed wвкл = 0, 6 – 0, 8 of the nominal. In this case the acceptable number of brake applications for friction linings (compared with mechanical braking) will increase by 1. 6 – 2. 8 times. The pilot study confirmed the validity of the obtained mathematical models and discovered patterns. </p...|$|R

50|$|The VFR1200F {{incorporates}} the C-ABS <b>combined</b> <b>braking</b> system sourced from the CBR600RR and CBR1000RR sport bikes. C-ABS distributes the braking forces completely electronically sending {{information from the}} brake lever into a separate braking computer before the system applies hydraulic pressure to the brakes. Anti-lock brakes (ABS) now as standard equipment rather than optional equipment {{as they were in}} the previous generation. During front brake lever activation, all the right-side caliper pistons are applied, along with four of the pistons on the left side. When the rear brake is applied, the other two left-side pistons are actuated. To maintain equal braking force when using just the front brake, the right-side pistons are slightly smaller than the left-side pistons.|$|R

Honda's first <b>combined</b> <b>braking</b> system, dubbed Unified Braking at the time, debuted in 1983; it engaged both front and rear brakes in unison when the brake pedal was applied.
