For big farms operations, minimizing energy consumption, decreasing the time losses and increasing work efficiency, a heavy duty tractor of ITM 8200 series was started to design in the same Company. The gearbox selection, design and analysis for this tractor with the engine power of 154 horse power is studied in this research. The mechanical gearbox equipped with mechanical-hydraulic dynashift system was used in ITM 8200 power transmission system. The dynashift system produces four cases (A, B, C and D) with 8 speeds that produced by main gearbox, which altogether produces 32 forward speeds and 32 reverse speeds for this new tractor. To design the gearbox, with recommended speeds, gearbox ratios and gears ratios was calculated.

40|$|This study aims {{to acquire}} a better {{understanding}} of the dynamic response of a dry friction (<b>slip</b> <b>torque</b> converter) clutch that is widely found in automatic transmissions. A drivetrain system is simplified as a two-degree of freedom torsional system for the sake of illustration. Friction clutch is treated as a power transmission path that is subjected to time-varying normal load. Under a sinusoidal torque excitation, three types of friction interface motions, namely pure stick, pure slip and stick-slip motions are determined via analytical or computational approaches. Transient time histories are of interest. It is observed that a well-tuned normal load could possibly attenuate the stick-slip transients even in the presence of the negative slope in friction-velocity characteristics. Plausible physical explanations are provided. ...|$|E

The test was performed on a concave skid trail, where tractor loaded with 8 meter long fir logs stopped at the 32 % incline. It stopped somewhat later when skidding with butt-end forward in comparison to skidding with top-end forward. The loadweight with butt-end forward was 31. 69 kN, whereas with top-end forward itweighed 33. 53 kN. The measured speeds showed minute changes until the last meter, but decreased swiftly after stopping. Regarding some technical parameters, there were almost no changes at the end of stopping, two exceptions being the slip, which increased in the range of stopping, and the forward torque, which decreased in this range. The results showed that the hydrostatic transmission was efficient, considering that in a relatively well-controlled slip (the slip values increase only in the last three meters, which approximately equals the half of tractor's length) there was less grounddamage...|$|E
40|$|The impact an {{aircraft}} has on its tires when it lands has been problematic practically since {{the invention of}} the airplane. Upon touchdown, the tires frequently smoke as rubber burns off and tire material is worn away while the tires slip up to a steady rolling speed. To minimise tire <b>slip,</b> <b>torque</b> or spin mechanisms could be added to each tire assembly to accelerate the tire to match the landing speed. Patents have been registered since the 1940 s to improve tire safety and performance, decrease the substantial wear that results from every landing, and save airline companies the cost of regularly replacing expensive worn tires and to clean tarmacs. In this paper, a case study is presented of a Boeing 747 - 400 aircraft touching down on a runway and its wheels spinning up to match the forward speed of the aircraft as it rolls along the runway. A LuGre friction model is employed to simulate the dynamic behaviour of the tires during a typical landing, and Archard wear theory is used to compare tire wearing between initially static and pre-spun wheels. We conclude that the amount of rubber worn from the tire on each landing is proportional to the kinetic energy that the wheel must gain to reach a free-rolling velocity. Therefore tire wear is proportional to the square of the initial difference between wheel speed and horizontal aircraft velocity...|$|E

After {{completion}} of the operational checks, the load bar was being reinstalled on the cargo pallet when the motor control FORWARD relay failed in the energized position. The pallet was pinned at all locations (each pin has a load capacity of 16, 000 lbs.) while the winch was running. The wire rope snapped before aircraft power could be removed. After disassembly, the fractured wire rope was shipped to ES 4 lab for further characterization of the wire rope portion of the failure. The system was being operated without {{a clear understanding of}} the system capability and function. The proximate cause was the failure of the K 48 -Forward Winch Control Relay in the energized position, which allowed the motor to continuously run without command from the hand controller, and operation of the winch system with both controllers connected to the system. This prevented the emergency stop feature on the hand controller from functioning as designed. An electrical checkout engineering work instruction was completed and identified the failed relay and confirmed the emergency stop only paused the system when the STOP button on both connected hand controllers were depressed simultaneously. The winch system incorporates a torque limiting clutch. It is suspected that the clutch did not slip and the motor did not stall or overload the current limiter.

These cables run through a series of guides and pull on attachment points at the fingertips and forearms, emulating muscle tension and generating joint torque. For energy dense actuation, DC electric motors were used to drive pulleys for cable actuation. To increase user comfort and safety, mechanically compliant actuation was added by using clutches with continuously variable <b>slip</b> <b>torque</b> between motor and pulley which could act as a means of mechanical force control.

40|$|In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden Ergebnisse von numerischen Untersuchungen vorgestellt, die mit topografischer Veränderung der Fugenfläche bei zylindrischen Press-verbindungen eine Spannungsoptimierung bewirken. Durch diese Spannungsoptimierung wird das Auftreten der Spannungsspitzen reduziert und die spezifische Reibenergie, die ein Maß für die Reibdauerbeanspruchung ist, an der Nabenkante deutlich verringert. Ziel dieses Forschungsschwerpunktes war der Aufbau einer ganzheitlichen Untersuchungsmethodik von Welle-Nabe-Verbindungen unter Torsionsbelastung, die den direkten Vergleich von numerischen und experimentellen Ergebnissen ermöglicht. Für die experimentellen dynamischen Versuche wurde ein neuartiges Prüfstandskonzept mit dazugehöriger Probenform entwickelt, das ein gleichzeitiges Belasten zweier stehender Welle-Nabe-Verbindungen ermöglicht. Bei diesem Prüfstandskonzept können alle denkbaren Belastungsfälle für Torsion untersucht werden. Zusätzlich ist eine gleichzeitige Überlagerung einer umlaufenden Biegung möglich. Für weitere experimentelle Untersuchungen wurde eine Vorrichtung aufgebaut, mit deren Hilfe der integrale Reibwert in Umfangsrichtung ermittelt werden kann. Ein neuartiges Konzept zur Messung der Relativbewegung an der Nabenkante wurde entwickelt, um die veränderte Reibcharakteristik vor und nach der dynamischen Belastung an der Nabenkante nachzuweisen. Die numerischen Ergebnisse der spannungsoptimierten Pressverbindungen zeigen, dass eine Zunahme des Schlupfes an der Nabenkante stattfindet und die verringerte Pressung an dieser Stelle zu einer deutlichen Reduzierung der spezifischen Reibenergie bei allen untersuchten Pressverbindungen führt. Das Ergebnis bei der Ausführung einer glatter Welle ist die Reduzierung der spezifischen Reibenergie um einen Faktor von über zwei und bei abgesetzter Welle von über vier. Spezielle Übergänge zwischen den Wellenabsätzen an der Nabenkante wurden mit verschiedenen Freistichformen untersucht und auch dabei wurde eine deutliche Verringerung der Reibenergie festgestellt. Für die analytische Berechnung des Schlupfes für spannungshomogenisierte Pressverbindungen wurden, aufbauend auf den analytischen Formeln nach Leidich /LEIDICH 83 /, Korrekturkurven ermittelt, mit denen der Schlupf berechnet werden kann. Weiterhin werden Korrekturkurven angegeben, für die der Schlupf in Abhängigkeit von der Geometrie der Wellenschulter analytisch berechnet werden kann. Zur Anpassung des optimalen Übermaßverlaufes wurde eine Annäherung mittels einer Radien-Fasen-Korrektur vorgenommen. Es zeigt sich, dass zur Reduzierung der spezifischen Reibenergie das Übermaßniveau direkt an der Nabenkante {{relevant}} ist und der darauffolgende Verlauf des Übermaßes nur von untergeordneter Bedeutung ist. Somit ist eine Reduzierung der Reibdauerbeanspruchung mittels eines an das spannungshomogenisierte Übermaß an der Nabenkante angenäherten Fasenniveaus realisierbar. Erstmalig wurde numerisch der lokale Reibwert an den schlupfbehafteten Gleitzonen innerhalb der Fugenfläche schrittweise erhöht, um die Veränderung der realen Reibverhältnisse abzubilden. Vergleichend mit den integral eingesetzten Reibwerten bewirkt die Anpassung des lokalen Reibwertes eine Schlupfzunahme von maximal 1 µm. Mit der experimentellen Schlupfmessung konnte infolge des direkten Vergleichs vor und nach der dynamischen Belastung eine deutliche Reduzierung der Schlupfamplituden ermittelt werden. Mithilfe analytischer Gleichungen gelingt es, den dafür angepassten lokalen Reibwert für die konventionellen und die spannungsoptimierten Pressverbindung zu errechnen. Die jungfräulich lokalen Reibwerte von 0, 3 bis 0, 4 stiegen während der Belastung bei gemessenen Rautiefen von Rz = 5 µm auf ein Niveau bis 0, 7 an. Diese Reibwerterhöhung wird für geschliffene Proben wahrscheinlich noch höher ausfallen und somit auch direkte Reibverschweißungen an der Nabenkante mit sich bringen. This work {{presents the}} results of experimental and numerical investigations, showing how changes in the topography of the contact surface of cylindrical pressed shaft-hub connections lead to stress optimization effects which considerably reduce the occurrence of stress peaks and fretting fatigue at the hub edge. This homogenization of stress is realized by a variable interference along the axial length of the connection. The key objective of the research at hand was to establish a holistic methodology for the examination of shaft-hub connections subjected to torsional load which would enable direct comparison of numerical and experimental results. Within the framework of the research, an innovative test bench concept with standing still specimen allowing two standing shaft-hub connections to be tested simultaneously was developed for dynamic experimentation. Extremely flexible in deployment, the new test bench is suitable for performance {{of a wide variety of}} torsion tests. In addition, a circumferential bend may be superimposed in parallel. For further experimental investigations, a device was developed for usage in calculating the integral friction value in circumferential direction. An advanced approach for measurement of the relative movement at the hub edge was introduced to quantify the change in friction characteristic at the hub edge before and after application of dynamic stresses. Numerical results of stress-optimized pressed connections evidence an increase in slip at the hub edge with the subsequent reduction in pressure at this location leading to a significant drop in specific friction energy for all the pressed connections examined. Results for smooth shafts showed that the specific friction energy was reduced to under half the original value, while for shafts with shoulder fillets the figure decreased to even lower than one-fourth. When special transitions between the chamfers of the shafts at the hub edge were investigated using various groove shapes, these also showed a clear reduction in friction energy. To analytically compute the slip for stress-strain homogenized pressed connections, an analytical formula proposed by Leidich /LEIDICH 83 / has been used to calculate correction curves for the pressed connections investigated, multiplying them to derive the slip. Furthermore, this work presents correction curves which have been found suitable for the analytical calculation of slip as a function of the shaft shoulder. To adapt the optimal press fit, an approximation using radius-chamfer correction was carried out. Results showed that the press fit interference at the hub edge is the crucial factor for a reduction in the specific friction energy with the further interference playing only a subordinate role. Hence, it follows that a reduction in fretting fatigue may be achieved by correct design of the chamfer height at the hub edge. For the first time ever, the local friction value at the slip zones within the contact surface was increased in increments to represent changes in the real friction conditions. Com-pared to the integral friction values, this adjustment of the local friction value resulted in an increase in slip of no more than 1 µm. Employing direct benchmarking techniques before and after dynamic stress testing, the experimental slip measurement approach determined a sharp reduction in slip amplitudes. Then using analytic equations, the adapted local friction value can be calculated for both the conventional and stress-optimized pressed connections. Before applying the load, the friction values ranged between 0. 3 and 0. 4 with a measured roughness depth of RZ = 5 µm. The friction values rose up to 0. 7 while the load was applied and remained constant. This increase in the friction value is significantly greater for smooth specimens, thus resulting in direct friction fusing at the hub edge. Since a pressed connection is designed in a range under the <b>slip</b> <b>torque</b> threshold, these results imply that a much higher friction value can be assumed for the design than recommended in the relevant industrial norms DIN 7190 /DIN 7190 - 01 / due to the fact that when dynamic stresses are applied a stationary status comes into being within the friction characteristic. Consequently, the stick-slip thresholds would also seem to be set too high for the specimens tested as these parameters were calculated on the basis of too low (local) friction values. There is therefore no evidence to conclude that, even for slip less than 0. 5 µm, a pressed connection will be fatigue resistant. And this would seem to be underpinned by examinations of worn pressed connections where damage occurred after a number of years. This work arrives at the conclusion that assured design is only possible in pressed connections which do not evidence relative movement between the shaft and the hub...|$|E

Tooth root strain is measured by a linear pattern of strain gauges, either wired in a quarter-bridge configuration or with di-rect measurement, to capture axial strain distribution. Signals from rotating sen-sors are fed out to the stationary acquisition system by means of <b>slip</b> rings. Trans-mitted <b>torque</b> is measured using a rotating torque flange with contactless signal transmission to its stator. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{computer}} program WHEEL is {{a mathematical model}} which predicts off-road vehicle performance characteristics. The program was developed using empirical relationships resulting from mobility tests on conventional-sized trucks and tires. The model was subsequently validated by comparing the model's predicted values of vehicle performance parameters, such as net drawbar pull, <b>slip,</b> sinkage and <b>torque,</b> with field test results for conventional-sized vehicles. However, validity of the model for predicting the off-road mobility of vehicles with large diameter tires was not established. The {{purpose of this study}} was to provide this validation. Values of net drawbar pull and slip for a Case 2390 tractor with 70. 2 " diameter driven wheels predicted by {{computer program}} WHEEL compare favorably with traction data obtained from tractor performance tests conducted by the University of Arizona Department of Agricultural Engineering. Therefore, the model may be used confidently to analyze performance of vehicles with large diameter wheels...|$|R
50|$|The torque {{applied to}} each driving wheel {{is the result}} of the engine, transmission, and drive axle {{applying}} a twisting force against the resistance of the traction at that roadwheel. In lower gears, and thus at lower speeds, and unless the load is exceptionally high, the drivetrain can supply as much torque as necessary, so the limiting factor becomes the traction under each wheel. It is therefore convenient to define traction as the amount of force that can be transmitted between the tire and the road surface before the wheel starts to <b>slip.</b> If the <b>torque</b> applied to one of the drive wheels exceeds the threshold of traction, then that wheel will spin, and thus provide torque only at the other driven wheel equal to the sliding friction at the slipping wheel. The reduced net traction may still be enough to propel the vehicle slowly.|$|R
