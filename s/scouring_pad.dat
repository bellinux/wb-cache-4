40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find the amount of bacteria that is trapped in scratches on tableware- plates/bowls/cups and other eating utensils, also to find the effect of different <b>scouring</b> <b>pads</b> on tableware. Six (6) types of kitchenware were washed with different types of scourers. The utensils were then closely examined for any damages or any scratches. Highly abrasive, light duty, moderate abrasive and spiral stainless steel ball most abrasive types of scourers were used. The most abrasive scourers, that is the stainless steel ball caused heavy scratches on most of the utensils used whereas the other scourers had very little or no effect on plates. To evaluate the bacterial load on scratched utensils, scratched plates were soiled with rice porridge mixed with Escherichia coli to mimic a contaminated plate and then the plates were washed. A batch of non scratched plates was used as control. A high bacterial load was seen on contaminated scratched plates washed with water and detergent without use of any scourers. It was observed that it is important to use appropriate type of scourers for the right type of plates to avoid any damages. Scratched or chipped plates can harbour bacteria and if not properly washed or sterilised can even cause disease...|$|R

This study measured the effectiveness of basic shop cleaning. Initially, three items representing parts of an oxygen system were contaminated: a metal plate, valve body, and metal oxygen bottle. The contaminants chosen were those most likely to be introduced to the system during normal use: oil, lubricant, metal shavings/powder, sand, fingerprints, tape, lip balm, and hand lotion. The cleaning process used hot water, soap, various brushes, gaseous nitrogen, water nozzle, plastic trays, <b>scouring</b> <b>pads,</b> and a controlled shop environment. Test subjects were classified into three groups: technical professionals having an appreciation for oxygen hazards; professional precision cleaners; and a group with no previous professional knowledge of oxygen or precision cleaning. Three test subjects were in each group, and each was provided with standard cleaning equipment, a cleaning procedure, and one of each of the three test items to clean. The results indicated that the achievable cleanliness level was independent of the technical knowledge or proficiency of the personnel cleaning the items.

A few days after it was published, he was sent a package full of large cotton swabs, industrial-strength <b>scouring</b> <b>pads,</b> and a card that read, [...] "The next time you review Miles Davis clean out your head." [...] Although Giddins dismissed the message, Agharta grew {{to become one of}} his favorite albums from the trumpeter's electric period, as he reevaluated its elements of drama, relentless tension, and what he considered the best performances of Fortune and Cosey's careers. [...] "There really is not a moment when the music fails to reflect the ministrations of the sorcerer himself", Giddins later said. Nathan Cobb from The Boston Globe reviewed the record favorably in 1976, calling it [...] "a kind of firestorm for the '70s" [...] with a [...] "positively cosmic" [...] rhythmic foundation and Davis [...] "the one who leads the others through the unknown waters of electronic jazz rock". In Down Beat, Gilmore said the band performed best on the breakneck segments opening each of the two discs, where Cosey's ferocious improvisations [...] "achieved a staggering emotional dimension" [...] lacking on the slower passages, which he felt were redeemed by Davis' elegiac trumpet playing. Lester Bangs found Agharta too difficult to definitively assess but nonetheless more fascinating than most other music being released at the time. He wrote in Phonograph Record that Davis' new music was the product of his heart's once luminous [...] "emotional capacities" [...] having been shattered by [...] "great, perhaps unbearable suffering", but that [...] "the soul beyond it" [...] could never be destroyed and interestingly [...] "almost glows uniquely brighter in its own dark coldness; and that, that which is all that is left, is merely the universe".|$|R
40|$|Hatcheries offer a {{realistic}} approach to solving {{many of the}} problems that constrain the mussel (Mytilus edulis) culture industry in the U. S. and elsewhere. But for this approach to be economically viable, growers {{need to be able to}} effectively use very small (1 mm), recently metamor-­phosed, and thus inexpensive spat. However, the ecology of these transplanted spat has received very little attention and previous attempts at using these spat have often failed. Therefore the purpose of this dissertation was to identify the major causes of mortality of recently planted spat and to analyze how management variables, such as planting season, initial density, and substratum type, affect production. As a prerequisite to this study, a method was developed to reliably metamorphose Mytilus edulis larvae in the hatchery. This was achieved by using a downwelling system which is described. In addition, the spat so produced had to be tagged so that they could be distinguished from wild spat. 	A tagging method is described based on the finding that shell pigmentation was controlled by light intensity. Field caging experiments using these tagged spat in Tomales Bay, CA showed that the seasonal pattern of inshore migration and reproduction of small surfperch, chiefly Cyrnatogaster aggregata, caused a seasonal pattern of high summertime: mortality. 	 This could be avoided by excluding the fish with netting (11 mm mesh diameter). A size refuge against these predators was reached at 11 mm. 	 The flat­ worm, Notoplana inquieta, was also found to be an important predator. It could be eradicated using a 3 minute fresh­ water dip. Mortality, fouling, and growth were found to be strong­ly density dependent. 	 The highest yield was attained by planting at low density (2 /cm 2) in the month of March when fouling was light. Large scale crops could be successfully started by remote setting of the spat in tanks of static, unaerated seawater at ambient temperature. 	In some cases, the seeded substrata could be removed from the tank after as little as 1. 5 hr. Rubberized, curled hair packing material with a backing of <b>scour</b> <b>pad</b> was a good substratum, providing a protective, easily seeded habitat for the spat...|$|R
40|$|Ashland, Oregon {{is a smart}} little {{community}} {{nestled in}} the foothills of the Siskiyou Mountains about 20 minutes north of the California border. Home to Southern Oregon University and host to the yearly Shakespeare Festival, Ashland is one of those places both progressive and picturesque that often occupies a top spot on waiting-room magazines' “Best Small Towns” or “Best Places to Retire” lists. It's got a walkable business district with cozy fine-dining bistros, new-age book shops and old-school hotels. It's got the requisite breathtaking views—Oregon's famed firs snake up and down steep, mist-laden hills to the east and west. It's got equal parts West-Coast hippie charm and urbane artiness, but it still retains the ruddy feel of the Northwest wilderness. Less well-known is the fact that Ashland is home to the Church of the Holy Light of the Queen, the unofficial base in the United States for a growing alternative religion called Santo Daime. With origins in the Brazilian Amazon, Santo Daime would attract little attention if not for one fact: worshipers drink ayahuasca, an imported jungle brew that contains dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, a highly potent hallucinogen. DMT can cause intense dissociation—the feeling that you've left your body—and everything from excruciating horror to intense euphoria. It's often associated with the near-death experience; some scientists postulate that the human brain contains otherwise dormant amounts of the psychedelic compound, and it releases that cache when your mind thinks it's done for. Ayahuasca contains DMT and is used widely by various shamans and tribes in the Amazon, where it's known as yage, hoasca, or La Purga (“the purge”). Santo Daime's followers, the Daimestas, refer to ayahuasca as Daime Tea, and they drink it as their one and only sacrament. The DMT-packed tea is the cornerstone of their religion and all church functions. DMT is also listed by the U. S. DEA as a Schedule-I substance, the department's strictest classification. Ashland’s Church of the Holy Light of the Queen was founded by Padrinho (“Godfather” in Portuguese) Jonathan Goldman, an ebullient yet laid-back former Boston acupuncturist with a working-class, midwestern Jewish upbringing and a lifelong intuition for battling the status quo. Goldman, his family and his church have been under fire from the DEA since the church formed and started hosting underground Santo Daime rituals in Ashland in 1993. Police stormed Goldman's house in a 1999 raid, and they arrested him and effectively shut down the church. He responded by filing a lawsuit against the federal government, seeking a religious freedom exemption from the Controlled Substances Act. Nine years later, Ashland's Daimestas prevailed in an Oregon district court, and they've been drinking Daime Tea with impunity since March 2009. Daime Tea is an entheogen—a substance meant purely for spiritual and psychotherapeutic purposes. The Daimestas say it's something everyone should be allowed to have. They believe it grants direct access to the divine and can lead to life-changing insights and sustained happiness. I wondered, is there any real spiritual healing going on here, or are the Daimestas just futzing around with an acute psychedelic for kicks? Just who are these people anyway, and do they believe there's a real connection between God and drugs? After learning of these strange folks, I had to take a trip to Ashland to find out the answers. *** The way Santo Daime's doctrine works is simple: the religion is open to anyone who shows interest. So one day last fall I wrote to Goldman and asked if I could come to Ashland and observe the church’s members doing whatever it is they do. It was weeks before I heard back. Goldman informed me that he would be open to a story, but under one condition: I had to attend a church service, which he called a “work. ” And not as an observer. As a participant. He instructed me to set up an interview with someone named John Seligman, a fellow Daime expert and the chief screener of new church applicants. Seligman sent me a Goldman-penned introduction to the Daime, a blank medical waiver and a note scheduling my interview for early January. I read the airy introduction, scratched my head and called Goldman for some basic background. He said the work would involve a kind of dancing that puts participants in a trance state of “active meditation. ” Add in the Daime Tea, which he called a “super-powerful, altering, natural substance,” and you've got a shortcut—a very intense, demanding shortcut—to profound spiritual vision. “What the Daime offers is a direct experience that is only reserved for mystics,” Goldman said. That sounded alright, but I wanted some objective information on the strange psychedelic brew I was about to swallow. Not surprisingly, dredging up coherent accounts about ayahuasca isn’t easy. And, as with most substances of its ilk, user experience varies wildly from person to person. Take The Yage Letters, for instance, a tortuous, fragmented tale about Burroughs' and Ginsberg's frustrating quests for the drink in South and Central America. Ginsberg wrote of a pleasant (if bizarre) first ayahuasca experience, where he peered “at a mystery” through a “big black hole of God-Nose. ” His next trip, however, was all vomiting and horrifying snake hallucinations. “I was frightened,” he complained, “and simply lay there with wave after wave of death-fear rolling over me till I could hardly stand it. ” And his final summation of ayahuasca doesn’t quite read like a ringing endorsement: “I am afraid of some real madness, a Changed Universe permanently changed. ” By the time January came around, I had decided the short version was twofold: the Daime would be very intense and demanding yet simple and beautiful. And I might puke my guts out. So I headed north through the flatlands and into the mountains on Interstate 5. The sun shone through the thickly misty sky like an incandescent silver dollar, and I wondered if I might soon be tripping with the angels, talking to God and driving back home as a mystic. *** My orientation was set for the morning of the work. It was a damp, snowy Saturday when I arrived at the church's headquarters, a nondescript, street-level office space at the end of a short commercial strip. I knocked on a door marked with a Star of David festooned with birds and circles and a glowing, double-beamed cross in the center. Seligman appeared and beckoned me in, instructing me to take off my shoes. He looked a little disheveled, sporting ragged, paint-splattered pants and a day or two of stubble on his face, with eyebrows like miniature <b>scouring</b> <b>pads</b> and a chunk of gray tufts protruding from either side of his head. Other than the strangeness of his eerie calm and a clear, steady look in his eye—qualities I later noticed were present in all the Daimestas I would meet—he struck me as a pretty benign guy. “Welcome, Alex,” he said. We shook hands and sat down on folding chairs at an altar shaped like a six-pointed star. A certain degree of anonymity is important to the Daimestas, so rather than engaging me in a lot of small talk, Seligman merely closed his eyes. We sat for a few minutes in silent meditation. Then, Seligman opened his heavy-lidded eyes and in a half-whispered tone declared the room we were sitting in a “sacred space. ” In a slow, considered way, Seligman began by explaining the basics. This particular work would be an important one, a celebration of Three Kings Day, which sounded familiar to me from having grown up Catholic (although all I remembered was that it had something to do with Christmas). For this work, we’d be singing the entirety of a 128 -song hymnbook in Portuguese and dancing for up to 12 hours. And every two hours, we’d be drinking another swig of Daime Tea. Once the work started, Seligman said, what I could expect and what would be expected of me would include the following: maintaining vibrational cohesiveness and harmony through music and dancing [...] . holding the current [...] . creating a bridge [...] . allowing celestial energies to come down through the altar metaphorically and actually [...] . and holding a sacred communion both private and communal with divine guides. What the hell was this man talking about? Seligman's soothing voice and nebulous syntax only amplified my anxiety. I was starting to feel pretty awkward. As his exposition on something about divine entities ground to a halt, I was thinking about weaseling out. Maybe I could fail the interview. “Having strangers come in—it doesn't distract from the energy, the current, at all?” I asked in a loud, abrupt voice. Seligman smiled calmly and watched me squirm. I wasn't getting away that easily. “There are no visitors,” he said. “Everybody's a participant. ” He explained to me that all are guaranteed a protective and nurturing environment, a container to process the unpredictable and often demanding revelations brought forth by drinking Daime Tea. The container provides the proper setting, as I imagined Timothy Leary might put it, for the revelations, which may send me on a brutal ride through latent emotional traumas and truths. “Throwing up may be part of that,” Seligman said. “What we allow—this container that we create—is to process it. There's an invitation. It's not expected of you, but if it comes up, we are holding space for you to move through that. We invite you to cry. We are there to help. ” Really? I was about to spend twelve hours in the divine container with a bunch of caterwauling strangers, feet sore, sobbing, puking, and high on DMT the whole time? “About the tea,” I said, trying to maintain a tone of composure. “What if it's not working out for me and I'm having a bad time of it after the first drink? Could I skip the next go-round?” “The answer is yes,” Seligman replied. “But the answer is also no. ” It would all be up to the divine guides. “If you feel like you're gonna die,” he assured|$|R
