5|$|Built to Brigham Young's design, the handcarts {{resembled a}} large wheelbarrow, with two wheels five feet (1.5m) in {{diameter}} and a single axle {{four and a half}} feet (1.4m) wide, and weighing 60 pounds (27kg). Running along each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> were seven-foot (2.1 m) pull shafts ending with a three-foot (0.9m) crossbar at the front. The crossbar allowed the carts to be pushed or pulled. Cargo was carried in a box about three feet by four feet (0.9m by 1.2m), with 8inch (0.2m) walls. The handcarts generally carried up to 250 pounds (110kg) of supplies and luggage, though they were capable of handling loads as heavy as 500 pounds (230kg). Carts used in the first year's migration were made entirely of wood ("Iowa hickory or oak"); in later years a stronger design was substituted, which included metal elements.|$|E
25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up against the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E
25|$|On 29 January 1889, Franz Joseph and Elisabeth gave {{a family}} dinner party prior to leaving for Buda, in Hungary, on 31 January; Rudolf excused himself, {{claiming}} to be indisposed. He had arranged for a day's shooting at Mayerling early {{on the morning of}} the 30th, but when his valet Loschek went to call him, there was no answer. Count Joseph Hoyos, the Archduke's hunting companion, joined in, with no response. They tried to force the door, but it would not give. Finally Loschek smashed in a panel with an axe to find the room shuttered and half-dark. Rudolf was found sitting (by some accounts, lying) motionless by the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> leaning forward and bleeding from the mouth. Before him on the bedside table stood a glass and a mirror. Without closer examination in the poor light, Loschek assumed that the crown prince had drunk poison from the glass, since he knew strychnine caused bleeding. On the bed lay the body of Mary Vetsera, white, ice-cold, and already quite rigid. The mistaken impression that poison was involved, and even that the baroness had poisoned the crown prince and then killed herself, would persist for some time.|$|E
50|$|Safety rails, or cot sides, can {{be added}} to <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> a <b>bed</b> ({{normally}} a child or elderly person's bed) to stop anyone falling out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> A safety rail is normally a piece of wood that attaches to the side rails on one or both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> They are made {{so that they can be}} easily removed when no longer required.|$|R
5000|$|Comforter sizes {{correspond}} with bed sizes: twin, full, queen, king, and cal-king. Comforter sizes run {{slightly larger than}} mattress sizes to allow for draping over <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> Typical sizes in the United States for comforters are: ...|$|R
60|$|You cannot {{lean out}} of a German bed to pick up {{anything}} off the floor, owing to its box-like formation; {{so he has to}} scramble out after it, and of course every time he does this he barks both his shins twice against <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Greenbrier Sportswagon {{used the}} same body as the [...] "Corvan 95" [...] panel van with the side windows option, but was marketed as a station wagon and was {{available}} with trim and paint options similar to the passenger cars. The [...] "Corvan 95" [...] model was also built in pickup versions; the Loadside was a fairly typical pickup of the era, except for the rear engine, forward controls, and a pit {{in the middle of}} the bed. The more popular Rampside, which had a unique large fold-down ramp on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> for ease of loading wheeled items.|$|E
2500|$|The mortar {{is mounted}} {{on the back of}} a large brass {{sculpture}} of the monster Geryon (wrongly described as a [...] "Chinese dragon" [...] in some sources), associated with the Isle of Gades on which Cádiz stands, with twin tails twisting round to the vent of the mortar which it supports on its back. At the rear of the mortar is a sculpture of the dog Orthrus. Some liberties were taken with the classical depiction of Geryon, such as substituting wings for its multiple heads. The monster and mortar rest on a bed of brass measuring some [...] by , representing a rock on which the monster has alighted. The whole structure measures [...] high and weights 16 tons. On the north <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> is the following inscription: ...|$|E

50|$|Lorries {{are also}} used as bush taxis (French bâché): they are normal lorries (trucks) with benches along <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> for passengers. There is often a cover for <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> as well. Lorries are more robustly made (and give a rougher ride) than {{purpose-built}} passenger vehicles; routes over worse roads and to more remote areas are often serviced by lorries.|$|R
50|$|Another {{style of}} truck bed tonneau cover is a {{retractable}} unit, which is mounted at <b>the</b> front and <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and rolls up or retracts from the tailgate towards the cab. The retractable tonneau is typically made of vinyl, plastic or aluminum. Retractable tonneaus are more secure than soft tonneau covers, since they usually lock and {{are made from}} a harder composition, but they take more time to install and are designed for semi-permanent installation.|$|R

60|$|All this Deerslayer saw, {{and noted}} {{with a degree}} of minuteness that would have done credit to <b>the</b> {{habitual}} observation <b>of</b> his friends, <b>the</b> Delawares. Nor did he fail to perceive the distinction that existed between the appearances on <b>the</b> different <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> which stood against the wall. On that opposite to the one just described, everything was homely and uninviting, except through its perfect neatness. The few garments that were hanging from <b>the</b> pegs were <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coarsest materials and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commonest forms, while nothing seemed made for show. Of ribbons there was not one; nor was there either cap or kerchief beyond those which Hutter's daughters might be fairly entitled to wear.|$|R

50|$|The {{music video}} (which premiered in September 1997) was {{directed}} by Steve Willis and features George Benson towards the end playing a guitar. Throughout the video, Blige sings in many places; many scenes where she is singing include in the car in which she is driving down <b>the</b> street,in <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> in her bedroom, and in her condo. Her love interest is featured prominently throughout the video with her as well especially in the scenes where they are sitting on opposite <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> or while watching television where two people are kissing.|$|R

5000|$|Marshall coils, {{also known}} as wrapped or encased coils or pocket springs, are thin-gauge, barrel-shaped, knotless coils {{individually}} encased in fabric pockets—normally a fabric from man-made, nonwoven fiber. Some manufacturers precompress these coils, which makes the mattress firmer and allows for motion separation between <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> As <b>the</b> springs are not wired together, they work more or less independently: the weight on one spring does not affect its neighbours. More than half the consumers who participated in a survey had chosen to buy pocket spring mattresses.|$|R
50|$|Because <b>the</b> wagon <b>bed</b> is narrow, many {{families}} would construct an “overjet” for additional space. An overjet {{is created by}} nailing boards or planks on top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wagon <b>bed</b> that extend out over the wheels. This would create space to place mattresses for sleeping on either <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> Additional bows would be inserted to stretch the canvas to cover the overjet and keep the weather out. The area under the planks in <b>the</b> wagon <b>bed</b> {{could be used for}} storage. Homesteading prairie families would use the wagons as temporary accommodations until they could build more permanent housing.|$|R

5000|$|In England, the {{ceremony}} usually {{began with a}} priest blessing <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> after which <b>the</b> newlyweds prepared themselves for bed and drank sweet and spicy wine. The groomsmen and the bridesmaids then sat on <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and threw <b>the</b> couple's stockings at them; a hit was believed {{to indicate that the}} thrower would soon marry. Finally the curtains were drawn around <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and <b>the</b> couple were left alone. Some newlyweds refused to take part in <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> ceremony. King Charles I (...) notably barred <b>the</b> door <b>of</b> his bedroom but despite his rejection, the custom remained prevalent for another century among all social classes, including the royal family.|$|R
5000|$|By late 1997, Rossiter in {{particular}} had gained some press attention in his newfound {{status as a}} minor celebrity. He had already appeared as a guest on Never Mind the Buzzcocks and various articles speculated on his sexuality (much to Rossiter's bemusement. As he told Sorted magazine: [...] "I've never hidden the fact that I've slept on both <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and people find that very odd that I was quite happy to say 'yeah, I'm bisexual and it doesn't really matter.") He also hit the headlines due to a war of words between Rossiter and comedian Paul Kaye which culminated in Rossiter headbutting Kaye in a nightclub.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The authors present 3 {{cases of}} {{asphyxia}} caused by atypical compression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neck by <b>the</b> metal <b>bed</b> bars fitted at <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> to prevent falling out. These occurred in 3 elderly {{women living in}} nursing homes, confined to bed by severe neuro-psychiatric disturbances. In all 3 cases, <b>the</b> minor nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skin lesions and absence of blood infiltrations in <b>the</b> anatomic structures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neck had {{made it difficult to}} diagnose <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> death. Inspection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest homes, together with the autopsy findings (acute pulmonary emphysema, conjunctival petechiae, and dark, fluid blood), enabled identification <b>of</b> asphyxia as <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> death and its causal agent as <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> bars.
