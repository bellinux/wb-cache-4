5|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a boom in modern {{architecture}} in Copenhagen both for Danish architecture and for works by international architects. For a few hundred years, virtually no foreign architects had worked in Copenhagen, but <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the millennium {{the city and its}} immediate surroundings have seen buildings and projects designed by top international architects. British design magazine Monocle named Copenhagen the World's best design city 2008.|$|E

In 2009, the Wilanów Palace Museum in Warsaw published a critical edition with a broad introduction by food historian Jarosław Dumanowski presenting Czerniecki's life and work.|$|E
5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the millennium, Danish {{architecture}} has flourished both at {{home and}} abroad. Two important areas of Greater Copenhagen have provided substantial opportunities for architectural developments on the domestic front while a number of firms have gained international recognition, winning important commissions abroad.

5|$|Racial {{tensions}} increased {{after the}} United States Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education to end segregation in public education, which it ruled as unconstitutional. Many segregationists believed the ruling {{would lead to}} interracial dating and marriage. Whites strongly resisted the court's ruling; one Virginia county closed all its public schools to prevent integration. Other jurisdictions simply ignored the ruling. In other ways, whites used stronger measures to keep blacks politically disenfranchised, {{which they had been}} <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the century. Segregation in the South was used to constrain blacks forcefully from any semblance of social equality.|$|E
5|$|The CLB {{directors}} concurred, and on January 19, 1920, {{they formed}} an organization {{under a new}} name, the American Civil Liberties Union. Although {{a handful of other}} organizations in the United States at that time focused on civil rights, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the ACLU was the first that did not represent a particular group of persons, or a single theme. Like the CLB, the NAACP pursued litigation to work on civil rights, including efforts to overturn the disfranchisement of African Americans in the South that had taken place <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the century.|$|E

5|$|The route {{has existed}} as a {{railroad}} corridor <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the 20th century. A highway {{known as the}} Julian road was built by 1913, and was designated as Legislative Route198 in the state highway system by 1935. Route198 was renumbered SR67 in the 1964 state highway renumbering. A freeway south of Lakeside {{was built in the}} late 1960s, and opened to traffic in 1970. Since then, the portion of the highway north of Lakeside has become known for a high number of traffic accidents and related fatalities. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has made several attempts to remedy the problem and make the road safer.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, Frank Schofield, a Canadian {{veterinary}} pathologist, {{determined that}} the cattle were ingesting moldy silage made from sweet clover, {{and that this was}} functioning as a potent anticoagulant. Only spoiled hay made from sweet clover (grown in northern states of the USA and in Canada <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the century) produced the disease. Schofield separated good clover stalks and damaged clover stalks from the same hay mow, and fed each to a different rabbit. The rabbit that had ingested the good stalks remained well, but the rabbit that had ingested the damaged stalks died from a haemorrhagic illness. A duplicate experiment with a different sample of clover hay produced the same result. In 1929, North Dakota veterinarian Dr L.M. Roderick demonstrated that the condition was {{due to a lack of}} functioning prothrombin.|$|E
5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the 21st century, Copenhagen {{has seen}} strong urban and {{cultural}} development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure. The city is the cultural, economic and governmental centre of Denmark; {{it is one}} of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the service sector, especially through initiatives in information technology, pharmaceuticals and clean technology. Since the completion of the Øresund Bridge, Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of Scania and its largest city, Malmö, forming the Øresund Region. With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts. Copenhagen's landmarks such as Tivoli Gardens, The Little Mermaid statue, the Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces, Rosenborg Castle Gardens, Frederik's Church, and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions.|$|E

5|$|<b>Since</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the century, most {{blacks in}} the South, and many poor whites, had been disenfranchised by state legislatures passing constitutions with {{provisions}} that were discriminatory in practice. This meant that their millions of population had no political representation. Most of the South had one-party states. When the resolution came before the Senate, a substitute resolution, one without the rider, was proposed by Joseph L. Bristow of Kansas. It was adopted {{by a vote of}} 64 to 24, with 4 not voting. Nearly a year later, the House accepted the change. The conference report that would become the Seventeenth Amendment was approved by the Senate 42 to 36 on April 12, 1912, and by the House 238 to 39, with 110 not voting on May 13, 1912.|$|E
5|$|Since 2009, the {{intensity}} of the rivalry has waned as the duo's domination of the domestic game has decreased. This is partly due to the resurgence of North Belfast derby clubs, Cliftonville and Crusaders. In 2013, Cliftonville became the first club other than Linfield or Glentoran to lift the league title since Portadown did so in 2002. In 2014, Cliftonville went on to retain the title {{for the first time in}} the club's history, with Crusaders then winning the 2014–15 title in convincing fashion, finishing 10 points ahead of runners-up Linfield. During this time, Glentoran lifted the Irish Cup in 2013 and again in 2015, but their overall fortunes on the field have taken a relative downturn. The club has won only three league titles <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the 21st century; in 2002–03, 2004–05 and 2008–09. Since then, they have finished as low as ninth place in the 2016–17 season. The last season in which the two clubs finished as champions and runners-up in either order was 2008–09, and they have not met in a major domestic cup final since 2006, when they contested both the Irish Cup and the League Cup finals.|$|E
5|$|The Preservation Society {{celebrated its}} 50th anniversary in 2001, {{and as part}} of the year of {{celebrations}} a major new project was launched to once more extend and improve facilities at Tywyn Wharf station. For many years the station had been home to semi-permanent buildings housing the Narrow Gauge Railway Museum, but the new plans for the station included {{the construction of a new}} two-storey building to house the museum and the extension of the existing station building to house a new cafe and booking office. Work began on the first phase of the project in January 2002. In 2003 the railway received a £682,500 Heritage Lottery grant towards the £1,170,000 cost of redeveloping Wharf station, and the new station and museum were officially opened by Prince Charles and The Duchess of Cornwall on 13 July 2005. The railway has seen a steady increase in passengers carried <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> the millennium, with nearly 51,000 passenger bookings and 95,500 passenger journeys recorded in 2006, although this figure is still only around half the peak figure carried in 1973. In 2011, the railway celebrated 60 years of preservation, and received an Engineering Heritage Award from the Institute of Mechanical Engineers in recognition of its importance in Welsh industrial heritage.|$|E
