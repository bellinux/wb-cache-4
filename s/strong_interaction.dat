5|$|As {{described}} by quantum chromodynamics, the <b>strong</b> <b>interaction</b> between quarks is mediated by gluons, massless vector gauge bosons. Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor charge. In the standard framework of particle interactions (part {{of a more}} general formulation known as perturbation theory), gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a virtual emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red quark emits a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes green, and if a green quark absorbs a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, their <b>strong</b> <b>interaction</b> is preserved.|$|E
5|$|Since baryons are {{composed}} of quarks, they participate in the <b>strong</b> <b>interaction.</b> Leptons, on the other hand, are not composed of quarks and as such {{do not participate in}} the <b>strong</b> <b>interaction.</b> The most famous baryons are the protons and neutrons that make up most of the mass of the visible matter in the universe, whereas electrons, the other major component of atoms, are leptons. Each baryon has a corresponding antiparticle known as an antibaryon in which quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks. For example, a proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark, while its corresponding antiparticle, the antiproton, is made of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark.|$|E
5|$|The weak {{interaction}} takes place only at very small, sub-atomic distances, {{less than the}} diameter of a proton. It {{is one of the}} four known fundamental interactions of nature, alongside the <b>strong</b> <b>interaction,</b> electromagnetism, and gravitation.|$|E

40|$|It is studied how <b>strong</b> <b>interactions</b> in the Higgs sector {{can lead}} to {{deviations}} in vector boson selfcouplings. Normally such effects are small due to Veltman’s screening theorem.

5|$|Having {{electric}} charge, mass, color charge, and flavor, quarks are {{the only}} known elementary particles that engage in all four fundamental interactions of contemporary physics: electromagnetism, gravitation, <b>strong</b> <b>interaction,</b> and weak interaction. Gravitation is too weak to be relevant to individual particle interactions except at extremes of energy (Planck energy) and distance scales (Planck distance). However, since no successful quantum theory of gravity exists, gravitation is not described by the Standard Model.|$|E
5|$|Quarks have various {{intrinsic}} properties, including electric charge, mass, color charge, and spin. Quarks are {{the only}} elementary particles in the Standard Model of particle physics to experience all four fundamental interactions, also known as fundamental forces (electromagnetism, gravitation, <b>strong</b> <b>interaction,</b> and weak interaction), {{as well as the}} only known particles whose electric charges are not integer multiples of the elementary charge.|$|E
5|$|The quarks {{are held}} {{together}} by the <b>strong</b> <b>interaction</b> (or strong force), which is mediated by gluons. The protons and neutrons, in turn, are held {{to each other in}} the nucleus by the nuclear force, which is a residuum of the strong force that has somewhat different range-properties (see the article on the nuclear force for more). The gluon is a member of the family of gauge bosons, which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces.|$|E

5|$|Various {{inflammatory}} {{processes and}} cytokines {{may also have}} a role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Inflammation is a general marker of tissue damage in any disease, and may be either secondary to tissue damage in AD or a marker of an immunological response. There is increasing evidence of a <b>strong</b> <b>interaction</b> between the neurons and the immunological mechanisms in the brain. Obesity and systemic inflammation may interfere with immunological processes which promote disease progression.|$|E
5|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{the weak}} interaction (the weak force or weak nuclear force) is {{the mechanism of}} interaction between sub-atomic particles that causes radioactive decay and thus plays {{an essential role in}} nuclear fission. The theory of the weak interaction is sometimes called quantum flavourdynamics (QFD), in analogy with the terms quantum chromodynamics (QCD) dealing with the <b>strong</b> <b>interaction</b> and quantum electrodynamics (QED) dealing with the electromagnetic force. However, the term QFD is rarely used because the weak force is best understood in terms of electro-weak theory (EWT).|$|E
5|$|Its most {{noticeable}} effect {{is due to}} its first unique feature: flavour changing. A neutron, for example, is heavier than a proton (its sister nucleon), but it cannot decay into a proton without changing the flavour (type) {{of one of its}} two down quarks to an up quark. Neither the <b>strong</b> <b>interaction</b> nor electromagnetism permit flavour changing, so this proceeds by weak decay; without weak decay, quark properties such as strangeness and charm (associated with the quarks of the same name) would also be conserved across all interactions.|$|E
50|$|Dual {{resonance}} {{models for}} <b>strong</b> <b>interactions</b> were a relatively popular subject of study between 1968 and 1973.

40|$|We {{calculate}} {{the current and}} differential conductance for the junction between a superconducting (SC) STM tip and a Luttinger liquid (LL). For an infinite single-channel LL, the SC coherence peaks are preserved in the tunneling conductance for interactions weaker than a critical value, while for <b>strong</b> <b>interactions</b> (g < 0. 38), they disappear and are replaced by cusp-like features. For a finite-size wire in contact with non-interacting leads, we find however that the peaks are restored even for extremely <b>strong</b> <b>interactions.</b> In {{the presence of a}} source-drain voltage the peaks/cusps split, and the split is equal to the voltage. At zero temperature, even very <b>strong</b> <b>interactions</b> do not smear the two peaks into a broader one; this implies that the recent experiments of Y. -F. Chen et. al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 036804 (2009)) do not rule out the existence of <b>strong</b> <b>interactions</b> in carbon nanotubes. Comment: 8 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
5|$|Lee and Yang's {{research}} into existing experimental results convinced them that parity was conserved for electromagnetic interactions {{and for the}} <b>strong</b> <b>interaction.</b> For this reason, scientists had expected that {{it would also be}} true for the weak interaction, but it had not been tested, and Lee and Yang's theoretical studies showed that it might not hold true for the weak interaction. Lee and Yang worked out a pencil-and-paper design of an experiment for testing conservation of parity in the laboratory. Lee then turned to Wu for her expertise in choosing and then working out the hardware manufacture, set-up, and laboratory procedures for carrying out this experiment.|$|E
5|$|Margot Kidder as Lois Lane: A {{reporter}} at the Daily Planet, who becomes a romantic interest to Clark Kent. The producers and director had a very specific concept for Lois: liberated, hard-nosed, witty and attractive. Kidder was cast because her performance had a certain spark and vitality, and because of her <b>strong</b> <b>interaction</b> with Christopher Reeve. Over 100 actresses were considered for the role. Margot Kidder (suggested by Stalmaster), Anne Archer, Susan Blakely, Lesley Ann Warren, Deborah Raffin and Stockard Channing screen tested from March through May 1977. The final decision was between Channing and Kidder, with the latter winning the role.|$|E
5|$|During the afternoon, {{satellites}} {{revealed that}} Laura {{had developed a}} deep warm core, a characteristic of a tropical cyclone, but the wind field remained subtropical in nature. By the nighttime hours, the radius of the strongest winds contracted to 80mi (130km), much smaller than what is typical of a subtropical cyclone. However, Laura was still {{under the influence of}} an upper-level low and cloud tops remained shallow. However, the cloud tops became colder overnight and Laura {{was on the verge of}} becoming a tropical cyclone by the morning of September30, but <b>strong</b> <b>interaction</b> with the upper-level low meant it was still subtropical. Despite moving over colder waters, a water vapor satellite image determined that Laura had separated itself from the upper-level low, signifying it had developed into a tropical cyclone. Laura was re-classified as a tropical storm at a relatively high latitude, 40.6°N. Not long after being declared tropical, early signs of an extratropical transition appeared. Cold air began to enter the storm on the west side and forecast models showed Laura becoming extratropical the next morning and non-tropical later the next day.|$|E
