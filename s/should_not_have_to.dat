5|$|Karas, however, {{suffered}} the worst criticisms for its story. Many reviewers {{and even the}} voice actors could not follow its dialogue and presentation. Other reviewers felt the abstract presentation forced viewers who wanted to understand the story, to pay extreme attention to the scant details presented in the show. Reelfilm and DVD Verdict were more critical, stating the viewer <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> resort to reading summaries on the packaging {{to make sense of}} a story populated with incoherent battles and characters hard to tell apart from.|$|E
5|$|Olver {{supports}} {{efforts to}} reduce the number of illegal immigrants entering the United States, but also believes in immigration reform so that qualified immigrants could more easily be granted entrance. Olver also believes that illegal immigrants currently residing in the United States need to be provided with a pathway to citizenship, and that these immigrants <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> return to their countries of origin before obtaining citizenship.|$|E

They part ways for lunch, and Annie meets Silver (Jessica Stroup); however, Naomi pulls Annie away, explaining that Silver makes insulting YouTube videos about people. Naomi invites Annie to her birthday party, and they decide to go shopping together. Harry and guidance counselor Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth) and Mr.Matthews meet with Naomi's parents, who feel that Naomi <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> hand in her assignments on time when she is planning her party. Before she leaves, Naomi's mother, Tracy (Christina Moore), reminds Harry that they dated in high school. Naomi receives a text message from her mother, telling her that she must complete the assignment that night. Annie remembers that she completed a similar assignment for her old school, and offers to give Naomi a copy for inspiration.|$|E

5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} logic of abolitionism {{to the cause of}} women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E

Still, the games would include an Olympic village and protocols which would prepare young athletes for future Olympic competition.|$|E

25|$|When {{this process}} works, {{this type of}} {{neurosis}} may be considered a life-guiding gift from the unconscious, even though the personal journey forced upon the individual sometimes takes decades.

25|$|The {{first debate}} between Linda McMahon and Richard Blumenthal in the 2010 Senate race {{occurred}} on October 4, 2010, moderated by Fox News Channel anchor Bret Baier and televised live on Fox Connecticut. In the debate, McMahon identified Blumenthal {{as a career}} politician, touted her job creation record while CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, criticized Washington partisanship for Republicans not being invited {{to the negotiating table}} during healthcare reform discussions in Congress, and stated that remaining stimulus dollars were a waste that should now be used to pay down debt. Blumenthal as well criticized partisanship, saying that he would have sided with Republicans who voted against the Troubled Assets Relief Program. He also used the debate to argue that middle class tax cuts <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wait for current tax rates on top income earners to be extended, stated that he would oppose special interests in Washington, and criticized McMahon for outsourcing WWE products overseas.|$|E
25|$|Like his renowned British tenor {{predecessors}} Sims Reeves and Edward Lloyd, Coates had a famously protective wife. Moore {{refers to}} Coates' home life as serene, with an adorable spouse, sons and daughters; but he thought, despite Coates's good humour, {{he was not}} a happy person because he {{was too much of a}} worrier. Coates developed financial headaches, too. He wasted a good deal of money in a legal case that he launched against the Performing Right Society, in which he argued that he <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay a royalty to perform music in public which had been brought to him in manuscript, and which therefore, by agreeing to sing it, Coates had encouraged the publishers to publish. He lost the case, and it preyed on his mind and finances for long after, though he refused offers of financial support from other singers. In his last years he thought of going back on the stage and started to slim, but he was seized with anaemia and became permanently confined to bed, frustrated at being unable to assist his country as the Second World War took hold. In July 1940, Gerald Moore presented a half-hour broadcast in tribute to their work together, and received a last letter from him in friendship and gratitude.|$|E

500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode an [...] "C–", noting that episode's plot was [...] "juvenile" [...] when {{compared}} to other Adventure Time episodes that deal with relationships. Despite this, Sava complimented the show for exploring the idea that while public displays of affection may cause some to feel uneasy, people <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> hide their affection so as to appease others. Sava also felt that the titular song was [...] "an easy way of conveying a lot of feeling in a short amount of time".|$|E
500|$|Nixon's {{resignation}} had not {{put an end}} to {{the desire}} among many to see him punished. The Ford White House considered a pardon of Nixon, though it would be unpopular in the country. Nixon, contacted by Ford emissaries, was initially reluctant to accept the pardon, but then agreed to do so. Ford insisted on a statement of contrition, but Nixon felt he had not committed any crimes and <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> issue such a document. Ford eventually agreed, and on September 8, 1974, he granted Nixon a [...] "full, free, and absolute pardon", which ended any possibility of an indictment. Nixon then released a statement: ...|$|E
500|$|A second {{exception}} {{was created in}} Jackson v Horizon Holidays Ltd [...] 1 WLR 1468. Jackson had booked a family holiday in his own name from Horizon Holidays.

The company accepted liability, but claimed that they <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay damages to the family as the doctrine of privity meant they {{were not allowed to}} sue on the contract. The Court of Appeal said that the loss of enjoyment suffered by the family was a loss to Jackson himself. He had paid for a family holiday but not received it, and so damages were awarded.|$|E
