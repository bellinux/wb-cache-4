40|$|In {{this paper}} demand side {{management}} (DSM), characterized by shifting techniques, is applied to a residential microgrid. It is supposed that the microgrid is managed by a prosumer, a decision maker who manages distributed energy sources, storage units, ICT elements, and loads involved in the grid. DSM is considered {{as an integral part}} of the optimal economic short-term management problem such that the allocation of <b>shiftable</b> loads is treated as a variable must be determined simultaneously with all the others variables (i. e. energy exchange with the main grid, internal production, charge/discharge of electrical storage units). This paper focuses on the formulation of an economic model including functional links between <b>shiftable</b> and shifted loads properly linked. The objective function is the minimization of the operation energy costs. The model is implemented using IBM ILOG CPLEX an optimization programming language solver. The analysis shows how the variable allocation of <b>shiftable</b> loads is related to the other variables and how all the variables are linked (directly or indirectly) to the energy price and to the other parameters typical of <b>shiftable</b> energy devices. Moreover, the model allows to easily perform sensitivity analyses by varying the parameters considered. For instance, transitioning from the pre-shift to post-shift state, an improvement of the economic objective corresponds to an enhancement in the utility load profile. A sensitivity analysis is carried out by varying the maximum amount of power exchanged with the main grid. Results provide useful information to find a compromise between connecting interests. Numerical results are presented and discussed...|$|E

The probabilities for starting <b>shiftable</b> loads {{are high in}} hours with low non-shiftable load in the system. Van Den Briel et al.

Kishore and Snyder (2010) apply a stochastic admission control scheme from the telecommunications sector to avoid simultaneous load occurrences. In a similar fashion, Gong et al.

While these approaches characterize ways to break the problem of price-induced herding of loads, they do not characterize appropriate incentive structures that induce truthful behavior of system participants.|$|E

30|$|This paper proposes an {{improved}} method for <b>shiftable</b> position-based dual-image reversible data hiding. During the procedure of embedding data, {{the total number}} of <b>shiftable</b> coordinates is set as the parameter to make a trade-off between distortion and embedding rate. First, the optimal parameter is sought and the one-to-one code table is generated according to the expected embedding rate. Then, the message data is embedded into the cover image through a simple and effective code table lookup scheme to generate two visually similar stego images. During the procedure of data extraction, the message can be extracted in a reverse manner. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method has higher PSNR (peak signal-to-noise ratio) values than our previous work in the case of high embedding rates.|$|E

40|$|Orthogonal wavelet {{transforms}} {{have recently}} {{become a popular}} representation for multiscale signal and image analysis. One of the major drawbacks of these representations is their lack of translation invariance: the content of wavelet subbands is unstable under translations of the input signal. Wavelet transforms are also unstable with respect to dilations of the input signal, and in two dimensions, rotations of the input signal. We formalize these problems by defining a type of translation invariance that we call "shiftability". In the spatial domain, shiftability corresponds {{to a lack of}} aliasing; thus, the conditions under which the property holds are specified by the sampling theorem. Shiftability may also be considered in the context of other domains, particularly orientation and scale.
