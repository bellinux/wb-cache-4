40|$|The {{development}} of space latticed shell structure using fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) tubular members is a promising practice wherein {{the key issue}} is to join different components together.

40|$|The {{results of}} a cyclic test on a precast RC column {{connected}} to the foundation through a grouted <b>sleeve</b> <b>joint</b> are presented. The column, having square cross-section with side length 0. 5 m, was 3. 7 m heigh. It was subjected to an axial compression of 1700 kN using two externally post-tensioned 47 mm-diameter Dywidag bars. A transverse displacement time-history {{was applied to the}} column cross-section 2. 8 m far from the column-foundation joint using a worm screw jack with nominal loading capacity of 500 kN. The test was stopped after 19 displacement cycles, when the complete spalling of the concrete cover took place at the base-joint. Correspondingly, a 15 % degradation of the base-joint resistance was attained and the drift reached 5. 25 %. At this deformation level, the dowel action involving the connection rebars was significant, leading to a maximum slip within the joint of about 7 mm.

MethodThree young hip-disarticulated patients (P 1, P 2 and P 3) were assessed both with their previous prosthesis at first day, then {{four days and}} six months after being trained with a new prosthesis equipped with the Helix 3 D hip joint. Assessments comprised a satisfaction questionnaire, a two-minute walk test and a recording of main spatiotemporal gait parametersResultsAfter four days with the Helix 3 D, the satisfaction for the prosthesis was improved for P 1, unchanged for P 2 and reduced for P 3. Distance walked during two minutes increased for P 1, unchanged for P 2 and slightly improved for P 3. Gait pattern was improved in P 1, only. P 1 abandoned the Helix 3 D at six months due to an ischiatic wound. P 2 and P 3 chose {{not to use the}} Helix {{at the end of the}} four days training period because they could not adapt to the Helix 3 D characteristics (hydraulic control of hip extension and assistance to hip flexion) and because they did not gain enough benefits. Despite much effort to adjust the prosthesis, the three patients definitively abandoned the Helix 3 D because of comfort problems, and decided to walk with their previous prosthesis equipped with a monocentric hip joint or even with crutches only. ConclusionThe Helix 3 D hip joint may need further developments to get clinically relevant for hip-disarticulated amputees who may also need a long training period to adapt to its technical characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A {{variety of}} knee {{injuries}} and pathologies may cause a deficit in knee proprioception which {{may increase the}} risk of reinjury or the progression of disease. Stochastic resonance stimulation is a new therapy which has potential benefits for improving proprioceptive function. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine if stochastic resonance (SR) stimulation applied with a neoprene sleeve could improve knee proprioception relative to a no-stimulation/no-sleeve condition (control) or a sleeve alone condition in the normal, healthy knee. We hypothesized that SR stimulation when applied with a sleeve would enhance proprioception relative to the control and sleeve alone conditions. Methods Using a cross-over within subject design, twenty-four healthy subjects were tested under four combinations of conditions: electrical stimulation/sleeve, no stimulation/sleeve, no stimulation/no sleeve, and stimulation/no <b>sleeve.</b> <b>Joint</b> position sense (proprioception) was measured as the absolute mean difference between a target knee joint angle and the knee angle reproduced by the subject. Testing was conducted during both partial-weight bearing (PWB) and non-weight bearing (NWB) tasks. Differences in joint position sense between the conditions were evaluated by repeated-measures analysis of variance testing. Results Joint position sense error during the stimulation/sleeve condition (2. 48 ° ± 1. 32 °) was found to be more accurate (P Conclusion These results suggest that SR electrical stimulation when combined with a neoprene sleeve is an effective modality for enhancement of joint proprioception in the PWB knee. We believe these results suggest the need for further study of the potential of SR stimulation to correct proprioceptive deficits in a clinical population with knee injury/pathology or in subjects at risk of injury because of a proprioceptive deficit. </p...|$|R

40|$|Pultruded {{glass fibre}} {{reinforced}} polymers (GFRP) profile is a promising structural member for space latticed shell structures {{because of the}} advantageous properties such as high strength-to-weight ratio (in pultrusion direction), corrosion resistance and lower maintenance. In particular, when tubular profiles are used, a better resistance against local buckling, global buckling and lateral torsional buckling can be achieved compared with open sections. Despite the advantageous characteristics, the design and fabrication of tubular connections {{has been identified as}} a critical issue for the proposed applications due primarily to the geometric constraints of the closed shape, the distinct material properties of FRP, and the threedimensional nature of space latticed shell structures. Until recently, {{only a limited number of}} connection systems have been proposed for FRP space latticed shell structures and there is still a need to develop a simple, economic and versatile joining method. This thesis proposed a bolted <b>sleeve</b> <b>joint</b> (BSJ) for assembling GFRP tubular profiles into space latticed shell structures. In the proposed BSJ, the FRP profile and steel connector are telescoped and clamped using mechanical bolts. The end of the steel connector can be incorporated with compatible end fittings for connection to a nodal joint for space latticed shell structure. The proposed BSJ allows the flexibility in adjusting design parameters such as the bolt group configuration, memb 9 er size and type of fastener, depending on the design requirements. In addition, all connecting elements are commercially available and no advanced techniques are required for the fabrication. The joint performances were investigated at three level, namely joint level, component level and structural level. Stage one Goint level) focused on the joint design and performance under static axial loadings. Four batches of specimens were prepared and tested under static axial tension and compression. Design parameters, including the type of fastener (ordinary bolt or blind bolt), member size, and bolt group layout, were selected and examined. A simple analytical design model was proposed to estimate the joint capacity, showing good agreement with experiment. Design recommendations based on the current investigation were also made for the further improvement of joint performance. Stage two (component level) was an experimental and numerical study on the member capacity of pultruded GFRP square tubular profile with BSJ end conditions. Three batches of specimens assembled with FRP profiles in different lengths and BSJs at both ends were prepared and tested under static axial compression. A detailed 3 D FE model considering bolt geometry, contact behaviour, bolt pretension, initial geometric imperfection and FRP failure criterion, was developed and validated with experimental results, showing good agreement. The relationship between effective length factor and member slenderness was derived based on FEA, and then used in conjunction with existing pultruded GFRP box tubular column design equations to predict the member capacity of structural members with BSJ end conditions. The final stage (structural level) investigated the performance of BSJ at a structural level. An experimental investigation was first conducted to obtain the M- () behaviour of BSJ. It was followed by a structural analysis and design of an FRP domed roof with BSJ modelled by spring elements using FEA. The inputs of the joint rotational stiffness and axial stiffness for the springs were determined from the linear portions of the orresponding experimental curves. The ULS and SLS performance of the FRP domed roof were evaluated on a LRFD basis under ASCE- 07 design loads. Parametric studies were also performed to identify the effects of joint rotational stiffness, axial stiffness and the materials (steel or pultruded GFRP) used for structural members on the structural performance. Design recommendations were also developed based on the structural analysis and the parametric studies. Awards: Vice-Chancellor’s Commendation for Masters Thesis Excellence in 2015...|$|R
40|$|The {{work in this}} paper, as {{continuation}} of previous research, improves the previous robot configuration and focuses on the mechatronic design {{and implementation of the}} robotic hanger system for garment inspection. In this improved 3 -DOF smart hanger, three groups of linkages, body, shoulder, and <b>sleeve</b> links (<b>joints),</b> instead of the four-link robot consisting of three revolute joints and one prismatic joint in the previous design, can freely move in the 2 D plane. In comparison with the previous design, the prismatic joint was removed. Link 2 and link 3 are replaced by the body link, and an extra shoulder link is added. Furthermore, the body link always keeps vertical status during motion, and the shoulder and sleeve links provide the convenience for holding the garment. Through these three pairs of improved links, the robotic hanger extends the garment effectively through several motion processes with position and force control where the force control was not considered in the previous design. Due to the hanger complexity and the inherent nonlinearity of the contact behavior, it is difficult, though not impossible, to build a model-based controller such as the proportional-derivative (PD) controller for the present application. Instead, a fuzzy proportional and integral (FPI) controller is applied for implementing the position and force control required for the motion processes. Additionally, for garments with different sizes and materials, the desired values in control system are different. To address this problem, an expert system for automatically selecting the desired position values in the control system is proposed. This intelligent module determines the proper desired positions for various garment sizes. The experimental results for one type of garment material validate the effectiveness of this improved novel smart robotic hanger system. In the future, the intelligent module for selecting different desired values will be further improved. The enhanced module is expected to provide the desired values of the control system when the factors of the garment size and material are considered simultaneously.

40|$|The joint capsule {{is vital}} to the {{function}} of synovial joints. It seals the joint space, provides passive stability by limiting movements, provides active stability via its proprioceptive nerve endings and may form articular surfaces for the joint. It is a dense fibrous connective tissue that is attached to the bones via specialised attachment zones and forms a <b>sleeve</b> around the <b>joint.</b> It varies in thickness according to the stresses to which it is subject, is locally thickened to form capsular ligaments, and may also incorporate tendons. The capsule is often injured, leading to laxity, constriction and/or adhesion to surrounding structures. It is also important in rheumatic disease, including rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, crystal deposition disorders, bony spur formation and ankylosing spondylitis. This article concentrates on the specialised structures of the capsule [...] where capsular tissues attach to bone or form part of the articulation of the joint. It focuses on 2 joints: the rat knee and the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint of the human finger. The attachments to bone contain fibrocartilage, derived from the cartilage of the embryonic bone rudiment and rich in type II collagen and glycosaminoglycans. The attachment changes with age, when type II collagen spreads into the capsular ligament or tendon, or pathology [...] type II collagen is lost from PIP capsular attachments in rheumatoid arthritis. Parts of the capsule that are compressed during movement adapt by becoming fibrocartilaginous. Such regions accumulate cartilage-like glycosaminoglycans and may contain type II collagen, especially in aged material. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

40|$|Background: The optimal age {{at which}} to {{initiate}} for auricular reconstruction is controversial. Rib cartilage growth {{is closely related to}} age and determines the feasibility and outcomes of auricular reconstruction. We developed a method to guide the timing of auricular reconstruction in children with microtia ranging in age from 5 to 10 years. Methods: Rib cartilage and the healthy ear were assessed using low-dose multi-slice computed tomography. The lengths of the eighth rib cartilage and the helix of the healthy ear (from the helical crus to the <b>joint</b> of the <b>helix</b> and the earlobe) were measured. Surgery was performed when the two lengths were approximately equal. Results: The preoperative eighth rib measurements significantly correlated with the intraoperative measurements (P < 0. 05). From 5 to 10 years of age, eighth rib growth was not linear. In 76 (62. 8 %) of 121 patients, the eighth rib length was approximately equal to the helix length in the healthy ear; satisfactory outcomes were achieved in these patients. In 18 (14. 9 %) patients, the eighth rib was slightly shorter than the helix, helix fabrication was accomplished by adjusting the length of the helical crus of stent, and satisfactory outcomes were also achieved. Acceptable outcomes were achieved in 17 (14. 0 %) patients in whom helix fabrication was accomplished by cartilage splicing. In 9 (7. 4 %) patients with insufficient rib cartilage length, the operation was delayed. In one (0. 8 %) patient with insufficient rib cartilage length, which left no cartilage for helix splicing, the result was unsatisfactory. Conclusions: Eighth rib cartilage growth is variable.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to assess the {{suitability}} of cold-formed rectangular hollow sections (RHS) for plastic design. The project involved an extensive range of tests on cold-formed Grade C 350 and Grade C 450 (DuraGal) RHS beams, joints and frames. A large number of finite element analyses was also carried out on models of RHS beams. The conclusion is that cold- formed RHS {{can be used in}} plastic design, but stricter element slenderness (b/t) limits and consideration of the connections, are required. Further research, particularly into the effect of axial compression on element slenderness limits, is required before changes to current design rules can be finalised. Bending tests were performed on cold-formed RHS to examine the web and flange slenderness required to maintain the plastic moment for a large enough rotation suitable for plastic design. The major conclusions of the beam tests were: (i) Some sections which are classified as Compact or Class 1 by current steel design specifications do not maintain plastic rotations considered sufficient for plastic design. (ii) The current design philosophy, in which flange and web slenderness limits are independent, is inappropriate. An interaction formula is required, and simple formulations are proposed for RHS. Connection tests were performed on various types of knee joints in RHS, suitable for the column - rafter connection in a portal frame. The connection types investigated were welded stiffened and unstiffened rigid knee connections, bolted plate knee joints, and welded and bolted internal <b>sleeve</b> knee <b>joints,</b> for use in RHS portal frames. The ability of the connections to act as plastic hinges in a portal frame was investigated. The most important finding of the joint tests was the unexpected fracture of the cold-formed welded connections under opening moment before significant plastic rotations occurred. The use of an internal sleeve moved the plastic hinge in the connection away from the connection centre- line thus eliminating the need for the weld between the RHS, or the RHS and the stiffening plate, to carry the majority of the load. The internal sleeve connections were capable of sustaining the plastic moment for large rotations considered suitable for plastic design. Tests on pinned-base portal frames were also performed. There were three separate tests, with two different ratios of vertical to horizontal point loads, simulating gravity and horizontal wind loads. Two grades of steel were used for comparison. The aims of the tests were to examine if a plastic collapse mechanism could form in a cold-formed RHS frame, and to investigate if plastic design was suitable for such frames. In each frame, two regions of highly concentrated curvature were observed before the onset of local buckling, which indicated the formation of plastic hinges and a plastic collapse mechanism. An advanced plastic zone structural analysis which accounted for second order effects, material non-linearity and member imperfections slightly overestimated the strength of the frames. The analysis slightly underestimated the deflections, and hence the magnitude of the second order effects. A second order plastic zone analysis, which did not account for the effects of structural imperfections, provided the best estimates of the strengths of the frames, but also underestimated the deflections. While cold-formed RHS did not satisfy the material ductility requirements specified for plastic design in some current steel design standards, plastic hinges and plastic collapse mechanisms formed. This suggests that the restriction on plastic design for cold-formed RHS based on insufficient material ductility is unnecessary, provided that the connections are suitable for plastic hinge formation, if required. A large number of finite element analyses were performed to simulate the bending tests summarised above, and to examine various parameters not studied in the experimental investigation. To simulate the experimental rotation capacity of the RHS beams, a sinusoidally varying longitudinal local imperfection was prescribed. The finite element analysis determined similar trends as observed experimentally, namely that the rotation capacity depended on both the web slenderness and flange slenderness, and that for a given section aspect ratio, the relationship between web slenderness and rotation capacity was non-linear. The main finding of the finite element study was that the size of the imperfections had an unexpectedly large influence on the rotation capacity. Larger imperfections were required in the more slender sections to simulate the experimental results. There should be further investigation into the effect of varying material properties on rotation capacity...|$|R
