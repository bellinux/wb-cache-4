The two cable-stay <b>support</b> <b>towers</b> were started in March (eastern tower) and April 2015 (western tower). Approach spans were underway by April 2016. By August 2016, the project had passed the halfway mark, and the two cable <b>support</b> <b>towers</b> were already more than 200 ft high.|$|R

5000|$|A Diffuser-Augmented Wind Turbine (DAWT) is a {{wind turbine}} {{modified}} with a cone shaped wind diffuser {{that is used}} to increase the efficiency of converting wind power to electrical power. The increased efficiency is possible due to the increased wind speeds that the diffuser can provide. In traditional bare turbines, the rotor blades are vertically mounted {{at the top of a}} <b>support</b> <b>tower</b> or shaft. In a DAWT, the rotor blades are mounted within the diffuser, which is then placed on the top of the <b>support</b> <b>tower.</b> Additional modifications can be made to the diffuser in order to further increase efficiency.|$|E

50|$|Engineer James Lindsay {{designed}} the Torre de Herveo in 1922. His plan {{was put to}} work afterwards. When its construction was finished, the tower became a tall <b>support</b> <b>tower</b> since then until 1961. It became a monument since the shutdown of the cableway.|$|E
50|$|The {{line was}} {{designed}} and the system was delivered by the French company Poma, and the construction {{was carried out by}} Turkish company Baytur. It is a two-station overhead transport system without any <b>support</b> <b>tower</b> {{in the middle of the}} line distance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sequence}} of construction {{is similar to}} traditional concrete bridge building, i.e., build the <b>support</b> <b>towers</b> (columns), build the temporary falsework, build the deck, perform finish work. The principal differences are as follows: ...|$|R
2500|$|Notice how {{the visual}} {{impact of the}} {{overhead}} electrification has been minimised by placing the <b>supporting</b> <b>towers</b> for the catenary on the alternate centre lines of the viaduct's columns, thus maintaining symmetry of form.|$|R
50|$|In the Carboniferous, {{the great}} {{tropical}} rainforests of Euramerica <b>supported</b> <b>towering</b> lycopodiophyta, a heterogeneous mix of vegetation, {{as well as}} a great diversity of animal life: giant dragonflies, millipedes, cockroaches, amphibians, and the first amniotes.|$|R
50|$|On July 19, 2006, {{the final}} design {{alternatives}} for the bridge were announced. The three designs included a three-span arch, a cable-stayed design with three towers, and a cable-stayed type {{with a single}} A-shaped <b>support</b> <b>tower.</b> It was also announced that the projected cost for the bridge would be $203 million.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{problems}} {{occurred when}} deployment was attempted in 1961 {{with the first}} production model at Point Arena Air Force Station in California. When the radar finally deployed, bearing problems often occurred due to the 85.5-ton antenna weight. Failures of the 9-foot hydrostatic bearing often caused the early closure of some sites due to catastrophic damage to the <b>support</b> <b>tower,</b> sail, and feed horn.|$|E
50|$|The facade {{retains its}} {{original}} face brickwork and rendered decoration, although considerable changes {{have occurred to}} the window openings and types. Internally, some evidence of the original structure and finishes remains, particularly the pressed metal ceilings {{to the first floor}} of the left hand bay. A brick water tank <b>support</b> <b>tower</b> exists at roof level at the rear of the building.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>support</b> <b>towers</b> may be built segmentally.

50|$|The cable for {{the bridge}} totals 4,342 ft and {{was made in}} England. The dial of the sundial and a small plaza beneath the <b>support</b> <b>tower</b> are {{decorated}} with broken white tile from Spain. The bridge's deck is surfaced with translucent structural glass from Quebec, which is illuminated from beneath and glows aquamarine at night. The steel support structure of the bridge was made in Vancouver, Washington and transported in 40 ft sections by truck to Redding.|$|E
50|$|By {{the mid-1970s}} the {{mountain}} had been greatly expanded, {{with a second}} gondola added in the Lionshead area, which also included a residences and shops {{at the base of}} the slopes. On 26 March 1976, disaster struck the gondola when carrying cable snagged on a <b>support</b> <b>tower</b> and two cabins derailed, killing four people and injuring eight. The gondola was closed for the remainder of the season. Soon after the original gondola in Vail Village was replaced with a double chairlift.|$|E

50|$|Telecommunication systems {{running along}} power lines or aerial tramways are often built as aerial cables {{as they can}} be easily {{installed}} on the pylons or tramway <b>support</b> <b>towers.</b> However these cables must be designed for higher forces as span lengths are longer.|$|R
40|$|Cascade {{failure of}} {{electrical}} transmission lines {{can be caused}} by a number of reasons. Dynamic forces like equipment failure, conductors rupture in any span, heavy wind loads, snow accumulation on conductors and structural members or ice shedding are known to be the main reasons for such a collapse. The primary objective of this investigation was to study the dynamic behavior of <b>supporting</b> <b>towers,</b> collapse of <b>supporting</b> <b>towers</b> and longitudinal dynamic maximum forces that were induced on the adjacent <b>supporting</b> <b>towers</b> due to conductors rupture in any span. The study was performed on transmission lines, whose <b>supporting</b> <b>towers</b> were modeled with (a) Linear elastic truss and beam elements, (b) Moment-Curvature beam elements, with elastic-plastic material properties, and (c) Towers with load limiting devices or tower load controllers (TLC). The transmission lines modeled with linear elastic truss and beam elements were used to perform the free vibration analysis to calculate the damping properties of the towers and the transmission lines. Each of these models was used to conduct static and transient dynamic analyses due to broken conductors in the middle span. The transient dynamic analyses were carried out with bare conductor (no-ice-loads) loading and 25 -mm (1 -inch) radial ice loading conditions. The linear material models do not predict the failure or cascading of the transmission line towers, however considering the elements as moment-curvature beam models with elasto-plastic materials showed that the towers adjacent to the span, where conductors are ruptured, experienced large impact forces causing the adjacent towers to collapse. And the use of TLCs was able to limit the length of this cascade failure...|$|R
50|$|It covers an area ıf 480 m2. The fortification's walls, {{built in}} ashlar and mortar, are 2 - 20 m high and 2 - 3 m thick. Between the cylinder-formed bastions, there are {{overhung}} <b>support</b> <b>towers</b> {{in various forms}} such as square, rectangular and round.|$|R
50|$|The main tower {{consists}} of four vertical cylinders standing next to and across from each other. Each cylinder is divided horizontally in its center by a mold in the facade. Notably, these cylinders do not stand on the ground; they are suspended on a central <b>support</b> <b>tower.</b> During the construction, individual floors were assembled {{on the ground and}} then elevated. The tower has a diameter of 52.30 m and it has 22 occupied floors, two of which are basements and 18 serve as office space.|$|E
50|$|After {{discussing}} the danger, Dan decides {{to jump off}} the lift. Upon hitting the ground, he suffers a compound fracture on both of his legs. Soon, his screams and the scent of blood attracts a pack of wolves. Joe, now fearing for Dan's safety, decides {{to try to get}} to the ground by traversing the suspension cable between the lifts and steel <b>support</b> <b>tower.</b> However, as wolves close in on Dan, he returns to the chair and holds Parker as Dan is brutally torn apart by the wolves.|$|E
50|$|The large {{format line}} array {{has become the}} {{standard}} for large concert venues and outdoor festivals, where such systems can be flown (rigged, suspended) from a structural beam, ground <b>support</b> <b>tower</b> or off a tall A-frame truss tower. Since the enclosures rig together and hang from a single point, they are more convenient to assemble and cable than other methods of arraying loudspeakers. The lower portion of the line array is generally curved backward to increase dispersion {{at the bottom of}} the array and allow sound to reach more audience members. Typically, cabinets used in line arrays are trapezoidal, connected by specialized rigging hardware.|$|E
