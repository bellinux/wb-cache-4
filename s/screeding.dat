25|$|There {{are also}} other methods and {{materials}} to create pavements that have appearance of brick pavements. The first method to create brick texture is to heat an asphalt pavement and use metal wires to imprint a brick pattern using a compactor to create stamped asphalt. A similar {{method is to}} use rubber imprinting tools to press over {{a thin layer of}} cement to create decorative concrete. Another method is to use a brick pattern stencil and apply a surfacing material over the stencil. Materials that can be applied to give the color of the brick and skid resistance can be in many forms. An example is to use colored polymer-modified concrete slurry which can be applied by <b>screeding</b> or spraying. Another material is aggregate-reinforced thermoplastic which can be heat applied to the top layer of the brick-pattern surface. Other coating materials over stamped asphalt are paints and two-part epoxy coating.|$|E
50|$|A common {{flatwork}} form has riser strips on top {{such that}} the screed is 3/8-1/2 in. (9 to 12 mm) above final pavement elevation. Mechanical screeds are preferable to manual. The riser strips are removed to guide compaction. Immediately after <b>screeding,</b> the concrete is compacted to improve the bond and smooth the surface. Excessive compaction of pervious concrete results in higher compressive strength, but lower porosity (and thus lower permeability).|$|E
50|$|In the US, <b>screeding</b> is {{the process}} a person called a {{concrete}} finisher performs by cutting off excess wet concrete to bring the top surface of a slab to the proper grade and smoothness. A power concrete screed has a gasoline motor attached which helps smooth and vibrate concrete as it is flattened. After the concrete is flattened it is smoothed with a concrete float or power trowel. A concrete floor is sometimes called a solid ground floor.|$|E

40|$|Construction wastes {{have become}} {{the major source of}} solid wastes in Hong Kong. Thousands of tonnes of solid wastes are {{produced}} every year from construction and demolition activities. Increasing generation of these wastes has caused significant impacts on the environment and aroused growing public concerns. Therefore, the minimization of construction wastes has become a pressing issue. This paper aims to: i) revealing the status of construction wastes; ii) investigating the effectiveness of prefabrication in terms of waste reduction in replacing traditional wet-trade practices; iii) examining the factors that help minimize construction wastes by the adoption of prefabrication; and iv) exploring the current waste reduction situations after adoption of prefabrication by comparing with in-situ construction. It investigates wastes generated from various wet-trade construction activities such as in-situ concreting, timber formwork, bricklaying, plastering, <b>screeding,</b> tiling, rebar fixing and bamboo scaffolding. Six major reasons for the excessive construction wastage are known to be: i) cutting; ii) over ordering; iii) damaging during transportation; iv) losing during installation; v) poor workmanship; and vi) change of design. From the findings of a structured interview survey of thirty-one construction practitioners, "timber formwork" is found to be having the greatest potential for cutting scrap, and wastes from "poor workmanship" can be greatly reduced by adopting prefabrication in construction. Furthermore, after the adoption of prefabrication, wastage generation can be greatly reduced in various wet-trade activities including concreting, rebar fixing, bricklaying, drywall, plastering, <b>screeding</b> and tiling. Especially in plastering, the waste reduction can be reduced by 100 %. It is concluded that prefabrication of building components is one of the effective technologies of waste minimization.

With regard to the currently on-going repairs and reconstructions of panel houses in the Czech Republic approaching the end of their expected lifetime, attention is paid to PMM (Polymer-Modified Mortars) intended for surface treatment such as screed or adhesive materials. For the design of adhesive and <b>screeding</b> substances (recommended for ETICS – External Thermal Insulation Composite Systems) use the alternative raw material sources, waste diatomaceous earth is used from the production at the firm LB MINERALS, s. r. o.

This raw material is delivered in moist, therefore, it is necessary to dry it before the use and consequently mill it so to be able to replace milled limestone by the modified diatomaceous earth in the original formula...|$|E
40|$|Generation of {{construction}} wastes constitutes the major impact to the environment. Studies have been directed towards reducing wastes {{at the various}} construction processes. However, contractors in Hong Kong are rather conservative and lack motivation in developing new technology for waste minimization. This paper examines the benefits of using prefabrication in reducing material wastage levels for some traditional in-situ trades such as concreting, rebar fixing, bricklaying, drywall, plastering, <b>screeding</b> and tiling in Hong Kong. From the measurement of the thirty construction projects, {{it is found that}} waste levels of all major construction trades can be effectively reduced, which is particularly significant in the trade of plastering where 100 % saving is achieved after adopting prefabrication. The standardized design of the building can also be useful in the adoption of prefabrication for the private housing projects. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Concrete [© The Concrete Society] and further information can be found at www. concrete. org. ukThere is a growing demand for in-situ concrete industrial floor slabs throughout the world. The increase of internal floor space required for warehousing and manufacturing processes has led to the majority of this growth. This demand has been coupled with client requirements for extended life expectancies and tighter tolerances in both level and flatness. Whilst new machinery such as laser <b>screeding</b> plant has helped in providing quicker and more accurate concrete placement, the greater size of the pour creates an increased risk of thermal and hygral movement. All concrete slabs must consequently accommodate significant shrinkage throughout their lifespan, because if restricted, additional stresses and cracking will occur. Some form of control to prevent premature degradation is therefore required within the structure. This is commonly achieved with the use of joints (controlled cracks) to enable the concrete to move at designated locations, leaving the remainder of the slab relatively free of restraint-induced stress. Unfortunately, these areas often become the main cause of failure if incorrectly designed or constructed...|$|E

40|$|The {{use of a}} {{high range}} water reducer in bridge floors was {{initiated}} by an Iowa Highway Research Board project (HR- 192) in 1977 for two basic reasons. One {{was to determine the}} feasibility of using a high range water reducer (HRWR) in bridge floor concrete using conventional concrete proportioning, transporting and finishing equipment. The second was to determine the performance and protective qualities against chloride intrusion of a dense concrete bridge floor by de-icing agents used on Iowa's highways during winter months. This project was basically intended to overcome some problems that developed in the original research project. The problems alluded to are the time limits from batching to finishing; use of a different type of finishing machine; need for supplemental vibration {{on the surface of the}} concrete during the <b>screeding</b> operation and difficulty of texturing. The use of a double oscillating screed finishing machine worked well and supplemental vibration on one of the screeds was not needed. The limit of 45 minutes from batching the concrete to placement on the deck was verified. This is a maximum when the HRWR is introduced at the batch plant. The problem of texturing was not solved completely but is similar to our problems on the dense "Iowa System" overlay used on bridge deck repair projects. This project reinforced some earlier doubts about using truck transit mixers for mixing and transporting concrete containing HRWR when introduced at the batch plant...|$|E
40|$|The {{resistance}} of concrete surfaces to {{various types of}} wear can be a defining performance characteristic in certain applications. Some concrete structures are required to be abrasion-resistant; among them are dams, canals, roads, floors, footpaths, parking lots, and paths in parks. The work reported in this paper {{is based on a}} laboratory study of the concrete-surface treatments (CSTs) consisting of dry shake and <b>screeding.</b> Four control concrete mixtures were prepared with ordinary Portland cement (OPC), having a cement content (CC) of 350 kg/m 3 at water-cementitious ratio (w/cc) = 0. 70, 0. 75; and 280 kg/m 3 CC of w/cc = 0. 80, 0. 85. Other concrete mixtures were then prepared by substituting OPC in the control mixtures with 10, 20, 30, and 40 % local raw clay. Compressive strength, abrasion resistance, and air permeability of the surface-treated concretes were measured at the ages of six months, while drying shrinkage was monitored for up to year. Drying shrinkage of concrete reduced with decrease in w/cc ratio and increased with increase in raw clay content. Among all the mixtures, the control concrete of w/cm ratio = 0. 70 and the claycement concrete containing w/cm= 0. 80 at 70 % OPC/ 30 % raw clay showed the least and highest shrinkage increments respectively. Abrasion {{resistance of}} concrete, measured by the rotating-cutter method, increased with increasing clay content and decreasing compressive strength. However, abrasion performance results of clay-cement concrete mixtures with CSTs were generally higher. Air permeability of the concretes was measured and its relationship with the depth of abrasion of the concrete was examine...|$|E
