50|$|Fuel {{economy at}} <b>steady</b> <b>speeds</b> with {{selected}} vehicles was studied in 2010. The most recent study indicates greater fuel efficiency at higher speeds than earlier studies; for example, some vehicles achieve better fuel economy at 100 km/h {{rather than at}} 70 km/h, although not their best economy, such as the 1994 Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera with the LN2 2.2L engine, which has its best economy at 90 km/h (8.1 L/100 km mpg), and gets 2 mpg better economy at 105 km/h than at 72 km/h (9.4 L/100 km mpg vs 22 mpg).

50|$|Overdrive ('D', 'OD', or a boxed D or {{the absence}} of an {{illuminated}} 'O/D OFF'): This mode is used in some transmissions to allow early computer-controlled transmissions to engage the automatic overdrive. In these transmissions, Drive (D) locks the automatic overdrive off, but is identical otherwise. OD (Overdrive) in these cars is engaged under <b>steady</b> <b>speeds</b> or low acceleration at approximately 35 - 45 mph. Under hard acceleration or below 35 - 45 mph, the transmission will automatically downshift. Other vehicles with this selector (for example light trucks) will not only disable up-shift to the overdrive gear, but keep the remaining gears available for use of engine braking. Drivers should verify the behaviour of this switch and consider the benefits of reduced friction brake use when city driving where speeds typically do not necessitate the overdrive gear.|$|E
5000|$|People jaywalk {{for various}} reasons, {{including}} convenience {{and sometimes even}} personal safety, generally to cross the street. Going to a crosswalk can require a long detour. Pedestrians are often forced to walk outside crosswalks, when they are blocked by cars due to traffic congestion or drivers stopping too far forward. The common practice of car-centric traffic-signal synchronization produces green waves for motorists but not necessarily for pedestrians, who may encounter little or no conflicting traffic at cross streets where signals instruct them to wait. Where signalized crosswalks require a pedestrian to trigger their operation, they are at times unusable for some Jewish people who observe Shabbat. Also, pedestrians are generally unwilling to observe lengthy wait times at signals. They {{are also more likely}} to make [...] "informal crossings" [...] at wide roads, or at locations where formal crosswalks are simply too distant to be practical for them to use. Also, pedestrians may dislike using intersections for other reasons, such as being uncomfortable dealing with traffic from a multitude of directions (whereas jaywalking at a location distant from an intersection results in the need to observe only two directions of traffic), or wanting to avoid the extra air emissions generated by vehicles stopping and starting (given that vehicular emissions are significantly less when vehicles are moving at <b>steady</b> <b>speeds).</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} the energy consumption for a mid-size electric vehicle(EV) under various conditions. In order to analyze which driving style {{is more efficient}} {{in terms of the}} system of the EV, we develop the electric vehicle model and apply several types of speed profiles such as different <b>steady</b> <b>speeds,</b> acceleration/deceleration, and a real world driving cycle including the elevation profile obtained from a GPS device. The results show that the energy consumption of the EV is affected by the operating efficiency of components when driving at low speed, while it depends on required power at wheels when driving at high speed. Also this paper investigates the effect of the elevation of a road and the rate of electrical braking on the energy consumption as well as the fuel economy of a conventional vehicle model under the same conditions.

40|$|Our main {{goals in}} this study were twofold: (1) to {{investigate}} the variation in instantaneous aerodynamic force production during the wingbeat cycle of birds flying across a range of <b>steady</b> <b>speeds</b> and (2) to quantify the inertial costs of flapping flight, along with an estimate of the amount of wing kinetic energy (Ek) that is transferred to whole body Ek or potential energy (Ep). In doing so, we sought to test the current assumption in the avian flight literature that all of the Ek imparted to the wings is recovered as useful aerodynamic work (e. g. Pennycuick and Lock, 1976; Pennycuick et al., 2000; Askew et al., 2001; Tobalske et al., 2003). If this is the case, the energy required to accelerate the wing does not represent an incremental cost to the overall energy requirement for flight of a bird because the Ek added to the wing eventually acts to support or propel the bird. However, while this assumption is longstanding, experimental support is generally limited to slo...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} was {{performed with the}} purpose of comparing the arodynamic drag of an automobile as measured in a full-scale wind tunnel with the drag as measured on the road. A definition of the drag coefficient as measured both on the road and in the wind tunnel is given in advance in order to allow a comparison to be made between the two operating conditions. Three medium size european cars were selected, one notch-back type and two hatch-back types. Road testing was mainly based on the coast-down method. The total resistance was determined by statistical analysis of the experimental results. The theoretical basis and the specifications of the procedure are investigated and justified. Additional outdoor and indoor tests were carried out in order to isolate the aerodynamic drag. The wind tunnel tests were conducted on the same cars fully equipped as tested on the road and in the same speed range. The wind tunnel tests being executed at <b>steady</b> <b>speeds,</b> however, supplementary road tests were performed {{in order to determine the}} effect of the deceleration on the aerodynamic drag.

40|$|The fuel {{consumption}} {{is an important}} component of the vehicle operating cost which is a significant component of the total transportation cost.

Minimizing uncertainties in fuel consumption measurements enhance the quality of data.

The cylinder diameter d was 210 mm, and measurements were made of pressures around its circumference at elevations between 2. 4 d below still water level to 0. 7 d above, at Froude numbers (based on d) up to 1. 67. The tests were carried out at a constant ratio of Reynolds number to Froude number of 2. 79 x 10 (5). The total resistance coefficient reached a maximum at a Froude number of about 1, when {{that part of the}} loading that {{can be attributed to the}} presence of the free surface was equivalent to the submerged form drag on a length of cylinder of about 0. 9 d.

40|$|Unsteady {{water flows}} {{are common in}} nature, yet the {{swimming}} performance of fishes is typically evaluated at constant, <b>steady</b> <b>speeds</b> in the laboratory. We examined how cyclic changes in water flow velocity affect the swimming performance and energetics of a labriform swimmer, the shiner surfperch, Cymatogaster aggregata, during station holding. Using intermittent-flow respirometry, we measured critical swimming speed (U-crit), oxygen consumption rates (MO 2) and pectoral fin use in steady flow versus unsteady flows with either low-[0. 5 body lengths (BL) s(- 1) ] or high-amplitude (1. 0 BL s(- 1)) velocity fluctuations, with a 5 s period. Individuals in low-amplitude unsteady flow performed as well as fish in steady flow. However, swimming costs in high-amplitude unsteady flow were on average 25. 3 % higher than in steady flow and 14. 2 % higher than estimated values obtained from simulations based on the non-linear relationship between swimming speed and oxygen consumption rate in steady flow. Time-averaged pectoral fin use (fin-beat frequency measured over 300 s) was similar among treatments. However, measures of instantaneous fin use (fin-beat period) and body movement in high-amplitude unsteady flow indicate that individuals with greater variation in the duration of their fin beats were better at holding station and consumed less oxygen than fish with low variation in fin-beat period. These {{results suggest that the}} costs of swimming in unsteady flows are context dependent in labriform swimmers, and may be influenced by individual differences in the ability of fishes to adjust their fin beats to the flow environment...|$|E
