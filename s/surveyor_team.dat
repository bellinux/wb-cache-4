5000|$|The LOSS Program {{includes}} a first-response {{team with the}} objectives of delivering immediate services to the survivors of a suicide {{at the time of}} the death. This team is made up of para-professional survivor volunteers and staff members of the Baton Rouge Crisis Intervention Center, located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The LOSS Program is different from other postvention programs in several ways. First, the LOSS team physically goes to the scenes of the suicides to begin helping the survivors to cope with their loss as close to the event of death as possible. Members of this team can provide access to the needed resources and can begin the grieving process at the scene of the death. Second, since the LOSS team includes survivor volunteers at the scene, an immediate and meaningful bond is established between the newly bereaved individuals and the para-professional <b>surveyor</b> <b>team</b> members. This bond allows for the start of a conversation about the grief and the potential for hope of a suicide between the bereaved and the crisis team members. Third, the LOSS team has a strong relationship with other first responders, such as law enforcement, emergency services, fire departments, funeral home representatives, and more. This relationship allows the newly bereaved to have a larger variety of choices in regards to coping with a suicide compared to other survivors who might not have access to this program. This model of postvention provides referrals for additional support to all survivors and individuals at the scene of the suicide [...] The model of the LOSS Program has changed the scene of the suicide to a more [...] "concerned and caring environment" [...] for all individuals and survivors.|$|E
5000|$|The Tongpu Railway {{was built}} during Yan Xishan's {{administration}} of Shanxi Province. [...] Yan initially {{appealed to the}} central government of the Republic of China for assistance to build a railway in Shanxi, and after being denied funding in 1928, embarked on his own railway building project. [...] He hired a German <b>surveyor</b> <b>team</b> to plan the line. In 1930, when Yan lost power during the Central Plains War, the railway project temporarily halted. [...] In 1932, Yan regained control of Shanxi and formed the Jinsui (Shanxi-Suiyuan) Army Construction Corp to build the line as a [...] narrow gauge railway, which the German team recommended to save cost. [...] Construction began simultaneously on the North and South Tongpu Lines in May 1933. [...] On August 1, 1935, the Taiyuan to Yuanping section entered into operation. [...] By August 1937, the North Tongpu Line had reached within 8 km of Datong but {{the fall of the}} city to the invading Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War halted construction. [...] In 1939, the Japanese used forced labor to work on the remainder of the line. [...] Guerilla activity limited travel speed on the line to 25-35 km/h. [...] After the end of World War II, Yan regained control of the Shanxi and the Tongpu Railway. During the ensuing Chinese Civil War, Communist forces and partisans sabotaged the North Tongpu Line, rendering it unusable until after the conflict. Reconstruction began in November 1949 and the entire line was converted into standard gauge and reopened to traffic in August 1951. In 1957, work began on a bypass between Ningwu and Xuangang through the Duanjialing Tunnel, which at 3,345 m was the second longest railway tunnel in China at the time. [...] The tunnel was completed in 1959. [...] In the early 1980s, the North Tongpu Line underwent electrification to increase coal transport capacity.|$|E

Because in all this time “Perencanaan dan Pengendalian Penanganan Bencana (P 3 B) ” <b>surveyor</b> <b>team</b> does not have clear standard criteria to execute the compiling rehabilitation and reconstruction action after disaster. Method Multi Experts Multi Criteria Decision Making (MEMCDM) step {{is to determine the}} alternative, assessment scale, criteria, criteria quality, criteria quality negation, criteria aggregation, and the qualification expert score. In the stage of expert qualification score for primary and secondary data is different. In secondary data, the qualification score is based on the usage of expert amount. Meanwhile, for secondary data, the expert qualification score is based on the criteria amount which is chosen by the user. Training data that has been processed using method Multi Experts Multi Criteria Decision Making (MEMCDM) can form a pattern system to assess damage and losses after natural disasters. There for it could facilitate a team of surveyors in assessing the damage and losses after natural disasters...|$|E

40|$|A {{technical}} analysis {{was made of}} the Assumed Similarity instrument used to measure team effectiveness of student <b>surveyor</b> <b>teams.</b> When each item of 5 clusters was considered separately, the reliabilities for ASo, ASp, and ASn were 0. 93, 0. 83, and 0. 95, respectively. The internal consistency of separate clusters was low, and little intercorrelation existed between clusters. ASo and ASp were so highly correlated that separate treatment was not considered advisable. The ASp score was not considered reliable and partly independent of ASn and ASo. The ASo score as determined from differences on items within a cluster correlated highly with ASo's of other clusters, which indicated that assumed similarity was a general attitude essentially independent of the content of test items.

Vegetation assessments include many sources of error related to overlooking and misidentification, that are usually influenced by some factors, such as cover estimate subjectivity, observer biased species lists and experience of the botanist. The vegetation assessment protocol adopted in the Italian forest monitoring programme (CONECOFOR) contains a Quality Assurance programme. The paper presents the different phases of QA, separates the 5 main critical points of the whole protocol as sources of random or systematic errors. Examples of Measurement Quality Objectives (MQOs) expressed as Data Quality Limits (DQLs) are given for vascular plant cover estimates, {{in order to establish}} the reproducibility of the data. Quality control activities were used to determine the ‘‘distance’’ between the <b>surveyor</b> <b>teams</b> and the control team. Selected data were acquired during the training and inter-calibration courses. In particular, an index of average cover by species groups was used to evaluate the random error (CV 4 %) as the dispersion around the ‘‘true values’’ of the control team. The systematic error in the evaluation of species composition, caused by overlooking or misidentification of species, was calculated following the pseudo-turnover rate; detailed species censuses on smaller sampling units were accepted as the pseudoturnover which always fell below the 25 % established threshold; species density scores recorded at community level (100 m 2 surface) rarely exceeded that limit...|$|R

5000|$|Beginning in 1930, Mackay {{supervised}} several {{aerial survey}} expeditions to Central Australia. The 1930 expedition surveyed the south-western {{corner of the}} Northern Territory. Mackay utilised two ANEC III aircraft for the survey, piloted by Captain Frank Neale and Captain H. B. Hussey, with Commander Harry T. Bennett as the navigator and <b>surveyor.</b> The <b>team</b> employed Bob Buck, a well known bushman of Central Australia, to establish a base in the Ehrenberg Range west of Alice Springs. Buck set out with a camel team two {{months prior to the}} survey party to take fuel and supplies to the base known as Ilbilba (also spelt Ilbpilla). [...] Using the base as the hub of an imaginary wheel, Commander Bennett had the aircraft fly directly outbound for 250 miles, turn to fly the short side of a triangle, then fly directly inbound to the base making another 250 mile spoke of the wheel. The party made 15 survey flights over 24 days covering an area of 67,000 square miles, mapping and correcting the dimensions of Lake Amadeus and finding a previously unknown Lake Mackay, (...) [...] the second largest lake in Australia. Lake Anec to the west-north-west of Lake Hopkins was named after the aircraft type. The expedition finished at Adelaide on 28 June 1930.|$|R
5000|$|After the {{accident}} that cost Ayrton Senna his life during a race in 1994, Stirano was appointed by Williams as expert surveyor {{on the side of}} the Williams team, which was being accused of causing {{the accident}} due to them having created an undersized steering column. The enquiry, which started in 1997, had Stirano, Diego Milen, Roberto Vitali and Giovanni Saccenti (the <b>surveyors</b> <b>team</b> for Williams) up against Tommaso Carletti and Mauro Forghieri. On officially returning to Formula 1 in 1995, Stirano, during his short adventure in this affluent championship, was first appointed as Sports Director and then as Team Manager of Forti Corse : the team lined up drivers such as Pedro Paulo Diniz and Roberto Moreno. It was here that he developed the FG01 vehicle, originally designed by Sergio Rinland, which gained seventh place at the Australian GP driven by Diniz. This was Stirano’s last race in a Formula 1 pit box. That following winter together with the help of Chris Radage, Stirano designed the Forti FG 03, a much more modern and lighter vehicle. Unfortunately, they never got around to building it due to the economic crisis which led to Forti eventually going bankrupt in 1996.In 1999 he worked together with the members of Euroteam in the STW championship with Stefano Modena’s Alfa Romeo 156.From 2002 to 2005 Stirano was the consultant of the race team Opel Euroteam (OPC Opel DTM team), managing the races of the Opel Astra of Jeroen Bleekemolen and Laurent Aiello. In the same period he was also providing technical assistance with the creation of Gloria, a company founded by Enrico Glorioso and specializing in the building of racing cars for Junior Championships. In 2006 Stirano founded the company, Albatech Monaco, an atelier of design and engineering providing consultancy in the automotive and nautical fieldsStirano was for a long time a member of ACI CSAI, the Italian racing cars Federation, in the Technical Subcommittee and, as Italian Deputy Member, in the FIA Technical Commission, President of the Motorsport Safety Council until 2006, and Advisor SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) for Italy from 1993 to 2000.He is currently involved as commentator and news analyst for television programs regarding the world of racing.Since 2001 he has been co-author for the Formula 1 yearbook published by Vallardi Editore. In 2003, together with Michael Ling, he edited the yearbook Formula 1 Championship 2003 Yearbook: The Complete Record of the Grand Prix Season. In 2006 together with Paolo D'Alessio and Mirco Lazzari, he published Formula 1 - La cronaca e le foto più belle del campionato, editing the technical part of the book. In 2007 Stirano and Paolo D’Alessio published the book [...] "Red Passion" [...] which speaks about the 60-year history of Ferrari races and in 2008 he and Paolo D’Alessio published the book “Gran Prix” which is about the ‘modern’ Formula 1.|$|R
5000|$|Brunton next {{introduced}} an electronic fluxgate compass imported from Taiwan, the Brunton Outback™, in 2000. The Outback had gimbal-mounted magnetic sensors which the manufacturer claimed allowed the unit to be tilted up to 15 degrees and still give accurate readings within its ultimate azimuth accuracy (plus or minus two degrees). The Outback stored up to 10 compass bearings in its memory, and featured a night navigation mode with illuminated arrows that warned if the user was moving off-track. The Outback was eventually {{replaced by the}} Brunton Nomad™ electronic compass. After complaints from owners about difficulties in calibrating the electronic compass feature and inaccurate bearings, the Nomad was discontinued in 2011. [...] In 2009, Brunton, Inc. was sold by Fiskars, Silva of Sweden's parent owner, and by the following year Brunton began to cease importing most Silva of Sweden compass products, including the Nexus and Elite lines {{as well as the}} Silva Model 54, a prismatic-sight baseplate compass relabeled as the Brunton 54LU™ for sale in North America. The Brunton 54LU was marketed to foresters, <b>surveyors,</b> geologists, SAR <b>teams,</b> and others as a precision navigation compass before being discontinued. [...] Some models that had formerly been imported from Sweden, including the Brunton 15TDCL and Brunton 16DLU, were later sourced from a production facility in China. In 2011, Brunton discontinued the Models 8010G, 8020, 8040G, 9020G, and 9030 compasses.|$|R
