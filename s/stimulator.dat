In mid-1993, Michael Schiavo requested a do not resuscitate order for her after she contracted a urinary tract infection.|$|E
5|$|The {{food supply}} of the country {{depended}} on cereals produced in southern Russia, while the Finns had specialized in milk and butter production. The cessation of the cereal imports from disintegrating Russia led to food shortages in Finland. The Senate responded by introducing rationing and price controls. The farmers opposed the state control; a black market with sharply rising food prices formed and export to free market of the Petrograd area increased. Food supply, prices, {{and in the end}} the fear of starvation became emotional political issues between farmers and industrial workers, in particular the unemployed ones. The common people, their fears exploited by the politicians and the political media, took to the streets. Despite the food shortages, no large-scale starvation hit southern Finland before the civil war and the food market remained a secondary <b>stimulator</b> in the power struggle of the Finnish state.|$|E

40|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of tissues is an increasingly valuable tool for treating {{a variety of}} disorders, with applications including cardiac pacemakers, cochlear implants, visual prostheses, deep brain <b>stimulators,</b> spinal cord <b>stimulators,</b> and muscle <b>stimulators.</b> Brain implants for paralysis treatments are increasingly providing sensory feedback via neural stimulation. Within the field of neuroscience, the perturbation of neuronal circuits wirelessly in untethered, freely-behaving animals is of particular importance. In implantable systems, power consumption is often the limiting factor in determining battery or power coil size, cost, and level of tissue heating, with stimulation circuitry typically dominating the power budget of the entire implant. Thus, there is strong motivation to improve the energy efficiency of implantable electrical <b>stimulators.</b> In this thesis, I present two examples of low-power tissue <b>stimulators.</b> The first type is a wireless, low-power neural stimulation system for use in freely behaving animals. The system consists of an external transmitter and a miniature, implantable wireless receiver-and-stimulator utilizing...|$|R

25|$|For supraclavicular block, nerve {{stimulation}} with a minimal threshold of 0.9 mA {{can offer a}} dependable block. Although ultrasound-guided supraclavicular block {{has been shown to}} be a safe alternative to the peripheral nerve <b>stimulator</b> guided technique, there is little evidence to support that ultrasound guidance provides a better block, or is associated with fewer complications. There is some evidence to suggest that the use of ultrasound guidance in combination with {{nerve stimulation}} can shorten the performance time of supraclavicular block.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the interscalene block — {{which results}} in diaphragmatic {{hemiparesis}} in all subjects — only half of those who undergo supraclavicular block experience this side effect. Disadvantages of the supraclavicular block include the risk of pneumothorax, which {{is estimated to be}} between 1%4% when using paresthesia or peripheral nerve <b>stimulator</b> guided techniques. Ultrasound guidance allows the operator to visualize the first rib and the pleura, thereby helping to ensure that the needle does not puncture the pleura; this presumably reduces the risk of pneumothorax.|$|E

25|$|The lumbar plexus {{block is}} an {{advanced}} technique indicated for hip, anterior thigh, and knee surgery. The lumbar plexus {{is composed of}} nerves originating from L1 to L4 spinal roots such as the iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, genitofemoral, lateral femoral cutaneous, femoral, and obturator nerves. Since the plexus is located deep, there is {{an increased risk of}} local anesthetic toxicity, so less toxic anesthetics like chloroprocaine or mepivacaine mixed with ropivacaine are often recommended. A curvilinear ultrasound probe can be used but {{it is often difficult to}} see the plexus, so a nerve <b>stimulator</b> is used to locate it.|$|E

25|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) has been {{demonstrated}} {{to be a major}} contributor to angiogenesis, increasing the number of capillaries in a given network. Initial in vitro studies demonstrated bovine capillary endothelial cells will proliferate and show signs of tube structures upon stimulation by VEGF and bFGF, although the results were more pronounced with VEGF. Upregulation of VEGF is a major component of the physiological response to exercise and its role in angiogenesis is suspected to be a possible treatment in vascular injuries. In vitro studies clearly demonstrate that VEGF is a potent <b>stimulator</b> of angiogenesis because, in the presence of this growth factor, plated endothelial cells will proliferate and migrate, eventually forming tube structures resembling capillaries.|$|E
25|$|Surface {{landmarks}} {{can be used}} {{to identify}} the appropriate location for injection of local anesthetic, which is typically lateral to (outside) the lateral border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and above the clavicle, with the first rib generally considered to represent the limit below which the needle must not be directed (the pleural cavity and uppermost part of the lung are located at this level). Palpation or ultrasound visualization of the subclavian artery just above the clavicle provides a useful anatomic landmark for locating the brachial plexus, which is lateral to the artery at this level. Proximity to the brachial plexus can be determined using by elicitation of a paresthesia, use of a peripheral nerve <b>stimulator,</b> or ultrasound guidance.|$|E
25|$|Disadvantages of the {{axillary}} block include inadequate anesthesia in {{the distribution}} of the musculocutaneous nerve. This nerve supplies motor function to the biceps, brachialis, and coracobrachialis muscles and one of its branches supplies sensation to the skin of the forearm. If the musculocutaneous nerve is missed, {{it may be necessary to}} block this nerve separately. This can be accomplished by using a peripheral nerve <b>stimulator</b> to identify the location of the nerve as it passes through the coracobrachialis muscle. The intercostobrachial nerves (which are branches of the second and third intercostal nerves) are also frequently missed with the axillary block. Because these nerves supply sensation to the skin of the medial and posterior aspects of the arm and axilla, a tourniquet on the arm may be poorly tolerated in such cases. Subcutaneous injection of local anesthetic over the medial aspect of the arm in the axilla helps patients tolerate an arm tourniquet by blocking these nerves.|$|E
