50|$|With the Gripen {{contract}} due {{to expire}} in 2015, speculation mounted about whether that leasing agreement will be renewed or {{another type of}} fighter plane chosen. The Czech government expected a tender to be organised to provide a force of 18 supersonic fighters after 2015. The JAS-39 Gripen was generally accepted as the most effective option owing to the existing infrastructure, the availability of trained personnel and previous good operational experience. However, {{the background of the}} existing contract - specifically the broadly discussed issue of alleged corruption - prevented politicians from settling for this quick solution, favouring instead a general tender with more bidders offering such types as the F-16, F/A-18, F-15SE or F-35A.The creation of a non-supersonic air force has also been discussed as an option, owing to the perceived high costs and limited usefulness of keeping supersonic assets in a country surrounded by allied countries (all are European Union members and NATO members, except Austria). In this scenario the subsonic L-159 would become the backbone of the air force. The latest 2011 White Book clearly states that the <b>supersonic</b> <b>fleet</b> is to be continued {{for the protection of the}} Czech Republic and for co-operation within the NATO Integrated Air Defence System. On the other hand, a number of close support helicopters Mi-24/35 will be decommissioned (the Mi-35 will even be sold before the end of its operational life). Twelve single-seat and two twin-seat aircraft are viewed as sufficient for patrolling the Czech Republic, while 18 can support the sentry role in other NATO countries. A preliminary RFI requested 18 aircraft. The White Book specifies the 12+2 solution, requiring strategic requirements for the supersonic air force to be specified by November 2011.|$|E
40|$|The input {{for global}} {{atmospheric}} chemistry models was generated for baseline High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) configurations at Mach 1. 6, 2. 2, and 3. 2. The input is supplied {{in the form}} of number of molecules of specific exhaust constituents injected into the atmosphere per year by latitude and by altitude (for 2 -D codes). Seven exhaust constituents are currently supplied: NO, NO 2, CO, CO 2, H 2 O, SO 2, and THC (Trace Hydrocarbons). An eighth input is also supplied, NO(x), the sum of NO and NO 2. The number of molecules of a given constituent emitted per year {{is a function of the}} total fuel burned by a <b>supersonic</b> <b>fleet</b> and the emission index (EI) of the aircraft engine for the constituent in question. The EIs for an engine are supplied directly by the engine manufacturers. The annual fuel burn of a <b>supersonic</b> <b>fleet</b> is calculated from aircraft performance and economic criteria, both of which are strongly dependent on basic design parameters such as speed and range.

40|$|Pole-to-pole {{variability}} of soot aerosol from subsonic aircraft {{is evidence of}} two important aspects of stratospheric transport. Vertical transport to 20 km pressure altitude from flight levels near 10 - 12 km cannot be explained by isentropic mixing. Instead, lofting in the tropics is a possibility. A strong meridional gradient implies that stratospheric soot aerosol residence time is shorter than are mixing times between the hemispheres. Therefore, little if any of exhaust constituents (with residence times {{similar to that of}} aircraft soot aerosol), emitted in heavily traveled flight corridors in northern mid-latitudes by a future <b>supersonic</b> <b>fleet,</b> would be transported to the southern hemisphere. However, a significant fraction of NOx could be lofted to altitudes above flight levels where it would dominate ozone depletion...|$|E

Based on characteristic aircraft parameters, which were developed within the EU-project HISAC, emissions along geographically representative trajectories are calculated {{and in addition}} the resulting changes in the atmospheric composition (carbon dioxide, ozone layer, water vapour) and climate (near surface global mean temperature) are deduced. We assume a fleet development with an entry in service in 2015, a full fleet in 2050. The results show a temperature increase of 0 · 08 mK (0 · 07 - 0 · 10 mK) with only small but statistically significant variations between the configurations, leading to a minimum climate impact for a weight optimised and hence lower flying aircraft. A climate impact ratio of 3 · 0 ± 0 · 4 between a S 4 TA and its subsonic counterpart is calculated, which is considerable less than for previous <b>supersonic</b> <b>fleets</b> because of a lower flight altitude, leading to smaller water vapour impacts...|$|R

40|$|The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was jointly {{established}} by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in 1988 to: (i) assess available information on the science, the impacts, and the economics of, and the options for mitigating and/or adapting to, climate change and (ii) provide, on request, scientific/technical/socio-economic advice to the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

A number of sensitivity studies are analysed to identify options to minimise climate impact.

In order to include climate aspects in multi-disciplinary optimisation for supersonics an assessment tool (AirClim) has been developed within the EU Integrated Project HISAC, which is briefly presented. The main atmospheric input data describe the atmosphere’s sensitivity to the emission region.

The eruptions of volcanos Ruiz and Kelut ejected at least 5. 6 x 10 (exp 5) and 1. 8 x 10 (exp 5) tons of materials into the stratosphere, respectively.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} a {{challenge}} to society and to cope with requires assessment tools which are suitable to evaluate new technology options with respect to their impact on global climate. Here we present AirClim, a model which comprises a linearisation of atmospheric processes from the emission to radiative forcing, resulting in an estimate in near surface temperature change, which is presumed to be a reasonable indicator for climate change. The model is designed to be applicable to aircraft technology, i. e. the climate agents CO 2, H 2 O, CH 4 and O 3 (latter two resulting from NO x -emissions) and contrails are taken into account. AirClim combines a number of precalculated atmospheric data with aircraft emission data to obtain the temporal evolution of atmospheric concentration changes, radiative forcing and temperature changes. These precalculated data are derived from 25 steady-state simulations for the year 2050 with the climate-chemistry model E 39 /C, prescribing normalised emissions of nitrogen oxides and water vapour at various atmospheric regions. The results show that strongest climate impacts (year 2100) from ozone changes occur for emissions in the tropical upper troposphere (60 mW/m 2; 80 mK for 1 TgN/year emitted) and from methane changes from emissions in the middle tropical troposphere (− 2. 7 % change in methane lifetime; – 30 mK per TgN/year). For short-lived species (e. g. ozone, water vapour, methane) individual perturbation lifetimes are derived depending on the region of emission. A comparison of this linearisation approach with results from a comprehensive climate-chemistry model shows reasonable agreement with respect to concentration changes, radiative forcing, and temperature changes. For example, the total impact of a <b>supersonic</b> <b>fleet</b> on radiative forcing (mainly water vapour) is reproduced within 10 %. A wide range of application is demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|To {{predict the}} {{environmental}} impacts of future commercial aviation, intensive studies have been launched to measure the properties and effects of aircraft emissions. These observations have revealed an extremely wide variance with respect to the number and sizes of the particles produced in the exhaust plumes. Aircraft aerosol ultimately contributes to the population of cloud-forming nuclei, and may lead to significant global radiative and chemical perturbations. In this paper, recent discoveries are coordinated and unified {{in the form of a}} physically consistent plume aerosol model that explains most of the observational variance. Using this new approach, it is now practical to carry out reliable global atmospheric simulations of aircraft effects, as demonstrated by a novel assessment of the perturbation of the stratospheric aerosol layer by a <b>supersonic</b> aircraft <b>fleet.</b> (orig.) 31 refs.

The sources are assumed to operate continuously and at a uniform rate for periods of many years. It is found that transport by meridional winds and by eddy processes acts to diminish the corridor effect by advecting the pollutants out of the region of injection and by mixing them with the ambient air. Attention is given to the altitude for which a detectable corridor effect can be expected for the hypothetical launching of 400 HLLV's per year for 10 years...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{demand for}} {{intercontinental}} transportation is increasing {{and people are}} requesting short travel times, which supersonic air transportation would enable. However, besides noise and sonic boom issues, which we are not referring to in this investigation, emissions from supersonic aircraft are known to alter the atmospheric composition, in particular the ozone layer, and hence affect climate significantly more than subsonic aircraft. Here, we suggest a metric to quantitatively assess different options for supersonic transport {{with regard to the}} potential destruction of the ozone layer and climate impacts. Options for fleet size, engine technology (nitrogen oxide emission level), cruising speed, range, and cruising altitude, are analyzed, based on SCENIC emission scenarios for 2050, which underlay the requirements to be as realistic as possible in terms of e. g., economic markets and profitable market penetration. This methodology is based on a number of atmosphere-chemistry and climate models to reduce model dependencies. The model results differ significantly in terms of the response to a replacement of subsonic aircraft by supersonic aircraft, e. g., concerning the ozone impact. However, model differences are smaller when comparing the different options for a <b>supersonic</b> <b>fleet.</b> Those uncertainties were taken into account {{to make sure that our}} findings are robust. The base case scenario, where supersonic aircraft get in service in 2015, a first fleet fully operational in 2025 and a second in 2050, leads in our simulations to a near surface temperature increase in 2050 of around 7 mK and with constant emissions afterwards to around 21 mK in 2100. The related total radiative forcing amounts to 22 mWm 2 in 2050, with an uncertainty between 9 and 29 mWm 2. A reduced supersonic cruise altitude or speed (from Mach 2 to Mach 1. 6) reduces both, climate impact and ozone destruction, by around 40 %.

Encounters with the exhaust plume occurred approximately 10 min after emission with spatial scales near 2 km and durations of up to 10 s. Measurements include total reactive nitrogen, NO(y), the component species NO and NO 2, CO 2, H 2 O, CO, N 2 O, condensation nuclei, and meteorological parameters. The integrated amounts of CO 2 and H 2 O during the encounters are consistent with the stoichiometry of fuel combustion (1 : 1 molar). Emission indices (EI) for NO(x) (= NO + NO 2), CO, and N 2 O are calculated using simultaneous measurements of CO 2. EI values for NO(x) near 4 g/(kg fuel) are in good agreement with values scaled from limited ground-based tests of the ER- 2 engine. Non-NO(x) species comprise less than about 20 % of emitted reactive nitrogen, consistent with model evaluations.

40|$|Interest in the {{distribution}} of black carbon (soot) aerosol (BCA) in the atmosphere is warranted for the following reasons: (1) BCA has the highest absorption cross section of any compound known, thus it can absorb solar radiation to cause atmospheric warming; (2) BCA is a strong adsorber of gases, thus it can catalyze heterogeneous chemical reactions to modify the chemical composition of the atmosphere; (3) If aircraft emission is the major source of atmospheric BCA, it can serve as an atmospheric tracer of aircraft exhaust. We collect BCA particles {{greater than or equal to}} 0. 02 micrometer diameter by wires mounted on both the DC- 8 and ER- 2 aircraft. After return to the laboratory, the wires are examined with a field emission scanning electron microscope to identify BCA particles by their characteristic morphology. Typically, BCA exists in the atmosphere as small particles of complex morphology. The particle sizes at the source are measured in tens of Angstrom units; after a short residence time in the atmosphere, individual particles coalesce to loosely packed agglomerates of typical dimensions 0. 01 to 0. 1 micrometer. We approximate the size of each BCA aggregate by that of a sphere of equivalent volume. This is done by computing the volume of a sphere whose diameter is the mean between averaged minimum and maximum dimensions of the BCA particle. While this procedure probably underestimates the actual surface area, it permits us to compare BCA size distributions among themselves and with other types of aerosols. When statistically justified, we fit lognormal distributions to the data points to determine number concentrations, geometric mean radii, standard deviations, BCA surface areas and volumes. Results to date permit the following conclusions: (1) BCA concentration in the northern stratosphere averages 0. 6 ng per cubic meters. This amount is one part in 10 (exp 4) after a volcanic eruption (e. g., Pinatubo) increasing to about one percent during volcanic quiescence. In the northern troposphere, BCA concentration averages 3. 2 ng per cubic meters, or 0. 3 percent of the background aerosol. (2) Applying an BCA emission index EI(BCA) = 5 x 10 (exp - 5), measured in the exhaust wake of a Concorde supersonic jet aircraft, to realistic estimates of fuel burnt by the current and projected fleets permits us to conclude that: (i) Most BCA in the northern stratosphere results from aircraft emissions; (ii) Most BCA in the northern troposphere results from other sources than aircraft; (iii) A projected <b>supersonic</b> <b>fleet</b> will increase the northern stratospheric BCA concentration by one order of magnitude, unless the emission index is substantially reduced. (3) A strong gradient between the northern and southern hemispheres indicates that mixing across the equator is greatly inhibited in relation to atmospheric residence times of BCA.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of black carbon (soot) aerosol (BCA) {{in the atmosphere}} is of interest for several reasons: (1) Because BCA has the highest absorption cross section of any compound known, it can absorb solar radiation to cause atmospheric warming. (2) Because it is a strong adsorber of gases, it can catalyze heterogeneous reactions to change the chemical composition of the atmosphere. (3) If aircraft are {{a major source of}} BCA, it is an important tracer of aircraft emissions. Analysis for BCA of impactor samples from Arctic and Antarctic deployments, utilizing particle morphology of scanning electron microscopy images, permits the following conclusions: (1) The BCA concentration in the northern stratosphere varies between 0 and 2. 6 ng m- 3 averaging 0. 6 ng/cu m. (2) This BCA loading is commensurate with estimated fuel consumptions in the stratosphere by the current commercial fleet and an emission index E= 0. 03 g BCA per kg fuel burnt which was measured in jet exhaust at al titude. Thus, most stratospheric BCA in the northern stratosphere results from aircraft emissions. The background BCA concentration in the southern stratosphere varies between 0 and 0. 6 ng cu m averaging 0. 1 ng/cu m. This strong meridional gradient implies that stratospheric BCA residence time- is shorter than are mixing times between hemispheres. Projected annual fuel consumption of a future <b>supersonic</b> commercial <b>fleet</b> is 7 E 13 g.
