She says the AV [...] "has a different atmosphere. It's not very sophisticated, in fact it's primitive. It's a bit like eating and menus in restaurants: you're hungry {{and you have a}} sudden craving for noodles, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> and eat noodles. Your appetite is towards a porno video, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> and rent whatever turns you on. And as with food, viewers can use basic ingredients to 'cook' the desired stimulation from the video themselves." ...|$|E

They were later moved to the Archaeological museum in the capital where they are to be conserved and studied. It is intended that they will ultimately be returned to the City Museum in Vinkovci where they will be put on permanent display, possibly in a new building dedicated for that purpose. According to the museum's Hrvoje VuliÄ‡, [...] "This will be our kind of Mona Lisa. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> to the Louvre to see the Mona Lisa, but then you look at everything else.
