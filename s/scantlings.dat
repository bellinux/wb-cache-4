5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called hatch cover. In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the hatches, and these areas must be reinforced. Often, hatch areas are reinforced by locally increasing the <b>scantlings</b> or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|E

25|$|The Flower class {{became an}} {{essential}} resource for North Atlantic convoy protection until larger vessels such as destroyer escorts and frigates could {{be produced in}} sufficient quantities. The simple design of the Flower class using parts and techniques (<b>scantlings)</b> common to merchant shipping meant they could be constructed in small commercial shipyards all over the United Kingdom and eastern Canada, where larger (or more sophisticated) warships could not be built. Additionally, the use of commercial triple expansion machinery instead of steam turbines meant the largely Royal Naval Reserve and Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve crews that were manning the corvettes would be familiar with their operation.|$|E

500|$|Brenton was {{promoted}} to post-captain, and in March1800 Commander Lord Cochrane took over. Cochrane was less than impressed with his new command, declaring that Speedy was [...] "little more than a burlesque of a vessel of war". His cabin had only [...] of headroom; when Cochrane wished to shave he had to open a skylight and set his shaving equipment out on the quarterdeck. On another occasion he walked the quarterdeck with Speedys entire broadside, seven pieces of four-pounder shot, in his pockets. In an attempt to increase the firepower of his new command he asked for and was given two 12-pounder long guns to use as bow and stern chasers, but the <b>scantlings</b> could not support them {{and they had to}} be removed. He then requested his 4-pounders be upgraded to 6-pounders, but his gunports were not big enough. He had better luck with his mast, taking a spar from HMS Genereux that was considered too large for Speedy, but which Cochrane felt improved her speed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most common}} type of keel is the [...] "flat plate keel", and this is fitted in the {{majority}} of ocean-going ships and other vessels. A form of keel found on smaller vessels is the [...] "bar keel", which may be fitted in trawlers, tugs, and smaller ferries. Where grounding is possible, this type of keel is suitable with its massive <b>scantlings,</b> but there is always a problem of the increased draft with no additional cargo capacity. If a double bottom is fitted, the keel is almost inevitably of the flat plate type, bar keels often being associated with open floors, where the plate keel may also be fitted.|$|E
2500|$|Boadicea {{was one of}} a {{batch of}} large frigates ordered in 1795, all of which were the largest of their type, and the {{majority}} of which were to the draught of captured French ships, the Navy then being under the sway of Middleton and the French school of thought, a school supposing that the design of warships in France was of a higher quality. She was built to the design of Imperieuse, a 40-gun ship completed in 1787 and captured in October 1793. [...] Changes were made to the shape of the topsides, and the <b>scantlings</b> and fastenings were strengthened to reflect British practice. She retained her shallow French hull form, and as a result the holds and magazines were considered cramped.|$|E
6000|$|I {{then took}} up three planks from the {{flooring}} of the chamber, and deposited all between the <b>scantlings.</b> I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye--not even his--could have detected any thing wrong.

60|$|Suddenly, {{glancing up}} at the dim cloud of sails above, I saw that we were aback and making sternway. We might have tossed a biscuit aboard the big Serapis as she glided ahead of us. The broadsides thundered, and great ragged <b>scantlings</b> brake from our bulwarks and flew {{as high as the}} mizzen-top; and the shrieks and groans redoubled. Involuntarily my eyes sought the poop, and I gave a sigh of relief {{at the sight of the}} {{commanding}} figure in the midst of the whirling smoke. We shotted our guns with double-headed, manned our lee braces, and gathered headway.|$|E
60|$|The man wormed to {{the edge}} of the couch, and slipped off to the floor on his knees. By means of a chair he drew himself to his feet. Still {{clinging}} to the chair, supporting most of his weight on it, he shoved it to the door and out upon the veranda. The sweat from the exertion streamed down his face and showed through the undershirt across his shoulders. He managed to get into the chair, where he panted in a state of collapse. In a few minutes he roused himself. The boy held the end of the telescope against one of the veranda <b>scantlings,</b> while the man gazed through it at the sea. At last he picked up the white sails of the schooner and studied them.|$|E
6000|$|Michel Voss said no {{word about}} Adrian Urmand {{as they were}} {{ascending}} the hill. He was too wise for that. He could not have given effect to his experience with sufficient eloquence had he attempted the task while {{the burden of the}} rising ground was upon his lungs and chest. They turned into a saw-mill as they went up, and counted the <b>scantlings</b> of timber that had been cut; and Michel looked at the cradle to see that it worked well, and to the wheels to see that they were in good order, and observed that the channel for the water required repairs, and said a word as to the injury that had come to him because George had left him. 'Perhaps he may come back soon,' said Marie. To this he made no answer, but continued his path up the mountain-side. 'There will be plenty of feed for the cows this autumn,' said Marie Bromar. 'That is a great comfort.' ...|$|E
60|$|There rose one {{of those}} {{universal}} shrieks of wild passion which announce that men have discarded all the trammels of civilization, and found in their licentious rage new and unforseen sources of power and vengeance. Where it came from, how it was obtained, who prompted the thought, who first accomplished it, were alike impossible to trace; but as it were in a moment, a number of trusses of straw were piled up before the house and set on fire, {{the gates of the}} timber-yard were forced, and a quantity of <b>scantlings</b> and battens soon fed the flame. Everything indeed that could stimulate the fire was employed; and every one was occupied in the service. They ran to the water side and plundered the barges, and threw the huge blocks of coal upon the enormous bonfire. Men, women, and children were alike at work with the eagerness and energy of fiends. The roof of the house caught fire: the dwelling burned rapidly; you could see the flames like the tongues of wild beasts, licking the bare and vanishing walls; a single being was observed amid the fiery havoc, shrieking and desperate he clung convulsively to a huge account book, It was Master Joseph. His father had made his escape {{from the back of the}} premises and had counselled his son instantly to follow him, but Master Joseph wished to rescue the ledger as well as their lives, and the delay ruined him.|$|E
60|$|About {{two hundred}} yards off, in the flat, we built a pen of <b>scantlings,</b> about four feet high, and laid planks on it, and so made a platform. We covered it with swell {{tapestries}} borrowed for the occasion, and topped it off with the abbot's own throne. When {{you are going to}} do a miracle for an ignorant race, you want to get in every detail that will count; you want to make all the properties impressive to the public eye; you want to make matters comfortable for your head guest; then you can turn yourself loose and play your effects for all they are worth. I know the value of these things, for I know human nature. You can't throw too much style into a miracle. It costs trouble, and work, and sometimes money; but it pays in the end. Well, we brought the wires to the ground at the chapel, and then brought them under the ground to the platform, and hid the batteries there. We put a rope fence a hundred feet square around the platform to keep off the common multitude, and that finished the work. My idea was, doors open at 10:30, performance to begin at 11:25 sharp. I wished I could charge admission, but of course that wouldn't answer. I instructed my boys to be in the chapel as early as 10, before anybody was around, and be ready to man the pumps at the proper time, and make the fur fly. Then we went home to supper.|$|E
6000|$|And besides all this, {{is there}} nothing in dark providences, {{for the sake}} of the sight and {{observation}} of which, such a day may be rendered lovely, when it is upon us? Is there nothing of God, of his wisdom and power and goodness to be seen in thunder, and lightning, in hailstones? in storms? and darkness and tempests? Why then is it said, he [...] "hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm" [...] (Nahum 1:3). And why have God's servants of old made such notes, and observed from them such excellent and wonderful things. There is that of God to be seen in such a day as cannot be seen in another. His power in holding up some, his wrath in leaving of others; his making of shrubs to stand, and his suffering of cedars to fall; his infatuating of the counsels of men, and his making of the devil to outwit himself; his giving of his presence to his people, and his leaving of his foes in the dark; his discovering the uprightness of the hearts of his sanctified ones, and laying open the hypocrisy of others, is a working of spiritual wonders in the day of his wrath, and of the whirlwind and storm. These days! these days are the days that do most aptly give an occasion to Christians, of any, to take the exactest measures and <b>scantlings</b> of ourselves. We are apt to overshoot, in days that are calm, and to think ourselves far higher, and more strong than we find we be, when the trying day is upon us. The mouth of Gaal and the boasts of Peter were great and high before the trial came, but when that came, they found themselves to fall far short of the courage they thought they had (Judg 9:38). We also, before the temptation comes, think we can walk upon the sea, but when the winds blow, we feel ourselves begin to sink. Hence such a time is rightly said to be a time to try us, or to find out what we are, and is there no good in this? Is it not this that rightly rectifies our judgment about ourselves, that makes us to know ourselves, that tends to cut off those superfluous sprigs of pride and self-conceitedness, wherewith we are subject to be overcome? Is not such a day, the day that bends us, humbleth us, and that makes us bow before God, for our faults committed in our prosperity? and yet doth it yield no good unto us? we cold not live without such turnings of the hand of God upon us. We should be overgrown with flesh, if we had not our seasonable winters. It is said that in some countries trees will grow, but will bear no fruit, because there is no winter there. The Lord bless all seasons to his people, and help them rightly to behave themselves, under all the times that go over them. Farewell. I am thine to serve thee in the gospel, JOHN BUNYAN.|$|E
