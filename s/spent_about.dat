5|$|Between 1907 and 1918, Best and Holt had <b>spent</b> <b>about</b> US$1.5 {{million in}} legal fees {{fighting}} each other. The two companies competed economically and intellectually: Benjamin Holt had 47 patents in his name, while his nephew Pliny Holt had 38 patents; Best founder Daniel Best received 42 patents and his son C.L.Best had 27 patents.|$|E
5|$|Financial {{donations}} {{were also}} an issue. Bloomberg and Broad donated $350,000 and $250,000, respectively, {{to support the}} Senators. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee also spent $250,000 to oppose recall. The NRA spent over $108,000 to support the recall efforts. In total, the Morse and Giron side spent approximately $3,000,000 opposing the recall, while the recall supporters <b>spent</b> <b>about</b> $500,000.|$|E
5|$|Wills {{states that}} Rutherford seemed to relish his {{descriptions}} of how completely the wicked {{would be destroyed}} at Armageddon, dwelling at great length on prophecies of destruction.

5|$|With the win, Connecticut {{finished}} {{the season with}} a final record of 8–5; South Carolina fell to 7–6. Financially, both teams roughly broke even on the game: the Huskies were given an expense allowance of about $1.2million from the Big East and spent just over $1million, while the Gamecocks received just under $1million from the SEC and <b>spent</b> <b>about</b> $900,000.|$|E
5|$|A major Brundage {{investment}} was Chicago's La Salle Hotel, {{which had been}} built in 1908. Located {{in the heart of}} The Loop and the city's financial district, Brundage first leased it in 1940, later purchasing it. When the hotel was seriously damaged by fire in 1946, Brundage <b>spent</b> <b>about</b> $2.5 million remodeling and modernizing it. As Brundage made a home there during his time as IOC president, the hotel became famous in international sports as his residence. He sold the hotel in 1970, but later reclaimed it when the purchaser failed to make required payments.|$|E
5|$|Both the Holt Manufacturing Company and C.L.Best {{were hurt}} by the {{depression}} of 1920–21 which further inhibited sales. Both companies streamlined their over-lapping product lines. The two companies had <b>spent</b> <b>about</b> US$1.5 million (about $ today) in legal fees fighting each other in various contractual, trademark and patent infringement lawsuits since 1905, but, {{on the advice of}} investors, the two companies merged in 1925 to form the Caterpillar Tractor Co. , Caterpillar Inc. was the 229th largest company in the world.|$|E
50|$|The {{closed-loop}} hybrid wind/hydro {{system is}} expected to save approximately US$4M per year (calculated with January 2011 oil prices) previously <b>spent</b> on <b>about</b> 40,000 barrels of crude oil imported annually, attempting to make the island completely self-sufficient for electrical energy.|$|R

5|$|George mainly {{lived in}} Great Britain after 1714 though he visited {{his home in}} Hanover in 1716, 1719, 1720, 1723 and 1725; in total George <b>spent</b> <b>about</b> one fifth of his reign as King in Germany. A clause in the Act of Settlement that forbade the British monarch from leaving the country without Parliament's {{permission}} was unanimously repealed in 1716. During all but {{the first of the}} King's absences power was vested in a Regency Council rather than his son, George Augustus, Prince of Wales.|$|E
5|$|In late 1910, she {{sailed to}} Europe {{as part of}} Atlantic Fleet maneuvers, {{following}} which she <b>spent</b> <b>about</b> 14 months off the Atlantic coast, based alternately in Philadelphia and Norfolk, serving as a training ship and conducting operational exercises. In June 1912, she landed a Marine detachment at El Cuero, Cuba, to protect American interests. Following exercises with the fleet, she returned to Philadelphia Navy Yard, where she was put in the First Reserve in August 1912.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{returned}} to Normandy in 1125 and <b>spent</b> <b>about</b> {{a year at}} the royal court, where her father Henry was still hoping that his second marriage would generate a male heir. In the event that this might fail to happen, Matilda was now Henry's preferred choice, and he declared that she was to be his rightful successor if he should die without a male heir. The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore in January to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have.|$|E
50|$|As a teenager, {{beginning}} in 1966, Roger’s summers were <b>spent</b> learning <b>about</b> construction as a labourer, {{on the business}} end of a shovel, graduating to tractors and bulldozers. In 1971, he began a career with his father's company, North American Road, later becoming North American Construction Group (NACG).|$|R
50|$|In October of {{that same}} year, the Bishop Museum was criticized for having raised $600,000 to {{preserve}} the ship, and <b>spent</b> only <b>about</b> half that on the ship, and that for sandblasting that was determined to damage {{the integrity of the}} vessel. The media also pointed out other questionable spending decisions.|$|R

5|$|On 15 October 1944 a train {{carrying}} 700 men on Schindler's {{list was}} initially {{sent to the}} concentration camp at Gross-Rosen, where the men <b>spent</b> <b>about</b> a week before being re-routed to the factory in Brünnlitz. Three hundred female Schindlerjuden were similarly sent to Auschwitz, where they were in imminent danger of {{being sent to the}} gas chambers. Schindler's usual connections and bribes failed to obtain their release. Finally after he sent his secretary, Hilde Albrecht, with bribes of black market goods, food and diamonds, the women were sent to Brünnlitz after several harrowing weeks in Auschwitz.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before leaving}} the case, Dompig gave an {{interview}} to CBS in which he stated that he believed Holloway probably died from alcohol and/or drug poisoning, was not murdered, and that someone later hid her body. Dompig also stated that Aruba had <b>spent</b> <b>about</b> $3million on the investigation, which was about 40% of the police operational budget. Dompig {{indicated that there was}} evidence that pointed to possession (though not necessarily use) of illicit drugs by Holloway. Members of Holloway's family have denied that she used drugs.|$|E
5|$|The University of Bahrain {{had over}} 20,000 {{students}} in 2014, 65% {{of whom are}} women, and around 900 faculty members, 40% of whom are women. From 1986 to 2014, university staff published 5 500 papers and books. The university <b>spent</b> <b>about</b> US$11 million per year on research in 2014, which was conducted by a contingent of 172 men and 128 women. Women thus made up 43% of researchers at the University of Bahrain in 2014.|$|E
60|$|The {{night that}} Armand St. Just <b>spent</b> tossing <b>about</b> on a hard, narrow bed {{was the most}} miserable, agonising one he had ever passed in his life. A kind of fever ran through him, causing his teeth to chatter and the veins in his temples to throb until he thought that they must burst.|$|R
5000|$|Cook [...] "continued {{to spend}} up large on {{plants in the}} 1930s, {{far more than the}} farm earned. In 1936, he <b>spent</b> £85 (<b>about</b> a working man's wages for half a year) at one New Plymouth nursery alone and, {{by the end of his}} life, he had spent on average £1000 {{annually}} on plants from overseas and New Zealand".|$|R
5000|$|Later smaller {{impacts on}} these near-Earth objects {{dislodged}} rock-sized meteorites, {{some of which}} later struck Earth. On the basis of cosmic ray exposure measurements, {{it is thought that}} most HED meteorites arose from several distinct impact events of this kind, and <b>spent</b> from <b>about</b> 6 million to 73 million years in space before striking the Earth.|$|R
5|$|When {{the film}} was released, Landis, Widdoes and Allen went on a {{national}} promotional tour. Universal Pictures <b>spent</b> <b>about</b> $4.5 million promoting the film at selected college campuses and helped students organize their own toga parties. One such party at the University of Maryland attracted some 2,000 people, while students at the University of Wisconsin–Madison tried for a crowd of 10,000 people and {{a place in the}} Guinness Book of World Records. Thanks to the film, toga parties became one of the favorite college campus happenings during 1978 and 1979.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle (384–322 BC) {{studied at}} Plato's Academy in Athens, {{remaining}} {{there for about}} 20 years. Like Plato, he sought universals in his philosophy, but unlike Plato he backed up his views with detailed and systematic observation, notably of {{the natural history of}} the island of Lesbos, where he <b>spent</b> <b>about</b> two years, and the marine life in the seas around it, especially of the Pyrrha lagoon in the island's centre. This study made him the earliest scientist whose written work survives. No similarly detailed work on zoology was attempted until the sixteenth century; accordingly Aristotle remained highly influential for some two thousand years. He returned to Athens and founded his own school, the Lycaeum, where he taught for the last dozen years of his life. His writings on zoology form about a quarter of his surviving work. Aristotle's pupil Theophrastus later wrote a similar book on botany, Enquiry into Plants.|$|E
5|$|By 2000 the City of Portland had <b>spent</b> <b>about</b> $200million {{to nearly}} {{eliminate}} CSOs {{from entering the}} slough. It also replaced septic tank and cesspool systems near {{the middle and upper}} slough with sanitary sewers. BES analysis of water samples taken between 1995 and 2002 showed {{that by the end of}} this period DEQ water quality standards for Escherichia coli, the indicator organism for fecal contamination, were nearly always being met in the upper and middle sloughs and generally being met in the lower slough. Despite these and other improvements in water quality, the slough is not a safe source of edible fish. The Multnomah County Health Department and other agencies have advised people to avoid or greatly reduce consumption of fish and crayfish from the slough because they contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and pesticides.|$|E

"Explored, {{exposed and}} {{cherished}} {{if not by}} each other than at least, unmistakably, by their author, these creatures wrench their vanished time and place into the modern mind with such force as to displace everything else -- not only during the hours and days <b>spent</b> reading <b>about</b> them, but in their interstices and the aftermath as well."

5|$|Coghill met Powderfinger when he {{attended}} {{one of their}} practice sessions and joked with the band, introducing himself as a drummer. Two years later, when Steven Bishop left the band, guitarist Ian Haug recognised Coghill at an audition, and signed him at that point. Previously, Coghill had been rejected in an audition for Custard. Jon <b>spent</b> <b>about</b> six months playing alongside Scott Coleman and Marc Zande in the Brisbane grunge band, Gland, before committing full-time to Powderfinger in early 1992. In December 1997, Coghill took a brief break from Powderfinger and toured with Regurgitator. Drummer Ross McLennan of Far Out Corporation and later from The Predators, took Coghill's place for a Powderfinger performance on 19 December.|$|E
5|$|General Sheridan now led an 8,000-man force, and it {{consisted}} of two cavalry divisions. General Wesley Merritt was Sheridan's cavalry commander. General Thomas Devin led the 1st Division, and the 3rd Division was commanded by George Armstrong Custer, who was now a general. The 2nd West Virginia Cavalry {{became part of the}} 3rd Brigade, 3rd Division Cavalry Corps. The brigade consisted of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd West Virginia Cavalry regiments, and was commanded by Colonel Henry Capehart. The divisions <b>spent</b> <b>about</b> six weeks in winter quarters, where they rested and were given fresh clothing. On February 27, they left Winchester and moved south. Their purpose was to eliminate Jubal Early's Confederate army.|$|E
5|$|He was unfortunate {{again on}} 22 April 1943 when, {{in command of}} Camilla on an RAAF {{contract}} involving the transport of military personnel to Port Moresby, he found himself unable to proceed due to bad weather, {{and was forced to}} attempt a night landing on the open ocean when off the coast of New Guinea. Due largely to the inexperience of his co-pilot, the aircraft broke up on landing, and 13 out of the 31 people on board did not survive. Koch <b>spent</b> <b>about</b> 18 hours in the sea before being rescued at the chance passage of a local steamer. A. B. Corbett, the Director-General of Civil Aviation, recommended to his Minister that in view of the circumstances no Court of Inquiry be held—in effect Koch was exonerated.|$|E
50|$|Later {{he moved}} to Göttingen where he was {{associated}} with Arnold Sommerfeld, David Hilbert and Georg Cantor. In Göttingen,Prasad showed his paper titled On the constitution of matter and the analytical theories of heat, {{the one he had}} submitted for the Adams prize competition, to Felix Klein, who appreciated it very much and got it published in the Göttingen Abhandllingen. Ganesh Prasad <b>spent</b> altogether <b>about</b> five years in Europe.|$|R
