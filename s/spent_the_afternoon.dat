5|$|When Bellingham {{received}} {{news of his}} forthcoming trial {{he asked}} Harmer to arrange {{for him to be}} represented in court by Brougham and Peter Alley, the latter an Irish lawyer with a reputation for flamboyance. Confident of his acquittal, Bellingham refused to discuss the case further with Harmer, and <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> and evening making notes. After drinking a glass of porter, he went to bed and slept soundly.|$|E
5|$|Farrar {{said that}} {{the day of the}} fire, about a month after Farrar's last release from the hospital, he had taken the day off from work—the first day of what he {{intended}} to be a week-long vacation to recover some strength after restarting his job post-hospital. He had <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> with Margaret Hacker and then picked up Tim and Kelly for Tim's hockey game. After dropping the children back off with their mother at about 8:45, he had dinner with Hacker, leaving her around 11:15 in the evening.|$|E
5|$|They {{held their}} first London gigs {{in support of}} the EP, under the advice of George and The Pooh Sticks lead singer Huw Williams. After warm up gigs in Cardiff and Birmingham, the London {{performance}} took place at the Samuel Beckett pub in Stoke Newington on 13 November 1993 alongside Anrehfn and Margi Clarke. Further Welsh radio and television appearances followed, as did an interview for NME. When George arrived for the interview, Matthews asked if he'd be interested in becoming the band's manager. He politely declined, saying that he didn't have the experience. On the 19 and 20 February 1994, the band's follow-up EP, Hooked was recorded in Llandwrog, Gwynedd, and produced by Ken Nelson who they had met on Radio Wales. A performance was set up at the Falcon the Splash Club in London where several music executives were to be present. The band drove down from Cardiff in a Ford Transit with their equipment and then <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> drinking. Just prior to going out on stage, they began taking cocaine, the result of which was a terrible performance later lamented by Roberts. The trip became a sobering experience, as they made no money from it and were only paid £50 for a gig at Kingston University a day later. Matthews later recalled that they'd needed to borrow money from a fan to pay the toll on the Severn Bridge {{on the way back to}} Cardiff.|$|E
50|$|As {{the chief}} {{assistant}} to the regent Jiang Wan, Fei Yi handled mostly domestic matters. He was described as so quick in his comprehension and decisions that he only needed mornings {{to carry out his}} duties, and he <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoons</b> entertaining guests. He was particularly skilful at playing weiqi. When Dong Yun succeeded him, he tried to follow Fei Yi's schedule, but after several days, the paperwork quickly backlogged, forcing him to work all day. Dong Yun thus became amazed at Fei Yi's abilities.|$|R

60|$|At length {{the morning}} came, {{and with it}} my father and brother, who {{returned}} from Yarmouth on hired horses, for their own were <b>spent.</b> In <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> also news followed them that the ships which had put to sea on the track of the Spaniard had been driven back by bad weather, having seen nothing of him.|$|R

25|$|At 20:05 local time, a {{thin white}} plume of smoke seemed {{for a moment}} to {{indicate}} the election was over, and the 40,000 people who had <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> watching the ceremonies on large screens in St. Peter's Square broke into applause and song. But the smoke quickly grew stronger and clearly dark. The crowd quieted and cleared in a matter of minutes.|$|E
5000|$|The family Pastor, {{consisting}} of four siblings {{coming from the}} industrial village of Onil in the Province of Alicante, started its journey in the sector in the 1970s. The entrepreneurial spirit of Agustín Pastor Beneyto focused on several weekly marketplaces located in many Valencian towns. Every day, {{in a different place}} of the Valencian Community, Agustín and his sons strived to offer and sell a large variety of dolls, toys and games which were made in the 'Toy Valley'- inland region which include the villages of Ibi, Castalla and Onil-, from where the family left at dawn every day. Besides these traditional marketplaces which took place every morning, <b>the</b> family Pastor <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoons</b> negotiating at different wholesalers growing to more than 1000 customers spread from the Costa Dorada to La Manga del Mar Menor.|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes, it has cheered me immensely. Then after {{a morning}} of {{delightful}} musings {{on one thing}} and another I went to lunch with a charming lady and <b>spent</b> most of <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> talking with her.” ...|$|R
25|$|Birney's {{movement}} was delayed by difficult terrain {{for most of}} August 15 and Hancock's plan for an early morning attack had to be abandoned. They reached Fussell's Mill around 1 p.m. and Birney <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>afternoon</b> performing a reconnaissance while his men recovered from their march. After this, Birney judged {{that it was too}} late in the day to attack.|$|R
25|$|They <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> cutting {{trees in}} the scrub and {{trimming}} them for rafters, though nothing had been farther from Henry's intention and inclination. He cut down a few little trees while Pietro cut {{a lot of big}} ones. Pietro always took the heavier end when they loaded the rails, but even so, Henry became exhausted. Round about four o'clock he decided to go home.|$|E
25|$|At Tiberias the Australian Mounted Division {{waited for}} the 5th Cavalry Division to close up and for the 4th Light Horse Brigade to rejoin from Semakh, bivouacking there for the night of 26 September.

25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of April 14, Booth learned that Abraham Lincoln would be attending a play at Ford's Theatre that night. Booth decided that {{the time had come}} to kill Lincoln.

50|$|After this incident, Lyons {{reportedly}} swore revenge {{to friends}} {{in his neighborhood}} hangouts and, borrowing a revolver from friend Alexander Neil, he intended to shoot Quinn on sight next time they met.

60|$|I <b>spent</b> all <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> with <b>the</b> lions, photographing them, {{listening}} to them spit and growl, watching them fight their chains, and roll up like balls of fire. From {{different parts of the}} forest I tried to creep unsuspected upon them; but always when I peeped out from behind a tree or log, every pair of ears would be erect, every pair of eyes gleaming and suspicious.|$|R
25|$|The {{course of}} the {{previous}} operations meant that both armies still had large detachments out towards Königsberg. The emperor <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> in forming up the newly arrived masses, the deployment being covered by an artillery bombardment. At 5 o'clock all was ready, and Ney, preceded by a heavy artillery fire, rapidly carried the Sortlack Wood. The attack was pushed on toward the Alle. Marshal Ney's right-hand division under Marchand drove part of the Russian left into the river at Sortlack, while the division of Bisson advanced on the left. A furious charge by Russian cavalry into the gap between Marchand and Bisson was repulsed by the dragoon division of Latour-Maubourg.|$|E
25|$|Churchill {{arrived in}} Antwerp around 3pm on 3 October. He {{set up in}} the best hotel in Antwerp with Admiral Oliver (Chief of Naval Intelligence) as his secretary, and <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> touring the defences under shellfire. He wore undress Trinity House uniform. Churchill soon came to an {{arrangement}} with the Belgians that they would hold out provided the British sent substantial reinforcements. He asked for the two naval brigades, “minus recruits”. On 4 October Churchill offered to resign from the Cabinet and take personal command of the newly formed Royal Naval Division, which would incorporate the Marine and Naval Brigades. Kitchener wanted to commit an Anglo-French expeditionary force to secure Antwerp, and annotated the telegram {{to say that he was}} willing to appoint Churchill a temporary lieutenant-general, but Asquith thought it unwise and recorded that Churchill’s suggestion was met with a “Homeric laugh” by the Cabinet. Instead Churchill was recalled to London. The Royal Marine brigade arrived on 4 October. The 1st and 2nd Naval Brigades were then sent. They consisted largely of untrained reservists. General Rawlinson arrived on 7 October to take charge. Churchill returned to London on 7 October as something of a hero, but this changed when Antwerp fell on 10 October. Around 2,500 of Churchill’s largely untrained troops were killed, taken prisoner or interned in the neutral Netherlands.|$|E
500|$|The next session began similarly—Dylan <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> writing lyrics, and {{the session}} {{continued}} into {{the early hours of}} February 17, when the musicians began to record [...] "Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again". After several musical revisions and false starts, the fourteenth take was the version selected for the album.|$|E

5000|$|Born in 1915 in Jacksonville, Florida, Williams {{learned to}} cook from his {{maternal}} grandmother, who had owned {{a restaurant in}} Lima, Ohio. When the Great Depression hit, his father's auto repair business failed, and {{the family moved to}} southern California. His father fared no better there and soon abandoned his wife, son, and daughter. Eventually, Williams found work on a date farm near Palm Springs, Sniff's Date Gardens in Indio. The couple who owned it, Dana and Abagail Sniff, took him in and drove him to high school in the mornings while he <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoons</b> working at <b>the</b> date shop and grounds. Williams lived with the Sniffs for seven years until just after his graduation from high school. His sister died in 1933 from a brain injury, after being hit {{in the head with a}} baseball. His mother returned to Florida, and Williams finished school and moved to Los Angeles.|$|R

[...] "No confidences, Watson; for they are mighty awkward {{if it comes to}} an arrest for conspiracy and murder." ...|$|R
500|$|The drummer {{immediately}} began drinking upon {{his arrival in}} Flint.

According to Lewis, Moon was drunk by the time the band went onstage at the Atwood High School football stadium.|$|E
500|$|In the end, Ward was {{not allowed}} to play. As his {{teammates}} faced Georgia Tech, there are conflicting reports as to Ward’s whereabouts. According to Time, Ward “sat calmly in a radio booth, watched his teammates defeat the Southerners, 9-to-2.” [...] According to Behee, Ward was not even allowed to watch the game from the press box, or even from the bench of his own stadium. Instead, he <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> in a fraternity house. [...] A third account states that Kipke “quietly sent Willis Ward off to scout another Michigan game in Wisconsin.” [...] The day after the Georgia Tech game was played, an editorial ran in The Michigan Daily stating [...] "that everyone who touched (the Ward affair) did so only to lose in respect and esteem." ...|$|E
500|$|On 1 August, {{before leaving}} the US to take up his post in Mogadishu, Ambassador Bishop visited United States Central Command—the {{military}} command for the Middle East and northeast Africa—where {{he spent most of}} the day with its commander, Gen.Norman Schwarzkopf. Ambassador Bishop, aware of the ongoing strife, believed [...] "the odds were better than even that we would have to leave Mogadishu under less than favorable circumstances." [...] Ambassador Bishop understood from his past experiences in Beirut and Liberia the importance of being prepared to deal with emergencies and <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> working with military experts to review the embassy's Emergencies and Evacuation (E) plan until he was [...] "satisfied...that [...] realized that it might have to conduct an evacuation from Mogadishu and was prepared to do that." [...] In its analysis of Operation Eastern Exit, the Center for Naval Analyses cited the Ambassador Bishop's previous experience and [...] "clear understanding of his role" [...] in the operation as one of the reasons Operation Eastern Exit went so well.|$|E

John told them shortly that she had got a lift home, and proceeded on his way.|$|R
500|$|Morgan led his {{division}} into Corydon. As {{the county}} commissioner exited the courthouse carrying a rifle {{he was shot}} dead, becoming the final casualty of the day. Morgan [...] the Legion {{as if they had}} been regular soldiers; their weapons and ammunition were seized or destroyed, and they were required to promise not return to arms for a period of time. The prisoners in the county jail were freed, including the Confederates who had been captured the previous day. The cavalrymen <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> plundering stores and collecting ransom money; Morgan threatened to torch three local mills, and demanded each of them pay $1,000 to prevent their destruction. The owners [...] negotiated the rate down to $500. The county treasurer paid $690 to spare the courthouse from being burnt, and two leading stores paid $600 each. His men robbed the townspeople freely, stealing items ranging from ice-skates and bonnets to guns and horses. The total amount taken by ransom and plunder was estimated at $26,450 ($ in 2009 chained dollars). The value of most of the stolen goods and property destruction was later reimbursed, mostly by the state government.|$|E
2500|$|When the Grants {{arrived at}} Athens they {{were greeted by}} King George I of Greece, who came aboard the Vandalia and <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> with Grant. The king sought Grant's advice {{concerning}} Greece's relations with Turkey and Grant found himself acting in a diplomatic capacity, knowing his advice would be received {{as a form of}} American interest. During their week-long visit in Athens, Grant scaled the Acropolis accompanied by Young, who noted that Grant appreciated [...] "the greatness of the past" [...] and was tireless during his walk through the ancient city.|$|E
2500|$|At this point, {{the battle}} devolved into a contest of sniping, as the Federal commanders {{attempted}} {{to reform the}} men into organized units in the difficult tangle while suppressing the fire from the hill top. [...] Gregg, meanwhile, found himself scrambling to provide enough time to allow the routed units to reform for the retreat. [...] The 1st Tennessee Infantry Battalion <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> feinting in various directions, and suffered heavy casualties for its efforts. The 50th Tennessee, having grown tired of standing in the Gallatin Road, traversed the battlefield from left to right, while the 41st Tennessee marched {{to the sound of}} firing on the left flank to protect it, unaware that the 50th Tennessee was already there. Moving to the left, it passed the 50th Tennessee headed in the opposite direction, and took up the 50th's former position on the flank.|$|E
30|$|During {{the first}} week of each summer session, {{teachers}} engaged in STEM DCs to support their learning about the relevant disciplinary content and to gain familiarity with the engineering design process. During the second summer week, middle school students identified by their teachers as struggling in mathematics or science were invited to attend each morning session; teachers worked alongside the students to solve a design challenge. Engineering, mathematics, and science professors from the university {{and a variety of other}} professionals (e.g., a prosthetics designer, a government climate scientist) interacted with the teachers and students. Teachers <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>afternoons</b> reflecting on <b>the</b> students’ engagement, analyzing instructional practices, and planning for the implementation of design challenges in their classrooms. While undertaking design challenges, teachers and students were involved in collaborative and creative problem solving, communication, and critical thinking. The use of various forms of technology was modeled during the professional development summer institutes. The recognition that every student could be a successful contributor to solving a design challenge was also an explicit element of the TESI project.|$|R
