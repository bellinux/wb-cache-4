40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} estimating and controlling {{the speed of a}} belt-driven casting drum in a web production process, where direct measurement of drum speed is infeasible. Techniques for estimating web tension and casting drum speed, using measured values of brake and drive torque demand and speed, are described and veried by application to a laboratory casting drum facility. The estimates of web tension and casting drum speed are incorporated in a new speed control strategy, which counteracts the effects of creep and slip between the drive belt and pulleys. Experimental results demonstrate much improved <b>steady-state</b> <b>speed</b> holding and transient speed response of the casting drum, in comparison with the performance of the original controller: the <b>steady-state</b> <b>speed</b> error with nominal (50 per cent) web tension is reduced from 0. 8 to 0. 1 per cent, while the peak transient speed error for a 25 per cent change in web tension reduces from 4 to 0. 5 per cent...|$|E

30|$|Although {{control of}} robotic fish powered by {{electrical}} motors {{has been well}} developed by many research groups [26 – 32], control of the robotic fish enabled by IPMC has rarely been studied based on our best knowledge. The possible reason might be lacking of a faithful and practical dynamic model of the robotic fish enabled by IPMC. Due to the complex actuation dynamics of IPMC and hydrodynamics of fish, {{it was a great}} challenge to get a physics-based control-oriented model. Two types of models have been developed, including a <b>steady-state</b> <b>speed</b> model [33] developed by Tan’s group at Michigan State University and a dynamic model [34] developed by Porfiri’s group at New York University. In this section, we will review the <b>steady-state</b> <b>speed</b> model [33] developed by Tan’s group. In this review, we will discuss Lighthill’s theory on elongated-body propulsion first. Then the IPMC beam dynamics in fluid will be discussed next, considering general force and moment inputs. This will be followed by the actuation model of IPMC caudal fin. Last, the model for computing the speed of IPMC-propelled robotic fish will be obtained by merging Lighthill’s theory and the hybrid tail dynamics. Most of the modeling work presented in this section was published in [14, 33].|$|E

The proposed algorithm combines the best features of harmonic detection and stator voltage integration {{through the use}} of a new tuning scheme.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{examined}} {{the process by which}} the intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes initiates actin-based motility and determined the contribution of the variable surface distribution of the ActA protein to initiation and steady-state movement. To directly correlate ActA distributions to actin dynamics and motility of live bacteria, ActA was fused to a monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP 1). Actin comet tail formation and steady-state bacterial movement rates both depended on ActA distribution, which in turn was tightly coupled to the bacterial cell cycle. Motility initiation was found to be a highly complex, multistep process for bacteria, in contrast to the simple symmetry breaking previously observed for ActA-coated spherical beads. F-actin initially accumulated along the sides of the bacterium and then slowly migrated to the bacterial pole expressing the highest density of ActA as a tail formed.

Over time, saltatory motility and sensitivity to the immediate environment decreased as bacterial movement became robust at a constant <b>steady-state</b> <b>speed...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Simulation {{has become}} an {{indispensable}} tool {{in the design and}} evaluation of mobile systems. By using mobility models that describe constituent movement, one can explore large systems, producing repeatable results for comparison between alternatives. In this paper, we show that a large class of mobility models—including all those in which nodal speed and distance or destination are chosen independently—have a transient period in which the average node speed decreases until converging to some long-term average. This speed decay provides an unsound basis for simulation studies that collect results averaged over time, complicating the experimental process. In this paper, we derive a general framework for describing this decay and apply it to a number of cases. Furthermore, this framework allows us to transform a given mobility model into a stationary one by initializing the simulation using the <b>steady-state</b> <b>speed</b> distribution and using the original speed distribution subsequently. This transformation completely eliminates the transient period and the decay in average node speed and, thus, provides sound models for the simulation of mobile systems.
