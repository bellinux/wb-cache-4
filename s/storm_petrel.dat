5|$|The European <b>storm</b> <b>petrel</b> can be {{distinguished}} from related Western Palaearctic species by the white bar on its underwing and its distinctive fluttering flight. Compared to Leach's <b>storm</b> <b>petrel,</b> band-rumped <b>storm</b> <b>petrel,</b> and the recently described Monteiro's <b>storm</b> <b>petrel,</b> it is also smaller, darker, shorter-winged and has a square tail. Wilson's <b>storm</b> <b>petrel</b> lacks an underwing bar, and has long legs with the feet visible beyond the tail.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{northern}} <b>storm</b> <b>petrel</b> undertake migrations after the breeding season. Species undertake migrations of differing lengths; long ones, {{such as the}} Swinhoe's <b>storm</b> <b>petrel,</b> which breeds in the west Pacific and migrates to the west Indian Ocean; or shorter ones, such as the black <b>storm</b> <b>petrel</b> which nests in southern California and migrates down the coast of Central America {{as far south as}} Colombia. Some species, like the Tristram's <b>storm</b> <b>petrel,</b> are thought to be essentially sedentary and do not undertake any migrations away from their breeding islands.|$|E
5|$|The European <b>storm</b> <b>petrel,</b> British <b>storm</b> <b>petrel</b> or just <b>storm</b> <b>petrel</b> (Hydrobates pelagicus) is a seabird in the {{northern}} <b>storm</b> <b>petrel</b> family, Hydrobatidae. It is {{the only member of}} the genus Hydrobates. The small, square-tailed bird is entirely black except for a broad white rump and a white band on the underwings, and it has a fluttering, bat-like flight. The large majority of the population breeds on islands off the coasts of Europe, with the greatest numbers in the Faroe Islands, United Kingdom, Ireland and Iceland. The Mediterranean population is a separate subspecies, but is inseparable at sea from its Atlantic relatives; its strongholds are Filfla Island (Malta), Sicily and the Balearic Islands.|$|E
50|$|Other {{important}} prey {{species that}} this specialized population of peregrines {{are fond of}} are fork-tailed <b>storm</b> <b>petrels,</b> Leach's <b>storm</b> <b>petrels,</b> and black-legged kittiwakes.|$|R
500|$|Northern <b>storm</b> <b>petrels</b> are [...] seabirds in {{the family}} Hydrobatidae, part of the order Procellariiformes. The family was once lumped with the similar austral <b>storm</b> <b>petrels</b> in the {{combined}} <b>storm</b> <b>petrels,</b> but have been split as they were not closely related. These smallest of seabirds feed on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. Their flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like.|$|R
500|$|Northern <b>storm</b> <b>petrels</b> are the {{smallest}} of all the seabirds, {{ranging in size from}} 13–25cm in length. [...] The Hydrobatidae have longer wings than the austral <b>storm</b> <b>petrels,</b> forked or wedge-shaped tails and shorter legs. The legs of all <b>storm</b> <b>petrels</b> are proportionally longer than those of other Procellariiformes, but they are very weak and unable to support the bird's weight {{for more than a few}} steps.|$|R
5|$|Several {{species of}} <b>storm</b> <b>petrel</b> are {{threatened}} by human activities. One species, the Guadalupe <b>storm</b> <b>petrel,</b> {{is thought to have}} gone extinct. The principal threats to storm petrels are introduced species, particularly mammals, in their breeding colonies; many storm petrels habitually nest on isolated mammal-free islands and are unable to cope with predators like rats and feral cats.|$|E
5|$|Sailors did, however, {{consider}} it unlucky {{to touch a}} <b>storm</b> <b>petrel,</b> especially one that has landed on the ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight is}} weak-looking and {{resembles that of}} a bat, with {{fluttering}} interspersed with short glides. When feeding, the birds hang with raised wings and patter on the surface with their feet, but, unlike the Wilson's <b>storm</b> <b>petrel,</b> do not {{look as if they}} are walking on the water. Birds will sometimes settle on the sea. Like other petrels, the European <b>storm</b> <b>petrel</b> cannot walk properly on land, but shuffles on its tarsi; once there is enough room, the bird flaps its wings to support itself on its toes.|$|E

25|$|Austral <b>storm</b> <b>petrels</b> are the {{smallest}} of all the seabirds, {{ranging in size from}} 15–26cm in length. There are two body shapes in the family; the austral <b>storm</b> <b>petrels</b> have short wings, square tails, elongated skulls, and long legs. The legs of all <b>storm</b> <b>petrels</b> are proportionally longer than those of other Procellariiformes, but they are very weak and unable to support the bird's weight {{for more than a few}} steps.|$|R
5|$|All {{but two of}} the Hydrobatidae {{are mostly}} dark in colour with varying amounts of white on the rump. Two species have {{different}} plumage entirely, the Hornby's <b>storm</b> <b>petrel</b> which has white undersides and facial markings, and the fork-tailed <b>storm</b> <b>petrel</b> which has pale grey plumage. This is a notoriously difficult group to identify at sea. Onley and Scofield (2007) state that much published information is incorrect, and that photographs in the major seabird books and websites are frequently incorrectly ascribed as to species. They also consider that several national bird lists include species which have been incorrectly identified or have been accepted on inadequate evidence.|$|E
5|$|Because {{it feeds}} in flight, the <b>storm</b> <b>petrel</b> is less {{affected}} by oil pollution than other seabirds, {{and may be}} able to use its good sense of smell to avoid slicks, although a large spill near a breeding colony could have serious consequences.|$|E
5|$|The European {{population}} of the <b>storm</b> <b>petrel</b> has been estimated at 430,000–510,000 breeding pairs or 1,290,000–1,530,000 individual birds and makes up 95% of the world total numbers. The population estimate includes about 11,000 to 16,000 breeding pairs of the Mediterranean subspecies.|$|E
50|$|Hydrobatinae {{is one of}} two subfamilies of <b>storm</b> <b>petrels.</b> The {{distribution}} of the subfamily is predominantly in the northern hemisphere. The subfamily contains two (sometimes three) genera in which there are 18 species. They were the first group of <b>storm</b> <b>petrels</b> to break off from the ancestral petrel stock, and for this reason some authors have suggested that they should constitute a separate family from the Oceanitinae <b>storm</b> <b>petrels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Austral <b>storm</b> <b>petrels</b> are the {{smallest}} of all the seabirds, {{ranging in size from}} 15-26 cm in length. There are two body shapes in the family; the austral <b>storm</b> <b>petrels</b> have short wings, square tails, elongated skulls, and long legs.

50|$|Austral <b>storm</b> <b>petrels,</b> or {{southern}} <b>storm</b> <b>petrels,</b> are seabirds in {{the family}} Oceanitidae, part of the order Procellariiformes. These smallest of seabirds feed on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. Their flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like.|$|R
5|$|Breton {{folklore}} {{holds that}} storm petrels are {{the spirits of}} sea-captains who mistreated their crew, doomed to spend eternity flying over the sea, and they are also held to be the souls of drowned sailors. A sailing superstition holds that {{the appearance of a}} <b>storm</b> <b>petrel</b> foretells bad weather. Sinister names from Britain and France include waterwitch, satanite, satanique and oiseau du diable.|$|E
5|$|Feather mites of {{at least}} two species have been found on the <b>storm</b> <b>petrel,</b> with Halipeurus pelagicus {{occurring}} at much higher densities than Philoceanus robertsi. The flea Xenopsylla gratiosa and dermanyssid mites are commonly found, with lower numbers of ticks. These blood-sucking parasites slow the growth rate of nestlings and may affect their survival rate.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels nest colonially, for {{the most}} part on islands, {{although}} a few species breed on the mainland, particularly Antarctica. Nesting sites are attended nocturnally in order to avoid predators; the wedge-rumped storm petrels nesting in the Galapagos Islands are the exception to this rule and attend their nesting sites during the day. Storm petrels display high levels of philopatry, returning to their natal colonies to breed. In one instance a band-rumped <b>storm</b> <b>petrel</b> was caught as an adult 2m from its natal burrow. Storm petrels nest either in burrows dug into soil or sand, or in small crevices in rocks and scree. Competition for nesting sites is intense in colonies where storm petrels compete with other burrowing petrels, with shearwaters having been recorded killing storm petrels in order to occupy their burrows. Colonies can be extremely large and dense densities as high as 8 pairs/m2 for band-rumped storm petrels in the Galapagos and colonies 3.6 million strong for Leach's <b>storm</b> <b>petrel</b> have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|<b>Storm</b> <b>petrels</b> use {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} to aid flight. Most species will occasionally feed by surface pattering, holding and moving their feet on the water's surface while holding steady above the water. They remain stationary by hovering with rapid fluttering or by using the wind to anchor themselves in place. This method of feeding flight is more commonly used by Oceanitidae <b>storm</b> <b>petrels</b> however. Northern <b>storm</b> <b>petrels</b> also use dynamic soaring, gliding across wave fronts gaining energy from the vertical wind gradient.|$|R
2500|$|Austral <b>storm</b> <b>petrels,</b> or {{southern}} <b>storm</b> <b>petrels,</b> are [...] seabirds in {{the family}} Oceanitidae, part of the order Procellariiformes. These smallest of seabirds feed on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering. Their flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like.|$|R
5000|$|It {{had been}} {{believed}} to be extinct, but on 25 January 2003 a possible sighting was made by Sav Saville, Brent Stephenson and others close to the Mercury Islands off the Coromandel Peninsula of New Zealand's North Island, leading to several inconclusive photographs and an article being published. On 17 November 2003 while looking for black-bellied <b>storm</b> <b>petrels</b> and white-faced <b>storm</b> <b>petrels,</b> Bob Flood and Bryan Thomas obtained good photographs and video of 10 to 20 New Zealand <b>storm</b> <b>petrels</b> off Great Barrier and Little Barrier Islands in the Hauraki Gulf. [...] Subsequently, four <b>storm</b> <b>petrels</b> were captured and released in a similar area in late 2005/early 2006, three with radio transmitters attached. Tour operators have also regularly seen these birds on the Hauraki Gulf since this time.|$|R
5|$|The {{average life}} span is unknown but {{in common with}} seabirds such as the {{wandering}} albatross and Leach's <b>storm</b> <b>petrel,</b> frigatebirds are long-lived. In 2002, 35 ringed great frigatebirds were recovered on Tern Island in the Hawaiian Islands. Of these ten were older than 37 years and one was at least 44 years of age.|$|E
5|$|The diet of many storm petrels {{species is}} poorly known owing to {{difficulties}} in researching; overall {{the family is}} thought to concentrate on crustaceans. Small fish, oil droplets and molluscs are also taken by many species. Some species {{are known to be}} rather more specialised; the grey-backed <b>storm</b> <b>petrel</b> is known to concentrate on the larvae of goose barnacles.|$|E
5|$|The <b>storm</b> <b>petrel</b> breeds on {{exposed and}} usually {{uninhabited}} islands which it visits only at night. It otherwise frequents mid-depth waters {{away from the}} coastal zone, but not over the ocean deeps. In the breeding season, it is mainly found between the 10–25°C July isotherms. In Europe, it is rarely seen from land except in autumn storms.|$|E

5|$|Storm petrels {{face the}} same threats as other seabirds; in {{particular}} they are threatened by introduced species. The Guadalupe <b>storm</b> <b>petrel</b> was driven to extinction by feral cats, and introduced predators have also been responsible for declines in other species. Habitat degradation which limits nesting opportunities caused by introduced goats and pigs is also a problem, especially if it increases competition from more aggressive burrowing petrels.|$|E
5|$|The <b>storm</b> <b>petrel</b> is {{sexually mature}} at age 4–5 years, with the Mediterranean {{subspecies}} typically breeding {{a year earlier}} than the Atlantic form. Breeding happens in colonies and normally begins in late May or June. Pairs have a repeated nocturnal display flight in which the male chases the female, the chase being accompanied by flight calls. Some near-adult birds may pair up and occupy a hole at the same time, prior to breeding in the following year.|$|E
5|$|The <b>storm</b> <b>petrel</b> nests in crevices and burrows, {{sometimes}} {{shared with}} other seabirds or rabbits, and lays a single white egg, usually on bare soil. The adults share the lengthy incubation and both feed the chick, {{which is not}} normally brooded after the first week. This bird is strongly migratory, spending the northern hemisphere winter mainly off the coasts of South Africa and Namibia, with some birds stopping in the seas adjoining West Africa, and a few remaining near their Mediterranean breeding islands. This petrel is strictly oceanic outside the breeding season. It feeds on small fish, squid and zooplankton while pattering on the sea's surface, and can find oily edible items by smell. The food is converted in the bird's stomach to an oily orange liquid which is regurgitated when the chick is fed. Although usually silent at sea, the <b>storm</b> <b>petrel</b> has a chattering call given by both members of a pair in their courtship flight, and the male has a purring song given from the breeding chamber.|$|E

5|$|Like many seabirds <b>storm</b> <b>petrels</b> will {{associate}} with {{other species of}} seabird and marine mammal species {{in order to help}} obtain food. It is theorised that they benefit from the actions of diving predators such as seals and penguins which push prey up towards the surface while hunting, allowing the surface feeding <b>storm</b> <b>petrels</b> to reach them.|$|R
