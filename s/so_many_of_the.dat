5|$|Special coins {{for sale}} to {{collectors}} were struck in proof finish through {{the run of the}} Susan B. Anthony dollar, and some minting variations are valuable to collectors. However, most circulation strikes remained in government stockpiles for several years after minting, <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coins are available in uncirculated grades, and the premium over face value is minimal.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1980s {{and early}} 1990s, the estate {{was the home}} of a large {{squatter}} community, mostly made up of young punks from Ireland, Wales, Scotland and outside London, which greatly enlivened the area but also led to many legal and other conflicts with Haringey Council, who ironically had left <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> properties empty in the first place. Many of these were later to move to the Woodberry Down Estate in Manor House.|$|E
5|$|Iftah Ya Simsim was {{the first}} children's {{educational}} TV program {{of its kind in}} the Arab world and the first Sesame Street co-production in the region. It {{was the first}} co-production to use Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). Its development was similar to that of the American version of Sesame Street in the late 1960s. The GCC considered creating a co-production for many years, so consultations were held among its member countries regarding how to do <b>so.</b> <b>Many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early co-productions were simple, dubbed versions with local language voice-overs and instructional cutaways, but the GCC wanted to create their own original version.|$|E

5|$|Monosaccharides in a closed-chain form {{can form}} glycosidic bonds with other monosaccharides, {{creating}} disaccharides (such as sucrose) and polysaccharides (such as starch). Enzymes must hydrolyze or otherwise break these glycosidic bonds before such compounds become metabolized. After digestion and absorption the principal monosaccharides {{present in the}} blood and internal tissues include glucose, fructose, and galactose. Many pentoses and hexoses can form ring structures. In these closed-chain forms, the aldehyde or ketone group remains non-free, <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reactions typical of these groups cannot occur. Glucose in solution exists mostly in the ring form at equilibrium, with less than 0.1% of the molecules in the open-chain form.|$|E
5|$|The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., {{was filmed}} {{primarily}} on the Warner Bros. soundstages. Town and street scenes were staged on the Western backlot, known as Laramie Street. It {{was one of the}} last Western shows to use the backlot. Cuse said that logistics were a problem because <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hollywood Western sets and towns had been torn down by the 1990s. Outdoor scenes were shot on the Warner Bros. ranch in Valencia, California; Bronson Canyon in Los Angeles; and the Valuze Ranch in Santa Clarita, California. Some of the locomotive scenes from Brisco were filmed on location at Railtown 1897 State Historic Park in Jamestown, California. A painting used in the show as a backdrop to create illusions of greater depth perspectives is exhibited at the park.|$|E
5|$|The {{aristocracy}} {{shared their}} power {{only with the}} Roman Catholic Church. The Church ruled by fear of damnation in the next life and of the Inquisition in the present, and consequently both upper and lower classes gave as generously as they could on all major saints' days. Many priests and bishops {{were members of the}} aristocracy. The wealth of the Church in Sicily was further enhanced by the tradition of pressing younger children of the aristocracy to enter monasteries and convents, in order to preserve the family estates from division; a large fee, or dowry, was usually paid to the Church to facilitate this, in the form of property, jewels, or money. Thus the wealth of certain religious orders grew out of all proportion to the economic growth of any other group at this time. This {{is one of the reasons}} that <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sicilian Baroque churches and monasteries, such as San Martino delle Scale, were rebuilt after 1693 on such a lavish scale.|$|E

5|$|The {{starting}} point for string theory {{is the idea that}} the point-like particles of quantum field theory can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings. The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum field theory. At the level of Feynman diagrams, this means replacing the one-dimensional diagram representing the path of a point particle by a two-dimensional surface representing the motion of a string. Unlike in quantum field theory, string theory does not yet have a full non-perturbative definition, <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain out of reach.|$|E
5|$|Unlike her {{children}} and grandchildren, Olga was given a pension {{by the government of}} the Second Hellenic Republic, but she maintained <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> faithful old servants who had fled Greece with her that she was usually left with no more than 20 pounds sterling per month (worth about £ in 2010 prices) to meet her own expenses. She could, however, count on the support of her family, scattered throughout Western Europe. In the United Kingdom, she shared her time between Spencer House, London, the residence of her youngest son, Prince Christopher; Regent's Park, where her daughter, Grand Duchess Marie, rented a mansion; Sandringham House, the home of her sister-in-law, Queen Alexandra; and Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace, where her nephew, King George V, lent apartments.|$|E
5|$|The Provisional Legislature met for two {{sessions}} in late 1848 and early 1849. The first session, from December 5 to December 13, never formally organized as <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> representatives had traveled south for the California Gold Rush. Beginning on February 5, a session was organized that conducted the final {{business of the}} Provisional Government. The session lasted until February 16. During this session a law forbidding the sale of firearms and supplies to Native Americans was repealed, and a law was passed to authorize the minting of gold coins. The law concerning the coins allowed {{for the creation of}} the Beaver Coins, which had a higher gold content than United States minted coins. Less than a month later, when the new territorial governor Joseph Lane arrived, however, he rescinded the law as unconstitutional and the coins were collected and removed from circulation. For the legislative session Ralph Wilcox was chosen as speaker, but he resigned from the post. Stephen Meek served as the doorkeeper, William G. T’Vault as a clerk, and William Holmes as sergeant at arms.|$|E

5|$|Members are {{arranged}} in a hemicycle according to their political groups (in the Common Assembly, prior to 1958, members sat alphabetically) who are ordered mainly by left to right, but some smaller groups are placed towards the outer ring of the Parliament. All desks are equipped with microphones, headphones for translation and electronic voting equipment. The leaders of the groups sit on the front benches at the centre, and in the very centre is a podium for guest speakers. The remaining half of the circular chamber is primarily composed of the raised area where the President and staff sit. Further benches are provided between the sides of this area and the MEPs, these are {{taken up by the}} Council on the far left and the Commission on the far right. Both the Brussels and Strasbourg hemicycle roughly follow this layout with only minor differences. The hemicycle design is a compromise between the different Parliamentary systems. The British-based system has the different groups directly facing each other while the French-based system is a semicircle (and the traditional German system had all members in rows facing a rostrum for speeches). Although the design is mainly based on a semicircle, the opposite ends of the spectrum do still face each other. With access to the chamber limited, entrance is controlled by ushers who aid MEPs in the chamber (for example in delivering documents). The ushers can also occasionally act as a form of police in enforcing the President, for example in ejecting an MEP who is disrupting the session (although this is rare). The first head of protocol in the Parliament was French, <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> duties in the Parliament are based on the French model first developed following the French Revolution. The 180 ushers are highly visible in the Parliament, dressed in black tails and wearing a silver chain, and are recruited {{in the same manner as}} the European civil service. The President is allocated a personal usher.|$|E
