25|$|The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was {{the first}} {{government}} to legalize abortion and make it available on request, often for no cost.

However, Google has been working on an algorithm with the purpose of eliminating the need for pre-programmed maps and instead, creating a device that would be able to adjust to a variety of new surroundings.
