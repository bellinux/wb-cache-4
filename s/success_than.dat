5|$|A further {{explanation}} is that females might prefer brighter males, so sexual selection could result in aposematic males having higher reproductive <b>success</b> <b>than</b> non-aposematic males if they can survive long enough to mate.

5|$|Ajax {{had little}} success in European {{competition}} {{prior to their}} meeting with Liverpool. They had qualified for the European Cup Winners' Cup twice during the 1960–61 and 1961–62 seasons, but did not progress past the first round either time. Liverpool had only participated in European competition during the previous two season, but they had more <b>success</b> <b>than</b> Ajax. Their first season of competition in 1964–65 they reached the semi-finals of the European Cup, losing to eventual winners Internazionale. The following season they reached {{the final of the}} European Cup Winners' Cup, however, they lost 2–1 against German team Borussia Dortmund.|$|E
5|$|It had {{an opening}} weekend of $800,000 (3.38 crore) {{and went on}} to gross $1.3 million (5.49 crore) in its first week. It became the first film to cross $5 million mark outside India, and became the highest grosser ever that time. The film earned a total of $6.3 million (26.61 crore) {{at the end of its}} {{theatrical}} run. It became the second Bollywood film to break into the UK cinema top 10 after Dil Se.. which released the same year. It was a bigger box office <b>success</b> <b>than</b> Titanic when it was screened in Indonesia. Overseas, It is the highest-grossing film of 1998.|$|E
5|$|Labyrinth was {{the first}} {{adventure}} game created by Lucasfilm. The project was led by designer David Fox, who invented its word wheels to avoid the text parsers and syntax guessing typical of text-based adventure games. Early in development, the team collaborated with author Douglas Adams in a week-long series of brainstorming sessions, which inspired much of the final product. Labyrinth received positive reviews and, in the United States, was a bigger commercial <b>success</b> <b>than</b> the film upon which it was based. Its design influenced Lucasfilm's subsequent adventure title, the critically acclaimed Maniac Mansion.|$|E

Bruce Bochy stated that after the All Star break, Cain would move from the {{second place in the}} Giants starting rotation to fifth. Bochy added that Cain falling in the order {{had more to do with}} everyone else's <b>successes</b> <b>than</b> any shortcomings of Cain.|$|R
50|$|Compagnoni soon {{attracted}} {{attention for}} her great talent. Her career was always marked by major successes, {{but also by}} serious accidents. After her first major victory, the World Junior title in Giant slalom, and her first podium in World Cup, she broke her right knee in the Val d'Isére downhill. After surgery she decided to stop competing in downhill races, where her talent could have permitted even greater <b>successes</b> <b>than</b> those she obtained in her still outstanding career.|$|R
5|$|Males sing {{constantly}} as {{the breeding}} period approaches and perform less often once pairs have bonded. In {{the presence of}} a female, a male sometimes flies to his nest and sings from the entrance, apparently attempting to entice the female in. Older birds tend to have a wider repertoire than younger ones. Those males that engage in longer bouts of singing and that have wider repertoires attract mates earlier and have greater reproductive <b>success</b> <b>than</b> others. Females appear to prefer mates with more complex songs, perhaps because this indicates greater experience or longevity. Having a complex song is also useful in defending a territory and deterring less experienced males from encroaching.|$|E
5|$|Merrick was now {{homeless}} on {{the streets}} of Leicester. His uncle, a barber named Charles Merrick, heard of his nephew's situation, sought him out and offered him accommodation in his home. Merrick continued to hawk around Leicester {{for the next two years}} but his efforts to earn a living met with little more <b>success</b> <b>than</b> before. Eventually, his disfigurement drew such negative attention from members of the public that the Commissioners for Hackney Carriages withdrew his licence when it came up for renewal. With young children to provide for, Charles could no longer afford to support his nephew. In late December 1879, now 17 years old, Merrick entered the Leicester Union Workhouse.|$|E
5|$|On defense, Boston College {{had more}} <b>success</b> <b>than</b> {{predicted}} by pre-game coverage. Jamie Silva's fumble {{return for a}} touchdown was the first defensive score in ACC Championship Game history. Silva finished the game with five tackles (one for loss), oneinterception, the forced fumble, and the defensive touchdown. DeLeon Gause, meanwhile, was the Eagles' leading tackler, recording 10stops including one tackle for loss. Altogether, the Eagles recorded foursacks and ninetackles for loss, holding the Hokie offense in check {{for most of the}} game.|$|E

5|$|The daily {{syndicated}} version debuted on September 10, 1984, and {{was launched}} {{in response to the}} success of the syndicated version of Wheel and the installation of electronic trivia games in pubs and bars. This version of the program has met with greater <b>success</b> <b>than</b> the previous incarnations; it has outlived 300 other game shows and become the second most popular game show in syndication (behind Wheel), averaging 25 million viewers per week. The show's most recent renewal, in May 2017, extends it through the 2019–2020 season.|$|E
5|$|The games {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Most critics {{praised the}} addition of Wi-Fi features and felt that the gameplay, though it had not received much updating from previous games, was still engaging. Reviewers were divided on the graphics, however, and the audio was criticized as being primitive. The games enjoyed more commercial <b>success</b> <b>than</b> their Game Boy Advance predecessors: with around 18 million units sold worldwide, Diamond and Pearl have sold over 2 million more units than Ruby and Sapphire and almost 6 million more units than FireRed and LeafGreen, while outselling their successors, Black and White, by over 2 million copies.|$|E

Having scored an even bigger ratings and critical <b>success</b> <b>than</b> its previous series, its triumph even led Wood to be invited on that year's prestigious Royal Variety Performance.|$|E
40|$|A central {{implication}} of life-cycle models is that agents smooth consumption. We review the empirical evidence on smoothing at frequencies {{from within the}} year up to across a lifetime. We find that life-cycle models [...] particular those which incorporate realistic features of markets and goods [...] have more empirical <b>successes</b> <b>than</b> failures. We also show that some apparent deviations from theoretical predictions imply very small welfare losses for agents. Finally, we emphasize that the coherence of life-cycle models imposes an important discipline when incorporating new features into models. ...|$|R

40|$|Inspection is a {{fundamental}} means of achieving software usability. Past research showed that during usability inspection the success rate (percentage of problems detected) of each individual inspector was rather low. We developed perspective-based usability inspection, which divides the large variety of usability issues along di erent perspectives and focuses each inspection session on one perspective. We conducted a controlled experiment to study its e ectiveness, using a post-test only control group experimental design, with 24 professionals as subjects. The control group used heuristic evaluation, {{which is the most}} popular technique for usability inspection. The experimental results are that 1) for usability problems covered by each perspective, the inspectors using that perspective had higher <b>success</b> rate <b>than</b> others � 2) for all usability problems, perspective inspectors had higher average <b>success</b> rate <b>than</b> heuristic inspectors � 3) for all usability problems, the union of three perspective inspectors (with one from each perspective) had higher average <b>success</b> rate <b>than</b> the union of three heuristic inspectors...|$|R
5|$|Tisdale's second studio album, Guilty Pleasure (2009), was {{released}} to less commercial <b>success</b> <b>than</b> its predecessor. Tisdale would part ways with Warner Bros. Records following {{the release of}} the album. During this time, Tisdale began appearing in more films and returned to television with shows such as Hellcats (2010). Tisdale's production company Blondie Girl Productions, first formed in 2008, signed a multi-year production deal with Relativity Media in 2010; Tisdale would produce shows such as Miss Advised (2012) as part of the deal. Tisdale starred in the High School Musical spin-off film Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure (2011), releasing a soundtrack to promote the film. This marked her final portrayal of the character to date.|$|E
5|$|Alice in Wonderland, {{released}} in 1951, {{met with a}} lukewarm response {{at the box office}} and was a sharp critical disappointment in its initial release. Peter Pan, {{released in}} 1953, was, on the other hand, a commercial success and the highest-grossing film of the year. In 1955, Lady and the Tramp was released to higher box office <b>success</b> <b>than</b> any other Disney feature from the studio since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, earning an estimated $7.5 million in rentals at the North American box office in 1955. Lady is significant as Disney's first widescreen animated feature, produced in the CinemaScope process, and was the first Disney animated feature to be released by Disney's own distribution company, Buena Vista Distribution.|$|E
5|$|As with Georgia, Virginia Tech's {{kicking and}} special teams proved {{to have more}} <b>success</b> <b>than</b> either aspect of the offense. Virginia Tech kicker Brandon Pace scored a single 28-yard field goal late in the fourth quarter, and punter Nic Schmitt blasted four punts {{for a total of}} 195yards, {{averaging}} 48.8yards a punt. Pace's field goal helped to trigger a late-game rally by Virginia Tech, which had been stunned by a Georgia onside kick and several interceptions thrown by Glennon. Schmitt's long punts, meanwhile, denied Georgia good field position {{in the first half of}} the game. Only in the second half, when Glennon's interceptions allowed Georgia to start on the Tech side of the field, was the Georgia offense able to reach the end zone. In the first and second quarters, Georgia's average starting position was their own 19-yard line and own 26-yard line, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Bliege Bird et al. {{observed}} turtle {{hunting and}} spear fishing patterns in a Meriam {{community in the}} Torres Strait of Australia, publishing their findings in 2001. Here, only some Meriam men were able to accumulate high caloric gains {{for the amount of}} time spent turtle hunting or spear fishing (reaching a threshold measured in kcal/h). Since a daily catch of fish is carried home by hand and turtles are frequently served at large feasts, members of the community know which men most reliably brought them turtle meat and fish. Thus, turtle hunting qualifies as a costly signal. Furthermore, turtle hunting and spear fishing are actually less productive (in kcal/h) than foraging for shellfish, where success depends only on the amount of time dedicated to searching, so shellfish foraging is a poor signal of skill or strength. This suggests that energetic gains are not the primary reason men take part in turtle hunting and spear fishing. A follow-up study found that successful Meriam hunters do experience greater social benefits and reproductive <b>success</b> <b>than</b> less skilled hunters.|$|E
5|$|For 1987, Forti {{moved up}} to International Formula 3000 with less {{immediate}} <b>success</b> <b>than</b> experienced in Formula Three. The main reason for this was the chassis the team chose to compete with. Instead of using customer Lolas, Marches or Ralts, {{all of which were}} produced by established companies who had many years' experience of designing and building such cars, Forti stuck with their Italian Formula Three chassis supplier Gian Paolo Dallara, who had just designed his company's first F3000 machine. Forti was the first team to use this machine, which was dubbed the Dallara 3087 (a chassis which later would make a single appearance in Formula One for the BMS Scuderia Italia team, as that team's car was not ready for the first race of the 1988 season). This combination of an inexperienced team and an untested car did not score any points in its first F3000 year, nor did the team attend every race on the schedule. Forti used 1988 to gain valuable experience in F3000, and this helped the team to perform better in following seasons, as did a change to more competitive Lola and then Reynard chassis.|$|E
5|$|Grand Theft Auto III {{took the}} {{gameplay}} {{foundation of the}} first two Grand Theft Auto games and expanded it into a 3D world, and offered an unprecedented variety of minigames and side-missions. The title was a much greater commercial <b>success</b> <b>than</b> its direct precursors, and its influence was profound. As such, Grand Theft Auto III is credited with popularizing this genre, let alone inventing it. Its release is sometimes treated as a revolutionary event in the history of video games, much like the release of Doom nearly a decade earlier. GamePro called it the most important game of all time, and claimed that every genre was influenced to rethink their conventional level design. IGN similarly praised it {{as one of the top}} ten most influential games of all time. Subsequent games that follow this formula of driving and shooting in a free-roaming level have been called Grand Theft Auto clones.|$|E
