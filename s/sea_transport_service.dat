Posted to Eastern Command Headquarters, Paddington, he was granted the rank of staff sergeant, but found staff work to be dull and sought his discharge in February 1941. In August 1944, Howell enlisted in the United States Army for service in the United States <b>Sea</b> <b>Transport</b> <b>Service,</b> and was thus able to participate in the invasion of Leyte at the commencement of the Philippines campaign.|$|E
5|$|Born in {{a suburb}} of Sydney, New South Wales, Howell was {{employed}} as a builder before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in June 1915. Allotted to the force's 1st Battalion, he served at Gallipoli prior to transferring to the Western Front. Participating in the Somme offensive of 1916, Howell was wounded at Pozières and promoted to corporal in early 1917. During an attack on a German held village, he led a rifle bombing section and was awarded the Military Medal for his actions. Severely wounded in his Victoria Cross action, Howell underwent a prolonged hospitalisation period before returning to Australia and receiving his discharge on medical grounds. Settling in Coogee, he gained employment by working on the advertising staff of several newspapers. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Howell served with the Australian Eastern Command Headquarters but soon sought his discharge and enlisted with the United States <b>Sea</b> <b>Transport</b> <b>Service.</b> He died in 1964 at the age of 71.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{offers an}} {{overview}} of relevant market definition in the <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> sector. The author examines the <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> sector {{through the eyes of}} Article 82 EC and its inherent concept of relevant market definition. Two main questions are answered in this thesis: 1) How is the relevant market in the <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> sector defined in EC competition law? 2) What must shipping companies take into consideration when defining it? The Community’s goal for the future of EC maritime trade is to – {{with the help of the}} Marco Polo programme –shift billions of tonnes kilometres from land <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> to <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> making <b>transport</b> in the Community more environmentally sound. The shifting consists of tens of per cent of tonnes kilometres which will naturally increase the frequency and thus importance of <b>sea</b> <b>transport.</b> It is the author’s view that along with this increase in sea borne trade will follow an increased amount of cases before the Commission, the Community Courts with regard to shipping and competition. Due to this future increase and due to the lack of Community case law on relevant market definition as regards the <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> sector, the author’s finds that there is an acute need for an analysis with regard to this area. The thesis encompasses both relevant product market definition and relevant geographic market definition and encompasses six chapters. The first four chapters offer the reader an introduction to the concept of competition, {{an overview of}} competition law in the EC especially with regard to relevant market definition. The fifth chapter shows how the relevant market may be defined in the <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> sector by examining how relevant markets have been defined in the case law of the Community Courts and how this market has been assessed by the Commission. The discussion is both analytical as well as speculative. The study ends with conclusions in chapter six...|$|R

Also the future prospects of SSS are discussed. Secondly, our dataset needs are described and the characteristics of the resulting actual dataset are given. Thirdly, a regression analysis is performed on the country level to analyze the SSS growth potential in the respective European countries. Several different regression analyses are performed, and also different segments are analyzed. In order to check the results, a DEA analysis is performed to see which countries are efficient in SSS and which countries are less efficient. Last of all, several hypothesis are tested.

30|$|The {{operations}} of international businesses {{have become very}} much linked. These linkages are related to international trade activities as goods are produced in one country and consumed in another country. Shipping and trading centres are located in TCEs. Connectivity, which measures {{the extent to which}} the components of a network are connected to one another, is a key factor that affects the importance of TCEs. The strategic importance of TCEs is affected by the factors of location, accessibility, and infrastructure (Lun et al. 2010). A TCE comprises a set of transport infrastructures that take advantage of their corresponding geographical location to provide a high level of accessibility for connecting with trading partners. Accessibility, which refers to the extent to which a user can obtain the required resources at the time that they are needed, is the cornerstone of the competitiveness of TCEs. For instance, a TCE needs to access water to provide <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services.</b> Connection with the hinterland, which is “the area where the demand for cargo movement is generated” and foreland, which is “the cargo destinations that are connected by shipping services from the cargo sources” (Rodrigue & Notteboom 2010) is also essential for nurturing the development of TCEs.|$|R
30|$|Most of the {{literature}} on slow-steaming either takes the perspective of shipowners addressing technical, operational or cost-minimisation issues—assuming that the effect on shippers is fully captured by an increased cost of capital tied up in the transported products—or that of society with implications of lower emissions by slow-steaming. In reality, however, the effects on supply chains using container liner shipping is far more complex; consequently, this study takes the perspective of the shippers. The purpose is to briefly elaborate on the logistics consequences of slow-steaming, categorise principle mitigation strategies, and investigate and categorise the strategies Swedish shippers purchasing deep <b>sea</b> container <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> use to cope with the effects of slow-steaming.|$|R

40|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>transport</b> for {{passengers}} {{is an interesting}} intermodal transport concept by definition, nevertheless, the concept has not been widely developed in Italy. Normative and infrastructural conditions generally form a major impediment. However in some regions new short sea shipping services, as alternative to public <b>transport</b> <b>services,</b> are being developed. These services have two main objectives: to offer a valid alternative to road public transport {{in order to reduce}} transport emission, and to facilitate the coast use for tourist. The paper analyses five study cases where <b>sea</b> public <b>transport</b> have been implemented and are going to be developed. The Campania Region Metrò del Mare represent a model for the rest of Italian regions, as it is the first <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> system operating from 2001, with nine lines and 23 touristic ports-stations. It is designed as a real sea-metro system with over 270. 000 passengers in the seven months when it is active. Another interesting case study is the Genova <b>sea</b> public <b>transport</b> (in Liguria Region), that is operating from 2007. In this area touristic services are working since 1980, but only few years ago a new transport secrives (Navebus) was developed with the aim of give to commuters a valid alternative to the road private and public trasport. The case of the Reggio Calabria-Messina sea metro system, the Lazio Region and MTB Metromarina study cases show good design and opportunities for connecting with a real public transport system major touristic port along the coast. For different reasons these services are not yet implemented. The conclusion of this work shows some point of interest fro <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> system planning: - To give to <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> the assessment of real public transport, in order to receive finances from the region (as in the Campania and Liguria study cases) - To create e integrated fares system in order to facilitate rail, road and sea services for commuters and tourists along the coast (as in Campania Region). - To promote the tourist use of sea services creating a network with the mayor touristic attraction along the coast that will be accessible by the new sea services; - To organize and design the sea services as a metro <b>transport</b> <b>service,</b> with high frequencies and many stops - To renew the tourist ports that will be accessible by the sea services with a “transit oriented approach”. The new interest shown for short sea passenger trasport represents an interesting challenge for local administration for give a contribute to the efforts of reducing trasport enviromental impacts and to promote costal areas for touristic uses.

30|$|The growing {{importance}} of global competition in international business has stimulated {{research in the}} areas of business studies to economic geography on the topic of location decision (Anokhin & Wincent 2012). From the perspective of international business management, location decision is an important strategic decision as it involves a significant amount of resource commitment when investing in a particular region. Some researchers have also conducted studies on location avoidance {{to reduce the risk of}} wrong decisions (Schotter & Beamish 2013). The concept of location (i.e., why and where firms conduct business activities in a particular region) has been a topic of interest (see Alcacer & Chung 2007 Lorenen & Mudambi 2013). Since the 1920 s (Marshall 1920), topics such as economic agglomeration and location strategy have been examined from various perspectives. The growth of regions and economic development are also linked to external economies of scale when co-location is taken into consideration. Some studies have also taken a step further to examine co-located buyers and suppliers. According to Ganotakis & Love (2012), global actors (e.g., traders involved in trading activities, logistics service providers who provide logistics related supporting services, liner shipping companies that provide regular <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services,</b> terminal operators who handle containers and ships) who conduct their trading activities internationally have higher levels of growth and productivity.|$|R
40|$|Domestic <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> is {{critical}} to all aspects {{of life in the}} Pacific, providing access to markets and health and education services, as well as enabling cultural and social connectivity. Current <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> are entirely dependent upon use of increasingly expensive fossil fuels. Whilst there has been increasing research on international shipping, very little focus has been given to date to domestic shipping in the Pacific, and in particular at the local, village level. Recent studies have highlighted lack of data, particularly at a village level, as being a major impediment to progressing a shift to more sustainable transport. The importance of transport in achieving sustainable development and “green growth” is being increasingly highlighted by Pacific Leaders as a key priority, and particularly the need to find alternatives to reduce the region’s crippling dependency on imported fossil fuels. Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in other regions also face similar challenges. This paper provides a summary of the findings of a village-based assessment of transport and fossil fuel use in Solodamu village, Kadavu, Fiji carried out in 2009 and 2011. The objectives of the surveys were to gauge the overall sea, land and air transport use by the village and the fossil fuel footprint of the village by collecting data on a household by household basis. We then go on to outline how this assessment methodology has been expanded for an island group and highlight the potential of using this in other SIDS, so building the data sets available for more accurate analysis of both transport need and fossil fuel use to better address the issues of fossil fuel dependency and sustainable transport for the Pacific. ...|$|R
