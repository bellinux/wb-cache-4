50|$|The group {{participated in}} AFSWC Development Directorate {{investigated}} {{projects such as}} adding a parachute to a bomb to delay delivery, which allowed for the combat crew to release the bomb and escape before it exploded. The goal {{of one of the}} early lay-down projects was to determine the feasibility of delivering a parachute-retarded thermonuclear weapon weighing more than 40,000 pounds, the heaviest nuclear weapons in the stockpile, from altitudes exceeding 40,000 feet. One early effort was the development of a system that could retard the fall of either a TX-14 or a TX-16 weapon, heavy airburst bombs, from altitudes of 40,000 feet to 4,000 feet in 167 seconds from a B-36 Peacemaker.In 1956, however, AFSWC was directed to establish a permanent USAF Air Task Group for atmospheric tests. Thus, in 1956, the 4950th Test Group (Nuclear) was created, holding equal stature to the 4925th Test Group (Atomic). At that point, the atmospheric test participation of the 4925th Test Group (Atomic) was cut back and the group focused on the aircraft/weapon marriage mission.

5000|$|The trusses are the {{defining}} {{feature of the}} bridge. Two 198 ft through-trusses with eight panels on each side and one 120 ft through-truss with six panels on each side form {{the body of the}} bridge. The arc of the truss consists of steel beams connected to one another by [...] "batten plates" [...] (single-piece, flat, cast steel plates). The chords (the vertical and sloping beams) fit within a flange (a U-shaped, single-piece, cast steel plate) which is battened to the arc of the truss. The portal braces (the criss-crossing small beams that form a box hanging from the [...] "roof" [...] of the truss) are fastened to the truss with gusset plates. The horizontal struts at the top of each portal brace is made of [...] "laced" [...] steel (beams with holes in it), since the struts are in tension (being pulled apart) rather than compression (crushed from the ends). This allows them to be lighter and save weight. The <b>sway</b> <b>braces</b> (criss-crossing beams perpendicular to the portal braces) are attached to the truss with gusset plates, and bolted to one another at midpoint.

50|$|Because of {{the long}} spans and heavily trafficked {{shipping}} channel, a cantilever construction was deemed most suitable; a draw span was rejected {{because it would have}} to be opened too often. Consequently, the 793 ft main span has 145 ft of vertical clearance and is part of a 1708 ft long steel cantilever span. Overall length, including the concrete approach spans is 5305 ft. The approach spans are concrete arches more typical of McCullough's designs. The main roadway is 27 ft wide with 3.5 ft wide sidewalks on either side. The main towers rise 280 ft above the water surface, with curved <b>sway</b> <b>bracing</b> in a Gothic arch style. The open-spandrel concrete approach arches vary in span from 265 ft to 151 ft. The ends of the bridge are marked by pedestrian plazas meant to provide a viewing point for the bridge and to provide access to the shoreline. These plazas are detailed with Art Moderne motifs and are provided with built-in benches. The stairs are descend in sweeping curves to the park below.|$|R
50|$|The Dodd Ford Bridge {{is one of}} {{only two}} {{surviving}} bridges known to have been built by Johnson while he operated as a contractor under his own name. In its design and engineering it is a conventional, pin-connected, nine-panel, 148.5 ft, steel truss of the overhead Pratt variety. During {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries, this general type of truss was commonly used throughout the United States for highway crossings of approximately 90 to 150 feet in length. Reflecting the prevailing bridge-engineering practices of its time, this bridge has relatively light construction by later automobile-inspired standards. The bridge employs laced channel sections for vertical compression members, paired eyebars for horizontal tension members and lower chord members, angle sections for overhead <b>sway</b> <b>bracing</b> and portal bracing, and crossed eyebars for top-lateral and bottom-lateral bracing. The bridge further evokes its period by virtue of its narrow 15 ft roadway with a plank deck supported on wood stringers. Such design was later prohibited by the Minnesota Highway Commission (established in 1905). The Commission advocated a 16-foot minimum roadway, steel stringers, and preferred a reinforced-concrete deck.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} both {{analytical}} and design {{studies have been}} conducted on the behaviour of fully and semi-rigidly connected multistorey steel frames. Many topics have been addressed, current design approaches examined and new design methods proposed to allow for such effects based upon a first order linear elastic analysis, which is the most commonly used in normal design. These topics are as follows: 1) The well known amplified sway method (see BS 5950 : 1985 : Part 1) which can be used to incorporate the effect of the presence of axial loads on the behaviour of sway frames was studied. A modification to this method has been proposed and the validity of the proposed method was checked using an existing computer program [1] to verify the proposed method against a second order analysis. 2) The influence of the action of semi-rigid connections on frame behaviour was examined and the need to conduct a systematic investigation into the problem verified. A simple hand calculation method to incorporate this influence to any of the conventional design methods has been proposed. A second computer program [2] was slightly modified to suit the university of Sheffield IBM 3083 mainframe machine and this program was later used in this study. 3) The stiffening effect due to partial <b>sway</b> <b>bracing</b> resulting from the presence of block or brickwork walls in a practical multistorey frame accompanied by the weakening effect due to the finite stiffness of semi-rigid joints on frame serviceability was investigated and a suitable design method is recommended. 4) The behaviour of columns in sway frames with and without partial <b>sway</b> <b>bracing,</b> resulting from the presence of infill panels in practical frames, has been examined. Design charts which can be used to predict a reasonably conservative estimation of the inelastic ultimate load of a framed column in a sway structure are given. These charts are particularly helpful in assisting a designer to make a reasonably good initial selection for the column section sizes in a flexibly connected frame. In addition an empirical formula has been proposed to incorporate the beneficial effect on the column behaviour resulting from the presence of infill panels in real steel frames. In order to conduct this study a computer program developed by Rifai [3] has been modified to simulate the behaviour of a flexibly connected sway subassemblages. 5) Finally general conclusions and recommendations for future work are given...|$|R

The main aim of the paper is to extend the approximate storey magnifier approach to account for such a transition. The key to this is in the manner local second order effects are reflected. A high order shear relationship is proposed, and general sway magnifier, critical load and effective length formulations are presented both in terms of first order lateral storey stiffness and critical, free-sway column loads.

5000|$|The key {{elements}} of the scaffolding are the standard, ledger and transoms. The standards, also called uprights, are the vertical tubes that transfer the entire mass of the structure to the ground where they rest on a square base plate to spread the load. The base plate has a shank in its centre to hold the tube and is sometimes pinned to a sole board. Ledgers are horizontal tubes which connect between the standards. Transoms rest upon the ledgers at right angles. Main transoms are placed next to the standards, they hold the standards in place and provide support for boards; intermediate transoms are those placed between the main transoms to provide extra support for boards. In Canada this style {{is referred to as}} [...] "English". [...] "American" [...] has the transoms attached to the standards and is used less but has certain advantages in some situations. Since scaffolding is a physical structure, it is possible to go in and come out of scaffolding.As well as the tubes at right angles there are cross braces to increase rigidity, these are placed diagonally from ledger to ledger, next to the standards to which they are fitted. If the braces are fitted to the ledgers they are called ledger <b>braces.</b> To limit <b>sway</b> a facade <b>brace</b> is fitted to the face of the scaffold every 30 metres or so at an angle of 35°-55° running right from the base {{to the top of the}} scaffold and fixed at every level.|$|R
