Alessi started with producing a wide range of tableware items in nickel, chromium and <b>silver-plated</b> <b>brass.</b> The company’s intention was to produce hand-crafted items with the aid of machines. Design in the current sense of the term began when Carlo Alessi (born 1916), son of Giovanni, was named chief designer. Carlo was trained as an industrial designer. Between 1935 and 1945 he developed virtually all of the products Alessi produced. In 1945 he ascended to chief executive and designed the coffee service.|$|E
50|$|Badges {{were made}} of pressed steel, brass and zinc. All {{versions}} of the Wound Badge were worn on the lower left breast of the uniform or tunic.

At first, the Wound Badge in Black was stamped from sheet brass, painted semi-matte black with a hollow reverse pin back attachment or of solid construction. From 1942, steel was {{used to make the}} badges. The Wound Badge in silver was made (before 1942) from <b>silver-plated</b> <b>brass,</b> and (after 1942) from lacquered zinc, and had a solid reverse with either a needle pin or a broad flat pin bar. The Wound Badge in Gold was a gilded version of the Wound Badge in Silver.

The minting of coins recommenced in 2007 with 1000 $30 coins in [...]999 fine gold-plated brass to celebrate the 60th wedding anniversary of Leonard and Shirley Casley, a $5 nickel-plated zinc alloy [...] "Lest We Forget" [...] coin, and a set depicting the armorial bearings of Casley and his four sons, a $10 coin for Casley and $5 coins for his sons all minted in nickel-plated, zinc alloy.

5000|$|Yad - The pointer {{used by the}} Torah {{reader to}} keep one's place {{is known as a}} [...] "yad," [...] in Hebrew, or [...] "hand" [...] in English, in Ashkenazi {{communities}} and as the [...] "moreh" [...] or [...] "pointer/teacher" [...] or [...] "Kulmus" [...] or [...] "quill" [...] in Sephardi and Eastern communities. The pointer was originally a narrow rod, tapered at the pointing end, usually with a hole at the other end through which a ring or chain could be passed to hang the pointer on the Torah scroll. Now it looks like a hand with one finger pointing out. This is used so that no hands touch the actual scroll and transfer oils or dirt. Pointers are made for the most part of silver or <b>silver-plated</b> <b>brass,</b> but in a few European communities, they used to be made of wood. In such cases, the pointers were carved in the local folk-art style.|$|E
