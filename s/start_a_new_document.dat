50|$|The {{addition}} of styles and style libraries in WP 5.0 provided greatly increased power and flexibility in formatting documents, {{while maintaining the}} streaming-code architecture of earlier versions. Styles are a preset arrangement of settings {{having to do with}} things like fonts, spacings, tab stops, margins and other items having to do with text layout. Styles can be created by the user to shortcut the setup time when <b>starting</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>document,</b> and they can be saved in the program's style library. Prior to that, WordPerfect's only use of styles was the Opening Style, which contained the default settings for a document.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a {{document}} flow supervised segmentation approach applied to real world heterogeneous documents. Our algorithm treats the flow of documents as couples of consecutive pages and studies the relationship that exists between them. At first, sets of features are extracted from the pages where we propose an approach to model the couple of pages into a single feature vector representation. This representation will be provided to a binary classifier which classifies the relationship as either segmentation or continuity. In case of segmentation, we consider that we have a complete document and the analysis of the flow continues by <b>starting</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>document.</b> In case of continuity, the couple of pages are assimilated to the same document and the analysis continues on the flow. If there is an uncertainty on whether the relationship between the couple of pages should be classified as a continuity or segmentation, a rejection is decided and the pages analyzed until this point are considered as a "fragment". The first classification already provides good results approaching 90 % on certain documents, which is high at this level of the system...|$|R

40|$|The {{technological}} pluralism is {{an important}} challenge of the twenty-first century. A template is a computer document which has a basic format. It can be used many different times. A template is also a system that helps the source to arrange information on a computerscreen. Most web pages on web sites are based on template which is a file that serves as <b>a</b> <b>starting</b> point for <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>document.</b> The television templates also consist of interesting page transitions, easy-to-use content management systems, drop down menus, photo galleries, custom fonts, full screen background images, contact us forms, Google maps, social networking icons, rollover effects, photo galleries and so on. The users can click the link, and the item content displays {{within the context of}} its associated Portal Template. The portal templates for items are created through the same wizard that is used for creating Portal Templates for pages. The television templates are designed to deliver video but are equally suitable for photos or other multimedia. The television templates also offer a thoughtful arrangement of elements and color, fonts, effects, style, and layout to your plain slides via our templates. The television news channels adopt the new innovative customization of TV template evaluated by channels. The television templates facilitate better understanding and appreciation of the product and project requirements among the audience. The television templates basically include website templates, flash templates, e-commerce templates, Facebook templates, responsive templates and other templates which include amazing features...|$|R
