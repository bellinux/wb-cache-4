25|$|According to Polyaenus, when Artemisia <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> near to {{falling into}} the hands of the Greeks, she ordered the Persian colours to be taken down, and the master of the ship to bear down upon and attack a Persian vessel of the Calyndian allies, which was {{commanded}} by Damasithymus, that was passing by her.|$|E
500|$|Froissart {{writes of}} the meeting in his Chronicles, saying that Isabeau stood {{motionless}} while being inspected, exhibiting perfect behavior {{by the standards of}} her time. Arrangements were made for the two to be married in Arras, but on the first meeting Charles felt [...] "happiness and love enter his heart, for he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> beautiful and young, and thus he greatly desired to gaze at her and possess her". She did not yet speak French and may not have reflected the idealized beauty of the period, perhaps inheriting her mother's dark Italian features, then unfashionable, but Charles most certainly approved of her because the couple were married three days later. Froissart documented the royal wedding, joking about the lascivious guests at the feast and the [...] "hot young couple".|$|E
2500|$|In 1983, Rebecca Welles {{arranged}} {{to see her}} mother {{for the first time}} in seven years. Speaking to his lifelong friend Roger Hill, Orson Welles expressed his concern about the visit's effect on his daughter. [...] "Rita barely knows me now," [...] Welles said. He recalled seeing Hayworth three years before at an event which the Reagans held for Frank Sinatra. [...] "When it was over, I came over to her table and I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> very beautiful, very reposed looking, and didn't know me at first. After about four minutes of speaking, I could see that she realized who I was, and she began to cry quietly." ...|$|E

60|$|Then Charmion {{drew near}} me, and I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she,</b> too, <b>was</b> weeping.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not. She came to {{ask about}} her poor father, and I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> far too young to think of falling in love at all. What I said was that I have fallen hopelessly in love, and that as I cannot hope <b>that</b> <b>she</b> will ever be--be mine, I have {{made up my mind}} to love her hopelessly, but loyally, to the end of life, and serve or die for her if need be." ...|$|R
2500|$|When Stirling {{first saw}} Congress he sailed towards her, {{in the hope}} that she was a {{privateer}} of twenty 9-pounder guns that had been raiding in the area. However, when he got closer and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> significantly stronger even than the privateer he thought she might be, Stirling attempted an escape. However, by 10:30 am the Americans came within range and opened fire with their bow chasers. By 11:00 Congress had closed the distance and her crew engaged with muskets and pistols, to which the British replied with [...] "energy". At this point Captain Geddes observed that his ship was faster than that of the enemy so he maneuvered ahead of Savage until almost abreast, in preparation for a broadside.|$|E
60|$|Then he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> crying, and he {{repeated}} his question.|$|E
60|$|He <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> in earnest, and {{suppressed}} all {{semblance of}} a smile.|$|E
60|$|But one day {{his nephew}} {{suddenly}} reappeared. Jessamine {{opened the door}} for him, and her face lighted up, but Mr. Bell <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> crying.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Duncan {{had been}} {{standing}} before the window {{with her back to}} the room when Ernest entered. When <b>she</b> turned he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> crying.|$|R
60|$|She {{followed}} his suggestion, but very awkwardly, and he <b>saw</b> plainly <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> tired. Instead of approaching the shore, the boat continued to float down the lake.|$|R
60|$|He {{gripped her}} gloved fingers, brushed past her, and she <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> alone.|$|E
60|$|So {{when she}} <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> steadfastly minded {{to go to}} her, she left {{speaking}} to her.|$|E
60|$|Nasmyth smiled. He <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{desirous of}} {{changing}} the subject and he was glad of it.|$|E
60|$|Then I rose {{up in my}} {{rage and}} cursed her heavily, for I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not stopped this woman's tongue would bring us all to ruin.|$|R
60|$|Hawtrey, who <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> meant it--which <b>was</b> a {{cause of}} some astonishment to him--dropped his hand.|$|R
6000|$|Nasmyth made a {{whimsical}} gesture as he answered her, for he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could <b>be</b> fanciful, too. [...] "Unsubstantial moonlight, glamour, mystery--perhaps {{other things as}} well," [...] he said. [...] "If you are curious, why shouldn't we go and see?" ...|$|R
60|$|Corey {{looked at}} her, and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> shorter than her sister, {{and had a}} dark complexion.|$|E
60|$|Kermode <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> suspicious, {{and thought}} her too {{intelligent}} {{to be put}} off with an excuse.|$|E
60|$|He <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> bitterly disappointed, {{and sought}} for {{a means of}} {{tempering}} the cruelty of the blow.|$|E
60|$|From {{her work}} and from her {{association}} with women who had organized suffrage associations in hostile cities, or had defended political prisoners, she caught something of an impersonal attitude; <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> as touchily personal as Maud Dyer.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Renshaw did {{not like}} leaving Wilfrid alone; but <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could <b>be</b> of no real {{assistance}} to him, and her aid was absolutely required to carry the wounded man. She therefore offered no objections to the proposal.|$|R
6000|$|Thatcher <b>saw</b> only <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> pained, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> helpless: <b>that</b> was enough. [...] "It is {{possible}} that your uncle may have been deceived," [...] he began; [...] "many honest men have been fooled by clever but deceitful tricksters, men and women--" ...|$|R
60|$|His round {{eyes grew}} rounder still, and his brow {{puckered}} in dismay as he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> angry.|$|E
60|$|Still {{the steamer}} went on, until {{presently}} they heard her siren going, and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> putting about.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} me, and I <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{putting in a}} bit of the old drenched-irises stuff.|$|E
60|$|Jane Clayton {{sprang to}} her feet and looked about for Schneider, only to see him {{standing}} behind the newcomers, a grin upon his face. At his side stood Schmidt. Instantly <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> made the victim of a plot.|$|R
60|$|It was delightful, {{and just}} what Maggie expected--the gipsy <b>saw</b> at once <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a little lady.|$|R
60|$|She ran upstairs at {{once and}} joined him. He seemed {{relieved}} when he saw her, but scrutinised her face keenly. He <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> in some concern, so led her over to the sofa in the window and sat down beside her.|$|R
60|$|Elsie {{looked at}} Andrew and he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> grateful; but Staffer came across {{to where he}} sat.|$|E
60|$|The little model's face {{remained}} impassive, but by {{the movement}} of her fingers Hilary <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> attending now.|$|E
60|$|To his {{surprise}} he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> crying. He had a tender heart, and hated {{to see anyone}} miserable.|$|E
60|$|For a while I stood amazed with horror, {{staring down}} at the dead face of my beloved mother. Then I stooped to lift her and <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had <b>been</b> stabbed, and through the breast, stabbed with the sword which I carried in my hand.|$|R
60|$|I <b>saw</b> at once <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{a fashionable}} girl, from her using the French {{language}} in this way.|$|R
60|$|The {{cigarette}} {{dropped from}} her fingers; she sat up. Then he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> too <b>was</b> agitated. There {{was an unusual}} spot of colour in her cheeks, her breathing was certainly less regular. The variance from her habitual placidity encouraged him. He scarcely hesitated for a moment.|$|R
