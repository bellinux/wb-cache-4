40|$|Bank {{exchange}} processes within 50 m of the Tambo River, southeast Australia, {{have been}} investigated through the combined use of 3 H and 14 C. Groundwater residence times increase towards the Tambo River, which suggests the absence of significant bank storage. Major ion concentrations and δ 2 H and δ 18 O values of bank water also indicate that bank infiltration does not significantly impact groundwater chemistry under baseflow and post-flood conditions, suggesting that the gaining nature of the river may be driving the return of bank storage water back into the Tambo River within days of peak flood conditions. The covariance between 3 H and 14 C indicates the leakage and mixing between old (~ 17 200 years) groundwater from a <b>semi-confined</b> <b>aquifer</b> and younger groundwater (< 100 years) near the river, where confining layers are less prevalent. It {{is likely that the}} upward infiltration of deeper groundwater from the <b>semi-confined</b> <b>aquifer</b> during flooding limits bank infiltration. Furthermore, the more saline deeper groundwater likely controls the geochemistry of water in the river bank, minimising the chemical impact that bank infiltration has in this setting. These processes, coupled with the strongly gaining nature of the Tambo River are likely to be the factors reducing the chemical impact of bank storage in this setting.

The system consists of an unconfined aquifer, a <b>semi-confined</b> <b>aquifer</b> and a semi-permeable confining unit between them. An exact analytical solution is derived to investigate the influences of both leakage and storage of the semi-permeable layer on the tide-induced groundwater-head fluctuation in the <b>semi-confined</b> <b>aquifer.</b> This solution is a generalization of the solution obtained by Jiao and Tang (Water Resource Research 35 (1999) 747 - 751) which ignored the storage of the semi-confining unit. The analytical solution indicates that both storage and leakage of the semi-permeable layer {{play an important role}} in the groundwater-head fluctuation in the confined aquifer. While leakage is generally more important than storage, the impact of storage on groundwater-head fluctuations changes with leakage. With the increase of leakage the fluctuation of groundwater-head in the confined aquifer will be controlled mainly by leakage. The study also demonstrates that the influence of storativity of the semi-permeable layer on groundwater-head fluctuation is negligible only when the storativity of the semi-permeable layer is comparable to or smaller than that of the confined aquifer. However, for aquifer systems with semi-permeable layer composed of thick, soft sedimentary materials, the storativity of the semi-permeable layer is usually much greater than that of the aquifer and its influence should be considered. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|This project {{involved}} {{investigation of}} the tidal analysis technique, defined by Ferris (1951), for determining the aquifer properties of permeability, storage and leakage. The approach included laboratory experimental work using a physical model of a <b>semi-confined</b> <b>aquifer.</b> In addition, field work was undertaken to record groundwater levels in a coastal aquifer. The laboratory work concluded with results of amplitude decay and time lag. Numerical analysis illustrated the significant effects of reflection and leakage {{on the results of}} amplitude decay and time lag. Therefore, Ferris' theory was advanced to incorporate both reflection from an impermeable boundary and leakage. This theory was applied to the laboratory results, to conclude an estimate for the coefficient of permeability of 8 x 10 (^- 3) m/s. In addition, a range of values for the leakage coefficient were evaluated: 0 to 4 x 10 (^- 5) s(^- 1). These values compared well with earlier work using the Durham Model Aquifer where similar results were obtained. Ferris' theory was applied to the field data for instances where tidal influence on groundwater behaviour was observed. Estimates for aquifer properties based on the tidal technique compared well with those based on soil grading methods. The analytical theory, developed within this programme of work, incorporated three unknown parameters, transmissivity, storage and leakage. The value of one of these parameters must be assumed in order to then compute estimates for the remaining two aquifer properties. When a <b>semi-confined</b> <b>aquifer</b> is under investigation, application of this theory provides increased accuracy for the estimates of aquifer properties when compared with results based on Ferris' equations. Tidal analysis incorporates the heterogeneity of the aquifer over a wider area than alternative methods available for determining aquifer properties.

40|$|AbstractBandung {{groundwater}} basin (GWB) {{is now in}} the serious crisis. It is basically composed of three aquifers, i. e. : (1) the uppermost unconfined aquifer, (2) the middle <b>semi-confined</b> <b>aquifer</b> and (3) the lower <b>semi-confined</b> <b>aquifer.</b> The groundwater (GW) crisis is due to over-exploitation especially from the middle <b>semi-confined</b> <b>aquifer.</b> In order to address the condition of GW resources in the region, estimation of GW recharge and GW build up are very important. This may help the GW management to overcome the present GW crisis. This paper will be devoted to share about the estimation of GW recharge and GW build up in the Bandung GWB contributed from direct rain water infiltration and inter-aquifer transfer that have been assessed by means of GW modeling. The 1 st recharge can be assossiated with the vertical GW movement in the unsaturated zone, while the 2 nd recharge was considered to be related with the GW flow in saturated intermediate to regional flow. The 1 st recharge generally occures in the topographical high surrounding the Bandung basin, while the 2 nd type can be predicted to occur along the GW flow path, i. e in the topographical high {{as well as in the}} regional GW flow. The 1 st recharge would result in shallow GW system in the uppermost unconfined aquifer, while the 2 nd recharge will result in the leakage into the middle semi- confined aquifer that is the most critical aquifer in the Bandung GWB. The conceptual model of natural recharge mechanism in the Bandung GWB was based on the model of natural recharge in the mountain front basin from Wilson (1980). The GW recharge and build up can be approached using GW modeling. The 1 st component has been estimated based on 1 D model of Richards (1931), whereas the estimation of 2 nd component has been carried out based on aquifer leakage phanomen on the general 3 D aquifer leakage model of Widodo et al (1999). Regional transfer between aquifers was performed by means of GW zone budgeting. Direct infiltration of rain water in Bandung GWB was estimated 5 % of precipitation in the Bandung basin that builds up around 4. 6 m 3 /sec additional GW. KBU is the most favourable GW recharge zone in Bandung GWB and contributes 2. 6 m 3 /sec (57 %) natural GW recharge, from KBS 1. 5 m 3 /sec (32 %) and from KBT 0. 5 m 3 /sec (11 %). In KBU the recharge zone was predicted at topographic level between 1000 and 1300 msl.

Borehole hydrograph analysis provides an independent methodology to map recharge zones, access aquifer connectivity, and delineate areas of groundwater mining or recovery. The impact of historical groundwater extractions and current water sharing plans can then be analysed {{in the context of the}} mapped aquifer connectivity. The major goals of the 3 D hydrograph analysis are to: •map hydraulic connectivity throughout the alluvial sequence,•develop a 3 D conceptual site model,•examine the long-term impact of irrigation extractions,•compare zones of declining groundwater head to the connectivity interpretation, and•examine the changes in groundwater head since the introduction of the water sharing plan. This 3 D borehole hydrograph spatial and temporal analysis shows that the largest zones of decline in the Namoi Catchment correspond to <b>semi-confined</b> <b>aquifers</b> with low connectivity to the unconfined aquifer and thus recharge from streams, floods, diffuse rainfall or irrigation deep drainage. 3 D hydrograph analysis of pumping induced groundwater head fluctuation maps unconfined and <b>semi-confined</b> <b>aquifers.</b> It also delineates palaeochannels.

40|$|Abstract The Pimpama {{coastal plain}} is {{situated}} in southern Moreton Bay, in subtropical eastern Australia. The plain is low lying and tidal and is situated behind a large sand barrier island. Largely due to recent (30 years) drainage networks within the flood plain, surface water quality has declined. Groundwater hydrographs have enabled the determination of different flow systems: a deeper system responding to seasonal weather patterns and a shallower flow system more responsive to individual rainfall events. Elevated potentiometric heads in <b>semi-confined</b> <b>aquifers</b> reflect upward movement of saline to hypersaline groundwaters. However, interaction of this deeper groundwater with shallower groundwater and the surface drains {{is yet to be}} determined. Recharge to the shallower system is by direct infiltration while recharge to the deeper system includes a component from landward ranges or bedrock outcrops within the plain. Discrimination between groundwater bodies is possible using salinity, ionic ratios and stable isotopes.

The monthly monitoring of water levels {{proves that the}} lagoon drains phreatic aquifers which in turn contribute to recharge the underlying <b>semi-confined</b> <b>aquifers.</b> Besides rainwater, four types of natural waters contribute for the water balance and water quality in the lagoon: (1) the Cértima River with a Ca–HCO 3 water type and circum neutral pH; (2) the Cretaceous aquifers with a Na–Cl–HCO 3 water type and acidic pH; (3) the Triassic aquifers with a mixed water type, and slightly alkaline pH; and, (4) under certain conditions, the Águeda River with a diluted Na–Cl water type. Calculation of the water budget of the lagoon was developed with a lumped parameter model earlier proposed. The results of the lumped parameter model show that subsurface lateral flow is an important contributor to surface water bodies when compared to aquifer discharge. Albeit the lagoon drains impacted aquifers with high nitrate content, surface water bodies revealed low nitrate content {{throughout most of the}} 1 -year monitoring period. The low nitrate content in the lagoon reflects a natural attenuation capacity that ranges between 8 % and 13 % which is mainly attributed to biogeochemical processes occurring in the hyporheic and riparian zones associated to the lagoon...|$|R
40|$|Depth-to-water {{measurements}} from 181 monitoring {{wells in}} unconfined or <b>semi-confined</b> <b>aquifers</b> in nine {{regions of the}} central and northeastern U. S. were analyzed. Groundwater storage exhibited strong seasonal variations in all regions, with peaks in spring and lows in autumn, and its interannual variability was nearly unbounded, such that the impacts of droughts, floods, and excessive pumping could persist for many years. We found that the spatial variability of groundwater storage anomalies (deviations from the long term mean) increases as a power function of extent scale (square root of area). That relationship, which is linear on a log-log graph, is common to other hydrological variables but {{had never before been}} shown with groundwater data. We describe how the derived power function can be used to determine the number of wells needed to estimate regional mean groundwater storage anomalies with a desired level of accuracy, or to assess uncertainty in regional mean estimates from a set number of observations. We found that the spatial variability of groundwater storage anomalies within a region often increases with the absolute value of the regional mean anomaly, the opposite of the relationship between soil moisture spatial variability and mean. Recharge (drainage from the lowest model soil layer) simulated by the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model was compatible with observed monthly groundwater storage anomalies and month-to-month changes in groundwater storage...|$|R
