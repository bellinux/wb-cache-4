5|$|After the Caribbean duty she was {{transferred}} to Western Local Escort Force for duty between New York City and St. John's, Newfoundland. Fredericton came close to seeing action when she was assigned to convoy HX229 on 8 March 1943, but <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> at St. John's on 14 March. Two days later the convoy was attacked by a wolfpack of nearly 40 U-boats, {{which resulted in the}} sinking of 22 ships.|$|E
25|$|The {{day of the}} murder, an {{eyewitness}} came forward and told investigators that she allegedly saw {{the two young men}} involved in Bermúdez Zacarías' murder. She said that the two men were of slim complexion and may have been 24–25 years old; according to her description, one was fully dressed in black and that the other had dark pants and a white sweater. The woman saw them as she was driving through the street where Bermúdez Zacarías was murdered. When she first saw the two men, she did not think they were suspicious because she thought they were construction workers from a nearby site. As she was driving down the street, she saw Bermúdez Zacarías on the road and thought that he had fainted. When she got close to the body, she noticed a pool of blood. <b>She</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> to look at the two men, who kept walking down the street in an opposite direction.|$|E
500|$|Cöln steamed to aid {{her sister}} Mainz, which was under heavy fire from several British cruisers and battlecruisers. At around 13:25, she {{came upon the}} damaged cruiser [...] and several destroyers. Cöln engaged the British ships briefly, but was {{interrupted}} {{by the appearance of}} the British battlecruisers. At 13:37, Cöln made a 16-point turn and returned fire at the battlecruisers; the British ships turned to port to steam closer to Cöln, which in turn similarly altered course to escape. She was hit several times, however, including one hit that killed Maass. At 13:56, another German cruiser arrived on the scene, which distracted the British ships and allowed Cöln to slip away to the north. About fifteen minutes later, <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> south-east to return to port.|$|E

50|$|Accidentally one day Sagara {{comes on}} to {{land from the}} water and loses her mermaid body. <b>She</b> <b>turns</b> {{out to be a}} {{beautiful}} woman. Whenever water is spilled over her, however, <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> into a mermaid.|$|R

500|$|The {{cabin crew}} started the evacuation, {{even before the}} plane {{had come to a}} halt, via both forward galley doors, both rear doors and the {{starboard}} overwing exits. Eighteen passengers escaped via the overwing exits before the fire grew too intense to use that route. The forward port galley door escape slide caught fire before it could be used, but one person jumped from there. 84 people escaped via the starboard galley door. Three of the crew escaped by the emergency cockpit rope. The rear starboard door escape slide had twisted on deployment, so Steward Taylor climbed down to straighten it, leaving stewardess Jane Harrison at the door assisting the passengers. Six passengers escaped via this route before the slide was punctured and deflated. Harrison encouraged the passengers to jump, and pushed out those too frightened to do so. 11 people escaped via this route, and five more escaped via the rear port door before the slide was destroyed. Harrison was last seen alive preparing to jump herself, but then <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> and disappeared into the burning fuselage in an attempt to save the remaining four female passengers, including a disabled woman and eight-year-old girl. It was these actions which led to the award of the George Cross posthumously [...] to Harrison in recognition of her selfless gallantry. 35 people were injured, and five killed.|$|E

Immediately after, their sonar detected noises of a foreign submarine close by. Before clearing the area, Grayling checked that the Russian submarine had not sustained serious damage.|$|E
2500|$|The ancient Law of Moses (the Torah) forbids {{men from}} lying with men (i.e., from having intercourse) in Leviticus 18 {{and gives a}} story of {{attempted}} homosexual rape in Genesis 19, {{in the story of}} Sodom and Gomorrah, after which the cities were soon destroyed with [...] "brimstone and fire, from the Lord" [...] and the death penalty was prescribed to its inhabitants and to Lot's wife who was tuned into a pillar of salt because <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> to watch the cities' destruction. In Deuteronomy 22:5, cross-dressing is condemned as [...] "abominable".|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> her <b>back</b> to him {{and stood}} looking at the fire again.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>turned</b> her <b>back</b> upon him, and, without reply, {{sat down}} before her glass.|$|R

50|$|Elizabeth now {{feels she}} has finally repaid Frail in full. Rune slips the noose off, and Elizabeth turns to walk away.

50|$|A {{poor woman}} finds a {{pot on the}} road. She thinks it must have a hole {{for it to be}} discarded, but optimistically decides she might find a use for it as a flowerpot. Looking inside she discovers it is full of gold pieces, and decides to drag it home in her shawl. She drags it for a while, but when she looks back, the pot has become a lump of silver. She decides this is better than gold, as it is less likely to be stolen, and goes on. After a time <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> again, to find the silver has turned into a chunk of iron. She observes this will be easier to sell, and that the penny pieces it will bring would be safer than either gold or silver. She goes on again, and when <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> a third time, the iron has become a rock. She exclaims how {{convenient}} this will be as a doorstop, and happily goes home.|$|R

60|$|The {{young girl}} hesitated. The man's tone was surly, and yet {{indicated}} {{a certain kind}} of half-pathetic grievance. HER curiosity got the better of her prudence, and <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Mary's {{statement}} echoes {{her earlier}} words to Apostle Peter in John 20:2: [...] "They have taken away the Lord {{out of the}} tomb, and we know not where they have laid him", signifying that she {{was unaware of the}} resurrection. This is confirmed a third time immediately thereafter in John 20:14-15, when <b>she</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> and sees Jesus without recognizing him, and assumes him to be the gardener.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Boyne," [...] {{said his}} mother, [...] "sometimes I think you're almost a fool!" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>turned</b> her <b>back</b> upon {{her son and}} left him.|$|R
