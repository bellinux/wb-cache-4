40|$|The {{economic}} crisis has exposed <b>shortcomings</b> <b>in</b> <b>standard</b> economic theory and provided an impetus for new economic thinking. But the theoretical {{debate in the}} wake of the crisis has been unduly constrained by the terms of the mainstream approach to economic theory. Like any approach, it is characterised by a way of framing reality, giving meaning to terms and setting criteria for good argument. It also determines how any economic theory is understood, whether from the history of economic thought or from the contemporary literature. But there are other approaches to economics which would open up the field to a much wider range of possibilities for new economic thinking. Addressing the challenge that any reader bases her understanding on her own approach, the purpose of this paper is to attempt to explain what it means to consider different approaches and why it matters for policy. This is done by discussing two features of the financial crisis which pose particular problems for economic theory. These are the role of changing market sentiment in driving asset prices on the one hand and the breakdown of trust relationships in banking on the other (the moral hazard issue). We will see how these are addressed by mainstream theory and by alternative approaches. First, market sentiment is discussed within the mainstream rational-optimising framework, where risk is quantifiable, and compared with the Keynesian approach based on the general uncertainty of knowledge, where reason, evidence and sentiment are integrated. The moral hazard issue is then discussed in its mainstream form in terms of rational opportunism and in its institutionalist form in terms of the foundation of social relations (including relations between institutions) in trust. It is shown that different ways of approaching theorising in each case imply different policy measures. It is argued further that an exclusively deductive mathematical approach to analysis of market sentiment and trust is unduly limiting and that a more pluralist approach would more fully address the issues...|$|R

40|$|As humans we find {{communicating}} {{natural and}} compelling. Over the centuries {{we have created}} many innovations which enable and improve communication between people; {{during the past decade}} mobile phone networks have brought about a technological revolution in this area. Never before have people been so connected to one another. Today {{we have the ability to}} communicate with almost anyone, anytime, anywhere. Our increased connectivity and reachability also leads to new issues and challenges that we need to deal with. When we phone someone we expect an instant connection, and when this does not occur it can be frustrating. On the other hand it is equally disruptive to receive a call when one is busy with an important task or in a situation where communication is inappropriate. Social protocol dictates that we try to minimize such situations for the benefit of others nearby and for ourselves. This management of communications is a constant and difficult task. Using presence – which signals a person’s availability and willingness to communicate – is a solution to this problem. Such information can benefit communication partners by increasing the likelihood of a successful connection and decreasing disruptions. This research addresses the problem of staying connected while keeping control over mobile communications. It adopts a design-science research paradigm, with the primary research artifact being a model for privacy-aware presence management in mobile communications. As part of the model development knowledge contributions are made in several ways. Existing knowledge about the problem area is extended through a quantitative analysis of mobile communications management. This analysis uses a novel survey, collecting useful empirical data for future research. This includes how people currently manage their communications and what features they expect from a potential “call management” system. The examination and use of presence standards, as a foundation for the model, provides a comparison of the main presence technologies available today. A focus on privacy features identifies several <b>shortcomings</b> <b>in</b> <b>standards</b> which, if addressed, can help to improve and make these standards more complete. The model stresses the privacy of potentially sensitive presence information. A unique perspective based on social relationship theories is adopted. The use of relationship groups not only makes logical sense but also assists in the management of presence information and extends existing standards. Finally, the evaluation of the model demonstrates the feasibility of a practical implementation as well the ability to extend the model in next generation mobile networks. Thus the model presents a solid foundation for the development of future services. In these ways the proposed model contributes positively towards balancing efficient mobile communications with the need for privacy-awarenes...|$|R
40|$|Background: Financial and nonfinancial {{conflicts}} of interest in medicine and surgery are troubling {{because they have the}} capacity to skew decision making in ways that might be detrimental to patient care and well-being. The recent case of the Articular Surface Replacement (ASR) hip provides a vivid illustration of the harmful effects of {{conflicts of}} interest in surgery. Discussion. We identify financial and nonfinancial {{conflicts of interest}} experienced by surgeons, hospitals and regulators in the ASR case. These conflicts may have impacted surgical advice, decision-making and evidence gathering with respect to the ASR prosthesis, and contributed to the significant harms experienced by patients in whom the hip was implanted. Drawing on this case we explore <b>shortcomings</b> <b>in</b> the <b>standard</b> responses to conflicts of interest - disclosure and recusal. We argue disclosure is necessary but by no means sufficient to address conflicts of interest. Using the concept of recusal we develop remedies including second opinions and third party consent which may be effective in mitigating conflicts, but their implementation introduces new challenges. Summary. Deployment of the ASR hip is a case of surgical innovation gone wrong. As we show, there were multiple conflicts of interest involved in the introduction of the ASR hip into practice and subsequent attempts to gloss over the mounting body of evidence about its lack of safety and effectiveness. Conflicts of interest in surgery are often not well managed. We suggest strategies in this paper which can minimise the conflicts of interest associated with surgical innovation. 9 page(s...|$|R

In this context, the ISA has to balance seabed mining with its mandate to protect and preserve the marine environment from harmful effect caused by mining operations. One potential tool to help strike this balance is adaptive management, which the ISA seeks to incorporate into its future regulatory framework. This article discusses some of the challenges to achieving adaptive management and demonstrates that the current regulatory options make it difficult, if not impossible, to achieve adaptive management. Adaptive management will require procedural mechanisms through which the ISA can adjust environmental standards continuously.

40|$|Visualization plays a {{key role}} in the concept of Lean. Lean was {{developed}} in Japan as a business philosophy in order to lead to an activity, where only steps that contribute to customer value of the final product are being performed. By defining the customer value and establish visualized standards, it is possible to see when situations differ from the standard. Then it’s possible to lead the process back on track. This approach generates an activity that evolves and improves its ability in meeting customer needs. And that has a great potential to make operations more profitable and competitive. Siemens Turbomachinery AB in Finspång manufactures complete power generation systems, based on the company’s own produced gas and steam turbines. The company has for years worked to establish a Lean-based thinking. The Procurement function, within the Supply Chain Management department (GP) is responsible for purchasing the supply system of the gas turbine and has since 2007 worked with visualization as a daily management tool. However, the existing concept fails when it comes to conveying a holistic approach from a given standard, and to support the daily work and to progress. The purpose of this thesis is to suggest a visualization concept for the Procurement function. The concept has to be developed and generate a result in line with the Lean work on SIT. Because of <b>shortcomings</b> <b>in</b> <b>standards</b> of the Procurement function, a significant part of the thesis was spent on the identification of the current status. The identification of the current status resulted in: A system description of Operational purchasing role in supply chain, the survey of the main activities as well as a visual process description containing the main process, and some of the deviations/wastages identified during the identification process. It has been found that the visualization methodology is inconsistent among GP’s groups. Because the final product is processed cross-functional, we believe that there should be greater focus on communication and on the comprehensive view that conveys the whole. Visualization of GP’s common leverabel can in that sense foster interaction and lead to even better results. The visualization concept was finally summarized into: Static goal images to promote employee commitment for the final product, of a group board to operate and develop the internal operations, and of a project board which aims to highlight the department's common leverabel. The concept is based on the Lean philosophy and has the potential to be introduced in other groups within GP. A prerequisite for the implementation of the boards is a clear division of responsibilities in which participation and individual responsibility is the most important. It’s preferable that the visualization concept continues to evolve, but it’s also important to avoid deviation from the proposed <b>standard</b> <b>in</b> order to counteract inconsistencies. The signal levels of the deliverables must be continuously updated through discussions with internal customers. This is to reflect the client's needs and gradually refine and improve the signal levels and hence the company's performanc...|$|R
40|$|Richard Wagner was a focal {{figure in}} the history of opera in the nineteenth century. Tristan und Isolde (1856 - 65) {{represents}} the quintessence of his mature style, retaining features of his earlier operas while introducing innovations in both theory (Wagner’s Oper und Drama had been published in 1851) and practice and achieving a true synthesis of words and music. As a work which changed the course of western art {{in the third quarter of}} the nineteenth century and exercised so potent an influence on succeeding generations of composers, it stands out as an ideal case study for closer scrutiny. In his multifarious role as a composer, conductor, theorist, writer and critic, Wagner recognised serious <b>shortcomings</b> <b>in</b> the <b>standards</b> of his contemporaries in reproducing the composer’s intentions, and he directed his efforts towards ‘decent and correct performances’ of his own dramatic works. Scornful of the prevailing attitudes in opera houses, he provided copiously detailed instructions for conductors, singers, instrumentalists, designers and producers, all of which reveal his views on turning theory into practice. This chapter explores the genesis of Tristan und Isolde, its performance history (in the Bayreuth Festspielhaus and elsewhere) and its critical reception, including the most prominent singers and conductors and the rich legacy of recordings. It focuses also on the revolutionary nature of Wagner’s demands on his interpreters. Among the numerous performance practice issues to be addressed are: vocal and instrumental techniques and playing styles, articulation, accent, expression, tempo and tempo modification, portamento, vibrato (vocal and instrumental), ornamentation, pitch, conducting, the constitution of the orchestra in the light of experiments with and the development of instruments, instrumentation, conventions of orchestral layout, set design, and aesthetic questions about the realization of Tristan und Isolde on the stage...|$|R

Did progress in the 2 ̆ 2 Nickel Belt 2 ̆ 2 rely on outside-directed staples exploitation, or did local initiative play any part? What sort of society emerged [...] urban or rural, chaotic or tranquil? Questions such as these guide this thesis, which adopts a narrative coverage of local events from prehistory to the Great Depression. Changes in the resource sectors, administration and society are emphasized, for these best reflect the successive stages of areal development from a Northern 2 ̆ 2 wilderness 2 ̆ 2 to a modern region.;This broad-ranging survey reveals both the strengths and <b>shortcomings</b> <b>in</b> the <b>standard</b> analysis of the resource frontier. According to these assessments, Canada 2 ̆ 7 s mid-north was home to a mainly urban population that was dependent on outside staples exploiters. Yet in the Nickel Belt a varied economy was highlighted by a farm sector which assumed proportions belying the area 2 ̆ 7 s supposed, mining-induced ecological devastation. Outside-sponsored mining and forestry also produced much local progress. Even the monopolization of the nickel industry brought more good than harm; though INCO showed scant sympathy for area residents, the day-to-day needs of a huge industry and the stability assured {{by the lack of}} competition were a great boon to the Nickel Belt. Aid from the senior governments resulted in yet more gains; the combination of public and private resources produced an economic and social infrastructure comparable to much older, more populated regions. Sudbury, because of its various advantages and despite the absence of mineral works, achieved local metropolitan status even as it fell into dependency on INCO. That centre 2 ̆ 7 s fate, and the less-heralded events across the Nickel Belt, show the merits of an intermingling of the metropolitan, staples and dependency approaches along lines which pay far greater heed to the real accomplishments, rather than the perceived costs, of Northern, resource-based development...|$|R
