40|$|In many {{industries}} like management consulting, IT consulting, or construction {{highly qualified}} employees, i. e., experts or executive managers, {{have to be}} assigned to temporary projects. In firms with many employees and various different projects, this assignment decision involves a complex optimization procedure. Obviously, the employees' productivities in the respective projects are crucial for the employer's optimal assignment decision, but assignment can also be affected by risk-incentive trade-offs. Moreover, taxation can alter the assignment decision, especially if employees are sent abroad as expatriates so that international tax law {{has to be taken}} into account. To address these issues simultaneously, we combine a human resource assignment problem with a principal-agent problem of the LEN type. Both wage taxation at the agents' level and corporate taxation at the principal's level are integrated. We show that national tax rules as well as the methods for avoiding double taxation and the agents' tax characteristics are important determinants for international assignment decisions. The effects of tax rate variations can be ambiguous and depend on whether the exemption method or the credit method are applied, in particular if agents make differing choices of residence. From a tax policy perspective, the exemption method should be preferred because the tax effects are more transparent than under the credit method. <b>Special</b> <b>deductions</b> for incoming expatriates have only little effects on the optimal assignment decision...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MComm) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2004. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Like {{any other}} item of expenditure, {{interest}} expenditure's deductibility {{is determined by}} subjecting it to the tests laid down in the general deduction formula contained in section 11 (a), together with section 23 (f) and 23 (g) of the Income Tax Act, {{as well as the}} <b>special</b> <b>deductions</b> applicable to interest. In this study there will be only concentrated on the tests laid down in the general deduction formula contained in section 11 (a), together with section 23 (f) and 23 (g) of the Income Tax Act. The general test according to section 11 (a) as laid down by the courts to ascertain if an expense incurred in trade is deductible, is firstly to ascertain the act entailing the expenditure. If it is performed for the purpose of earning income, the expenditure attendant upon is deductible. Secondly, the closeness of the connection between the expenditure incurred and the trade must be ascertained. If the expense incurred is so closely connected with the business operation that it may be regarded as part of the cost of performing it, the expenditure will be deductible. The courts have considered many factors to ascertain if interest expenditure complies with the statutory requirements as set out in section 11 (a), read together with section 23 (f) and 23 (g) of the Income Tax Act. There seems to be one test which can be applied to most of the statutory requirements and {{can be seen as the}} conclusive factor in determining the deductibility of interest expenses and that is the test of the original purpose of the loan that leads to the interest expense. Firstly in this study, the factors considered by the courts to ascertain if the deductibility of an interest expenditure complies with the statutory requirements as set out in the introduction of section 11 (a), together with section 23 (f) and 23 (g), will be examined with specific reference to the purpose of the loan. Then the possibility of a change in the original purpose of a loan and the effect on the deductibility of an interest expenditure will be examined. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Soos enige ander uitgawe, word rente uitgawes se aftrekbaarheid bepaal deur dit te onderwerp aan die toetse soos neergele in die algemene aftrekkingsformule, vervat in artikel 11 (a), saamgelees met artikel 23 (f) en 23 (g) van die Inkomstebelastingwet, asook die spesiale aftrekkings wat op rente van toepassing is. In hierdie studie word slegs op die algemene aftrekkingsformule, vervat in artikel 11 (a), saamgelees met artikel 23 (f) en 23 (g) van die Inkomstebelastingwet gekonsentreer. Die algemene toets volgens artikel 11 (a) wat deur die howe neergele is om te bepaal of 'n uitgawe aangegaan in 'n bedryf aftrekbaar is, is om eerstens te bepaal of die handeling waaraan die uitgawe verbind is by die voortbrenging van inkomste aangegaan is en tweedens of die uitgawe wat aangegaan is nou genoeg verwant is aan die bedryf sod at dit as deel van die koste beskou kan word om die bedryf te beoefen. Die howe het verskeie faktore oorweeg om te bepaal of die aftrekbaarheid van rente uitgawes voldoen aan die statutere vereistes soos bepaal deur artikel 11 (a), saamgelees met artikel 23 (f) en 23 (g) van die Inkomstebelastingwet. Daar blyk een toets te wees wat op die meeste statutêre vereistes toegepas kan word en wat ook as die bepalende factor beskou kan word om die aftrekbaarheid van rente uitgawes te beoordeel en dit is die oorspronklike doel waarmee die lening aangegaan is wat die rente uitgawe tot gevolg het. In hierdie studie word eerstens ondersoek ingestel na die faktore wat die howe oorweeg om te bepaal of 'n rente uitgawe aan die vereistes, soos uiteengesit in die inleiding van artikel 11 (a), saamgelees met artikel 23 (f) en 23 (g), voldoen met spesifieke verwysing na die doel waarmee 'n lening aangegaan word.

40|$|While private {{pensions}} {{have long}} been {{an integral part of}} old age insurance in America, it is now also in Germany on the rise. To increase the attractiveness and acceptance of private pension provision in the population, saving incentives have been used. In Germany, a Riester saver expects a savings subsidy and a <b>special</b> expense <b>deduction.</b> In addition, all contributions to private retirement provision are taxed downstream. The incentive design is {{at the expense of the}} state budget, so the question of the efficiency of savings incentives, such as the Riester pension is an issue of central importance. Empirical studies that have addressed the effective-ness of savings incentives, have thereby limited solely to the effect on the savings rate. The results of these papers are very different. In this work the efficiency of the Riester-subsidy has a much wider interpretation. In particular, one should not limit the usefulness of such a fund-ing measure only on increasing the savings rate. As a fact can be established that an increase of signed Riester contracts is already a benefit of increased funding, depending on the kind of saving which had been substituted. An empirical analysis based on data from the Socio-Economic Panel shows that the objectives have already partly been achieved since many the likelihood of signing a Riester contract increases with the number of children. Additionally individuals with low income are increasingly signing Riester contracts. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper first {{refers to}} the key concept of {{recognition}} of asset losses under the corporate tax law. The tax law basically restricts the loss deduction and imposes requirements of "settlements" with a fact of physical or monetary damage for the <b>special</b> loss <b>deduction</b> unless potential nonrecognized losses may be deducted under the accounting standards {{from the viewpoint of}} disclosure for asset fair values. This loss deduction rule is derived from the foreseeability and legal stability in calculation of taxable income. This paper secondly explains the content and legislative context of the recent amendments in the depreciation system and allowance expenses. Some allowance systems has been repealed in order to enlarge the tax base and increase the tax revenue, however, the accelerated depreciation, newly introduced system in the recent corporate tax reform, brought a broad accrual expense, where it caused an opposite result to the tax base. I would rather mention the background of the past tax reforms and suggest the range of estimated accrual expenses should be more broadened. Finally, this paper would clarify the contemporary signification in the loss deduction rule. ASBJ has issued the cumulative accounting standards for the global convergence, and is now required the final decision for the IFRS adoption. It would likely be said that harmonization between the accounting and tax enforcement would be continuously pursed through this convergence process. The loss deduction rule would have a vital role in the fair value measurement in tax accounting, where tax income and each tax item on a balance sheet are measured by an index with high accuracy and legal settlement...|$|R
