Like {{the rest of the}} Mycenaean-era armies, it was depicted as composed largely of infantry, equipped with short swords, spears, and Dipylon-type ("8"-shaped <b>simple</b> <b>round</b> bronze shields). This was the Golden Age of Warfare.|$|E
25|$|Attached to {{the nave}} are {{the north and}} south aisles. The early 15th-century north aisle is of string-coursed ashlar, buttressed, with four windows of same {{appearance}} and stylerectilinear with inset three lights of <b>simple</b> <b>round</b> head, diamond-pattern leaded clear glazing, and flattened hood moulds. Three windows are placed on the north wall, the fourth serves as the aisle west window. Between the two north wall western windows is a simply moulded and slightly pointed door opening with hood mould and label stops, and a carved finial above. Within is a face-hinged oak door. The north aisle parapet is deeply crenellated to the same style as the tower battlements. Above the windows runs a moulding, defining the roof edge {{at the base of the}} parapet, holding two gargoyles which drain the aisle roof. Two double-stepped angle buttresses support the aisle on its north wall, with a third diagonal buttress at the north-west corner.|$|E
25|$|Of all {{the architects}} {{associated}} with Blacket, {{the one who}} would become most famous was John Horbury Hunt, who worked with him from 1863 to 1868. It was at this time, that Blacket's architecture developed bolder forms, based upon Norman, Transitional and Early French Gothic architecture, rather than the more refined Gothic. This is particularly noticeable in the presence of <b>simple</b> <b>round</b> windows divided by four circles of tracery in the gables of several churches of this time. Blacket permitted his staff to enter competitions, and it was while at Blacket's office that Horbury Hunt won the commission for Newcastle Cathedral, to be executed in his preferred material of brick. The brick church at Tumut, consecrated in 1873, is ascribed to Blacket, but appears to owe much to Hunt. Hunt, who lived most of his early life in North America, had previously worked under Edward Clarke Cabot. One of the innovations that he introduced to Australian architecture while working for Blacket was the saw-tooth roof for industrial building, which was employed at Mort's Woolstore. Hunt appears to have been influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement, particularly Philip Webb, and ultimately he created buildings of great originality such as the Anglican Cathedrals of Grafton and Armidale.|$|E

2500|$|Locke was cremated, and his remains {{turned over}} to Dr. Arthur Fauset, an {{anthropologist}} who was a major figure in the Harlem Renaissance. Fauset was Locke's close friend, and executor of his estate. Fauset died in 1983, and the remains were given to his friend, Reverend Sadie Mitchell. Mitchell ministered at African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas in Philadelphia. Mitchell retained the ashes until the mid-1990s, when she asked Dr. J. Weldon Norris, a professor of music at Howard University, to take the ashes to Washington, D.C. [...] The ashes then resided at Howard University's Moorland–Spingarn Research Center until 2007. Concerned that the human remains were not properly cared for, the ashes were given to Howard University's W. Montague Cobb Research Laboratory, which had extensive experience handling human remains. Locke's ashes, which were stored in a plain paper bag in a <b>simple</b> <b>round</b> metal container, were transferred to a more appropriate small funerary urn. They were locked in a safe to keep them secure.|$|E

He courageously denounced the greed shown by certain courtiers with reference to the property of the suppressed monasteries and defended himself before the privy council. He also declined to wear the prescribed vestments, donning instead a <b>simple</b> <b>round</b> cap. On the accession of Mary he preached at Paul's Cross commending the [...] "true doctrine taught in King Edward's days," [...] and warning his hearers against [...] "pestilent Popery, idolatry and superstition." [...] Defamatory pamphlets littered the streets exhorting Protestants to take up arms against Mary Tudor. ‘Nobles and gentlemen favouring the word of God’ were asked to overthrow the ‘detestable papists’, especially ‘the great devil’, Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester. A number of leading Protestant figures, including John Rogers, were arrested and leading reformist bishops such as John Hooper and Hugh Latimer were imprisoned weeks later. Thomas Cranmer was sent to the Tower for his role in Lady Jane’s attempted coup.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, archeologists working in Northeast Arkansas for the Arkansas Archeological Survey began {{research}} into causes of Mississippi Valley potters' relatively sudden shift to shell temper. The team conducted {{research at the}} AAS Station Lab at Arkansas State University involving macroscopic, microscopic, petrographic thin-sections, atomic absorption and x-ray diffraction analyses. A member of the team, Michael G. Million, also conducted replicative experiments, perhaps the first to do so with the exact clays, tempers and tools used by prehistoric Mississippian potters. Pastes were created {{using a variety of}} temper-to-clay percentages so that vessels as well as test-tiles could be produced for examination. Test tiles gave information about the shrinkage rates of various clay/temper combinations to the 'green' state and then further information upon firing. <b>Simple,</b> <b>round</b> bottom cooking jars were built using coil construction and the Mississippian pottery tool set including a potteryanvil, wooden paddle, mussel shell scrapers and polishing stones. The research discovered that there were very good reasons for using shell tempering for Mississippi Valley clays. The nature of clays formed by such a large meandering river system are distinctive. The huge annually flooded backswamp areas create a clay which is composed of very minute clay particles (primarily silica) and a high proportion of organic content. This is caused by the slow settling or deposition of the alluvial materials after floods. The clay particles tend to measure just a few micrometres in size and in plate-like form. Large amounts of water can be tightly held in the interspace between the clay particles. Add to this the organic ooze, and one has what is known colloquially as [...] "gumbo" [...] clay.|$|E

40|$|If rounded {{data are}} used in {{estimating}} moments and regression coefficients, the estimates are typically more or less biased. The purpose of the paper is to study the bias inducing effect of rounding, which is also seen when population moments instead of their estimates are considered. Under appropriate conditions this effect can be approximately specified by versions of Sheppard's correction formula. We discuss {{the conditions under which}} these approximations are valid. We also investigate the efficiency loss that comes along with rounding. The rounding error, which corresponds to the measurement error of a measurement error model, has a marginal distribution which can be approximated by the uniform distribution. We generalize the concept of <b>simple</b> <b>rounding</b> to that of asymmetric rounding and study its effect on the mean and variance of a distribution under similar circumstances as with <b>simple</b> <b>rounding.</b> ...|$|R
