50|$|Keyhole/Gambit III (KH-8) - The Gambit III {{satellite}} system was amongst the longest <b>serving</b> <b>satellite</b> reconnaissance programs {{operated by the}} United States during the Cold War. This {{satellite system}} would operate from July 1966 to April 1984. Of the fifty-four launch attempts, only three would fail, {{all of which were}} attributed to rocket failure. The average mission time of the Gambit III satellite systems were thirty-one days. The Gambit III satellites would differ from the Gambit I satellites in that the Gambit III had a four camera system, which carried over twelve thousand feet of film, and were able to produce resolutions as small as four inches.|$|E
40|$|The Ellipso(trademark) Mobile Satellite System is {{conceived}} to extend telecommunication services {{throughout the world}} to users that are not well, {{or not at all}} served by existing mobile or fixed telephone systems. Unlike cellular telephones, Ellipso(trademark) offers fully nationwide service to every served country, thereby providing service to users located anywhere within the national boundaries, no matter how isolated or remote. With Ellipso(trademark), a user {{in the middle of a}} wilderness area will have the same mobile telecommunications service as a user in a major metropolitan area. Ellipso(trademark) uses medium earth orbiting (MEO) satellites and an efficient system design to reach its subscribers directly and at a price that is competitive with terrestrial telephone services. The subscriber only requires a clear view of a <b>serving</b> <b>satellite</b> to achieve a connection and to connect to anyone else served by the national telecommunications system. Subscribers within view of two or more satellites will benefit from Ellipso's(trademark) unique satellite diversity processing, using all available satellites simultaneously to optimize circuit quality...|$|E

Major international CDR initiatives, programs, and projects are summarized. Societal benefits of CDRs in various user sectors, including Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries, Energy, Heath, Water, Transportation, and Tourism are also briefly discussed. The challenges and opportunities for CDR development, production and service are also addressed. It is essential to maintain credible CDR products by allowing free access to products and keeping the production process transparent by making source code and documentation available with the dataset...|$|R
