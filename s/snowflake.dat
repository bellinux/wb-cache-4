5|$|A <b>snowflake</b> {{consists}} of roughly 1019 water molecules, which {{are added to}} its core at different rates and in different patterns, depending on the changing temperature and humidity within the atmosphere that the <b>snowflake</b> falls through {{on its way to}} the ground. As a result, snowflakes vary among themselves, while following similar patterns.|$|E
5|$|Bob Muglia is {{currently}} the Chief Executive Officer of <b>Snowflake</b> Computing, a cloud-based data-warehousing startup. He joined the company in June 2014, a couple {{years after it was}} founded in 2012. <b>Snowflake</b> Computing came out of stealth mode that October.|$|E
500|$|<b>Snowflakes</b> form in a {{wide variety}} of {{intricate}} shapes, leading to the notion that [...] "no two are alike". Although nearly-identical <b>snowflakes</b> can exist, they are very unlikely to be found in nature. Initial attempts to find identical <b>snowflakes</b> by photographing thousands of them with a microscope from 1885 onward by Wilson Alwyn Bentley found the wide variety of <b>snowflakes</b> we know about today.|$|R

40|$|Falling {{attitude}} of <b>snowflakes</b> were simultaneously photographed by two tv camerae from {{horizontal and vertical}} directions. These images were analyzed by image processor and personal computer. The attitude and location of each <b>snowflakes</b> were measured every 1 / 30 seconds from their two images. There were two patterns in falling motion of <b>snowflakes,</b> one was rotational trajectory, the other was spiral trajectry. And there was a tendency that the rotational speed of smaller <b>snowflakes</b> was faster than the bigger one, and the directions of revolution and rotation in falling <b>snowflakes</b> were the same in many cases...|$|R

5|$|Snowflakes {{are also}} {{often used as}} symbols {{representing}} winter or cold conditions. For example, snow tires which enhance traction during harsh winter driving conditions are labelled with a <b>snowflake</b> on the mountain symbol. A stylized <b>snowflake</b> {{has been part of}} the emblem of the 1968 Winter Olympics, 1972 Winter Olympics, 1988 Winter Olympics, 1998 Winter Olympics and 2002 Winter Olympics.|$|E

5|$|Clarke privately tells Warren that {{he thinks}} Elizabeth is {{innocent}} {{and that he is}} not sure that the pair are doing God's work. Warren threatens that Clarke himself will be tried and convicted if he objects further. The trial resumes—Elizabeth having been tortured overnight—and Elizabeth's mouse, <b>Snowflake,</b> is released, so that it might lead them to the witch. Warren has sprinkled crumbs in front of Elizabeth. When <b>Snowflake</b> approaches Elizabeth, Pike declares her a witch, and sentences her to be burned. Thomas and Sarah later say goodbye to a hooded and bound Elizabeth, who awaits execution. Clarke dismisses them. He removes the hood from the figure to reveal that he has bound Warren in Elizabeth's place; Clarke believes Warren has been tainted with evil, and that the latter is no longer doing God's work. Clarke puts back the hood, and Pike enters, happy that the trial has seen a revival of trade and visitors to the village. Warren is taken away to be burnt. Clarke releases the real Elizabeth, but she reveals that she truly is a witch; she breaks Clarke's neck, killing him. There are sounds of excitement from outside as flames light Elizabeth's face. She tells <b>Snowflake</b> that she will go to her master, then transforms into a raven and leaves.|$|E
5|$|Micrography of {{thousands}} of <b>snowflakes</b> from 1885 onward, starting with Wilson Alwyn Bentley, revealed the wide diversity of <b>snowflakes</b> within a classifiable set of patterns. Closely matching snow crystals have been observed.|$|R
40|$|There is {{a common}} {{perception}} that <b>snowflakes</b> are 6 -sided and a common quip that &quot;no two <b>snowflakes</b> are alike&quot;. The 6 -fold symmetry suggests that the growth is deterministic, while the differences suggest the growth is so sensitive to conditions that remarkable variety appears. We investigate fuzzy automata that give a great diversity of growth patterns, have sensitivity to background conditions, and which maintain the symmetry of <b>snowflakes...</b>|$|R

5|$|Marshmallow fluff, {{one of the}} {{two main}} {{ingredients}} of a Fluffernutter, was invented in the early 20th century. Archibald Query invented a creation he called Marshmallow Creme in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1917, while Amory and Emma Curtis of Melrose, Massachusetts, invented <b>Snowflake</b> Marshmallow Creme in 1913. During World War I, Emma Curtis published a recipe for the Liberty Sandwich, which consisted of peanut butter and <b>Snowflake</b> Marshmallow Creme on oat or barley bread. The recipe was published in a promotional booklet sent to Curtis' customers in 1918 and may be the origin of the Fluffernutter sandwich. Earlier labels and booklets published by the Curtises suggested combining Snow Flake Marshmallow Creme with peanut butter or eating it on sandwiches with chopped nuts or olives.|$|E

50|$|However, when <b>snowflakes</b> crystallize, they do {{not touch}} each other. Thus, <b>snowflakes</b> form euhedral, six-sided twinned crystals. In rocks, the {{presence}} of euhedral crystals may signify that they formed early in the crystallization of magma or perhaps crystallized in a cavity or vug, without hindrance from other crystals.|$|R

5|$|Crystals, though long {{admired for}} their {{regularity}} and symmetry, were not investigated scientifically until the 17th century. Johannes Kepler hypothesized {{in his work}} Strena seu de Nive Sexangula (A New Year's Gift of Hexagonal Snow) (1611) that the hexagonal symmetry of <b>snowflake</b> crystals was due to a regular packing of spherical water particles.|$|E

While the traditional Norwegian rosemaling was the inspiration for her costuming early in the film, her ice gown was designed similarly to her palace, with snowflakes heavily influencing the style.

5|$|It is {{not always}} easy to predict a grown Appaloosa's color at birth. Foals of any breed tend to be born with coats that darken when they shed their baby hair. In addition, Appaloosa foals do not always show classic leopard complex characteristics. Patterns {{sometimes}} change {{over the course of the}} horse's life although some, such as the blanket and leopard patterns, tend to be stable. Horses with the varnish roan and <b>snowflake</b> patterns are especially prone to show very little color pattern at birth, developing more visible spotting as they get older.|$|E
5|$|Burns and Rigby {{found several}} prototiles, {{including}} the Koch <b>snowflake,</b> {{that may be}} used to tile the plane only by using copies of the prototile in two or more different sizes. An earlier paper by Danzer, Grünbaum, and Shephard provides another example, a convex pentagon that tiles the plane only when combined in two sizes. Although the Pythagorean tiling uses two different sizes of squares, the square does not have the same property as these prototiles of only tiling by similarity, because it also is possible to tile the plane using only squares of a single size.|$|E
