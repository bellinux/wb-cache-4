Archival evidence on foreign exchange balances for 1938 - 40 shows that trade policies alone had only a small effect.

40|$|Summaries Official {{reports on}} {{household}} surveys of Uganda in 1989 and 1992 imply a 34 per cent fall in real consumption per household. Various adjustments are considered which reduce the apparent fall in living standards to 6 per cent. However, even these <b>adjusted</b> <b>figures</b> imply worsening living standards, increased poverty and greater inequality. The reliability of such comparisons is questioned based on discrepancies concerning production estimates, household size, recall periods and budget shares. It is hypothesized that these discrepancies arise from differences in survey design. Such sensitivity suggests that estimates of economic welfare from conventional household surveys are more relative than commonly thought...|$|R
5000|$|Realizing the {{importance}} of having a national chart, which [...] "helped bring the Greek music industry back into the public eye", IFPI sought to employ a system where albums would be tracked based upon actual sales to the public, as opposed to the number of retail shipments as was previously used. It was planned for these reformed charts to be operable by early 1992, however a complete overhaul of the charting method never materialized and future charts were once again based upon shipments, this time with <b>adjusted</b> <b>figures</b> via the sampling of record store inventories to form an estimation of actual consumer sales.|$|R

As of 2016 the use of renewable energy in the transport sector remains well behind the other energy sectors in most countries. Biodiesels provided the largest share of RE in the transport sector at 4% of the total. Renewable electricity provided 0.45% of the sector's requirements, {{most of it in}} public transport uses. Bioethanol also provided a small contribution at 0.03% of the total.|$|R
40|$|In Austria, {{seasonally}} {{and working}} day adjusted GDP grew {{only by a}} mere 0. 4 percent in real terms quarter-on-quarter {{in the second quarter}} of 2008 (+ 2 percent in year-on-year terms), according to WIFO's flash estimate. This marks the end of the economic upswing. The reversal of the economic trend first became apparent in export and manufacturing. Private consumption is also dampened by declining real incomes. Tourism and construction, on the other hand, expand steadily. While labour market conditions continue to improve compared with a year earlier, the seasonally <b>adjusted</b> <b>figures</b> already show a flattening of employment growth and an increase in unemployment.

50|$|The use of <b>adjusted</b> <b>figures</b> {{is used in}} {{undertaking}} {{some forms}} of economic analysis. For example, {{to report on the}} relative economic successes of two nations, real wage figures are more useful than nominal figures. The importance of considering real wages also appears when looking at the history of a single country. If only nominal wages are considered, the conclusion has to be that people used to be significantly poorer than today. However, the cost of living was also much lower. To have an accurate view of a nation's wealth in any given year, inflation has {{to be taken into account}} and real wages must be used as one measuring stick.|$|R

Statistics Finland uses a software tool called Demetra (version 2. 2) and a model-based method called Tramo/Seats to produce seasonally <b>adjusted</b> <b>figures.</b> Recently a new seasonal adjustment tool, J-Demetra+, has been released. This tool also allows the user to do seasonal adjustment with Tramo/Seats. This paper makes a comparison of J-Demetra+ and Demetra. We put emphasis on the comparison of results obtained by these two tools and using them in day-to-day production. The findings are illustrated by using empirical time series by Statistics Finland. We also discuss practical implications of replacing Demetra by J-Demetra+ in the daily production system...|$|R
