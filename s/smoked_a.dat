5|$|Disney {{had been}} a heavy smoker since World WarI. He did not use {{cigarettes}} with filters, and had <b>smoked</b> <b>a</b> pipe as a young man. In November 1966, {{he was diagnosed with}} lung cancer and was treated with cobalt therapy. On November 30 he felt unwell and was taken to St. Joseph Hospital where, on December 15, ten days after his 65th birthday, he died of circulatory collapse caused by lung cancer. Disney's remains were cremated two days later, and his ashes interred at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.|$|E
5|$|Nhung {{was born}} in either 1919 or early 1920. At the time, Vietnam was a French colony within French Indochina; and, in 1944, Nhung joined the French Army, where he soon met Dương Văn Minh, who became his {{superior}} {{for the next two}} decades. Nhung would spend most of his career as Minh's aide-de-camp and bodyguard. He was described as a quiet and slightly built man who <b>smoked</b> <b>a</b> pipe. Following the end of World War II, the French set up the State of Vietnam, an associated state within the French Union, and created the Vietnamese National Army (VNA), and both Minh and Nhung transferred to the VNA, where they were trained and commissioned as officers. As of November 1963, Nhung had risen to the rank of captain.|$|E
5|$|Seydlitz was {{generally}} admired for the superb coup d'œil {{that allowed him}} to utilize the cavalry to its full potential. His 19th century biographer, K. A. Varnhagen von Ense, related that Seydlitz lived above all for the service, and promoted the training of his hussars before all else. According to Anton König, who wrote in 17801790, Seydlitz performed best at taverns and excelled in practical jokes: one would gather that Seydlitz was a drunkard, a rake, and a savage, but another of his biographers, Bernhard von Poten, cited conflicting descriptions offered by Seydlitz's contemporaries, particularly Warnery, as more accurate. Nevertheless, there is some evidence to support König's assertion, at least of Seydlitz's excesses: Seydlitz was no doubt dependent upon his tobacco and had been since his teenage years, although he <b>smoked</b> <b>a</b> pipe rather than using snuff, as many officers did; he was indeed reckless, as his career testified; he enjoyed the company of women; and Seydlitz indeed suffered from recurring illness.|$|E

However, the character is still recognizably Columbo, and uses {{some of the same}} methods of misdirecting and distracting his suspects. During the course of the show, the increasingly frightened murderer brings pressure from the district attorney's office to have Columbo taken off the case, but the detective fights back with his own contacts.|$|E

He ran over to help the police. Smeaton aimed a kick at the testes of Kafeel Ahmed, who later died from 90% burns following the attack. During the incident Smeaton also helped drag Michael Kerr to safety after Kerr had been left lying with a broken leg beside the burning jeep after kicking Ahmed.|$|E
25|$|In April 1996, Randy Moss <b>smoked</b> <b>a</b> joint {{just prior}} to turning himself into jail. He was {{scheduled}} to finish {{the remainder of his}} 30-day sentence for misdemeanor battery while in high school. During his first week in jail, Moss was given a drug test that came back positive. He was placed in solitary confinement for a week and had 60 days attached to his 27-day sentence. Coach Bobby Bowden revoked his scholarship and Moss was dismissed from Florida State University for the failed drug test.|$|E
25|$|Children {{of smoking}} parents {{are more likely}} to smoke than {{children}} with non-smoking parents. Children of parents who smoke are less likely to quit smoking. One study found that parental smoking cessation was associated with less adolescent smoking, except when the other parent currently <b>smoked.</b> <b>A</b> current study tested the relation of adolescent smoking to rules regulating where adults are allowed to smoke in the home. Results showed that restrictive home smoking policies were associated with lower likelihood of trying smoking for both middle and high school students.|$|E

25|$|Back in the fort, Boone {{outlined}} the situation. The consensus was to fight rather than surrender. The {{decision was made}} to prolong the negotiations with Blackfish as long as possible, since reinforcements from Virginia were expected. Boone and Major William Bailey Smith went outside again and told Blackfish that they feared that the trip to Detroit would be too hard on the women and children. Blackfish pointed out that he had brought 40 horses to transport those unable to walk. Boone asked for another day to consult with the others. Leaders from the two sides <b>smoked</b> <b>a</b> ceremonial pipe together to mark the peace agreement, and then broke off negotiations for the day.|$|E
25|$|Federal {{and provincial}} viceroys {{also met with}} First Nations leaders for more {{ceremonial}} occasions, such as when in 1867 Canada's first governor general, the Viscount Monk, received a native chief, in full feathers, {{among some of the}} first guests at Rideau Hall. The Marguess of Lansdowne <b>smoked</b> <b>a</b> calumet with Aboriginal people in the Prairies, the Marquess of Lorne was there named Great Brother-in-Law, and the Lord Tweedsmuir was honoured by the Kainai Nation through being made a chief of the Blood Indians and met with Grey Owl in Saskatchewan. The Earl Alexander of Tunis was presented with a totem pole by Kwakiutl carver Mungo Martin, which Alexander erected on the grounds of Rideau Hall, where it stands today with the inukshuk by artist Kananginak Pootoogook that was commissioned in 1997 by Governor General Roméo LeBlanc to commemorate the second National Aboriginal Day. Governor General the Viscount Byng of Vimy undertook a far-reaching tour of the north in 1925, during which he met with First Nations and heard their grievances at Fort Providence and Fort Simpson. Later, Governor General Edward Schreyer was in 1984 made an honorary member of the Kainai Chieftainship, as was one of his viceregal successors, Adrienne Clarkson, who was made such on 23 July 2005, along with being adopted into the Blood Tribe with the name Grandmother of Many Nations. Clarkson was an avid supporter of Canada's north and Inuit culture, employing students from Nunavut Arctic College to assist in designing the Clarkson Cup and creating the Governor General's Northern Medal.|$|E

She washed her own glass and cutlery before proceeding to lunch. She enjoyed daube (braised beef) but was not keen on boiled fish. After the meal she <b>smoked</b> <b>a</b> Dunhill cigarette (formerly a cigar, a habit she had acquired from her husband) and drank {{a small amount of}} Port wine. She enjoyed chocolate (and at the age of 112 received a delivery of 800 kilogrammes after challenging a TV presenter – this was then distributed to care homes), and made herself daily a fruit salad based on banana slices and squeezed orange.|$|E
500|$|When first {{cast for}} the role, portraying actor William B. Davis thought {{a show about}} the paranormal would not last for long. Before joining The X-Files cast, Davis had not <b>smoked</b> <b>a</b> {{cigarette}} in twenty years. For the first two episodes he appeared in, he smoked [...] "real" [...] cigarettes, but later changed to herbal cigarettes, giving the reason that it was dangerous for his health. In at least one early script draft from the [...] "Pilot", a Special Agent named Lake Drazen is present at the meeting near {{the start of the}} episode, having chosen Scully for an assignment to evaluate the validity of Mulder's work on the X-Files. The scene was eventually deleted and replaced, and several crew members have hinted that Agent Drazen became the Smoking Man.|$|E

500|$|Waugh {{arrived in}} Oxford in January 1922. He was soon writing to old friends at Lancing about {{the pleasures of}} his new life; he {{informed}} Tom Driberg: [...] "I do no work here and never go to Chapel". During his first two terms, he generally followed convention; he <b>smoked</b> <b>a</b> pipe, bought a bicycle, and gave his maiden speech at the Oxford Union, opposing the motion that [...] "This House would welcome Prohibition". Waugh wrote reports on Union debates for both Oxford magazines, Cherwell and Isis, and he acted as a film critic for Isis. He also became secretary of the Hertford College debating society, [...] "an onerous but not honorific post", he told Driberg. Although Waugh tended to regard his scholarship {{as a reward for}} past efforts rather than a stepping-stone to future academic success, he did sufficient work in his first two terms to pass his [...] "History Previous", an essential preliminary examination.|$|E
500|$|In 1925, Earp {{began to}} {{collaborate}} on a biography {{with his friend}} and former mining engineer John Flood to get his story told {{in a way that}} he approved. Flood volunteered his time and attempted to write an authorized biography of Earp's life, based on Earp's recollections. The two men sat together every Sunday in the kitchen of Earp's modest, rented bungalow. While Wyatt sipped a drink and <b>smoked</b> <b>a</b> cigar, they tried to tell Earp's story, but Josephine was always present. She often interrupted and insisted, [...] "You can't write that! It needs to be clean." [...] She also demanded that they add more [...] "pep" [...] to the manuscript, which in her mind meant including the word [...] "CRACK!" [...] in all capitals. In the chapter about the shootout, the manuscript includes 109 uses of [...] "CRACK". She thought Earp needed to be shown as a hero, and the manuscript includes a chapter titled [...] "Conflagration" [...] in which Earp saves two women, one a cripple, from a Tombstone fire.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{first used}} {{drugs in the}} Beatles' Hamburg days, when they often used Preludin to {{maintain}} their energy while performing for long periods. Bob Dylan introduced them to marijuana in a New York hotel room in 1964; McCartney recalls getting [...] "very high" [...] and [...] "giggling uncontrollably". His use of the drug soon became habitual, and according to Miles, McCartney wrote the lyrics [...] "another kind of mind" [...] in [...] "Got to Get You into My Life" [...] specifically as a reference to cannabis. During the filming of Help!, McCartney occasionally <b>smoked</b> <b>a</b> joint {{in the car on}} the way to the studio during filming, and often forgot his lines. Director Richard Lester overheard two physically attractive women trying to persuade McCartney to use heroin, but he refused. Introduced to cocaine by Robert Fraser, McCartney used the drug regularly during the recording of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, and for about a year total but stopped because of his dislike of the unpleasant melancholy he felt afterwards.|$|E
