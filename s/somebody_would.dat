5|$|In 2010, an Australian-based company OnTilt Designs Pty Ltd won a multi-year {{contract}} {{to become the}} official bracelet manufacturer for the WSOP. OnTilt jewelers decided that the 2010 bracelet design {{would return to the}} tradition of the 1970s and 1980s where the bracelet was a heavy piece of unadorned metal. American jewelry designer Steve Soffa was chosen to design and manufacture the entire set of bracelets. The goal was to create a bracelet that <b>somebody</b> <b>would</b> actually want to wear every day. In 2011, OnTilt has also been chosen to manufacture the WSOP Circuit rings.|$|E
5|$|The {{meeting on}} 17 January was crowded. Many {{attendees}} were not electors, as franchise {{was attached to}} land ownership in excess of £50, or yearly rental over £10, and the resulting roll was only about 160 names long, including absentee owners in England. There had been rumours beforehand that <b>somebody</b> <b>would</b> come forward to oppose Sewell. William Thomson was elected to chair the meeting. Sewell spoke at length about various issues: {{that he should be}} elected because of the service that he had given Canterbury as their representative when in financial crisis, that he even delayed his departure to England to resolve the issues, that he had no conflict of interest with the steam ship company that provided New Zealand's postal service with England, {{that he did not have}} land holdings in the North Island more valuable than holdings in Canterbury, that he gave qualified support to the Lyttelton Rail Tunnel project and he gave his reasons for leaving the Stafford Ministry so soon after his return to the colony last year. He disagreed with Stafford's government on some issues. The two most important disagreements were land policy, where Sewell wanted the land revenue to be retained by the provincial governments, rather than the southern provinces pay a high proportion of their revenue to enable purchase of land in the north, and native policy, where Sewell predicted that the land policy being pursued would result in strong conflict with Māori; in fact, the First Taranaki War started in March 1860. As a solution, Sewell suggested the possible separation of the North Island and the South Island into separate countries; this was the first time, as far as the editor of the Lyttelton Times was aware, that such a suggestion had been made in public by a politician. The politician who is today known to have favoured separation is Julius Vogel, and he started campaigning for this idea in 1862. The Lyttelton Times argued, against the objection of many, that such an idea had merit for further consideration.|$|E
5|$|The {{report found}} that the {{tendency}} of the evidence presented in the programme was to suggest the terrorists had been unlawfully killed, and {{that it did not}} explore alternative explanations in any depth. Nevertheless, Windlesham and Rampton believed that the programme presented evidence for one possible explanation, but sought to raise questions rather than reach a conclusion. In analysing the content of the programme, they found that it allowed the witnesses to give their accounts in their own words rather than presenting them as established fact. Thus, they found that the content did not infringe any requirement for neutrality. The report scrutinised in detail the statements of the eyewitnesses who spoke on camera, including the parts of the interviews that {{were not included in the}} broadcast version of the programme. It found, with two exceptions, that the witnesses' statements were fairly represented in the programme. The exceptions were that the programme suggested that Bullock had not heard a warning, when he was in no position to hear whether such a warning was given or not; and that the commentary implied that all four witnesses who appeared on the programme had seen no threatening movements from the IRA members, when only two had been asked whether they witnessed such movements. Windlesham and Rampton also considered Asquez's statement and the journalists' decision to incorporate it into the programme. The report considered that the journalists acted reasonably in using the statement, despite Asquez's refusal to sign it, on the grounds that Asquez had given two separate, near-identical statements (including one to a lawyer), and that they considered it unlikely that <b>somebody</b> <b>would</b> invent such a dramatic account. Nonetheless, the report criticised the programme for not informing viewers of Asquez's refusal to sign the statement.|$|E

25|$|On November 1, 2003, the Associated Press {{published}} a lengthy report on inhumane treatment, beatings, and deaths at Abu Ghraib and other American prisons in Iraq. This report {{was based on}} interviews with released detainees, who told journalist Charles J. Hanley that inmates had been attacked by dogs, made to wear hoods, and humiliated in other ways. The article gained little notice. One freed detainee said that he wished <b>somebody</b> <b>would</b> publish pictures of what was happening.|$|E
25|$|Gotti was {{recognized}} as the Gambino family's boss {{and a member of}} The Commission by each of the other Five Families, including the Genovese family, whose approval for the hit on Castellano had been deliberately bypassed by Gotti and his co-conspirators. The Genovese family, however, was still upset that Gotti had proceeded without the full sanctioning of The Commission and cryptically announced that a Mafia rule had been broken, for which <b>somebody</b> <b>would</b> have to pay if and when The Commission, which was in disarray at the time due to the Mafia Commission Trial, met again. Gravano and DeCicco had been hiding out in safe houses, but they took the other families' full recognition of Gotti as an indication that it was safe to resurface.|$|E

I just want to find a little moment of time where I can feel good about myself one last time, then I'm finished with this long nightmare." [...] And that seemed like that would be Dualla.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} narrates the {{difficulties}} of finding and maintaining love. Cristin Maher of Taste of Country contended that the song exemplifies the desire some people have {{when they want to}} make the move from a physical relationship to an emotional relationship, which is represented by the song lyrics [...] "Let’s take it slow, I don’t want to move too fast / I don’t wanna just make love, I wanna make love last." [...] Gibson, one of the writers of the song, stated that the song does not contain a lot of flowery lyrics or sentiment. He added, [...] "It’s just straight up what <b>somebody</b> <b>would</b> say to somebody they’d want to be with." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} {{newspaper}} pieces about the K Foundation appeared in The Guardian the following Monday, correctly {{pointing out that the}} shortlist and exhibition were actually for the 1993 Turner Prize, the controversial £20,000 annual award given by the UK art establishment to the best young contemporary artist, but assuming that the K Foundation prize was a hoax. [...] "As for the K Foundation", the newspaper wrote, [...] "it stands unmasked as the current performing face of those cherished old friends of pop pranksterdom, Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty", formerly known as The KLF. In September, the organisers of the Turner Prize responded publicly that [...] "It proves the validity of our prize that <b>somebody</b> <b>would</b> take so much trouble to set up this award".|$|E

"Heartbreak Hotel" [...] was {{the second}} song Presley {{recorded}} at RCA Victor, following [...] "I Got a Woman", during his debut session at 1525 McGavock Street in Nashville on January 10, 1956. Presley arrived at the studio with the song ready to record without seeking RCA's approval, and although producer Steve Sholes was {{not sure that it}} would be a success, he recorded [...] "Heartbreak Hotel" [...] believing that Presley knew what he was doing. Recording at RCA Victor was a different experience for Presley and his band, who were used to a more relaxed atmosphere at Sun Studio. Guitar player Scotty Moore later commented, [...] "It was a larger studio than Sun's and more regimented - they called everything by a tape number. We would sit around at Sun, eat hamburgers and then <b>somebody</b> <b>would</b> say, 'Let's try something.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Nolan {{has denied}} the film criticizes the Occupy {{movement}} and insists {{that none of}} his Batman films are intended to be political: [...] "I've had as many conversations {{with people who have}} seen the film the other way round. We throw a lot of things against the wall to see if it sticks. We put a lot of interesting questions in the air, but that's simply a backdrop for the story. What we're really trying to do is show the cracks of society, show the conflicts that <b>somebody</b> <b>would</b> try to wedge open. We're going to get wildly different interpretations of what the film is supporting and not supporting, but it's not doing any of those things. It's just telling a story. If you're saying, 'Have you made a film that's supposed to be criticizing the Occupy Wall Street movement?' – well, obviously, that's not true." ...|$|E

2500|$|For the {{recording}} sessions, Zappa utilized 12 track recording technology, {{as well as}} a variety of techniques which realized his vision, including a large number of overdubs, playing unconventional instruments through studio effects, and speeding up or slowing down recordings for artistic effect. Zappa wanted to make an album that would challenge the complacency of contemporary music fans, as he felt that his fanbase was [...] "accustomed to accepting everything that was handed to them... politically, musically, socially– everything. <b>Somebody</b> <b>would</b> just hand it to them and they wouldn't question it.

2500|$|In October 2009, the Colorado Springs Independent {{published}} the first extensive interview with Haggard {{to appear in}} the secular press since the 2006 scandal. Over the course of a 2½-hour interview, the former pastor talked about the scandal, his agreement never to return to New Life or the state of Colorado, suicidal ideas, and the prospect of starting a new church in Colorado Springs. [...] "Back in the old days," [...] said Haggard, [...] "when <b>somebody</b> <b>would</b> get in trouble, they'd just need to move 40 or 50 miles, or a hundred miles, and they could start again.

2500|$|Having devoted most of {{his time}} to the {{jurisdictional}} arguments, he asked for some time to speak about the merits near the end. [...] "If we only knew what the school board would have done but for the phone call ," [...] Gottesman suggested, [...] "we know how to ... deal with this case." [...] The Court should follow precedent from civil-rights and labor law and put the burden of proving that on the defendant. Otherwise, [...] "every school board that wants to fire someone for a First Amendment reason, well ... no teacher can teach for five years without doing something <b>somebody</b> <b>would</b> find objectionable. Even though their motivation is solely the First Amendment reason, they'll tack on two or three other reasons."

2500|$|On April 1, 2014, Connecticut {{governor}} Dannel P.

2500|$|Several critics {{compared}} The Clone Wars to a Saturday morning cartoon {{and described}} it {{as little more than}} a plug for the upcoming animated series.

[...] Carrie Rickey, of The Philadelphia Inquirer, said, [...] "The best that can be said about the movie is that it's harmless and mostly charmless. The Clone Wars is to Star Wars what karaoke is to pop music." ...|$|E
