5000|$|Drones will congregate to {{specific}} sites known as drone congregation areas, and queens will mate at these sites {{when she is}} out on her mating flight.

25|$|Alarm pheromones warn {{members of}} a species of {{approaching}} danger. Because of their altruistic nature, they follow the rules of kin selection. They can elicit both aggregational and dispersive responses in social insects depending on the alarm caller’s location relative to the nest. Closer to the nest, it causes social insects to aggregate and may subsequently produce an attack against the threat. The Polistes canadensis, a primitively eusocial wasp species, will emit a chemical alarm substance at the approach of a predator, which will lower their nestmates' thresholds for attack, and even attract more nestmates to the alarm. The colony is thus able to rise quickly with its <b>sting</b> <b>chambers</b> open to defend its nest against predators. In nonsocial insects, these compounds typically stimulate dispersal regardless of location. Chemical alarm systems are best developed in aphids and treehoppers (family Membracidae) among the nonsocial groups. Alarm pheromones take {{on a variety of}} compositions, ranging from terpenoids in aphids and termites to acetates, an alcohol, and a ketone in honeybees to formic acid and terpenoids in ants.|$|R
5000|$|Queens of A. andreniformis {{commonly}} {{engage in}} polyandry, where the queen will mate with multiple drones, usually about 10-20 times in total. Due {{to the large}} amount of mating, queens must expel any excess semen. Excessive mating puts females at increased risk to predation since it must occur during flight and outside the nest in the open air. She is also at risk for sexually transmitted diseases and injury from unexpected inclement weather. Some Apis males put a [...] "mating sign" [...] in the <b>sting</b> <b>chamber</b> of the queen that she is unable to remove. This prevents her from avoiding unwanted copulation with other drones. In contrast, this sign is not found in A. andreniformis, suggesting that queens have control over the number of mates they copulate with. Although {{there is a lot of}} risk to the queen, benefits may arise from the increased genetic diversity within the colony. Genetic diversity can lead to increased resistance to disease and illnesses.|$|E
50|$|Adult female {{workers of}} P. pacificus have been {{observed}} to mouth and rub newly emerged female wasps, during which time the newly emerged wasps remain stationary. In several cases, the older worker used her gaster to rub the new wasp with discrete anterior to posterior strokes. In other cases, the older female has also been seen to mouth the young wasps with her mandibles, by opening and closing them over the new wasp’s head, thorax and gaster. While {{in contact with the}} younger wasp, the older worker kept her <b>sting</b> <b>chamber</b> open. The workers that were observed executing this behavior had few, small, only partially developed eggs in their ovaries, and had shriveled Dufour’s glands. Although it is unclear why exactly the wasps partook in this behavior, it is possible that doing so may give each of the newly emerged wasps the colony specific odor, which could ensure them safety when returning to the nest after foraging. It has also been hypothesized that this behavior may express some order of dominance.|$|E
50|$|Appropriate visual stimuli, {{such as the}} {{movements}} of nearby large or dark colored objects, can elicit attacks by the red paper wasps, which will fly at the object in alarm, attempting to sting it. An alarmed Polistes canadensis can release venom onto its nest; the odor of venom will prompt alarm responses in its nestmates, lower their thresholds for attack, and even attract more nestmates to the alarm. Through this chemical means of communicating alarm, the colony is able to rise quickly with its sting chambers open to defend its nest against predators. Because red paper wasps uniquely occupy multiple combs unattached to each other, the chemical alarm substance may have arisen as a necessary adaptation for a more efficient alarm for a sparsely dispersed nest. It is not known whether these red paper wasps can release venom at the nest independent of stinging behavior in order to communicate alarm to nestmates. While these wasps have been seen to open the <b>sting</b> <b>chamber</b> independently of venom release on the nest, the solo release of venom has not been observed. The Polistes canadensis may open its sting chambers {{as part of a}} defensive display (involves bending of the gaster toward the source of alarm) or in preparation for stinging.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{emphasizes}} the topics concerning honey bee (Apis mellifera L.) mating biology, {{which have not}} been described in the recently published book of Koeniger et al. (2014). At the beginning of natural mating, the drone becomes paralyzed. However, the muscles in the abdomen continuously contract shrinking the abdomen till mating has ended and the pair have separated. It is not the queen that ends the nuptial flight. The termination of the nuptial flight {{is determined by the}} drone, which fails to remove the mating sign of the previous drone from the <b>sting</b> <b>chamber</b> of the queen. The mating sign originates from two or more drones. The queen also does not determine the age at which she starts oviposition. It is the last drone, which tried to mate, but failed to remove the mating sign of the predecessor, that determines the age that the queen starts oviposition. The book of Koeniger et al. (2014), together with this paper, present the current knowledge of the mating biology of honey bees...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Artificial {{insemination}} (AI) is {{a technique}} to transfer instrumentally sperm from the male into the female’s reproductive system. AI is widespread in vertebrates for economical animal breeding and for conservation biology. However, in invertebrates only a few cases of successful AI have been reported. In this paper we describe a new tech-nique to artificially inseminate bumblebee queens (Bombus spp.). Males were dissected and the accessory testes were removed and washed in insect ringer. They were then opened and the outflowing sperm was picked up with a glass capil-lary mounted on a syringe. For the sperm transfer into the queen we adapted a standard apparatus used for honeybee inseminations. The queen was anaesthetized with CO 2, {{held in place by}} a queen holder and the <b>sting</b> <b>chamber</b> was opened using two hooks. The sperm containing glass capillary was introduced into the queen’s sexual tract. The sperm was re-leased into the bursa copulatrix very near the opening of the spermathecal duct of the queen. Inseminated queens were hibernated for 2 weeks and produced a normal colony under field conditions. Multiple inseminations proved to be suc-cessful since different patrilines could be detected in the worker offspring. Successful inseminations were performed for B. terrestris, B. lucorum and B. hypnorum...|$|E
