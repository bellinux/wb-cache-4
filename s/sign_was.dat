50|$|Western astrology {{uses the}} four {{classical}} elements {{in connection with}} astrological charts and horoscopes. The twelve signs of the zodiac are divided into the four elements: Fire <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> Aries, Leo and Sagittarius, Earth <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn, Air <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> Gemini, Libra and Aquarius, and Water <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces.|$|R

5|$|When compared, Black signers {{were more}} likely than were White signers to produce signs outside of the typical signing space and to use two-handed signs. Adverbs are most likely to use a larger signing space. Less marked forms, such as pronouns, determiners, plain verbs, and nouns, tend to be less likely to be {{produced}} outside the typical signing space. The selection of two-handed signs over one-handed signs was found to have systematic constraints on their production. When the sign could be produced with one or two hands, Black signers often produced the variant that matched the handedness of the following sign; if the following <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> two-handed, they {{were more likely}} to produce a two-handed variant, while if the following <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> one-handed, {{they were more likely to}} produce the one-handed variant. The use of innovative one-handed forms, though, even in environments which favored them, did not exceed 50 percent.|$|E

The space that Gypsy had occupied was immediately available for long-term lease, with furniture included.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism (from Greek ἀπό apo away, σῆμα sema <b>sign)</b> <b>was</b> a {{new term}} coined by Edward Bagnall Poulton for Alfred Russel Wallace's concept of warning coloration. It {{describes}} {{a family of}} antipredator adaptations in which a warning signal {{is associated with the}} unprofitability of a prey item to potential predators. Aposematism always involves an advertising signal. The warning signal may take the form of conspicuous animal coloration, sounds, odours or other perceivable characteristics. Aposematic signals are beneficial for both the predator and prey, since both avoid potential harm.|$|E

5|$|The captain {{asked for}} the descent {{checklist}} at 20:24:24. The fasten seat belt <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> switched on and the flight attendant started the process of preparing the cabin for landing. At 20:24:46 the captain, {{as part of the}} checklist, informed the first officer that they would go down to 1,500 ft at Torghatten and then down to 550ft. This was followed first by a partially unreadable conversation between the captain and the first officers, which included if they were to fill fuel, and then an unreadable conversation between the captain and the jump seat passenger. The direction of the VHF omnidirectional radio range (VOR) and distance measuring equipment (DME) at Brønnøysund was checked at 20:26:37.|$|E

Signs in Yanji, which borders North Korea, are in Korean and Chinese. Many areas of Qinghai province mandate bilingual signs in Tibetan and Chinese. In Beijing and Shanghai, due to international exposure of the 2008 Summer Olympics and Expo 2010, almost all city traffic <b>signs</b> <b>are</b> now bilingual with Chinese and English (during the Olympics, signs on Olympic venues were also in French). English use in <b>signs</b> <b>is</b> growing in other major cities as well.|$|R
5|$|The front {{entrance}} of the 1931 office building, on {{the southeast corner of}} the block, faced south on John Street towards Downtown Seattle and had the newspaper's name etched into the stone above the main entrance; the <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> supplemented for several decades by an ornate golden sign with the newspaper's letterhead that was installed above the main entrance. The exterior of the office building had subtle details, including etched columns and aluminum grillwork on the windows, forgoing ornaments for a simpler design that emphasized its mass. The main entrance was behind an elaborate aluminum gate, decorated with octagons, spirals and floral patterns. At the sides of the entrance were limestone panels with floral patterns carved into relief.|$|E
25|$|In September 2015, a 'Welcome' <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> {{installed}} in Iğdır and written in four languages, Turkish, Kurdish, English, and Armenian.

The Armenian portion of the <b>sign</b> <b>was</b> ultimately removed in June 2016.|$|E
