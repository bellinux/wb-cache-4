He had about 500 bushels of corn which he wanted to distribute among farmers, but had to develop means to do this, and to further improve the crops. Moore created two channels to do this: He founded the Wisconsin Experiment Association in 1901 in which he used UW-Madison College of Agriculture Long and Short Course graduates throughout the state to both further develop and disseminate the seeds, and he organized {{the boys and girls}} of Richland County in 1904 in a corn-project activity.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{basis of}} {{differences}} in seed quality are described for two groups of crops, grain legumes and vegetables and approaches to the improvement of quality are proposed. In grain legumes the major factors affecting seed quality are imbibition damage, seed ageing and their interaction. It is proposed that use of seed vigour tests, specifically the electrical conductivity test, to identify the incidence of imbibition damage and ageing allows the selection of seed lots for sale and for use under different field conditions. Alternatively in grain legume species {{in which there is}} a genotypic influence on predisposition to imbibition damage the approach to <b>seed</b> <b>improvement</b> may lie through selection in breeding programmes. Thus identification of testa characteristics that favour slow imbibition would enable selection for these characteristics. Seed ageing is also the major cause of reduced seed quality in vegetable species, leading to slow and asynchronous germination. An approach to their <b>seed</b> <b>improvement</b> has been the development of seed invigoration treatments based on seed hydration. The principle of these treatments is described and several treatments outlined, with emphasis being given to aerated hydration, a treatment completed within 36 h. The physiological basis of improvement by invigoration is discussed...|$|E

[...] Landrace cultivation in central and northwest Europe was almost eradicated by the early 20th century, due to economic pressure to grow improved, modern cultivars. [...] While many {{in the region are}} already extinct, some have survived in commercial European farming by being passed from generation to generation of farmers, and have also been revived by enthusiasts outside Europe to preserve European [...] "agricultural and food heritage" [...] elsewhere. [...] These survivals are usually for specific uses, such as thatch, and traditional European cuisine and craft beer brewing. Systematic preservation efforts for these cereal strains are ongoing, in situ and in online-searchable germplasm collections (seed banks), coordinated by Biodiversity International and the National Institute of Agricultural Botany (UK). [...] However, more may need to be done, because plant genetic variety, the source of crop health and seed quality, depends on a diversity of landraces and other traditionally used varieties. [...] Efforts (...) were mostly focused on Iberia, the Balkans, and European Russia, and dominated by species from mountainous areas. [...] Despite their incompleteness, these efforts have been described as [...] "crucial in preventing the extinction of many of these local ecotypes".|$|R

We investigated genetic diversity and correlations for floral and seed characteristics among 14 accessions of Ethiopian mustard to improve seed set and yield. Field trials were conducted during 2008 and 2009; flowers were examined for short stamen height, long stamen height, pistil height, and silliqua for seed weight, seeds/silliqua and silliqua/plant. Results were largely consistent between years, indicating that the variation measured was mainly controlled by genetic factors. High genetic variation for seed characters and reproductive phenology among the accessions was noted. The number of days to appearance of flowers showed high discriminatory ability among the accessions. A wide continuous variation was observed among accessions for anther-stigma separation. Accessions 1, 3 and 14 were identified as early flowering. A significant and positive correlation coefficient between short stamen height and seed weight indicated a substantial complementation among these characters for <b>seed</b> yield <b>improvement.</b> The short stamen height is a good indicator for selection in favour of seed commercialization and indices for selection of pollen parent for <b>seed</b> yield <b>improvement.</b> Accessions 5, 7, 14, 16 and 22 are best for multiple characters and are recommended for seed production for any of the seasons in Arusha, Tanzania...|$|R

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of oil, {{there has been a}} drastic decline in agricultural exports as percentage of total exports declined from about 43 % to slightly over 7 % between 1970 and 1974, {{as a result of the}} oil price shocks of 1973 – 1974 which resulted in large receipts of foreign exchange earnings by Nigeria and the neglect of agriculture. There have been series of declines in agricultural export since the mid- 1970 s at an average annual decline rate of 17 percent and by 1996, agricultural export accounted for only 2 percent of total exports, hence, making Nigeria net importer of basic food stuff. With this continual decline, the agricultural sector no longer earns enough foreign exchange through exports. Hence, this study investigates implications of agricultural seed financing on increased productivity output and export earnings in Nigeria.
