40|$|During July-September 1993 and May 1996, {{a survey}} of the {{metazoan}} parasites of 817 elasmobranchs from the Gulf of California, representing 42 species, was conducted at 14 sites along the western portion of the Gulf of California. Elasmobranchs were obtained from local commercial fishers. In this paper, we report all digeneans collected during the survey, excluding the gorgoderids, which will be presented in a subsequent paper. Four species from three hemiuroid families were collected, none of which was known previously from the Gulf of California. Syncoelium vermilionensis sp. n. (Syncoeliidae), a species that differs most notably from its congeners by having more testes, is described from the gills and gill arches of Mobula thurstoni and M. japonica. Paronatrema vaginicola (Syncoeliidae) is reported from the cloaca, gill arches, and buccal cavity of Prionace glauca (blue shark) and Alopias pelagicus (pelagic thresher shark). These hosts represent new host records for the species, {{and this is the first}} record of the parasite from the eastern Pacific Ocean. Observations of uterine morphology in S. vermilionensis and P. vaginicola along with published descriptions of other species in Syncoeliidae indicate that all members of this family obtain a diagnostically thick outer shell of their eggs within a thick-walled section of the uterus rather than in the ootype, as in other digenean groups. Otodistomum veliporum (Azygiidae) is reported from the stomach of Squatina californica (angel shark), from the body cavity of Mustelus helei (brown <b>smoothhound),</b> and from the stomach of two species of horn sharks (Heterodontus francisci and H. mexicanus). Mustelus henlei, H. francisci, and H. mexicanus are new hosts for the parasite. Ptychogonimus megastoma (Ptychogonimidae) is reported from the stomach of Mustelus lunulatus (sicklefin <b>smoothhound)</b> and M. californicus (gray <b>smoothhound).</b> Both are new hosts for the parasite, and this is the first report of the parasite from the eastern Pacific Ocean...|$|R
50|$|The Gulf <b>Smoothhound</b> shark {{is a type}} of shark {{that comes}} from the Triakidae family. It has a long slender body, a plain grey/brown dorsum, pale/white ventrum and a large and rounded dorsal fin. The fins have a pale to white {{trailing}} margin fading towards adulthood. The caudal fin is deeply notched; its teeth are flat and pale. This type of shark {{can be found in the}} continental shelf between depths of 36 m to 229 m. The maximum recorded size was 140 cm.|$|R
25|$|Dozens {{of species}} of fish {{have been found in}} the middens. Some of the most common are pike, whitefish, cod and ling at Østenkaer, anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and eel at Krabbesholm. The oldest site, Yderhede, {{featured}} remains of flatfish and sharks: porbeagle, topeshark, <b>smoothhound</b> and at Lystrup Enge spurdog. At Egsminde herring, cyprinids and European perch were found. The presence of deep-sea fish and sharks probably indicates the Ertebølle fishermen often ventured out on deep water. Whether they did so in their marshland dugouts or also owned larger, ocean-going ones is an answer that waits for more evidence.|$|R
5|$|The known diet of the {{dusky shark}} {{encompasses}} pelagic fishes, including herring and anchovies, tuna and mackerel, billfish, jacks, needlefish and flyingfish, threadfins, hairtails, lancetfish, and lanternfish; demersal fishes, including mullets, porgies, grunts, and flatheads, eels, lizardfish, cusk eels, gurnards, and flatfish; reef fishes, including barracudas, goatfish, spadefish, groupers, scorpionfish, and porcupinefish; cartilaginous fishes, including dogfish, sawsharks, angel sharks, catsharks, thresher sharks, <b>smoothhounds,</b> smaller requiem sharks, sawfish, guitarfish, skates, stingrays, and butterfly rays; and invertebrates, including cephalopods, decapod crustaceans, barnacles, and sea stars. Very rarely, the largest dusky sharks may also consume sea turtles, marine mammals (mainly as carrion), and human refuse.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{the related}} grey and brown <b>smoothhounds</b> that share its range, the leopard shark has {{smaller and more}} {{numerous}} red blood cells, allowing it to process oxygen more efficiently. This may be an adaptation for foraging in deoxygenated estuary environments. Their eyes contain very few cone cells, likely due to the murky water they inhabit. Small leopard sharks fall prey to larger sharks such as the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). On one occasion, a sevengill shark was seen ambushing a leopard shark on a tidal mudflat in Humboldt Bay, striking with such momentum that the larger predator momentarily beached itself. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Phyllobothrium riseri, Lacistorhynchus dollfusi and Paraorygmatobothrium barber, {{as well as the}} copepods Echthrogaleus eoleoptratus and Achtheinus oblongatus.|$|E
5|$|Fish make up some 90% of the blacktip shark's diet. A {{wide variety}} of fish have been {{recorded}} as prey for this species: sardines, herring, anchovies, ladyfish, sea catfish, cornetfish, flatfish, threadfins, mullet, mackerel, jacks, groupers, snook, porgies, mojarras, emperors, grunts, butterfish, tilapia, triggerfish, boxfish, and porcupinefish. They also feed on rays and skates, as well as smaller sharks such as <b>smoothhounds</b> and sharpnose sharks. Crustaceans and cephalopods are occasionally taken. In the Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey of the blacktip shark is the Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), followed by the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). Off South Africa, jacks and herring {{are the most important}} prey. Hunting peaks at dawn and dusk. The excitability and sociability of blacktip sharks makes them prone to feeding frenzies when large quantities of food are suddenly available, such as when fishing vessels dump their refuse overboard.|$|E
50|$|Anglers either use an uptide rod between 9 and 10 feet {{in length}} to cast from the boat or a shorter downtide rod between 6 and 8 feet. Lines are usually between 18 pounds and 50 pounds {{breaking}} strain dependent on the species of fish being targeted. Reels are usually multipliers, although fixed spool reels are being used more and more.

40|$|The vital {{parameter}} {{data for}} 62 stocks, covering 38 species, {{collected from the}} literature, including parameters of age, growth, and reproduction, were log-transformed and analyzed using multivariate analyses. Three groups were identified and empirical equations were developed for each to describe {{the relationships between the}} predicted finite rates of population increase (λ') and the vital parameters, maximum age (Tmax), age at maturity (Tm), annual fecundity (f/Rc)), size at birth (Lb), size at maturity (Lm), and asymptotic length (L∞). Group (1) included species with slow growth rates (0. 034 yr(- 1) < k < 0. 103 yr(- 1)) and extended longevity (26 yr < Tmax < 81 yr), e. g., shortfin mako Isurus oxyrinchus, dusky shark Carcharhinus obscurus, etc.; Group (2) included species with fast growth rates (0. 103 yr(- 1) < k < 0. 358 yr(- 1)) and short longevity (9 yr < Tmax < 26 yr), e. g., starspotted <b>smoothhound</b> Mustelus manazo, gray <b>smoothhound</b> M. californicus, etc.; Group (3) included late maturing species (Lm/L∞ ≧ 0. 75) with moderate longevity (Tmax < 29 yr), e. g., pelagic thresher Alopias pelagicus, sevengill shark Notorynchus cepedianus. The empirical equation for all data pooled was also developed. The λ' values estimated by these empirical equations showed good agreement with those calculated using conventional demographic analysis. The predictability was further validated by an independent data set of three species. The empirical equations developed in this study not only reduce the uncertainties in estimation but also account for the difference in life history among groups. This method therefore provides an efficient and effective approach to the implementation of precautionary shark management measures...|$|R
50|$|Fishing is also {{extremely}} popular in Newport Bay, {{off the coast}} of Newport, and along the Newport Bay Jetty. In the bay there are multiple locations to purchase bait for dockside or spear fishing convenience. There are about 80 fishable species located in Newport Bay. A few of the most commonly fished species are: Gray <b>Smoothhound</b> Shark, Leopard Shark, Round Stingray, Shovelnose Guitarfish, Pacific Staghorn Sculpin, Silvery Mullet, Top-smelt, California Halibut, Spotted Sand Bass, Yellowfin Croaker, Bat Ray, Thornback Ray, Diamond Turbot, Shiner Surfperch, Corbina, Opaleye, Pile Surfperch, and Red Shiner. Commercial fishing is also prominent in offshore Newport Beach and Newport Bay. One such sea creature commercially fished in the reefs in this area is lobster. Lobster season opens in late September.|$|R
5|$|From birth, leopard sharks form large schools {{generally}} segregated {{by age and}} sex, {{which may}} intermingle with grey or brown <b>smoothhounds</b> (Mustelus californicus and M. henlei) or spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias). These schools are apparently nomadic, often appearing suddenly in an area {{for a few hours}} and then vanishing just as quickly. In captivity, larger sharks have been observed establishing their dominance over smaller individuals via light nips to the pectoral fins. During summer days, large aggregations of mature females assemble in shallow bays and estuaries, dispersing at night. As these females follow the warmest patches of water, allowing them to raise their internal body temperatures by up to 3°C (5.4°F), they are speculated to be taking advantage of the heat to speed their growth and that of their gestating young. The membership of these aggregations is inconstant, with individual females periodically switching between different sites scattered over several kilometers.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{ultrastructure}} of the spermatozoon of Calliobothrium verticillatum (Cestoda, Tetraphyllidea, Oncobothriidae), parasite of the <b>smoothhound</b> shark, Mustelus mustelus L. (Pisces, Carcharhiniformes), was {{studied by}} transmission electron microscopy. This spermatozoon presents five regions characterized by several ultrastructural elements: an apical cone, a crested body, two axonemes of 9 +  1  pattern, electron-dense granules, a nucleus and cortical microtubules. In the present study, {{three of these}} features were {{the subject of a}} detailed attention. The first is the presence of two axonemes, which confirms that the Tetraphyllidea, Oncobothriidae possess two axonemes whereas the Tetraphyllidea, Phyllobothriidae possess only one axoneme. The second is the presence of one crested body, a criterion homogeneous in the Tetraphyllidea but heterogeneous among the different orders of Cestoda. The third is the number and the disposition of cortical microtubules. These three criteria seem to be interesting for phylogeny...|$|R
40|$|The hyoid arch is {{critical}} in expanding the oral cavity during feeding and ventilation in fishes. The elements of the hyoid arch vary widely in morphology among fish taxa. The hyoid arch is medial to the jaws and {{is made up of}} paired hyomandibular cartilages (HY) dorsally, paired ceratohyal cartilages (CH) ventral to the HY, and a single, medial basihyal cartilage (BH) that interconnects the two sides. As the jaws open, the CH-BH complex is depressed expanding the floor of the oral cavity. The coracohyoideus muscle pulls the BH ventroposteriorly, which in turn swings the CH ventroposteriorly. As the coracohyoideus muscle depresses the BH, the CH experiences substantial bending forces. Because of their critical role in the feeding mechanism, the various shapes of the hyomandibular cartilages among species are likely adapted for different feeding behaviors. The hyoid arch of suction feeders experiences larger forces during rapid hyoid depression and are expected to have robust hyoid elements to withstand muscular forces and strong intraoral negative pressure generated during suction. Bite feeders are expected to have relatively more gracile elements, since strong, rapid jaw adduction that does not involve the hyoid arch is more critical to prey capture. The goal of this project was to test for possible form-function relationships among four shark species with different feeding styles. Shape differences were analyzed using 2 D geometric morphometrics in white-spotted bamboo sharks (Chiloscyllium plagiosum, suction feeder), sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus, bite feeder), dusky <b>smoothhound</b> sharks (Mustelus canis, bite feeder), and spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias, bite and suction feeder) to quantify the relationship between the morphology of the hyomandibular cartilage and the feeding mechanism. Landmarks and semilandmarks were digitized on images of the HY. Principal components analysis and canonical variate analysis were applied to distinguish the shapes of elements and to determine changes among different species. While dogfish, which uses both suction and bite to feed, have the most robust HY, bamboo sharks, which only use suction to feed, have the most gracile HY. Bamboo and <b>smoothhound</b> sharks are similar in having a process near the each end of the HY on the posterior/anterior side. The HY of sandbar sharks has a convex curve that bulges outward, while the HY of the other species are relatively straight. Thus, the morphology of the HY does not correspond to feeding style in these four species as expected, but rather may be associated with three-dimensional movements of the hyoid arch during feeding...|$|R
40|$|Two {{new species}} of Calicotyle (Monocotylidae: Calicotylinae) are {{described}} from elasmobranchs in the western Gulf of California. Calicotyle californiensis n. sp. is described from a single specimen collected from a gray <b>smoothhound</b> shark (Mustelus californicus, Carcharhiniformes: Triakidae). It is distinguished from its congeners by the combination of having vaginal pores opening within the intercecal space, distal regions of the vaginae twisting, proximal regions of the vaginae fusing medially to form a kidney bean-shaped structure, and a relatively long male copulatory organ recurving three times and passing between the distal penis bulb and the seminal vesicle. Calicotyle urobati n. sp. is described from 16 specimens collected from at least the cloaca and rectum of the round rays Urobatis halleri and Urobatis maculatus (Rajiformes: Urolophidae). It is distinguished from its congeners by the combination of having vaginal pores opening outside the intercecal space and proximal regions of the vaginae terminating {{at the level of}} the ceca. Members of Calicotyle have not been reported previously from the eastern Pacific Ocean or from these hosts. In the past, species of Calicotyle have been distinguished based primarily on the shape and length of the male copulatory organ and hamuli. Divisions of the vaginae and the positions of the vaginal pores are also useful in distinguishing members of the genus...|$|R

40|$|Demersal {{sharks and}} rays are common yet {{vulnerable}} components of the bycatch in tropical bottom-trawl fisheries. Little {{is known about the}} elasmobranch assemblages associated with most of these fisheries, particularly within the eastern tropical Pacific. This study characterized the elasmobranch assemblage associated with the shrimp trawl fishery along the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. Between August 2008 and August 2012, 346 trawl hauls were conducted at depths of 18 – 350 m. These hauls resulted in a sample of 4564 elasmobranchs from 25 species and 13 families. The Panamic stingray (Urotrygon aspidura), rasptail skate (Raja velezi), brown <b>smoothhound</b> (Mustelus henlei), and witch guitarfish (Zapteryx xyster) accounted for more than 66 % of the elasmobranch abundance within the bycatch. Depth was the main factor influencing the elasmobranch assemblage; species richness was significantly higher at depths < 100 m than at other depths. Two groups of elasmobranchs were identified: the first was found in shallow waters (< 50 m), and the second was observed at depths of 50 – 350 m. Sex and size segregation patterns are also influenced by depth.

Age and growth of 106 male and 114 female starry smooth-hound sharks (Mustelus asterias) were estimated by counting band pairs on unstained sectioned vertebrae. Growth curves were fitted to the length-at-age data using the von Bertalanffy and Gompertz models. The 1 -parameter von Bertalanffy-L 0 provided the best fit for males (L∞ = 104 cm TL, L 0 = 30 cm TL and estimated K = 16 0. 224) and females (L∞ = 133 cm TL, L 0 = 30 cm TL and estimated K = 0. 136). Longevity was estimated to be 11. 8 and 20. 2 years for males and females respectively. The length weight relationship is also presented for 304 male and 424 female M. asterias.

40|$|Abstract Cartilaginous {{fish are}} the oldest extant jawed {{vertebrates}} {{and the oldest}} line to have placentae. Their pivotal evolutionary position makes them attractive models to investigate the mechanisms involved in the maternal-fetal interaction. This study describes the tissue expression of the cytokine interlukin- 1 (IL- 1) α, IL- 1 β and its specific membrane receptor, IL- 1 receptor type I (IL- 1 R tI) in a placental cartilaginous fish, the <b>smoothhound</b> shark, Mustelus canis. The presence of this cytokine {{has been reported in}} many mammalian placentae, {{as well as in the}} placenta of a squamate reptile and this study extends these observations to the cartilaginous fishes. The uteroplacental complex in M. canis consists of a yolk sac modified into a functional yolk sac placenta and complimentary uterine attachment sites. Immunohistochemistry for IL- 1 α, IL- 1 β and the receptor reveals leucocytes of both the mother and fetus to be positive, as well as the apical aspect of paraplacental cells and the apical vesicles in the umbilical cord epithelium. Yolk sac endoderm is also positive with all the stains while the ectoderm is positive only for IL- 1 α. Immunoreactivity in the uterine epithelium was obtained for IL- 1 α and the receptor. The egg envelope is always negative. In light of the recent finding of IL- 1 β gene in a cartilaginous fish and of the high level of conservation of proteins implicated in IL- 1 action, our data suggest that IL- 1 system is a key mediator of the materno-fetal interaction since the oldest extant placental vertebrates. </p...|$|R

Techniques used were transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry to investigate the tissue expression of the cytokines interlukin 1 (IL- 1) α, IL- 1 β, its specific membrane receptor, IL- 1 receptor type I (IL- 1 R tI) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). In addition the uteroplacental complex has been profiled as to the diversity of its glycosylation, which was found to be as complex as that found in both reptilian and mammalian placenta. Immunostaining of the uteroplacental complex for IL- 1 α, IL- 1 β, IL-R tI revealed by binding leucocytes of both the mother and fetus. Yolk sac endoderm was also positive for all the epitopes studied while ectoderm was positive only for IL- 1 α. Immunoreactivity in the uterine endometrium was obtained for IL- 1 α and its receptor while the egg envelope was always negative. Placenta and SST were positive for MIF and IL- 1 receptor. The present findings on the expression of the interleukin system and MIF in the uteroplacental complex and SST suggest that these cytokines are involved in evolutionarily conserved immunological mechanisms that anticipate the presence of paternal and fetal antigens in maternal tissues...|$|R

40|$|Global {{trends in}} commercially {{valuable}} teleost fisheries point to substantial deterioration in population size, offering limited potential for increased harvests. Consequently {{a shift in}} focus towards alternative fisheries has increased fishing effort towards targeting chondrichthyans as a possible solution to meet global demands. The life-history traits of chondrichthyans make them poor candidates for resolving economic and nutritional security as these make them particularly vulnerable to anthromorphic influences. Current fisheries management approaches based on centralized government intervention have proved inadequate. This failure of current management approaches is often linked with poor co-operation by industry with government when collecting fishery-dependent data. As management decisions are based on quantitative estimates from fishery assessment modes data collected are often of poor quality. Co-management with its implied power-sharing arrangement between government and fishing communities has been proposed as a more realistic alternative. The motivation within industry to collect high quality data can only be created {{with a feeling of}} ownership. The decline in linefish species in South Africa has led to increased exploitation of demersal sharks such as Mustelus mustelus. Their status as one of the target and by-catch species of South Africa's shark fisheries necessitated resource assessment. Age, growth, maturity and mortality calculations for M mustelus were made from data collected from 1983 - 2006. The maximum observed age for M mustelus was 25 years. Estimated von Bertalanffy growth parameters from observed length-at-age for combined sexes, females and males were L∞ = 1946. 16 mm TL, K = 0. 08 year⁻', to = - 3. 63 year⁻'; L∞ = 2202. 21 mm, K = 0. 05 year⁻', to = 4. 67 years; and L∞ = 1713. 19 mm TL, K = 0. 08 year⁻' and to = - 4. 36 years, respectively. Instantaneous total mortality (Z) was estimated at 0. 16 y⁻', whilst natural mortality (M) for M mustelus was estimated at 0. 05 y⁻'. The age and length at 50 % maturity was determined for combined sexes, females and males at 1216 mm TL corresponding to an age of 9. 93 years, 1234 mm (TL) and 10. 75 years, and 1106 mm TL and 9. 1 years respectively. The <b>smoothhound</b> shark resource off the south-eastern and south-western Cape coast was assessed by three dynamic pool models; yield per recruit, spawner biomass per recruit and an extended yield and spawner biomass per recruit. Due to the longevity of elasmobranches the per-recruit model was extended over a 20 year time-frame to simulate resource responses to management options. Fo. 1 was estimated as 0. 034 year⁻' and F MAX was estimated as 0. 045 year⁻'. FsB 50 was estimated as 0. 031. The extended per-recruit model tested the outcome of different management scenarios, Size and effort control showed the least probability of pristine biomass falling below 20 % of current levels in 20 years (where selectivity was set at 3 years). The replacement yield model showed that the average catches over the past decade are 2. 5 times higher than the replacement yield is on the South Coast and 1. 30 on the West Coast. A more realistic level optimising yield would be at 0. 05 with a selection pattern at 3 years, where the probability of the biomass falling to below 20 % of pristine pre-exploited levels in twenty years becomes negligible. A comparison of the models showed that current catches need to be halved for exploitation of <b>smoothhound</b> sharks to be sustainable. The results of this study indicate a need for a management intervention for M mustelus in South Africa with regards to potential overexploitation and collection of quality data for further assessments. A demersal identification key was developed as part of this study, which should aid monitoring officials in accurately identifying shark logs for collecting data. This study showed how adopting a management plan with the inclusion of comanagement concepts would improve the quality of data collected and increase monitoring of fishing activities. The inclusion of co-management is possible due to the unique bottle neck created by few demersal shark processing facilities actively exporting shark. A fishery management plan was compiled proposing several management options including size and effort controls...|$|R
50|$|Compared to {{the related}} grey and brown <b>smoothhounds</b> that share its range, the leopard shark has {{smaller and more}} {{numerous}} red blood cells, allowing it to process oxygen more efficiently. This may be an adaptation for foraging in deoxygenated estuary environments. Their eyes contain very few cone cells, likely due to the murky water they inhabit. Small leopard sharks fall prey to larger sharks such as the great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias) and the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). On one occasion, a sevengill shark was seen ambushing a leopard shark on a tidal mudflat in Humboldt Bay, striking with such momentum that the larger predator momentarily beached itself. Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Phyllobothrium riseri, Lacistorhynchus dollfusi and Paraorygmatobothrium barber, {{as well as the}} copepods Echthrogaleus eoleoptratus and Achtheinus oblongatus.|$|E
50|$|Fish make up some 90% of the blacktip shark's diet. A {{wide variety}} of fish have been {{recorded}} as prey for this species: sardines, herring, anchovies, ladyfish, sea catfish, cornetfish, flatfish, threadfins, mullet, mackerel, jacks, groupers, snook, porgies, mojarras, emperors, grunts, butterfish, tilapia, triggerfish, boxfish, and porcupinefish. They also feed on rays and skates, as well as smaller sharks such as <b>smoothhounds</b> and sharpnose sharks. Crustaceans and cephalopods are occasionally taken. In the Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey of the blacktip shark is the Gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), followed by the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). Off South Africa, jacks and herring {{are the most important}} prey. Hunting peaks at dawn and dusk. The excitability and sociability of blacktip sharks makes them prone to feeding frenzies when large quantities of food are suddenly available, such as when fishing vessels dump their refuse overboard.|$|E
50|$|From birth, leopard sharks form large schools {{generally}} segregated {{by age and}} sex, {{which may}} intermingle with grey or brown <b>smoothhounds</b> (Mustelus californicus and M. henlei) or spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias). These schools are apparently nomadic, often appearing suddenly in an area {{for a few hours}} and then vanishing just as quickly. In captivity, larger sharks have been observed establishing their dominance over smaller individuals via light nips to the pectoral fins. During summer days, large aggregations of mature females assemble in shallow bays and estuaries, dispersing at night. As these females follow the warmest patches of water, allowing them to raise their internal body temperatures by up to 3 °C (5.4 °F), they are speculated to be taking advantage of the heat to speed their growth and that of their gestating young. The membership of these aggregations is inconstant, with individual females periodically switching between different sites scattered over several kilometers.|$|E
40|$|The {{skeletons of}} chondrichthyans (sharks, skates, rays, and chimeras) are {{composed}} entirely of cartilage, yet must still provide the skeletal support that bone does in other vertebrates. There {{is also an}} incredible range of diversity in the morphology of the cartilaginous skeleton of the feeding apparatus in Chondrichthyans. The goal {{of this research is}} to provide insight into the morphological evolution and biomechanical function of the cranial skeleton in chondrichthyans. Differences in feeding style likely change with the gross morphology of the ten skeletal elements of the shark feeding apparatus, since these elements are common to all shark species. In chapter one, to increase our understanding of how the feeding skeletal morphology has evolved with the of feeding style of sharks, the length, width, and angles of the elements of the feeding apparatus are measured in four species (white-spotted bamboo, Chiloscyllium plagiosum; spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias; sandbar, Carcharhinus plumbeus; and dusky <b>smoothhound,</b> Mustelus canis). These species encompass a wide phylogenetic range, and include suction and bite feeders as well as two different orientations of the hyomandibula, the major jaw supporting element. A principle components analysis is used to identify relationships among the skeletal elements by species, and linear regressions are then used to test the effect of hyomandibula length on the other morphological variables. Strong relationships were discovered between the length of the hyomandibula and the lengths of all other skeletal elements and the angle of the hyomandibula. The bite feeders have longer elements and appear to maximize the size of the oral cavity, allowing larger prey to be swallowed. Suction feeders have shorter elements, which restrict the size of the oral cavity and mouth opening, but can concentrate suction forces. Based on the strong relationship between hyomandibula length and angle on feeding morphology, the mechanical properties of the hyomandibular cartilages in the same four shark species is investigated in chapter two. Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus, a measure of stiffness, and Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio, a measure of three-dimensional shape change, of the hyomandibular cartilages are compared. While Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio is similar among the species, Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus increases with mineralization and is larger in the suction feeders. Though sharks have a cartilaginous skeleton, some species have higher mineralization of elements that are under higher stress. ...|$|R
40|$|I {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen influence the distribution and abundance of elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays) in Tomales Bay, California. I captured elasmobranchs monthly (September 1990 -April 1992) on longlines set in the bay. A Poisson regression under generalized least squares {{was used to determine}} that temperature and salinity were the most important factors determining the distribution and abundance of the three most commonly captured species; bat ray, Myliobatis californica, leopard shark, Triakis semifasciata, and brown <b>smoothhound</b> shark, Mustelis henlei. Females of all three species were more abundant than males throughout the bay, and were most abundant in the warmer more saline inner bay. All three species left Tomales Bay in late fall as water temperatures in the bay dropped below 10 - 12 °C, and returned in early spring after temperatures rose above 10 °C. The oxygen consumption of bat rays, Myliobatis californica, was determined at 8, 14, 20, and 26 °C. Mean, standard, mass-independent metabolic rates (MO 2 in mg O 2 •kg- 0. 67 •h- 1) of unacclimated rays at each temperature were significantly different from one another. MO 2 was extremely temperature sensitive from 20 - 26 °C (Q 10 = 6. 62), and moderately sensitive at the upper (20 - 26 °C: Q 10 = 1. 85) and lower (8 - 14 °C: Q 10 = 2. 23) temperature ranges. The effects of four temperatures (8, 14, 20, 26 °C) on blood oxygen equilibrium curves of the bat ray, Myliobatis californica, was investigated. Blood oxygen equilibrium curves at all temperatures were hyperbolic (n 50 < 2), with high affinity (low P 50), large Bohr factors (0 = - 0. 45 to - 0. 52), high blood oxygen carrying capacity (CBO 2 = 6. 8 to 9. 06), and very large non­-bicarbonate buffering capacity (β = - 14. 25 to - 16. 43). CBO 2, 0, and β are among the largest measured in a poikilothermic elasmobranch. Affinity decreased with increasing temperature except at 26 °C. The affinity shift at 26 °C and a concomitant 25 % drop in CBO 2 at this temperature suggests a hemoglobin heterogeneity. Blood oxygen equilibrium curves were temperature insensitive betw en 8 - 14 °C and 20 - 26 °C and most sensitive between 14 - 20 °C, the temperature range in which bat rays are most commonly found in Tomales Bay. Bat rays appear capable of tolerating anoxia and hypercapnia (low P 50, n 50, and high β), and sustaining high activity levels (high CBO 2, 0, and β) by virtue of their unique hematological characteristics...|$|R
40|$|In chapter 1 I {{describe}} the population dynamics of an understudied species of gulper shark, Centrophorus uyato (common name, the Little Gulper), {{found in the}} Northern Gulf of Mexico. Sharks in the family Centrophoridae are mid-sized, demersal fish, with seven species identified in North American waters. These deepwater species {{can be difficult to}} study due to the extreme depths at which they occur. During four longlining cruises from 2012 - 2014, 593 sharks were landed, predominantly in the Mississippi Canyon off the Louisiana coast. Mean depth of capture was 290 m. Supplementing these data are catch records for C. uyato from a second series of cruises east of these stations. These data suggest the Little Gulper displays sexual dimorphism in its population size structure, similar to other elasmobranchs. Length frequency distributions, sex ratios by length, and length-weight curves were similar for both catch series, however females comprised a greater fraction of the catch from Mississippi Canyon stations compared to those further east. The high incidence of females in the region may indicate the use of Mississippi Canyon as a nursery for C. uyato, and the species 2 ̆ 7 tendency to sexually segregate at some point in its life history. A high number of large, pregnant females, along with observations of recently delivered animals, was noted at the Mississippi Canyon sites. Little Gulper sex ratios by length exhibited a characteristic 2 ̆ 2 notch 2 ̆ 2, indicative of a low female-to-male ratio at intermediate lengths, then a reversal to female dominance at the largest sizes captured. I modeled this curve under various assumptions of growth, mortality, and longevity for the species. The combination of the von Bertalanffy growth parameter, K, and the total instantaneous mortality rate, Z, that best fit the data suggests a population of slow growing, long-lived animals with a differentially higher growth rate for males. In chapter 2, I examine species associations among elasmobranchs in the Northern Gulf of Mexico in relation to depth of capture. From 2011 - 2014, 3609 sharks, comprising 31 species in 10 families, were landed on five long-lining cruises throughout the Northern Gulf and along the West Florida Shelf. Stations were grouped a priori according to depth into one of three categories, based on pre-existing divisions in the station data: 0 - 73 m (shallow), 110 - 146 m (intermediate), and 183 m or greater (deep). Using a non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance (NP-MANOVA) and a pairwise test found I found significant differences in species composition among all three depth groupings. Gulf <b>Smoothhound</b> (Mustelus sinusmexicanus) and Atlantic Sharpnose (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae) contributed most to the differences, and also accounted for over 65...|$|R
