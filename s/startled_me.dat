500|$|Many reviews {{commented on}} the reveal of the {{documentary}} crew. E! Online named the reveal one of the [...] "Best TV Moments of the Week". Verne Gay of Newsday called the scene a [...] "historic" [...] moment for the show. Serrigran wrote that, between Jim and Pam fighting, and the cameramen making an appearance, the scene was [...] "a lot to take in". However, she felt that the scene was properly done. Jason Hughes of The Huffington Post called the reveal a [...] "huge" [...] and [...] "shocking" [...] moment. Tedder called the reveal [...] "something that we've never seen before on The Office." [...] He admitted that, [...] "the last five minutes of this episode genuinely <b>startled</b> <b>me,</b> which is an impressive feat for a series on its ninth and final season." [...] Porter called the shots with Brian [...] "good" [...] because it reaffirmed that the camera crew was a character, {{one that had been}} {{an integral part of the}} show. Wilcox wrote that Brian's appearance was a [...] "weird turn", and that it was [...] "kind of funny" [...] that the first time a member of the camera crew intervened with the characters was when Pam needed comforting and not [...] "one of Dwight or Michael's dozens of near-death experiences." [...] Poniewozik enjoyed the reveal of the documentary crew. However, he wrote that, [...] "I don't know if I'm going to like the idea of making Brian an actual player in the events, if indeed that's where the show is going." [...] Adams, on the other hand, said that the reveal of the cameramen was [...] "a Big Moment for The Office, but it has a hollow ring to it" [...] because the cameramen had never before interacted with the members of the office before. Campbell wrote that [...] "the show played its documentary crew trump card WAY [...] too early" [...] and noted that the crew had never intervened in past events that were on the same level as Pam crying.|$|E
2500|$|William Boyd-Carpenter {{corresponded with}} the last empress of Russia, Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse). [...] "In early 1895 she wrote to William Boyd-Carpenter, who as Bishop of Ripon was also court {{chaplain}} to her grandmother Queen Victoria, that she was trying hard {{to come to terms}} with external trappings of her new faith. â€˜Now that I am more used to hear the Russian language I can understand the service so much better, and many things have become clear to me and comprehensible which at first rather <b>startled</b> <b>me.</b> [...] The singing is most beautiful and edifying, only I miss the sermons, which are never preached in the Imperial chapels..." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to Dickinson's return to writing, {{the album was}} also notable for its number of co-written pieces, in contrast to its predecessor, with five of the eight tracks being collaborative efforts. According to Harris, this was probably because they [...] "spent more time checking up on each other to see what everybody else was up to, {{just to make sure}} the story fitted properly and went somewhere." [...] To make sure each song fit with the record's concept, the band drew up a basic outline for the story, which Harris states [...] "didn't make the actual writing any easier ... I probably took longer over the writing I've done on this album than any I've done before. But the stuff we all started coming up with, once we'd agreed that we were definitely going for a fully fledged 'concept' album, really <b>startled</b> <b>me.</b> It was so much better than anything we'd done in ages..." ...|$|E
