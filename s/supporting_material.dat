Bridges simply copied one of Randel's previously published maps, which were in the public domain, without access to the <b>supporting</b> <b>material</b> Randel had accumulated, introducing errors as he did so, some of them possibly intentional, since he was legally bound not to copy the map exactly.

It takes around one and half hours for Objet 350 Connex 3 and around two hours for Agilista to print the soft actuators. The connectors and base were printed by Objet 350 Connex 3. After printing, the actuators fabricated by Agilista were put inside water {{to dissolve the}} <b>support</b> <b>materials.</b> For the actuator fabricated by Objet 350 Connex 3, we removed the <b>support</b> <b>material</b> inside the groove at the bottom side (Fig. 2 b) to allow air passing through.

Therefore, we did not remove all the <b>support</b> <b>materials</b> from the chambers and the actuator could be inflated. In fact, the actuator responded faster with <b>support</b> <b>material</b> inside the chambers compared to the actuator with empty chambers because less air was required to inflate the chambers.

However, tree-ring expert Mike Baillie would give credit to Velikovsky after disallowing the impossible aspects of Worlds in Collision: [...] "However, I would not disagree with all aspects of Velikovsky's work.

But fundamentally, Velikovsky did not understand anything about comets... He {{did not know about}} the hazard posed by relatively small objects... This failure to recognize the power of comets and asteroids means that it is reasonable to go back to Velikovsky and delete all the physically impossible text about Venus and Mars passing close to the earth... In other words, we can get down to his main thesis, which is that the Earth experienced dramatic events from heavenly bodies particularly in the second millennium BC." ...|$|E

Also, the fossils, geological deposits, and landforms in Earth in Upheaval, which Velikovsky regards as corroborating the hypothesis presented in Worlds in Collision have been, since their publication, explained in terms of mundane noncatastrophic geologic processes. So far, the only piece of the geologic evidence which has shown to have a catastrophic origin is a [...] "raised beach" [...] containing coral-bearing conglomerates found at an elevation of 1,200 feet above sea level within the Hawaiian Islands. The sediments, which were misidentified as a [...] "raise beach", are now attributed to megatsunamis generated by massive landslides created by the periodic collapse of the sides of the islands. In addition, these conglomerates, as many of the items cited as evidence for his ideas in Earth in Upheaval are far too old to be used as valid evidence supporting the hypothesis presented in Worlds in Collision.|$|E

40|$|Biofilms are sessile {{microbial}} communities {{attached to}} a surface, and offer a multitude of benefits to various biotechnological applications, such as anaerobic digestion. Therefore, engineering systems to promote biofilm formation is becoming increasingly desirable in the biotechnology sector. This thesis aimed to promote biofilm formation from the robust model methanogen, Methanosarcina barkeri, onto polymer <b>support</b> <b>materials</b> as a strategy for optimising the anaerobic digestion of domestic wastewater in peri-urban areas. A first step in this direction {{was to understand the}} effect of the <b>support</b> <b>material</b> on the biofilm-forming capabilities of M. barkeri. Various techniques were used throughout this thesis to show that the choice of <b>support</b> <b>material</b> was an important environmental factor in triggering different physiological responses from M. barkeri during biofilm formation. DLVO modelling, surface characterisation and static adhesion assays revealed the important role of the physicochemical surface properties of M. barkeri and the six <b>support</b> <b>materials</b> for initial microbial adhesion. M. barkeri was shown to exhibit different abilities to attach to the <b>support</b> <b>materials,</b> with the type of material strongly influencing the extent of initial attachment. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, zeta potential analysis and fluorescence microscopy suggested that significant modifications to the cell surface occurred in response to attachment to a favourable <b>support</b> <b>material</b> (PVC), with increased levels of cell surface polysaccharides detected in biofilms attached to PVC compared to PETG. Furthermore, microbial attachment to PVC caused a significant higher relative abundance of proteins involved in methanogenesis, metabolism, cell wall biogenesis and EPS production compared to biofilms attached to PETG. The results from this thesis suggest that M. barkeri showcases different physiological responses for biofilm formation depending on the <b>support</b> <b>material.</b> Therefore, the choice of <b>support</b> <b>material</b> is an important design parameter for retaining microbial biomass within AD reactors, and should be considered in future design frameworks for high rate anaerobic digestion. ...|$|R
