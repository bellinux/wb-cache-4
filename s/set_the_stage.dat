5|$|By 1931, many Duval County {{residents}} were warming {{to the idea}} of merging municipal and county governments to reduce bureaucracy, corruption and weak management. As a result, in 1932, citizens of both cities voted for the annexation of South Jacksonville into Jacksonville. While full city-county consolidation was voted down, the efforts of the 1930s <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> for further attempts, ultimately resulting in the 1968 Jacksonville Consolidation.|$|E

The opening of Lougheed Highway in 1953 made the city more accessible and <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> for residential growth. In 1971, Coquitlam and Fraser Mills were amalgamated, which gave the city a larger industrial base. The mill closed in 2001, and is now rezoned into a residential area.|$|E

5|$|Doge Domenico Contarini (10431071) had a {{relatively}} uneventful reign, healing the rift between the Doge and his subjects and regaining territory {{that had been}} lost in the east to the Kingdom of Croatia in the years following the deposition of Otto Orseolo. However, one fact remained: based on their actions {{in the first half of}} the 11th century, the majority of the people of Venice were clearly not in favor of having a royal hereditary class. This reality, coupled with the fresh memories of power-hungry Doges, <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> for Domenico Selvo.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his return}} to California, Col. Alexander was {{appointed}} president of a board appointed by the U.S. Congress to study the potential of irrigating the San Joaquin Valley, Tulare Valley, and Sacramento Valley. The board, which {{became known as the}} Alexander Commission, conducted a survey of the California Central Valley throughout the summer and fall of 1873. The Commission's report declared that large-scale irrigation was possible and that much land could be reclaimed from the swamps around the Sacramento River. The report was not initially acted upon, but was the first professional survey of the valley and <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> for further development.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} {{staff from}} previous Metroid games – including Yoshio Sakamoto, Makoto Kano and Gunpei Yokoi – returned to develop Super Metroid {{over the course}} of two years, with half a year earlier to gain approval for the initial idea. The developers wanted to make a true action game, and to <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> for Samus's reappearance. The gameplay focuses on exploration, with the player searching for power-ups that are used to reach previously inaccessible areas. It features new concepts to the series, such as the inventory screen, an automap, and the ability to fire in all directions.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{intended}} to make Sawyer look like less of a belligerent, as he had generally acted as the antagonist in previous episodes. It also <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> for the love triangle between Kate, Sawyer, and Jack. The episode was first broadcast in the United States on November 10, 2004, earning 18.44 million viewers. It received mostly positive reviews, although a few reviewers discussed aspects of the episode that they felt did not blend in well {{with the rest of}} the episode and series.|$|E

5|$|A speaker for the Anti-Saloon League, Barkley co-{{sponsored}} the 1916 Sheppard–Barkley Act which banned alcohol {{sales in}} Washington, D.C. It {{was passed in}} 1917. He sponsored {{an amendment to the}} Lever Food and Fuel Act forbidding the use of grain – rendered scarce by World War I and a poor harvest in 1916 – to make alcoholic beverages. The amendment passed the House, but a conference committee amended it to allow production of beer and wine. Both measures increased Barkley's national visibility and <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> for future prohibition legislation, including the Eighteenth Amendment. By 1917, the state Democratic Party was divided over prohibition, and the prohibitionist faction tried to enlist Barkley for the 1919 gubernatorial race. The Memphis Commercial Appeal noted in late 1917 that Barkley had not declined the invitations, but his continued silence reduced the prohibitionists' enthusiasm. He also showed little interest in the faction's attempts to recruit him to challenge incumbent anti-prohibition Senator Ollie James in the 1917 Democratic primary.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 Synge left Paris {{and moved}} to London. He had written two one-act plays, Riders to the Sea and The Shadow of the Glen, the {{previous}} year. These met with Lady Gregory's approval and The Shadow of the Glen was performed at the Molesworth Hall in October 1903. Riders to the Sea was performed at the same venue in February the following year. The Shadow of the Glen, under the title In the Shadow of the Glen, formed part of the bill for the opening run of the Abbey Theatre from 27 December 1904 to 3 January 1905. Both plays were based on stories that Synge had collected in the Aran Islands, and Synge relied on props from the Aran Islands to help <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> for each of them. He also relied on Hiberno-English, the English dialect of Ireland, to reinforce its usefulness as a literary language, partly because {{he believed that the}} Irish language could not survive.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, {{banks were}} {{deregulated}} in Iceland. This <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> for banks to upload debts when foreign companies were accumulated.

It {{is estimated that}} the three major banks held foreign debt in excess of €50 billion, or about €160,000 per Icelandic resident, compared with Iceland's gross domestic product of €8.5 billion. As early as March 2008, the cost of private deposit insurance for deposits in Landsbanki and Kaupthing was already far higher (6–8½% of the sum deposited) than for other European banks.

He {{remained in}} that division, which supported Washington's army, until, {{during a period of}} great scarcity of medical and surgical supplies for the sick and wounded, McKnight went with other surgeons and physicians to North Castle, New York with Washington's army when the Battle of White Plains began in October 1776. The Continental Army lost the battle, and the British took Fort Washington and Fort Lee, which pushed Washington's ragged army south toward New Jersey in December 1776, which <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> for the Battle of Trenton.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} leg in Lyon, Barcelona fell behind to a seventh-minute free kick from Juninho, only for Thierry Henry to equalise halfway through the second half, giving Barcelona an away goal to take back to the Camp Nou. They needed a win or a no-score draw to {{guarantee}} passage, but a 4–1 half-time lead <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> for a convincing 5–2 win. Two first-half goals from Henry and one each from Lionel Messi and Samuel Eto'o were followed by goals from Jean Makoun and Juninho {{either side of the}} interval to reduce Lyon's deficit. However, a goal from Seydou Keita in the fifthminute of injury time secured a 6–3 aggregate win and passage to the next round.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{possession}} of the second half, the Terrapins were forced to punt after a run attempt for loss, a false start penalty, and two incomplete passes. The Maryland defense took the field and stopped a Clemson drive. On the first play of their second series, wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey executed a reverse to gain 76yards before being stopped at the Clemson four-yard line. This set up a short Chris Turner touchdown pass to receiver Torrey Smith, and shifted the game's momentum in favor of Maryland. In the fourth quarter, three completions to Danny Oquendo <b>set</b> <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> for a one-yard rush into the endzone by Da'Rel Scott. In the second half, the Maryland defense allowed Clemson just 31rushing yards and zeropoints, compared with 204rushing yards and 17points in the first half.|$|E
