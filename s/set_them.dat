The economic impoverishment of the Malays which <b>set</b> <b>them</b> apart from the better-off Chinese also fanned racial sentiments.|$|E

5|$|Animals as a {{category}} have several characteristics that generally <b>set</b> <b>them</b> apart from other living things. Animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular (although see Myxozoa), which separates them from bacteria, archaea, and most protists. They are heterotrophic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and algae. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and fungi by lacking cell walls.|$|E

Similarly amongst the multiple vernacularsFrench, English and Occitanthere was not a unifying literature. French was the lingua franca of the secular elite and Latin or the church.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{contemporary}} Procopius in the De Bello Gothico (the section of the De Bellis regarding the Gothic War), Justinian resented the takeover by the Gepids of the formerly Roman city of Sirmium in 537, {{which may have been}} voluntarily surrendered by the Ostrogoths to create difficulties for the Byzantines. The Ostrogoths were also occupied with the war in Italy and sought to retain their possessions in the peninsula. Sirmium's takeover was followed in 539 by a bloody confrontation between the Gepids and the Byzantines that had cost the latter the life of Calluc, their Master of the Soldiers, and also the loss to the Gepids of Dacia ripensis (Serbia) and Singidunum (Belgrade). Because of this, Justinian ended the alliance that had bonded the Gepids and Byzantines, and had ceased paying tributes to the Gepids, finding an enemy to <b>set</b> <b>them</b> against in the Lombards.|$|E
5|$|By the end {{of their}} active use in 1902 {{together}} they had fired 1540 rounds in practice, though not all at full power as they are recorded as firing under 300 effective full charges. By then the wheels were significantly rotted and the ammunition limbers had become unserviceable. Less wheels, the guns were removed from the fort in 1909; Adelaide's city council then <b>set</b> <b>them</b> in Brougham Gardens, North Adelaide. Both were returned to the fort in 1976 and remounted on restored carriages of the original design. They are the only two guns of their type remaining in Australia. The southern gun (Number 463) fired three blank charges in 1980 to mark the centenary of the first firing at the fort. This same gun is fired regularly by the volunteers of the Fort Glanville Historical Association (FGHA).|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} French lookouts at Santo Domingo had spotted Duckworth {{approaching}} from the southeast, {{it was too}} late for Leissègues to escape. Sailing with the wind westwards along the coast, Leissègues formed a line of battle to meet the approaching British squadron, which had split into two divisions. Although his divisions separated during the approach, Duckworth's lead ships remained in a tight formation and successfully engaged the head of the French line, targeting the flagship Impérial. Under pressure, the French squadron broke apart with the British isolating and capturing three ships before concentrating on the main combat around the French flagship. Severely damaged and surrounded, Leissègues drove Impérial ashore to avoid capture. The remaining French ship of the line, Diomède, followed him. Although most of the crew of these ships scrambled ashore, British boarding parties captured both vessels and <b>set</b> <b>them</b> on fire. The only French ships to escape the battle were three smaller warships, which Duckworth's squadron had ignored; they eventually returned to France.|$|E

5|$|If {{forced to}} assault a castle, {{there were many}} options {{available}} to the attackers. For wooden structures, such as early motte-and-baileys, fire was a real threat and attempts would be made to <b>set</b> <b>them</b> alight {{as can be seen}} in the Bayeux Tapestry. Projectile weapons had been used since antiquity and the mangonel and petraria– from Roman and Eastern origins respectively– were the main two that were used into the Middle Ages. The trebuchet, which probably evolved from the petraria in the 13thcentury, was the most effective siege weapon before the development of cannons. These weapons were vulnerable to fire from the castle as they had a short range and were large machines. Conversely, weapons such as trebuchets could be fired from within the castle due to the high trajectory of its projectile, and would be protected from direct fire by the curtain walls.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the Spanish missionary Fray Alonso de León {{reported}} that about eighty families in San Mateo Ixtatán {{did not pay}} tribute to the Spanish Crown or attend the Roman Catholic mass. He described the inhabitants as quarrelsome and complained that they had built a pagan shrine in the hills among the ruins of pre-Columbian temples, where they burnt incense and offerings and sacrificed turkeys. He reported that every March they built bonfires around wooden crosses about two leagues from the town and <b>set</b> <b>them</b> on fire. Fray de León informed the colonial authorities that the practices of the natives were such that they were Christian in name only. Eventually, Fray de León was chased out of San Mateo Ixtatán by the locals.|$|E

They face a new threat {{in the form of the}} Saint Rose Crusaders: humans with special powers who desire to conquer the world and create a utopia while taking over the remaining Chimera Animas. Berry Shirayuki becomes the sixth Mew Mew and temporarily takes Ichigo's place as the leader. Berry is the first Mew Mew to be infused with the DNA of two endangered species, the Andean mountain cat and the Amami rabbit. As one of the strongest Mew Mews, Berry is targeted by two of the Crusaders, who attack her at school. Ichigo returns to provide assistance during this battle. For their final attack, two Crusaders hypnotize the citizens of Tokyo and <b>set</b> <b>them</b> against the Mew Mews. Berry and her childhood friend Tasuku Meguro use their new-found feelings of love to reverse the hypnosis and cause a change of heart in the Crusaders.|$|E

5|$|Intergem {{rocked the}} gem trade by {{marketing}} the Yogo as the world's only guaranteed untreated sapphire. By 1982, {{the practice of}} routinely heat treating gems had become {{a major issue in}} the industry. At the time, 95percent of all the world's sapphires were being heated to enhance their natural color. Thai traders had even purchased large quantities of naturally colorless Sri Lankan sapphires, known as geuda, and heated them to an artificial blue. A problem with the practice was that heated gems often fade over time, though trained gemologists can detect a heated gem with 95percent accuracy. Intergem's marketing of guaranteed untreated Yogos <b>set</b> <b>them</b> against many in the gem industry. In 1985 there was a movement in Pennsylvania to require disclosure that a gem had been treated. Intergem's strategy resulted in large numbers of gem professionals visiting Yogo Gulch.|$|E
5|$|On 11 March 1970 a large protest {{took place}} outside the North Vietnamese and PRGSV embassies, as protesters demanded Viet Cong troops {{withdraw}} from Cambodia. The protests turned chaotic, as protesters looted both embassies and <b>set</b> <b>them</b> on fire, alarming Sihanouk. Sihanouk, {{who was in}} Paris at the time, contemplated between returning to quell the situation, and visiting Moscow, Beijing, and Hanoi. He opted for the latter, thinking that he could persuade its leaders to recall Viet Cong troops to their jungle sanctuaries, where they had originally established themselves between 1964 and 1969. Five days later, Oum Mannorine, the half-brother of Sihanouk's wife Monique, was summoned to the National Assembly to answer corruption charges. On that night after the hearing, Mannorine ordered troops under his command to arrest Lon Nol and Sirik Matak, but ended up getting arrested by Lon Nol's troops instead. On 18March 1970 the National Assembly voted to depose Sihanouk, allowing Lon Nol to assume emergency powers.|$|E

In the spring of 1768, the spinning jennies at Peel's factory were blamed for job losses. The factories and Hargreaves' nearby house were the targets of a riot, destroying the spinning jennies within– along with some of Peel's own inventions. In reaction, Peel moved his manufacturing away from Lancashire. He decided on Burton-upon-Trent where he built three mills, including cutting a canal for one.|$|E
