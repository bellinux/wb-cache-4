5|$|During the Industrial Revolution, the Slea was canalised in 1794 and the Sleaford Navigation Company {{constructed}} {{offices and}} wharves along Carre Street. The canal brought trade, while the Gothic-fronted gasworks on Eastgate lit the town from 1839. Benjamin Handley and Anthony Peacock financed and {{benefited from the}} navigation and founded the bank that took over Alvey's House on Northgate and later added a Baroque extension; Henry Handley, a Member of Parliament, is commemorated by the Handley Memorial on Southgate, a Gothic monument {{in the style of}} an Eleanor Cross. During the 1850s, the railways arrived and the station was built in a Gothic style. Sleaford's agricultural location and its new transport links encouraged seed trading and malting in the late 19th century: the <b>seed</b> <b>merchant</b> Charles Sharpe's house, The Pines, is on Boston Road. The massive Bass and Company maltings complex, constructed in brick off Mareham Lane between 1892 and 1905, is grade II* listed and has a frontage more than 1,000 feet long.|$|E

50|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} local architect John Douglas and built in 1898. St Werburgh Street had been widened in the mid-1890s, and Douglas designed a terrace that was built around 1895-97, which consisted of shops and a bank {{on the east side}} of the street, numbered 2-18. Widening the street had opened up the view of Chester Cathedral from Eastgate Street, but beyond the terrace the view was partly obscured by structures belonging to the business of Dicksons, <b>seed</b> <b>merchants</b> and nurserymen. Douglas purchased the site to the north of the terrace and designed St Oswald's Chambers to be built in line with the terrace, and in a similar style, to enhance the view towards the cathedral.|$|R

A daughter, Louisa Winifred, was born in 1880, and in the same year he was appointed art master at Oundle.|$|R
50|$|Heirloom {{tomatoes}} {{are becoming increasingly}} popular, particularly among home gardeners and organic producers, since they tend to produce more interesting and flavorful crops {{at the cost of}} disease resistance and productivity. The definition of an heirloom tomato is vague, but unlike commercial hybrids, all are self-fertile varieties that have bred true for 40 years or more. Quite a few <b>seed</b> <b>merchants</b> and banks provide a large selection of heirloom seeds. Home cultivars are often bred for flavor to the exclusion of all other qualities, while commercial cultivars are bred for factors like consistent size and shape, disease and pest resistance, suitability for mechanized picking and shipping, and ability to ripen after picking. Hybrid plants remain common, since they tend to be heavier producers, and sometimes may combine unusual characteristics of heirloom tomatoes with the ruggedness of conventional commercial tomatoes.|$|R
50|$|Whiting's {{business}} as a corn and <b>seed</b> <b>merchant,</b> precluded him from an offered engagement by Yorkshire.

He was admitted to the Chalmers University of Technology where he earned his Master's degree and a Doctorate on leaving in 1896. Dalén was much the same type of inventor as Gustaf de Laval, not afraid of testing [...] "impossible" [...] ideas, but Dalén was much more careful with the company economy. The products should have a solid market place before he introduced a new product.|$|R
2500|$|Born at Linlathen, Broughty Ferry in 1861, [...] George Peddie Miln {{trained in}} a Dundee seed warehouse, the {{traditional}} Scottish {{training for a}} young man with ambition in the seed trade. He moved to Chester and ran one of its old established <b>seed</b> <b>merchants</b> before joining Gartons Limited as its first Managing Director in 1898. He was a member of Her Majesty's Board of Agriculture Seeds Advisory Council during the first World War. Both the Seeds Act 1920 and the formation of the National Institute of Agricultural Botany came about with his considerable encouragement during his three-year presidency of the Seed Trade Association of the United Kingdom. Of his eleven children, five trained in the seed trade. He was a Justice of the Peace in the City of Chester, a Fellow of the Linnean Society {{and a member of the}} Council of the Royal Agricultural Society of England. He died aged 68 following an unsuccessful operation.|$|R
50|$|In the 1890s, Samuel Ryder {{started to}} sell packets of seeds through the post, priced at one penny each. Other <b>seed</b> <b>merchants</b> also made postal sales, but their packets {{were much more}} expensive. He started selling {{from his home in}} St Albans, which had good {{mainline}} railway connections. He kept his stock in the garden shed of his terraced house on Folly Lane, and was assisted by his wife and daughter. The packets would be posted each Friday so that his customers, working men, would receive them for their time off on Saturday afternoons. The business grew rapidly and Ryder became wealthy. Eventually, the business moved to a large packaging workshop on Holywell Hill, employing around 100 staff. The art deco seed hall is now a Café Rouge restaurant. He established a separate herb business, Heath and Heather, with his brother James in 1922 and in 1924, the company moved to a former hat factory, which had a floor area of some 24000 sq ft.|$|R

30|$|Finally, as an {{indicator}} that relatively high and clean technology outcomes can arise from research in what is not normally considered a high technology industry, namely agriculture, we turn to recent developments {{that will have a}} major contribution to the moderation of global warming from high fossil fuel energy intensity by replacing it with agriculturally-derived Biofuel. Decades of research at the world-leading Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research (IGER) at Plas Gogerddan on the Cambrian Coast a few miles north of Aberystwyth have been devoted to the apparently prosaic aim of improving cattle and sheep fodder. After lengthy experimentation and some false moves in the knowledge exploration and exploitation processes, IGER in the 1980 s came up with a global winner in fodder technology. This is a cross-bred rye grass product, the original variant of which was named AberDart. IGER patented this ryegrass because it is no ordinary grass. It is, indeed a supergrass, otherwise known as SugarGrass. It earns a royalty of £ 100, 000 per year from <b>seed</b> <b>merchants</b> throughout the UK.|$|R
50|$|The first Royal Horticultural Society Great Spring Show {{was held}} in 1862, at the RHS garden in Kensington. Before this date the RHS had held flower shows from 1833 in their garden in Chiswick, which {{themselves}} had been preceded by fetes. The Kensington Garden was chosen as a site because the flower shows in Chiswick were experiencing falling visitor numbers due to problems such as poor transport links. The Great Spring Show was held at Kensington for twenty-six years but in 1888 the RHS decided to move the show {{to the heart of}} London. The site chosen was the Temple Gardens, situated between the Embankment and Fleet Street, which had a recorded history dating back to 1307 and which were said to date {{from the time of the}} Knights Templar. The roses for which these Temple Gardens were famous were alluded to in Shakespeare's Henry VI Part 1. Using two marquees requisitioned from the old Kensington shows the 1888 show was a success with exhibits from both amateurs and commercial firms. By 1897 five marquees were being used with many of the best known plant and <b>seed</b> <b>merchants</b> being attracted to the event including Suttons and Sons.|$|R

Perennial grassland represents 40 % {{of the total}} agricultural land utilized by the EU. SAGES uses conventional breeding and the natural biodiversity of Europe's grasslands to develop high quality forage grasses adapted to diverse abiotic stresses encountered throughout Europe. SAGES uses new technology and unique opportunities provided within Lolium and Festuca species to "dissect" the complex traits associated with stress resistance. It will help develop understanding of the physiological mechanisms involved, and will provide genetic markers to select gene combinations governing desirable traits for future use in cultivar production. The new cultivars will contain functioning stable gene combinations designed to improve productivity and persistency and reduce costs of fertilizer, irrigation, and resowing. Increased productivity will benefit incomes and help maintain fragile rural communities and keep people on the land...|$|R
