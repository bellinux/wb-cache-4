40|$|Abstract — Nanosilica is the {{extremely}} fine silica {{that has been}} used for years as cement admixture both in the oil field and in construction and civil engineering industries. Because of its extremely fine nature and high reactivity pozzolanic material, nanosilica has been used to improve slurry impermeability and the mechanical properties of the hardened material. Using nanosilica in slurry composition, improved reological and mechanical properties of cement <b>slurry</b> and <b>set</b> cement. With the adoption of very fine silica particles in cement matrix, porosity and permeability significantly were declined 33. 3 % and 99 % respectively and compressive strength grew from 1486 psi to 3801 psi. Finally the proper amount of nanosilica in slurry composition is presented. The novel slurry formulation with low porosity and permeability and high compressive strength, is suitable in zones where the possibility of gas migration is very high.

50|$|A chopper pump is {{operated}} by a drive unit (e.g. electric motor, hydraulic motor, PTO), which turns the impeller and the cutting system. An open impeller design is used to successfully pass the macerated solids or thick <b>slurry.</b> A <b>set</b> of hardened steel cutters is installed externally to the pump suction in order to macerate all solids prior to entering the hydraulic parts of the pump. A chopper pump {{should not be confused}} with a grinder pump, which uses its impeller as part of the cutting mechanism. Grinder pumps are typically used for light weight sewage applications, whereas chopper pumps are used for tough solids handling applications. The chopping system consists of a set of rotating cutters that are keyed to the shaft and work in conjunction with the stationary cutters, which are bolted to the suction plate. A system of mechanical seals are used to prevent the pumped liquid from entering the motor. The pump can either be connected to a pipe, flexible hose or lowered down a guide rail so that the pump sits on a coupling foot (aka base elbow), thereby connecting it to the discharge pipe.|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThe {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} and develop aplite-based geopolymer as an alternative material for Portland cement. This was done by conducting a series of experiments using an Ultrasonic Cement Analysis (UCA) on different recipes. In {{order to get the}} desired results, the recipes were modified after each experiment. When the final recipe was found, several Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) tests were conducted to verify the obtained results from the UCA. The reason for wanting to develop this geopolymeric material, is to find an alternative to Portland cement for plug and abandonment operations. Portland cement is the most common sealant used for Plugging and Abandonment (P&A) operations. However, when it comes to high temperatures and corrosive environments it has its weaknesses. So if geopolymers are more resistant in these cases, and may be produced cheaper and do less impact on the environment, then {{this would be a good}} development for the industry. After series of experiments the results suggested that a high silica/aluminum ratio was needed to develop strength. The increase of concentration of the alkali solution also improved the strength. However, a too high content of NaOH gave poor results, and might be explained by excess Na+ ions that weakened the geopolymer framework. After modifying the recipe and removing metakaolin a recipe was developed that achieved a compressive strength of 4200 psi in the UCA, and 5700 psi by UCS tests. The results suggest that an elevated curing temperature and pressure increases the compressive strength of the mentioned geopolymer. They also indicate that a higher Solid – Liquid Ratio (SLR) will reduce the time for the <b>slurry</b> to <b>set.</b> All the experimental work was done at the University of Stavanger in the well cement lab, and the concrete lab...|$|R
40|$|During a well {{cementing}} {{special place}} {{belongs to the}} cement slurry design. To ensure the best quality of cementing, {{a thorough understanding of}} well parameters is essential, as well as behaviour of cement slurry (especially at high temperatures) and application of proven cementing techniques. Many cement jobs fail because of bad job planning. Well cementing without regarding what should be accomplished, can lead to well problems (channels in the cement, unwanted water, gas or fluid production, pipe corrosion) and expensive well repairs. Cementing temperature conditions are important because bot-tomhole circulating temperatures affect slurry thickening time, arheology, set time and compressive strength development. Knowing the actual temperature which cement encounters during placement allows the selection of proper cementing materials for a specific application. Slurry design is affected by well depth, bottom hole circulating temperature and static temperature, type or drilling fluid, slurry density, pumping time, quality of mix water, fluid loss control, flow regime, settling and free water, quality of cement, dry or liquid additives, strength development, and quality of the lab cement testing and equipment. Most Portland cements and Class J cement have shown suitable performances in geot-hermal wells. Cement system designs for geothermal wells differ from those for conventional high temperature oil and gas wells in the exclusive use of silica flour instead of silica sand, and the avoidance of fly ash as an extender. In this paper, Portland cement behaviour at high temperatures is described. Cement <b>slurry</b> and <b>set</b> cement properties are also described. Published in literature, the composition of cement slurries which were tested in geothermal conditions and which obtained required compressive strength and water permeability are listed.

40|$|At Argonne National Laboratory, we have {{developed}} chemically Bonded phosphate ceramic (CBPC) technology to stabilize the U. S. Department of Energy`s problem mixed waste streams, for which no other stabilization technology is suitable. In this technology, solid waste is mixed with MgO and reacted with aqueous solutions of phosphoric acid or acid phosphates at room temperature to form a <b>slurry</b> that <b>sets</b> in {approx} 2 h into a hard and dense ceramic waste form. Initial studies involved stabilizing the surrogate waste streams and then testing the waste forms for leaching of contaminants. After achieving satisfactory performance of the waste forms, we next incorporated actual waste streams at bench scale and produced waste forms that were then tested with the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP). This presentation deals with stabilization of soil contaminated with Cd, Cr, Pb, Ag, Ba, and Hg, and of low-level radioactive wastewater. To enhance the contaminant levels in the soil, we further spiked the soil with additional amounts of Cd, Cr, Pb, and Hg. Both the soil and the wastewater were incorporated in the same waste form by stabilizing them with the CBPC process. The waste forms had a total waste loading of {approx} 77 wt. % and were dense with an open porosity of 2. 7 vol. % and a density of 2. 17 g/cm{sup 3 }. Compression strength was 4910 psi. The TCLP results showed excellent immobilization of all the RCRA metals, and radioactive contaminant levels were below the detection limit of 0. 2 pCi/mL. Long-term leaching studies using the ANS 16. 1 procedure showed that the retention of contaminants is excellent and comparable to or better than most of other stabilization processes. These results demonstrate that the CBPC process is a very superior process for treatment of low level mixed wastes; we therefore conclude that the CBPC process is well suited {{to the treatment of}} low-level mixed waste streams with high waste loading...|$|R
40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. Bibliogr. s. [412]. Cementing {{jobs are}} a very {{important}} element of drilling technology considering {{the completion of a}} given field. The selection of an appropriate recipe for sealing slurry is a challenge for the cementing services and research units. Both fresh and <b>set</b> <b>slurry</b> should meet a number of technological requirements. Various chemical, physical and mechanical properties of the ground and rock mass media to a different degree influence the technological parameters of the injected fluid. The sealing slurries have to meet certain criteria if the high efficiency of works is to be provided. The first of them is the criterion of physicochemical congruence with the environment. The second condition stems from the criterion of pumping the slurry. It is realized by selecting an appropriate rheological model and rheological parameters of the sealing slurry. The third requirement is connected with the need of providing suitable strength and durability of hardened sealing slurries {{as a result of the}} physicochemical processes. The fourth condition should account for the economy and ecology factors. The selection of recipes for sealing slurries should not be accidental or an output of unfniished laboratory tests. The correct sealing and reinforcing of the rock mass are prerequisites of further engineering works performed in the wellbore. The results of laboratory experiments on the concentration of ash from the fluidized-bed combustion of lignites on rheological parameters of fresh sealing slurries based on drilling cement class G (HSR) Dyckerhoff (API Class G HSR - Black Label) for various water/cement ratios are presented in this paper.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{document}} the rheological measurements made for Sludge Batch 3 (SB 3) and the blend of SB 3 with Sludge Batch 2 (SB 2). These measurements were primarily made on Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) products, i. e. melter feeds. Some measurements were made on SB 2 / 3 blend Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) products. Measurements on radioactive SB 3 and SB 2 / 3 samples have been limited to sludge characterization. SB 2 / 3 measurements studied the impact of changing the SRAT acid addition strategy on the SRAT and SME product rheology. SB 2 / 3 measurements also studied the impact of changing the waste loading target (sludge oxides content in glass) of the SME product. SB 3 measurements studied the impact of changes in the wash end point and acid addition strategy on the SME product (melter feed) rheology. A summary of the significant findings is given below: SB 3 radioactive sludge and blended SB 2 / 3 radioactive sludge were less viscous than SB 2 radioactive sludge. SB 2 / 3 b lend sludge is more viscous than SB 3 sludge. SB 3 simulant SME product rheology was strongly impacted by changing the noble metal concentrations to more closely match those of the qualification sample. This reduction in noble metals produced a lower pH product that was also considerably less viscous. Increased acid addition in the SB 2 / 3 SRAT generally led to less viscous simulant SRAT products. This trend did not persist in the SME products. SME products became more viscous when increased acid was used in the SRAT cycle from 135 per cent up to 170 per cent of stoichiometry, then became less viscous as total acid was increased further to 185 per cent. A significant increase in hydrogen generation occurred between 170 per cent and 185 per cent. The impact of acid addition on SB 3 SME products was also variable. The impact of waste loading changes from 31 to 35 to 40 per cent on SB 2 / 3 simulant SME products led to more viscous melter feeds as waste loading increased at constant wt. per cent total solids. The slurry pH seemed to be having a significant effect on the rheological variations within a set of similar simulant samples. The most viscous <b>slurry</b> in a <b>set</b> often had an intermediate pH in the 5 - 8 range. Rheological differences were seen as a function of wash endpoint with simulants. The Case 7 d SB 2 / 3 SME product was more viscous than the less-washed Case 6 b SME product. The more-washed SB 3 simulant SME products that started at 20, 000 mg/kg sludge nitrite were more viscous than the less washed SB 3 simulant SME products that started at 27, 000 mg/kg sludge nitrite...|$|R
40|$|The WTP pipe {{plugging}} issue, {{as stated}} by the External Flowsheet Review Team (EFRT) Executive Summary, is as follows: “Piping that transports slurries will plug unless it is properly designed to minimize this risk. This design approach has not been followed consistently, which will lead to frequent shutdowns due to line plugging. ” A strategy was employed to perform critical-velocity tests on several physical simulants. Critical velocity {{is defined as the}} point where a stationary bed of particles deposits on the bottom of a straight horizontal pipe during slurry transport operations. Results from the critical velocity testing provide an indication of slurry stability as a function of fluid rheological properties and transport conditions. The experimental results are compared to the WTP design guide on slurry transport velocity in an effort to confirm minimum waste velocity and flushing velocity requirements as established by calculations and critical line velocity correlations in the design guide. The major findings of this testing is discussed below. Experimental results indicate that the use of the Oroskar and Turian (1980) correlation in the design guide is conservative—Slurry viscosity has a greater affect on particles with a large surface area to mass ratio. The increased viscous forces on these particles result in a decrease in predicted critical velocities from this traditional industry derived equations that focus on particles large than 100 m in size. Since the Hanford slurry particles generally have large surface area to mass ratios, the reliance on such equations in the Hall (2006) design guide is conservative. Additionally, the use of the 95 % percentile particle size as an input to this equation is conservative. However, test results indicate that the use of an average particle density as an input to the equation is not conservative. Particle density has a large influence on the overall result returned by the correlation. Lastly, the viscosity correlation used in the WTP design guide {{has been shown to be}} inaccurate for Hanford waste feed materials. The use of the Thomas (1979) correlation in the design guide is not conservative—In cases where 100 % of the particles are smaller than 74 m or particles are considered to be homogeneous due to yield stress forces suspending the particles the homogeneous fraction of the <b>slurry</b> can be <b>set</b> to 100 %. In such cases, the predicted critical velocity based on the conservative Oroskar and Turian (1980) correlation is reduced to zero and the design guide returns a value from the Thomas (1979) correlation. The measured data in this report show that the Thomas (1979) correlation predictions often fall below that measured experimental values. A non-Newtonian deposition velocity design guide should be developed for the WTP— Since the WTP design guide is limited to Newtonian fluids and the WTP expects to process large quantities of such materials, the existing design guide should be modified address such systems. A central experimental finding of this testing is that the flow velocity required to reach turbulent flow increases with slurry rheological properties due to viscous forces dampening the formation of turbulent eddies. The flow becomes dominated by viscous forces rather than turbulent eddies. Since the turbulent eddies necessary for particle transport are not present, the particles will settle when crossing this boundary called the transitional deposition boundary. This deposition mechanism should be expected and designed for in the WTP...|$|R
