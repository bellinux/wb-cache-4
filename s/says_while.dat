25|$|Lois learns her father's forces {{destroyed}} New Krypton. She is {{kidnapped by}} Lucy {{and taken to}} Sam's secret base. There, Lois argues with her father, saying the Kryptonians {{think of him as}} a genocidal maniac. In the war between New Krypton and Earth, Supergirl finds them and threatens to kill Sam. Lois stops her, saying her father will be judged for his war crimes. Sam takes a gun and commits suicide. Later, Lois visits the imprisoned Lucy. She expresses disbelief on what her sister has become. Lois <b>says</b> <b>while</b> she will not miss her father, she will miss her sister.|$|E
500|$|The {{dialogue}} that the Beast <b>says</b> <b>while</b> {{negotiating with the}} Axe Gang for killing the Landlady and Landlord – [...] "...then young friend, I will make an offer you cannot refuse", is a reference of the dialogue from the movie The Godfather. Also, the Landlady's comment to Brother Sum – [...] "We brought a gift you cannot refuse" [...] is an obvious parody of the same, to which Sum replies (in the dubbed version of the film), [...] "Ha! With the Beast on our side, we shall see for whom the bell tolls", {{a reference to the}} 1943 film.|$|E

For the {{storytelling}} of what Gore’s memory was like of growing up on the farm, some of this 8mm stuff that I shot is very impressionistic. And for some of his memories of his son’s accident, these grainy black-and-white stills... have a feel that contrasted very beautifully with the crisp hi-def HD that we shot. Every format was used to its best potential. Some of the footage of Katrina has this blown-out video, where the [...] is just blasted, and it looks real muddy, but that too has its own kind of powerful, impactful feeling." ...|$|E

500|$|Hurley {{worries that}} the Hatch {{implosion}} turned Desmond into the Hulk, a Marvel Comics character who turned large and green upon being exposed to Gamma rays. The Bible verses seen on Mr. Eko's stick include , which says [...] "Do not obey the lusts of sin" [...] and , which says [...] "Jesus answered, 'I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit'." [...] Hurley's numbers are also partially visible. Dominic Monaghan as his character Charlie, <b>says,</b> <b>while</b> {{trying to figure out}} who Locke needs to speak to: [...] "Trees? Yea I heard they are wonderful conversationalists", a reference to Monaghan's work in The Lord of the Rings, in which he talks to trees.|$|E
500|$|In {{many places}} the film {{references}} classic movies, predominantly those by Disney. When Tinker Bell falls on Donkey {{and he says}} [...] "I can fly" [...] and people around including the Three Little Pigs say [...] "He can fly, he can fly"; this is a reference to Disney's Peter Pan. This scene is also {{a reference to the}} Disney film Dumbo, where Donkey <b>says,</b> <b>while</b> flying, [...] "You might have seen a house fly, maybe even a super fly, but I bet you ain't never seen a Donkey fly" [...] The scene where Fiona is singing to the blue bird is a reference to Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The transformation scene {{at the end of the}} film strongly references to Disney's Beauty and the Beast.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the episode, Liz <b>says</b> <b>while</b> sleeping, [...] "No, Tom Jones, no!" [...] before waking up. This is a {{reference}} to a future plot in the episode [...] "Reaganing" [...] in which Liz is having intimacy issues because of a traumatic incident from her childhood that involved a poster of singer Tom Jones. Throughout the episode, Jack refers to the Fabian strategy, a strategy named after Roman general Fabius Maximus, which avoids direct battle in favor of attrition warfare. Jack uses the strategy as {{he does not want to}} say no to Avery or give in to her demands. In addition, Jack hails Fabius Maximus as his role model. When Carol surprises Liz at the TGS writers' room, staff writer J.D. Lutz (John Lutz) asks Carol if he is on Facebook, the latter being a social networking website. Later, Liz tells Jack not to interfere in her relationship with Carol, as she believes she has the perfect relationship with him. She reveals that she is modeling her life on that of chef Ina Garten of the Food Network show Barefoot Contessa. Jack responds by saying that Liz will never be like Garten, including the [...] "barefoot" [...] part, referring to the fact that Liz has never let anyone see her feet, which is a real life trait of Fey's.|$|E

500|$|The ZANLA and ZIPRA cadres were officially working together, but {{in reality}} the armies' {{relationship}} was fraught with tension. As well as tribal lines—ZANLA's men were predominantly Shona, whilst ZIPRA's were mostly Ndebele—there were political issues and differences of opinion regarding doctrine. ZANLA favoured a continuation of their existing Maoist tactics, spreading themselves amongst the rural people and politicising them [...] "by fair means or foul", as Wood <b>says,</b> <b>while</b> ZIPRA preferred to overtly recruit fighters and train them overseas for conventional invasions. ZIPRA's relative inactivity in the war since 1970 {{also contributed to the}} sentiment amongst some ZANLA cadres that their supposed allies in the chimurenga were not pulling their weight. As ZANLA were superior in number to ZIPRA, their men began to usurp positions of command and authority at the joint training facilities abroad, which made the strain yet more potent. The mutual ill-feeling finally boiled over into open clashes at two training camps in Tanzania, Mugagao and Morogoro, in early 1976; in one incident, 400 nationalists were killed, while in another 200 died. Despite the continued animosity, combined guerrilla groups continued to enter Rhodesia, usually made up of eight ZANLA and two ZIPRA men; according to Lockley, the ZIPRA fighters so disliked their ZANLA comrades that they would sometimes deliberately become separated, desert and go home rather than fight alongside them.|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} a brief {{introduction}} in which Eminem <b>says</b> <b>while</b> the chorus plays underneath, [...] "Yeh, it's been a ride. I guess I {{had to go to}} that place to get to this one." [...] When he begins the first verse, his lyrics threaten people who have looked down on him: [...] "You can try to read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em/ But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em." [...] On the second verse, Eminem says that he has indeed made mistakes, commenting on his Relapse album: [...] "That last Relapse CD was ehh/ Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground/ Relax, I ain't going to do that now." [...] When he says [...] "All I'm trying to say is get back, click clack, pow", a gunshot is heard. Approaching {{the end of the second}} verse, Eminem raps about his personal experiences: [...] "But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out/ Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't/ It's time to exercise these demons/ These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now." [...] After the chorus, Eminem sings a bridge and focuses on a positive change, as he says [...] "I just can't keep living this way, so starting today I'm breaking out of this cage." [...] Before the final chorus, he says that he [...] "shoots for the moon". The song features a choir composed of Kip Blackshire, Christal Garrick II, Terry Dexter, Rich King, Kristen Ashley Cole and Sly Jordan.|$|E

2500|$|The Historic American Buildings Survey has a {{positive}} aesthetic assessment of Tanner Amphitheater. Its pergola design fits well with and enhances the setting {{in which it is}} situated, the organization <b>says,</b> <b>while</b> the Neoclassical style of the columns and Rostrum bring to mind the values of strength, simplicity, and democracy. Tanner Amphitheater fit well with and reinforced the bucolic, pastoral nature of Arlington National Cemetery in the 1800s. The new amphitheater, however, signaled a reorientation of the cemetery toward a monumental, dominating style. As historian Peter Andrews put it, Arlington [...] "ceased to be a pastoral, semiprivate resting ground for the career military and instead became a national shrine." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{says that}} he moved to Kabul to build wells in {{northwest}} Afghanistan, where {{there had been a}} drought in 2000. He and others also intended to build a school for girls in Kabul. Begg <b>says</b> <b>while</b> still in the UK, he, and others, had raised money and had begun providing equipment for a school. He says he {{was in the process of}} starting the school, and intended to work in it as an aid worker. The Taliban regime opposed education for females and had not given him a licence for the school, but [...] "they didn't try to stop us either", The Taliban, he says, [...] "were more receptive to Islamic volunteers", and that the repression of women was less intense in Kabul than in other places he saw. While in Afghanistan, he bought a handgun.|$|E
2500|$|Józef Włodarski {{regards the}} treaty {{as one of}} the {{heaviest}} mistakes in Polish foreign policy towards Prussia with fatal consequences for Poland. According to Anna Kamińska, the treaty marked the point when Poland's influence on the Baltic was lost and Poland-Lithuania's position in Europe declined. Frost says that the treaty was subject to criticism of historians such as Kazimierz Piwarski, who says that the prize paid by Poland in Bromberg was unnecessarily high. According to Frost, these critics argue from a post-partition point of view, and neglect the complexity of the contemporary situation: [...] "Contemporary [...] politicians were aware of the dangers of conceding sovereignty, which they accepted not because they were stupid, indifferent, or lacking in foresight, but because the alternatives seemed more damaging to the Commonwealth's interests", he <b>says.</b> <b>While</b> Frost regards Piwarski's assertion, that the Polish decision was heavily influenced by the Habsburgs, to have merit, he also says that the Polish interest in a rapprochment with Brandenburg had already emerged in 1656, long before Lisola entered the scene.|$|E

She appeared in the film adaptation of the novel of the same name, The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, in 2005, as Bridget, one of the four female leads. Lively's performance in the film earned her a nomination for a Teen Choice Award for [...] "Choice Movie Breakout – Female. In 2006, Lively co-starred with Justin Long in Accepted, and Lively had minor roles in the horror film, Simon <b>Says.</b> <b>While</b> Accepted was not well received by critics, Lively's performance was, earning her a 'Breakthrough Award' from Hollywood Life. In 2007, she played one of the two title characters in Elvis and Anabelle as Anabelle, a bulimic girl who hoped to win a beauty pageant. Lively said of getting into character for the role that she had 'shed serious weight' for her height. Lively stated that that process was difficult for her because food is [...] "the No.1 love of my life."

2500|$|Estimates of {{the number}} of Sufis in Egypt include at least a third of the adult male Muslim {{population}} in Egypt, (six million men) being members of a Sufi order; fifteen million of the country’s roughly 80 million citizens [...] "claim" [...] Sufism [...] "as a practice", still another <b>says</b> <b>while</b> 15 million are registered as Sufis, [...] "the true figure is likely to be higher". Participation at the festivals (moulids) the Sufi orders organize, is perhaps twice that (and includes women and children). The moulids are a major manifestation of Sufi Islam in Egypt, and are held in honor of holy men and women. (In Egypt the term Moulid is not reserved for Muslim festivals and may be in honor of Christian, and until recently Jewish holy men). [...] Sufi Muslim moulids not only venerate the prophet Muhammad and his descendants (such as Hussein, the second son of the fourth Caliph Ali whose moulid in Cairo can draws crowds of more than a million people), but founders of Sufi orders, down to dozens of lesser-known sheikhs celebrated mostly in remote rural communities. The largest moulid in Egypt takes place in Tanta, the largest city in the Nile Delta, and draws an even larger number of pilgrims than hajj in Mecca. As many as three million Egyptians and other Arabs gather there every October to celebrate the life of Sayid Ahmad al-Badawi, a thirteenth-century Sufi leader. According to the Egyptian Ministry of Awqaf (Islamic charity), there are officially more than forty such annual commemorations, and the Sufi Council in Egypt lists eighty other festivals for lesser-known founders of Sufi orders.|$|E
