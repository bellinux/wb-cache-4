50|$|Society of Petroleum Engineer (SPE) has {{designed}} a new plate pack with vertical plates made of 360 {{stainless steel plates}} held by a plate <b>support</b> <b>sleeve.</b> It is arranged in parallel to the centrifuge axis. An increase in the centrifugal efficiency is obtained based on a computer simulation program ran beforehand. This is proven experimentally in which oil concentration in the effluent has decreased by about 25%. Further improvement of the plate pack {{may lead to a}} decrease of oil effluent concentration of more than 40% and seems feasible.|$|E
50|$|A {{mains socket}} mounted transformer/rectifier {{provided}} 9V DC {{to the speed}} controller board, which used tachometer feedback from the DC motor to regulate its speed. A small brass pulley drove the platter assembly using a flat rubber belt wrapped around a recessed face machined into {{the underside of the}} one-piece acrylic platter, another unconventional material chosen for its vibration dissipation qualities. The thrust element of the bearing was formed by a tungsten carbide sphere mounted in the bearing spindle pressing against a synthetic ruby cup in top of the aluminium <b>support</b> <b>sleeve</b> for the platter. The bearing was positioned close to the centre of gravity of the platter with side load being carried by a lower PTFE sleeve against the bearing spindle. The next product, referred to as the PT1, is often mistakenly assumed to be their first product. The PT1 was an easier to manufacture version of the 'Original' having the glass top plate replaced by a black painted steel plate. Later versions of the PT1 moved the motor from its original 'one o'clock' position to 'seven o'clock', {{on the opposite side of}} the spindle to the tonearm to mounted it on the top plate. This turntable was in production from 1979 until 1985.|$|E
50|$|The sample {{assembly}} {{is constructed}} of multiple cylindrical sleeves which {{are placed in}} the opening in the pressure vessel or “bomb”. The outermost sleeve is typically composed from NaCl {{which is used to}} transfer the vertical load applied from the steel piston into a confining pressure on the sample {{at the center of the}} assembly. NaCl is used since it is relatively weak and it assists in the transfer of stress. Directly inboard of the outer NaCl sleeve is a ceramic <b>support</b> <b>sleeve</b> with a graphite sleeve inside of it, which is used for resistive heating of the sample. The inner most sleeve which houses the sample along with the upper and lower alumina pistons, is commonly also composed of NaCl. In addition to this arrangement, the inner sleeve can also be composed of a ternary eutectic salt mixture which is called a molten salt cell. The advantage to the molten salt cell is the salt mixture melts at moderate temperatures which allows for a true hydrostatic pressure to be applied the sample. When using a molten salt cell it also becomes necessary to add an additional nickel capsule to contain the salt mixture in order to prevent damage to other parts of the sample assembly. Temperature is monitored by a side entry thermocouple(s) that penetrate the wall of the graphite furnace and are directly adjacent to the sample, and are typically threaded through protective mullite insulation. The deviatoric stress is transferred to the sample through the σ1 piston. This piston is orientated in series with the upper piston, sample and lower piston within the inner sleeve which all sits on top of a tungsten carbide bottom piston.|$|E

40|$|Damping seals, damping bearings, and a <b>support</b> <b>sleeve</b> are {{presented}} {{for the ball}} bearings of a high speed rotor. The ball bearings consist of a duplex set having the outer races packaged tightly within the sleeve while the sleeve provides a gap with a support member so that the bearings may float with the sleeve. The sleeve has a web extending radially between the pair of outer races and acts in conjunction {{with one or more}} springs to apply an axial preload to the outer races. The sleeves have a series of slits which provide the sleeve with a spring-like quality so that the spring acts to center the rotor upon which the bearings are mounted during start up and shut down. A damping seal or a damping bearing may be used in conjunction with the ball bearings and supporting sleeve, the damping seal and damping bearing having rotor portions including rigid outer surfaces mounted within the bore of a stator portion having triangular shaped pockets on the surface facing the rotor. Axial gates are provided between adjacent pockets in sections of the stator permitting fluid to flow with less resistance axially relative to the flow of fluids circumferentially between the rotor and the stator...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} test results of {{two types of}} total {{temperature}} probes that were used for hypersonic boundary-layer measurements are presented. The intent of each design was to minimize the total error and to maintain minimal size for measurements in boundary layers 1. 0 in. thick and less. A single platinum- 20 -percent-rhodium shield was used in both designs to minimize radiation heat transfer losses during exposure to the high-temperature test stream. The shield of the smaller design was flattened at the flow entrance to an interior height of 0. 02 in., compared with 0. 03 in. for the larger design. The resulting vent-to-inlet area ratios were 60 and 50 percent. A stainless steel structural <b>support</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{that was used in}} the larger design was excluded from the smaller design, which resulted in an outer diameter of 0. 059 in., to allow closer placement of the probes {{to each other and to}} the wall. These small design changes to improve resolution did not affect probe performance. Tests were conducted at boundary-layer-edge Mach numbers of 5. 0 and 6. 2. The nominal free-stream total temperatures were 2600 degrees and 3200 degrees R. The probes demonstrated extremely good reliability. The best performance in terms of recovery factor occurred when the wire-based Nusselt number was at least 0. 04. Recommendations for future probe designs are included...|$|E

25|$|Multi-cylinder {{hydraulic}} {{cone crusher}} is mainly composed of main frame, eccentric shaft, crushing cone, mantle, bowl liner, adjusting device, dust ring, transmission device, bowl-shaped bearing, adjusting sleeve, hydraulic control system, hydraulic safety system, etc. The electric motor of the cone crusher drives the eccentric shaft to make periodic swing movement under the shaft axis, and consequently surface of mantle approaches {{and leaves the}} surface of bowl liner now and then, so that the material is crushed due to squeezing and grinding inside the crushing chamber. The safety cylinder of the machine can ensure safety as well as lift <b>supporting</b> <b>sleeve</b> and static cone by a hydraulic system and automatically remove the blocks in the crushing chamber when the machine is suddenly stuffy. Thus the maintenance rate is greatly reduced and production efficiency is greatly improved as it can remove blocks without disassembling the machine.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{provides}} {{results of}} experimental scale model studies of functional {{characteristics of a}} check valve used in the safety system of a liquid metal cooled reactor. The proposed check valve design with a hollow ball as a blocking element {{has a number of}} substantial advantages compared with the most widely spread valves with disc type flaps used as blocking elements. The advantages are valve operation independent of functioning of other safety systems and absence of friction pairs. The need to conduct experimental studies is determined both by the novelty of the proposed check valve design and by absence of verified computational validation methods for functioning of this type of valves. In this connection, the paper presents a computational validation method for hydrodynamic parameters of the proposed check valve design and similitude parameters describing hydrodynamic characteristics of the check valve – numeric values of the similitude parameters were obtained through calculations made by the ANSYSCFX commercial hydrodynamic code. The paper describes the experimental model of the check valve with two alternative options for the blocking element – one {{in the form of a}} hollow ball in a support bowl; and another one, in the form of a semi sphere on a guide rod going through the <b>support</b> <b>sleeve</b> on the valve spindle. Provided is a brief description of the test facility.

50|$|The {{surface of}} a vinyl record is readily damaged, so aside from the outer {{cardboard}} sleeve, there is usually an inner protective cover to protect against dust and handling. This is normally shaped {{to allow it to}} readily slide within the outer cover. The inner sleeve is either thin white paper, either plain or printed with information on other recordings available from the same company, or a paper <b>sleeve</b> <b>supporting</b> a thin plastic bag. These quite often have a circular cut out so that the record label can be read without directly handling the record, though when the inner sleeve is printed with lyrics, which became quite common, then there is usually no hole. Decca Records used a system of colour-coding on these sleeves where a blue color denoted a stereophonic recording while red denoted a monophonic recording (the mono record players of the time were not always compatible with stereo records). This system was begun in the 1960s to reduce packaging costs.|$|R

A corps of light cavalry led by Antonio de Olivera followed the infantry at some distance with instructions to cover its withdrawal if the attack went bad, or to follow up the victory, if it took place. According to Alonso Vázquez, Farnese made the Walloon soldiers of the Spanish Army wear white shirts over their armors, a practise common in night attacks known as camisades, to distinguish themselves from the Walloons who fought for the Union of Utrecht. Thus the Walloons look, in his words, like [...] "a very colorful procession of clerics and sacristans".|$|R

40|$|The {{composite}} resins {{are used}} as filling material to restore tooth cavities. The polymerization shrinkage of dental resin composites bonded to cavity walls leads to shrinkage force having {{negative effect on the}} restoration-tooth interface. The cavity must resist this tensile force. In a filling the bonded resin composite is deformed by the shrinkage and causes tensile stress on the tooth. Particularly, the light-cured composites harden very fast and at the beginning cause high tensile stress. The objective of the present study is to investigate the forces arising during polymerization shrinkage of several light-cured resin composites by proving different materials and sample lengths. After preliminary tests with nine series and 80 trials no influence can be determined by the application of a <b>supporting</b> polyethylene <b>sleeve</b> as well as different irradiation times or humidity appearing. The measurements of the principal trails have been affected at a universal test machine (Instron, model 6025) between two silan-coated steel disks (diameter d = 6 mm) during a period of 360 seconds. The irradiation time of the polymerization amounts to 60 seconds. Seven light-cured composites resins Dyract (Dentsply), Spectrum TPH (Dentsply), Visio-Dispers (Espe), Visio-Molar (Espe), Charisma (Kulzer), Charisma F (Kulzer) and Durafill VS (Kulzer), with three different sample lengths (2, 4, 8 mm, 10 trials each), in total 210 measurements, are investigated. Larger sample lengths cause a significantly larger shrinkage force (u-test after MANN and WHITNEY, p < 0. 0001). This force increase is not proportional to the sample length. The lowest shrinkage force is caused by Dyract (2 mm with 14. 6 N, 4 mm with 18. 2 N, 8 mm with 24. 6 N), the highest Visio-Dispers (2 mm with 29. 9 N, 4 mm with 38. 2 N, 8 mm with 53. 2 N). The minimum tensile stress is 0. 5 MPa and the maximum tensile stress is 1. 9 MPa. The forces arising from the seven materials differ significantly. No obvious correlation of inorganic filler volume, type of fillers, Young´s modulus and consistency could be found during the polymerization. With an in vitro test, polymerizing composites resins cause a tension stress below the tensile strength of enamel. The initial shrinkage force does not appears high enough to cause damage to a prepared tooth. For future investigations a uniform testing method would be appropriate to standardize the varieties of experimental setups used in publications...|$|R
