The T Series DVD is in B&W. The film is called Хождение за три моря in Russian.Written by Khwaja Ahmad Abbas and Mariya Smirnova, the film is {{the true story of}} the Russian trader Afanasi Nikitin (died 1472), who is the second known European (after Niccolò de' Conti) to have visited India (both the north and the Deccan) and have written about the land, its people and his journey. Russian actor Oleg Aleksandrovich Strizhenov played Afanasi.Its Censor Certificate states ‘Colour, Scope’ and gives the name of its filmmakers as ‘Meera Movies’ and ‘Son?a Sansar International.’However, more excitingly, more than 25 minutes of the film are {{available}} in sharp, high quality colour and widescreen in the form of Hindi songs YouTube.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} for voxelization of implicit solids which contain <b>sharp</b> <b>details.</b> If such objects are processed by common techniques, voxelization artifacts may appear, resulting, among others, in jaggy edges in rendered images. To cope with this problem we proposed a technique called <b>Sharp</b> <b>Details</b> Correction. The main idea is to modify objects {{during the process of}} voxelization according to the representability criterion. This means that sharp edges end vertices are rounded to a curvature, which depends on the grid resolution. Thus, we obtain artifact-free voxelized solids which produce alias-free images...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel method of {{controlling}} a multi-phase fluid {{so that it}} flows into a target shape in a natural way. To preserve the <b>sharp</b> <b>detail</b> of the target shape, we represent it as an implicit function and construct the level-set of that function. Previous approaches add the target-driven control force as an external term, which then becomes attenuated during the velocity projection step, making the convergence process unstable and causing <b>sharp</b> <b>detail</b> to be lost from the target shape. But we calculate the force on the fluid from the pressure discontinuity at the interface between phases, and integrate the control force into the projection step so as to preserve its effect. The control force is calculated using an enhanced version of the ghost fluid method, which guarantees that the fluid flows from the source shape and converges into the target shape, while achieving a more natural animation then other approaches. Our control force is merged during the projection step avoiding {{the need for a}} post-optimization process to eliminate divergence at the liquid interface. This makes our method easy to implement using existing fluid engines, and it incurs little computational overhead. Experimental results show the accuracy and robustness of this technique...|$|R

40|$|The limited-view {{problem is}} studied for thermoacoustic tomography, {{which is also}} {{referred}} to as photoacoustic or optoacoustic tomography {{depending on the type of}} radiation for the induction of acoustic waves. We define a “detection region,” within which all points have sufficient detection views. It is explained analytically and shown numerically that the boundaries of any objects inside this region can be recovered stably. Otherwise some <b>sharp</b> <b>details</b> become blurred. One can identify in advance the parts of the boundaries that will be affected if the detection view is insufficient. If the detector scans along a circle in a two-dimensional case, acquiring a sufficient view might require covering more than a π-, or less than a π-arc of the trajectory depending on the position of the object. Similar results hold in a three-dimensional case. In order to support our theoretical conclusions, three types of reconstruction methods are utilized: a filtered backprojection (FBP) approximate inversion, which is shown to work well for limited-view data, a local-tomography-type reconstruction that emphasizes <b>sharp</b> <b>details</b> (e. g., the boundaries of inclusions), and an iterative algebraic truncated conjugate gradient algorithm used in conjunction with FBP. Computations are conducted for both numerically simulated and experimental data. The reconstructions confirm our theoretical predictions...|$|E
40|$|Contrast {{enhancement}} algorithms for varying {{intensity distribution}} Images creates intensity distortion in some regions, over enhancement & unnatural effects {{in other regions}} of Images. The main reason of this effect is due to not consideration of image edges & <b>sharp</b> <b>details</b> during enhancement process. On the other hand, the human visual system is more sensitive to edges and <b>sharp</b> <b>details</b> of image. In this paper we are proposing a method titled efficient contrast Enhancement using Kernel Padding and DWT with Image Fusion that Enhances the contrast of Images that has varying intensity distribution specially satellite images, preserve the brightness of images, sharpens the edges and remove the blurriness of images. Basically this is a pixel based edge guided image fusion technique. In this method LL sub band of Image DWT is processed by contrast enhancement section where based on image brightness level image is decomposed in different layers and then each layers intensity is stressed or compressed by generated intensity transformation function. The decomposed intensity layers are also processed by canny edge detection method as all the satellite images contains the noise due to atmospheric turbulence and this is Gaussian by nature. Canny edge detector is the best method for detecting edges of image {{in the presence of}} Gaussian noise. Finally the contrast enhanced images are fused according to the weight map determined by edge map of image...|$|E
40|$|Figure 1 : Our method permits {{high-resolution}} {{tracking of}} a low-resolution fluid simulation, without any visual or topological artifacts. The original simulation (a) exhibits <b>sharp</b> <b>details</b> and low-resolution banding artifacts. Smoothing the surface tracker (b) hides the artifacts but corrodes important surface features. We propose a smoothing technique (c) that preserves <b>sharp</b> <b>details</b> while selectively removing surface tracking artifacts, and a force generation method (d) that removes visual artifacts with strategically placed surface waves. Our algorithms are general and apply to both level sets {{as well as}} mesh-based surface tracking techniques. Our work concerns the combination of an Eulerian liquid simu-lation with a high-resolution surface tracker (e. g. the level set method or a Lagrangian triangle mesh). The naive application of a high-resolution surface tracker to a low-resolution velocity field can produce many visually disturbing physical and topological ar-tifacts that limit their use in practice. We address these problems by defining an error function which compares {{the current state of}} the surface tracker to the set of physically valid surface states. By reducing this error with a gradient descent technique, we introduce a novel physics-based surface fairing method. Similarly, by treat-ing this error function as a potential energy, we derive a new sur-face correction force that mimics the vortex sheet equations. We demonstrate our results with both level set and mesh-based surface trackers...|$|E
