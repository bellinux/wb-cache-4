50|$|The {{history of}} the island of Euboea is largely that of its two {{principal}} cities, Chalcis and Eretria, both mentioned in the Catalogue of Ships.

50|$|In 1867, Wales {{made its}} first major {{contribution}} to boxing, when Llanelli-born sportsman and sport organiser John Graham Chambers devised and drafted the Queensbury Rules, the basic code to which boxing still practices under to this day. Although boxing now had its legitimate code of laws, Wales would often be the location of illegal bare-knuckled fights, {{and there would be}} known mountainside locations where locals would meet to watch fights. These illegal fights were often conducted at dawn in isolated or remote areas, though they were still sometimes disrupted by the law. To evade criminal proceedings, fights were often arranged on land near county borders where jurisdiction was vague and law enforcement intermittent. In particular the area between Tafarnaubach near Tredegar and Llangynidr in Powys became the 'nursey for would-be champions' due to its proximity to the borders of three counties. Towards the end of the Victorian period several Welsh boxers, who made their name as mountain fighters, began fighting under Queensbury rules and became well known and respected sportsmen. Among their number were champion fighters, John O'Brien, Dai St. John, Redmond Coleman and butcher brothers Sam and Ivor Thomas. By the early 20th century, boxing had not advanced to a great degree in Wales, and many of the country's early professional boxers began their career fighting in booths at fairgrounds. With the popularity of the sport increasing, a <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>weights</b> and titles evolved, which allowed the emergence of working-class local heroes.|$|E

Australian Production Car Championship was first contested in 1987, with the inaugural champion determined from the results of two races held at the Winton Motor Raceway in Victoria on September 27. The first World Touring Car Championship, which was open to Group A Touring Cars, was held in 1987 concurrent to the long-running European Touring Car Championship (ETCC). Additional rounds were held outside Europe at Bathurst in Australia, Calder Park Raceway in Australia (using both the road course and the then-newly constructed Thunderdome), Wellington in New Zealand and Mount Fuji in Japan. The Drivers Championship was won by Roberto Ravaglia in a BMW M3, and the Entrants Championship was won by the Eggenberger Motorsport Ford No 7 entry, which was a Ford Sierra. Winston Cup Series underwent a large boom in popularity in the 1990s. This coincided with a decline of popularity in American Championship Car Racing. The FISA decided to separate the rally cars into three classes: Group N (production cars), Group A (modified production cars), and Group B (modified sport cars). Group B was introduced by the FIA in 1982 as a replacement for both Group 4 (modified grand touring) and Group 5 (touring prototype) cars.|$|E

In the third part I analyze one particular contract, steps involved in awarding the procurement and selection of assessment criteria. To determine the model weights I chose the method of successive weighting pattern combined with the method of allocation of 100 points. The values obtained in this way were compared with weights actually used.

40|$|Backpropagation {{learning}} algorithms typically collapse the network's structure into {{a single}} vector <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> parameters to be optimized. We suggest that their performance may be improved by utilizing the struc-tural information instead of discarding it, and introduce a framework for &quot;tempering &quot; each weight accordingly. In the tempering model, activation and error signals are treated as approx-imately independent random variables. The characteristic <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> changes is then matched {{to that of the}} residuals, allowing structural prop erties such as a node's fan-in and fan-out to affect the local learning rate and backpropagated error. The model also permits calculation of an upper bound on the global learning rate for batch updates, which in turn leads to different update rules for bias vs. non-bias weights. This approach yields hitherto unparalleled performance on the family re-lations benchmark, a deep multi-layer network: for both batch learning with momentum and the delta-bar-delta algorithm, convergence at the optimal learning rate is sped up by more than an order of magnitude. ...|$|R

Method: two specialist community palliative care teams in the South of England, 2006 / 07 were randomised to offer MAWE, or to deliver care as usual. Twenty-five patients supported by MAWE were compared with 25 patient controls. All participants were new referrals and concerned about weight loss or eating problems. Primary outcome measure: VAS <b>scales</b> <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> related distress and eating related distress were completed by patient and carer at two time points. Secondary outcome measures: At the same time points all participants were interviewed and patient participants completed the EORTC-QLQ-C 15 -PAL. Results: fifteen of the 65 recruited patients dropped out of the study, most because of death or deteriorating condition (n= 12). Selecting only patients receiving nurse-led management delayed achievement of the recruitment target. MAWE trained nurses were able to integrate the approach within their everyday practice. But enthusiastic adoption of MAWE led to contamination of the baseline data and difficulty interpreting the measures. Descriptive statistics are consistent with MAWE mitigating weight and eating related distress. Qualitative data indicate that MAWE can help with self-management <b>of</b> <b>weight</b> and eating related problems. MAWE could be refined to address issues relating to co-morbidities.
