40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of drying distillers grains plus <b>solubles</b> on cattle performance. The control diet contained no distillers grains. The six additional diets contained 35 % distillers grains that were 1) wet distillers grains plus <b>solubles</b> (WDGS), 2) dried distillers grains plus <b>solubles</b> (DDGS), 3) dried distillers grains plus wet <b>solubles</b> at time of feeding (DDG + <b>Solubles),</b> 4) dried distillers grains plus <b>solubles</b> plus water (DDGS + H 2 O), 5) modified distillers grains with <b>solubles</b> added prior to drier (MDGSPre), and 6) modified distillers grains with <b>solubles</b> added after the drier (MDGSPost). Cattle fed diets with distillers grains had greater ADG and DMI, and lower F:G than the diet with no distillers grains.

40|$|Four {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the components of distillers grains plus <b>solubles</b> in finishing beef cattle diets. Experiment 1 evaluated the effects of five composites of feedstuffs formulated to be similar in nutrient composition to DDGS on finishing performance of cattle. Experiment 2 evaluated isolating the protein from distillers grains using a feedstuff from the wet milling ethanol industry to determine the impacts of protein on the feeding value of WDGS in finishing performance of cattle. Experiments 3 and 4 evaluated the effects of protein from distillers grains with the diets used in Exp. 2 on site of digestion, ruminal VFA concentration and pH. In Exp. 1, replicating distillers grains plus <b>solubles</b> with proportions of high-protein distiller grains, corn bran, and condensed distillers <b>solubles</b> {{did not result in}} similar performance as cattle fed distillers grains plus <b>solubles.</b> Cattle consuming the CaO treated corn stover and byproducts were less efficient than cattle fed the composite with corn bran.
