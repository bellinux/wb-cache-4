6000|$|Mr. Chairman, the President {{seems to}} think that enough may be done, in the way of {{improvements}}, by means of tonnage duties under State authority, with the consent of the General Government. Now I suppose this matter of tonnage duties is well enough in its own sphere. I suppose it may be efficient, and perhaps sufficient, to make slight improvements and repairs in harbors already in use and not much out of repair. But if I have any correct general idea of it, it must be wholly inefficient for any general beneficent purposes of improvement. I know very little, or rather nothing at all, of the practical matter of levying and collecting tonnage duties; but I suppose one of its principles must be to lay a duty for the improvement of any particular harbor upon the tonnage coming into that harbor; to do otherwise--to collect money in one harbor, to be expended on improvements in another--would be an extremely aggravated form of that inequality which the President so much deprecates. If I be right in this, how could we make any entirely new improvement by means of tonnage duties? How make a road, a canal, or clear a greatly obstructed river? The idea that we could involves the same absurdity as the Irish bull about the new boots. [...] "I shall niver git 'em on," [...] <b>says</b> <b>Patrick,</b> [...] "till I wear 'em a day or two, and stretch 'em a little." [...] We shall never make a canal by tonnage duties until it shall already have been made awhile, so the tonnage can get into it.|$|E

The earliest version of the Lebor Gabála says Eochaid killed him on the English Channel, later versions adding that Niall was invading Brittany when this happened. Keating, quoting a Latin Life of Saint <b>Patrick,</b> <b>says</b> that Niall led Irish raids on Roman Britain, {{and in one of}} those raids Patrick and his sisters were abducted.

6000|$|We have thus, {{according}} to the advice of Socrates, permitted the argument to lead us whither it would. And whither has it led us? The old, savage, natural theory of ghosts and wraiths {{is that they are}} spirits, yet not so immaterial but that they can fill space, be seen, heard, touched, and affect material objects. Mediaeval and other theologians preferred to regard them as angelic or diabolic manifestations, made out of compressed air, or by aid of bodies of the dead, or begotten by the action of angel or devil on the substance of the brain. Modern science looks on them as hallucinations, sometimes morbid, as in madness or delirium, or in a vicious condition of the organ of sense; sometimes abnormal, but not necessarily a proof of chronic disease of any description. The psychical theory then explains a sifted remnant of apparitions; the coincidental, 'veridical' hallucinations of the sane, by telepathy. There is a wide chasm, however, to be bridged over between that hypothesis, and its general acceptance, either by science, or by reflective yet unscientific inquirers. The existence of thought- transference, especially among people wide awake, has to be demonstrated more unimpeachably, and then either the telepathic explanation must be shown to fit all the cases collected, or many interesting cases must be thrown overboard, or these must be referred to some other cause. That cause will be something very like the old-fashioned ghosts. Perhaps, the most remarkable collective hallucination in history is that vouched for by Patrick Walker, the Covenanter; in his Biographia Presbyteriana. {209} In 1686, says Walker, about two miles below Lanark, on the water of Clyde 'many people gathered together for several afternoons, where there were showers of bonnets, hats, guns, and swords, which covered the trees and ground, companies of men in arms marching in order, upon the waterside, companies meeting companies. [...] . and then all falling to the ground and disappearing, and other companies immediately appearing in the same way'. This occurred in June and July, in the afternoons. Now the Westland Whigs were then, as usual, in a very excitable frame of mind, and filled with fears, inspired both by events, and by the prophecies of Peden and other saints. Patrick Walker himself was a high-flying Covenanter, he was present: 'I went there three afternoons together'--and he saw nothing unusual occur. About two-thirds of the crowd did see the phenomena he reckons, the others, like himself, saw nothing strange. 'There was a fright and trembling upon them that did see,' and, at least in one case, the hallucination was contagious. A gentleman standing next Walker exclaimed: 'A pack of damned witches and warlocks, that have the second sight, the deil ha't do I see'. 'And immediately there was a discernable change in his countenance, with as much fear and trembling as any woman I saw there, who cried out: [...] "O all ye that do not see, say nothing; for I perswade you it is matter of fact, and discernable to all that is not stone-blind".' Those who did see minutely described 'what handles the swords had, whether small or three-barred, or Highland guards, and the closing knots of the bonnets, black or blue. [...] . I have been at a loss ever since what to make of this last,' <b>says</b> <b>Patrick</b> Walker, and who is not at a loss? The contagion of the hallucination, so to speak, did not affect him, fanatic as he was, and did affect a cursing and swearing cavalier, whose prejudices, whose 'dominant idea,' were all on the other side. The Psychical Society has published an account of a similar collective hallucination of crowds of people, 'appearing and disappearing,' shared by two young ladies and their maid, on a walk home from church. But this occurred in a fog, and no one was present who was not hallucinated. Patrick Walker's account is triumphantly honest, and is, perhaps, as odd a piece of psychology as any on record, thanks to his escape from the prevalent illusion, which, no doubt, he would gladly have shared. Wodrow, it should be said, in his History of the Sufferings of the Kirk, mentions visions of bonnets, which, he thinks, indicated a future muster of militia! But he gives the date as 1684.|$|E

5000|$|Artist Patrick J. Reynolds {{was born}} in New Orleans in 1963 where he began his long and {{distinguished}} career. At age 11 he began winning awards and receiving {{the respect of the}} elite of the art world. Having unlimited styles at his disposal in the art community of New Orleans, Patrick decided early on to not conform to any of them, Instead, carving out his own way creating a style never before seen.Today, Patrick is the only artist in the United States to maintain graphite block and limestone suspended in oil. As he developed the medium over time, graphite figurative romanticism was born. And one could easily say that his art will be carved into the history books and studied for generations to come.Today, Patrick pushes the envelope of his style, forever exploring the stories that can be told through art. The signature style remains evident in every new layout drawing or final masterpiece. [...] "The passion is the same" [...] <b>says</b> <b>Patrick.</b> [...] "It's a burning desire to begin a piece that has already been completed in my head. It must materialize, it must come to life."."Fanciful or not, the winged beings tell the tales that course through Reynolds' soul and spring from his fingertips." [...] Says [...]Patrick begins his pieces by grinding graphite and limestone into boiled linseed oil and varying thickness on his palette. He then uses a brush to swirl the mixture onto the board creating both texture and form. The result becomes a rock hard fine art that will last for centuries.Art collectors {{from all walks of life}} describe the work as moving, and that is what it is intended to do, move you. Rarely, if ever, does it match the couch or the curtains. Patrick's work falls into the category of generational collections. Found in some of the most prestigious corporate and family collections in the world.As a published author, of his art and writings such as Principals of Peace, Patrick continues work on new projects such as Journey of Dreams, a new book due out this summer, and Tears of a Dreamer, a book based on the philosophies of Patrick Reynolds works.
