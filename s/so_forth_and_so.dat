5000|$|Mamet's {{style of}} writing dialogue, {{marked by a}} cynical, street-smart edge, {{precisely}} crafted for effect, is so distinctive that {{it has come to}} be called Mamet speak. Mamet has recognized an association of his edgy narrative style by noting his debt to Harold Pinter, to whom he dedicated Glengarry Glen Ross. He often uses italics and quotation marks to highlight particular words and to draw attention to his characters' frequent manipulation and deceitful use of language. His characters frequently interrupt one another, their sentences trail off unfinished, and their dialogue overlaps. Moreover, certain expressions and figures of speech are deliberately misrepresented to show that the character is not paying close attention to every detail of his dialogue (e.g., or <b>so</b> <b>forth</b> instead of <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>forth).</b> Mamet himself has criticized his (and other writers') tendency to write [...] "pretty" [...] at the expense of sound, logical plots.|$|R

40|$|Guy Standing brings {{together}} evidence about precarious employment {{from across the}} world, but his argument leaves Ian Watson with some unanswered questions • DURING a decades-long period at the International Labour Organization, Guy Standing wrote a series of important studies about {{the changing nature of}} work. In the late nineties and early noughties, these writings helped shape debates in Australia about the transformation of the labour market. Standing, who spent three years at Monash University and is now professor of economic security at the University of Bath, examined various forms of security available to the workforce – job security, income security, employment security <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>forth</b> – <b>and</b> in <b>so</b> doing provided researchers in Australia with useful categories for understanding the economic restructuring of the 1980 s and 1990 s. For Standing, it is the absence of these forms of security that defines a new class, the precariat. In this book, he explores the spread of neoliberalism and the labour market dislocation and increased casualisation that followed as part of the collateral damage wrought by globalisation. Working on a broad canvas, Standing sketches the spread of insecurity across many countries and into many corners of society… Read the full article in Inside Story Photo: Martino’s Doodle...|$|R
