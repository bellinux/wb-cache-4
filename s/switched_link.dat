40|$|This paper {{develops}} a connection establishment framework for protecting connections against single-link failures using link protection at the granularity of a connection, {{referred to as}} Connection <b>Switched</b> <b>Link</b> Protection (CSLP). As a connection is routed only around a failed link, the channel assignment for the connection on the backup path of the failed link must be consistent {{with that of the}} primary path. Such a consistency is guaranteed at the time of call admission. The advantages of employing link protection at the connection level is established by comparing its performance through extensive simulations against link protection at the granularity of a fiber, referred to as Fiber <b>Switched</b> <b>Link</b> Protection (FSLP). Link protection at the connection level is shown to significantly outperform that at the granularity of a fiber, specifically when some traffic requires protection while others do not...|$|E
40|$|International audienceConnectivity, as an {{important}} property of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), was studied by many previous researchers using the geometric disk model which rests on the <b>switched</b> <b>link</b> model. Basically, shadowing and fading have so heavy impact on links {{that there are many}} unreliable links in WSNs. In this paper, we quantify the effect of the long but unreliable hops on the connectivity of WSNs. In our model, each node connects to another node in the network with a certain probability at a given time, and this probability depends on techniques of transmission, channels etc. Based on this model, an overall expression of mean node degree is deduced. Finally, both analytic and simulation results indicate that unreliable long hops can greatly enhance the connectivity of WSNs...|$|E

The maximum error of the modelling is no more than 5 %, which indicates the sufficient adequacy of the <b>switching</b> <b>link</b> as related to the evaluation of its probability-time characteristics.

30|$|The main {{advantage}} of soft <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> over hard <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> {{is a better}} guarantee in data transmission, which originates from the significantly smaller <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> delay. However, to utilize soft <b>link</b> <b>switching,</b> the hardware of user devices must be more complex and expensive {{compared to that of}} hard <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> to be able to receive signals from many transmitters simultaneously. Another problem of the soft <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> technique is the use of several channels to only support a single user device, which results in a waste of resources, an increase in the volume of data traffic, and an increase in downlink interference.|$|R
30|$|The outage {{probability}} {{is an important}} metric in wireless communication systems. To maintain the QoS, the RSS, or the SINR needs to be maintained above a certain threshold. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the {{outage probability}} with respect to three <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> schemes, which are conventional hard <b>link</b> <b>switching,</b> conventional soft <b>link</b> <b>switching,</b> and our proposed <b>link</b> <b>switching.</b>|$|R
30|$|During a hard <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> procedure, {{user devices}} cannot receive the {{signal from the}} serving transmitter, {{which leads to a}} data {{interruption}} problem and then QoS degradation. Thus, the process duration of a hard <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> scheme (i.e., <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> delay), which mainly originates from the scanning period, is an important problem in terms of guaranteeing a seamless data transmission. This problem can be solved effectively in soft <b>link</b> <b>switching.</b> In soft <b>link</b> <b>switching,</b> a user device can simultaneously communicate with two or more transmitters, including its current serving transmitter. The link between the user device and its current serving transmitter is disconnected only after it has successfully connected to the target transmitter.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{efficient}} diagnosis scheme {{to detect and}} locate the switching network defects/faults in reconfigurable array architecture. This diagnosis scheme performs the test of switching network based on the scan path and fault intersection test methodology to locate the faults occurring in the switching network. After the diagnosis of switching network, the processing element (PE) test can then be initiated through the good <b>switches</b> and <b>links.</b> Errors in testing that cause a good <b>switch,</b> <b>link</b> or PE to {{be considered as a}} bad one is called "killing error". The issue of killing error in testing is addressed and the probability of killing error for our diagnosis technique is analyzed and shown to be extremely low. The significance of this approach is the ability to detect and locate the multiple faults in <b>switches,</b> <b>links,</b> and PEs with low testing circuit overhead, and to offer the good test quality in linear diagnosis time.

30|$|This {{paper has}} {{presented}} a novel hard <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> scheme, which overcomes the drawbacks of conventional hard and soft <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> schemes, for VLC networks. The proposed scheme uses pre-scanning and predictive RSS methods {{to reduce the}} <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> delay and the unnecessary <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> ratio. In addition, the SINR and the outage probability are analyzed {{with respect to the}} <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> situation in a VLC environment. The proposed scheme achieves a lower outage probability compared to the conventional hard and soft <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> schemes. To utilize our proposed scheme, {{there is no need to}} change the hardware of the user devices and the IEEE 802.15. 7 MAC operation. Therefore, the proposed scheme is expected to be a possible approach for a practical <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> implementation. In the future, we will work on handling the increase in the overhead caused by multiple pre-scannings in our proposed scheme.|$|R

Because movable users expect a seamless connectivity experience when switching among transmitters (i.e., VLC access points) in the VLC system, fast <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> operations must be supported by the networks. This paper presents a novel hard <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> scheme for VLC networks {{with the use of}} pre-scanning and received signal strength (RSS) prediction. Our proposed scheme achieves the advantages of both conventional hard and soft <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> schemes without changing device hardware or the IEEE 802.15. 7 medium access control (MAC) protocol. To help compare our proposed scheme with conventional hard and soft <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> schemes, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), the outage probability regarding the <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> situation, and the queuing models for <b>link</b> <b>switching</b> schemes are taken into account.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} a novel monitoring trail (m-trail) approach, called Advanced Global Neighborhood Failure Localization (AG-NFL), which provides ultra-fast all-optical restoration for any shared protection scheme. In contrast with its previous counterparts, AG-NFL aims {{to identify and}} perform the proper switching action upon any single link failure rather than unambiguously localizing link failures. We identify <b>switching</b> <b>link</b> groups at each node, i. e., links whose failures {{do not have to}} be distinguished from each other, e. g., because the same switching action belongs to them. We prove that AG-NFL is NP-complete, and we propose a yet efficient heuristic to solve it. We demonstrate through simulations that localizing <b>switching</b> <b>link</b> groups instead of single link failures leads to a significantly improved m-trail performance both in wavelength resources and the number of required transponders, while signaling-free restoration is still provided...|$|R
