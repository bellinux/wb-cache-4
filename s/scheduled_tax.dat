40|$|Workers {{paying taxes}} today can derive no {{assurance}} from trust funds {{that they will}} receive benefits when they retire. Any assurance derives solely from the willingness of future taxpayers to impose taxes on themselves to pay for benefits that present taxpayers are promising themselves. This one-sided ‘compact between the generations, ’ foisted on generations that cannot give their consent, {{is a very different}} thing from a ‘trust fund. ’ It is more like a chain letter. —Milton and Rose Friedman, Free to Choose, 104 lderly entitlement programs the world over bind generation to generation through the mediation of government. The typical elderly entitlement pro-gram is financed by generation transfers, in which government taxes the young and transfers the proceeds to retirees. In the United States, retirees rely on the young for their Social Security pensions. In exchange for their taxed away earn-ings, the young are given the implicit promise that they, too, will receive a pen-sion in their retirement. One of the intrinsic defects of elderly entitlement pro-grams financed with generation transfers is that their financial health is very sensitive to demographic changes. The retirement of the baby boom generation will usher in a decreased worker-to-retiree ratio. Combined with increased life expectancies and reduced birth rates, the falling worker-to-retiree ratio is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. These demographic shifts will place elderly entitlement programs in deep financial crisis. Taking Social Secu-rity and Medicare in the United States for example, <b>scheduled</b> <b>tax</b> revenues will fall dramatically short of the resources required to pay promised benefits. Fun-damentally, the problem of financial insolvency of these programs {{lies in the fact that}} they are financed by intergenerational transfers rather than by resources based on saving and investment. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{three distinct}} although related {{issues in the}} policy history of the U. S. Social Security system. I examine the thesis that when agricultural and domestic employments were excluded from coverage in the 1935 Social Security Act, this {{was an act of}} racial bias against African-Americans. I show that this thesis is both conceptually flawed and disproven by the available empirical evidence. I examine the thesis that the Social Security program has contained or does contain gender biases against women. I show that indeed there have been numerous gendered policies in Social Security. However, contrary to the claims and assumptions of the standard thesis, these gendered policies have overwhelmingly benefited women and disadvantaged men. I examine the period between the major legislation of the 1939 Social Security Amendments and the important amendments of 1950. In the standard view, this period has generally been characterized as a time of quiescence in policymaking. About the only policy activity between these two milestones was a series of freezes in taxing policy whereby <b>scheduled</b> <b>tax</b> rate increases were not permitted to take effect. Most scholars have ignored these freezes, believing them of little significance. I argue that these rate freezes were an important reversal in existing Social Security policy. I also undertake a systematic effort {{to assess the impact of}} these policies on the financing of the program. I find that for a decade or more during these years the Social Security system was almost certainly insolvent in the long-run. The dissertation opens with a short general discussion of policy history as a discipline and the basic conceptual and theoretical context for the type of policy history pursued in this research. I then turn to a brief introduction to the Social Security program, to frame the necessary context for the more detailed work to follow. These two opening sections are followed by the three major parts of the dissertation, in which I examine each of the three indicated theses in detail...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographySpanish version availableThe 2011 - 2012 {{edition of}} Latin America and the Caribbean in the World Economy, {{which focuses on}} the theme of {{continuing}} crisis in the centre and new opportunities for developing economies, is divided into four chapters. The first chapter examines the difficult international economic situation and the outlook {{for the rest of the}} decade. The global economy is facing difficult conditions again in the second half of 2012, with the epicentre in the euro zone. A number of European economies are mired in deep recession and their governments are having serious difficulties in reconciling the need to regain growth with the urgency of reducing their high levels of deficit and debt. As a result, mounting uncertainty and turmoil are sapping a global recovery that is already the weakest in 40 years. Although the United States is performing somewhat better than the euro zone, its recovery remains fragile. Moreover, its economy could slip back into recession in the first quarter of 2013 if major <b>scheduled</b> <b>tax</b> hikes and spending cuts go ahead. Over the next few years, the developing countries, particularly China and other emerging Asian economies, will continue to be the main engine of the global economy and trade, while growth in the industrialized countries remains slow and volatile. The industrialized countries still have some way to go in reducing household and public sector debt. During this process, which could take another three to five years, financial constraints seem likely to continue, as do stringent fiscal consolidation and public debt requirements, short and erratic recoveries, high unemployment and further public sector interventions in finance and the economy. Regarding trade policy in this complex international scenario, restrictive global trade practices remain at moderate levels. However, there are significant risk factors that could increase trade restrictions. In trade negotiations, the protracted stagnation of the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization (WTO) has accentuated an already strong tendency towards negotiating preferential agreements. Much of this activity involves the economies of Asia and the Pacific. Lastly, attention is drawn to a number of recent trade disputes at WTO. Chapter II takes stock of the boom in commodity prices that began around 2003 and its evolving impact on the value of the region’s exports, drawing particular attention to the growing role of developing Asia, especially China, as a destination for commodity exports from Latin America and the Caribbean. It then examines the foreseeable impact of three scenarios (neutral, optimistic and pessimistic) in terms of commodity export prices and demand from the region’s major trading partners in 2013 - 2015, focusing on the 10 main groups of commodities (oil, copper, iron, soybean, coffee, sugar, fisheries products, meat, fruit and gas) and their derivatives, which together account for more than 40 % of the region’s total export value. The resulting projections show that, even in the pessimistic scenario, prices for the region’s main export commodities will remain above their historical averages, even though they could fall by as much as 9 % per year (especially in the case of minerals and metals). The value exported by the region will continue to rise during the next four years at annual rates ranging from 0. 7 % to 10. 5 % in the pessimistic and optimistic scenarios, respectively, and 5 % in the neutral scenario. As a result, the countries in the region will have to work harder to increase their export volumes, if they are to maintain export earnings. Chapter III looks at recent performance and the short-term outlook for trade and economic integration in the region. It analyses foreign trade trends in Latin America and the Caribbean in 2011 and 2012 by main trading partner and category of product for the region overall and for the subregions, finding a sharp slowdown starting in the second half of 2011. In fact, in 2012 exports and imports are likely to edge up by just 4 % and 3 %, respectively, owing, among other factors, to the crisis in the euro zone, weak growth in the Unites States and Japan, and modest growth in China and other emerging economies. This chapter also examines the main developments over the past 12 months with regard to the various integration processes under way in the region. On the one hand, there are no widespread moves to increase trade restrictions. On the other, some of the region’s economies are continuing to sign new trade agreements at a rapid pace with partners in the region and beyond. Lastly, a number of shifts have taken place in the region’s formal economic integration architecture. Chapter IV examines the international integration of Latin America and the Caribbean in relation to the trends discussed in the rest of the document. Three dimensions of the region’s export performance are analysed: (a) value chains, (b) employment generated by the export sector, and (c) export firms. Briefly: (a) The examination of the region’s participation in value chains looks at the role of the maquila sectors and duty-free zones, as well as trade in intermediate goods. In light of these indicators, it is concluded that, relative to other regions, particularly Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean is lagging behind in terms of integration into global value chains. (b) Employment generated directly by the export sector is analysed, as well as jobs linked indirectly to export firms. The study performed for six countries suggests that export-related employment represents a significant and growing percentage (between 12 % and 24 %) of total employment. (c) The characteristics of the region’s export firms are examined by sector, size and destination. It is concluded that the proportion of firms engaging in export activity is still very small. In most of the region’s countries, export activity is concentrated in a few firms, usually large corporations operating in the natural-resource sector. Two types of policy recommendation are offered by way of conclusion. First, it is important to develop policies for bolstering intraregional trade, which is well placed to drive a process of structural change with equity. This is because it plays an important role in export diversification, industrial development and direct and indirect job creation, and it is less concentrated than other types of trade by firm and involves a larger proportion of small and medium-sized enterprises. Second, initiatives are needed to tap the potential for trade and investment with other emerging regions, especially Asia, and to foster a quality leap in those ties. Summary. [...] I.

30|$|The {{disaggregation}} {{of direct}} taxation into <b>schedules,</b> <b>tax</b> credits {{and a part}} attributable to tax allowances showed that redistribution is effected mainly via the schedules. The redistributive effect of <b>tax</b> <b>schedules</b> {{is largely due to}} their size {{and to a lesser extent}} to their progressivity. Neither tax allowances nor tax credits influence inequality levels to any great extent. However, it should be kept in mind that the effect of tax allowances and tax credits is critically linked to the design of <b>tax</b> <b>schedules.</b> In particular, <b>tax</b> allowances and tax credits cannot, by design, have a significant impact in the context of low taxation levels. Tax allowances are progressive in a context of flat rate taxation but regressive in a progressive regime. Both tax allowances and tax credits affect inequality much less than means-tested and even non-contributory benefits. This reinforces the idea that the inequality-reducing capacity of fiscal benefits is limited.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} tension between fiscal {{decentralization}} and progressive taxation.

30|$|Another {{somewhat}} surprising {{result is}} the moderate progressivity of the <b>tax</b> <b>schedule.</b> Remember that the <b>tax</b> <b>schedule</b> captures the progressivity of the gross tax payable {{in the absence of}} allowances.

Unsurprisingly, the most progressive schedules are the ones with many tax brackets such as those in Germany, Luxembourg or France.|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of distortions from individuals competing to attain social status by using consumption signals justifies {{some measure of}} income tax as a counter-acting distortion.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the trade-off}} between the incentive effects of increased uncertainty and the welfare benefits of risk-sharing {{in the design}} of optimal <b>tax</b> <b>schedules.</b> We use numerical methods to characterise the <b>tax</b> <b>schedule</b> and to give comparative static results of changing risk aversion, uncertainty and the cost of effort. Increased uncertainty may increase effort for precautionary reasons, but leads to greater risk sharing in the optimal <b>tax</b> <b>schedule.</b> Similarly, a reduced cost of effort leads to greater risk sharing. Incentives to work are induced through punishment at low output realisations if risk aversion is high, and through reward of high output if risk aversion is low. We also consider introducing extra randomisation into the rax schedule to further incentivise individuals. This is only optimal if the form of the <b>tax</b> <b>schedule</b> is constrained, for example to be linear. ...|$|R

40|$|Progressivity in both {{marginal}} {{and average}} tax rates {{seems to be}} a universal phenomenon. Yet the optimal taxation literature does not, by and large, imply progressivity and most of the investigations of politically determined <b>tax</b> <b>schedules</b> deal with linear taxation. This paper considers the determination of the tax structure by majority rule when <b>tax</b> <b>schedules</b> are characterized by three parameters and individuals differ in ability.

Under some additional restrictions this result is extended to any (global) movement along the tax possibility frontier. The paper uses this result to demonstrate that the existence of both marginal and average progressivity of <b>tax</b> <b>schedules</b> can be explained as the outcome of a majority voting process in which the median individual is pivotal with respect to the <b>tax</b> <b>schedule</b> chosen by the political process. Marginal progressivity is more likely the stronger the right hand skewness and the larger the variance in the distribution of abilities.
