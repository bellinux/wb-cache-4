40|$|Abstract: Eco-ethological {{aspects of}} the common langur (Hanuman) <b>Semnopithecus</b> <b>entellus</b> (Dufresne) were studied between July and September 1981 {{in the rural areas}} of Keshabpur Police Station, Jessore, Bangladesh. Three {{bisexual}} troops were monitored for 355 hrs for determining group-size and composition, age-sex relationship, and other ecological and behavioural features. The average group-size was 13. 67 + 0. 00 in July and 14. 67 + 1. 33 in September. Of the major diurnal activities viz., rest, move, sit, social groom, self groom, play and feed, the Hanumans spent maximum time in sitting (44. 32 %). Dyad behaviour of the Hanumans and their relationships with other animals including man has been described. Hanumans used more than 60 species as food plants of which 43 were identified. They mostly ate vegetative plant parts (74. 88 %), thus indicating their folivorous nature. The welfare of the Hanumans has also been dealt with.

40|$|Langurs are {{wild animals}} which {{are one of}} the {{important}} groups of primates. Gray langurs are popularly known as entellus langur or Hanuman langur, which are scientifically named as <b>Semnopithecus</b> <b>entellus.</b> Two separate groups of langur inhabit at Khandagiri and Udayagiri hills located at Bhubaneswar, the capital of Orissa state. Although langurs are fond of plant materials as their food, now they are habituated with various food substances offered by tourists. The food is the only factor which makes them want to interact with human beings very closely. They maintain a systematic social life and show many intra- and interspecific behaviours. Their interaction with tourists is so friendly that it can hardly be differentiated from that of men.

40|$|The <b>Semnopithecus</b> <b>entellus</b> can be broadly {{classified}} into two morphotypes based on tail carriage, namely {{the northern and}} the southern types (NT & ST). The borderline between these morphotypes runs along the Tapti-Godavari rivers in peninsular India. However there have been anecdotal reports of range extension of NT in peninsular India. To investigate this scenario we undertook an intensive survey of S. entellus morphotypes along the borderline districts in the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The GPS coordinates of the two morphotypes were mapped using MapInfo professional software and the resulting map was compared with the map generated by Roonwal. Results indicate that NT S. entellus range limit fall further south of Roonwal’s borderline.

40|$|The {{demographic}} {{structure in}} the Hanuman langur (<b>Semnopithecus</b> <b>entellus)</b> population of Jodhpur is extreme, in that some single males monopolize harems with, on average, 25 adult females. It has been pro-posed that extratroop males, which live in all-male bands, inhabit low-quality habitats and suffer from reduced food provisioning and longer daily travel distances. To compare the resulting energetic consequences for harem holders and bachelors, I estimated their gross energy intake and daily energetic expenditures. This analysis revealed no clear-cut {{differences between the two}} classes of males in time spent feeding on provisioned food, daily path length, gross energy intake, and energy ex-penditure. Due to the small sample size and other limitations of the study design, the hypothesis under investigation can not be evaluated conclu-sively. The preliminary results suggest, however, that energy budgets of harem holders and bachelors do not differ markedly.

This study reevaluates this hypothesis to include other exogenous SRVs. New sequence information from the gp 70 (SU) -encoding region of PO- 1 -Lu shows striking similarity to the newly identified exogenous langur retrovirus, SRV- 6, recently isolated from the Hanuman Langur (<b>Semnopithecus</b> <b>entellus).</b> An unrooted, bootstrapped neighbor-joining tree derived from env gene nucleotide sequences shows PO- 1 -Lu and SRV- 6 appear more closely related genetically to SRV- 2 than SRV- 1 or SRV- 3 (M-PMV). This is also reflected in our observations that the M-PMV envelope glycoprotein precursor gPr 86 Env and gp 70 (SU) were antigenically distinct from PO- 1 -Lu, although the gp 22 (TM) glycoproteins were antigenically cross-reactive. The potential that SRV- 6 represents an exogenous form of PO- 1 -Lu that has arisen following a recent zoonosis is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Folivory, being a dietary constraint, {{can affect}} the social time of colobines. In the present study, we {{compared}} food items and activity budgets of two closely related species of colobines inhabiting South India, i. e. the Hanuman langur (Semnopithecus hypoleucos) and Nilgiri langur (Semnopithecus johnii), to determine whether folivory {{had an impact on}} social time in these species. Our study established that Nilgiri langurs were more folivorous than Hanuman langurs. Nilgiri langurs spent much less time on social activities, but more time on resting, although the social organization of S. hypoleucos was {{similar to that of the}} Nilgiri langur. The enforced resting time for fermentation of leafy food items may have reduced the time available for social interactions, which in turn affected the social time in Nilgiri langurs. By comparing the data from previous studies on other Hanuman langur species, we found that S. hypoleucos spent a similar amount of time on social activities as <b>Semnopithecus</b> <b>entellus.</b> Hence, the social behaviour of S. entellus and S. hypoleucos is phylogenetically highly conservative.

Here we describe infection by a closely related SRV- 6 {{in an isolated}} feral population of Hanuman langurs from Jodhpur in the Northwestern desert region of India. Serological analyses, using in-house ELISA and WB, genomic amplification, and sequencing of env region (gp 70 and gp 20) of the viral genome were carried out. SRV- 6 -infected langurs from the two regions were serologically cross-reactive. The env gene was used for phylogenetic analyses, being the most variable part of a retroviral genome. The surface glycoproteins (gp 70) were almost identical between the two SRV- 6 isolates and related to but distinct from equivalent regions from other exogenous SRVs. We could sequence the transmembrane glycoprotein gp 20 from SRV- 6 infecting the Jodhpur langurs, which was again shown {{to be related to}} but unique compared to the other known SRVs.

We have earlier reported a novel SRV, SRV- 6 from Indian langurs (<b>Semnopithecus</b> <b>entellus).</b> Additional sequence analyses from gp 20 transmembrane (TM) env genes of SRV- 6 and SRV- 7 {{place them in a}} separate cluster, related to but distinct from known exogenous SRVs and also close to the simian endogenous beta retrovirus, (SERV) from African baboon. Phylogenetic analyses of pol gene of SRV- 7 place it closer to SERV when the stop codons of the SERV genes are removed. On the other hand, additional sequence data from gp 70, surface glycoprotein (SU) region of the env gene of SRV- 6 suggest it is more closely related to known exogenous SRVs, (SRV- 1 to 3). It is also related to the endogenous langur virus, Po- 1 -Lu.

40|$|Social play {{is a very}} {{variable}} behaviour which includes, among others, patterns used {{in other}} functional contexts (e. g. predatory, aggressive or sexual behaviour). These patterns carry a risk of potential escalation of the play into an agonistic conflict or, at least, the risk of terminating the play interaction. Therefore, many species have evolved signals to establish a playful context. Some of the play signals could have specific metacommunicative function, i. e. to modify the meaning of actions borrowed from other contexts which immediately preceded or followed the play signal. The {{aim of this study}} was to use the sequential analysis of play behaviour in Hanuman langurs (<b>Semnopithecus</b> <b>entellus)</b> to test if some of the patterns in the play sequence serve as play signals with a metacommunicative function. I have tested whether the occurrence of patterns with potential play signal function is non- random and if there is a sequential association with actions borrowed from aggressive contexts.

Until recently it was believed to be a single species - <b>Semnopithecus</b> <b>entellus.</b> Recent molecular and morphological studies suggest that the Hanuman langurs consists of at least three species S. entellus, S. hypoleucos and S. priam. Furthermore, morphological studies suggested that both S. hypoleucos and S. priam have at least three subspecies in each. We explored the use of ecological niche modeling (ENM) to confirm the validity of these seven taxa and an additional taxon S. johnii belonging to the same genus. MaxEnt modeling tool was used with 19 bioclimatic, 12 vegetation and 6 hydrological environmental layers. We reduced total environmental variables to 14 layers after testing for collinearity and an independent test for model prediction was done using ENMTools.

40|$|The Western Ghats of {{southern}} India {{are one of}} the most important biodiversity regions in the world, not only due to their faunal diversity and abundance but also due to different habitat types, floral diversity and the presence of several endemic plant species. The rainforests in the central Western Ghats are inhabited by several primate species. We investigated the vegetation pattern and tree species occupancy of one of the prime primate habitats in the central Western Ghats. Lion-tailed Macaque (Macaca silenus), Bonnet Macaque (Macaca radiata), Hanuman Langur (<b>Semnopithecus</b> <b>entellus</b> achates) and Malabar Slender Loris (Loris lydekkerianus malabaricus) inhabit the study area. We studied the density, dominance, frequency and Importance Value Index (IVI) of different tree species, using the belt transect method on randomly selected plots covering 4. 1 ha. We found that all the plant species that emerged to be the most dominant species with high IVI in the forest were also used by the diurnal primates for foraging. Knema attenuata and Syzygium gardneri were found to be the ‘keystone’ species.

40|$|We {{studied the}} feeding ecology of 3 {{sympatric}} primate species, the lion-tailed macaque (Macaca silenus), bonnet macaque (Macaca radiata) and Hanuman langur (<b>Semnopithecus</b> <b>entellus),</b> in a {{tropical rain forest}} of the Central Western Ghats, India. Since the availability of leaves {{is much higher than}} that of fruits, we expected that the primarily folivorous langurs would use a larger number of resources than the primarily frugivorous macaques. Since fruits are a relatively total resource, unlike leaves, of which only selected parts are consumed, we expected that the primarily frugivorous macaques would use resources more proportionately than the folivorous langurs, resulting in a wider food niche breadth in macaques. We collected data on these primate species over a period of 2 years using scan sampling in a contiguous rain forest. We calculated Levin’s standardised food niche breadth for each species. Langurs used a larger number of tree species than macaques, but their niche breadth was narrower than that of macaques. The majority of their diet (over 50 %) came from only a few trees in the case of all three primate species.

Karnataka is situated in southwest India with an area of 191, 791 km(2). A total of 9697 km of vehicular survey was made from November 2001 to July 2004. We also visited 107 temples/tourist spots to determine the presence of primates. Bonnet macaques and Hanuman langurs were widely distributed, whereas rhesus macaques were not found in the state. However, bonnet macaques were absent in a few districts in the northern plains and Hanuman langurs were absent in some districts of the southern plains. A total of 205 groups of bonnet macaques and 139 groups of Hanuman langurs were sighted. The relative encounter rate of both species differed across biogeographic zones. Bonnet macaques were largely encountered in the Western Ghats and the Southern Plateau whereas Hanuman langurs were abundant in the Western Ghats and Northern Plains. We found that bonnet macaques have been eliminated from about 48 % temples/tourist spots where they occurred in the recent past. The Hanuman langur population of Dharwar-Haliyal Road was assessed during April 2003, and we found that the present population size was about 38 % of a previous survey in 1961.

We discuss the attitudes of locals towards crop damage inflicted by the common langur (<b>Semnopithecus</b> <b>entellus).</b> We analysed local deterrent methods for reducing crop damage and the management strategy adopted by the Forest Department to conserve langurs. Thus, we investigated how demographic variables {{were associated with the}} perceptions of locals towards crop damage and conflicts. A total of 27 different crop species were cultivated across the villages, among which langurs mostly damaged fruits. Although most damage occurred during the fruiting season langurs damaged crops throughout the year. Around 55 % of the respondents reported that the local deterring methods were effective but that they affect their children’s education and economy. Furthermore, almost 59 % of the respondents were tolerable towards the langur damage. People living in villages with a high langur population and where weak conservation methods were used reported greater crop damage than their counterparts. A linear regression analysis revealed that the occupation, landholding status, and ethical and religious beliefs of the people included in this study has a significant impact on their attitudes regarding conservation. Therefore, there is an urgent need to implement conservation measures to mitigate human-langur conflicts as well as to conserve common langurs in areas where humans and langurs coexist. </p...|$|R

Jackal dietary habits reflected {{the availability of a}} wide variety of food items and the differential vulnerability of prey. Potential animal and plant foods available to jackal varied because of their seasonal variability. About 32. 69 % scats were found to have only one prey item, whereas 48. 08 % of scats represented two prey items. Overall, it was found that the large mammalian prey was the most important food item which was significantly supplemented by vegetative material particularly Zizyphus spp. Amongst mammalian prey, the percentage frequency of occurrence (percentage±SE) of Chital Axis axis was 25. 93 ± 2. 84, Buffalo Bubalus arnee bubalis was 27. 16 ± 2. 98 followed by Indian Hare Rufus nigricollis 19. 75 ± 2. 15 and Sambar Rusa unicolor 11. 11 ± 1. 19 while the least was found for Langur <b>Semnopithecus</b> <b>entellus</b> 2. 47 ± 0. 21 and Bluebull Boselaphus tragocamelus 2. 47 ± 0. 21.

40|$|In a {{competitive}} sympatric association, coexisting species {{may try to}} reduce interspecific interactions as well as competition for similar resources by several ecological and behavioral practices. We studied resource utilization of three sympatric primate species namely, lion-tailed macaques (Macaca silenus), bonnet macaques (M. radiata) and Hanuman langurs (<b>Semnopithecus</b> <b>entellus)</b> in a tropical rainforest of the central Western Ghats, south India. We studied resource use, tree-height use, foraging height, substrate use when consuming animal prey and interspecific interactions. The results revealed that across the year, there was very limited niche overlap in diet between each species-pair. Each primate species largely depended on different plant species or different plant parts and phenophases from shared plant species. Primate species used different heights for foraging, and the two macaque species searched different substrates when foraging on animal prey. We also recorded season-wise resource abundance for the resources shared by these three primate species. While there was low dietary overlap {{during the dry season}} (a period of relatively low resource abundance), there was high dietary overlap between the two macaque species during the wet season (a period of high resource abundance for the shared resources). We observed only a few interspecific interactions. None of these were agonistic, even during the period of high niche overlap. This suggests that the sympatric primate species in this region are characterized by little or no contest competition. Unlike in some other regions of the Western Ghats, the lack of interspecific feeding competition appears to allow these primates, especially th...|$|R

It causes severe febrile illness in humans and was first recognized in 1957 {{associated with a}} high number of deaths among monkeys in Kyasanur Forest. Genetic analysis of 48 viruses isolated in India during 1957 – 2006 showed low diversity (1. 2 %). Bayesian coalescence analysis of these sequences and those of KFDVs from Saudi Arabia and the People’s Republic of China estimated that KFDVs have evolved at a mean rate of ≈ 6. 4 × 10 – 4 substitutions/site/year, which is similar to rates estimated for mosquito-borne flaviviruses. KFDVs were estimated to have shared a common ancestor in ≈ 1942, fifteen years before identification of the disease in India. These data are consistent with the view that KFD represented a newly emerged disease when first recognized. Recent common ancestry of KFDVs from India and Saudi Arabia, despite their large geographic separation, indicates long-range movement of virus, possibly by birds.

40|$|Successful {{locomotion}} depends {{not only}} on the appropriate patterns of segmental movements, but also on the input and reliable processing of sensory (visual, vestibular and somatosensory) information to coordinate these movements. Treadmill locomotion provides the foundation for much of what we do know about sensorimotor coordination of locomotion. Treadmills constrain whole–body displacements, simplifying the recording of physical and neurophysiological signals, and the control and manipulation of physiological and environmental variables. Visual, vestibular and proprioceptive inputs during treadmill and overground locomotion, however, are not identical. Thus, the degree to which sensory processing and motor strategies for balance and spatial orientation in unnatural treadmill locomotion are similar to natural overground locomotion is unknown. Nevertheless, this information is critical for determining how treadmill data can be used to infer locomotor control strategies that have evolved in the nervous system. This study addresses the issue by focusing on one aspect of locomotion: head and trunk movement patterns during quadrupedal walks and gallops. Previous studies of natural locomotion on the ground and flat surfaces by monkeys (Macaca radiata and <b>Semnopithecus</b> <b>entellus)</b> in the wild (Dunbar and Badam, 1998; Dunbar et al., 2004) and under semi-natural conditions (Macaca mulatta) (Dunbar and Badam, 1998) reveal that movement patterns of the head and trunk differ between gaits. During quadrupedal walks, which are characterized by a symmetrical footfall pattern, the trunk rotates through 10 ° or less in the pitch or sagittal plane. The head, however, is free to rotate in the pitch (> 20 °) and yaw or transverse (up to 180 °) planes during quadrupedal walks without any apparent disturbance to balance or spatial orientation. By contrast, the relative degree of segmental mobility reverses during quadrupedal gallops, a gait that incorporates an asymmetrical footfall pattern and an airborne phase. The trunk experiences large pitch rotations of up to 50 °. The head, however, experiences only small rotation...|$|R

Species frequently seen in the valley include lammergeier Gypaetus barbatus, Himalayan vulture Gyps himalayensis, yellow billed and red billed choughs Pyrrhocorax graculus and P. pyrrhocorax, koklass pheasant Pucrasia macrolopha, the nationally listed Himalayan monal pheasant Lophophorus impejanus, found in rhododendron thickets, scaly-bellied and yellow-nape woodpeckers Picus squamatus and P. flavinucha, great and bluethroated barbets Megalaima virens and M. asiatica, snow pigeon Columba leuconota and spotted dove Stigmatopelia chinensis. The area is relatively poor in reptiles: most often seen are the high altitude lizard Agama tuberculata, Himalayan ground skink Leiolopisma himalayana and Himalayan pit viper Gloydius himalayanus. Along with the flowers are wild bees and many species of butterfly which need to be more researched. A few of the more evident species are lime butterfly Papilio demoleus demoleus, common yellow swallowtail Papilio machaon, common Mormon Papilio polytes romulus, spangle Papilio protenor protenor and common blue apollo Parnassius hardwickei.|$|R
