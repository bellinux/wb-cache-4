This study investigated the effects of feeding four forage mixtures, namely grass silage (G); 67 g/ 100 g grass silage 133 g/ 100 g <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> (GGM); 67 g/ 100 g <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> 133 / 100 g grass <b>silage</b> (MMG); <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> (M) to four ruminally and duodenally canulated Holstein Friesian steers. All diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous (22. 4 g N/kg DM) using a concentrate mixture. Dietary dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) digestibility increased with ascending <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> inclusion (P, 0. 1) whereas starch and neutral detergent fibre digestibility declined (P, 0. 05). Ratio of non-glucogenic to glucogenic precursors in the rumen fluid increased with <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> inclusion (P, 0. 01) with a commensurate reduction in rumen pH (P, 0. 05).

This experiment investigated effects of four forage combinations being, grass silage (G); 67 g/ 100 g grass silage + 33 g/ 100 g <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> (GGM); 67 g/ 100 g <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> + 33 g/ 100 g grass <b>silage</b> (MMG); <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> (M). All diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous (22. 4 g N/kg dry matter [DM]) using a concentrate mixture. Ration digestibility and N balance was determined using 7 Holstein Friesian steers (mean body weight 411. 0 +/- 120. 9 kg) in a cross-over design. Inclusion of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> in the diet had a positive linear effect on forage and total DM intake (P = 0. 001), and on apparent DM and organic matter digestibility (both P = 0. 048). Regardless of the silage ratio used, the metabolisable energy concentration of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> was calculated {{to be higher than}} that of grass silage (P = 0. 058), and linearly related to the relative proportions of the two silages in the forage mixture. Inclusion of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> in the diet resulted in a linear decline in the apparent digestibility of starch (P = 0. 022), neutral detergent fibre (P < 0. 001) and acid detergent fibre (P = 0. 003).

40|$|<b>Maize</b> <b>silage</b> {{has become}} the major forage {{component}} in the ration of dairy cows {{over the last few}} decades. This review provides information on the mean content and variability in chemical composition, fatty acid (FA) profile and ensiling quality of <b>maize</b> <b>silages,</b> and discusses the major factors which cause these variations. In addition, the effect of the broad range in chemical composition of <b>maize</b> <b>silages</b> on the total tract digestibility of dietary nutrients, milk production and milk composition of dairy cows is quantified and discussed. Finally, the optimum inclusion level of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> in the ration of dairy cows for milk production and composition is reviewed. The data showed that the nutritive value of <b>maize</b> <b>silages</b> is highly variable and that most of this variation is caused by large differences in maturity at harvest. <b>Maize</b> <b>silages</b> ensiled at a very early stage (dry matter (DM) < 250 g kg(- 1)) were particularly low in starch content and starch/neutral detergent fibre (NDF) ratio, and resulted in a lower DM intake (DMI), milk yield and milk protein content. The DMI, milk yield and milk protein content increased with advancing maturity, reaching an optimum level for <b>maize</b> <b>silages</b> ensiled at DM contents of 300 - 350 g kg(- 1), and then declined slightly at further maturity beyond 350 g kg(- 1). The increases in milk (R(2) = 0. 599) and protein (R(2) = 0. 605) yields with maturity of <b>maize</b> <b>silages</b> were positively related to the increase in starch/NDF ratio of the <b>maize</b> <b>silages.</b> On average, the inclusion of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> in grass silage-based diets improved the forage DMI by 2 kg d(- 1), milk yield by 1. 9 kg d(- 1) and milk protein content by 1. 2 g kg(- 1). Further comparisons showed that, in terms of milk and milk constituent yields, the optimum grass/maize silage ratio depends on the quality of both the grass and <b>maize</b> <b>silages.</b> Replacement of grass <b>silage</b> with <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> in the ration, as well as an increasing maturity of the <b>maize</b> <b>silages,</b> altered the milk FA profile of the dairy cows, notably, the concentration of the cis-unsaturated FAs, C 18 : 3 n- 3 and n- 3 /n- 6 ratio decreased in milk fat. Despite variation in nutritive value, <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> is rich in metabolizable energy and supports higher DMI and milk yield.

All GMOs, along with irradiated food, are considered [...] "new food" [...] and subject to extensive, case-by-case, science based food evaluation by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The criteria for authorization fall in four broad categories: [...] "safety," [...] "freedom of choice," [...] "labelling," [...] and [...] "traceability." [...] The EFSA reports to the European Commission who then draft a proposal for granting or refusing the authorisation. This proposal is submitted to the Section on GM Food and Feed of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and if accepted it will be adopted by the EC or {{passed on to the}} Council of Agricultural Ministers. Once in the Council it has three months to reach a qualified majority for or against the proposal, if no majority is reached the proposal is passed back to the EC who will then adopt the proposal. However, even after authorization, individual EU member states can ban individual varieties under a 'safeguard clause' if there are [...] "justifiable reasons" [...] that the variety may cause harm to humans or the environment. The member state must then supply sufficient evidence that this is the case. [...] The Commission is obliged to investigate these cases and either overturn the original registrations or request the country to withdraw its temporary restriction. The laws of the EU also stipulated that member nations establish coexistence regulations.

The {{context in which}} the biogas plant manager needs to purchase the feedstock could be important when the biomass is also used in valorization trajectories besides anaerobic digestion. Using a combination of qualitative research and agent-based modelling, we investigated the effect of market context on the purchase of local biomass for anaerobic digestion.

40|$|In Belgium, growing <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> in a {{monoculture}} {{often results}} in increased soil compaction. The aim of our research was to quantify {{the effects of this}} soil compaction on the dry matter (DM) yields and the nitrogen use of <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> (Zea mays L.). On a sandy loam soil of the experimental site of Ghent University (Belgium), <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> was grown on plots with traditional soil tillage (T), on artificially compacted plots (C) and on subsoiled plots (S). The artificial compaction, induced by multiple wheel-to-wheet passages with a tractor, increased the soil penetration resistance up to more than 1. 5 MPa in the zone of 0 - 35 cm of soil depth. Subsoiling broke an existing plough pan (at 35 - 45 cm of soil depth). During the growing season, the release of soil mineral nitrogen by mineralisation was substantially lower on the C plots than on the T and S plots. <b>Silage</b> <b>maize</b> plants on the compacted soil were smaller and flowering was delayed. The induced soil compaction caused a DM yield loss of 2. 37 Mg ha(- 1) (- 13. 2 %) and decreased N uptake by 46. 2 kg ha(- 1) (- 23. 2 %) compared to the T plots. Maize plants on compacted soil had a lower, suboptimal nitrogen content. Compared with the traditional soil tillage that avoided heavy compaction, subsoiling offered no significant benefits for the <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> crop. It was concluded that avoiding heavy soil compaction in <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> is a major strategy for maintaining crop yields and for enhancing N use efficiency. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

The tested <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> showed the highest and most reliable average dry matter yield with 23 tons per hectare, with a very low variance. The Sorghum and millet varieties had dry matter yields of 3 to 5 tons per hectare below the <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> yield but with individual values fluctuating in a broad range within years and locations. With values far below 28 % the dry matter contents were not suitable for ensiling. The grass and clover grass mixtures are good, stable and established alternatives to maize for silage.

The study was carried out in a mechanically ventilated broiler house with eight identical rooms, each accommodating 2260 broilers; it compromised two production cycles (rounds) of 35 days. The broilers were raised on four bedding materials: white wood shavings, chopped wheat straw, ground rapeseed straw, and <b>silage</b> <b>maize.</b> PM 10, PM 2. 5, and ammonia concentrations and ventilation rates were measured. Production results and the incidence of footpad lesions were assessed. The results showed that compared with wood shavings, <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> had 19 % lower PM 2. 5 emission (p < 0. 05).

Sixty continental crossbred steers with a mean initial BW of 531 kg (SD 23. 8) were blocked (n = 12 blocks) according to BW and allocated from within block to 1 of 5 dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design: <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> harvested on September 13 (DM = 277 g/kg), <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> harvested on September 28 (DM = 315 g/kg), <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> harvested on October 9 (DM = 339 g/kg), <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> harvested on October 23 (DM = 333 g/kg), and ad libitum concentrates (ALC). Diets based on <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> were supplemented with 2. 57 kg of concentrate DM daily, and ALC diets were supplemented with 1. 27 kg of grass silage DM daily. Silage and total DMI were greater (P = 0. 004) with <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> harvested on September 28 than with any other treatment, which in turn did not differ. Advancing maize maturity at harvest did not affect BW or carcass gain, with the ALC diet exhibiting greater (P = 0. 036) rates of carcass gain {{than any of the}} maize silage-based treatments. Apparent in vivo digestibility, determined using the AIA indigestible marker technique, was not affected by harvest maturity, with no linear or quadratic trends being identified. Digestibility of DM from the ALC diet was greater (P < 0. 001) than with any of the <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> treatments. Starch digestibility did not differ across <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> maturities; however, a linear (P = 0. 009) decrease in NDF digestibility was observed. Methane emissions, (g/d) measured using the sulfur hexafluoride tracer technique, were not affected by <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> maturity. Methane emissions relative to DMI tended (P = 0. 05) to decline with advancing <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> maturity, with a similar decline observed when methane was expressed per kilogram of carcass gain. Advancing maize maturity did not result in significant linear or quadratic responses in methane output proportional to GE intake. The ALC diet resulted in less methane output than the <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> treatments irrespective of the unit of expression.

Factors evaluated over a 28 day period were total DMI, pasture DM/maize silage DM substitution rate, herbage selection in the pasture, milk yield, fat and protein concentration. Supplementing cows with <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> increased total DMI by 22 % and lowered pasture herbage DMI by 21 %; {{equivalent to a}} substitution rate of 0. 5 kg pasture DM /kg of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> DM. Selection of herbage in the pasture was not affected by supplementation, but cows on both treatments selectively grazed the white clover. Supplementing cows with <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> increased milk yield by 34 %, fat yield by 35 % and protein yield by 35 % (P< 0. 05), but did not affect milk fat and protein concentration. In a metabolism trial, 6 rumen fistulated cows in mid-lactation were fed similar diets in a crossover experiment but with white clover fed ad libitum. Digestibility, nitrogen balance, milk yield, fat and protein concentration were evaluated over a 7 day period. <b>Maize</b> <b>silage</b> DM and white clover DM digestion in the rumen were evaluated by DM disappearance rates from nylon bags over a 96 hr period. Measurments of rumen fluid volume, fluid mean retention time, fluid outflow, pH, ammonia and VFA concentration and the acetate/propionate ratio were estimated over a 24 hr period. Supplementing cows with <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> increased total DMI by 34 %, without affecting DM digestibility (DMD). However, OMD was reduced by 5 % and fibre digestion by 18 % (P< 0. 05). Supplementing cows with <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> {{did not affect the}} rate of digestion of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> DM or white clover DM in nylon bags, but white clover was digested at a faster rate than <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> (P< 0. 05). The increased DOMI by cows supplemented with <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> was highly correlated with a 24 % increase in milk yield (P< 0. 05; iI= 61) but had no effect on milk fat and protein concentration. At similar nitrogen intakes cows supplemented with <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> produced 2. 3 kg more milk (P< 0. 050 =' 66) but there was no effect on milk fat and protein concentration. Rumen fluid volume, mean retention time and fluid outflow rate were not significantly altered by the <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> supplement, although rumen pH and ammonia concentration were significantly lower (P< 0. 05). Total VFA concentration was not significantly different between the two diets, but acetate concentration was significantly lower (P< 0. 05), while propionate concentration was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) in supplemented cows. The reduction in acetate and the corresponding increase in propionate, lowered the acetate/propionate ratio. Butyrate concentration was not affected. It was concluded that for cows in mid-lactation fed on good quality white clover dominant pasture, <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> supplementation can increase milk yield, without affecting milk fat and protein concentration. The increase in milk yield was attributed to increased apparent energy intake as nitrogen intake did not change markedly. However further work is required to quantify whether increased nitrogen utilization occurred and whether the lower ammonia concentration in <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> supplemented cows were due to improved rumen microbial synthesis.

The gradual increase in yield potential of <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> resulting from plant breeding was expressed better and was exploited in a more efficient way when maize was grown in rotation than when grown in monoculture...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The use of {{legume crops}} in maize {{rotation}} systems may decrease {{the need for}} nitrogen (N) fertilization and increase total output. The effect of previous crops (wheat, barley, lentil, Hungarian vetch, and fallow) and different N fertilization rates (0, 120, 160, 200, and 240 kg of N ha– 1) on yield and N content of <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> (Zea mays L.) were evaluated under irrigated conditions in Diyarbakır, Turkey, during the 1999 - 2000, 2000 - 2001, and 2001 - 2002 growing seasons. Dry matter yield varied between 10, 068. 2 and 16, 480. 4 kg ha– 1. It was determined that Hungarian vetch was a suitable rotation crop, and that 200 kg of N ha– 1 was the best N fertilization rate for <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> production across years and N rates. Moreover, according to the previous crop × N fertilization rate interaction, the highest dry matter yield was obtained from 240 kg of N ha– 1 after barley. <b>Silage</b> <b>maize</b> following Hungarian vetch in rotation {{did not respond to}} the application of more than 120 kg of N ha– 1, in terms of dry matter and N yields, while in barley-maize and wheat-maize these 2 parameters increased in response to every level of N fertilization applied. Additionally, fallow-maize and wheat-maize did not respond to the application of more than 200 kg of N ha– 1. The legumes showed potential as previous crops that could replace fallow and cereals in <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> production by reducing the amount of N fertilizer used on <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> without significantly decreasing dry matter and N yield. Nonetheless, the cereals demonstrated high dry matter yields, base...|$|E

In Denmark <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> now occupies more than 4 % of the arable land, but {{little is known}} {{on the effect of}} continuous <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> on soil carbon dynamics under NW European cropping conditions. Soil total-C and natural 13 C abundance were determined every 2 – 3 years in four Danish arable soils (0 – 20 cm) continuously cropped to maize for 14 years under identical climatic conditions.

40|$|Aerobic {{spoilage}} of silages occurs {{frequently and}} is undesirable because it reduces both its nutritive and hygienic quality. Silage inoculants containing heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria, like Lactobacillus buchneri, {{have already been}} proven to improve aerobic stability by augmented production of acetic acid, which inhibits yeasts. In this study, the effect of L. buchneri on fermentation characteristics and aerobic stability of alfalfa-ryegrass silage, red clover <b>silage</b> and <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> was assessed using microsilos. Two dosages, 1 × 105 and 3 × 105 cfu g- 1 of fresh matter, were compared to untreated control silage. Inoculation with L. buchneri clearly altered the fermentation characteristics of alfalfa-ryegrass and red clover silage, resulting in a significantly higher aerobic stability at both dosages. The effects of L. buchneri inoculation on <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> were less clear, but nevertheless the aerobic stability of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> inoculated with 1 × 105 cfu g- 1 of fresh matter was significantly higher compared to the untreated silage...|$|R
40|$|In some of {{the studies}} {{outlined}} in Part 1 of this report, mixed forages containing grass silage and a high proportion (60 %) of <b>maize</b> <b>silages</b> varying in maturity and starch content were supplemented with concentrates at different levels to compare the response in milk production with a <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> based forage and with good quality grass silage as the sole forage. The most suitable type of energy ingredient in the concentrate, i. e. high starch or low starch, high fibre ingredients, as supplements to <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> based forages or grass silage was investigated.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine digestibility of dry matter(DM), organic matter (OM) and digestibility of organic matter in dry matter (D-value) of primary cut, different maturity stages grass silage in interaction with <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> (33 % and 67 %, DM based). Grass silage was harvested in three maturity stages of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) (late vegetative, internode elongation and flowering) that was a dominant grass in the sward. The study consisted of ten feeding treatments with 10 whether Charolais sheep in incomplete changeover design. Dry matter content of I, II and III cutting term was 396, 408 i 463 g kg- 1 of the fresh sample respectively, while crude protein (CP) content was 119. 6, 98. 0 i 93. 0 g kg- 1 in DM respectively. Dry mater and starch concentration in <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> was 264 g kg- 1 fresh sample and 211 g kg- 1 DM respectively. Inclusion of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> in the grass silage of the I cutting term (33 % vs. 67 %) did not influence digestibility of DM and OM or D-value. Inclusion of 67 % of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> in the II cuting term grass silage based diet increased DM digestibility (P< 0. 05). Inclusion of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> (33 % vs. 67 %) in the grass silage of the III cutting term increased DM digestibility (P< 0. 05) and D-value (P< 0. 05), while the inclusion of 67 % of <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> increased OM digestibility (P< 0. 05) in comparison with feeding treatment with grass silage III only.

40|$|<b>Silage</b> <b>maize</b> variety testing systems usually {{evaluate}} {{new varieties}} within properly defined maturity groups; within a maturity group, all varieties are harvested {{on a single}} harvest date. In a small country like Belgium where growing conditions are similar across the maize growing areas, all tested <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> varieties, comprising different maturity groups, are harvested on a single date. Under this testing system, only few varieties are harvested at the physiological stage where they theoretically show their optimal performance. In the current research, eight <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> varieties were monitored from 25 to 40 % whole-crop dry matter (DM) content at three locations in Belgium during the period 2007 - 2009. The optimal harvest date was calculated as the date where whole-crop DM yield, ear DM yield and organic matter digestibility were maximal. The variety rank at the optimal harvest date was compared with the variety rank at any studied single harvest date. Harvest dates where the variety rank was not statistically different to the rank at the optimal harvest date were pooled in a 'harvest window'. Based on the current data, the harvest window comprised a flexible harvest period of about 14 days. It was therefore concluded that applying a single harvest date is scientifically justified for the ranking of <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> varieties in Belgium, when the whole-crop DM content is between 28. 1 and 40. 6 % with a maximum difference of 7. 2 % between all compared varieties...|$|E
30|$|One {{possibility}} {{to counteract the}} negative impacts associated with the large-scale production of <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> would be {{the introduction of new}} bioenergy crops into the existing crop rotations and, beyond this, to create new ‘integrative concepts’ [11],[12].|$|E
40|$|The {{aboveground}} parts, grain yield, {{dry matter}} and water {{content of the}} <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> varieties Bermasil (early) and Mv MSC 485 (mid-season) and the grain maize varieties Mv To 286 (early) and NKPX 9283 (mid-season) were analysed to determine how these traits should be modified to develop a variety type more suitable {{for the production of}} bioenergy, more particularly biogas. It was established that <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> types are generally taller, with larger tassels, leaves, cobs and stalk mass below the ear, making them suitable for biogas production. It is important to note, however, that the grain yield of these varieties should not be ignored, as it makes up 40 – 50 % of the total aboveground dry matter yield. As one of the earliest maturing varieties, the <b>silage</b> <b>maize</b> variety Bermasil could be suitable in itself for biogas production. Based on the present and earlier data, it can be concluded that varieties with later maturity dates than those generally used for silage production could also be suitable for biogas production, provided they reliably reach the “half milk line” stage of maturity and a grain moisture content of around 42 % every year in the given environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the investigation was to determine ad libitum intake of fresh ration, dry matter (DM) and the organic matter (OM) of grass silage from the primary growth harvested at different maturity stages in interaction with <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> (33 % and 67 %, DM based) in g kg- 1 of the metabolic body weight (M 0. 75). Grass silage was harvested in three maturity stages of orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) that was dominant grass in the sward (late vegetative, internode elongation, flowering). The study consisted of ten feeding treatments with 10 whether Charolais sheep in incomplete changeover design. Dry matter content of I, II and III cutting term was 396, 408 i 463 g kg- 1 of the fresh sample, respectively, while crude protein (CP) content was 119. 6, 98. 0 and 93. 0 g kg- 1 of DM respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the performance of beef cattle in feedlots fed diets containing either whole-crop <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> or sugarcane silage, and with different formulations. Five diets were evaluated: MSF - diet containing whole-crop <b>maize</b> <b>silage,</b> with fixed formulation during feedlot period; MSV- diet containing whole-crop <b>maize</b> <b>silage,</b> with variable formulation according to feedlot phase; SCSF - diet containing sugarcane silage with fixed formulation; SCSV- diet containing sugarcane silage, with variable formulation; SCSV/MSV- SCSV diet in initial half of fedlot and MSV diet in final half of feedlot period, respectively. It was used a complete random experimental design, with five treatments and three replicates (pens). It was used 285 steers at 36 months of age, with an initial body weight of 362. 4 kg. Diets with whole-crop <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> promoted greater intake of dry matter (10. 5 kg and 2. 4 % BW) compared with diets containing sugarcane silage (10. 1 kg and 2. 3 % BW). There was no effect of the silages on average daily gain (1. 348 kg/animal/day) and live weight at slaughter (481. 2 kg BW). SCSV/MSV diet promoted the worst feed conversion (8. 0 kg DM/kg BW). Animals fed diets composed of whole-crop <b>maize</b> <b>silage</b> presented greater weight of hot carcass, of carcass yield and subcutaneous fat thickness (262. 1 kg, 54. 1 % and 6. 2 mm) compared with the animals fed sugarcane silage (252. 5 kg, 52. 7 % and 4. 8 mm). The use of sugarcane silage in diets for finishing beef cattle is feasible and the adjustment of formulation during confinement period does not influence performance of the animals.
