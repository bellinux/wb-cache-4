50|$|The jockey shifter is a gear {{shifting}} device used on motorcycles before {{the use of}} a foot-operated shift lever. A jockey shifter gets its name from the location of the motorcycle rider's hand when shifting gears. It is under his seat like the position of a jockey's hand while using his riding crop on his horse. This hand shifter lever is directly mounted to the transmission and is just long enough to clear the primary drive cover or belt drive. A motorcycle equipped with this type of shifter requires {{the use of a}} foot clutch. The foot clutch comes in one of two configurations; either a rocker foot clutch, which was stock on many early motorcycles, or a suicide foot clutch, which was never available on production motorcycles but was manufactured by daring motorcycle enthusiasts. The suicide foot clutch was usually a very simple lever, more or less a mirror image of the rear brake lever {{on the other side of}} the motorcycle; like a standard shift car's clutch lever. The rocker foot clutch is easier to use than the suicide foot clutch because it can be rocked into a position where the clutch is either engaged or disengaged - leaving the rider's foot free to be put down, at a stop, to steady the motorcycle. Sometimes a tank shifter is referred to as a jockey shifter, but this is incorrect due to the rider's hand position being in front of him, not behind him like for a horse jockey. A tank shifter is also connected to the transmission with linkage, which jockey shifters do not use. The earliest known use of a foot clutch and hand shifter, on motorcycles, was with the first multi-geared transmission on the 1915 Harley Davidson. It is a mechanical linkage that is typically mounted to the left side of the motorbike's fuel tank and is held in place by a <b>slotted</b> <b>piece</b> of metal welded to the frame or the tank. Through a series of linkages, it is connected to the transmission shift selection lever. In terms comparable to a motorcycle of current construction, it is simply a way to relocate the shift lever from the front foot controls to the side of the gas tank. Early motorcycle customizers who were trying to reduce their motorcycle's weight so as to increase its power-to-weight ratio would sometimes replace their stock rocker foot clutch with a hand fabricated suicide foot clutch, and remove the tank shifter's linkage and instead attach a shifter arm directly to the transmission (jockey shifter). This reduced weight not only made the bike accelerate better, but also gave the rider bragging rights of riding a motorcycle which required more skill to operate.|$|E

50|$|The basic track {{sections}} contained two <b>slots,</b> though single-slot <b>pieces</b> also existed. They permitted quite complex road layouts, and included a crossroads, a 4-section roundabout, forks to create dual carriageway sections, right-angle junctions, single-track forks to allow lay-bys, {{and later a}} crossover from the left to the right track (with {{a break in the}} conductors). Railway compatibility was ensured by a level crossing and road/rail interchange pieces. Curves could be built with up to 5 parallel slots.|$|R

In addition, Zmetal {{is often referred to as}} Zscreen were the screen comes from the optical definition. It is noteworthy that the thin sheet or screen does not have to be metal, but rather any material that supports a [...] (current density vector) leading to a magnetic potential [...] One issue with this equation, is that the screen must be relatively thin to the given wavelength (or range thereof). If it is not, modes can begin to form or fringing fields may no longer be negligible.|$|R

Precise measurement is not required, as the biscuits are hidden when the pieces are assembled, so a quick pencil stroke that marks both pieces where they align {{is all that is}} required.

50|$|In {{the design}} of the Lynch motor armature, the iron {{laminations}} are made from individual thin rectangular <b>pieces</b> <b>slotted</b> together to form a full circular ring. Because magnetic flux passes sideways through the laminations along one axis only, it is possible to use grain-oriented material normally used in large transformers. This has much better magnetic properties along the grain orientation but worse properties in other directions. In a traditional electric motor it gives little or no benefit, but in the Lynch motor leads to higher efficiencies.|$|R

5000|$|The {{players are}} {{equipped}} with three weapons: a primary weapon, a secondary weapon, and a melee weapon. All equipment can be upgraded with [...] "mods" [...] that drop from enemies or are given as mission rewards; these can be installed, removed and upgraded into <b>slots</b> on the <b>piece</b> of equipment. Companions can also be equipped and accompany Tenno on missions, each with their own powers. These can be floating mechanical sentries, called Sentinels, or, following a quest, players can earn their own Kubrow, a canine-esque monotreme with a horned nose, or a Kavat, a feline-esque animal with reptilian features. Warframes, equipment, companions as well as various other elements in the game can level up, which increases attributes and/or allowing more [...] "mods" [...] to be equipped.|$|R
5000|$|Combat in Fallen Earth is {{generally}} in a first-person shooter format. The camera {{can be moved}} to alternate between third and first person modes. Players will need to manually keep their targets in a targeting reticle to actually hit them in combat. Skills {{can be used to}} influence combat in different ways, but again, enemies must still be manually targeted. There is no [...] "target locking" [...] as in other MMOs. There are three main methods of dealing damage in the game. These are broken down by a weapon's effective range. Rifles, pistols, and melee are the primary weapon types. Rifles specialize in long distance damage, but are capable of using some short distance weaponry. Pistols are considered the most balanced of the weapon types, able to do damage at medium to short range. Melee, with its short range, is for close-quarters combat. [...] Fallen Earth has thousands of items as well as equipment and accessories of varying strength for players to craft and equip in up to 22 separate equipment <b>slots.</b> Each <b>piece</b> of equipment varies in weight, and possesses different qualities. Heavier equipment, for example, will generally offer higher defense bonuses, but also increases noise while moving - making stealth more difficult. Fallen Earth allows its players to carry as many as six active weapons which alter the character's appearance. The game also has a variety of vehicles. Players start out neutral in Fallen Earth and can remain neutral or choose to align themselves with a particular faction. Aligning with a faction will give characters a head start in skills and specialized equipment. The game supports PhysX and Vivox, Inc.'s in-game voice communication technology.|$|R
5000|$|Italian archaeologists {{unearthed}} {{the ruins}} of a 6th-century BC Greek structure in southern Italy that came with detailed assembly instructions and is being called an [...] "ancient IKEA building". The structure was a temple-like building discovered at Torre Satriano, near the southern city of Potenza, in Basilicata, a region where local people mingled with Greeks who settled along the southern coast known as Magna Graecia and in Sicily from the 8th century BC onwards. Professor Christopher Smith, director of the British School at Rome, said that the discovery was [...] "the clearest example yet found of mason's marks of the time. It looks as if someone was instructing others how to mass-produce components and put them together in this way". Much like the instruction booklets, various sections of the luxury building were inscribed with coded symbols showing how the <b>pieces</b> <b>slotted</b> together. The characteristics of these inscriptions indicate they date back to around the 6th century BC, which tallies with the architectural evidence suggested by the decoration. The building was built by Greek artisans coming from the Spartan colony of Taranto in Apulia.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the last}} tapes {{released}} for the Mego Corporation version of 2XL was [...] "Trilex", a complete board game designed to be played against 2XL. The tape came with a board which fitted over {{the front of the}} 2XL unit itself, with the board in front of the tape slot. The game board consisted of an inverted pyramid shape, 4 squares wide at the top to 1 square at the bottom, with each row colored in a different color (Blue, Yellow, Green, and Tan), and 4 <b>slots</b> through which <b>pieces</b> (which 2XL called [...] "checkers") could be dropped into the pyramid. The slots aligned with 2XL's 4 buttons, with the intention that dropping the checker would also press the appropriate track button on 2XL. The objective of the game was to create either a line or a triangle of three checkers of a selected color. The game and tape design are interesting because they enabled the 4-track tape player to provide a passable simulation of a game-playing AI.|$|R
40|$|Gesture. Our {{approach}} to pen-based gesture recognition is to decompose pen strokes into sequences of basic shapes such as line, arc, arrow, circle, cross [...] . [5] The same gesture shape may mean different things {{depending on the}} surrounding context, hence each gesture component is augmented by gesture contexts indicating spatial relationships between the gesture and nearby objects in the user interface. Handwriting. Our MS-TDNN-based handwriting recognizer [6] is capable of processing writer-independent, continuous (cursive) handwriting at a recognition rate of 94 % on a 20, 000 -word vocabulary and working on the run-on mode. We employ simple heuristics to decide when to invoke handwriting recognition on pen input, e. g., when the gesture recognizer cannot identify the input strokes as basic shapes. 5. 2. Joint Interpretation In order {{to make sense of}} input from all available sources, we need a multimodal interpreter capable of producing an interpretation of user intent (e. g., a command to execute in the application interface) from the output of the modality processors. In our joint interpretation scheme, the user intent is represented by a frame consisting of <b>slots</b> specifying <b>pieces</b> of information such as the action to carry out or the parameters for that action. Recognition output from the modality processors are parsed into partially filled frames that are merged together to produce the combined interpretation as described in [5]. This technique leads to uniform handling of highlevel information from all input sources, which is very important for modularity and extensibility. To add another input modality we need only provide a module to convert low-level recognizer output to a partially filled frame to be merged with others. In addition, context information can be retained across input events by merging with previous interpretation frames. 6.

50|$|Atypically to most RPGs, the player's Hunter {{does not}} have any {{intrinsic}} attributes that change throughout the game, outside of a Hunting rank that determines what quests they can embark on. Instead, the player selects armor, weapons, and other equipment that grant certain bonuses or penalties to the Hunter. There are several different weapon types ranging from swords, hammers, hunting horns, lances, bows, and guns, each of which provide the player with different combat maneuvers in the field, and determine the Hunter's attack strength and potential elemental or status-inducing effects on the creatures they fight. Armor, made up from different pieces, grants defensive value, strengths and weaknesses to certain elemental attacks, and positive and negative points towards specific skills. These skills only activate after the player equips the Hunter with gear that pass a given threshold; for example, by having 10 total points in the Attack skill, the Hunter's attack is boosted, but may also accumulate -10 points in this skill which can weaken the Hunter's attack. Thus, the player can work to coordinate different sets of armor, weapon, and additional equipment including talismans and decorative gems that can be <b>slotted</b> into certain <b>pieces</b> of equipment to customize which skills their Hunter will have or to avoid inducing a negative skill effect.|$|R
5000|$|Gallagher commented: [...] "I {{wanted to}} write a police drama that I would like to watch. One that would thrill me and disturb me. One that would shake me up and be about {{subjects}} that really matter, not just the stories, but the way that the stories are told. I tried to take the characters to places that they wouldn't want to go, were scared to go and to see what happened. I wanted to try and take a daring and confrontational approach. This wasn't me and Marc (Munden, the director) indulging some arty idea but looking for ways to crank up the tension, to delight in the storytelling and keep the thing moving at a real pace. Sometimes we have to hang on for two or three scenes until it adds up, 'till the <b>pieces</b> <b>slot</b> together. But when we get there, it's more fulfilling than having it handed to us on a plate. This series isn't based on any particular crime or case, but on what I feel is in the air, how we react when awful crimes happen. We live in angry times and I wanted to build Conviction around how people feel, how they react, how they relate and why." ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Though sliding {{techniques}} are quite common in orthodontics, the produced friction however hampers ideal movement of teeth. Increased friction not only necessitates a greater orthodontic force but also results in anchorage loss. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate frictional changes of steel brackets on stainless steel wires while sliding. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study a total of 69 stainless steel brackets (Dentaurum) with 0. 018 inch slots were randomly divided into three groups of 23 brackets. With each group either 0. 016 or 0. 016 × 0. 016 or 0. 016 × 0. 022 inch steel wires of the same company (Dentaurum) were used in combination with brackets. There were 5 <b>slots</b> on each <b>piece</b> and every <b>slot</b> was 1 mm apart from the next. Therefore each piece of wire was pulled via Dartec machine in every bracket slot with an average speed of 0. 5 mm/min in five sections. The amounts of friction were recorded. The collected data were then compared with repeated measurement ANOVA and paired sample T-test. (α = 0. 05) Three brackets were randomly examined under scanning electron microscope (SEM) at the beginning and after the first, the third and the fifth tractions. Results: Repeated measurement ANOVA showed statistical significant differences in static and kinetic frictions between first to fifth tractions in three sizes of wires. Based on paired sample t-test, significant differences were seen between first traction and the others. However, differences between the third and the forth, the third and the fifth and the forth and the fifth tractions were not significant between the three sizes of wires and the two kinds of frictions. Conclusion: It seems that friction would decrease during sliding of steel brackets on steel wires. Diameter and cross section of wires would have little effect on friction.
