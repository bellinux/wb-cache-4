Municipalities were divided into villages, which consisted of individual properties. Borders between properties and thus municipalities were defined by oral agreements passed down from generation to generation; usually along straight lines between defined markers such as boulders. Medieval documentation survives only from legal disputes concerning borders. Furthermore, the secular government divided the properties to <b>taxable</b> <b>units</b> (villages and secular municipalities) according to its own convenience; thus, they not necessarily convergent with parishes. Furthermore, cities were chartered separately. Up to 1734, the law was different in cities than in rural municipalities.|$|R
40|$|My thesis {{examined}} {{an alternative}} approach, {{referred to as}} the unitary taxation approach to the allocation of profit, which arises from the notion that as a multinational group exists as a single economic entity, it should be taxed as one <b>taxable</b> <b>unit.</b> The plausibility of a unitary taxation regime achieving international acceptance and agreement is highly contestable due to its implementation issues, and economic and political feasibility. Using a case-study approach focusing on Freeport-McMoRan and Rio Tinto's mining operations in Indonesia, this thesis compares both tax regimes against the criteria for a good tax system - equity, efficiency, neutrality and simplicity. This thesis evaluates key issues that arise when implementing a unitary taxation approach with formulary apportionment based on the context of mining multinational firms in Indonesia...|$|R
40|$|Corporate {{groups are}} {{notoriously}} difficult to tax. At {{the moment it}} is not clear whether corporate groups should be approached as <b>single</b> <b>taxable</b> entities, or whether a separate tax existence should be attributed to corporate group members. The current ambiguity generates a substantial deadweight loss. This study determines what may be the best approach to tax corporate groups, once the perspectives of government and corporate groups are taken into account. The study adopts an interdisciplinary approach, whereby elements, such as market imperfections, the economic, legal and functional nature of corporate groups and the rules of related regulatory fields, are brought into the investigation. The study is based on the US federal corporate income tax system, although, for certain issues, the UK tax system is analyzed. The study adopts a closed economy perspective. The study shows that the design and operation of the corporate income tax system is subject to several constraints and distortions, and argues that to simply look at how far a certain policy is from optimality may be insufficient to determine whether an incremental improvement occurs. The study proposes a new approach to corporate income tax policy whereby the pursuit of incremental improvements requires the minimization of transaction costs and other sources of deadweight loss and the taking into account of the collateral effects of the corporate income tax system, including its interaction with market imperfections, the behavioural and operational nature of business entities, the frictions imposed by other regulatory fields and corporate governance. Following this policy approach, the study concludes that treating corporate groups as <b>single</b> <b>taxable</b> entities is the best approach to tax corporate groups and recommends a revision of certain technical aspects of the current US and UK legislation for taxation of corporate groups...|$|R

The proposal geographically assigns the tax base in international situations to the countries where the multinational effectively sells its products and services instead of, as is currently the case, to the countries in which its investments are located.

This article deals with specific tax avoidance and fiscal competition aspects of VAT grouping schemes in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. The article gives examples of tax abuse and avoidance by using various VAT grouping models, with the main emphasis on the practice in Denmark, which may be indicative of similar problems in other countries. The article shows that there are {{significant differences in the}} rationales for national VAT grouping schemes, and these indicate that there are mismatches between the national schemes of the EU Member States and the original intention of the EU scheme. Finally, an examination of the different national rationales shows the necessity of striking a balance between combating tax avoidance and preventing distortion of competition...|$|R

40|$|Tax {{optimization}} {{is a legal}} {{technique to}} decrease tax liability without breaking the law. The Czech legislation enables several ways to legally reduce revenues and therefore the individual as well as corporate income tax. For that reason, taking advantage of this option is a logical conduct of every <b>taxable</b> <b>unit.</b> This B. A. thesis aims to analyze the tax burden of a five-employee company and propose the best solution of tax minimization of the particular company. Eight possibilities of tax optimization are mentioned in this thesis, namely superannuation scheme allowence, personal life insurance allowance, food allowance (meal tickets), long-term property renewal provision, utilising the tax allowance in connection with reduced working capacity employees, acquiring immaterial tangible assets, acquiring long-term tangible assets and tax relief when providing donations. The aforementioned options indicate the best ways of minimizing the tax burden. However, not every company in the Czech Republic {{can take advantage of}} all the options, since individual entrepreneurial subjects are specific in their own way, making the particular company choose the most appropriate way of tax optimization...|$|R

5000|$|In Welch v. De Blois, 1 Cir., 1938, 94 F.2d 842, {{this court}} allowed a cash method {{taxpayer}} {{to make a}} full deduction of insurance premiums in the year he paid them as an ordinary and necessary business expense, {{despite the fact that}} the insurance covered a three-year period. However, this court is unable to find a basis for distinguishing the prepayment of rentals, bonuses for the acquisition of leases, bonuses for the cancellation of leases, commissions for negotiating leases - all of which need to be prorated over the time period - and prepaid insurance. This court can cite no justification for treating prepaid insurance in a different manner than treating other prepayments. To permit the taxpayer to take a full deduction in the year of payment would distort his income. Moreover, prepaid insurance may be easily allocable. The insurance premium represents the protection of the property for the entire period, and the taxpayer may surrender the insurance policy at any time. Therefore, the insurance is clearly an asset having a longer life than a <b>single</b> <b>taxable</b> year. [...] Furthermore, by treating prepaid insurance as a capital expense, we are obtaining some degree of consistency. We therefore overrule Welch v. De Blois and hold that prepaid insurance deductions must be allocable over the time period for which the policy covers.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to groups as value added tax payers. This concept was {{introduced}} into Czech law on 1 st January 2008. A VAT group enables persons that meet the criteria required by the VAT Act {{to be considered a}} <b>single</b> <b>taxable</b> person, i. e. a single tax payer. The Czech VAT group legislation is based on article 11 of Council Directive 2006 / 112 /EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax. The aim of this thesis is to present and thoroughly analyze VAT group legislation in Czech law, and to point out certain pitfalls of this legislation, including its interaction with EU law, and the law of some of the other EU member states. A secondary goal is to assess the rate at which VAT groups are being used in the Czech Republic. The first chapter describes VAT group in EU law, and its introduction into the Czech legal order. The second chapter discusses the requirements that the law puts on members of a VAT group, with extra emphasis on the requirement of close binding of persons, including the membership of physical persons and non-taxable persons in a VAT group. The third chapter deals with VAT group as a subject of legal relations, describing in more detail the concept of a representative member and the responsibilities of a VAT group member.

50|$|Section 101 {{creates a}} {{refundable}} {{income tax credit}} of a maximum of the lesser of either the aggregate amount of money paid in premiums in a <b>single</b> <b>taxable</b> year or {{the sum of the}} monthly limitations for months that the taxpayer or the taxpayer's qualifying members are considered eligible. The monthly limitation is one-twelfth of the sum of $2,000 ($4,000 if filing a joint tax return) and $500 per dependent. A maximum of two dependents can be claimed and the credit adjusts to inflation annually. The tax credit can only be claimed if the taxpayer and the taxpayer's spouse and dependents have purchased a qualified health insurance plan. The credit can be claimed in full by taxpayers at or below 200% of the federal poverty level (FPL). Above 200% of the FPL, the percentage of the credit that can be claimed decreases by 1 percentage point for each $1,000 earned over 200% of the FPL. Section 102 directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to create a payment system to allow for the credit to be paid directly to the insurance provider to cover premium expenses in advance. Under Section 103, individuals who are otherwise eligible for Medicare, Medicaid, a state child health insurance program (SCHIP), TRICARE, veterans' benefits, federal employee health benefits (FEHBP), or a group health plan subsidized by the employer may choose to claim the aforementioned tax credit instead of receiving any benefits under such program.|$|R
40|$|Cities in the {{developing}} countries face constant problems with urban management. International financing and development agencies, like World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and UN-Habitat, have devised several programmes and initiatives to solve this problem. So far only limited success has been recorded. The need to raise sufficient financing for city administrations to function effectively is perhaps the main objective of city governance. Plans, objectives, decisions, statements etc. are all irrelevant {{if there is not}} the capability to carry them through. This capability requires a sustainable form of income. In this paper new approaches and methods are sought for the urban problem solving. The first priority is to enable the Local Government Unit (LGU) to generate its own permanent revenue base. Only with steady and predictable annual revenue is it possible to plan actions for sustainable development. Property taxation seems to be the easiest direct revenue source for {{the developing}} cities. There are hardly any possibilities, e. g., to use income taxation. What is needed is a system that allows city managers to identify all <b>taxable</b> <b>units</b> and determine the tax payable. This information needs to be linked to Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and an accounting system that will produce bills, monitor receipts and notify the need for action on arrears. This approach is called Systematic Land Information Management (SLIM). Two pilot areas have been identified (Gaza City in Palestine and Kanpur City in Uttar Pradesh State in India) where the first attempts similar to this new approach have been made. The results have been quite encouraging. One later example is briefly introduced. SLIM in the Philippines is a new project where thi...|$|R

40|$|In September 2014 the ECJ {{issued its}} {{decision}} in C- 7 / 13 the Skandia case. The case con- cerned service transactions made between a main establishment {{in a third}} country and its Swedish branch. The branch {{was a member of}} a VAT group in Sweden. The ECJ estab- lished that the membership resulted in that the VAT group was considered as one taxable person which meant that the services was considered provided to the group itself and not the separate member. Therefore the transactions were deemed taxable. The purpose of this thesis is to analyse the ECJ’s assessment and judgment of the Skandia case, and how the decision affect art. 11 of the VAT Directive about VAT groups. The art. 11 of the VAT Directive provides a possibility for Member States of the EU to in- troduce rules that makes it possible for more than one person, if they meet certain criteria, to qualify as a <b>single</b> <b>taxable</b> person. In Sweden, these rules are implemented in chapter 6 a of the Swedish VAT Law. The rules on VAT groups have been further developed and in- terpreted by case law from the ECJ. The thesis shows that the Skandia case confirms some of the principles from previous case law, and develops new principles for the application of art. 11 of the VAT Directive. We draw the conclusion that the development of the law in relation to the ECJ's decision in the Skandia case, indicates that art. 11 of the VAT Directive should be assessed independently and not be influenced by other articles of the VAT Directive. We also believe that the Skandia case suggest that the territorial limitation of art. 11 means that a person must be physically established in a Member State to be able to be a member of a VAT group in that Member State. Finally, we draw the conclusion that the Skandia case indicates that the ECJ has taken inspiration from the international co-operation organ OECD. Such development is interesting because a correlation between these two organs would lead to a greater pre- dictability and legal certainty on an international level. ...|$|R
40|$|Multinational groups (MNGs) {{produce a}} major part of global output. Further, a {{substantial}} fraction of international transactions happens to be internal, i. e., intermediate products and services are traded between group members. Thus, the problem of co-ordinating economic decisions like investment or production within such large entities has been widely recog-nized in the theoretical and empirical literature. The findings suggest that transfer prices are a widespread device for splitting up complex decision situations and allocating the responsibility for the resulting subproblems to several decision makers. Apart from its co-ordination function transfer pricing is also used for tax purposes. Legally independent group members realize intra-group sales and contribute to a <b>single</b> product. <b>Taxable</b> group profits are often allocated among the participating companies by means of transfer prices. In this case, from the group's perspective, transfer pricing is a device of international tax planning. Of course, national tax authorities have been aware of potential misuse. In Europe, the problem has become especially severe since the mid-European countries joined the EU. Due to the emerging large tax rate differentials, tax revenues of high-tax legislations eroded. For mitigating this problem formula apportionment (FA) is discussed intensively. Under FA, a common tax base is calculated and divided among the host countries in accordance with given apportionment factors. As a consequence, earnings management fails to re-allocate profits to low-tax legislations and tax base erosion seems to be stopped. However, FA could even be more harmful than transfer pricing because under FA income shifting would require changing economic decisions instead of just taking advantage of accounting options. In addition to the erosion of tax revenues, capital investments and employment could decrease in high-tax legislations. The goal of our paper is to analyze the impact of different international tax allocation regimes on the MNG's investment and production decisions. In our theoretical model, we derive optimal decisions under transfer pricing and FA. A prominent result of our analysis is that FA offsets the advantages of decision decentralization as it reverses the separation of responsibility areas. It is not clear whether FA is desirable from a fiscal or an entrepreneurial perspective. We show that the effects of FA compared to transfer pricing depend strongly on the parameter setting under consideration. One of the most important determinants is the internal decision procedure within the MNG.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} effects of India''s tax system on growth, through the level and {{productivity}} of private investment. Comparison of India''s indicators of effective tax rates and tax revenue productivity with other countries shows that the Indian tax system is characterized by: (1) a high dependence on indirect taxes, (2) low average effective tax rates and tax productivity, and (3) high marginal effective tax rates and large tax-induced distortions on investment and financing decisions. The paper finds that the most recently proposed package of reforms would improve tax productivity and lower the marginal tax burden and tax-induced distortions. But firms that rely on internal sources of funds or face problems borrowing would continue to face high marginal tax rates.
