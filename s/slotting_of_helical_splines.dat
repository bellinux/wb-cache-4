50|$|The Volkswagen {{variator}} {{is referred}} to as a 'fluted variator', owing to the shape of the hydraulic components. Unlike the Alfa Romeo system with its <b>helical</b> <b>splines</b> and indirect actuation, the Volkswagen system has a direct rotational action. The internal components of the variator resemble a paddle wheel inside a loose casing, so that it is free to move a few degrees from side to side. By applying hydraulic pressure on one side of these paddles, a phase shift is achieved. The hydraulic fluid is engine oil, controlled by a solenoid valve mounted on the cylinder head and controlled by the ECU. A Hall effect sensor also monitors the camshaft position.|$|R

The reaserch studied about the effect <b>of</b> spacing <b>of</b> <b>helical</b> plates to uplift capacity <b>of</b> <b>helical</b> pile and compared to wood pile and helical without pile.

The numerical modelling of actual pullout response is achieved by axisymmetric and horizontal loading condition. The effect of varying number <b>of</b> <b>helical</b> plates, helical plate spacing and helical plate diameter is studied to understand the pullout capacity behaviour. The failure surfaces for various helical soil nail configurations and their pullout mechanisms are also analysed and discussed. The pullout capacity is found to increase with increase in number <b>of</b> <b>helical</b> plates. The helical plate spacing ratio (s/Dh) and diameter ratio (Dh/Ds) are found to increase the pullout only up to a critical value. The response <b>of</b> <b>helical</b> soil nail using axisymmetric finite element simulation is found similar to the uplift behaviour <b>of</b> <b>helical</b> piles and helical soil anchors.

30|$|The present work {{deals with}} helical piles that {{extensively}} used in foundations for structures subjected to both compressive and tensile forces. The behavior <b>of</b> square <b>helical</b> piles models (5  ×  5) mm, embedded in expansive soil overlaying {{a layer of}} well compacted sandy soil, (single and group <b>of</b> <b>helical</b> piles) were investigated and compared with ordinary piles. Model tests are performed with helical pile length 150, 200, and 300  mm and helix diameters 15 and 20  mm. Helical piles with one helix and double helix were considered. The pattern <b>of</b> <b>helical</b> piles group models consists of four piles in a square arrangement. Thirty-six models <b>of</b> <b>helical</b> pile groups embedded into the expansive soil were performed. It is found that the pile length, number of helix, and helix diameter have a great effect on the amount and rate of uplift movement <b>of</b> <b>helical</b> piles embedded in expansive soil. The deeper helical piles with higher L/D ratios showed greater pullout capacity comparing to the shallower piles.

40|$|AbstractHelical vortices, as {{one kind}} of {{secondary}} flows, are recently observed downstream of the short twisted tape. The behaviors of vortices, which have significant effects on the efficiency of twisted tape, are not well understood. As such, the formation and development <b>of</b> <b>helical</b> vortices induced by the short twisted tape are studied numerically. The results show that two symmetrical stable helical vortices are present downstream of the twisted tape. The values of radial velocities cannot be neglected due {{to the presence of}} the vortices. The vortices form in the twisted tape and remain the structure downstream of the twisted tape. Torsion promotes the formation <b>of</b> <b>helical</b> vortices.

50|$|Where a steam barring {{engine was}} used, {{this was a}} small {{twin-cylinder}} engine (to avoid its own dead centre problems) with a reduction gear of high ratio, usually involving a worm gear. Final drive was by a pinion gear engaging temporarily with the teeth or barring holes cut into {{the rim of the}} main flywheel. The drive pinion was arranged on a swinging link so that it was thrown out-of-mesh automatically, once the main engine started to rotate at full speed. As the ratio was perhaps 1000:1 and the main engine ran at 60 rpm, this would otherwise have been a disastrous overspeed. Some engines instead used a final pinion on a <b>helical</b> <b>spline,</b> similar to that later used for the starters of internal combustion engines: once the main engine started, the pinion would be thrown out of engagement axially along this spline as the flywheel over-speeded the pinion relative to the shaft.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The helix is {{a complex}} {{geometrical}} element. During the process of a dynamical measurement <b>of</b> the <b>helical</b> deviations, many factors, including the machine and the environment, lead to measurement errors. Although ISO as well as national standards stipulate the tolerances and assessment methods for helical deviations, these standards contribute little to the uncertainty calculations concerning such measurements. According to the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM), all measurement results must have a stated uncertainty associated to them. But in most cases <b>of</b> <b>helical</b> deviation measurements, no uncertainty value is given, simply because no measurement uncertainty calculation procedure exists. For the case <b>of</b> <b>helical</b> deviation measurements on a Computer Numeric Control (CNC) polar coordinate machine, this paper analyses in detail all kinds of factors contributing to the measurement uncertainty, and gives the calculation procedure of the measurement uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>helical</b> deviation. As an example, the calculation of the measurement uncertainty <b>of</b> the <b>helical</b> deviations <b>of</b> a worm is presented...|$|R
