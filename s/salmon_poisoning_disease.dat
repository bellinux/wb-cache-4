These fish and amphibians are infected with the larvae of a fluke, Nanophyetus salmincola through an intermediate host, the snail Oxytrema plicifer.

[...] In 1911, small white cysts were observed in the kidneys of disease-causing salmon and trout, but the cysts were mistakenly identified as amebae. [...] Small trematodes in the intestines of dogs that died after eating infected salmon were finally found in 1925 and the cysts present in the salmon were correctly identified as intermediate stages of the trematode. [...] In an experimental follow-up study, researchers showed that the small intestinal parasite did in fact cause SPD in dogs, and that the cysts did develop into the adult worm found in the intestine.|$|E

40|$|<b>Salmon</b> <b>poisoning</b> <b>disease</b> in dogs has {{previously}} been reported in North America only along the western coast of the U. S. A. This paper presents the findings from eight affected dogs recently diagnosed on Vancouver Island, Canada. The clinical signs shown by these dogs were lethargy, anorexia, pyrexia and lymph node enlargement. The causative agent, Neorickettsia helminthoeca was observed in macrophages obtained from lymph node aspirates. This organism is transmitted to dogs in cysts of the fluke Nanophyetus salmincola salmincola within the tissues of the salmon or trout. The presence of fluke eggs in the feces of dogs showing typical signs is very suggestive of a diagnosis of <b>salmon</b> <b>poisoning</b> <b>disease.</b> Appropriate treatment, including chloramphenicol or oxytetracycline and fluid therapy, resulted in recovery. Prevention of <b>salmon</b> <b>poisoning</b> <b>disease</b> in endemic areas {{can be achieved by}} advising owners against allowing their dogs to eat raw salmon or trout.

40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The {{etiologic}} agent of <b>salmon</b> <b>poisoning</b> <b>disease</b> {{was found to}} be Neorickettsia helminthoeca, although a second organism, the Elokomin fluke fever agent, may also be involved in other areas. Primary cultures of dog leucocytes were found to support the in vitro cultivation of Neorickettsia helminthoeca as were canine sarcoma 503 cells and mouse lymphoblasts MB III. Quantitative methods were not applied to in vitro studies of multiplication of the rickettsia because it failed to grow sufficiently in laboratory animals or in chicken embryo yolk sacs to do so. By ultrastructural analysis it was learned that Neorickettsia helminthoeca was structurally similar to other rickettsiae. Rickettsial cells were seen as circular profiles or rod-shaped cells 0. 5 μ wide and up to 0. 7 μ. long. They were bounded by a cell wall and an underlying cytoplasmic membrane. Each of the membranes was a trilayered structure and showed the unit membrane structure. Koch's postulates were fulfilled as completely as possible for an organism that is an obligate intracellular parasite. Neorickettsia helminthoeca was found in all cases of <b>salmon</b> <b>poisoning</b> <b>disease.</b> The rickettsia was isolated and grown in culture. The isolated culture was found to reproduce the disease when inoculated into susceptible dogs. The rickettsia was observed in and recovered from the inoculated dog.

40|$|Experimental {{evidence}} is presented supporting {{the development of}} a system for the isolation and propagation of a Neorickettsia sp. in a continuous canine macrophage cell line (DH 82). To isolate a Neorickettsia sp. pathogenic to the canine species, three naive dogs were fed metacercaria-encysted kidneys of salmon caught in a river where infection of metacercariae with Neorickettsia helminthoeca has been circumstantially known for decades. Clinically, the classic course of <b>salmon</b> <b>poisoning</b> <b>disease</b> developed in all of the dogs. Parasitemia began on day 8 to 11 postinfection, when the dogs developed a febrile peak, and continued until euthanasia. At necropsy, characteristic gross and microscopic lesions of the disease were present. A Neorickettsia sp. was also isolated from liver and spleen samples of these animals. The isolates have been continuously propagated and passed in DH 82 cells for more than 6 months. Electron microscopic examination confirmed that the rickettsial organisms multiplied in the membrane-bound compartment of DH 82 cells and that they morphologically closely resembled rickettsia belonging to the genus Ehrlichia. An indirect fluorescent antibody test using Neorickettsia organisms cultured in DH 82 cells showed that all dogs seroconverted 13 to 15 days postinfection. Finally, inoculation of the cell-cultured Neorickettsia organisms into a naive dog reproduced clinically typical <b>salmon</b> <b>poisoning</b> <b>disease</b> which was of greater severity and had a more rapid time course than that in the dogs from which the original isolation was made. On the basis of the clinical and pathologic responses of the dogs in our study, we believe that virulent N. helminthoeca was isolated and cultured in a continuous cell line...|$|E
40|$|<b>Salmon</b> <b>poisoning</b> <b>disease</b> (SPD) {{was tested}} as a {{potential}} method of lethal control for coyotes (Canis latrans). Fresh fish containing the agents for SPD was fed to 72 captive adult coyotes. Coho (Oncorhunchus kisutch) and steel head salmon (Salmo gairdneri) from Oregon hatcheries were the principal species of fish used. Coyotes that ate the fish developed observable signs of SPD in a mean of 8 days. The overall rate of mortality was 50 %, and death occurred in a mean of 20 days from consuming fish. Coyotes that died from SPD lost a mean of 32 % of their body weight {{during the course of}} the disease. Other coyotes were fed preserved fish samples or administered oral or intraperitoneal treatments of lymph node matter from coyotes that died from SPD. In light of the relatively low rate of mortality observed, feeding coyotes fish to cause death from SPD appears to be a method of questionable value for controlling numbers of adult coyotes in areas of livestock production unless fish with a highly virulent strain of the SPD agent can be obtained...|$|E
