50|$|While Elmore laments that sites {{could have}} been chosen with {{a greater degree of}} {{scientific}} rigor (e.g. <b>stratified</b> <b>random</b> <b>sampling),</b> this was impossible, for at least two reasons. First, Follow Through administrators had the obligation to select a minimum number of sites with Head Start programs, because the ostensible purpose of Follow Through was to complement Head Start. Second—aside from political pressures—communities had to be willing participants in the process (ostensibly) to preserving the fidelity of the implementations. On this point, Elmore tends to agree.|$|E

40|$|The Sierra report {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} {{for states to}} use to demonstrate that their Inspection and Maintenance (I/M) programs are obtaining emissions reductions similar to those estimated by the MOBILE emissions factor model. The proposed methodology involves comparing fleetwide test average emissions of a state I/M program with those of a benchmark program (Sierra suggests using the Arizona IM 240 program for the benchmark program). The fleet emissions are determined based on the final (passing) IM 240 test results of a <b>stratified</b> <b>random</b> <b>sample</b> of 1, 600 vehicles. Average fleet emissions are determined based on the age distribution of the fleet (Sierra suggests using three age groups, pre- 1975, 1975 - 1980, and post- 1980). The fleet emissions are then compared with the fleet emissions of the benchmark program, reweighted using the evaluated program’s vehicle age distribution. Programs that use an alternative I/M test (e. g. ASM, idle, etc.) and that cannot test a <b>random</b> <b>sample</b> of IM 240 s, must first determine the correlation between their test and the IM 240, based on a <b>stratified</b> <b>random</b> <b>sample</b> of 700 to 800 vehicles measured on both tests (depending {{on the type of}} alternative test used). Then fleet emissions are determined based on the final (passing) IM 240 test results of a <b>stratified</b> <b>random</b> <b>sample</b> of 3, 700 to 8, 000 vehicles (again, depending o...|$|R

5000|$|Archaeological field surveys {{can also}} be {{characterized}} as either purposive or sampling surveys. [...] The former, sometimes also called [...] "archaeological prospection," [...] involves cases where archaeologists are searching for a particular site or {{a particular kind of}} archaeological material. For example, they might be searching for a particular shipwreck or an historic fort whose exact location is no longer certain. However, they may also be searching for archaeological materials in particular locations to test hypotheses about past use of those spaces.Sampling surveys, on the other hand, have the goal of obtaining a representative sample of some population of sites or artifacts in order to make generalizations about that population. This involves some probability sampling of spatial units, such as random or <b>stratified</b> <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> of geometrical (often square) or irregular spatial units.|$|E
5000|$|Homogeneity {{tests for}} CRMs follow planned {{experimental}} designs. Because the experiment {{is intended to}} test for (or estimate the size of) variation in value between different CRM units, the designs are chosen to allow separation of variation in results due to random measurement error and variation due to differences between units of the CRM. Among the simplest designs recommended for this purpose is a simple balanced nested design (see schematic). [...] Typically 10-30 CRM units are taken from the batch at random; <b>stratified</b> <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> is recommended so that the selected units are spread across the batch. An equal number of subsamples (usually two or three) is then taken from each CRM unit and measured. Subsamples are measured in random order. Other designs, such as randomized block designs, have also been used for CRM certification.|$|E

Since January 2007, the survey is conducted with approximately 4,600 household respondents (<b>stratified</b> <b>random</b> <b>sampling)</b> in 18 cities: Jakarta, Bandung, Semarang, Surabaya, Medan, Makassar, Bandar Lampung, Palembang, Banjarmasin, Padang, Pontianak, Samarinda, Manado, Denpasar, Mataram, Pangkal Pinang, Ambon, and Banten. At a significance level of 99%, the survey has a sampling error of 2%. Data canvassing run through interviews by phone and direct visits in particular cities {{that is based on}} rotational system. The Balance Score Method (net balance + 100) has been adopted to construct the index, where the index above 100 points indicates optimism (positive responses) and vice versa.

50|$|The {{sample is}} chosen from the {{sampling}} frame, {{which consists of}} {{a list of all}} members of the population of interest. The goal of a survey is not to describe the sample, but the larger population. This generalizing ability is dependent on the representativeness of the sample, as stated above. Each member of the population is termed an element. There are frequent difficulties one encounters while choosing a representative sample. One common error that results is selection bias. Selection bias results when the procedures used to select a sample result in over representation or under representation of some significant aspect of the population. For instance, if the population of interest consists of 75% females, and 25% males, and the sample consists of 40% females and 60% males, females are under represented while males are overrepresented. In order to minimize selection biases, <b>stratified</b> <b>random</b> <b>sampling</b> is often used. This is when the population is divided into sub-populations called strata, and random samples are drawn from each of the strata, or elements are drawn for the sample on a proportional basis.|$|E
