5|$|Lieutenant Bourguignon had {{exchanged}} commands with Lieutenant Guiard on 20 March 1940, Guiard taking Bourguignon's former {{position at}} the casemate of Thonne-le-Thil.

Thouémont, who had been previously posted to a machine gun battalion in the 149th and 132nd RIF, lacked <b>specific</b> <b>training</b> on Maginot systems. He replaced Captain André, a reservist and mayor of Villy, who had been promoted. Bourguignon was responsible for command of Block 1, {{as well as for}} overall command.

5|$|Stratton saw humans not as {{machines}} {{to be analyzed}} mechanistically, but also as seating will, emotion and drives, all of which had to analyzed as scientifically as the traditional psychological concepts of sensation, perception and memory. He also believed in a supreme actuality behind the world registered by our senses. This was the theme of his last published book, Man-Creator or Destroyer, completed in 1952 when he was eighty-seven years old. His book Developing Mental Power was a foray into educational psychology, addressing the question of general versus <b>specific</b> <b>training</b> in terms teachers could understand and use. Stratton aimed at this goal via a simple and generally applicable look at the basic workings of mental life. John F. Dashiell, writing in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, found this a failure. Dashiell saw the path from the psychological concepts—emotion, intelligence, and will—to teaching methodology, not clearly described in the book. Stratton also applied psychological concepts {{to figure out how}} to avert war. He was optimistic it was possible to harness the creative and destructive facets of individuals to get nations to coexist peacefully. He saw nations as consisting of ethnicities and races which had to coexist in harmony. In line with the prevailing view in his field, he did not see the races as inherently equally intelligent.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{intention}} {{of this study}} was to examine the effect using <b>specific</b> balance <b>training</b> methods in order to improve competence and balance during the initial phase snowboarding. Method. 20 recreational snowboarders (22 ± 1. 5) were split into two separate conditions, a control condition (n= 10) and an experiment condition (n= 10). The control condition completed <b>specific</b> strength <b>training,</b> and the experiment condition performed <b>specific</b> balance <b>training</b> exercises. Each condition performed three separate balance tests on the RS footscan, Star Excursion Balance Test and Snowboard balance test, both pre and post intervention. Results. <b>Specific</b> balance <b>training</b> does have an effect on balance abilities in relation to the snowboarding balance test compared to strength training. Increasing stability by 37 % for the balance training and 1 % in strength <b>training.</b> However, <b>specific</b> balance <b>training</b> has minimal to no effect in relation to strength training on footscan balance capabilities and Star Excursion Balance Test scores. Both conditions diminish postural control in single foot capability tasks. Conclusion. <b>Specific</b> balance <b>training</b> has a positive effect on snowboarding balance when on the snowboarding test; the use of stability cushions was a key factor in this result. The results of the other tests showed no difference between the two conditions, which is down to the duration of the intervention training being too short. The participants were unable to obtain specific motor skills that would see improvements in balance abilities...|$|R
