5|$|The {{companion}} {{which is}} supposed to have spun-up PSR B1937+21 is no longer present, making it one of few millisecond pulsars which does not have a stellar mass companion. The generally high occurrence of companions to millisecond pulsars is to be expected, considering a companion is necessary to <b>spin-up</b> millisecond pulsars to their short periods. However, millisecond pulsars do not actively accrete matter from a companion, but instead need to have only done this at some time in the past, and thus the lack of companion for PSR B1937+21 is not seen as a being in disagreement with the <b>spin-up</b> model. Possible mechanisms for creating isolated millisecond pulsars include evaporation of the donor star or tidal disruption of the system.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Mobile {{computers}} typically {{spin down}} their hard disk after a fixed period of inactivity. If this threshold is too long, the disk wastes energy; {{if it is}} too short, the delay due to spinning the disk up again frushates the user.

Also, different users may have varying priorities with respect to trading off energy conservation against performance. We describe a method for varying the spin-down threshold dynamically by adapting to the user's access patterns and priorities.

40|$|Abstract Reducing energy {{consumption}} {{is critical to}} prolonging the battery life in portable devices. With rising energy costs and increases in {{energy consumption}} by devices in stationary systems energy expenses of large corporations can annually reach into millions of dollars. Subsequently, energy management has also become important for desktop machines in large scale organizations. While energy management techniques for portable devices can be utilized in stationary systems, they do not consider network resources readily available to stationary workstations. We propose a network-aware energy management mechanism that provides a low-cost solution that can significantly reduce energy consumption in the entire system while maintaining responsiveness of local interactive workloads. The key component {{of the system is}} a novel program-context-based bandwidth predictor that accurately predicts application’s bandwidth demand for file server/client interaction.

40|$|Chandra has {{detected}} optically thin, thermal X-ray emission {{with a size}} of ~ 1 arcsec and luminosity ~ 10 ^ 33 erg/s {{from the}} direction of the Galactic supermassive black hole (SMBH), Sgr A*. We suggest that a significant or even dominant fraction of this signal may be produced by several thousand late-type main-sequence stars that possibly hide in the central ~ 0. 1 pc region of the Galaxy. As a result of tidal <b>spin-ups</b> caused by close encounters with other stars and stellar remnants, these stars should be rapidly rotating and hence have hot coronae, emitting copious amounts of X-ray emission with temperatures kT<~ a few keV. The Chandra data thus place an interesting upper limit on the space density of (currently unobservable) low-mass main-sequence stars near Sgr A*. This bound is close to and consistent with current constraints on the central stellar cusp provided by infrared observations. If coronally active stars do provide a significant fraction of the X-ray luminosity of Sgr A*, it should be variable on hourly and daily time scales due to giant flares occurring on different stars. Another consequence is that the quiescent X-ray luminosity and accretion rate of the SMBH are yet lower than believed before. Comment: 18 pages, 7 figures. Accepted to MNRA...|$|R

The workload variability is more enhanced during the first month of the drive’s life than afterward. Our analysis shows that the drives are generally underutilized. Yet, there is a portion of them, about 10 %, that experience higher utilization levels. Also, the data sets indicate that the majority of disk drives WRITE more than they READ during their lifetime.
