5|$|In {{addition}} to concerts, {{music from the}} series has been released as <b>sheet</b> music. On January 20, 2004, Mitsuda released Partitura Originale Di Xenosaga Episodio Uno <b>Sheet</b> Music, a book of orchestral <b>sheet</b> music for tracks from Episode I, through his record label Procyon Studio. The book contains 22 songs, composed and arranged by Mitsuda. In {{addition to}} that book, DOREMI Music Publishing published a book of piano <b>sheet</b> music, Xenosaga Episode I Der Wille zur Macht Piano Solo <b>Sheet</b> Music. The book contains 21 songs, arranged by Asako Niwa as beginning to intermediate-level piano solos.

5|$|<b>Sheet</b> Harbour is a {{small rural}} {{community}} located on the Eastern Shore of Nova Scotia, in the eastern area of the Halifax Regional Municipality. The catchment area around the community includes approximately 5,500 people. <b>Sheet</b> Harbour is located slightly more northward compared to other coastal communities in the area, due {{to the shape of}} the harbour. The population of Census Tract 2050154.00, which includes <b>Sheet</b> Harbour and a large amount of land around <b>Sheet</b> Harbour's land borders, is 3,478 as of the 2011 Canadian Census. Census tracts are small subdivisions of land that are used for statistics gathering by Statistics Canada that usually have a population of 2,500 to 8,000. Each census tract has a numerical designation. The population of the community of <b>Sheet</b> Harbour is about 800. Immediately west of <b>Sheet</b> Harbour is <b>Sheet</b> Harbour 36, a small Mi'kmaq reserve.|$|E

30|$|The {{interaction}} between GO <b>sheets</b> and MMT <b>sheets</b> was studied. GO <b>sheets</b> and MMT <b>sheets</b> were repelled through electrostatic repulsion. There {{were a few}} negative charges {{at the edges of}} GO <b>sheets</b> and on the surface of MMT <b>sheets.</b> The hydroxyl groups of GO were attracted by the oxygen atoms through hydrogen bonds. An equilibrium was reached between repulsive and attractive forces. With enhancement of the attractive force, the equilibrium was broken, and then GO <b>sheets</b> were adsorbed on the surface of MMT <b>sheets</b> and some GO <b>sheets</b> inserted into the interlayer space of MMT. The adsorption and insertion of GO <b>sheets</b> were the main mechanism to form a stable assembly structure based on GO nano-sheets and MMT <b>sheets.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Antarctic <b>sheet</b> {{is divided}} by the Transantarctic Mountains into two unequal {{sections}} known as the East Antarctic ice <b>sheet</b> (EAIS) and the smaller West Antarctic Ice <b>Sheet</b> (WAIS). The EAIS rests on a major land mass but {{the bed of the}} WAIS is, in places, more than 2,500 metres below sea level. It would be seabed if the ice <b>sheet</b> were not there. The WAIS is classified as a marine-based ice <b>sheet,</b> meaning that its bed lies below sea level and its edges flow into floating ice shelves. The WAIS is bounded by the Ross Ice Shelf, the Ronne Ice Shelf, and outlet glaciers that drain into the Amundsen Sea.|$|E

5|$|Trunk 7 runs {{directly}} through <b>Sheet</b> Harbour. Route 224 and Route 374 both have junctions in <b>Sheet</b> Harbour. A new bridge was built across the Northeast Arm, {{and was named}} the East River Bridge, after its predecessor. Construction started in September 2014 and it was opened on 17 December 2015, with a bridge walk to commemorate the event. <b>Sheet</b> Harbour has a hospital, named Eastern Shore Memorial Hospital (ESMH), which is connected to Harbourview Lodge. The community is located about ten minutes northeast of Taylor Head Provincial Park. <b>Sheet</b> Harbour has one school: Duncan MacMillan High School (DMHS).

5|$|West Antarctica {{is covered}} by the West Antarctic Ice <b>Sheet.</b> The <b>sheet</b> has been of recent concern because of the real, if small, {{possibility}} of its collapse.

5|$|A book of piano <b>sheet</b> music {{arrangements}} {{from the}} original soundtrack has been arranged for the piano and published by DOREMI Music Publishing.

40|$|Polymer solutions, {{containing}} clay <b>sheets,</b> were electrospun into nanofibers and microfibers {{that contained}} clay <b>sheets</b> inside. Controllable removal of polymer by plasma etching {{from the surface}} of fibers revealed the arrangement of clay. The shape, flexibility, size distribution and arrangement of clay <b>sheets</b> were observed by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The clay <b>sheets</b> were partially aligned in big fibers with normal direction of clay <b>sheets</b> perpendicular to fiber axis. Crumpling of clay <b>sheets</b> inside fibers was observed when the fiber diameter was comparable to the lateral size of clay <b>sheets.</b> Single <b>sheets</b> of clay were observed both by catching clay <b>sheets</b> dispersed in water with electrospun nanofiber mats and by the deliberate removal of most of the polymer in the fibers. Thin, flexible gas barrier films, that are reasonably strong, were assembled from clay <b>sheets</b> and polymer nanofibers. Structure of composite films was characterized with scanning electron microscopy. Continuous film of clay <b>sheets</b> were physically attached to the surface of fiber mats. Spincoating film of polymer and clay <b>sheets</b> was reinforced by electrospun fiber scaffold. Certain alignment of clay <b>sheets</b> was observed in the vicinity of fibers...|$|R
5|$|A one-vertex crease pattern {{consists}} {{of a set of}} rays or creases drawn on a flat <b>sheet</b> of paper, all emanating from the same point interior to the <b>sheet.</b> (This point is called the vertex of the pattern.) Each crease must be folded, but the pattern does not specify whether the folds should be mountain folds or valley folds. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to fold the paper so that every crease is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, and the whole folded <b>sheet</b> of paper lies flat.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{the actual}} piano <b>sheet</b> music {{from each of}} the ten Final Fantasy Piano Collections albums has been {{published}} as ten corresponding music books by Yamaha Music Media. Each book contains the original music, exactly as arranged and performed on the albums. Unlike the Original Score arrangements, these pieces are intended only for advanced players as they are generally more difficult. <b>Sheet</b> music for the Final Fantasy XI Piano Collections album included in the Final Fantasy XI OST Premium Box Set was included in that box set, and, like the album itself, is unavailable for purchase elsewhere; <b>sheet</b> music for the identically named standalone piano album is published by Yamaha.|$|E

50|$|The {{number of}} <b>sheets</b> in a ream has varied locally over the centuries, often {{according}} to the size and type of paper being sold. Reams of 500 <b>sheets</b> (20 quires of 25 <b>sheets)</b> were known in England in c1594; in 1706 a ream was defined as 20 quires, either 24 or 25 <b>sheets</b> to the quire. In 18th- and 19th-century Europe, {{the size of the}} ream varied widely. In Lombardy a ream of music paper was 450 or 480 sheets; in Britain, Holland and Germany a ream of 480 <b>sheets</b> was common; in the Veneto it was more frequently 500. Some paper manufacturers counted 546 <b>sheets</b> (21 quires of 26 <b>sheets).</b> J.S. Bach's manuscript paper at Weimar was ordered by the ream of 480 <b>sheets.</b> In 1840, a ream in Lisbon was 17 quires and 3 <b>sheets</b> = 428 <b>sheets,</b> and a double ream was 18 quires and 2 <b>sheets</b> = 434 sheets; and in Bremen, blotting or packing paper was sold in reams of 300 (20 quires of 15 <b>sheets).</b> A mid-19th century Milanese-Italian dictionary has an example for a risma (ream) as being either 450 or 480 <b>sheets.</b>|$|R

5|$|Enron {{capitalized}} the Raptors, and, in {{a manner}} similar to the accounting employed when a company issues stock at a public offering, then booked the notes payable issued as assets on its balance <b>sheet</b> while increasing the shareholders' equity for the same amount.

50|$|A ream {{of paper}} is a {{quantity}} of <b>sheets</b> {{of the same size}} and quality.

Reams of 472 and 516 <b>sheets</b> are still current, but in retail outlets paper is typically sold in reams of 500. As an old UK and US unit, a perfect ream was equal to 516 <b>sheets.</b>|$|R
