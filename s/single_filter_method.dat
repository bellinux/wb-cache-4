40|$|A large {{class of}} {{acoustic}} noise sources has an underlying periodic process that generates a periodic noise component, and thus their acoustic noise can in general be modeled as {{the sum of}} a periodic signal and a randomly fluctuating signal (usually a broadband background noise). Active control of periodic noise (i. e., for a mixture of sinusoids) {{is more effective than}} that of random noise. For mixtures of sinusoids in a background broadband random noise, conventional FXLMS-based <b>single</b> <b>filter</b> <b>method</b> does not reach the maximum achievable Noise Attenuation Level (NALmax⁡). In this paper, an alternative approach is taken and the idea of a parallel active noise control (ANC) architecture for cancelling mixtures of periodic and random signals is presented. The proposed ANC system separates the noise into periodic and random components and generates corresponding antinoises via separate noise cancelling filters, and tends to reach NALmax⁡ consistently. The derivation of NALmax⁡ is presented. Both the separation and noise cancellation are based on adaptive filtering. Experimental results verify the analytical development by showing superior performance of the proposed method, over the single-filter approach, for several cases of sinusoids in white noise...|$|E

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 96 - 105. In {{the first}} part of this thesis, relationships between the fractional Fourier transformation and Fourier optical systems are analyzed to further elucidate the importance of this transformation in optics. Then in the second part, the concept of repeated filtering is considered. In this part, the repeated <b>filtering</b> <b>method</b> is interpreted in two different ways. In the first interpretation the linear transformation between input and output is constrained to be of the form of repeated filtering in consecutive domains. The applications of this constrained linear transformation to signal synthesis (beam shaping) and signal restoration are discussed. In the second interpretation, general linear systems are synthesized with repeated filtering in consecutive domains, and the synthesis of some important linear systems in signal processing and the. synthesis of optical interconnection architectures are considered for illustrative purposes. In all of the examples, when our repeated <b>filtering</b> <b>method</b> is compared with <b>single</b> domain <b>filtering</b> <b>methods,</b> significant improvements in performance are obtained with only modest increases in optical or digital implementation costs.

40|$|Hard Target Penetration is a {{very complex}} dynamic problem, and {{penetration}} signals contain axial de-acceleration signals, vibration signals and other weakly noise signals. It is difficult to obtain penetration feature signals through some <b>methods</b> <b>filtering</b> unwanted vibration signals and noise signals. As such, we propose a joint <b>filtering</b> <b>method</b> based on EEMD (Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition) and WT (Wavelet Transform) to solve this problem. This method consists of four main steps: (a) penetration signals decomposing via EEMD method, this gets the IMF (Intrinsic Mode Function) components, (b) then we calculate the Whole BURG power spectrum of the original signals and each component, after that compare the power spectrum of each component with the original signals, this draws the original signals EEMD decomposition scale, (c) the high-frequency components of IMF filtering based on the WT threshold, (d) signals reconstruct by using low-frequency IMF components which reflect signals characteristic and high-frequency IMF components through wavelet filtered. Experiment show that proposed method can effectively determine the penetration signals decomposition scale, eliminate vibration and noise signals of penetration process, avoid the losing of the high-frequency components when using a <b>single</b> wavelet <b>filtering</b> <b>method.</b> The result of the proposed method can get better SNR than WT, the velocity and depth are in good agreement with the results of experiment...|$|R

In this thesis, {{we first}} give {{a brief summary}} of the {{fractional}} Fourier transform which is the generalization of the ordinary Fourier transform, discuss its importance in optical and digital signal processing {{and its relation to}} time-frequency representations. We then introduce the concept of filtering circuits in fractional Fourier domains. This concept unifies the multi-stage (repeated) and multi-channel (parallel) filtering configurations which are in turn generalizations of <b>single</b> domain <b>filtering</b> in fractional Fourier domains. We show that these filtering configurations allow a cost-accuracy tradeoff by adjusting the number of stages or channels. We then consider the application of these configurations to three important problems, namely system synthesis, signal synthesis, and signal recovery, in optical and digital signal processing. In the system and signal synthesis problems, we try to synthesize a desired system characterized by its kernel, or a desired signal characterized by its second order statistics by using fractional Fourier domain filtering circuits. In the signal recovery problem, we try to recover or estimate a desired signal from its degraded version.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new method to inspect alu-minum castings automatically from {{a sequence of}} radioscopic im-ages taken at different positions of the casting. The classic image processing methods for flaw detection of aluminum castings use a bank of filters to generate an error-free reference image. This reference image is compared with the real radioscopic image, and flaws are detected at the pixels where the difference between them is considerable. However, the configuration of each filter depends strongly on {{the size and shape}} of the structure of the casting under inspection. A new two-step technique is proposed to detect flaws automatically that uses a <b>single</b> <b>filter.</b> First, the <b>method</b> identi-fies potential defects in each image of the sequence and second, it matches and tracks them from image to image. The key idea of this work is to consider as false alarms those potential defects which cannot be tracked in the sequence. The robustness and reliability of the method have been verified on both real data in which syn-thetic flaws have been added and real radioscopic image sequences recorded from cast aluminum wheels with known defects. Using this method the real defects can be detected with high certainty. This approach achieves good discrimination from false alarms.
