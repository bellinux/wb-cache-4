Support for partial predication was added in the form of conditional move instructions for both GPRs and FPRs; and an implementation could choose between having precise or imprecise exceptions for IEEE 754 traps.|$|E

25|$|When Boris I {{assumed the}} throne of Bulgaria in 852, the country was still pagan, with the ruling Bulgar elite being Tengriists while the Slavic {{population}} practised its own religion. Christianity was already widespread in Bulgaria as the country was established on former territories of the Byzantine Empire, and {{seems to have been}} influential. Even one of the sons of Khan Omurtag (r. 814–831), Enravota, converted to Christianity. The Bulgarian nobility was strongly opposed to any form of Byzantine influence in the country and was therefore hostile to Christianity as it was directly associated with the Byzantine Empire. Boris I, however, had many reasons to consider conversion— Bulgaria was situated between two powerful Christian empires, Byzantium and East Francia; Christian doctrine particularly favoured the position of the monarch as God's representative on Earth; and finally, Boris also saw Christianity as a way to overcome the differences between Bulgars and Slavs. The geopolitical situation in the mid 9th century was also favourable because of the increasing friction and rivalry between the Papacy in Rome and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople for influence in Central Europe. That struggle between the two churches would give the Bulgarian ruler the opportunity to manoeuvre and negotiate with both, thus extracting favourable concessions while keeping the country out of direct foreign influence. When the Byzantines invaded Bulgaria in the autumn of 863 and demanded conversion to Christianity from Constantinople as the <b>single</b> <b>condition</b> to retreat, Boris I readily accepted and was baptised in the beginning of 864, assuming the Christian name Michael after his spiritual godfather, the Byzantine Emperor Michael III. That step was very unpopular among the nobility, but when they rebelled Boris I dealt decisively with them and executed 52 magnates along with their whole families. When in the following year the Byzantines sturdily demonstrated their determination not to allow the existence of an autocephalous Bulgarian Church, Boris I decided to turn to the Papacy.|$|E

40|$|This paper derives {{sufficient}} {{conditions for}} a class of games of incomplete information, such as first-price auctions, to have pure strategy Nash equilibria (PSNE). The paper treats games were each agent has private information about her own type, and the types are drawn from an atomless joint probability distribution. The previous literature on existence of PSNE requires that (i) types are independently distributed, and (ii) the set of feasible actions is countable. This paper shows that a condition we call the <b>single</b> crossing <b>condition,</b> which is satisfied in many applications, allows those two assumptions to be relaxed. The <b>single</b> crossing <b>condition</b> can be roughly described as follows: whenever each opponent uses a nondecreasing strategy (in the sense that higher types choose higher actions), then a player's best response strategy is also nondecreasing in her type. The first result establishes that when the <b>single</b> crossing <b>condition</b> holds, a PSNE exists in every finite-action game [...] . ...|$|R

Neither from these however, nor from the official report of the Board (which has been since published), is any satisfactory explanation to be gained on this question--or indeed on any other question of importance. All, {{which is to be}} collected from them, is this: the Portugueze General, it appears, offered to unite his whole force with the British on the <b>single</b> <b>condition</b> that they should be provisioned from the British stores; and, accordingly, rests his excuse for not co-operating on the refusal of Sir Arthur Wellesley to comply with this condition. Sir A.W. denies the validity of his excuse; and, more than once, calls it a pretence; declaring that, in his belief, Gen. Freire's real motive for not joining was--a mistrust in the competence of the British to appear in the field against the French. This however is mere surmise; and therefore cannot have much weight with those who sincerely sought for satisfaction on this point: moreover, it is a surmise of the individual whose justification rests on making it appear that the difficulty did not arise with himself; and it is right to add, that the only fact produced goes to discredit this surmise; viz. that Gen. Friere did, without any delay, furnish the whole number of troops which Sir Arthur engaged to feed. However the Board exhibited so little anxiety to be satisfied on this point, that no positive information was gained.|$|E
6000|$|A {{year ago}} general pardon and amnesty, upon {{specified}} terms, were offered to all except certain designated classes, {{and it was}} at the same time made known that the excepted classes were still within contemplation of special clemency. During the year many availed themselves of the general provision, and many more would, only that the signs of bad faith in some led to such precautionary measures as rendered the practical process less easy and certain. During the same time also special pardons have been granted to individuals of the excepted classes, and no voluntary application has been denied. Thus practically the door has been for a full year open to all except such as were not in condition to make free choice; that is, such as were in custody or under constraint. It is still so open to all. But the time may come, probably will come, when public duty shall demand that it be closed and that in lieu more rigorous measures than heretofore shall be adopted. In presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the national authority {{on the part of the}} insurgents as the only indispensable condition to ending the war on the part of the Government, I retract nothing heretofore said as to slavery.
