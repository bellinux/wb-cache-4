5|$|Analysis {{of the two}} {{combat system}} {{proposals}} saw Signaal fall out of favour with the tender reviewers. This was primarily attributed to a cost-reducing re-design late in the process: the changes were not fully documented because of time constraints. <b>Supporting</b> <b>documentation</b> was further criticised by the reviewers for being vaguely worded and not using milspec terminology and standards. In addition, the system proposed by Rockwell appeared to have greater performance capabilities, and would be cheaper to implement.|$|E
5|$|A further three CH-47Fs {{were ordered}} in December 2015 for $US150 million, {{including}} spare parts, related equipment and some support costs. The ADF {{had intended to}} expand the CH-47F fleet at a later date, but the order was placed at short notice to use an under-spend on other Defence capabilities.

500|$|Little {{is known}} about Blackbeard's early life. [...] It is {{commonly}} believed {{that at the time}} of his death he was between 35and40 years old and thus born in about 1680. [...] In contemporary records his name is most often given as Blackbeard, Edward Thatch or Edward Teach; the latter is most often used. [...] Several spellings of his surname exist—Thatch, Thach, Thache, Thack, Tack, Thatche and Theach. [...] One early source claims that his surname was Drummond, but the lack of any <b>supporting</b> <b>documentation</b> makes this unlikely. [...] Pirates habitually used fictitious surnames while engaged in piracy, so as not to tarnish the family name, and this makes it unlikely that Teach's real name will ever be known.|$|E
500|$|Historian Ronald Hutton also scrutinised Liddell's claims, {{although}} {{added that}} he had corresponded with Liddell [...] "at length and in detail", {{over the course of}} which he had come to like him, noting that [...] "he has responded to often forceful criticisms with patience, modesty, and good humour". However, Hutton highlighted that no independent witnesses have emerged to support the existence of Liddell's alleged informants, while no <b>supporting</b> <b>documentation</b> has appeared to back any of his many claims. Hutton deemed this particularly unusual, because were Liddell's claims to have been accurate, much documentary evidence could be expected to exist. Focusing on Liddell's claim that Crowley had been initiated into one of Pickingill's covens during the 1890s, Hutton noted that {{there is no mention of}} Pickingill or a witches' coven in either Crowley's published work or personal diaries, and that similarly there was no mention of either in the diaries of Bennett, who was Crowley's magical tutor during the 1890s.|$|E

2500|$|In 1838, {{at least}} twenty-eight Aborigines were murdered at the Myall Creek in New South Wales, {{resulting}} in the unprecedented conviction and hanging of six white and one African convict settlers by the colonial courts. Aborigines also attacked white settlers—in 1838 fourteen Europeans were killed at Broken River in Port Phillip District, by Aborigines of the Ovens River, almost certainly in revenge for the illicit use of Aboriginal women. Captain Hutton of Port Phillip District once told Chief Protector of Aborigines George Augustus Robinson that [...] "if {{a member of a}} tribe offend, destroy the whole." [...] Queensland's Colonial Secretary A.H. Palmer wrote in 1884 [...] "the nature of the blacks was so treacherous that they were only guided by fear—in fact it was only possible to rule...the Australian Aboriginal...by brute force".

40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} a scoping study that investigated the possible transfer of techniques for creation of electronic technical <b>support</b> <b>documentation</b> from {{the aerospace industry}} to the machine tool industry. Electronic maintenance manuals have been supplied by aircraft manufacturers over the past 20 years with demonstrated benefits. Despite research that indicates the likelihood of similar benefits for machine tool users, the supply of electronic technical <b>support</b> <b>documentation</b> (TSD) by machine tool manufacturers is rare, and the techniques {{for the creation of}} TSD are inefficient. This paper describes the relevant trends affecting the machine tool industry and the background of the use of electronic TSD in aerospace. Data was collected via interviews with technical authors, document users and software suppliers from both industry sectors, as well as a questionnaire and a workshop. The results were analysed to form a view of the potential for technology transfer over the next 5 years...|$|R
