The petit ouvrage d'infanterie is located on a <b>salient</b> <b>point</b> of the Cattenom Forest between the gros ouvrages Kobenbusch (to the north) and Galgenberg (to the south), which provided covering fire during June 1940, when Oberheid faced daily bombardments and infiltrations. Oberheid has been abandoned and after extensive vandalism has been sealed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the mean}} time, {{the main body}} of the French army {{advanced}} in great regularity in columns of corps. The left column, consisting of the III Corps (Vandamme's), to which was attached the 7th Infantry Division (Lieutenant General Girard's detached from the II Corps, Reille's which was then with Ney at Quatre Bras), being destined to advance against Saint-Amand, the most <b>salient</b> <b>point</b> of the Prussian position, and therefore having the shortest distance to pass over, was the first to take up its ground, preparatory to attack. Whilst thus engaged in making its preliminary dispositions for this purpose, it was cannonaded by the Prussian batteries posted on the Heights in rear of the village. Girard's Division took post on the left of Vandamme's Corps, and Domon's (light) Cavalry Division on the left of Girard's.|$|E
25|$|Silborne {{stated that}} a single glance at the Prussian position, {{as it has been}} described, will suffice to prove that Napoleon was in error as {{regarded}} Blücher's assumed line of battle, and that so far from its having been perpendicular to, it was, in the general military acceptation of the term, parallel with, the Namur road. He may however have been misled by the massing of the Prussian troops between the <b>salient</b> <b>point</b> of the position, Saint-Amand, and the road in question, {{as well as by the}} direction of the line of the occupied villages of Saint-Amand, Ligny, and Sombreffe. It must also be acknowledged that although the inference was incorrectly drawn, it accorded in substance with the real fact, that Blücher did rely upon the arrival of a portion of Wellington's forces by the Namur road from Quatre Bras.|$|E
40|$|Establishing correspondences between <b>salient</b> <b>points</b> on 3 D shapes {{results in}} a {{function}} mapping similar parts of 3 D objects. In this paper, we present a new method for establishing binary correspondences between <b>salient</b> <b>points</b> on 3 D shapes. Our algorithm is independent of the shape representation and the object topology. It does not require any prepositioning of the objects. Our method first detects stable <b>salient</b> <b>points</b> that are representative for {{certain parts of the}} shape. For each of these <b>salient</b> <b>points</b> it then computes an associated local shape descriptor. We introduce a matching energy between the <b>salient</b> <b>points</b> in two shapes which depends on the similarity of the descriptors and the spatial relationship of the <b>salient</b> <b>points.</b> An iterative optimization scheme determines a correspondence mapping between the <b>salient</b> <b>points</b> which minimizes this energy. The resulting binary correspondences between the <b>salient</b> <b>points</b> can be used for applications like 3 D shape retrieval based on similarity estimation, classification of 3 D objects, editing, and statistical shape analysis. It is especially useful as an initialization method for approaches relying on prior knowledge about corresponding points like cross parameterization or morphing...|$|R
30|$|Gradient-based methods, such as SIFT first {{generally}} {{determines the}} <b>salient</b> <b>points</b> {{of an image}} and then calculate the descriptor on those points. The identification of <b>salient</b> <b>points</b> helps to capture the best discriminative foreground and discard the unnecessary background information. However, the identification of <b>salient</b> <b>points</b> is not directly incorporated to these descriptors. Moreover, {{in most of the}} cases, these methods do not consider the impact of human visual perception. Further, the gradient-based features often fail to distinguish between two pixels with same gradients even though those gradients correspond to different local structures [38].|$|R

The proposed approach is based on <b>salient</b> <b>points</b> of the image space, thus minimizing the computational effort. <b>Salient</b> <b>points</b> are extracted from each frame. Their trajectories are computed between successive frames and the global mot ion model is estimated. Moving <b>salient</b> <b>points</b> are selected from which salient regions are estimated using an adaptive Mean- Shift process, based on the statistical properties of the <b>point</b> neighborhoods. The <b>salient</b> regions are then matched along the stream, using the <b>salient</b> <b>points</b> trajectories. The information carried by the proposed salient regions of activity is e valuated and we show that such a representation of the content forms suitable input for video content interpretation algorithms...|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{randomly}} generating Q-convex sets is considered. We present two generators. The first one uses the Q-convex hull {{of a set}} of random points in order to generate a Q-convex set included in the square [0, n) 2. This generator is very simple, but is not uniform and its performance is quadratic in n. The second one exploits a coding of the <b>salient</b> <b>points,</b> which generalizes the coding of a border of polyominoes. It is uniform, and is based on the method by rejection. Experimentally, this algorithm works in linear time in the length of the word coding the <b>salient</b> <b>points.</b> Besides, concerning the enumeration problem, we determine an asymptotic formula for the number of Q-convex sets according {{to the size of the}} word coding the <b>salient</b> <b>points</b> in a special case, and in general only an experimental estimation.

40|$|We {{present a}} method, {{based on the}} idea of <b>salient</b> <b>points,</b> for {{locating}} corresponding features between two different faces independently of scale, orientation and position. <b>Salient</b> <b>points</b> are those which have a low probability of being mistaken with other points in the face, and therefore {{are more likely to be}} correctly located in a second face. The local image structure at each image point is described by vectors of Cartesian differential invariants computed at a range of scales. <b>Salient</b> <b>points</b> lie in low density regions of the distribution of all vectors of invariants found in an image. The vectors of invariants of <b>salient</b> <b>points</b> are used to locate similar features in a second image. Results are presented showing that salient facial features can be relocated more reliably than arbitrary facial features. 1 Introduction When analysing images of faces we frequently begin by locating `salient' features on the face to facilitate further processing.

30|$|In our approach, {{we treat}} a Chinese character, {{word or phrase}} as an image pattern. We first detect salient key-points on the whole image and then extract local feature at those <b>salient</b> <b>points.</b> This local feature is {{invariant}} to the image orientation, scale, partial occlusion and affine transformation. The local descriptors from the query image are matched against those in the reference images. The one with the most number of matches emerges as the results. As {{long as there are}} enough <b>salient</b> <b>points</b> on the image, this approach works well. If the number of <b>salient</b> <b>points</b> is not enough, as with simple characters such as “一”, the image may not be recognized.
