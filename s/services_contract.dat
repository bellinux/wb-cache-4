25|$|UC Irvine is {{the last}} UC campus that {{subcontracts}} its food services. In summer of 2004, UCI {{signed a contract with}} Aramark, a food services corporation, granting it control of nearly all residential dining facilities and restaurants on university property. This includes UCI's three dining halls (Brandywine, Pippin Commons, and Mesa Commons) and three on-campus restaurants (Phoenix Grille, B.C.'s Cavern on the Green, and Bistro by the Bridge). ASUCI, which is partially responsible for negotiating UCI's food <b>services</b> <b>contract,</b> has justified the decision to offer Aramark its business with the argument that Aramark has pledged to invest millions of dollars into the university's food service infrastructure.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to assess the transition from traditional <b>service</b> <b>contracting</b> to performance-based <b>service</b> <b>contracting</b> at Department of Defense Field Contracting Activities. There {{has been an increase}} in spending on services over the past decade that has forced the Federal Government to review its policy on <b>service</b> <b>contracting.</b> In 1991, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy established policy for the acquisition of <b>services</b> using performance-based <b>contracting.</b> Interviews of Government contracting personnel and review of professional literature highlight barriers to performance-based <b>service</b> <b>contracting.</b> These barriers are: management of cultural change, education and training of Government and contractor personnel, adoption of best commercial practices, writing of performance-based statements of work, and the tasks involved in contract administration. This thesis makes recommendations for overcoming these barriers and provides guidance for successful implementation of performance-based <b>service</b> <b>contracting</b> within the Department of Defense.

This could further be strengthened by the application of the Contract Centralization design pattern that advocates establishing <b>service’s</b> <b>contract</b> as the only official entry point into the service.|$|R

In exchange, the Oilers received US$15 million, young star Jimmy Carson, 1988 first-round draft choice Martin Gelinas and the Kings' first round draft picks in 1989, 1991 and 1993. The trade occurred because Pocklington didn't want to risk Gretzky leaving Edmonton without getting anything in return. Gretzky had converted his personal <b>services</b> <b>contract</b> with Pocklington into a standard five-year player's contract with the Oilers {{in the summer of}} 1987 with an option to declare himself an unrestricted free agent after the 1988–89 season.

None of this was public knowledge at the time. However, the Oilers and their fans were still upset. Nelson Riis, the New Democratic Party leader in Canada's House of Commons, {{went so far as to}} ask the government to block the trade.

40|$|International audienceThe <b>service</b> <b>contract</b> {{is one of}} the {{fundamental}} design principles in the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Its goal is to express the features (e. g., services and capabilities) of Service Providers (SPs) so Service Consumers (SCs) can identify them to communicate correctly. The two most known <b>service</b> <b>contracts</b> in the literature are: WSDL for SOAP and WADL for REST. We identify that these <b>service</b> <b>contracts</b> suffer from several problems (e. g., they only allow expressing a limited set of features). Also, we notice from the literature a lack of <b>service</b> <b>contracts</b> dedicated for SC. In order to overcome these problems, we propose two Features Models (FMs) based on SOA design patterns that can be considered as generic and formal <b>service</b> <b>contracts</b> for SP and SC. We propose extensions to the Feature MetaModel (FMM) and semantic constraints that ensure generating fully functional, valid, customized and consistent SPs and SCs from the proposed FMs...|$|R

25|$|After touring duties for {{the album}} were finished, Metallica {{filed a lawsuit}} against Elektra Records, which tried to force the record label to {{terminate}} the band's contract and give the band ownership of their master recordings. The band based its claim on a section of the California Labor Code that allows employees to be released from a personal <b>services</b> <b>contract</b> after seven years. Metallica had sold 40million copies worldwide upon the filing of the suit. Metallica had been signed to the label for over a decade but was still operating under the terms of its original 1984 contract, which provided a relatively low 14% royalty rate. The band members said they were taking the action because they were ambivalent about Robert Morgado's refusal to give them another record deal along with Bob Krasnow, who retired from his job at the label shortly afterwards. Elektra responded by counter-suing the band, but in December 1994, Warner Music Group United States chairman Doug Morris offered Metallica a lucrative new deal in exchange for dropping the suit, which was reported to be even more generous than the earlier Krasnow deal. In January 1995, both parties settled out of court with a non-disclosure agreement. Metallica played the album in its entirety during the 2012 European Black Album Tour.|$|E

40|$|Belgian and French {{contract}} law both make of fundamental typological distinction between sales <b>contracts</b> and <b>service</b> <b>contracts.</b> It is commonly accepted that this distinction {{is based upon}} the difference between goods and services: a sales contractnbsp;# 39; contract for the transer of property in goods; a <b>service</b> <b>contract</b> is# 39;the' contract for the provision of services. This typological distinction {{is to be found in}} all contintental legal orders, although some contintental legal orders - such as the Dutch {{contract law}} system and to a lesser extent also the German system - have made an additional distinction between manual and intellectual <b>service</b> <b>contracts.</b> On a typological level, manual <b>service</b> <b>contracts</b> are situated somewhere in between sales <b>contracts</b> and intellectual <b>service</b> <b>contracts.</b> Contrary to continental legal orders Anglo-Saxon legal orders have not introduced such typological distinctions. These continental distinctions are not of a mere typological nature. Sales <b>contracts</b> and <b>services</b> <b>contracts</b> are subject to different sets of rules. In some instances these rules clearly contradict one another, at least at first glance, especially in French and Belgian law. Differentrules apply as regards the description of a good or a <b>service</b> in the <b>contract,</b> as regards price setting, as regards termination of the contract, as regards hidden defects, etc. Legal litterature has - for different reasons - criticized many of these regulatory distictions.
