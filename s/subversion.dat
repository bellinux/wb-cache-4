5|$|Dante's {{rewriting}} of the Lucanian scene 'recuperates' {{the witch}} Erichtho by making her {{necessary to the}} Dantean Virgil's status as guide: she thus functions {{in accord with the}} Christian providence that controls the advancement of the Commedias plot line. At the same time, the Lucanian Erichtho is both marginalized and subordinated to a higher power. In this sense, Dante's rewriting of Erichtho also undoes Lucan's <b>subversion</b> of the original Virgilian model.|$|E

Ito believes the horror of Uzumaki is effective due to its <b>subversion</b> of symbols which are normally positively portrayed in Japanese media, and its theme of protagonists struggling against a mysterious force stronger than themselves.|$|E
