40|$|Two {{classes of}} state {{estimation}} schemes, variational (4 DVar) and ensemble Kalman (EnKF), {{have been developed}} and used extensively by the weather forecasting community as tractable alternatives to the standard matrix-based Kalman update equations for the estimation of high- dimensional systems. Variational schemes iteratively minimize a cost function {{with respect to the}} state estimate, using efficient vector-based gradient descent methods, but fail to capture the moments of the PDF of this estimate. Ensemble Kalman methods represent well the principal moments of the PDF, accounting for the measurements with a sequence of Kalman-like updates with the covariance of the PDF approximated via the ensemble. Here, we first introduce a tractable method for updating an ensemble of estimates in a variational fashion, capturing correctly both the estimate and the leading moments of its PDF. We then extend this variational ensemble framework to facilitate its consistent hybridization with the ensemble Kalman smoother. Finally, it is shown that the resulting Hybrid (variational/Kalman) Ensemble Smoother (HEnS) significantly outperforms the existing 4 DVar and EnKF approaches used operationally today for high-dimensional state estimation.

40|$|Energy {{harvesting}} {{from the}} surrounding environment has become a hot topic in research as an alternative powering solution. The concept deals with scavenging, as well as, harvesting energy {{from the surrounding}} energy sources. Harvesting vibrations, through Micro-Power Generators (MPGs), has drawn {{a lot of attention}} recently due to the reduction in the power requirement of the current sensors and integrated ciruits, and the abundance of ambient vibrations in many environments. Vibration Micro-Power generators (VMPGs) use one of three transduction mechanisms: piezoelectric, electromagnetic or electrostatic. Although electrostatic MPGs are the most compatible mechanism with ICs technology, many challenges face their optimal operation including low efficiency due to power electronics switching losses, the need for pre-charge, and the inability to operate in vibration environments with low frequencies and amplitudes. The objective of this thesis is to develop novel electrostatic micro-power generators using <b>switchless</b> architecture to achieve low cost, small footprint, self-sustained and optimal power generation in different vibration environments including low frequencies and amplitudes. The first electrostatic MPG uses an out-of-plane capacitive transducer. The new generator is sensitive enough to extract output power at very low base excitations. It is designed to use ready-made electret as a charging source and is therefore portable and self-sustained. Moreover, the new MPG can be configured as a wideband MPG in its impact mode of operation. A bandwidth of up to 9 Hz has been realized in this mode of operation. An improved version of the MPG is also presented that produces almost 1 mW output power at a base excitation amplitude and frequency of 0. 08 g (RMS) and 86 Hz. Two nonlinear models developed for the free-flight and impact modes of operation of the MPG are presented to allow future analysis and optimization of the system. The second electrostatic MPG uses a novel interdigitated in-plane parallel plate electrostatic transducer. The new implementation can achieve 78 % more output power than the original cited implementation. The MPG is fabricated using MEMS surface micromachining. The MPG introduces a new beam suspension system in which the source voltage is unlimited by the pull-in instability and low MPG center frequency can be realized. The MPG uses charged silicon nitride as a charging source. The MPG produces 65 mV at a base acceleration amplitude and frequency of 2 g and 1. 1 kHz. The prototype achieves 27 % less resonance frequency with only one eight the size of the previous implementation. A third electrostatic MPG architecture is introduced. The new architecture eliminates the need for restoring force elements (springs) in the MPG. The architecture can realize arbitrarily low MPG center frequency. It is suitable for both rectilinear and cylindrical structures and can be used with different vibration energy transduction methods. A prototype is fabricated and tested to demonstrate the feasibility of this architecture. The center frequency of the prototype is found to be 2 Hz demonstrating low frequency operation. The nonlinear behavior of <b>switchless</b> (continuous) electrostatic MPGs is further studied for optimal power operation. A consistent approximate analytical solution is developed to describe the nonlinear behavior of <b>switchless</b> comb-finger electrostatic MPGs. The method of multiple scales is used to develop such model.

Given N simultaneously transmitting nodes, p N wavelengths are required in an AWG based single-hop network compared to N wavelengths in a PSC based single-hop network. Due to the reduced wavelength pool size in AWG based WDM networks, tunable transmitters with a negligible tuning time can be deployed resulting in a signicantly smaller tuning penalty. In this paper it is shown analytically that for xed channel assignment the AWG clearly outperform the PSC in terms of aggregate throughput, mean queueing delay and packet loss.

40|$|Millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) {{wireless}} communication systems often employ phased array architecture {{to overcome the}} high path loss and to provide spatial selectivity. As the number of elements in the array increases, the complexity {{as well as physical}} area required for the circuitry also increase. This calls for circuit blocks that are multifunctional and can be electronically reconfigured. This dissertation presents the analyses, designs and implementations of electronically reconfigurable circuit blocks that operate bidirectionally and at multiple frequency bands. The first part of the dissertation discusses three mm-Wave reconfigurable circuit blocks realized using the constructive wave amplification technique (CCWA) in both SiGe BiCMOS and CMOS SOI processes. First, a power amplifier is designed at 60 GHz in a 0. 12 -μm SiGe BiCMOS process that incorporates a CMOS-bipolar cascode (BiFET) feedback circuit topology. Second, a dual Q- and W- band, bidirectional amplifier is demonstrated in a 45 -nm CMOS SOI process where operations at different bands and directions are realized by electronically config- uring the feedback “field of FETs”. The bidirectional concept is then extended to the design of a three-port V-band reconfigurable active circulator that directs traveling waves between different pairs of ports while providing isolation from the remaining ports. Secondly, a <b>switchless</b> bidirectional front-end architecture is demonstrated in a 90 -nm SiGe BiCMOS process. The proposed architecture enables a time-division duplexed (TDD) operation without the use of high-speed transmit and receive (T/R) switch. A passive transmission line matching network is used to isolate the power amplifier and low-noise amplifier and a bidirectional passive mixer is used for up- and down-conversion of the signal. The front-end is incorporated to a two-element linear coupled oscillator array to form a local oscillator beamforming transceiver. Finally, a high-speed track-and-hold amplifier (THA) is demonstrated in a 90 -nm SiGe BiCMOS process. This work demonstrates the competitiveness of advance integrated silicon processes when being benchmarked against high performance III-V processes. The continuous improvement of silicon-based transistors will allow integrated systems to operate at higher frequencies.
