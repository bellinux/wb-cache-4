The resulting pattern, known as "washboard" or "corrugated" road, is common on dry, unpaved roads. We investigated this phenomenon theoretically and experimentally, using laboratory-scale apparatus and beds of dry sand. A {{thick layer of}} sand on a circular track was forced by a rolling wheel on an arm whose weight and moment of inertia could be varied. We compared the ripples made by the rolling wheel to those made using a simple inclined plow blade. We investigated the dependence of the critical speed on various parameters, and describe a scaling argument {{which leads to a}} dimensionless ratio, analogous to the hydrodynamic Froude number, which controls the instability.

These procedures are generally based upon two key steps: (i) performing a nonlinear static (pushover) analysis under lateral forces and (ii) evaluating the seismic demand through the so-called capacity spectrum obtained {{at the end of}} the previous step. This paper specifically deals with the latter and proposes a parametric comparison between two wide classes of methods formally based on conceptually alternative approaches for defining the demand spectra in nonlinear <b>static</b> analyses of <b>dissipative</b> structures. First of all, the paper outlines the main conceptual aspects of such alternative methods and reports their key operational details. Particularly, it proposes a dimensionless formulation of their relationships and demonstrates that both methods are based upon a small and almost common set of dimensionless parameters. Therefore, a wide parametric analysis is proposed to compare the ductility demand obtained by means of these two alternative methods with the aim of describing and quantifying the different predictions obtained by applying such methods. Finally, the results of nonlinear time-history analyses are proposed for assessing the two aforementioned methods...|$|R

Musculo-articular <b>dissipative</b> properties were assessed by calculating a dissipation coefficient using potential elastic energies stored and restituted during cyclic stretching. Eight subjects performed five passive knee extensions/flexions cycles on a Biodex dynamometer at 5 degrees/s to 80 % of their maximal range of motion before and after a static stretching protocol. Electromyographic activity from the hamstring muscles was monitored and remained constant during cyclic stretching and after static stretching (p > 0. 05). The dissipation coefficient decreased during cyclic stretching (- 28. 8 +/- 6. 0 %, p < 0. 001), while it was slightly increased after static stretching (+ 3. 8 +/- 5. 0 %, p = 0. 037). The findings showed that energy stored and energy restituted decreased during cyclic stretching and after static stretching (p < 0. 05). During unloading, passive torque remained constant during cyclic stretching, but was decreased after static stretching. The findings indicate that musculo-articular dissipative properties were primarily affected by a single cycle of motion, and were not influenced by static stretching procedures. The decrease in dissipation coefficient following cyclic motion indicates that the musculo-articular system displays thixotropic behavior...|$|R

40|$|Open {{physical}} {{systems with}} balanced loss and gain exhibit a transition, absent in their solitary counterparts, which engenders modes that exponentially decay or grow {{with time and}} thus spontaneously breaks the parity-time PT symmetry. This PT-symmetry breaking is induced by modulating the strength or the temporal profile of the loss and gain, but also occurs in a pure dissipative system without gain. It has been observed that, in classical systems with mechanical, electrical, and electromagnetic setups with static loss and gain, the PT-symmetry breaking transition leads to extraordinary behavior and functionalities. However, its observation in a quantum system {{is yet to be}} realized. Here we report on the first quantum simulation of PT-symmetry breaking transitions using ultracold Li- 6 atoms. We simulate <b>static</b> and Floquet <b>dissipative</b> Hamiltonians by generating state-dependent atom loss in a noninteracting Fermi gas, and observe the PT-symmetry breaking transitions by tracking the atom number for each state. We find that while the two-state system undergoes a single transition in the static case, its Floquet counterpart, with a periodic loss, undergoes PT-symmetry breaking and restoring transitions at vanishingly small dissipation strength. Our results demonstrate that Floquet dissipation offers a versatile tool for navigating phases where the PT-symmetry is either broken or conserved. The dissipative ultracold Fermi gas provides a starting point for exploring the interplay among dissipation, decoherence, and interactions in open quantum systems.

50|$|Conductive {{antistatic}} {{bags are}} manufactured {{with a layer}} of conductive metal, often aluminum, and a dielectric layer of plastic covered in a <b>static</b> <b>dissipative</b> coating. This forms both a shield and a non-conductive barrier, shielding the contents from static charge via the Faraday cage effect. These bags are preferred for more sensitive parts, but they also see use in environments where sparks would be hazardous, such as oxygen-rich areas in aircraft and hospitals. Metalized bags are more fragile than their nonmetal counterparts, however, as any puncture compromises the integrity of the shield. In addition, they have a limited shelf life, as the metal substrate can deteriorate over time. These bags are often gray or silver owing to the metal layer, while still being transparent to some degree.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{dielectric}} {{nature of}} electronics component and assemblies, electrostatic charging {{can not be}} completely prevented during handling of devices. Most of ESD sensitive electronic assemblies and components are also so small that manufacturing and handling is done with automated equipment. ESD prevention activities are therefore important with those processes where components come into direct contact with equipment surfaces. In addition, {{it is important to}} prevent ESD when an electrostatic discharge sensitive component is connected with other conductive parts of the product itself. An efficient way to prevent ESD is to use materials that are not too conductive but will slowly conduct static charges away. These materials are called <b>static</b> <b>dissipative</b> and have resistivity values in the range of 105 to 1012 ohm-meters. Materials in automated manufacturing which will touch on conductive areas of ESD sensitive electronic should be made of dissipative material, and the dissipative material must be grounded.|$|E
50|$|Dissipative {{antistatic}} bags, as {{the name}} suggests, are made of standard polyethylene with a <b>static</b> <b>dissipative</b> coating or layer on the plastic. This prevents buildup of a static charge {{on the surface of}} the bag, as it dissipates the charge to ground (i.e., whatever other surface it is touching). This bridge to ground is achieved with the inclusion of a tallow amine on the bags surface which attracts moisture that can conduct the charge to another surface, or to the atmosphere itself. In this sense, this type is truly 'antistatic' in that it hinders the formation of static charges. It, however, is not resistant to electrostatic discharge; if something else with a charge touches the bag (such as a persons hand), its charge would easily transfer through the bag and its contents. These bags are usually pink or red in color because of the dissipative chemical layer. Black bags also exist, wherein the polyethylene is manufactured containing trace amounts of carbon, forming a partial shield, though not a complete one.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} controlling a class of nonlinear multibody exible space systems consisting of a exible central body to which a number of articulated appendages are attached. Collocated actuators and sensors are assumed, and global asymptotic stability of such systems is established under a nonlinear dissipative control law. The stability is shown to be robust to unmodeled dynamics and parametric uncertainties. For a special {{case in which the}} attitude motion of the central body is small, the system, although still nonlinear, is shown to be stabilized by linear dissipative control laws. Two types of linear controllers are considered: <b>static</b> <b>dissipative</b> (constant gain) and dynamic dissipative. The <b>static</b> <b>dissipative</b> control law is also shown to provide robust stability in the presence of certain classes of actuator and sensor nonlinearities and actuator dynamics. The results obtained for this special case can also be readily applied for controlling single-body linear exible space structures. For this case, a synthesis technique for the design of a suboptimal dynamic dissipative controller is also presented. The results obtained in this paper are applicable to a broad class of multibody and singlebody systems such as exible multilink manipulators, multipayload space platforms, and space antennas. The stability proofs use the Lyapunov approach and exploit the inherent passivity of such systems. 1...|$|E

40|$|Nanostructured {{conducting}} polymers {{have been}} synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerization, where the nucleation conditions have been intentionally modified to produce materials with high processability. These materials have been blended with conventional polymers and incorporated into polymer membranes via nonsolvent-induced phase separation. The membranes produced show tunable hydrophilicity, pore structure, and separation properties. Pure polyaniline membranes are super hydrophilic and have unusually high permeability. The pore structure and resultant separation properties of polyaniline ultrafiltration membranes have been modified {{by the use}} of 4 -methylpiperidine (4 MP) as a gel-inhibiting agent. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) rejection for polyaniline membranes is improved from 0 % to over 90 % when 4 MP is included in membrane casting solutions. Membranes cast with 4 MP are hydrophobic until an appropriate post-treatment method is applied. Treatment with camphorsulfonic acid recovers the hydrophilicity in these membranes through induction of the expanded coil conformation of polyaniline, where hydrophobic 4 MP molecules can now diffuse out of the polymer matrix. Polypyrrole nanospheres have been produced by rapidly initiated chemical oxidative polymerization and used to produce nanocomposite membranes with polysulfone. The nanocomposite membranes have high BSA rejection (> 80 %) and have permeabilities up to 5 times greater than pure polysulfone. Fouling experiments were performed on these membranes by monitoring the flux upon introduction of BSA and subsequent washing steps. Membranes containing as little as 2 % PPy nanospheres were resistant to both reversible and irreversible fouling by BSA proteins. Copolymer nanofibers of poly(aniline-co-ethylaniline) have been produced by rapidly-initiated chemical oxidative polymerization using the initiators p-phenylenediamine and N-phenyl- 1, 4 -phenylenediamine. Copolymer nanofibers are formed in all stoichiometries as determined by electron microscopy. Resulting copolymer compositions are enriched in ethylaniline due to the higher reactivity ratio of ethylaniline in comparison to aniline. All copolymers possess lower conductivity than the parent polyaniline nanofibers. Conductivity is highest in copolymer samples where p-phenylenediamine is used as an initiator.

The TGA investigation revealed that composites are thermally stable up to 200 degrees C after which they display multistep weight loss due to removal of functional groups and decomposition/carbonization of AC as well as polymeric backbone of AR. The SEM images show that incorporation of AC particles leads to systematic change in the morphology of composites.

40|$|Inhalational {{therapy is}} used to deliver {{medication}} to the lung, either to treat diseases or, less commonly, for systemic absorption. A number of devices {{have been developed to}} aid or improve inhalational therapy, and this thesis deals with metered dose inhalers, used with spacer devices, and nebulisers. Despite their seemingly simple construction and concept, the correct choice and use of an inhalational drug delivery device can dramatically alter the amount of drug available for inhalation. Studies in this thesis, supported by emerging pharmacokinetic evidence, have highlighted areas where the device can affect the drug delivery. In vitro methods were used to quantify and characterise the different devices, including inertial impaction for aerosol particle sizing, sinus flow pumps for breathing simulation and high speed video recordings to analyse aerosol plume geometry and spacer function. The results these studies reveal a number of factors that may affect drug delivery. Firstly, delay between metered dose inhaler actuation into a spacer and inhalation can reduce the amount of drug available to the patient. Secondly, multiple actuations of the metered dose inhaler into the spacer prior to inhalation also reduce the amount of drug available. The size of the spacer may also affect the amount of drug available for inhalation, and this will vary with the drug prescribed. Different formulations may differ in their aerosol cloud speed and volume, and this may alter the amount of drug delivered from different spacers. Plastic and polycarbonate spacers may be highly charged with static electricity. Such spacers deliver less drug than those where the static charge has been reduced by an anti-static lining, or where the spacer is constructed from <b>static</b> <b>dissipative</b> materials. Washing the spacer also reduces its charge, but the optimum washing regime for spacers is not known. Different nebulisers deliver different amounts of drug, and the assessment of nebulisers varies with the method used. Accurate assessment should include direct measurement of the mass of drug released, and should incorporate simulated patient breathing. Effective nebulisation of drug ends after a few minutes. This time will depend on the nebuliser and drug being used, but for some medications administered for asthma, little drug may be delivered after five minutes, and patients should be advised to stop nebulisation after this time. In conclusion, studies in this thesis support the hypothesis that the method of use or choice of inhalational drug delivery device affects the amount of drug that is available for inhalation by the patient...|$|E
