30|$|Fat-suppressed T 1 -weighted images (FST 1 WI) play an {{important}} role in detecting lesions because normal pancreatic parenchyma has either a homogeneous or cobblestone appearance and appears as hyperintense <b>signal</b> <b>areas</b> on FST 1 WI [20].

30|$|Due {{to their}} hypervascularity, paragangliomas {{typically}} demonstrate arterial spectral waveforms on ultrasound imaging, and intense homogenous contrast enhancement on computed tomography (CT) and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI). Feeding and draining vessels can also be identified on angiography. Larger tumors may enhance heterogeneously due to areas of necrosis and/or hemorrhage [6]. The classically described “salt and pepper” appearance of these tumors on MRI refers to high <b>signal</b> <b>areas</b> with slow flow or hemorrhage and low <b>signal</b> <b>areas</b> due to <b>signal</b> voids of tumor vessels classically described on T 1 -weighted imaging, but can also be on T 2 -weighted images [6].|$|R

50|$|It was {{previously}} placed in Section Lophiris {{because of a}} crest-like ridge in <b>signal</b> <b>area,</b> but Wu & Cutler Taxonomic, evolutionary and ecological implications of the leaf anatomy of rhizomatous Iris species in the Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society Vol. 90 page253 - 303 in 1985, showed that the iris should be within the Chinensis Series.

KCPW-FM's transmitter is located atop the Wells Fargo Center in downtown Salt Lake City. The 88.3 FM frequency does not broadcast in stereo audio, to improve reception in marginal <b>signal</b> <b>areas.</b> Because of FCC allocation considerations, 88.3 FM cannot use as much power {{as most of}} the other Salt Lake City FM stations.|$|R
