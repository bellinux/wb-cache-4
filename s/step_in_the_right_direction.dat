5|$|After the Square Enix merger, {{however, the}} {{individual}} teams still continued to program and customize their own tools for each game, which would eventually {{go to waste}} as only their respective creators {{knew how to use}} them. With the amount of assets and tools required by the in-development Final Fantasy XII and the impending advent of the seventh console generation, a common data format for the company was proposed in 2004. It was to be developed in-house and replace general-purpose formats such as FBX and COLLADA. Realizing the goal of an engine with a common set of tools proved to be difficult, as many production teams wanted to further their own interests rather than those of the company as a whole. Select staff members from different company divisions teamed up to work on the project on a voluntary basis, but their loose organizational structure failed to yield results. Nevertheless, Murata considered this group effort a first <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction.</b> In 2005, he was appointed general manager of the newly formed Technology Division. Although this enabled Murata and his subordinates to talk about a company-wide engine more extensively, the lack of manpower again prevented any significant achievements.|$|E

Women in the video game industry describe the character as both a positive and negative influence.

She stated that the over-sexualized appearance was overlooked because the character was a [...] "breath of fresh air". However, Roby felt that though Lara Croft's proportions have become more realistic, the character's personality was diluted by the developer's actions to appeal to a male audience. LesbianGamers.com's Tracy Whitelaw called the character a dichotomy, stating that though Croft is viewed as [...] "idealized" [...] with an [...] "unattainable body", the character was a great stride for the propagation of female characters as video game protagonists.|$|E

500|$|Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club wrote a mixed {{review and}} gave it a C+. He noted that the episode's closing scene, wherein Jim, Dwight, and Harry talk about Robert California ruining the company, was an example of a retcon that [...] "the shift to a world with actual {{consequences}} is certainly a <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction</b> for the series, and one that slightly elevates 'Turf War' if not the season as a whole." [...] However, McNutt was largely critical of the writing, noting that the closure of the Binghamton branch was a [...] "cheap segue" [...] that [...] "render the show's characters as subservient to the narrative whims of the writers." [...] He argued—specifically citing the unconcernedness that the Scranton employees showed after hearing that a neighboring branch was shut down—that many of the characters' motives were not effective because they simply acted as ciphers, through which the larger plots could unfold.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Kościuszko {{became more}} closely {{involved}} with the political reformers, befriending Hugo Kołłątaj, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and others. [...] Kościuszko argued that the peasants and Jews should receive full citizenship status, as this would motivate them to help defend Poland {{in the event of}} war. [...] The political reformers centered in the Patriotic Party scored a major victory with the adoption of the Constitution of May 3, 1791. Kościuszko saw the Constitution as a <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction,</b> but was disappointed that it retained the monarchy and did little to improve the situation of the most underprivileged, the peasants and the Jews. [...] The Commonwealth's neighbors saw the Constitution's reforms as a threat to their influence over Polish internal affairs. A year after the Constitution's adoption, on May 14, 1792, reactionary magnates formed the Targowica Confederation, which asked Russia's Tsaritsa Catherine II for help in overthrowing the Constitution. Four days later, on May 18, 1792, a 100,000-man Russian army crossed the Polish border, headed for Warsaw, beginning the Polish–Russian War of 1792.|$|E
500|$|The Naval Institute's Proceedings {{magazine}} devoted {{space in}} two of its 1902 issues to possible improvements in battleship design. The first article was authored by Lieutenant Matt H. Signor, who argued for a ship with [...] and /40 caliber guns in four triple turrets. The secondary battery would be composed of /60 guns. This paper provoked enough thought that Proceedings published comments on the story from Captain William M. Folger, Professor P.R. Alger and naval constructor David W. Taylor—an up-and-coming officer and future head of the Bureau of Construction and Repair (C). These comments expressed doubt that the proposed vessel could be modified into a feasible design, but they praised his thoughts as a <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction.</b> Alger believed that Signor {{was on the right}} track in suggesting larger armament, though he thought that triple turrets would be unworkable and eight 12-inch guns in four twin turrets would be a much more realistic arrangement.

500|$|The Maniac Mansion team {{wanted to}} retain the {{structure}} of a text-based adventure game, but without the standard command-line interface. Gilbert and Winnick were frustrated by the genre's text parsers and frequent game over screens. While in college, Gilbert had enjoyed Colossal Cave Adventure and the games of Infocom, but he disliked their lack of visuals. He found the inclusion of graphics in Sierra On-Line games, such as King's Quest, to be a <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction.</b> However, these games still require the player to type, and to guess which commands must be input. In response, Gilbert programmed a point-and-click graphical user interface that displays every possible command. Fox had made a similar attempt to streamline Lucasfilm's earlier [...] and he conceived the entirety of Maniac Mansions interface, according to Gilbert. Forty input commands were planned at first, but the number was gradually reduced to 12. Gilbert finished the Maniac Mansion engine—which he later named [...] "Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion" [...] (SCUMM)—after roughly one year of work. Although the game was designed for the Commodore 64, the SCUMM engine allowed it to be ported easily to other platforms.|$|E

500|$|CNN's Lisa Respers France {{said the}} episode {{failed to meet}} her expectations. She was {{concerned}} that Mercedes' plot may lead towards the character becoming unlikeable, and criticized Holly's sudden departure. Though she enjoyed Sunshine's return, seeing Kurt and Blaine at McKinley and Mercedes' solo, she noted [...] "all of those moments were fleeting and only contributed to the uneven feel of the show." [...] Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times called it a [...] "quirky mixed bag, packed with amusing bits and pieces but very little emotional (or musical) oomph.". Myles McNutt of The A.V.

He suggested that its purpose was to address two criticisms of the show: the under-use of its supporting cast members, and the [...] "maniacal behavior" [...] of Sue. McNutt wrote, [...] "not only was the execution on these endeavors spotty at best and outright obnoxious at worst, but the growing futility of continuity in this series renders any and all developments wholly temporary.

Most of the film material was found, but some segments of [...] "Portobello Road" [...] had to be reconstructed from work prints with digital re-coloration to match the film quality of the main content. The footage for [...] "A <b>Step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Right</b> Direction" [...] was never located. As of 2009, it remains lost, and {{it is believed that}} the footage was possibly destroyed. A reconstruction of [...] "A <b>Step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Right</b> Direction", using <b>the</b> original music track linked up to existing production stills, was included on the DVD as an extra to convey an idea of what the lost sequence would have looked like.

Lansbury had only made a demo recording, singing with a solo piano because the orchestrations would have been added when the picture was scored.

[...] In a mixed review, Robert Christgau described the album as [...] "A <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>direction,</b> but only a step".
