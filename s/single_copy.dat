5|$|Unfortunately for Brian, {{when his}} novel is released, it is universally panned by {{literary}} critics {{and does not}} sell a <b>single</b> <b>copy.</b> Brian laments that he sacrificed his core beliefs for nothing, but Lois intervenes because he helped ban cannabis (and she also points out how Stewie got to build a nice fort from all of Brian's unsold books). A distraught Quagmire arrives at the household and informs Peter that he is still looking for James and offers a reward of $50. Peter nonchalantly takes the reward, admits that he killed him and slams his door before Quagmire {{has a chance to}} react.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, despite {{changing}} musical trends, Peerson's music {{showed significant}} roots in Renaissance polyphony. However, he was adept {{in the use}} of then-modern compositional procedures; this is evident in his often daring use of chromaticism, especially seen in word painting. Some of his finest music is contained in his set of 15 Latin motets, which was probably composed {{around the turn of the}} century. Existing only in a <b>single</b> <b>copy,</b> it originally consisted of five part-books but the Cantus book is lost. Richard Rastall, professor of historical musicology at the University of Leeds, spent 12 years reconstructing the missing part. The complete Latin motets have been published by Antico Edition, and a recording of their performance by Ex Cathedra entitled Peerson: Latin Motets was produced by Hyperion Records in 2005.|$|E

25|$|Although Tacitus {{wrote the}} Histories before the Annals, {{the events in}} the Annals precede the Histories; {{together}} they form a continuous narrative from the death of Augustus (14) to the death of Domitian (96). Though most has been lost, what remains is an invaluable record of the era. The first half of the Annals survived in a <b>single</b> <b>copy</b> of a manuscript from Corvey Abbey, and the second half from a <b>single</b> <b>copy</b> of a manuscript from Monte Cassino, and so it is remarkable that they survived at all.|$|E

25|$|For {{its first}} three years, the Russian Free Press went on {{printing}} without selling a <b>single</b> <b>copy</b> and scarcely {{being able to}} get a <b>single</b> <b>copy</b> introduced into Russia; so when at last a bookseller bought ten shillings worth of Baptized Property, the half-sovereign was set aside by the surprised editors in a special place of honor. The death of the emperor Nicholas in 1855 led to a complete change. Herzen's writings, and the magazines he edited, were smuggled wholesale into Russia, and their words resounded throughout the country, as well as all over Europe. Their influence grew.|$|E
25|$|Unlike DNA replication, mRNA {{transcription}} {{can involve}} multiple RNA polymerases {{on a single}} DNA template and multiple rounds of transcription (amplification of particular mRNA), so many mRNA molecules can be rapidly produced from a <b>single</b> <b>copy</b> of a gene.|$|E

One study placed it in Saxifragales, but not at any particular position within that order. Doubts have been expressed about {{the results of this}} study. Another study placed Cynomorium in Rosales based on analysis of the two invert repeat regions of the chloroplast genome, which evolve at one fifth the rate of the two <b>single</b> <b>copy</b> regions.|$|E

25|$|As soon as an oral case {{presentation}} is finished, the justices retire for a closed {{meeting to discuss}} and vote on the case.

25|$|It is {{not known}} for sure whether Skaryna was Catholic or Orthodox. His name is Catholic, but it is often {{suggested}} that he changed it before entering the university. A <b>single</b> <b>copy</b> of a document {{in which he is}} called Georgius Franciscus instead of just Franciscus gave birth to a theory that Georgius was his original name; today, however, it is mostly accepted to be a scribe's error (the presumed correct reading being egregius Franciscus, venerable Francysk). In any case the once popular theory that he changed his name from Georgius to Franciscus to be able to enter the university is without ground: the name Georgius was equally popular among the Catholic and the Orthodox in the region, and in fact in Skaryna's year there were more students named Georgius than Franciscus in Kraków.|$|E
