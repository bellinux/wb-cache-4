40|$|This study {{deals with}} fuel {{injection}} in kraft recovery boilers used in pulp mills. Black liquor is sprayed into the furnace of a recovery boiler through large <b>splashplate</b> nozzles. The drop size and drop size distribution of black liquor sprays {{have a major}} impact on the operation of a recovery boiler. When they are entrained by upwards-flowing flue gas flow, small droplets form carry-over and cause the fouling of heat transfer surfaces. Large droplets hit the char bed and the walls of the furnace without being adequately dried. In this study, the drop size of black liquor with a high solids content was measured for two types of industrial-scale <b>splashplate</b> nozzles. The mass flow rate was varied between 4. 3 and 6. 1 kg/s and the spraying temperature was varied between 130 - 135 °C. The excess temperature above the elevated boiling point (EBP) varied between 14 - 18 °C. The drop size and drop size distribution of black liquor sprays were measured by an image-analysis-based method. Although the spray consisted of spherical and non-spherical particles, it was assumed that non-spherical particles would form spherical droplets. Four theoretical drop size distributions were compared by the method of least-square difference...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} that the trailing shoe application technique reduces phosphorus (P) in the runoff postslurry application {{when compared to the}} traditional splash-plate application technique. However, the effectiveness of the trailing-shoe technique as a means of reducing P losses has not been evaluated when slurry is applied during periods of high soil moisture levels and lower herbage covers. To address this issue, three treatments were examined in a 3 × 4 factorial design split-plot experiment, with treatments comprising three slurry treatments: control (no slurry), <b>splashplate</b> and trailing-shoe, and four slurry application dates: 7 December, 18 January, 1 March and 10 April. Dairy cow slurry was applied at a rate of 20 m 3 /ha, while simulated runoff was generated 2, 9 and 16 days later and analysed for a range of P fractions. Dissolved reactive P concentrations in runoff at day two was 41 % lower when slurry was applied using the trailing-shoe technique, compared to the splash-plate technique (P < 0. 05). In addition, P concentrations in runoff were higher (P < 0. 05) from slurry applied in December and March compared to slurry applied in January or April, coinciding with periods of higher soil moisture contents. While the latter highlights that ‘calendar’-based non-spreading periods might not always achieve the desired consequences, the study demonstrated that further field-scale investigations into the trailing shoe as a mitigation measure to reduced P loss from agricultural soils is warranted. peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A {{decline in}} water quality, caused by {{elevated}} levels of phosphorus (P), {{has resulted in a}} loss of biodiversity in many freshwater ecosystems across Northern Ireland. Agriculture has been identified as the primary driver of P induced eutrophication of surface waters in Northern Ireland, accounting for almost 60 % of P inputs to inland rivers and lakes. Following the introduction of the European Union Water Framework Directive (2000), action is now being taken to improve water quality in rivers and lakes within Northern Ireland. Whilst current mitigation strategies target reductions in P inputs to agricultural systems, there is also a need for on-farm management strategies which seek {{to reduce the risk of}} P transfer from agricultural land to receiving water bodies. Consequently the aim of this research programme was to identify management strategies to reduce P loss in runoff from grassland, with five field studies undertaken. These studies involved measuring P concentrations in runoff following the application of rainfall to hydrologically isolated plots. Experiment 1 examined the impact of early season grazing on soil-derived P losses to runoff while Experiments 2 - 5 examined different management factors affecting slurry associated P losses in runoff. These included investigating alternative slurry application methods, the timing of slurry application, the role of sward cover at slurry application, and the contribution of anaerobically digested slurry to P losses in runoff. The results from these studies highlight a number of on-farm mitigation strategies than reduce the magnitude of P loss in runoff. For example, limiting the duration of individual grazing bouts can be effective at reducing P losses in runoff while, the use of the trailing shoe slurry spreading technique, particularly at times of wetter soil and at higher herbage covers can significantly reduce P losses in runoff, relative to traditional <b>splashplate</b> spreading techniques.

40|$|Slurry {{application}} with {{methods such as}} {{trailing shoe}} (TS) results in reduced emissions of ammonia (NH 3) compared with broadcast application using <b>splashplate</b> (SP). Timing the application during cool and wet weather conditions also contributes to low NH 3 emissions. From this perspective, we investigated whether reduced NH 3 emissions due to improved slurry application method and timing results {{in an increase in}} the nitrogen (N) fertilizer replacement value (NFRV). The effects of application timing (June vs. April) and application method (TS vs. SP) on the apparent N recovery (ANR) and NFRV from cattle slurry applied to grassland were examined on three sites over 3 yr in randomized block experiments. The NFRV was calculated using two methods: (i) NFRVN based on the ANR of slurry N relative to mineral N fertilizer; and (ii) NFRVDM based on DM yield. The TS method increased the ANR, NFRVN, and NFRVDM compared with SP in the 40 - to 50 -d period following slurry application by 0. 09, 0. 10, and 0. 10 kg kg(- 1), respectively. These values were reduced to 0. 07, 0. 06, and 0. 05 kg kg(- 1), respectively, when residual harvests {{during the rest of the}} year were included. The highest NFRVDM for the first harvest period was with application in April using TS (0. 30 kg kg(- 1)), while application in June with SP had the lowest (0. 12 kg kg(- 1)). The highest NFRVDM for the cumulative harvest period was with application in April using TS (0. 38 kg kg(- 1)), while application in June with SP had the lowest (0. 17 kg kg(- 1)). Improved management of application method, by using TS instead of SP, and timing, by applying slurry in April rather than June, off er potential to increase the NFRVDM of cattle slurry applied to grassland...|$|E
