40|$|The {{behavioral}} {{effects of}} haloperidol (0. 04 to 0. 16 mg/kg) and nonparalytic doses of decamethonium (0. 2 to 0. 8 mg/kg) were studied with operant methods that permitted {{the measurement of}} response rate, peak force of response, duration of response, and duration of the rat's <b>head</b> <b>entry</b> into the reinforcement dipper well. Type of operant response topography (forelimb press or forelimb grasp-and-pull) and peak force (low or high) required for reinforcement delivery were independent variables. The low-force, press-topography condition yielded qualitatively different profiles for the two drugs. Haloperidol increased peak force and duration of operant response, increased maximum <b>head</b> <b>entry</b> duration, and temporally dissociated forelimb and <b>head</b> <b>entry</b> behavior. Decamethonium decreased force and duration of operant response, did not appreciably affect maximum <b>head</b> <b>entry</b> duration, and did not influence the normal temporal coupling of forelimb and <b>head</b> <b>entry</b> responses. The haloperidol effects were seen as reflections of pseudo-Parkinsonism, not muscle weakness, which {{appeared to be the}} primary source of decamethonium's behavioral effects...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: A {{computational}} {{system was}} developed for this paper in the C++ programming language, to create a 125 I radioactive seed <b>entry</b> <b>file,</b> based on the positioning of a virtual grid (template) in voxel geometries, {{with the purpose of}} performing prostate cancer treatment simulations using the MCNPX code. Methods: The system is fed with information from the planning system with regard to each seed’s location and its depth, and an <b>entry</b> <b>file</b> is automatically created with all the cards (instructions) for each seed regarding their cell blocks and surfaces spread out spatially in the 3 D environment. The system provides with precision a reproduction of the clinical scenario for the MCNPX code’s simulation environment, thereby allowing the technique’s in-depth study. Results and Conclusion: The preliminary results from this study showed that the lateral penumbra of uniform scanning proton beams was less sensitive In order to validate the computational system, an <b>entry</b> <b>file</b> was created with 88 125 I seeds that were inserted in the phantom’s MAX 06 prostate region with initial activity determined for the seeds at the 0. 27 mCi value. Isodose curves were obtained in all the prostate slices in 5 mm steps in the 7 to 10 cm interval, totaling 7 slices. Variance reduction techniques were applied in order to optimize computational time and the reduction of uncertainties such as photon and electron energy interruptions in 4 keV and forced collisions regarding cells of interest. Through the acquisition of isodose curves, the results obtained show that hot spots have values above 300 Gy, as anticipated in literature, stressing the importance of the sources’ correct positioning, in which the computational system developed provides, in order not to release excessive doses in adjacent risk organs. The 144 Gy prescription curve showed in the validation process that it covers perfectly {{a large percentage of the}} volume, at the same time that it demonstrates a large decline for short distances.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{cross-coupled}} stimuli on the semicircular canals are {{shown to be}} influenced by the position of the <b>subject's</b> <b>head</b> with respect to gravity and the axis of rotation, but not by the <b>subject's</b> <b>head</b> position relative to the trunk. Seventeen healthy <b>subjects</b> made <b>head</b> yaw movements out of the horizontal plane while lying on a horizontal platform (MIT short radius centrifuge) rotating at 23 rpm about an earth-vertical axis. The subjects reported the magnitude and duration of the illusory pitch or roll sensations elicited by the cross-coupled rotational stimuli acting on the semicircular canals. The results suggest an influence of head position relative to gravity. The magnitude estimation is higher and the sensation decays more slowly when the head's final position is toward nose-up (gravity in the <b>subject's</b> <b>head</b> x-z-plane) compared to when the head is turned toward the side (gravity in the <b>subject's</b> <b>head</b> y-z-plane).
