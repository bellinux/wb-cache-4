5|$|The video {{starts with}} a woman exiting the taxi {{and going to the}} Los Angeles Union Station. A man exits a car and follows her. Wade then plays the first verse and first chorus in the waiting area of the L. A. Union Station. As the band plays the second verse, they are shown playing at the rooftop with Iron Mountain clearly visible. When the chorus plays again, they are shown at the roof with lights from the {{buildings}} of Downtown Los Angeles at night. When Wade sings the bridge, he is {{on the roof of the}} Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood Boulevard. The man and the woman are also seen running in the boarding area of the Los Angeles Union Station. They later meet up and kiss in one of the boarding platforms of the station in front of a train which later <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>move.</b> The video ends with the band sitting down in the waiting hall.|$|E

Since the first footfall of the canter is the outside hind leg, the rider times the aids {{to ask for the}} canter when the outside hind leg is engaged (i.e. under the body). So, at the trot the rider would ask when the inside front leg touches the ground (its shoulder will be forward). At the walk, the rider will ask when the outside shoulder <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> back.|$|E

25|$|At a young age, {{children}} can already utilize {{their knowledge of}} different social categories to form stereotypes about what they understand about men and women. Interaction with peer groups will often shape people’s behavior to fit normative expectations. Children often group together with other children of the same-gender. Belonging in a group that shares the same gender identity will often endorse more gender appropriate traits. An {{example of this is}} the fact that girls have more expressive traits than boys. Research also show that children often engage in play with same-sex peers, and exclude others who are different from the norm. For example, children who want to join a group will only be allowed to engage in play if they are a same-gender peer who has had prior experience with the activity, or an opposite-gender peer who has not had prior experience. The desire to engage in play can influence a child to behave like to their peers. In later life, as children <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> away from their parents, the role of friendship becomes much more influential.|$|E

2500|$|For simple {{software}}, {{when the}} mouse <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>move,</b> the software will {{count the number}} of [...] "counts" [...] or [...] "mickeys" [...] received from the mouse and will move the cursor across the screen by that number of pixels (or multiplied by a rate factor, typically less than 1). The cursor will move slowly on the screen, with good precision. When the movement of the mouse passes the value set for some threshold, the software will start to move the cursor faster, with a greater rate factor. Usually, the user can set the value of the second rate factor by changing the [...] "acceleration" [...] setting.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{there have}} been many {{attempts}} to corner markets by massive purchases in everything from tin to cattle, to date very few of these attempts have ever succeeded; instead, most of these attempted corners have tended to break themselves spontaneously. Indeed, as long ago as 1923, Edwin Lefèvre wrote, [...] "very few of the great corners were profitable to the engineers of them." [...] A cornerer can become vulnerable due {{to the size of the}} position, especially if the attempt becomes widely known. If the rest of the market senses weakness, it may resist any attempt to artificially drive the market any further by actively taking opposing positions. If the price <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> against the cornerer, any attempt by the cornerer to sell would likely cause the price to drop substantially. In such a situation, many other parties could profit from the cornerer's need to unwind the position.|$|E

2500|$|The {{principle}} can {{be shown}} by an early special purpose seismometer. This consisted of a large stationary pendulum, with a stylus on the bottom. [...] As the earth <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>move,</b> the heavy mass of the pendulum has the inertia to stay still in the non-earth frame of reference. [...] The {{result is that the}} stylus scratches a pattern corresponding with the Earth's movement. This type of strong motion seismometer recorded upon a smoked glass (glass with carbon soot). While not sensitive enough to detect distant earthquakes, this instrument could indicate the direction of the pressure waves and thus help find the epicenter of a local earthquake – such instruments were useful in the analysis of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Further re-analysis was performed in the 1980s using these early recordings, enabling a more precise determination of the initial fault break location in Marin county and its subsequent progression, mostly to the south.|$|E
2500|$|Follow {{through and}} {{overlapping}} {{action is a}} general heading for two closely related techniques which help to render movement more realistically, and help {{to give the impression}} that characters follow the laws of physics, including the principle of inertia. [...] "Follow through" [...] means that loosely tied parts of a body should continue moving after the character has stopped and the parts should keep moving beyond the point where the character stopped only to be subsequently [...] "pulled back" [...] towards the center of mass and/or exhibiting various degrees of oscillation damping. [...] "Overlapping action" [...] is the tendency for parts of the body to move at different rates (an arm will move on different timing of the head and so on). A third, related technique is [...] "drag", where a character <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> and parts of him take a few frames to catch up. These parts can be inanimate objects like clothing or the antenna on a car, or parts of the body, such as arms or hair. On the human body, the torso is the core, with arms, legs, head and hair appendices that normally follow the torso's movement. Body parts with much tissue, such as large stomachs and breasts, or the loose skin on a dog, are more prone to independent movement than bonier body parts. Again, exaggerated use of the technique can produce a comical effect, while more realistic animation must time the actions exactly, to produce a convincing result.|$|E
2500|$|Qualifications, {{commonly}} known as [...] "Quals," [...] is the first {{and one of the}} most important series events. Qualifications is a four lap race around the track to see which team can get the fastest cumulative time. These times determine if a team qualifies to race in Little 5 and if so, then where in the field of the top 33 teams they will be placed. Each team is given three attempts to qualify. The reason for this is in case a team faults an exchange, then they still have two more chances to qualify. The way that a team can fault an exchange is if one of its members falls and takes the bike down with her, or the team does not perform the exchange in the given distance, which is marked by white lines on the track. Or, in the case of a bike-to-bike exchange, if the second rider <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> before she is tagged or if the first rider does not stop the bike before the last white line. Teams can use as many as four riders or as few as two riders. But whatever amount of riders a team uses to qualify is the least amount of riders they can use for Little 5. Meaning that if a team qualifies with four people, then they must race with four people. But if they qualify using only three people, then they can use three or four people on the day of Little 5.|$|E

2500|$|This {{kinematic}} description makes {{a number}} of simplifying assumptions since it neglects forces. [...] For one, it assumes that the rolling resistance is zero. [...] A wheelset (not attached to a train or truck), is given a push forward on a straight and level track. [...] The wheelset starts coasting and never slows down {{since there are no}} forces (except downward forces on the wheelset to make it adhere to the track and not slip). [...] If initially the wheelset is centered on the railroad track then the effective diameters of each wheel are the same and the wheelset rolls down the track in a perfectly straight line forever. [...] But if the wheelset is a little off-center so that the effective diameters (or radii) are different, then the wheelset <b>starts</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> in a curve of Radius R (depending on these wheelset radii, etc.; to be derived later on). [...] The problem is to use kinematic reasoning to find the trajectory of the wheelset, or more precisely, the trajectory of the center of the wheelset projected vertically on the roadbed {{in the center of the}} track. [...] This is a trajectory on the plane of the level earth's surface and plotted on an x-y graphical plot where x is the distance along the railroad and y is the [...] "tracking error", the deviation of the center of the wheelset from the straight line of the railway running down the center of the track (midway between the two rails).|$|E
