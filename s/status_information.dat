500|$|Halo 4 is {{a shooter}} {{game in which}} players {{predominantly}} experience gameplay from a first-person perspective; the game perspective switches to third-person when using certain weapons, abilities and vehicles. [...] The player's head-up display (HUD) shows real-time information on the player character's armor system, such as shield <b>status,</b> <b>information</b> on current weapons and abilities, and waypoints for goals and objectives. The HUD also has a motion tracker that detects allies, enemies, and vehicles within a certain radius of the player. The game sees {{the return of the}} alien species who were formerly members of the Covenant as foes, and introduces a new type of enemy called the Prometheans, which are Forerunner A.I constructs. There are three types of Prometheans: Knights serve as leaders of the group and are considered the deadliest of the Promethean forces; Crawlers are a weaker class that often attack in packs; and Watchers offer support and have the ability to shield or revive Promethean allies.|$|E

[...] Since the clients only send information to a specific monitoring server, its creators claim it is more secure than SNMP-based protocols which poll clients for information.

2500|$|The recent {{decision}} {{to join the}} Brady and Brownwood MOAs will provide additional maneuver airspace for Air Intercept Control/Air Combat Maneuvering (AIC/ACM) training. When scheduled concurrently, these areas enable numerous aircraft from several units to participate in joint fighter/bomber training exercises. Brownwood MOA {{is the subject of}} an innovative test to improve the dissemination of SUA <b>status</b> <b>information</b> to non-participating aircraft. This test, conducted to address action items in meeting Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Free Flight planning commitments, will use a combination of recently deployed airspace scheduling and reporting systems, including the FAA's Special-Use Airspace Management System (SAMS) and the Department of Defense Military Airspace Management System (MAMS). The intent of the trial is to provide more accurate [...] "near real-time" [...] area status via the internet to civilian users, especially to regional air carriers particularly affected by required rerouting around Brownwood MOA. Should the test and the technology prove successful and cost-effective, the result could address long-standing civilian dissatisfaction with the quality and timeliness of FAA-distributed special use airspace <b>status</b> <b>information.</b> In particular, such functionality may be appropriate for incorporation into the next generation of Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) modernization equipment.|$|E

2500|$|During the Mitigation phase, DoD {{critical}} asset owners, DoD installations, and Sector Chief Infrastructure Assurance Officers, or CIAOs, {{work with the}} National Military Command Center (NMCC) and the Joint Task Force-Computer Network Operations (JTF-CNO) to develop, train for, and exercise mitigation responses for various scenarios.

They also provide mitigation <b>status</b> <b>information</b> to the NMCC and JTF-CNO. The NMCC monitors for consequences from an event within one Defense Infrastructure sector that are significant enough to affect other sectors. For events that cross two or more sectors, the NMCC advises on the prioritization and coordination of mitigation actions. When event threats or consequences continue to escalate, the NMCC directs mitigation actions by sector to ensure a coordinated response across the DoD. The NMCC and the JTF-CNO keep the National Infrastructure Protection Center, or NIPC, apprised of any significant mitigation activities.|$|E
