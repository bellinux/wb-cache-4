40|$|Background: Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} is {{a common}} disease worldwide. The disease {{is described as a}} chronic inflammation that afflicts mainly the joints, the tendrons and the synovial joint. The inflammation breaks down cartilage, ligaments and bone. When the patient gets the diagnosis he/she frequently reacts with chock, denial or/and dissociation. Active <b>support</b> from the <b>nurse</b> <b>can</b> have an important impact on the patient in accepting and processing that he/she suffers from disease. The <b>nurse</b> <b>support</b> <b>can</b> be of instrumental, emotional and informative character. The instrumental support means access to people who can give practical help. The emotional support means access to close and confidential personal relationships. The informative support is when someone gets information to solve a task or handle a situation. Aim: To examine how adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis perception the <b>nurse</b> <b>support.</b> Method: This empiric study was carried through by inquiries presented to adult patients with the diagnosis rheumatoid arthritis. The participant of the study were registered patients at two different rheumatoid arthritis clinics. Results: 41 patients, 11 men and 30 women participated. The result showed that most of the participants felt that they had received <b>support</b> from the <b>nurse</b> and that all the different supports, instrumental, emotional and informative was to there satisfaction. Conclusion: Different factors {{have an effect on the}} patients perceptions of the nurse- support. These factors must be taken in consideration in order to develop the caretaking of the patient. Development can be made by continuous follow-ups. It is important that the patient becomes more conscious, more competent and more involved in order to easier cope with the disease.

40|$|Mental {{health policy}} {{includes}} a clear expectation that consumers {{will participate in}} all aspects of the design and delivery of mental health services. This edict has led to employment roles for people with lived experience of significant mental health challenges and service use. Despite the proliferation of these roles, research into factors impacting their success or otherwise is limited. This paper presents findings from a grounded theory study investigating the experiences of Lived Experience Practitioners {{in the context of their}} employment. In-depth interviews were conducted with 13 Lived Experience Practitioners. Risk was identified as a core category, and included sub-categories: vulnerability, &# 039;out and proud&# 039;, fear to disclose, and self-care. Essentially participants described the unique vulnerabilities of their mental health challenges being known, and while there were many positives about disclosing there was also apprehension about personal information being so publically known. Self-care techniques were important mediators against these identified risks. The success of lived experience roles requires <b>support</b> and <b>nurses</b> <b>can</b> play an important role, given the size of the nursing workforce in mental health, the close relationships nurses enjoy with consumers and the contribution they have made to the development of lived experience roles within academia...|$|R
40|$|Aim The aim of {{this study}} was to explore how <b>nurses</b> <b>can</b> <b>support</b> {{patients}} who are crying in a palliative home care context. BACKGROUND: In palliative care the nurse has a central role in the team whose duty it is to create a sense of security and trust, as well as to give comfort and support the patients. The nurse's responsibility is to identify different needs of the patients for support and develop a relationship with them. Patients may express their pain, anxiety, fear and suffering by crying. No studies have been found which focus on how <b>nurses</b> <b>can</b> <b>support</b> patients who are crying in different ways and crying for different reasons. METHODS: A qualitative explorative study was performed. Semi-structured interviews were held with eight nurses aged 32 - 63 years (Median 40) working in Swedish palliative home care. The data were analysed using Qualitative Content analysis. Findings It was reported that the nurse should meet and confirm the patient during different types of crying episodes and should also be able to alternate between being close and physically touching the in such close contact with the patients, the <b>nurse</b> <b>can</b> provide emotional <b>support</b> by showing empathy, merely being present and letting the patients cry as much as they want. When the crying finally stops, the <b>nurse</b> <b>can</b> <b>support</b> the person by speaking with them, showing sensitivity, humility and respect for the patient's wishes. A few examples of the patients' need for information or practical <b>support</b> emerged. The <b>nurse</b> <b>can</b> emotionally <b>support</b> the person who is crying by just being present, confirming, showing empathy, offering a chance to talk and showing respect for their individual needs and the different ways they may cry...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{current study}} was {{conducted}} to compare the opinions of mothers and nurses on the importance and availability of <b>nursing</b> <b>support</b> for parents with premature infants hospitalized in NICU. There is no overall picture of the <b>nursing</b> <b>support</b> for parents with hospitalized premature infants in Iran. Nurses, providing care in NICU, must view parent as an essential partner in care. But what is the situation? Assessing the viewpoints of both parents and nurses regarding the importance and availability of <b>nursing</b> <b>support</b> <b>can</b> elucidate this situation. Methods: A comparative descriptive design was used. The population consisted of all mothers with hospitalized premature newborns in NICU (n= 300) and all NICU nurses (n= 32) in three teaching hospitals in Tabriz (Iran), in 2007. Data was collected through the NPST questionnaire. Data analysis was done with SPSS. Findings: Mann-Whitney test showed that there were significant differences between nurses and mothers on four subscales of <b>nursing</b> <b>support.</b> Generally, mothers scored every subscale lower than nurses who cared for them and their children. On the other hand, it could be said that NICU nurses claimed more importance for the subscales and rated the provided support higher in comparison with mothers who did not think so. Conclusion: The opinions of the nurses and mothers toward the availability and importance of the <b>nursing</b> <b>supports</b> in NICU were different. This study provides nurses with concrete information in order to better understand parents’ need for support and try to meet their expectations, resulting in improved nursing care in neonatal intensive care units...|$|R
40|$|Background: Increases in ageing, {{chronic illness}} and complex co-morbidities in the Australian {{population}} are adding {{pressure to the}} primary care nursing workforce. Initiatives {{to attract and retain}} nurses are needed to establish a sustainable and skilled future primary care nursing workforce. We implemented a transition to professional practice program in general practice settings for graduate nurses and evaluated graduate nurse competency, the graduate nurse experience and program satisfaction. This study aimed to determine whether a transition to professional practice program implemented in the general practice setting led to competent practice nurses in their first year post-graduation. Methods: A longitudinal, exploratory mixed-methods design was used to assess the pilot study. Data were collected at three times points (3, 6, 12 months) with complete data sets from graduate nurses (n = 4) and preceptors (n = 7). We assessed perceptions of the graduates’ nursing competency and confidence, satisfaction with the preceptor/graduate relationship, and experiences and satisfaction with the program. Graduate nurse competency was assessed using the National Competency Standards for Nurses in General Practice. Semi-structured interviews with participants at Time 3 sought information about barriers, enablers, and the perceived impact of the program. Results: Graduate nurses were found to be competent within their first year of clinical practice. Program perceptions from graduate nurses and preceptors were positive and the relationship between the graduate nurse and preceptor was key to this development. Conclusions: With appropriate <b>support</b> registered <b>nurses</b> <b>can</b> transition directly into primary care and are competent in their first year post-graduation.

40|$|The {{loss of a}} {{loved one}} affects family and friends but also the nurses and health care providers. At the time of death, nurses are at the bedside {{providing}} comfort and words of support. But who is there to <b>support</b> the <b>nurses</b> when the patient dies? The objective of this research project is to identify positive coping mechanisms that <b>nurses</b> <b>can</b> use on a daily basis through an extensive analysis of the literature and individual nurse interviews. Unfortunately, patient death may be more common for nurses who work on Intensive Care Units (ICU) and Hospice agencies. With the daily requirements of this profession, nurses must cope following sudden and expected patient death. The literature review revealed several coping mechanisms that demonstrated to be effective in assisting nurses cope with the death of a patient. These coping mechanisms include: establishing a “curtain of protection”, increasing a nurse’s experience of providing care to dying patients, recognizing one’s attitudes toward death, and increasing education and knowledge related to the dying process. These methods were then supported with interviews conducted with two ICU and two Hospice nurses. Both specialties recognized the importance of fellow <b>nurse</b> <b>support</b> following a patient’s death. With education, on-site training, <b>support</b> from fellow <b>nurses,</b> and resources, nurses have been able to care for dying patients while maintaining their own physical and mental health.

50|$|Because a woman's torso usually grows {{during the}} pregnancy, her bra band size may grow {{one or two}} sizes. An average of 80% of women wear the wrong bra size, and mothers who are {{preparing}} to <b>nurse</b> <b>can</b> benefit from a professional bra fitting from a lactation consultant. Women should choose nursing bras with strong side and undercup support and an extra-wide back for optimal <b>support.</b> <b>Nursing</b> bras usually have up to four rows of hooks in the rear closure to allow the woman to adjust her band size to a limited extent. However, because a woman's milk supply continually changes, her breasts will also change size during each day. Experts recommend a soft-cup bra made of a blend of cotton and Lycra with cups that stretch to accommodate changes in breast size. Most women buy two or more nursing bras so they can alternate between them.

40|$|AIM: To {{describe}} {{the experiences of}} 14 clinical nursing leaders introducing a knowledge translation (KT) project into one metropolitan acute care hospital in South Australia. The study also explored team members’ and service managers’ experiences. BACKGROUND: KT strategies assume that local (nursing) clinical leaders have the capacity and capability to champion innovation combining positional leadership roles (ward leader) with a project lead role. There is limited evidence to support these assumptions. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews of clinical nursing leaders and managers were undertaken at month 4 and 12 of the project. Data were also collected from the interdisciplinary team members (n = 28). RESULTS: Clinical nursing leaders identified risks and anxieties associated with taking on an additional leadership role, whereas managers acknowledged the multiple pressures on the system {{and the need for}} local level innovation. Team members generally reported positive experiences. CONCLUSIONS: With <b>support,</b> clinical <b>nursing</b> leaders <b>can</b> effectively embrace KT project leadership roles that complement their positional leadership roles. Clinical nursing leaders’ experiences differed from nursing and medical managers’ experiences. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Managers need to be more attuned to the personal risks local leaders experience, providing support for leaders to experiment and innovate.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Feeling {{safe in the}} {{intensive}} care unit is of great importance while recovering from critical illness. Moreover, feeling unsafe can result in distress. In order to meet the safety needs of intensive care patients as well as to stimulate their recovery and prevent distress, nurses must be aware of factors promoting patients' perception of feeling safe during an intensive care admission. To our knowledge, there is no synthesis of these factors available as yet. OBJECTIVE: To systematically describe the factors that promote patients' perception of feeling safe in an intensive care unit. DESIGN: A systematic review of qualitative and quantitative studies. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO were searched up to March 2012. REVIEW METHODS: Methodological quality was assessed by two authors using the QualSyst tool. Data from the included studies were extracted into a customised data extraction form. RESULTS: The initial search resulted in 1326 records. Ultimately, eleven studies were relevant to the research question and included in the review. No studies needed to be excluded because of low quality scores. Analysis of the factors in these studies resulted in four overarching themes that promote intensive care patients' perception of feeling safe. These themes were: nursing care, patients' issues, relatives, and technological <b>support.</b> <b>Nursing</b> care was described most frequently as an important factor promoting patients' feeling of safety in an intensive care unit. Relatives were the link between intensive care patients and staff. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Nurses</b> <b>can</b> increase the perception of feeling safe in critically ill patients by taking into account the promoting factors described in this review.

40|$|Background and context: Implementation {{of current}} {{research}} in practice is challenging for ward-based nursing staff. However, university-based nursing academics {{are seen as}} the research experts and are perhaps well placed to <b>support</b> clinical <b>nursing</b> research. The problem lies with the divide between practice and academia; universities often use the clinical environment as the place to conduct research but this is often not translated effectively into practice. The development of a nursing professorial unit for acute and critical care was undertaken to meet this challenge. The unit’s key aim is to develop, mentor and <b>support</b> a <b>nursing</b> research culture that is wholly situated within and driven by {{the requirements of the}} clinical environment. Aim: The aim {{of this article is to}} offer some insights as to how staff set about engaging with and developing the nursing professorial unit to <b>support</b> <b>nursing</b> research in our local hospital.

Background Acute hospital nursing teams often include <b>nursing</b> <b>support</b> staff; little is known about what kinds of tasks these unregulated support workers do and how it affects the work tasks of their licensed/regulated team members. Design Cross-sectional analysis of nurse work sampling data. Methods Data collection took place between March–October 2013. The proportion of time spent on 25 work activities by <b>nursing</b> <b>support</b> staff and licensed/regulated nursing staff was compared. Logistic regression models estimated whether <b>nursing</b> <b>support</b> staff or licensed/regulated nurses were more likely to conduct direct and indirect patient care tasks and whether licensed/regulated nurses on units with <b>nursing</b> <b>support</b> staff were more likely to conduct direct or indirect tasks compared with those on units without <b>nursing</b> <b>support</b> workers. Results <b>Nursing</b> <b>support</b> staff spent the majority of their time engaged in direct care tasks, e. g. admission and assessment, hygiene and mobility.
