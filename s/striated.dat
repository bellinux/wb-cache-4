5|$|The muscle of the {{esophagus}} in many mammals is <b>striated</b> initially, but then becomes smooth muscle in the caudal third or so. In canines and ruminants, however, {{it is entirely}} <b>striated</b> to allow regurgitation to feed young (canines) or regurgitation to chew cud (ruminants). It is entirely smooth muscle in amphibians, reptiles and birds.|$|E
5|$|However, in 2005 Katja Seipel and Volker Schmid {{suggested}} that cnidarians and ctenophores are simplified descendants of triploblastic animals, since ctenophores and the medusa stage of some cnidarians have <b>striated</b> muscle, which in bilaterians {{arises from the}} mesoderm. They did not commit themselves on whether bilaterians evolved from early cnidarians or from the hypothesized triploblastic ancestors of cnidarians.|$|E
5|$|Lazzell's {{paintings}} {{demonstrated a}} rich and nuanced use of color. She preferred French watercolor pigments that, alongside {{the grain of the}} woodblocks, created embossed lines and <b>striated</b> patterns. Typically the woodblocks she created were made from cherry or basswood and she only pulled three or four prints from each woodblock. From 1916 to 1955, Lazzell created 138 woodblocks. Modern exhibitions of Lazzell's artworks have included the woodblocks themselves.|$|E
5|$|Muscle cells (myocytes) {{form the}} active {{contractile}} tissue of the body. Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types; smooth muscle, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. Smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility {{over a wide}} range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely <b>striated</b> muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and {{this is the type of}} muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions. In higher animals <b>striated</b> muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus, bladder, intestines, stomach, oesophagus, respiratory airways, and blood vessels. Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.|$|E
5|$|Slightly {{smaller than}} Earth's Moon, Europa is {{primarily}} made of silicate rock {{and has a}} water-ice crust and probably an iron–nickel core. It has a tenuous atmosphere composed primarily of oxygen. Its surface is <b>striated</b> by cracks and streaks, whereas craters are relatively rare. In addition to Earth-bound telescope observations, Europa has been examined by a succession of space probe flybys, the first occurring in the early 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{islands are}} frequented by marine mammals, {{such as the}} {{southern}} elephant seal and the South American fur seal, and various types of cetaceans; offshore islands house the rare <b>striated</b> caracara. The Falklands are also home to five different penguin species {{and a few of}} the largest albatross colonies on the planet. Endemic fish around the islands are primarily from the genus Galaxias. The Falklands are treeless and have a wind-resistant vegetation predominantly composed of a variety of dwarf shrubs.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle layer}} of the heart wall is the myocardium, which is the cardiac muscle – a layer of {{involuntary}} <b>striated</b> muscle tissue surrounded by a framework of collagen. The cardiac muscle pattern is elegant and complex, as the muscle cells swirl and spiral around the chambers of the heart, with the outer muscles forming a figure 8 pattern around the atria and around the bases of the great vessels, and inner muscles formining a figure 8 around the two ventricles and proceed toward the apex. This complex swirling pattern allows the heart to pump blood more effectively.|$|E
5|$|The panniculus carnosus is a {{layer of}} <b>striated</b> muscle deep to the panniculus adiposus. Although absent in hominoids, the panniculus carnosus is common in non-hominoid {{primates}} and non-primate mammals. In lower mammals {{the area of the}} panniculus carnosus can be extensive, almost covering the entire body {{in the case of the}} short-beaked echidna. Several human muscles are considered discrete muscles originating from the panniculus carnosus, and some researchers classify the axillary arch as a sporadic vestigial muscle of this type.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus {{comes in}} four {{distinct}} species; Cirrus castellanus, fibratus, spissatus, and uncinus; which are each {{divided into four}} varieties: intortus, vertebratus, radiatus, and duplicatus. Cirrus castellanus is a species that has cumuliform tops caused by high-altitude convection rising up from the main cloud body. Cirrus fibratus looks <b>striated</b> and {{is the most common}} cirrus species. Cirrus uncinus clouds are hooked and are the form that is usually called mare's tails. Of the varieties, Cirrus intortus has an extremely contorted shape, and cirrus radiatus has large, radial bands of cirrus clouds that stretch across the sky. Kelvin–Helmholtz waves are a form of cirrus intortus that has been twisted into loops by vertical wind shear.|$|E
5|$|The {{function}} of TnI is to control <b>striated</b> muscle contraction and relaxation. Troponin I interacts with all major regulatory proteins in the sarcomeric thin filaments of cardiac and skeletal muscles: troponin C, troponin T, tropomyosin and actin. When cytosolic Ca2+ is low, TnI binds the thin filament {{to block the}} myosin binding sites on actin. The rise of cytosolic Ca2+ results in binding to the N-terminal domain of troponin C and induces conformational changes in troponin C and the troponin complex, which releases the inhibition of myosin-actin interaction and activates myosin ATPase and cross bridge cycling to generate myosin power strokes and muscle contraction.|$|E
5|$|The main {{muscular system}} in {{bivalves}} is the posterior and anterior adductor muscles, although the anterior muscles {{may be reduced}} or even lost in some species. These strong muscles connect the two valves and contract to close the shell. They work {{in opposition to the}} ligament which tends to pull the valves apart. In sedentary or recumbent bivalves that lie on one valve, such as the oysters and scallops, the anterior adductor muscle has been lost and the posterior muscle is positioned centrally. In file shells that can swim by flapping their valves, a single, central adductor muscle occurs. These muscles are composed of two types of muscle fibres, <b>striated</b> muscle bundles for fast actions and smooth muscle bundles for maintaining a steady pull.|$|E
5|$|The muscular {{layer of}} the {{esophagus}} has two types of muscle. The upper third of the esophagus contains <b>striated</b> muscle, the lower third contains smooth muscle, and the middle third contains a mixture of both. Muscle is arranged in two layers: {{one in which the}} muscle fibers run longitudinal to the esophagus, and the other in which the fibers encircle the esophagus. These are separated by the myenteric plexus, a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the esophagus. The outermost {{layer of the}} esophagus is the adventitia in most of its length, with the abdominal part being covered in serosa. This makes it distinct from many other structures in the gastrointestinal tract that only have a serosa.|$|E
5|$|The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are {{typically}} fringed with tentilla ("little tentacles"), {{although a few}} genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches. The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and {{is attached to the}} head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain <b>striated</b> muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the <b>striated</b> muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type. Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state, but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle.|$|E
5|$|A {{diffraction}} grating constructed of layers of chitin and air {{gives rise to}} the iridescent colours of various butterfly wing scales {{as well as to the}} tail feathers of birds such as the peacock. Hooke and Newton were correct in their claim that the peacock's colours are created by interference, but the structures responsible, being close to the wavelength of light in scale (see micrographs), were smaller than the <b>striated</b> structures they could see with their light microscopes. Another way to produce a {{diffraction grating}} is with tree-shaped arrays of chitin, as in the wing scales of some of the brilliantly coloured tropical Morpho butterflies (see drawing). Yet another variant exists in Parotia lawesii, Lawes's parotia, a bird of paradise. The barbules of the feathers of its brightly coloured breast patch are V-shaped, creating thin-film microstructures that strongly reflect two different colours, bright blue-green and orange-yellow. When the bird moves the colour switches sharply between these two colours, rather than drifting iridescently. During courtship, the male bird systematically makes small movements to attract females, so the structures must have evolved through sexual selection.|$|E
5|$|Self-incompatible, Acacia pycnantha cannot {{fertilise}} {{itself and}} requires cross-pollination between plants to set seed. Birds facilitate this and field experiments keeping birds away from flowers greatly reduces seed production. Nectaries {{are located on}} phyllodes; those near open flowers become active, producing nectar that birds feed upon just before or during flowering. While feeding, birds brush against the flower heads and dislodge pollen and often visit multiple trees. Several species of honeyeater, including the white-naped, yellow-faced, New Holland, and occasionally white-plumed and crescent honeyeaters, and Eastern spinebills have been observed foraging. Other bird species include the silvereye, <b>striated,</b> buff-rumped and brown thornbills. As well as eating nectar, birds often pick off insects on the foliage. Honeybees, native bees, ants and flies also visit nectaries, but generally do not {{come into contact with}} the flowers during this activity. The presence of Acacia pycnantha is positively correlated with numbers of swift parrots overwintering in box–ironbark forest in central Victoria, though {{it is not clear whether}} the parrots are feeding on them or some other factor is at play.|$|E
5|$|The Delichon species {{typically}} feed {{higher in}} the air, and take smaller prey than other swallows. It is believed that this reduces inter-specific food competition, particularly with the barn swallow which shares much of the breeding and wintering range of the martins. The insects eaten are mostly small flies, aphids and Hymenoptera such as winged ants. A wide range of other insects are caught, including Lepidoptera, beetles and lacewings. The Asian house martin appears to occasionally take terrestrial springtails and larvae and the common house martin also sometimes feeds on the ground. These martins are gregarious, feeding in flocks often with other aerial predators like swifts, or other hirundines such as the barn or <b>striated</b> swallows. In the case of at least the common house martin, the start of egg laying appears {{to be linked to}} the appearance of large numbers of flying aphids, which provide a stable and abundant food supply.|$|E
5|$|The {{esophagus}} is {{innervated by}} the vagus nerve and the cervical and thoracic sympathetic trunk. The vagus nerve has a parasympathetic function, supplying {{the muscles of}} the esophagus and stimulating glandular contraction. Two sets of nerve fibers travel in the vagus nerve to supply the muscles. The upper <b>striated</b> muscle, and upper esophageal sphincter, are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus, whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus. The vagus nerve plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis. The sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function. It may enhance the function of the vagus nerve, increasing peristalsis and glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. In addition, sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction. Sensation along the esophagus is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk.|$|E
5|$|Magpies {{have a long}} {{breeding}} season which varies {{in different parts of}} the country; in northern parts of Australia they will breed between June and September, but not commence until August or September in cooler regions, and may continue until January in some alpine areas. The nest is a bowl-shaped structure made of sticks and lined with softer material such as grass and bark. Near human habitation, synthetic material may be incorporated. Nests are built exclusively by females and generally placed high up in a tree fork, often in an exposed position. The trees used are most commonly eucalypts, although a variety of other native trees as well as introduced pine, Crataegus, and elm have been recorded. Other bird species, such as the yellow-rumped thornbill (Acanthiza chrysorrhoa), willie wagtail (Rhipidura leucophrys), southern whiteface (Aphelocephala leucopsis), and (less commonly) noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala), often nest in the same tree as the magpie. The first two species may even locate their nest directly beneath a magpie nest, while the diminutive <b>striated</b> pardalote (Pardalotus striatus) has been known to make a burrow for breeding into the base of the magpie nest itself. These incursions are all tolerated by the magpies. The channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae) is a notable brood parasite in eastern Australia; magpies will raise cuckoo young, which eventually outcompete the magpie nestlings.|$|E
25|$|Tetanus affects {{skeletal}} muscle, {{a type of}} <b>striated</b> muscle used in voluntary movement. The {{other type}} of <b>striated</b> muscle, cardiac, or heart muscle, cannot be tetanized because of its intrinsic electrical properties.|$|E
25|$|The {{muscular system}} of insects ranges {{from a few}} hundred muscles to a few thousand. Unlike {{vertebrates}} that have both smooth and <b>striated</b> muscles, insects have only <b>striated</b> muscles. Muscle cells are amassed into muscle fibers {{and then into the}} functional unit, the muscle. Muscles are attached to the body wall, with attachment fibers running through the cuticle and to the epicuticle, where they can move different parts of the body including appendages such as wings.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell is}} horny brown, weakly <b>striated.</b> The cervix is more {{prominently}} <b>striated.</b> The shell has 11-13 whorls with white suture. The cervix is with weak basal keel. The dorsal keel is very weak if present. The aperture is not detached. The parietalis and columellaris is prominent, lunula dorsolateral, basalis very short. There is no platal callus and no frontal upper palatalis. Subcolumellaris {{is visible in}} a perpendicular view. Clausilium plate is usually with edge at the outer margin.|$|E
25|$|The {{resident}} birds {{seen here}} include little cormorant, spot-billed pelican, little grebe, common kingfisher, pied kingfisher, white-breasted kingfisher, little green or <b>striated</b> heron, pond heron and red-wattled lapwing.|$|E
25|$|Pancuronium bromide: nondepolarizing muscle relaxant, {{which causes}} complete, fast, and {{sustained}} paralysis of the skeletal <b>striated</b> muscles, including the diaphragm {{and the rest}} of the respiratory muscles; this would eventually cause death by asphyxiation.|$|E
25|$|The {{green heron}} (Butorides virescens) and its sister species the <b>striated</b> heron (Butorides striata) have been {{recorded}} using food (bread crusts), insects, leaves, and other small objects as bait to attract fish, which they then capture and eat.|$|E
25|$|Use of bait: Several {{species of}} bird, {{including}} herons {{such as the}} <b>striated</b> heron (Butorides striatus), will place bread in water to attract fish. Whether this is tool use is disputed because the bread is not manipulated or held by the bird.|$|E
25|$|It {{is found}} to {{interact}} with 36 species including <b>Striated</b> surgeonfish, Acanthurus nigrofuscus, parrotfish and its cousin bluestreak cleaner wrasse. Like other cleaners, Labroides bicolor will dance {{as a form of}} communication and may also dance to reduce client aggression.|$|E
25|$|In {{the duct}} system, the lumina are formed by {{intercalated}} ducts, {{which in turn}} join to form <b>striated</b> ducts. These drain into ducts situated between the lobes of the gland (called interlobar ducts or secretory ducts). These are found on most major and minor glands (exception may be the sublingual gland).|$|E
25|$|The {{workers have}} reddish to {{brownish}} yellow body colour with the head, antennal club and dorsal surface being darker. The petiole nodes and femora are frequently infuscate. They {{have a total}} of 11 segments in antennae. The head is longitudinally <b>striated,</b> and smooth and the average length is usually 3.7-4.5mm.|$|E
25|$|May {{be used to}} {{evaluate}} incontinence, but there is disagreement about what relevance the results may show, as rarely do they mandate a change of surgical plan. There may be denervation of <b>striated</b> musculature on the electromyogram. Increased nerve conduction periods (nerve damage), this may be significant in predicting post-operative incontinence.|$|E
25|$|<b>Striated</b> {{muscle is}} the most {{commonly}} found natural diffraction grating and, this has helped physiologists in determining the structure of such muscle. Aside from this, the chemical structure of crystals {{can be thought of}} as diffraction gratings for types of electromagnetic radiation other than visible light, this is the basis for techniques such as X-ray crystallography.|$|E
25|$|Other nesting native birds include red-tailed tropicbirds (Phaethon rubricauda), wedge-tailed shearwaters (Puffinus pacificus), Audubon's shearwater (Puffinus iherminierii), black-naped terns (Sterna sumatrana), white (or fairy) terns (Gygis alba), <b>striated</b> herons (Butorides striatus), and white-breasted waterhens (Amaurornis phoenicurus). The 680-hectare Barton Point Nature Reserve was {{identified}} as an Important Bird Area for its large breeding colony of red-footed boobies.|$|E
25|$|Eggs are oval spheroids with {{flattened}} bases, about 0.5mm high. They are ribbed (longitudinally, i.e. {{from top}} to bottom) and <b>striated</b> (transversely, i.e. around the egg). Pale cream when laid, eggs darken to pale yellow within two days, and then dark grey {{a few days before}} hatching. Eggs mature in two to three weeks.|$|E
25|$|Cadair Idris or Cader Idris is a {{mountain}} in Gwynedd, Wales, which {{lies at the}} southern end of the Snowdonia National Park near the town of Dolgellau. The peak, which is one of the most popular in Wales for walkers and hikers, is composed largely of Ordovician igneous rocks, with classic glacial erosion features such as cwms, moraines, <b>striated</b> rocks, and roches moutonnées.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell is}} semi-globose, thin, horny, olivaceous, {{longitudinally}} finely <b>striated.</b> The spire is very short, obtuse. The apex is rather eroded. The last whorl is ventricose. The aperture {{is large and}} semi-ovate. The inner-lip is posteriorly ascending on the body whorl. The columella is straight, excavated, and with a curved, elevated, external ridge continued in front into the outer lip which is simple and acute.|$|E
25|$|The {{shell is}} sinistral, subglobose, subdiscoidal, hyaline and very thin. The spire is {{depressed}} {{but it can}} be considered rather high in comparison of other Limacina species. The shell has 5-6 transversally <b>striated</b> whorls. The suture is distinct. The last whorl is large and with very obscure keel next to its umbilicus. The shell has a wide umbilicus. The aperture is higher than it is wide.|$|E
25|$|The Bronze Age, {{which in}} Ireland is dated from 2200–600 BC, also left its {{mark on the}} Dublin region. A variety of bronze and gold {{artifacts}} which have been discovered {{in the vicinity of}} the modern city – among them cauldrons, side-blown horns, lock rings, sleeve fasteners, <b>striated</b> rings, hair rings and penannular bracelets – indicate a continuous or intermittent settlement of the area.|$|E
