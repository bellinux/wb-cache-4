5|$|A modern {{light rail}} system was {{proposed}} by a newly formed regional transit authority (RTA) in 1995, including a line running on Rainier Avenue between Downtown <b>Seattle</b> <b>and</b> Seattle–Tacoma International Airport that stopped in Columbia City. After the $6.7 billion proposal was rejected by voters in March 1995, the RTA considered building a shorter elevated line on Rainier Avenue, including an option beginning at Columbia City and ending in the University District. In November 1996, a condensed $3.9 billion regional transit plan was approved by voters, including a light rail line between <b>Seattle</b> <b>and</b> Sea-Tac Airport that ran through the Rainier Valley, with an elevated station on Rainier Avenue South at South Edmunds Street in Columbia City.|$|E

5|$|As {{production}} of the B-47 came to an end, the Wichita factory was phased in for B-52D production, with Seattle responsible for 101 D-models and Wichita 69. Both plants continued to build the B-52E, with 42 built at <b>Seattle</b> <b>and</b> 58 at Wichita, and the B-52F (44 from <b>Seattle</b> <b>and</b> 45 from Wichita).

5|$|Everett Station {{is served}} by six daily Amtrak trains: four Cascades runs between <b>Seattle</b> <b>and</b> Vancouver, British Columbia, and two Empire Builder runs between <b>Seattle</b> <b>and</b> Chicago.

Train service to Everett is most often disrupted and canceled during the autumn and winter seasons because of landslides along the shoreline of the Puget Sound, where the BNSF mainline tracks run. During the 2012–2013 winter season, a record-high of 206 passenger trains between Everett and Seattle were canceled, prompting the Washington State Department of Transportation to begin a three-year landslide mitigation project in 2013 that will stabilize slopes above the railroad between <b>Seattle</b> <b>and</b> Everett.|$|E
