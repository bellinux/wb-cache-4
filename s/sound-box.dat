2500|$|Casals {{was born}} in El Vendrell, Catalonia, Spain. His father, Carles Casals i Ribes (1852–1908), was a parish organist and choirmaster. He gave Casals {{instruction}} in piano, songwriting, violin, and organ. He was also a very strict disciplinarian. When Casals was young his father would pull the piano out {{from the wall and}} have him and his brother, Artur, stand behind it and name the notes and the scales that his father was playing. At the age of four Casals could play the violin, piano and flute; at the age of six he played the violin well enough to perform a solo in public. His first encounter with a cello-like instrument was from witnessing a local traveling Catalan musician, who played a cello-strung broom handle. Upon request, his father built him a crude cello, using a gourd as a <b>sound-box.</b> When Casals was eleven, he first heard the real cello performed by a group of traveling musicians, and decided to dedicate himself to the instrument.|$|E
50|$|The endingidi {{is a type}} of bowed string {{instrument}} native to Uganda. The endingidi has one string, extending from the neck to a cylindrical <b>sound-box</b> or resonator made of wood or cow horn.A piece of hide is stretched {{over the top of the}} cylinder and is fixed to the <b>sound-box</b> with wooden pegs, thorny spines or nowadays also with metal nails. The hide used is usually that of the monitor lizard (varanus exanthematicus) but also of young goats and sheep or even of the python. The hide is soaked in water for a whole day before being stretched over the <b>sound-box.</b> The neck consists of a straight wooden stick inserted through the walls of the <b>sound-box</b> at about 2 to 3 cm from the top. At the top of the neck a hole is bored at 4 to 6 cm from the end into which a tuning pin is inserted vertically. The string is secured to this pin in such a way that the string can be wound round the pin in a similar way as with a violin. This allows the string to be tightened, so tuning the instrument. The string runs across the <b>sound-box</b> via a bridge and is fixed to the other end of the neck. The string is made of fibre or animal sinew, but nowadays it is more often of nylon. The arched bow consists of a thin flexible twig, to which a string is attached, usually of the same material as the string of the instrument itself. To give the bow more grip on the string of the instrument, resin is rubbed into the bow string. The resin is often attached to the side of the <b>sound-box</b> so the player can easily rub resin on the bow as he plays.|$|E

50|$|The Bordonua (Bordonúa) is a large, {{deep body}} (<b>sound-boxes</b> are usually 6 in deep) bass guitar which {{is native to}} Puerto Rico. They are made using several {{different}} shapes and sizes.|$|R
5000|$|Traditionally, jazz {{electric}} guitarists use an archtop with {{a relatively}} broad hollow <b>sound-box,</b> violin-style f-holes, a [...] "floating bridge", and a magnetic pickup. Solid body guitars, mass-produced since the early 1950s, are also used.|$|E
50|$|The guitar zither (also chord zither, fretless zither,, {{mandolin}} zither or harp zither) is {{a musical}} instrument consisting of a <b>sound-box</b> with two sets of unstopped strings. One set of strings is tuned to the diatonic, chromatic, or partially chromatic scale and the other set is tuned to make the various chords in the principal key of the melody strings.|$|E
50|$|The player {{holds the}} neck of the {{instrument}} {{in the palm of his}} left hand as he plays and so can damp the string with the second segment of his index finger, middle finger or ring finger. The hollow <b>sound-box</b> of the endingidi is held against the body and the bow is held in the right hand and is moved very quickly backwards and forwards across the string.|$|E
5000|$|Ernst Kaps {{obtained}} {{a number of}} patents on various interesting inventions. One of these included the [...] "resonator". This consisted of an additional <b>sound-box</b> with small sound ports(holes)drilled through the top. These were fixed to just below the tenor and treble bridges along the bridges profile. The idea of these were that this would create a larger vibrational mass and additional coincident partials (harmonics)—a complex endeavour to attempt a fuller and more colourful sound.|$|E
50|$|The {{instrument}} is rarely decorated; {{this is usually}} due to regional traditions. The <b>sound-box</b> is sometimes decorated with pyrographed designs, the neck with white and blue beads {{and the end of}} the neck with a brush of hair from the tail of a goat or a cow. The meat and bones are then removed from the tail, which is then stretched over the neck. As the skin dries, it shrinks and tightens around the neck.|$|E
50|$|Valdres and Vardal are {{the only}} areas where the langeleik has a living (and thus more developed) tradition, with more melodies available, {{especially}} of the more recent, more complex kind, made for arguably better instruments. The picture above is of a Valdres langeleik. It is also home of the valdres springar dance. Telemark is another distinct area of Norway, home of the Telemark springar. The Telemark langeleik is distinct from the Valdres kind in that the <b>sound-box</b> is thin and straight-walled whereas the Valdres-langeleik curves to a broader lower part, {{and it does not}} have a board at the bottom and thus is more dependent on a good table for amplification. Also the head looks all different.|$|E

5000|$|This {{consists}} of a device {{in the form of}} a harp shaped sound box contoured to the bridges which is screwed onto the soundboard. Ernst Kaps obtained a number of patents on various interesting inventions. These additional <b>sound-box</b> fixtures, with small sound ports(holes)drilled through the top, were attached to just below the tenor and treble bridges along the bridge profiles. The idea of these were that this would create 'a larger vibrational mass' and additional 'coincident partials(harmonics)'. A complex endeavour to attempt a fuller and more colourful sound. Ernst Kaps stated that [...] "Each resonant case maybe of a size and length to respond acoustically to the note of the strings passing through it. The resonant cases form in the aggregate what I term a “ sound-hood.” I am aware that sounding-boxes have been attached to different parts of a piano, such as to the frame or the sounding-board. In all such cases the vibration of the sounding board or case was depended upon to give vibrations to the boxes. In my improvement the air in each resonant case receives a vibration from the string itself when it is struck, thereby the resonant vibrations of the string are communicated directly to the air of the case, which responds thereto". As mentioned, [...] "this device served to give increased resonance to the thinner tones of the soprano and higher registers for a significant boost and timbre, while providing a more consistent and defined ratio between the sound levels" ...|$|E
40|$|When a {{stereophonic}} track is heard through headphones or over loudspeakers, {{the image of}} a virtual performance is created in the mind. This virtual performance, which exists exclusively on the record, can be conceptualised in terms of the ‘sound-box’ (Moore 1993), a four-dimensional virtual space within which sounds can be located through: lateral placement within the stereo field; foreground and background placement due to volume and distortion; height according to sound vibration frequency; and time. From the mid- 1960 s, the increasing shift from mono to stereo meant that producers and engineers had to contend with the notion and potential of a song’s sonic arrangement or mix, resulting in a disparity of sonic placement and a diverse range of <b>sound-box</b> configurations. By 1972, a normative positioning of sound sources within the <b>sound-box</b> was established, which we term the ‘diagonal mix’. This article focuses on the consolidation of this norm by means of a ‘taxonomy of mixes’ and the utilisation of visual representations which detail the <b>sound-box</b> configurations of a variety of pop/rock, easy listening and psychedelic tracks from 1966 to 1972...|$|E
40|$|Rather than reenacting {{every action}} they observe, preverbal infants adapt their {{imitative}} behavior. Although {{previous studies have}} revealed the capability of preverbal infants to imitate selectively, {{the question about the}} adaptability of this behavior on an individual level did not attract considerable scientific attention until now. In the current study, we investigated whether 14 -month-old infants flexibly alternate their imitative response in accordance with a model’s changing physical constraints in a body-part imitation paradigm. Participants were presented with two novel actions whereby a model illuminated a light-box and turned on a <b>sound-box,</b> either by using her forehead (head touch) or by sitting on the apparatus (sit-touch). Each participant observed these tasks in two conditions: once where the model’s hands were occupied and once where her hands were free while executing the head or sit-touch. Participants were more likely to reenact the observed novel behavior when the model had freely chosen to perform it than when she had to do so due to physical constraints. Not only did we replicate a number of previous findings, we show here that preverbal infants adapt their imitative behavior across conditions based on the physical constraints of the model. These results point towards the adaptable nature of imitative behavior also on an individual level. This ability might be one of the building blocks for children for learning their social group’s specific action repertoire...|$|E
40|$|The {{idea for}} the {{composition}} was to treat the piano as a giant <b>sound-box</b> {{and to get the}} effect of the whole instrument vibrating; and, to produce a meditative state, where the listener gradually gets drawn into the textures and starts imagining and hearing sounds out of the ‘aural mist’ that emanates from the inside of the piano. This was achieved by placing a loudspeaker inside the piano and playing back electroacoustic textures through the loudspeaker to generate sympathetic vibrations. The piano part is part derived from a transcription of the electronic feedback that accompanies the piano. The piece addresses a number of ongoing research questions that are central to my work. These include adapting methods that enable flexibility between a performer and sound on a fixed medium; using sound generated indeterminately through processes and improvisation to dictate structure; and blurring the boundary between perceived electronic and acoustic sound. The piece was composed for the Ukrainian pianist GéNIA (Chudinovich) and has been performed internationally, including at Lewis University, USA, 2002, and Illinois Central College, USA, 2002. Suite has also been performed in the UK at the Museum of Garden History, London, 2005, and Cargo, London, 2006. The piece was also featured at COMA Summer School, 2004. In 2006, the piece was re-worked for a CD publication on nonclassical records. In addition to the original composition, the CD also includes re-mixes/workings by a number of eminent electronic musicians: Tim Wright (Tubejerk/Germ), Derailer (John Matthias, David and Andy Prior), Max De Wardener, Vex’d, The EarlyMan and Gabriel Prokofiev. The piece has received numerous broadcasts including: BBC Radio 3, The Late Junction; BBC Radio 1, Mary Anne Hobbs Show; Resonance FM; Radio Sauvagine, Bordeaux, France; and Klassika Raadio, Estonia...|$|E
