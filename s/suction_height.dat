40|$|The {{transition}} of the {{laminar boundary layer}} into the turbulent state, which results in an increased drag, can be avoided by sucking of the boundary layer particles near the wall. The technically-interesting case of sucking the particles using individual slits is investigated for bodies of revolution in incompressible flow. The results of the variational calculations {{show that there is}} an optimum <b>suction</b> <b>height,</b> where the slot separations are maximum. Combined with favorable shaping of the body, it is possible to keep the boundary layer over bodies of revolution laminar at high Reynolds numbers using relatively few suction slits and small amounts of suction flow...|$|E
40|$|A static {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} a counterflow thrust vectoring nozzle concept was performed. The {{study was conducted in}} the NASA Langley Research Center Jet Exit Test Facility. Internal performance characteristics were defined over a nozzle pressure ratio (jet total to ambient) range of 3. 5 to 10. 0. The effects of suction collar geometry and <b>suction</b> slot <b>height</b> on nozzle performance were examined. In the counterflow concept, thrust vectoring is achieved by applying a vacuum to a slot adjacent to a primary jet that is shrouded by a suction collar. Two flow phenomena work to vector the primary jet depending upon the test conditions and configuration. In one case, the vacuum source creates a secondary reverse flowing stream near the primary jet. The shear layers between the two counterflowing streams mix and entrain mass from the surrounding fluid. The presence of the collar inhibits mass entrainment and the flow near the collar accelerates, causing a drop in pressure on the collar. The second case works similarly except that the vacuum is not powerful enough to create a counterflowing stream and instead a coflowing stream is present. The primary jet is vectored if suction is applied asymmetrically on the top or bottom of the jet...|$|R

THE INFLUENCE OF THE MAIN PROCESS VARIABLES AS <b>SUCTION,</b> BED <b>HEIGHT,</b> SINTER MIXTURE, LIME AND COKE ADDICTIONS, ON THE SINTER QUALITY AND OUTPUT HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED. SINTER WITH AN OPTIMUM REDUCTION DEGREE (60 %) HAS BEEN OBTAINED WITH A MIXTURE OF 50 % DUST, 25 % SLUDGE AND 25 % FINE ORE. THIS MIXTURE GAVE 18. 2 T /M 2. 24 H MAXIMUM SINTER OUTPUT FOR 12 CM BED HEIGHT AND 2 % LIME ADDITION. ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS OF THE PILOT PLANT TRIALS, SINTERING IS FEASIBLE WITHOUT ANY FUEL ADDITIONS.

40|$|Hydraulic turbine suction pipes at {{hydropower}} plants (HPPs) play {{an important}} role for providing high power indices of HPP operation. At the same time for channel type HPPs with vertical reactive hydraulic turbines curved large size suction tubes are used and this leads to great costs for their installation. That is why the significance of economic analysis for justification of the size of such suction pipes is underlined. Minimally possible sizes of curved pipes (height and length) are determined by hydraulic turbine normal operation requirements and are given in reference books. Nevertheless often such conditions arise when the correction of their size leading to their enlargement becomes inevitable. In particular, when there are rocks at a small depth below of the project position of the foundation slab it is feasible to increase a <b>suction</b> pipe’s <b>height</b> to place the foundation concrete on the strong rock. Or if it is necessary to make a motorway at the downstream side of a channel HPP lengthening of a suction pipe appears sensible. In such cases economic calculations are necessary on feasibility of suction pipe size change proposals. The use of an integral effect technique for such an analysis is proposed. The article provides a criterion for economic efficiency of the given technique. In conformity with it the calculations for a hydraulic turbine with 9 m diameter under acting head of 24 m are made. The calculation results are presented as graphs of dependencies of integral effect on varying parameters. The analysis of the results shows that a parameter being changed (suction pipe lengthening) has a distinct optimal value, which in the investigated variants is 2. 5 [...] . 3. 0 m. Herewith a maximal value of economically justified hydrogenerator suction pipe lengthening satisfying the criterion adopted is in the range of 7. 5 [...] . 8. 0 m. It is also shown that the value of the integral effect depends significantly on electric energy tariffs and the conditions of HPP operation...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{application}} of vacuum suction technique toreplace the hand operation {{is one of}} the effective waysin developing automatic chicken-catching machine. In orderto achieve the advantages of this technique, an indoor-simulation device was set up. It was used to simulate thecatching operation and measure the corresponding data ofthe <b>suction</b> force, <b>height</b> and angle of the suction device, as well as the transportation speed of the conveyer. These data can be used to modify the design of thechicken-catching machine. According to the test data, thewind speed at suction entrance is linearly dependentwith the rotation speed of the fan motor. The linearityis more than 99 %. For the chicken weighing between 1. 75 - 2. 0 kg,the suction device can be placed at 25 cm abovethe ground with the wind speed at 20 - 24. 5 m/s. The downwardconveyer can achieve the best performance if it has anangle of 22 degree with the ground and has a 10 cmextension in the forward direction. When the downwardconveyer has a transportation speed of 0. 26 ~ 0. 49 m/s, the chicken can be caught at a rate of 2300 ∼ 4400 chickenper hour. This research has made a prototype of the second- generation chicken-catching machine. This machine is 430 cm in length, 175 cm in width, and 180 cm in height. It isdriven by wheels to increase its mobility, and usesvacuum suction for chicken-catching operation. Thecaught chickens are packed in cages automatically withthe operations of conveyer. According to the test data,fans made in Taiwan can produce more suction power thanimported ones. They have a smaller size as well. Somemodifications have been made in this prototype,especially in its mobile system, steering system,structure, and vibrating system, such that it can achievea better mobility and have a better performance andstrength. The new designed electronic control systemsimplifies the whole operation. This machine can get 2000 chicken per hour at least in catching capacity,causing the total cost reduce by 13 percent compared totraditional way- catching by hand.
