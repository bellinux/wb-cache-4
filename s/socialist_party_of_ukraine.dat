5|$|On March 11, 2010, Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine {{approved}} {{the structure of}} the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. Note, Tihipko even though is a leader of the Strong Ukraine party, he was elected to Cabinet as unaffiliated. Strong Ukraine in Verkhovna Rada is not an independent party. The same goes with Vasyl Tsushko who was {{a former member of the}} <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ukraine</b> at the time of his appointment (he became the leader of that party in July 2010); Tsushko was appointed on quote of the Communist Party.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 2010 Minister of Environmental Protection Viktor Boiko (Bloc Lytvyn) was {{replaced}} by Mykola Zlochevskiy and Vice Prime Minister Volodymyr Seminozhenko was fired by the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament) the same day. A draft resolution proposing the dismissal of Semynozhenko was submitted by lawmaker Olha Bodnar of Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko. On July 10, 2010 Minister of Extraordinary Situations Nestor Shufrych was dismissed by Verkhovna Rada. For his dismissal voted 256 deputies. However Viktor Yanukovych found a new assignment for Shufrych and appointed him as the assistant {{to the secretary of}} the Council for National Security. Shufrych's duties were temporary assigned to Volodymyr Antonets till Mikhail Bolotskikh was appointed acting minister on July 23, 2010. Soon after the motion to overturn the 2004 Constitutional amendments was filed on July 14 by the representatives of the Azarov Government, Vasyl Tsushko, previously as an unaffiliated member of the government, was elected the leader of the <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ukraine</b> (extra parliamentarian party, non-coalition) on July 24, 2010.|$|E
25|$|In September 2002 the bloc was {{negotiating}} with nine pro-presidential (Kuchma) factions {{to form a}} coalition, a draft of a coalition agreement prepared by Our Ukraine faction member Yuri Kostenko and Labor Ukraine leader Serhiy Tyhypko was received by all faction leaders on 20 September 2009 (except by {{the leaders of the}} <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ukraine,</b> the Communist Party and the Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko). However the coalition never materialised.|$|E
50|$|On April 12, 1919 a new {{government}} was formed headed by Borys Martos replacing the Ostapenko's cabinet. Martos proclaimed {{the creation of a}} republic of worker's Councils (Soviets) and intention to conclude a peace treaty with the Bolshevik Russia. Such turn of events made a big impact on the political life <b>of</b> <b>Ukraine.</b> On April 20, 1919 numerous <b>socialists</b> <b>parties</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ukraine</b> (sovereigns, federalists, and others) entrusted Volodymyr Oskilko to deliver a memorandum to Petlyura for an immediate resignation of the Martos' government. Oskilko handed over the document to Petlyura in Zdolbuniv, who publicly torn it apart.|$|R

25|$|Even before Ukraine became {{independent}} in August 1991, {{political parties in}} Ukraine started to form around intellectuals and former Soviet dissidents. They posed the main opposition to the ruling Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine (CP(b)U). At the first convocation of the Verkhovna Rada those parties formed the parliamentary opposition People's Council. The most noticeable parties of the parliamentary opposition included the People's Movement of Ukraine (The Movement) and the Ukrainian Republican Party. Due to the August Putsch in Moscow (19–21 August 1991), a process to prohibit communist parties in Ukraine took place. Led by Oleksandr Moroz, the parliamentary faction of the CP(b)U, Group of 239, started a process to re-form the CP(b)U into the <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ukraine.</b> The restriction {{on the existence of}} communist parties in Ukraine was successfully adopted soon after the Ukrainian independence, however in the couple of years the resolution was later challenged and eventually the restriction was lifted. In 1993 in Donetsk the first congress of the reinstated Communist Party of Ukraine took place, with the Party led by Petro Symonenko.|$|E
2500|$|In the hastily {{organized}} 1994 {{parliamentary elections}} the communists surprisingly achieved the highest party rating, while the main opposing party, the Movement, did not gain even {{a quarter of}} their earned seats. The re-formed party of the CP(b)U, the [...] <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ukraine,</b> and its major ally, the Peasant Party of Ukraine, performed relatively strongly. About {{a third of the}} elected parliamentarians were not affiliated. The elections became a major fiasco of the Democratic forces in Ukraine. After the 1994 elections numerous independent political parties were elected to the Ukrainian parliament, leading to the formation of nine deputy groups and parliamentary factions: Communists, Socialists, Agrarians, Inter-regional Deputy Group (MDG), Unity, Center, Statehood, Reforms, and the Movement. The concept of a [...] "situational majority" [...] was first used during that convocation to form a parliamentary coalition. The ruling coalition in the parliament often included the Communist Party of Ukraine, the <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ukraine,</b> Agrarians, MDG, and Unity.|$|E

Though the communists {{stepped out of the}} alliance and though Symonenko opposed having one single candidate from the alliance in the 2004 presidential election, the other three parties remained allies until July 2006.|$|E

His strongly independent line soon attracted hostility from the increasingly authoritarian government of Leonid Kuchma; during the October 1999 presidential election, his commentaries prompted a call from Kuchma's headquarters to say [...] "that he had been blacklisted to be dealt with after the election." [...] In 1999 he was a spokesman for the Progressive <b>Socialist</b> <b>Party</b> <b>of</b> <b>Ukraine</b> Nataliya Vitrenko.
