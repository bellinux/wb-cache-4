5|$|Construction of {{the reactor}} itself {{commenced}} in February 1944. Watched by Compton, Matthias, DuPont's Crawford Greenewalt, Leona Woods and Fermi, who inserted the first slug, the reactor was powered up beginning on 13 September 1944. Over {{the next few}} days, 838 tubes were loaded and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared well but around 03:00 the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The cooling water was investigated {{to see if there}} was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor <b>started</b> <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> only to shut down once more.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Fermi {{inserted}} the first uranium fuel slug into the B Reactor at the Hanford Site, the production reactor designed to breed plutonium in large quantities. Like X-10, {{it had been}} designed by Fermi's team at the Metallurgical Laboratory, and built by DuPont, but it was much larger, and was water-cooled. Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded, and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared to be well, but around 03:00, the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The Army and DuPont turned to Fermi's team for answers. The cooling water was investigated {{to see if there}} was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor suddenly <b>started</b> <b>up</b> <b>again,</b> only to shut down once more a few hours later. The problem was traced to neutron poisoning from xenon-135, a fission product with a half-life of 9.2 hours. Fortunately, DuPont had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this over-engineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium.|$|E

25|$|An open {{pressurized}} system such as {{an automobile}} air conditioner can be more susceptible to leak its operating gases. Open systems rely on lubricant in the system to splash on pump components and seals. If it is not operated frequently enough, the lubricant on the seals slowly evaporates, and then the seals begin to leak until the system is no longer functional and must be recharged. By comparison, a hermetic system can sit unused for years, and can usually be <b>started</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> at any time without requiring maintenance or experiencing any loss of system pressure.|$|E

25|$|The {{widespread}} strikes of 1980 {{were far}} from being the first clashes between the ruling party and the working class in Poland after World War II. Despite having a “socialist” government, the elite of the Polish ruling class averaged an income twenty times that of the blue-collar worker. This elite ruling class owned or largely controlled the police, media and industry of the state, including the state-organized unions. Insufficient pay and food shortages, in addition to a growing movement in favor of independent union activism led to strikes in 1956 and 1970 which left hundreds of workers dead from clashes with police, and both the 1970 and 1976 strikes ended with some concessions but subsequent additional repressions from management. Workers were increasingly dissatisfied with their standard of living and the half-hearted responses of the government to their calls for social justice, and when in July 1980 the government attempted to raise the price of meat even further, sit-in strikes <b>started</b> <b>up</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
500|$|The young {{actress who}} {{originally}} played Emily {{was terrified of}} the hospital setting in this episode, {{and as a result}} the producers had to recast the role and reshoot all footage featuring her in the previous episode [...] "Christmas Carol". Director Kim Manners recalls, [...] "I called Bob Goodwin and said, 'We're dead in the water here, pal. This little actress is not cooperating at all'. We recast that role and <b>started</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> the next day." [...] The show's casters replaced her with Lauren Diewold, who had previously appeared on an episode of Millennium. Due to the show's shooting schedule, the producers were unable to use Gillian Anderson to reshoot the previous episode's scenes, resulting in Anderson's double being used instead, with the footage pieced together in the editing room.|$|E

[...] In the divisional round of the playoffs, the Panthers faced Seattle in Seattle, notorious for being a tough opposing field to play in, and lost 31-17. [...] The Seahawks would go on to lose Super Bowl XLIX. In the 2015 season the next year, the teams faced off in Seattle, where the Panthers won another close game, 27-23. [...] In the divisional round of the playoffs, the Panthers faced Seattle at Bank of America stadium, where they had yet to beat a Russell Wilson led Seahawks team. [...] By halftime they led 31-0, but the Seahawks rebounded and scored 24 unanswered points before the Panthers were able to seal the victory, 31-24. [...] The Panthers would go on to lose Super Bowl 50. [...] In the 2016 season, the teams met in Seattle, where the Panthers were beaten 40-7. Since the 2012 season, Carolina is [...] overall against Seattle and [...] in the playoffs. [...] The rivalry aspect stems from how close the majority of the matches have been {{and the fact that they}} have played each other seven times between 2012 and 2017—at least once a year.

At Richard Watson's suggestion Clifford auditioned for the vacancy and was engaged to play Green's roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, which were produced in repertory by the company. He was coached by the company's director, J. M. Gordon, who had worked with W.S. Gilbert, but Carte encouraged Clifford to recreate all his characters afresh. The Times said of his performance in The Yeomen of the Guard, [...] "the final moments in which the heartbroken merryman struggles to hide his grief are played with real beauty. Mr Clifford makes no attempt to imitate his predecessors in the part, and his performance gains immensely as a result."

2500|$|Katatonia is a Swedish metal band {{formed in}} Stockholm in 1991 by Jonas Renkse and Anders Nyström. The band {{started as a}} studio-only project for the duo, as an outlet for the band's love of death metal. Increasing {{popularity}} lead them to add more band members for live performances, though outside of the band's founders, the lineup was constantly changing, revolving door of musicians throughout the 1990s, notably including Mikael Åkerfeldt of the band Opeth for a period. After two death/doom albums, Dance of December Souls (1993) and Brave Murder Day (1996), problems with Renkse's vocal cords coupled with new musical influences lead the band away from the screamed vocals of death metal to a more traditional, melodic form of heavy metal music. The band released two more albums, Discouraged Ones (1998) and Tonight's Decision (1999), before settling into a stable quintet lineup for all of 2000's. The band released four more albums with said lineup - [...] Last Fair Deal Gone Down (2001), Viva Emptiness (2003), The Great Cold Distance (2006), and Night Is the New Day (2009), with the band slowly moving away from their metal sound while adding more progressive rock sounds to their work over time. While lineup changes <b>started</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> into the 2010s, Renkse and Nyström persisted, and the band continued to release music, including Dead End Kings (2012) and their most recent, their tenth studio album, The Fall of Hearts, released on May 20, 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Black {{residents}} have been present in Harlem continually since the 1630s, and as the neighborhood modernized in the late 19th century, they could be found especially {{in the area around}} 125th Street and in the [...] "Negro tenements" [...] on West 130th Street. By 1900, tens of thousands lived in Harlem. The mass migration of blacks into the area began in 1904, due to another real estate crash, the worsening of conditions for blacks elsewhere in the city, and the leadership of black real estate entrepreneurs including Phillip Payton, Jr. After the collapse of the 1890s, new speculation and construction <b>started</b> <b>up</b> <b>again</b> in 1903 and the resulting glut of housing led to a crash in values in 1904 and 1905 that eclipsed the late-19th century slowdown. Landlords could not find white renters for their properties, so Philip Payton stepped in to bring blacks. His company, the Afro-American Realty Company, has been credited with the migration of blacks from their previous neighborhoods, the Tenderloin, San Juan Hill (now the site of Lincoln Center), Minetta Lane in Greenwich Village and Hell's Kitchen in the west 40s and 50s. The move to northern Manhattan was driven in part by fears that anti-black riots such as those that had occurred in the Tenderloin in 1900 and in San Juan Hill in 1905 might recur. In addition, a number of tenements that had been occupied by blacks in the west 30s were destroyed at this time {{to make way for the}} construction of the original Penn Station.|$|E
