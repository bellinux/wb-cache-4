50|$|The {{business}} model behind the electric utility {{has changed over}} the years playing a vital role in shaping the electricity industry into what it is today; from generation, transmission, distribution, to the final local retailing. This has occurred prominently since the reform of the electricity supply industry in England and Wales in 1990. In some countries, wholesale electricity markets operate, with generators and retailers trading electricity in a similar manner to shares and currency. As deregulation continues further, utilities are driven to sell their assets as the energy market follows in line with the gas market in use of the futures and spot markets and other financial arrangements. Even globalization with foreign purchases are taking place. One such purchase was when the UK’s National Grid, the largest private electric utility in the world, bought New England’s electric system for $3.2 billion. Domestically, local electric and gas firms have merged operations as they saw the advantages of joint affiliation, especially with the reduced cost of joint-metering. Technological advances will take place in the competitive wholesale electric markets, such examples already being utilized include fuel cells used in space flight; aeroderivative gas turbines used in jet aircraft; <b>solar</b> <b>engineering</b> and photovoltaic systems; off-shore wind farms; and the communication advances spawned by the digital world, particularly with microprocessing which aids in monitoring and dispatching.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review some key issues and {{prospects}} related to solar photovoltaic (PV) power engineering in the Republic of Serbia. The solar PV energy sector in the Republic of Serbia is poorly developed, despite the very good geographical position of Serbia and recent introduction of feed-in-tariffs (FITs) by the Serbian Government. This paper is aimed at analysing and assessing the potential, status and perspectives of <b>solar</b> PV power <b>engineering</b> in the Republic of Serbia. Solar radiation maps for the territory of Serbia using PVGIS Â© software are presented and discussed. Some practical data and considerations are given from the point of view of a customer or company keen to invest in the solar PV electricity production in Serbia. The importance of the research and educational support in the field of <b>solar</b> PV power <b>engineering</b> is emphasised. The aim of this paper is to encourage further analyses and eventually investment in the PV energy sector in Serbia. It is expected that the Serbian authorities will refine and improve their regulatory policy in the field of renewable energy sources (RES) particularly within <b>solar</b> PV power <b>engineering</b> sector. The results of this study show that the Republic of Serbia has great potential for utilizing stand-alone and grid-connected solar PV energy systems and can seriously rely on this important RES sector in the future.
