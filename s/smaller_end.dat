5|$|Large, heavy horses, {{weighing}} from , {{the ancestors}} of today's draught horses, were used, particularly in Europe, from the Middle Ages onward. They pulled heavy loads like supply wagons and were disposed to remain calm in battle. Some historians believe they may have carried the heaviest-armoured knights of the European Late Middle Ages, though others dispute this claim, indicating that the destrier, or knight's battle horse, was a medium-weight animal. It is also disputed whether the destrier class included draught animals or not. Breeds at the <b>smaller</b> <b>end</b> of the heavyweight category may have included {{the ancestors of}} the Percheron, agile for their size and physically able to manoeuvre in battle.|$|E
5|$|Subwoofers use speaker drivers (woofers) {{typically}} between 8-inch (20cm) and 21-inch (53cm) in diameter. Some uncommon subwoofers use larger drivers, {{and single}} prototype subwoofers {{as large as}} 60-inch (152cm) have been fabricated. On the <b>smaller</b> <b>end</b> of the spectrum, subwoofer drivers as small as 4-inch (10cm) may be used. Small subwoofer drivers in the 4-inch range are typically used in small computer speaker systems and compact home theatre subwoofer cabinets. The size of the driver and number of drivers in a cabinet depends {{on the design of}} the loudspeaker enclosure, the size of the cabinet, the desired sound pressure level, the lowest frequency targeted and the level of permitted distortion. The most common subwoofer driver sizes used for sound reinforcement in nightclubs, raves and pop/rock concerts are 10-, 12-, 15- and 18-inch models (25cm, 30cm, 38cm, and 45cm respectively). The largest available sound reinforcement subwoofers, 21-inch (53cm) drivers, are less commonly seen.|$|E

40|$|Having in mind con-rods for {{motorbike}} and car engines, and {{spurred by}} the disagreements evidenced in the pertinent literature, the maximum circumferential stresses within the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> are investigated analytically, photoelastically, and numerically. The analytical models are based upon a plane assumption, and they adopt both beam and theory of elasticity idealizations. The plane photoelastic study concentrates on <b>small</b> <b>ends</b> with outer to inner radii ratios ranging from 1. 2 to 1. 5. A plane numerical model aimed at thoroughly mimicking the pin ovalization is developed, and a design chart of the peak hoop stress within the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> is provided for {{a wide spectrum of}} <b>small</b> <b>end</b> and pin geometries, for zero initial clearance. Such diagrams allow a prompt preliminary dimensioning of the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> to be carried out, which may be refined by effecting a three-dimensional finite element study of the specific conrod geometry. The consequences of an initial clearance between <b>small</b> <b>end</b> bore and gudgeon pin are examined for selected geometries, and three-dimensional aspects are explored for specific con-rod shapes...|$|R
50|$|In the {{semi-floating}} configuration, the pin {{is usually}} fixed {{relative to the}} piston by an interference fit with the journal in the piston. (This replaced the earlier set screw method.) The connecting rod <b>small</b> <b>end</b> bearing thus acts as the bearing alone. In this configuration, only the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> bearing requires a bearing surface, if any. If needed, this is provided by either electroplating the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> bearing journal with a suitable metal, or more usually by inserting a sleeve bearing or needle bearing into {{the eye of the}} <b>small</b> <b>end,</b> which has an interference fit with the aperture of the <b>small</b> <b>end.</b> During overhaul, it is usually possible to replace this bearing sleeve if it is badly worn. The reverse configuration, fixing the gudgeon pin to the connecting rod instead of to the piston, is implemented using an interference fit with the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> eye instead, with the gudgeon pin journals in the piston functioning as bearings. This arrangement is usually more difficult to manufacture and service because two bearing surfaces or inserted sleeves complicate the design. In addition, the pin must be precisely set so that the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> eye is central. Because of thermal expansion considerations, this arrangement was more usual for single-cylinder engines as opposed to multiple cylinder engines with long cylinder blocks and crankcases, until precision manufacturing became more commonplace.|$|R

25|$|Blackpool 31 {{was built}} in 1901 at the Midland Railway Carriage and Wagon Co. for Blackpool Tramway, {{originally}} as a four-wheel double-deck open topper, for use on the Marton route. In a trial of its intended Standard class tram designs, it was rebuilt in 1918, which saw the body being extended and remounted on a new underframe fitted with two English Electric 4′ wheelbase equal-wheel bogies, to the American McGuire pattern (the <b>smaller</b> <b>end</b> windows correspond to the length by which the body was extended), with BTH 265C 35hp motors and BTH 510 controllers.|$|E
25|$|Many {{types of}} gear {{have been used}} to catch blue crabs along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Initially people used very simple {{techniques}} and gear, which included hand lines, dip nets, and push nets among a variety of other gear types. The trotline, a long baited twine set in waters 5–15 feet deep, was the first major gear type used commercially to target hard crabs. Use of commercial trotlines is now mostly limited to the tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. In the Gulf of Mexico, trotline use drastically declined after invention of the crab pot in 1938. Crab pots are rigid boxlike traps made of hexagonal or square wire mesh. They possess between two and four funnels that extend into the trap, with the <b>smaller</b> <b>end</b> of the funnel inside of the trap. A central compartment made of smaller wire mesh holds bait. Crabs attracted by odorant plumes from the bait, often an oily fish, enter the trap through the funnels and cannot escape.|$|E
40|$|Keywords：pipe elbows; {{reducing}} elbows; elastic stress; in–plane close-bending moment; limit close-bending moment Abstract：Elastic {{stresses and}} limit close-bending moments of reducing elbows subject to in–plane close-bending moments were validated by limit element analysis (LMA) and testing. Results of LMA show {{that if the}} end bend moment M acts on <b>small</b> <b>end</b> while the large end is fixed, the largest movement acts on neutral line near the larger end, and large circumferential stress lies on inside surface near neutral lines but deflect to intrados of large end. For the same model, if the end bend moment M acts on large <b>end</b> while the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> is fixed, the largest movement acts on near the <b>small</b> <b>end</b> and lies on neutral line, and larger stress acts on <b>small</b> <b>end</b> and nearby. Results of testing show that stress character in tension stress and compressive stresses {{are consistent with the}} calculation results from formula. The limit bending moment calculation results from formula of reducing elbow is conservative, but is consistent with the formula of the limit bending moment, which is controlled by <b>small</b> <b>end</b> of reducing elbow...|$|R

By choosing a length scale, L, and velocity scale, U, the equation can be expressed in nondimensional form containing the Reynolds number, Re=UL/ν [...] There are two obvious differences between an insect wing and an airfoil: An insect wing is much smaller and it flaps. Using a dragonfly as an example, Its chord (c) is about 1cm, its wing length (l) about 4cm, and its wing frequency (f) about 40Hz. The tip speed (u) is about 1m/s, and the corresponding Reynolds number, Re=uc/ν about 103. At the <b>smaller</b> <b>end,</b> a Chalcid wasp has a wing length of about 0.5–0.7mm and beats its wing at about 400Hz. Its Reynolds number is about 25. The range of Reynolds number in insect flight is about 10 to 104, which lies in between the two limits that are convenient for theories: inviscid steady flows around an airfoil and Stokes flow experienced by a swimming bacterium. For this reason, this intermediate range is not well understood. On the other hand, it is perhaps the most ubiquitous regime among the things we see. Falling leaves and seeds, fishes, and birds all encounter unsteady flows similar to that seen around an insect.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} effects of divergent selection and different positions of Japanese quail eggs in artificial incubation on hatchability, egg weight loss, chick weight. 300 Japanese quail (100 birds in each line) were used for egg collection. These lines have been selected for high (HW) and low (LW) body weight for 9 generations and compared with control line(C). Average of 822 eggs (274 eggs in each line) was 14. 19, 12. 02 and 10. 2 in HW, C and LW, respectively, all at 13 weeks of age. Based on eggs positions during incubation were divided into two experimental groups (137 eggs in each group in each line: vertical position with <b>small</b> <b>end</b> up, vertical position with <b>small</b> <b>end</b> down with turning). The eggs incubated in vertical and <b>small</b> <b>end</b> down had the higher hatchability (59. 2 %), while those incubated in vertical position with <b>small</b> <b>end</b> up presented the lower hatchability (8. 5 %). Egg position influenced water loss during incubation. The groups with better hatchability presented lower egg weight loss and better hatch weight.
