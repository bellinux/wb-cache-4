40|$|During wine production, grape solids {{have a large}} {{impact on}} {{fermentation}} characteristics and the organoleptic qualities of the resulting wine. We review here the research carried out on grape solids. We begin {{by focusing on the}} origin, physical characteristics and composition of these <b>solids,</b> <b>and</b> the changes in these aspects occurring during fermentation. We then consider the effect of solids on fermentation, the role of sterols, the control of <b>solids</b> <b>and</b> interactions between <b>solids</b> <b>and</b> other nutrients. <b>Solids</b> exert their effects on alcoholic fermentation mainly by modulating lipid supply. The balance between <b>solid</b> content <b>and</b> nitrogen is a key factor in fermentation control. The study of grape <b>solids</b> is recent <b>and</b> requires further development. Knowledge of the composition of these <b>solids,</b> <b>and</b> of sterol uptake mechanisms by yeast should facilitate improvements in fermentation control...|$|R

5|$|Being {{chemically}} stable, neptunium phosphates {{have been}} investigated for potential use in immobilizing nuclear waste. Neptunium pyrophosphate (α-NpP2O7), a green solid, has been produced in the reaction between neptunium dioxide and boron phosphate at 1100°C, though neptunium(IV) phosphate has so far remained elusive. The series of compounds NpM2(PO4)3, where M is an alkali metal (Li, Na, K, Rb, or Cs), are all known. Some neptunium sulfates have been characterized, both aqueous and <b>solid</b> <b>and</b> at various oxidation states of neptunium (IV through VI have been observed). Additionally, neptunium carbonates {{have been investigated}} to achieve {{a better understanding of}} the behavior of neptunium in geological repositories and the environment, where it may come into contact with carbonate and bicarbonate aqueous solutions and form soluble complexes.|$|E

5|$|The single {{leafless}} stem or scape, appearing {{from early}} to late spring {{depending on the}} species, bears from 1 to 20 blooms. Stem shape depends on the species, some are highly compressed with a visible seam, while others are rounded. The stems are upright and located at {{the centre of the}} leaves. In a few species such as hN. hedraeanthus the stem is oblique (asymmetrical). The stem is hollow in the upper portion but towards the bulb is more <b>solid</b> <b>and</b> filled with a spongy material.|$|E
5|$|This {{cold weather}} {{exacerbated}} the fuel problem. Stockpiles of coal at the pits and depots froze <b>solid</b> <b>and</b> {{could not be}} moved. The snow also trapped 750,000 railway wagons of coal and made roads unusable, further hampering transport. A force of 100,000 British and Polish troops and German prisoners of war were put to work clearing snow from the railways by hand, while desperate {{attempts were made to}} get fuel to power stations by coal-carrying ships which risked storms, fog and ice to reach their destinations. Despite such expedients, lack of fuel forced many power stations to shut down or reduce their output. The Royal Navy launched Operation Blackcurrant, which used diesel generators aboard submarines to provide supplementary power to coastal towns and dockyards.|$|E
5|$|Tylopilus plumbeoviolaceus (formerly Boletus plumbeoviolaceus), {{commonly}} known as the violet-grey bolete, is a fungus of the bolete family. First described in 1936, the mushroom has a disjunct distribution, and is distributed in eastern North America and Korea. The fruit bodies of the fungus are violet when young, but fade into a chocolate brown color when mature. They are <b>solid</b> <b>and</b> relatively large—cap diameter up to , with a white pore surface that later turns pink, and a white mycelium {{at the base of the}} stem. Like most boletes of genus Tylopilus, the mushroom is inedible due to its bitter taste. A number of natural products have been identified from the fruit bodies, including unique chemical derivatives of ergosterol, a fungal sterol.|$|E
