40|$|Phototrophic <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> in the chemocline of Lake Cadagno, Switzerland, were {{dominated}} by purple <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> before 1998, but their composition shifted after a presumed disturbance to consist of mainly green <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria.</b> This study focused on comparative analyses {{of the distribution of}} the green sulfur compared to the purple <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> by analyzing specific populations along fine scale depth profiles of the chemocline of Lake Cadagno. Water samples were collected from the chemocline on October 14 th, 1998, and on September 28 th, 2004. A detailed analysis of chemocline depth profiles revealed that total biomass of phototrophic <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> was three times higher in 2004 than in 1998. The three-fold increase of biomass was entirely due to increments in abundance of one population of green <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria,</b> identified as Chlorobium clathratiforme. Abundance of purple <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> remained unchanged with respect to overall numbers in the chemocline, but also with respect to distribution of different populations in depth in the chemocline. Aggregates of small-celled purple <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> decreased in size about four-fold, but remained associated with sulfate-reducing bacteria of the genus Desulfocapsa. Compared to 1998, these had increased in numbers about three times in 2004, resulting in about ten times higher numbers per aggregate.

40|$|In situ {{hybridization}} {{was used}} to study the spatio-temporal distribution of phototrophic <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> in the permanent chemocline of meromictic Lake Cadagno, Switzerland. At all four sampling times during the year the numerically most important phototrophic <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> in the chemocline were small-celled purple <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> of two yet uncultured populations designated D and F. Other small-celled purple <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> (Amoebobacter purpureus and Lamprocystis roseopersicina) were found in numbers about one order of magnitude lower.

In March and June when low light intensities reached the chemocline, cell densities of all populations, with the exception of L. roseopersicina, were about one order of magnitude lower than in August and October when light intensities were much higher. Most populations were evenly distributed throughout the whole chemocline during March and June, while in August and October a microstratification of populations was detected suggesting specific eco-physiological adaptations of different populations of phototrophic <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> to the steep physico-chemical gradients in the chemocline of Lake Cadagn...|$|R
40|$|Microbial mats {{characteristically}} {{are dominated}} by a few functional groups of microbes: cyanobacteria, colorless <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria,</b> purple <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria,</b> and sulfate-reducing bacteria. Their combined metabolic activities result in steep environmental microgradients, particularly of oxygen and sulfide. The driving force of most microbial mats is photosynthesis by cyanobacteria and algae. Subsequently, sulfate-reducing bacteria, using excretion-, lysis-, and decomposition products of cyanobacteria, produce sulfide by the dissimilatory reduction of sulfate. The sulfide can be reoxidized to sulfate by colorless and purple <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Colorless <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> are chemotrophic organisms primarily oxidizing sulfide and other reduced forms of sulfur with oxygen to obtain energy. The oxidation of reduced sulfur species also provides reducing equivalents for the reduction of carbon dioxide to cellular carbon. The final product of sulfide oxidation is sulfate, with elemental sulfur, deposited extracellularly, as the principal intermediate. Purple <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> primarily are anaerobic phototrophic organisms using sulfide and other reduced forms of sulfur exclusively as the electron donor for the reduction of CO 2 to cellular carbon. Usually, sulfur is temporarily stored intracellularly. The final product of the oxidation of reduced forms of sulfur is sulfate. The niches for these metabolically different groups of microbes in ecosystems with steep, often non-overlapping, gradients of oxygen and sulfide appear to be spatially separated. However, maximum viable counts of colorless <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> and purple <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> were both found in the top 5 - 10 mm of mats. Unexpectedly, viable counts of sulfate-reducing bacteria also peaked at the same depth horizon. Sulfide is inhibitory for most oxygenic phototrophs. Sulfide production immediately underneath the layer of cyanobacteria might inhibit their growth, and, consequently, that of the entire ecosystem. In microbial mats this effect is minimized by the combined action of colorless and purple <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Colorless <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> generally have a much higher affinity for sulfide than purple <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria,</b> however, in microbial mats, their activity is hampered by low oxygen supply rates. As shown by pure culture studies with colorless <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria,</b> sulfide is incompletely oxidized when oxygen is short in supply, resulting {{in the production of}} potential electron donors for purple <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria,</b> such as <b>sulfur,</b> thiosulfate and polysulfides. In the absence of purple <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria,</b> colorless <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{would not be able to}} maintain a low sulfide concentration due to shortage of oxygen, which in turn would result in increased inhibition of oxygenic photosynthesis. It thus appears that the combined action of all four groups of functional microbes mentioned effectively results in optimal growth of these recent ''stromatolites''...|$|R
40|$|A {{deterministic}} one-dimensional reaction {{diffusion model}} was constructed to simulate benthic stratification patterns and population dynamics of cyanobacteria, purple and colorless <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{as found in}} marine microbial mats. The model involves the major biogeochemical processes of the sulfur cycle and includes growth metabolism and their kinetic parameters as described from laboratory experimentation. Hence, the metabolic production and consumption processes are coupled to population growth. The model {{is used to calculate}} benthic oxygen, sulfide and light profiles and to infer spatial relationships and interactions among the different populations. Furthermore, the model is used to explore the effect of different abiotic and biotic environmental parameters on the community structure. A strikingly clear pattern emerged of the interaction between purple and colorless sulfur bacteria: either colorless <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> dominate or a coexistence is found of colorless and purple <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria.</b> The model predicts that purple <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> only proliferate when the studied environmental parameters surpass well-defined threshold levels. However, once the appropriate conditions do occur, the purple <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> are extremely successful as their biomass outweighs that of colorless <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> by a factor of up to 17. The typical stratification pattern predicted closely resembles the often described bilayer communities which comprise a layer of purple <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> below a cyanobacterial top-layer; colorless <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> are predicted to sandwich in between both layers.

40|$|Abstract: Green <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{have gained}} much {{attention}} {{because of a}} number of highly interesting features including unique structures of the photosynthetic apparatus and the presence of chlorosomes as very powerful light antenna that can capture minute amounts of light. This has important ecological consequences, because the efficient light-harvesting determines the ecological niche of these bacteria at the lowermost part of stratified environments where the least of light is available. Furthermore, the strict dependency on photosynthesis to provide energy for growth and the obligate phototrophy of green <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> together with their characteristic sulfur metabolism have provoked much interest in their physiology, ecology and genomics. The oxidation of sulfide as their outmost important photosynthetic electron donor involves the deposition of elemental sulfur globules outside the cells and separates the process of sulfide oxidation to sulfate into two parts. This is the basis for stable syntrophic associations between green <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> and sulfur- and sulfate-reducing bacteria in which the sulfur compounds are recycled. The green <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> are distantly related to other bacteria and represent the phylum Chlorobi, though the known representatives are taxonomically treated as Chlorobiaceae with the genera Chlorobium, Chlorobaculum, Prosthecochloris and Chloroherpeton. Key Concepts: Green <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> depend on light for life due to their obligate phototrophic metabolism. Green <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> perform a highly efficient photosynthesis due to the presence of light harvesting organelles, the chlorosomes, which are filled with special bacteriochlorophyll molecules. Green <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> inhabit the lowermost part of the photic environments due to their efficient light capture. Green <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> inhabit the lowermost part of the chemocline in the stratified environment due to their sensitivity to oxygen, their high sulfide tolerance and their dependence in light. Green <b>sulfur</b> <b>bacteria</b> are important drivers of oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds in the stratified, sulfide-containing environment receiving low irradiation. ...|$|R
