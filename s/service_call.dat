500|$|In August and September 1979, the Clash {{recorded}} London Calling. Produced by Guy Stevens, {{a former}} A executive {{who had worked}} with Mott the Hoople and Traffic, the double album was a mix of punk rock, reggae, ska, rockabilly, traditional rock and roll and other elements possessed of an energy that had hardly flagged since the band's early days and more polished production.
