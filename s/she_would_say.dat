5|$|Abi and Babe {{discover}} that Ben's half sister Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper) {{has been using}} Phil's credit card, so they force her to return everything she has bought. Babe asks Abi for a favour, but Abi realises that Babe has already assumed that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> yes, so calls Babe a user. As revenge, Babe sends Ben a letter, telling him of the fake pregnancy. Louise finds the letter and blackmails Abi, telling her to move away with Ben. Abi tries to persuade Ben into moving but he refuses, saying {{he needs to be}} there for alcoholic Phil, and Abi tells Louise that Ben will always believe his girlfriend over his sister. Abi tells Babe that she is worried that Ben will find out, so Babe suggests that Abi tells Ben the truth. However, Abi allows Louise to continue using Phil's credit card. Later, Abi catches Ben and Louise arguing and assumes it is over the letter, and she inadvertently reveals she was never pregnant, but Ben was referring to Phil's credit card. In The Vic, Ben gets drunk and kisses Abi in the toilets and starts to undress her, but then drags her into the pub in her underwear and reveals via the karaoke microphone that she made up her pregnancy. Abi is humiliated and is taken to Dot Branning's (June Brown) house by her uncle Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), however, an enraged Phil takes her away in his car, but is stopped by Jay, who insists that enough people have been hurt. When Bobby Beale (Eliot Carrington) confesses to killing Lucy, Max is released, but refuses to see Abi or Lauren.|$|E
25|$|After Wyatt's death, Josephine {{collaborated with}} two of her husband's cousins, Mabel Earp Cason and her sister Vinolia Earp Ackerman, to {{document}} her life. The cousins recorded events in her later life, but they found Josephine evasive about the timing and nature of events during her time in the Arizona Territory and Tombstone. She would not even talk about the key events of 1881-82, their key years in Tombstone. The most <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> is that {{she returned to the}} Arizona Territory in 1881 and joined Johnny Behan in Tombstone. She said that she had believed Behan was planning to marry her, but he kept putting it off, and she grew disillusioned.|$|E
500|$|She hoped Lennon {{would become}} bored with music; often saying, [...] "The guitar's all right John, but you'll never {{make a living}} out of it". In later years, Lennon would jokingly remind her of the comment, and later had a silver plaque made {{engraved}} with her words. When later asked about the plaque, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that Lennon had it made for her husband, and not her.|$|E

500|$|Most actors of {{the film}} were Nibbelink's friends and children, whose voices he {{recorded}} in a studio in his basement. The film's Spanish dub was originally done in Madrid. Nibbelink said his daughter's voice-over was completely unscripted. [...] "I would [...] take these silly improvs that my little daughter would do. I mean, lines like, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> ‘Babies – p-ew! I hate stinky babies!’ I said, ‘That’s hilarious!’ So I would use it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Dear Future Husband" [...] was {{inspired}} by Trainor's love for harmonies and a joke she made with her father, where <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> [...] "that her future husband is out there somewhere, 'chilling. Trainor reminisced on her past romantic relationships, where she was mishandled, and with the track, {{she wanted to make}} a statement that women should be treated better by their boyfriends. In an interview with Seventeen, Trainor said, [...] "It's like, I'm awesome, why would you not want to marry me and date me?" [...] Trainor considers [...] "Dear Future Husband" [...] {{to be one of the}} strongest tracks on her studio album Title (2015).|$|E
500|$|Debbie Rowe met Michael Jackson in the mid-1980s, {{while working}} as an {{assistant}} for the pop star's dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein. Rowe treated Jackson's vitiligo, {{which he had been}} diagnosed with in 1986 and which would affect his physical appearance for the remainder of his life. Rowe supported Jackson, providing answers to the questions Jackson asked about his medical condition. The pair became good friends; the pop star frequently sent autographed merchandise to the woman, who hung it on the walls of her office. According to Rowe's friend Tanya Boyd, the dermatologist's assistant would obsess over Jackson, gushing over him and his traits. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> to her friend, [...] "If people knew him like I knew him, they would not think he was strange. He's unique, kinky, actually." ...|$|E

What <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>say</b> about living in Australia? What <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>say</b> about the people <b>she</b> met? What <b>would</b> <b>she</b> <b>say</b> about the university and about our teaching? Now we can, and it is very revealing...|$|R

500|$|On graduation, Ching-teng enrolls at the National Chiao Tung University. Chia-Yi, {{who did not}} do well on the {{admission}} exam because she was ill on that day, only manages to enter the National Taipei University of Education with her mediocre test results. Depressed and upset, she is consoled by Ching-teng, who calls her long-distance almost every night from the university. During the winter holiday season that year, the two go on their first [...] "date", during which Ching-teng asks Chia-yi if she loves him. However, fearing <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> no, he decides that he would rather not hear her answer (it is revealed later that her reply would have been [...] "yes"). Ching-teng later organizes a fight night and invites Chia-yi to watch, hoping to impress her with his [...] "strength". On the contrary, Chia-yi finds it childish for Ching-teng to injure himself for no reason. This upsets Ching-teng, sparking a quarrel that causes the two to break up.|$|E
500|$|Hathaway {{prepared}} for the part by volunteering for a week as an assistant at an auction house where she was [...] "put through the wringer" [...] according to Weisberger, who adds that Hathaway supplemented that by asking her many questions about working for Wintour. Frankel recalls that she was nervous {{through most of the}} shooting, particularly when working late, since Raffaello Follieri, her boyfriend at that time, preferred strongly that she not do so; she was also having health issues due to a cyst. The director said she was [...] "terrified" [...] before starting her first scene with Streep, who had begun her working relationship with Hathaway by saying first [...] "I think you're perfect for the role and I'm so happy we're going to be working on this together" [...] then warning her that was the last nice thing <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>say.</b> Streep applied this philosophy to everyone else on set as well, keeping her distance from the cast and crew members unless it was necessary to discuss something with them.|$|E
500|$|Author Garry Wills {{believed}} that Davis was generally underrated {{as an actress}} because her constrained part in Hellcats was her most widely seen performance. In addition, Davis downplayed her Hollywood goals: promotional material from MGM in 1949 said that her [...] "greatest ambition" [...] {{was to have a}} [...] "successful happy marriage"; decades later, in 1975, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "I was never really a career woman but [...] only because I hadn't found the man I wanted to marry. I couldn't sit around and do nothing, so I became an actress." [...] Ronald Reagan biographer Lou Cannon nevertheless characterized her as a [...] "reliable" [...] and [...] "solid" [...] performer who held her own in performances with better-known actors. After her final film, Crash Landing (1958), Davis appeared for a brief time as a guest star in television dramas, such as the Zane Grey Theatre episode [...] "The Long Shadow" [...] (1961), where she played opposite Ronald Reagan, as well as Wagon Train and The Tall Man, until she retired as an actress in 1962.|$|E

500|$|She {{had kept}} mementos of Lennon for years, but began {{auctioning}} them off after his death, including a personally drawn Christmas card from Lennon to her, which fetched £8,800 at Christie's in August 1981. [...] With her finances in an unsteady state – <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> in 1999 that [...] "Apart from John, the men I {{have fallen in}} love with have never been good at earning a living" [...] – more of her memorabilia of Lennon went up for auction in 1991, including antiques from Kenwood. [...] She said at the time, [...] "I've enjoyed these things for 30 years. But it's time for a change." [...] Another set of items, including some of Lennon's drug paraphernalia, brought over $60,000 for her in 1995. She later said, [...] "I think in life we collect so much baggage, when you have a clearout, you send it to a car-boot sale, etc. My baggage was in demand and sold at Christie's. When you have to pay the bills, you're not proud and you can't take it with you." ...|$|E
500|$|Title {{was entirely}} written and {{composed}} by Meghan Trainor and Kevin Kadish, and produced by Kadish. The pair recorded the EP at The Carriage House in Nolensville, Tennessee. It was mastered by Dave Kutch at The Mastering Palace in New York City, New York. Besides writing and composing the record, Trainor was {{also responsible for}} its drum programming, percussion instrumentation, clapping and ukulele melodies, as well as handling the EP's executive production with Kadish. Title was developed using {{a wide range of}} other instrumentation; drums, acoustic guitar, electric guitar and bass—all produced by Kadish. David Baron and Jim Hoke were the only two other musicians involved in the EP's production, and were responsible for the record's piano, baritone saxophone, tenor saxophone and hammond organ instrumentation. In an interview with The Baltimore Sun, Kadish spoke of the record's conception, [...] "We were like, 'Let's do a '50s EP and see if anybody likes it, just for fun.'" [...] Regarding the title of the EP, Trainor told Popjustice, [...] "So I've called the EP Title. Cos obviously everyone was going, 'what's the title', and I was like, 'hey, I'm clever, I'm gonna make it this'." [...] The name was deemed [...] "creative" [...] by Idolator's Mike Wass. Dear Future Husband" [...] was inspired by a joke Trainor made with her father, where <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that her future husband [...] "is out there somewhere, chilling". Trainor described the EP as having a [...] "doo-wop feel" [...] reminiscent of [...] "All About That Bass," [...] but being different lyrically. Trainor noted that Title takes on themes that [...] "not {{a lot of people think}} about," [...] such as commitment and staying true to one's self. The EP was Epic Records' idea to prove that Trainor was not a one-hit wonder, following the success of her debut single, [...] "All About That Bass". In an interview with James Sullivan of The Boston Globe, the singer said that Title focuses on [...] "an awkward 19-, 20-year-old, when you're pretty sure you're an adult but you're not, yet." [...] She went on to add, [...] "All the songs sound very similar—very personal, girl power anthems." [...] Trainor felt the EP's album tracks showcased her better than what [...] "All About That Bass" [...] did.|$|E
2500|$|A {{pivotal moment}} {{in her life}} came during the summer before her sophomore year, when she went with a friend to the Gonzaga University girls' {{basketball}} camp. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> about the trip in 2011, [...] "I just {{fell in love with}} this place. I felt so comfortable here." [...] The Gonzaga women's basketball staff was equally enthusiastic about her, except for head coach Kelly Graves, who had little opportunity to see her during the camp. Graves would finally get to see Vandersloot at length in her junior year, on the day before the 2006 Washington Class 4A state tournament. He offered her a scholarship after seeing her practice, even though he did not stay for the tournament.|$|E

5|$|Mary Dudley {{said that}} if this were not true, I might be sure <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> {{such a thing as}} it might cost her her life and she was acting now with the Queen's consent, but <b>she</b> (the Queen) <b>would</b> not speak to the Emperor's {{ambassador}} about it.|$|R
2500|$|I {{had written}} long-form before {{but it is}} pure story-telling in script writing and that goes {{back as far as}} I can {{remember}} for me, not just with my father but with myself. I slept in the same bedroom as my sister for many years, until it became indecent to do so and I would tell her stories every night—that is how she would get to sleep. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> [...] "tell me a story" [...] so I would tell her a story. So that ability, I very much had that from the start and I used to enjoy that at school so actually to write a script—it suddenly felt like I was just making up a big story.|$|E
2500|$|Locke became {{convinced}} that the New Zealand Communist Party should develop a more [...] "home-grown ideology". At the same time, she was an internationalist, and it was this, according to the New Zealand Journal of History, [...] "that drew her into the Communist Party and ultimately made her leave it, in 1956". Locke, like many others, left in protest both over the Soviet response to the Hungarian Revolution, and the [...] "excesses" [...] of Stalinism. However, her husband Jack remained a communist until his death. After leaving the party, Elsie did not like {{her role in the}} Communist Party highlighted because, while the couple had [...] "agreed to disagree" [...] on political issues, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that the publicity [...] "upsets Jack".|$|E
2500|$|In early June 1944, Browder {{gave in to}} Akhmerov's {{demands and}} agreed to {{instruct}} the Silvermaster group to report directly to the NKGB. After her defection, Bentley would describe this as the event that turned her against Communism. [...] "I discovered then that Earl Browder was just a puppet, that somebody pulled the strings in Moscow," [...] <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>say.</b> Her biographers suggest that Bentley's objections, rather than being ideological, were more a lifelong dislike for being given orders and {{a sense that the}} reassignments left her with no meaningful role. Late in 1944 Bentley was ordered to give up all of her remaining sources, including the Perlo group she had recently acquired. Her Soviet superior also told her she would have to leave her position as vice president of U.S. Service and Shipping.|$|E

Although <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> anything more to Dora about that important piece of work, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> do it all the same.|$|R
2500|$|Piaf's mother {{abandoned}} her at birth, and she {{lived for a}} short time with her maternal grandmother, Emma (Aïcha). When her father enlisted with the French Army in 1916 to fight in World War I, he took her to his mother, who ran a brothel in Bernay, Normandy. There, prostitutes helped look after Piaf. The bordello had two floors and seven rooms, and the prostitutes were not very numerous, [...] "about ten poor girls" [...] as she later described, in fact five or six were permanent and a dozen for market and any busy days. The sub-mistress of the brothel, [...] "Madam Gaby" [...] could be considered a little like family since she became godmother of Denise Gassion, the half-sister born in 1931. Edith believed her weakness for men came from mixing with prostitutes in her grandmother's brothel. [...] "I thought that when a boy called a girl, the girl would never refuse" [...] <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> later.|$|E
2500|$|Jobs {{would later}} credit his fourth grade teacher, Imogene 'Teddy' Hill, with turning him around: [...] "She taught an {{advanced}} fourth grade class {{and it took}} her about a month to get hip to my situation. She bribed me into learning. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> 'I really want you to finish this workbook. I'll give you five bucks if you finish it.' That really kindled a passion in me for learning things! I learned more that year than I think I learned in any other year in school. They wanted me to skip {{the next two years}} in grade school and go straight to junior high to learn a foreign language but my parents very wisely wouldn't let it happen." [...] Jobs skipped the fifth grade and transferred to the sixth grade at Crittenden Middle School in Mountain View where he became a [...] "socially awkward loner." [...] Jobs [...] "was often bullied" [...] and gave his parents an ultimatum: they had to either take him out of Crittenden or he would drop out of school.|$|E
2500|$|On May 28, Minogue's 45th birthday, she {{announced}} the buzz single [...] "Skirt", {{and it was}} made available on Beatport on June 24. Whilst the track attracted positive commentary from critics, mainly for Minogue's newly experimented sound of electronic dance music, she revealed {{that it would not}} feature on the then-upcoming studio album. In February 2014, Minogue confirmed Furler as the album's executive co-producer's. Minogue stated in an interview with American website Idolator that [...] "I got on with her so well... I asked her if she would executive-produce. I was hoping <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> yes. I didn’t know if it was something she had done or was interested in, or if maybe she just preferred writing and doing her own music." [...] That same month, she commented to American Billboard magazine; [...] "I felt like I needed a new landscape, and once you've got your feet on the ground you're raring to go. [...] So far the support has been great, and it's just another part of this amalgamation of 'new' that I had wished for and was struck by." ...|$|E
