She appeared in the 1941 horror film Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and her reputation as a glamorous femme fatale was enhanced by her performance in the film noir The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946). Her popularity continued through the 1950s in <b>such</b> <b>films</b> <b>as</b> The Bad and the Beautiful (1952) and Peyton Place (1957), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress.|$|E
5|$|Ebert {{occasionally}} accused some {{films of}} having an unwholesome political agenda, such as claiming that the 1971 film Dirty Harry had a fascist moral position. He was wary of films passed off as art, but which he saw as lurid and sensational. He leveled this charge against <b>such</b> <b>films</b> <b>as</b> The Night Porter.|$|E
5|$|Nick Stuart (April 10, 1904 - April 7, 1973) was an Austro-Hungarian-born American {{actor and}} bandleader. His career spanned five decades, {{during which he}} {{appeared}} in over 50 films, {{more than half of}} them features, as well as film shorts, serials, and even one television appearance. He rose to stardom in <b>such</b> <b>films</b> <b>as</b> Girls Gone Wild and Chasing Through Europe, prior to expanding his business interests by creating a talent agency, and a popular upscale club in Hollywood.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} is by Rolling Stone {{film critic}} Peter Travers, a voting {{member of the}} Golden Raspberry Awards Foundation. The book begins with selected quotes from the reviewers of <b>such</b> <b>films</b> <b>as</b> The Blue Lagoon, From Justin to Kelly, and Color of Night. The book also includes {{a brief history of}} the Golden Raspberry Awards. Wilson lists and discusses his picks of the 100 worst films of Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|Bold {{experiments}} in cinematic storytelling were sometimes attempted during the classic era: Lady in the Lake, for example, is shot entirely {{from the point}} of view of protagonist Philip Marlowe; the face of star (and director) Robert Montgomery is seen only in mirrors. The Chase (1946) takes oneirism and fatalism as the basis for its fantastical narrative system, redolent of certain horror stories, but with little precedent in the context of a putatively realistic genre. In their different ways, both Sunset Boulevard and D.O.A. are tales told by dead men. Latter-day noir has been in the forefront of structural experimentation in popular cinema, as exemplified by <b>such</b> <b>films</b> <b>as</b> Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, and Memento.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, Famous Players-Lasky {{president}} Jesse Lasky {{was looking}} for a new Production Editor in the story department of his studio and Thalberg suggested Hawks. Hawks accepted and was immediately put in charge of over 40 productions, including several literary acquisitions of stories by Joseph Conrad, Jack London and Zane Grey. Hawks worked on the scripts for all of the films produced, but he had his first official screenplay credit in 1924 on Tiger Love. Hawks was the Story Editor at Famous Players (later Paramount Pictures) for almost two years, occasionally editing <b>such</b> <b>films</b> <b>as</b> Heritage of the Desert.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{recognized}} as a national sex symbol, Kapadia was keen to avoid being stereotyped and expand her range of acting roles. She subsequently took on more serious parts {{in a range of}} film genres, from mainstream to parallel cinema, and received acclaim for her performances in <b>such</b> <b>films</b> <b>as</b> Kaash (1987), Drishti (1990), Lekin... (1990), and Rudaali (1993), which earned her a National Film Award for Best Actress and a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress. She followed with supporting roles in Gardish (1993) and Krantiveer (1994), the latter of which garnered her a fourth Filmfare Award.|$|E
5|$|Ryder {{had hoped}} to be a fashion designer, {{undertaking}} a course at Central Saint Martins {{which he did not}} complete; from there he worked in retail, first for Prowler and then for the designer Vivienne Westwood. Subsequently, appearing in gay pornography as a twink bottom for production companies like Eurocreme and UK Naked Men, he starred in <b>such</b> <b>films</b> <b>as</b> Drunk on Spunk and Stretch that Hole, winning numerous awards for his work. By the time he made Uncle David, he was also running his own weekly gay wrestling night in London.|$|E
5|$|Since then, interpretations in {{successive}} eras {{have reflected}} the sensibilities of the time. Goya {{was seen as}} a proto-Romantic in the early 19th century, and the series' graphically rendered dismembered carcasses were a direct influence on Théodore Géricault, best known for the politically charged Raft of the Medusa (1818–19). Luis Buñuel identified with Goya's sense of the absurd, and referenced his works in <b>such</b> <b>films</b> <b>as</b> the 1930 L'Âge d'Or, on which he collaborated with Salvador Dalí, and his 1962 The Exterminating Angel.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} success of Kedok Ketawa, Saeroen joined Union Films and wrote four films for the company. These were not {{directed}} by Jo An Djan, who left Union for the competitor Populair's Film, but by the newly hired R Hu and Rd Ariffien. Union Film ultimately produced a total of seven films in 1940 and 1941 before being closed following the Japanese invasion in early 1942. Of the film's main cast, only Fatimah and Oedjang are recorded as continuing their acting career, both appearing in several further Union productions. However, in the 1950s Resobowo continued his career behind the screen, serving as art director of <b>such</b> <b>films</b> <b>as</b> Darah dan Doa (The Long March; 1950).|$|E
5|$|The film {{tells the}} story of a missing {{documentary}} film crew who had gone to the Amazon to film cannibal tribes. A rescue mission, led by the New York University anthropologist Harold Monroe, recovers the film crew's lost cans of film, which an American television station wishes to broadcast. Upon viewing the reels, Monroe is appalled by the team's actions, and after learning their fate, he objects to the station's intent to air the documentary. The presentation of the crew's lost footage, functioning similarly to a flashback, revolutionized the found footage style of narrative filmmaking, later popularized by <b>such</b> <b>films</b> <b>as</b> The Blair Witch Project.|$|E
5|$|The former Laverne & Shirley star Penny Marshall {{provided}} {{the voice of}} Ms. Botz. The episode features cultural references to <b>such</b> <b>films</b> <b>as</b> The Night of the Hunter and Psycho {{as well as a}} musical reference to A Star Is Born. Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics; some deemed it the best episode of the season while others regarded it as the weakest. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 15.4, and was the highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.|$|E
50|$|Smith {{moved in}} 1947 to Hollywood, {{where he worked}} in the film industry, first for Samuel Goldwyn as a script editor. In 1950, he became an {{independent}} producer, producing <b>such</b> Hollywood <b>films</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Elmer Gantry and How the West was Won. In 1963 he partnered as a producer with director John Ford, making <b>films</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Cheyenne Autumn.|$|R
50|$|After {{her first}} short {{role in the}} film Gejje Pooje (1969), Aarathi went on to star as a leading actress in many {{successful}} <b>films</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Naagarahaavu, Edakallu Guddada Mele, Bili Hendthi, Dharmasere, Paduvaaralli Pandavaru, Ranganayaki, Hombisilu, Upaasane and Shubhamangala. Apart from Kannada, she also appeared in Tamil <b>films</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Gumasthavin Magal and Telugu <b>films</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Vooriki Upakari.|$|R
50|$|He {{directed}} <b>films</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Crimen a las tres in 1935 {{and wrote}} for <b>films</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Allá en el Norte in 1973. He {{retired from the}} industry in 1979.|$|R
5|$|The {{story was}} {{inspired}} by Florey's own experiences in Hollywood, {{as well as the}} George Gershwin composition Rhapsody in Blue. It {{was one of the first}} films shot by Gregg Toland, who later received acclaim for his work on <b>such</b> <b>films</b> <b>as</b> The Grapes of Wrath (1939) and Citizen Kane (1941). The film serves as a satire of the social conditions, dominant practices, and ideologies of Hollywood, as well as the film industry's perceived mistreatment of actors. Douglas Fairbanks assisted with the development of the film, and Charlie Chaplin and Joseph M. Schenck helped promote it.|$|E
5|$|Americans' mistrust and {{dislike of}} lawyers was a {{frequent}} topic of dissection in social problem films such Lawyer Man (1933), State's Attorney, and The Mouthpiece (1932). In films such as Paid (1930), the legal system turns innocent characters into criminals. The life of Joan Crawford's character is ruined and her romantic interest is executed so that she may live free, although she is innocent of the crime for which the district attorney wants to convict her. Religious hypocrisy was addressed in <b>such</b> <b>films</b> <b>as</b> The Miracle Woman (1931), starring Barbara Stanwyck and directed by Frank Capra. Stanwyck also portrayed a nurse and initially reluctant heroine who manages to save, via unorthodox means, two young children in danger from nefarious characters (including Clark Gable as a malevolent chauffeur) in Night Nurse (1931).|$|E
5|$|Among big-budget auteurs, Michael Mann {{has worked}} {{frequently}} in a neo-noir mode, with <b>such</b> <b>films</b> <b>as</b> Thief (1981) and Heat (1995) and the TV series Miami Vice (1984–89) and Crime Story (1986–88). Mann's output exemplifies a primary strain of neo-noir, in which classic themes and tropes are revisited in a contemporary setting with an up-to-date visual style and rock- or hip hop–based musical soundtrack. Like Chinatown, its more complex predecessor, Curtis Hanson's Oscar-winning L.A. Confidential (1997), {{based on the}} James Ellroy novel, demonstrates an opposite tendency—the deliberately retro film noir; its tale of corrupt cops and femmes fatales is seemingly lifted straight from a film of 1953, {{the year in which}} it is set. Director David Fincher followed the immensely successful neo-noir Seven (1995) with a film that developed into a cult favorite after its original, disappointing release: Fight Club (1999) is a sui generis mix of noir aesthetic, perverse comedy, speculative content, and satiric intent.|$|E

5|$|At sixteen, Beckman won a {{modeling}} {{competition at}} her local skating rink. Around 1999, {{she moved to}} Los Angeles, California to become a professional model and actress. She studied Theater Arts at Santa Monica College and had on-camera acting and Meisner technique training at The Piero Dusa Acting Studio. It was during this time that Beckman adopted her middle name Michelle as her working last name. She appeared in numerous bodybuilding and car magazines such as FLEX and Lowrider Magazine, {{as well as being}} named Cyber Girl of the Week in the June 2002 issue of Playboy. Beckman also made appearances on television programs such as Party of Five, 7th Heaven and Hotel Erotica, as well as appearing in <b>such</b> <b>films</b> <b>as</b> Tomcats, Anger Management, DodgeBall and A Man Apart.|$|E
5|$|Howard Peck, {{an animal}} trainer, brought the eight-month-old collie to Hollywood animal trainer Rudd Weatherwax {{in order to}} break the animal of {{uncontrolled}} barking and a habit of chasing motorcycles. After working with the dog, Weatherwax gained control of the barking {{but was unable to}} break Pal of his motorcycle-chasing habit. Peck was disappointed with the results and gave the dog to Weatherwax in exchange for the money Peck owed him. Weatherwax, in turn, gave the dog to a friend, but when he learned that Eric Knight's 1940 novel, Lassie Come-Home, was being considered as a feature film by MGM, Weatherwax sensed Pal was the dog to fill the role, and bought Pal back from his friend for $10.00 USD. Peck later tried to reclaim him after he became famous as Lassie, but Weatherwax's legal ownership was upheld. Rudd's brother Frank Weatherwax, who trained dogs for <b>such</b> <b>films</b> <b>as</b> The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T and The Wizard of Oz, assisted Rudd in training Pal.|$|E
5|$|Joanne Whalley, {{who played}} Emma Craven, began acting during childhood, {{appearing}} in the long-running soap opera Coronation Street (1960–present) in 1976 {{at the age of}} 10. She had also appeared in supporting roles in several series including Juliet Bravo (1980–1985), Bergerac (1981–1991) and Reilly, Ace of Spies (1983). Following Edge of Darkness, Whalley was cast in the equally well regarded BBC television serial The Singing Detective (1986), written by Dennis Potter. Moving to Hollywood, she appeared in <b>such</b> <b>films</b> <b>as</b> Willow (1988), Scandal (1989) and Shattered (1991) as well as television mini-series such as Scarlett (1994) and Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis (2000).
