He knew well {{what she meant}} by pitying her for what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> got. What <b>had</b> <b>she</b> <b>lost?</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> him. Did <b>she</b> intend to evoke his pity for that loss? <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> him. Yes, indeed. Whether or no the loss was one to regret, he would not say to himself; or rather, he, of course, {{declared}} that it was not; but such as it was, it had been incurred. He was now the property of Florence Burton, and, whatever happened, he would be true to her.|$|R

She eventually commits suicide by stepping out in front of a bus, but only Callum knows that it was not an accident.|$|E
25|$|Relativity and {{ambiguity}} {{are prominent}} {{ideas in the}} play, and the audience is challenged to come to conclusions about the ambivalent nature {{of many of the}} characters. The relationship between Antony and Cleopatra can easily be read as one of love or lust; their passion can be construed as being wholly destructive but also showing elements of transcendence. Cleopatra might be said to kill herself out of love for Antony, or because <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>lost</b> political power. Octavius can be seen as either a noble and good ruler, only wanting what is right for Rome, or as a cruel and ruthless politician.|$|E

60|$|IRENE did {{not leave}} her mother in any {{illusion}} concerning her cousin Will and herself. <b>She</b> said they <b>had</b> all been as nice to her as they could be, and when Mrs. Lapham hinted at what had been in her thoughts,--or her hopes, rather,--Irene severely snubbed the notion. She {{said that he was}} as good as engaged to a girl out there, and that he had never dreamt of her. Her mother wondered at her severity; in these few months the girl had toughened and hardened; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> all her babyish dependence and pliability; she was like iron; and here and there she was sharpened to a cutting edge. It had been a life and death struggle with her; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> conquered, but <b>she</b> <b>had</b> also necessarily <b>lost</b> much. Perhaps what <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> was not worth keeping; but at any rate <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> it.|$|R
25|$|The {{people and}} warriors in Arindal's capital are panicking {{because they are}} under attack. Lora berates them, saying that she herself stands firm even though <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>lost</b> father, brother and lover. She reminds them of Groma's prophecy that the kingdom will not fall if Arindal returns, but the chorus express doubts. Just as she begins to fear that they are right (O musst du Hoffnung schwinden), a {{messenger}} arrives to announce that Arindal is on his way. The new king is greeted joyously by his people, but Arindal himself expresses his fears {{that he is not}} strong enough for battle. Meanwhile, Morald and Lora express their mutual love.|$|E
25|$|Marcello, Schaunard and Colline go out, but Rodolfo remains {{alone for}} a moment in order to finish an article he is writing, {{promising}} to join his friends soon. There is a knock at the door. It is a girl who lives in another room in the building. Her candle has blown out, and she has no matches; she asks Rodolfo to light it. She is briefly overcome with faintness, and Rodolfo helps her to a chair and offers her a glass of wine. She thanks him. After a few minutes, she says that she is better and must go. But as she turns to leave, she realizes that <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>lost</b> her key.|$|E
25|$|At the Open GDF Suez in Paris, Hantuchová beat Ekaterina Makarova in {{the first}} round, before losing to Cornet in the second round. This was the third {{consecutive}} time <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>lost</b> to Cornet. Hantuchová then played in the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships, where she lost to eventual runner-up Virginie Razzano in the third round. Because of her results at this tournament, Hantuchová's ranking improved five places to world No. 36. At the BNP Paribas Open, Hantuchová was the only two-time singles champion in the draw. Seeded 30th, Hantuchová fell to Sybille Bammer in the fourth round, 3–6, 2–6. Unseeded {{for the first time}} since 2001 at the Sony Ericsson Open, Hantuchová lost to 22nd-seeded Anna Chakvetadze in the second round, 3–6, 1–6.|$|E

25|$|Scholars have {{additionally}} {{debated the}} nature of the character Beloved, arguing whether she is actually a ghost or a real person. Numerous reviews, assuming Beloved to be a supernatural incarnation of Sethe’s daughter, have subsequently faulted Beloved as an unconvincing and confusing ghost story. Elizabeth B. House, however, has argued that Beloved is not a ghost, and the novel is actually a story of two probable instances of mistaken identity. Beloved is haunted by the loss of her African parents and thus comes to believe that Sethe is her mother. Sethe longs for her dead daughter and is rather easily convinced that Beloved is the child <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>lost.</b> Such an interpretation, House contends, clears up many puzzling aspects of the novel and emphasizes Morrison’s concern with familial ties.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Family {{continue}} on their way, fleeing to a hidden Kingdom despite the Baker's pleas {{for them to}} stay and fight the Giant. The Witch declares she will find Jack and sacrifice him to the Giant, and the Baker and his Wife decide they must find him first and split up to search. The Baker's Wife meets Cinderella's Prince, and he easily seduces the Wife ("Any Moment"). Meanwhile, the Baker discovers Cinderella at her mother's destroyed grave and convinces her to join their group for safety. The Prince, satisfied, leaves the Baker's Wife with a few platitudes, and she realizes her error and decides {{to return to her}} happy life with the Baker and their son ("Moments in the Woods"). However, <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>lost</b> her way, stumbles into the path of the Giant, and is consequently killed by a falling tree.|$|E
25|$|At the Australian Open, she was seeded seventh. In {{the fourth}} round against ninth seed Vera Zvonareva she rallied to win, but lost to Serena Williams in the quarterfinal. Azarenka was up a set and four games before Williams {{came back to}} win in three sets. This was the third {{consecutive}} year <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>lost</b> to Williams at this tournament. Seeded fourth at the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships, {{on her way to}} the final, she defeated Vera Zvonareva in the quarterfinals and Agnieszka Radwańska in the semifinals. In the final, she lost to defending champion Venus Williams. At the 2010 BNP Paribas Open, she was seeded third, but was upset in the third round by María José Martínez Sánchez. At the 2010 Sony Ericsson Open, where she was the defending champion and fourth seed, she lost in fourth round to 14th seed and eventual champion Kim Clijsters.

25|$|The king, too, {{falls in}} love with Imoinda. He gives her the sacred veil, thus {{commanding}} her to become one of his wives, even though she has already married Oroonoko. After unwillingly spending time in the king's harem (the Otan), Imoinda and Oroonoko plan a tryst {{with the help of the}} sympathetic Onahal and Aboan. They are eventually discovered, and because <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>lost</b> her virginity, Imoinda is sold as a slave. The king’s guilt, however, leads him to falsely inform Oroonoko that she has been executed, since death was thought to be better than slavery. Later, after winning another tribal war, Oroonoko is betrayed and captured by an English captain, who plans to sell him and his men as slaves. Both Imoinda and Oroonoko are carried to Surinam, at that time an English colony based on sugarcane plantation in the West Indies. The two lovers are reunited there, under the new Christian names of Caesar and Clemene, even though Imoinda's beauty has attracted the unwanted desires of other slaves and of the Cornish gentleman, Trefry.|$|E
500|$|... "Bad Timing" [...] is the forty-ninth episode {{from the}} fifth season of Adventure Time, an {{animated}} television series.

500|$|Bolkovac {{is portrayed}} as imperfect—a [...] "noble but screwed up" [...] individual.

While there, she has {{an affair with a}} fellow peacekeeper. Kondracki wanted to promote the idea of an average protagonist who acted against injustice while her peers looked the other way. Her flaws are offset by her determination to fight the sex trade, and reviewers found these aspects instrumental in making her a three-dimensional character.|$|E

Mary falls foul of Mary de Putron, the aggressive and authoritarian college games captain; [...] in the hockey trials de Putron makes Mary [...] play out of her normal position, so that performs badly. [...] Hilary subsequently avenges Mary's humiliation by seducing de Putron's boyfriend, a gauche Royal Air Force officer called Clive, whom she then dumps unceremoniously.|$|E
