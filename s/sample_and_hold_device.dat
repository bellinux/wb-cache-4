This performance criterion is a generalisation of the well known H 1 norm criterion used in the frequency domain for analysis and synthesis of linear time invariant control systems. A number of different time varying system frameworks are considered, for which there are no frequency domain counterparts. One such class is that of aperiodic sampleddata systems, that is continuous time systems connected to a discrete controller via <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>devices.</b> Multiple generalized <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>devices,</b> which may be aperiodic and asynchronous, are permitted within the framework considered in this thesis.

The basic sampling criterion operates {{in the sense that}} each next sampling occurs when the absolute difference of the signal amplitude with respect to its currently sampled signal equalizes a prescribed threshold amplitude.

The limit oscillations might be interpreted through the equivalence of the adaptive <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>device</b> with a nonlinear one consisting of a relay with multiple hysteresis whose parameterization is, in general, dependent on the initial conditions of the dynamic system.

We propose a method for obtaining a low-order discrete-time controller which makes small the approximation error based on recasting the approximation problem as a four-block H∞ problem.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis is to develop {{computationally}} efficient methods for stability analysis and controller synthesis of sampled-data networked control systems. In sampled-data networked control systems, the sensory information and feedback signals are exchanged among different components of the system (sensors, actuators, and controllers) through a communication network. Stabilization of sampled-data networked control systems is a challenging problem since the introduction of multirate <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> <b>holds,</b> time-delays, <b>and</b> packet losses into the system degrades its performance {{and can lead to}} instability. A diverse range of systems with linear, piecewise affine (PWA), and nonlinear vector fields are studied in this thesis. PWA systems are a class of state-based switched systems with affine vector field in each mode. Stabilization of PWA networked control systems are even more challenging since they simultaneously involve switches due to the hybrid vector fields (state-based switching) and switches due to the <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>devices</b> in the network (event-based switching). The objectives of this thesis are: (a) to design controllers that guarantee exponential stability of the system for a desired sampling period; (b) to design observers that guarantee exponential convergence of the estimation error to the origin for a desired <b>sampling</b> period; <b>and</b> (c) given a controller, to find the maximum allowable network-induced delay that guarantees exponential stability of the sampled-data networked control system. Lyapunov-Krasovskii based approaches are used to propose sufficient stability and stabilization conditions for sampled-data networked control systems. Convex relaxation techniques are employed to cast the proposed stability analysis and controller synthesis criteria in terms of linear matrix inequalities that can be solved efficiently...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid Continuous/Discrete Time Systems are {{systems in}} which one part evolves in {{continuous}} time and another in discrete time. Important examples of such systems are digital (sampled-data) control systems, in which a continuous time plant is controlled by a digital controller using <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>devices.</b> Traditionally, such systems have been discretized and treated as discrete-time systems thereby ignoring their continuous time (or inter-sample) behavior. The traditional approach is not applicable in modern theories of robust control such as H∞ or ℓ 1, where for continuous time plants it is more natural that plant and signal uncertainties are given in continuous time. Therefore, to pose robust control problems with sampled-data controllers, one needs to consider the continuous time behavior of these systems. The continuous time behavior of sampled-data systems is in general periodically time varying. A new framework is developed for continuous-time periodic systems which has many of the useful qualities of the time invariant theory such as transforms and constant state space realizations. The framework {{is based on a}} lifting technique which establishes a strong correspondence between periodically time-varying systems in continuous time, and certain types of infinite dimensional time-invariant systems in discrete time. The utility of this framework is shown by posing and providing exact and constructive solutions to both the H∞ and the ℓ 1 sampled-data control problems, where the performance specifications are given in terms of continuous time uncertainties. A natural generalization is given for the H 2 problem in the case of time-varying systems. This is used to pose the H 2 problem for sampled-data systems, and a complete solution is also obtained...|$|R

40|$|Continuous-time {{systems are}} usually {{modelled}} by differential equations arising from physical laws. However, {{the use of}} these models in practice requires discretisation. In this thesis we consider sampled-data models for linear and nonlinear systems. We study some of the issues involved in the sampling process, such as the accuracy of the sampled-data models, the artifacts produced by the particular <b>sampling</b> scheme, <b>and</b> the relations to the underlying continuous-time system. We review, extend and present new results, making extensive use of the delta operator which allows a clearer connection between a sampled-data model and the underlying continuous-time system. In {{the first part of the}} thesis we consider sampled-data models for linear systems. In this case exact discrete-time representations can be obtained. These models depend, not only on the continuous-time system, but also on the artifacts involved in the sampling process, namely, the <b>sample</b> <b>and</b> <b>hold</b> <b>devices.</b> In particular, these devices play a key role in determining the sampling zeros of the discrete-time model. We consider robustness issues associated with the use of discrete-time models for continuous-time system identification from sampled data. We show that, by using restricted bandwidth frequency domain maximum likelihood estimation, the identification results are robust to (possible) under-modelling due to the sampling process. Sampled-data models provide a powerful tool also for continuous-time optimal control problems, where the presence of constraints can make the explicit solution impossible to find. We show how this solution can be arbitrarily approximated by an associated sampled-data problem using fast sampling rates. We also show that there is a natural convergence of the singular structure of the optimal control problem from discrete- to continuous-time, as the sampling period goes to zero. In Part II we consider sampled-data models for nonlinear systems. In this case we can only obtain approximate sampled-data models. These discrete-time models are simple and accurate in a well defined sense. For deterministic systems, an insightful observation is that the proposed model contains sampling zero dynamics. Moreover, these correspond to the same dynamics associated with the asymptotic sampling zeros in the linear case. The topics and results presented in the thesis are believed to give important insights into the use of sampled-data models to represent linear and nonlinear continuous-time systems.
