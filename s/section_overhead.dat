50|$|Traditional regenerators {{terminate}} the <b>section</b> <b>overhead,</b> {{but not the}} line or path.

50|$|The first 36 bytes of each row of a frame (with the {{exception}} of row 16) contain a <b>Section</b> <b>OverHead.</b> The first 36 bytes of row 16 contain the AU pointer (payload address). The field consisting of 261X36 bytes is for payload transmission (The STM payload {{is known as the}} Virtual Container (VC) and consists of the actual payload, known as the Container (C) and additional overhead known as Path Over Head (POH), for path related information).|$|E
50|$|The Synchronous Transport Module, level 1 (STM-1) {{frame is}} the basic {{transmission}} format for SDH—the first level of the synchronous digital hierarchy. The STM-1 frame is transmitted in exactly 125 µs, therefore, there are 8,000 frames per second on a 155.52 Mbit/s OC-3 fiber-optic circuit. The STM-1 frame consists of overhead and pointers plus information payload. The first nine columns of each frame make up the <b>section</b> <b>overhead</b> and administrative unit pointers, and the last 261 columns make up the information payload. The pointers (H1, H2, H3 bytes) identify administrative units (AU) within the information payload. Thus, an OC-3 circuit can carry 150.336 Mbit/s of payload, after accounting for the overhead.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine how drawings for streets may be tailored to {{a broad range of}} viewers and agendas, yet still be viewed as a credible design tool for architects. With a growing number of cities designing their own guidelines according to the Complete Streets movements, it's necessary to develop a graphic style that not only appeals to the typical engineering aspect of streets, but is also robust enough to include details for various design components and spatial qualities not before considered in street design. New drawings and information graphics were invented to better describe multi-modal streets, spatial qualities, and a fully conceived taxonomy of urban street types. It was discovered that three drawing types are especially useful for conveying this type of information: Perspective- <b>Sections,</b> <b>Overhead</b> Views, and Transects. by James Ira Winder.

From the gotten results, it is clear that reasonably accurate modeling can be obtained by simulating the line by a very simple circuital approach...|$|R
50|$|A short Dolter {{system also}} opened in 1907 in Hastings along the seafront to connect two {{sections}} {{of a network}} that otherwise used overhead collection. It lasted until 1913.

50|$|A {{neutral section}} or phase break is used, {{consisting}} of two section breaks back-to-back with a short <b>section</b> of <b>overhead</b> line that belongs to neither grid. If the two grids are synchronised this stretch of line is energised (by either supply) and trains run through it normally. If the two supplies are not synchronised it is disconnected from the supplies, leaving it electrically dead, ensuring that the two grids cannot be connected to each other.|$|R

The Pre-Cast segments are joined together using high strength epoxy glue with nominal pre-stressing initially. The end segments adjacent to the pier are short segments [...] "cast-in-situ joints". Geometrical adjustments of the span are made before primary continuous tendons are stressed.|$|R

The RandstadRail metro line E uses third rail in the sections shared with Rotterdam metro trains, but mostly use <b>overhead</b> wires.
