Consequently, the firm will reportedly focus investment on sectors such as coffee and pet care and will seek acquisitions in the consumer health-care industry.|$|E
25|$|Capital {{budgeting}} is {{also concerned}} with the setting of criteria about which projects should receive investment funding to increase {{the value of the}} firm, and whether to finance that investment with equity or debt capital. Investments should be {{made on the basis of}} value-added to the future of the corporation. Projects that increase a firm's value may include a wide variety of different types of investments, including but not limited to, expansion policies, or mergers and acquisitions. When no growth or expansion is possible by a corporation and excess cash surplus exists and is not needed, then management is expected to pay out some or all of those surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends or to repurchase the company's stock through a <b>share</b> <b>buyback</b> program.|$|E
2500|$|Management {{must also}} choose {{the form of}} the {{dividend}} distribution, generally as cash dividends or via a <b>share</b> <b>buyback.</b> Various factors may be taken into consideration: where shareholders must pay tax on dividends, firms may elect to retain earnings or to perform a stock buyback, in both cases increasing the value of shares outstanding. Alternatively, some companies will pay [...] "dividends" [...] from stock rather than in cash; see Corporate action. [...] Financial theory suggests that the dividend policy should be set based upon the type of company and what management determines is the best use of those dividend resources for the firm to its shareholders. [...] As a general rule, shareholders of growth companies would prefer managers to retain earnings and pay no dividends (use excess cash to reinvest into the company's operations), whereas shareholders of value or secondary stocks would prefer the management of these companies to payout surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends when a positive return cannot be earned through the reinvestment of undistributed earnings. [...] A <b>share</b> <b>buyback</b> program may be accepted when the value of the stock is greater than the returns to be realized from the reinvestment of undistributed profits. [...] In all instances, the appropriate dividend policy is usually directed by that which maximizes long-term shareholder value.|$|E

The main prevalent hypothesis amongst scholars and practitioners is that <b>share</b> <b>buybacks</b> can substitute for dividend payouts as a means for companies to return capital to shareholders, possibly with a tax benefit to shareholders. This so-called substitution hypothesis is shown both theoretically and empirically to be a fallacy as <b>share</b> <b>buybacks</b> may significantly affect the value to shareholders. This is important because <b>share</b> <b>buybacks</b> are now substantially larger than dividend payouts in the aggregate, possibly {{as a result of the}} substitution hypothesis commonly believed to be valid. The paper also makes contributions to other areas of finance theory, including a new heuristic for selecting a discount rate for use in valuation, and a new method for estimating the long-term rate of return that can be expected from a stock market index. The theory is also applied to several case studies from the real world. 1 If you find any parts difficult to understand, or if you encounter any errors, be it logical, mathematical, spelling, grammatical or otherwise, please mark the document and e-mail it to: Magnus (at) Hvass-Labs (dot) Org...|$|R

2500|$|Dividend {{policy is}} {{concerned}} with financial policies regarding the payment of a cash dividend in the present or paying an increased dividend at a later stage. [...] Whether to issue dividends, and what amount, is determined mainly {{on the basis of}} the company's unappropriated profit (excess cash) and influenced by the company's long-term earning power. When cash surplus exists and is not needed by the firm, then management is expected to pay out some or all of those surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends or to repurchase the company's stock through a <b>share</b> <b>buyback</b> program.|$|E
2500|$|The {{market for}} {{corporate}} control, where parties compete to buy controlling stakes in companies, {{is seen by}} some as an important, although perhaps limited, mechanism for the board of directors' accountability. Because individual shareholders {{may not be as}} likely to act collectively as a majority shareholder, the threat of a takeover when a company share price drops, heightens the prospect that a director is removed from office by an ordinary resolution under CA 2006 section 168. Since 1959 the UK has taken the approach that directors, particularly of public companies, should do nothing with the effect of frustrating a takeover bid, unless shareholders approve it by a majority {{at the time of the}} takeover. Rule 21 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers consolidates this now. Typical takeover defence tactics, routinely found in US corporate law, led by Delaware, include issuing extra shares to everyone but a takeover bidder to dilute their stake unless the bidder has the board's consent to buy shareholders' shares (a [...] "poison pill"), paying a takeover bidder to go away ("greenmail"), merely selling a key company asset to a friendly third party, or engaging in large <b>share</b> <b>buyback</b> schemes. In the US, defensive tactics must merely be employed in good faith, and be proportionate to the threat posed with regard to factors like the offer price, timing and effect on the company's stakeholders. Moreover, Delaware directors can often only be removed for a [...] "good reason" [...] (fought out in court) with a board classified into directors a third of whom will be removable in any given year. This makes hostile takeovers very difficult, unless a bidder promises the incumbent board large golden parachutes in return for their consent. After much debate, the EU's newly implemented Takeover Directive decided to leave member states the option under articles 9 and 12 of whether to mandate that boards remain [...] "neutral".|$|E

50|$|Trevor v Whitworth (1887) 12 App Cas 409 is a UK {{company law}} case {{concerning}} <b>share</b> <b>buybacks.</b> It held they were unlawful. The case {{is often used}} in support for the Capital Maintenance Rule.The rule coming from the case itself has since been reformed by statute in several commonwealth countries. In the UK, the rule was reformed in 1980 and replaced with a statutory procedure so that shares can either be classed as redeemable or be bought back, under the Companies Act 2006 sections 684-723.

50|$|Company {{executive}} compensation is often affected by <b>share</b> <b>buybacks.</b> Part of their rewards may {{be tied to}} their ability to meet earnings per share targets. Moreover, all <b>share</b> <b>buybacks</b> enhance the value of promised shares in their share incentive schemes. Bhargava (2013) reports that stock options exercised by top executives increase future share repurchases by US firms. Higher share repurchases, in turn, significantly lowered the research and development expenditures that are important for raising productivity. Further, increasing earnings per share does not equate to increases in shareholder value. This investment ratio is influenced by accounting policy choices and fails {{to take into account the}} cost of capital and future cash flows which are the determinants of shareholder value.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} motives behind <b>share</b> <b>buybacks</b> in the UK, and {{examines}} {{this form of}} corporate payout in relation to dividends by extending traditional corporate dividend behaviour models to include payouts made through share repurchases. Using hand-collected data for 267 firms belonging to the FTSE 350 from 2001 to 2004, we show that the motives of firms in the UK to repurchase their shares appear {{to be different from}} those of US firms, which we mainly attribute to differences in corporate governance between the two countries. We find that the most plausible motive behind <b>share</b> <b>buybacks</b> in the UK is the distribution of surplus cash to shareholders although, contrary to US findings, UK <b>share</b> <b>buybacks</b> are related primarily to expected rather than unexpected earnings. Indeed, <b>share</b> <b>buybacks</b> appear to be paid out of the same expected earnings component as are dividends, which suggests that repurchases may be substitutes for (at least part of) regular dividend payouts. When we use behavioural dividend models, such as Lintner (1956) and Fama & Babiak (1968), to determine whether they can be extended to estimate changes in total payouts as opposed to just dividends, we find that firms that repurchase their shares tend to have a smoother dividend policy, which lends support to the substitution hypothesis of share repurchases. Further, we develop modified versions of these models in which we assume that dividends or total payout changes are the result of a full adjustment to expected changes in earnings and a partial adjustment to unexpected changes in earnings. We show that these models appear to better reflect the changes in total payout policy that have occurred in recent years in the UK. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

One advantage of using data from Hong Kong is that details of actual share repurchases are disclosed. Our results suggest that firms initiating share repurchases have surplus cash and are undervalued. Furthermore, the number of shares repurchased in a quarter {{is a function of}} the cash flow of the firm, undervaluation and the number of shares repurchased in the prior period. We find that market-adjusted stock returns surrounding the first share repurchase are a function of undervaluation, as proxied by prior abnormal stock returns, and the number of shares acquired. The general tenor of the results is consistent with the hypotheses that managers engage in <b>share</b> <b>buybacks</b> to return ‚Äòsurplus‚Äô cash to shareholders and to signal and correct undervaluation.
