5|$|British {{officials}} filed two lawsuits {{stemming from}} the Liberty incident: an in rem suit against the ship, and an in personam suit against Hancock. Royal officials, as well as Hancock's accuser, stood to gain financially, since, as was the custom, any penalties assessed by the court would be awarded to the governor, the informer, and the Crown, each getting a third. The first <b>suit,</b> <b>filed</b> on June 22, 1768, resulted in the confiscation of the Liberty in August. Customs officials then used the ship to enforce trade regulations until it was burned by angry colonists in Rhode Island the following year.|$|E
5|$|In 1868 President Ulysses S. Grant {{appointed}} Harrison {{to represent}} {{the federal government in}} a civil <b>suit</b> <b>filed</b> by Lambdin P. Milligan, whose controversial wartime conviction for treason in 1864 led to the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case known as Ex parte Milligan. The civil case was referred to the U.S. Circuit Court for Indiana at Indianapolis, where it evolved into Milligan v. Hovey. Although the jury rendered a verdict in Milligan's favor and he had sought {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} in damages, state and federal statutes limited the amount the federal government had to award to Milligan to five dollars plus court costs.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why Burt made such an unusual will, but {{newspaper}} records suggest family feuds were likely {{at the core of}} his decision. The will was challenged by his children after he died. A legal hole was found in 1920 because part of the estate was composed of iron leases in Minnesota, and Minnesota had a law against trusts of such long standing. This portion of the estate, amounting to $5 million, was distributed to Burt's children and grandchildren (a son, three daughters and four granddaughters). In 1961, an additional $720,000 was taken from the trust in settlement of a <b>suit</b> <b>filed</b> by nine heirs and the estates of three other descendants.|$|E

5|$|From a {{historical}} perspective, however, Robertson's most important contribution was made {{not on a}} basketball court, but rather {{in a court of}} law. It was the year of the landmark Robertson v. National Basketball Ass'n, an antitrust <b>suit</b> <b>filed</b> by the NBA's Players Association against the league. As Robertson was the president of the Players Association, the case bore his name. In this suit, the proposed merger between the NBA and American Basketball Association was delayed until 1976, and the college draft as well as the free agency clauses were reformed. Robertson himself stated that the main reason was that clubs basically owned their players: players were forbidden to talk to other clubs once their contract was up, because free agency did not exist back then. Six years after the suit was filed, the NBA finally reached a settlement, the ABA–NBA merger took place, and the Oscar Robertson suit encouraged signing of more free agents and eventually led to higher salaries for all players.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately decided {{under the}} title O'Grady v. Superior Court, the <b>suit</b> <b>filed</b> by Apple against unnamed bloggers raised the issue {{for the first time}} of whether bloggers hold the same protections against {{revealing}} sources that journalists have. In November 2004, three popular weblog sites featuring Apple rumors publicly revealed information about two unreleased Apple products, the Mac mini and an as yet unreleased product code-named Asteroid, also known as Project Q97. Apple subpoenaed three sites to force them to identify their confidential sources: Apple Insider, Power Page, and, separately, Think Secret, which did no original reporting on the case and thus had no sources to reveal. In February 2005, a trial court in California decided that website operators {{do not have the same}} shield law protection as do other journalists. The journalists appealed and, in May 2006, the California Court of Appeal reversed the trial court's decision, ruling that activities in question were covered by the shield law.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} {{elections}} of 1967, Reddy {{was elected to}} the Lok Sabha from Hindupur in Andhra Pradesh. On 17 March 1967, Reddy was elected Speaker of the Fourth Lok Sabha becoming only the third person to be elected Speaker of the house during their inaugural term. To emphasize the independence of the Speaker's office, Reddy resigned from the Congress Party. His term as Speaker was marked by several firsts including the admission of a No-Confidence Motion on the same day as the President's address to a joint session of Parliament, the handing down of a sentence of imprisonment for Contempt {{of the house and the}} setting up of the Committee on the Welfare of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. During his term as Speaker a defamation <b>suit</b> <b>filed</b> against him by an MP resulted in the Supreme Court's ruling that parliamentarians had complete freedom of speech in the House and that the courts had no say in such matters. Reddy described his role as being the 'watchman of the Parliament'. He however had several hostile encounters with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the House that proved costly when he became, two years later, the Congress Party's nominee to succeed Zakir Hussain as President.|$|E

40|$|Conclusion Recent {{years have}} seen a precipitous {{increase}} {{in the incidence of}} medical malpractice litigation.

Although many of the <b>suits</b> <b>filed</b> have some legitimate basis, physicians and their insurance carriers have noted a rise in the number of actions filed that lack substantial merit. To counteract these nonmeritorious claims, physicians have sought recourse through countersuits. Physician countersuits have been conspicuously, although not uniformly, unsuccessful. Countersuits for abuse of process, malicious prosecution, intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation, barratry, and negligence have been consistently rejected by the courts for numerou...|$|R

40|$|In {{the writing}} and {{research}} on divorce, the subject of divorce dismissals has been neglected.

For example, in Kansas, divorce suits make up one-half of all civil <b>suits</b> <b>filed</b> in the district courts, the courts of general first instance. A somewhat similar situation exists in the other states.
