40|$|A {{new model}} for the linear {{viscoelastic}} behavior of polymer networks is developed. In this model the polymer system {{is described as a}} network of spring segments connected via <b>sticky</b> <b>points</b> (as in the Lodge model). [Lodge, A. S., “A network theory of flow birefringence and stress in concentrated polymer solutions,” Trans.

All segments that are located in between connected stickers are supposed to carry stress. The attachment and detachment of stickers is described with kinetic equations in which activation energies play a role. Simultaneous transitions involving groups of stickers are allowed. The model shows a strong dependence upon the number of segments per chain. Broad relaxation spectra can be obtained. The storage modulus can have more than one plateau corresponding with the fact that stress relaxation may need the breakup of several bonds...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the raison d’être of corporations {{as it is}} reflected in the maximands of corporate governance. The debate over stockholders’ versus stakeholders’ interests as such maximands has been raging for decades. Advances in economic theory have not only failed to resolve this debate but have established that the problem is graver than what many may have estimated. This paper turns this debate on its head: Instead of asking What or Whose interests should corporations maximize, the real question is Why is this debate taking place at all? Aiming to extend current economic analyses of the maximands issue, this paper puts forward a new theory about the factors that determine these maximands. Recent advances in psychological research point to value emphases at the individual and societal levels and to the need for cognitive closure as such factors. The theory proposes the notion of value complexity as an organizing element that may associate certain value emphases with cognitive style. Overall, this theory provides explanations for various <b>sticky</b> <b>points</b> in the stockholder-stakeholder debate in the United States and in international settings, identifies gaps in other theoretical accounts, and generates testable hypotheses for empirical research. Extant evidence supports this theory...|$|R

Five different combinations of pomegranate juice and maltodextrin (95 : 5, 90 : 10, 85 : 15, 80 : 20 and 75 : 25 v/w) were prepared and spray dried in a laboratory-type spray dryer. Increase in concentration of maltodextrin significantly increased the powder recovery and 20 % of maltodextrin was required for successful spray drying of pomegranate juice (powder recovery >  50 %). Color values of pomegranate juice powder were significantly influenced by concentration of maltodextrin. With increase in concentration of maltodextrin powder, lightness (L* value) increased from 45. 54 to 74. 46, a* value decreased from 20. 43 to 11. 45 and b* value decreased from 2. 16 to − 3. 83.

40|$|Two flexible, oppositely charged {{polymers}} {{can form}} liquid-like complex coacervate phases with rich but poorly understood viscoelastic properties. They {{serve as an}} experimental model system for many biological and man-made materials made from oppositely charged macromolecules. We use rheology to systematically study the viscoelastic properties {{as a function of}} salt concentration, chain length, chain length matching, and mixing stoichiometry of model complex coacervates of poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate), PDMAEMA, and poly(acrylic acid), PAA. The dynamics of making and breaking ionic bonds between the oppositely charged chains underlie all linear viscoelastic properties of the complex coacervates. We treat (clusters of) ionic bonds as <b>sticky</b> <b>points</b> and find that there is a remarkable resemblance between the relaxation spectra of these complex coacervates and the classical sticky Rouse model for single polymer systems. Salt affects all relaxation processes in the same way, giving rise to a widely applicable time–salt superposition principle. The viscoelastic properties of the complexes are very {{different from those of the}} individual components. In the complexes with a chain length mismatch, the effect of the mismatch on the viscoelastic properties is not trivial: changing the length of the polycation affects the relaxation behavior differently from changing the length of the polyanio...|$|R

Measurement and Comparison of Glass Transition and <b>Sticky</b> <b>Point</b> Temperatures of Distillers Dried Grains with Solubles (DDGS) with Varying Condensed Distillers Solubles (CDS) and Drying Temperature Levels. Cereal Chemistry 91 (4) : 406 - 413. Distillers dried grains with {{solubles}} (DDGS) is {{the main}} coproduct of the U. S. fuel ethanol industry and has significantly impacted the livestock feed markets in recent years. Particle agglomeration and subsequent flowability problems during storage and transport are often a hindrance, a nuisance, and expensive. This paper aims at characterizing the glass transition (Tg) and <b>sticky</b> <b>point</b> (Ts) temperatures of DDGS samples prepared with varying condensed distillers solubles (CDS) levels (10, 15, and 20 %, wb), drying temperatures (100, 200, and 300 °C), and moisture contents (0, 10, and 20 %, db), and it discusses implications on DDGS flowability behavior. Distillers wet grains were combined with specified levels of CDS and dried in a convection-style laboratory oven to produce DDGS. Subsequently, predetermined amounts of water {{were added to the}} DDGS to achieve desired moisture content levels. To determine Tg (°C), a differential scanning calorimeter was used, whereas Ts (°C) was determined through a novel technique with a rheometer. Results indicated high correlations between observed Ts and observed Tg (R 2 = 0. 87) data for DDGS samples. Also, the empirical model for predicted Tg = f (drying temperature, CDS level, and moisture content) based on the Gordon–Taylor model showed favorable R 2 (0. 74). Stickiness of DDGS increased with an increase in moisture content, indicating flow problems resulting from moisture. It was found that drying temperatures and CDS levels each had significant effects on Tg and Ts as well...|$|E
40|$|The {{difficulties}} in the storage of fruit juice {{and the use of}} juice powder in various food processing industries has made the juice powder attractive to consumers and producers. Making powder from fruit juice {{is one of the most}} complex methods of fruit processing. The hygroscopic nature of fruit juice component and its thermoplastic properties has caused the drying time control and the transportation of the product from the drying zone to the next stage to become very difficult. In this investigation with laboratory spray dryer, the effective parameters on orange juice powder deposit on the wall of the spray dryer was studied. The results indicate that the powder can not be made without the use of additives. Using liquid glucose as an additive to orange juice concentration increased the dryer performance and reduced the wall deposit considerably. With the help of liquid glucose additive, spray dryer optimum conditions were obtained with a feed flow rate of 15 ml/min, inlet air temperature of 130 oC and outlet air temperature of 85 oC. The results from the statistical analysis of the experimental data show that the parameters of inlet air temperature and feed flow rate have significant effects on the dryer yield and wall deposit both individually and jointly. By increasing inlet air temperature and feed flow rate, the dryer yield decreased but wall deposit increased. In spite of using suitable additives, the wall deposit was still in the range of 14 to 65 %. The results of experiments indicate that the main cause of wall deposit can be attributed to the wall high temperature. It is, therefore, necessary to keep the wall temperature below the orange powder <b>sticky</b> <b>point</b> temperature to prevent rising temperature in wall deposit. For the orange powder containing 2 % moisture, the <b>sticky</b> <b>point</b> temperature is 44 oC. To control the wall temperature, a dryer with double partition wall chamber and a cooling system is proposed...|$|E

40|$|Pointing at {{displays}} from {{a distance}} is becoming a common scenario for controlling computers and entertainment systems. Several devices use direct-pointing methods, where the user points a hand-held device at targets on a screen, but these often suffer from accuracy problems. Many techniques have been explored for improving mousebased pointing, but {{little is known about}} targeting assistance for distant pointing. We carried out experiments to test targeting assistance with a relative form of ray casting, common with devices such as the Nintendo Wiimote. We tested two motor-space techniques (sticky targets and target gravity), and three types of sensory-based acquisition feedback (visual, tactile, and aural). We found that the motor-space techniques were significantly more effective than control and that the sensory-based acquisition feedback. Overall, our studies provide initial results on the applicability of several previously uninvestigated targeting assists for distant pointing. Further, it shows the strong potential of motor space assists for improving target selection performance.

In this paper, pure and Pd-doped SnO 2 nanoparticles were synthesized by hydrothermal method and characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, respectively. The gas sensors were fabricated by side-heated preparation, and their gas sensing properties against CH 4, C 2 H 6, C 2 H 4, and C 2 H 2 were measured. Pd doping increases the electric conductance of the prepared SnO 2 sensors and improves their gas sensing performances to hydrocarbon gases. In addition based on the frontier molecular orbital theory, the highest occupied molecular orbital energy and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy were calculated. Calculation results demonstrate that C 2 H 4 has the highest occupied molecular orbital energy among CH 4, C 2 H 6, C 2 H 4, and C 2 H 2, which promotes charge transfer in gas sensing process, and SnO 2 surfaces capture a relatively larger amount of electric charge from adsorbed C 2 H 4...|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} of moisture within fructose and lactose droplets, subjected to convective drying conditions, was predicted using a convective-diffusion equation {{based on a}} solute fixed coordinate system. The partial differential equation was solved using the method of lines. Neumann and Robbins type boundary conditions were imposed at the centre and at the droplet-air interface, respectively. The temperature history was predicted by coupling the heat balance equation with {{the rate of change}} in average moisture. The {{distribution of}} glass transition temperature (T-g) within the droplet and at the surface layer was predicted. The concept of <b>sticky</b> <b>point</b> temperature (T-sticky) was introduced and used as an indicator of the development of stickiness at the droplet surface. Single droplets were dried in a controlled air stream and their moisture and temperature history were measured experimentally. These data were used to compare with the model predictions. A custom built in situ surface stickiness testing instrument was used to experimentally determine the development of surface stickiness at the droplet surface. These data were used to validate the model on surface stickiness. The model predicted the experimental moisture and temperature histories of fructose and lactose droplets within +/- 5 - 7 % absolute error and +/- 1 - 2 degrees C accuracy. It also predicted the development of surface stickiness of fructose and lactose droplets reasonably well. In test conditions, lactose surface attained non-sticky state through crystallization or transformation into glassy state. Fructose droplets remained sticky even in a bone dry state due to their low T-g. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Biological Systems Engineering, Washington State UniversityMango (Mangifera indica L.) {{is one of}} {{the finest}} {{tropical}} fruits in the world with about 75 % of the world production coming from Asia. In the Philippines, mango ranks third among fruit crops after banana and pineapple based on export volume and value. Acclaimed {{to be one of the}} best worldwide, this fruit has established a good reputation in the international market. However, huge postharvest losses ranging from 5 - 87 % have been reported due mainly to inadequate preservation technologies, and improper handling and storage. In this research, a more stable product such as mango powder was investigated using a novel drying technology called Refractance Window® drying (RW), and three other commonly used drying methods, namely: freeze drying (FD), drum drying (DD) and spray drying (SD). The influence of these four drying methods on the physical properties and microstructures of mango powder was studied. RW drying can produce mango powder with quality that is comparable to freeze drying, and better than the drum and spray-dried mango powders. Water sorption characteristics and glass transition temperatures of mango powder was examined to understand water mobility within the mango solids. Physical and chemical stability of mango powder were analyzed during storage at different temperatures and by subjecting them to different packaging atmospheres. Nitrogen flush packaging was effective in preserving the ascorbic acid (AA) in mango powder at room temperature and under refrigerated conditions, while reduced percentage loss of beta carotene was observed after 6 months of storage. Regardless of packaging atmosphere, mango powder stored at 45 °C suffered discoloration as well as AA and beta carotene degradation over a period of 6 and 12 months. Mango powder has high concentration of low molecular weight sugars which causes the product to become sticky when exposed to high temperatures and humid conditions. To avoid occurrence of this phenomenon, several sticky-point temperature measuring devices were explored in the past, but there is still a need for further development. A new method to characterize the sticky phenomena in mango powder was investigated using an advanced rheometer. The developed method and protocol was found suitable to characterize the <b>sticky</b> <b>point</b> temperature of mango powder with high degree of repeatability and accuracy.
