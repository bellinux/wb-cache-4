25|$|On May 29, 1814 Governor Macdonell sent John Spencer, the colony’s sheriff, {{to seize}} {{provisions}} {{located at the}} NWC's Rivière la <b>Souris</b> post. He confiscated 500 bags of pemmican, 96 kegs of grease and 9 bales of dried meat.(p.28) He also confiscated two chests of NWC-owned guns {{to prevent them from}} being sold to the Métis and thus preventing them from hunting buffalo. Part of the confiscated provisions were taken across the river to Brandon House, while the rest was taken to Fort Douglas under an armed escort. Next, Macdonell’s men confiscated 200 bags of pemmican from a HBC trader named Stett who was transporting 300 bags to York Factory. Shortly afterward, the NWC’s Duncan Cameron took an armed party of voyageurs to locate and arrest an HBC trader named House who had helped break into the Rivière la <b>Souris</b> post. Governor Macdonell next built a battery on the Assiniboine River to more effectively command the river and another on the Red River near Fort Douglas. The Red River blockade soon captured two NWC light canoes with 2 clerks, 20 men and 2 chests of arms. The voyageurs were paroled, but the clerks and the chests of arms were sent to Fort Douglas.|$|E
25|$|The electoral {{district}} {{was created in}} 1952 from the former districts of Brandon and <b>Souris.</b> It has been held by a centre-right party for all but one term of its existence. This tradition was broken in 1993 when massive vote-splitting between the Progressive Conservatives and Reform allowed the Liberals to sneak up the middle and take the riding. However, the seat reverted to form in 1997 when the PCs reclaimed it. The PCs and their successors, the modern Conservatives, have held the seat ever since. While Brandon has some Liberal and NDP support, {{it is not enough}} to overcome the conservative bent in the more rural areas of the riding.|$|E
25|$|As {{reported}} by the Inspector of Artillery, Maritime Provinces, in his ‘District Report, and by Lieutenant Colonel J.H. Gray, {{on the state of}} the militia in PEI, they acknowledged the fourth Island garrison battery, the Summerside Battery (authorized MGO G.O. 21 No.1 – 13 August 1875). These previously ‘independent’ four county batteries were ‘gathered together’ in March 1882, when the ‘Prince Edward Island Provisional Brigade of Garrison Artillery’ was authorized. Initially composed of an establishment of three Batteries, No.1 and No.2 in Charlottetown and No.3 in Georgetown, the PEI Brigade soon added No.4 Battery in <b>Souris</b> (24 Jan 1884), and No.5 Battery in Montague (17 October 1884).|$|E
25|$|The Mirage IV {{is powered}} by two SNECMA Atar turbojets, fed by two air intakes {{on either side of}} the {{fuselage}} that had intake half-cone shock diffusers, known as <b>souris</b> ("mice"), which were moved forward as speed increased to trim the inlet for the shock wave angle. It can reach high supersonic speeds: the aircraft is redlined at Mach 2.2 at altitude because of airframe temperature restrictions, although it is capable of higher speeds. While broadly similar to the model used on the Mirage III, the Atar engine had a greater airflow and an elevated overspeed limit from 8,400 rpm to 8700 rpm for greater thrust during high altitude supersonic flight. While the first Mirage IV prototype was fitted with double-eyelid engine nozzles, production aircraft featured a complicated variable geometry nozzle that automatically varied in response to the descent rate and airspeed.|$|E
25|$|Saskatchewan Provincial Highway 39 paralleled the {{headwaters}} of the <b>Souris</b> River as well as the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) along the south eastern portion of its route. The highway traverses a course on a diagonal from south east to north west. The road followed the early surveyed road allowances made by the Provincial Highway 39, the precursor of the Saskatchewan Highway 39 followed the surveyed grade of the CPR or Soo Line between the United States border and east of Moose Jaw. Travel along Provincial Highway 39 before the 1940s would have been traveling on the square following the township road allowances, barbed wire fencing and rail lines. As the surveyed township roads were the easiest to travel, the first highway was designed on 90 degree right angle corners as the distance traversed the prairie along range roads and township roads.|$|E
25|$|On January 10, 1817, Captain D’Orsonnes retook Fort Douglas without {{firing a}} shot and there {{captured}} Mclellan and 15 Nor'Westers. Though not quite abandoned as rumours suggested, dwindling provisions at the fort accounted for the small garrison. Soon after, D’Orsonnes’s men captured 2 sleighs of provisions from Bas de la Rivière en route to relieve the men at Fort Douglas. D’Orsonnes next sent a force to capture Bas de la Rivière {{in order to secure}} provisions for Selkirk and his men he expected would arrive in the spring or summer. It was also taken without firing a shot. On February 19, Cuthbert Grant arrived at Rivière la <b>Souris</b> with 26 Métis and attempted to raise a force to go to Fort Douglas and demand the release of NWC prisoners and possibly retake the fort. Grant ordered the NWC voyageurs to take up arms and join him but they refused. He threatened to send them back to Montreal to be punished for disobeying an officer but to no effect. On the 22nd, Grant departed for Fort Douglas with a small party of Métis and freemen. Grant {{sent a letter to the}} recently returned ex-governor Miles Macdonell demanding the release of NWC prisoners but was refused. On March 3, Grant devised a plan to set up an ambush at Frog Plain to capture the boats of the Red River settlers that were expected to arrive from Jack River House, however the plan was abandoned. A second plan was to attack Selkirk’s men at Pembina, as the Métis did not wish to return home without a victory, but a dispute between Grant and one of his officers caused the venture to be abandoned while en route.|$|E
25|$|On March 14, 1814 John Warren (who was a {{clerk in}} the colony) and 15 or 16 armed colonists {{travelled}} to the Métis hunting camp at Turtle River to acquire provisions. That night several NWC sleighs arrived to do the same, and Warren’s men forced them back empty handed. Shortly afterward, Gov. Macdonell, hearing that a NWC boat loaded with pemmican was being sent down the Assiniboine from Qu’Appelle, sent John Warren with a party of fifty men with two field pieces to seize it. The men had instructions to fire their muskets at any boat that passed and drive them ashore, and any that might refuse should be sunk by cannon fire. The colonists openly refused to obey the latter order, however. The NWC’s John Wills at Rivière la <b>Souris,</b> hearing of the blockade and not seeing the boat he expected, dispatched a party of six men to investigate, avoiding the blockade by taking the high-road around the river. Wills’ men found the boat crew encamped on the river shore and ordered them to cache the provisions in a hidden place. Seeing this party of armed Nor'Westers, the HBC battery obtained reinforcements. When the boat did not appear as expected, the Baymen searched for it and found the three Canadians encamped with an empty boat. Warren questioned them about their provisions and threatened to arrest them, but he received no response. After a search {{of one or two}} days, the cache of 96 bags of pemmican was discovered and taken to Ft. Douglas.(p.31) The HBC next blockaded the high-road the Nor’Westers used to circumvent the river blockade, which, besides disrupting the Nor’Wester’s use of the road, also would prevent the local natives and Métis from passing. One native family was taken prisoner. Upon learning this, the local Métis offered aid to the Nor’Westers for an attack on the HBC blockade, but the offer was declined.|$|E
500|$|Along {{the coast}} of New Brunswick, the storm {{produced}} 49ft (15m) waves that destroyed several boats, including 22 over open waters between Point Escuminac and Richibucto. Two bodies washed ashore in the latter city, and eleven bodies were eventually discovered. About one-third of the salmon boats in Miramichi were destroyed. Across New Brunswick, the storm disrupted communications near the coast. Along the coasts of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, high waves destroyed cottages and forced some families to evacuate. The former hurricane produced strong winds in the region, peaking at 75mph (120km/h), and its passage was accompanied by moderate rainfall, peaking at 4.29in (109mm) in Nova Scotia. There, many lobster cages were destroyed, and boats were removed from their moorings. In Prince Edward Island, up to 50% of lobster traps were destroyed or missing, including 5,000destroyed traps near <b>Souris.</b> As with New Brunswick, several boats were destroyed or washed ashore, and damage in the province was estimated at $750,000 (1959CAD, $781,000 1959USD). A total of 35people were killed between Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, mostly fishermen. As a result, the Escuminac Disaster, as {{it came to be}} known, became the deadliest work-related disaster in New Brunswick.
