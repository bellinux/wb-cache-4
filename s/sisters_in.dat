5|$|As is his pattern, Hosseini drew on {{his early}} {{experiences}} in Afghanistan {{to create the}} foundation of the book. He states that his travels to Afghanistan later in life also influenced his writing, albeit involuntarily. For example, during a 2009 visit he met two young <b>sisters</b> <b>in</b> a remote village outside Kabul. The older one, who he estimated to be around six years old, acted as a mother figure to the younger girl.

The sentence was carried out on 3 March 1884 at Kirkdale Prison, with the sisters attended to by a Roman Catholic priest. The deaths were witnessed by a reported one thousand people.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, {{while he}} was in command of the Duchess of York, his wife {{suddenly}} died in Toxteth. This event is said to have changed Stuart's demeanour and plunged him into a depression.

In 1934 he took over his last and most important seagoing role as Commodore of the CPS fleet and was placed in command of the 42,000-ton liner RMS Empress of Britain on her transatlantic route.|$|E
5|$|In July 1914, {{about two}} weeks after the {{assassination}} of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, Pommern was with the High Seas Fleet during its annual summer cruise to Norway.

Pommern remained with the High Seas Fleet throughout {{the first two years of}} the naval war.

5|$|Many {{elements}} can {{be considered}} as tributes to the power of cinema. In the prison theater, the inmates watch the film Gilda (1946), but this scene was originally intended to feature The Lost Weekend (1945). The interchangeability of the films used in the prison theater suggests that it is the cinematic experience and not the subject which is key to the scene, allowing the men to escape the reality of their situation. Immediately following this scene, Andy is assaulted by the <b>Sisters</b> <b>in</b> the projector room and uses a film reel to help fight them off. Then in the end of the film, Andy passes through a movie poster to escape his cell and ultimately Shawshank.|$|E

The character was voiced by Harry Hamlin in God of War II, who was chosen due to his previous portrayal of the character in the 1981 film Clash of the Titans.|$|E
