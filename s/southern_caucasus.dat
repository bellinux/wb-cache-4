5|$|The Khazars {{resumed their}} raids on Muslim {{territory}} after the Abbasid succession, reaching deep into Transcaucasia.

5|$|Three {{years after}} the {{toppling}} of the Provisional Government by the Bolsheviks in October 1917, the Red Army invaded the <b>southern</b> <b>Caucasus</b> republics of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia. In May 1920, Bagramyan, upset with the country's social and political conditions, participated in a failed rebellion against the Dashnak-led government of Armenia. He was jailed and sent {{to work in the}} fields for several months but was allowed to rejoin the military with the outbreak of the Turkish–Armenian War. But in December 1920, Armenia was sovietized and the national army was subsequently disbanded. Bagramyan, however, chose to join the 11th Soviet Army and was appointed a cavalry regiment commander.|$|E

25|$|By BP, {{groups of}} hominins began leaving Africa and {{settling}} southern Europe and Asia. <b>Southern</b> <b>Caucasus</b> {{was occupied by}} BP, and northern China was reached by BP. By {{the end of the}} Lower Paleolithic, members of the hominin family were living in what is now China, western Indonesia, and, in Europe, around the Mediterranean and as far north as England, southern Germany, and Bulgaria. Their further northward expansion may have been limited by the lack of control of fire: studies of cave settlements in Europe indicate no regular use of fire prior to BP.|$|E
25|$|The Greek {{historian}} Arrian mentions (perhaps anachronistically) the Caucasian Albanians for {{the first}} time in the battle of Gaugamela, where the Albanians, Medes, Cadussi and Sacae were under the command of Atropates. Albania first appears in history as a vassal state in the empire of Tigranes the Great of Armenia (95-56 BC). The kingdom of Albania emerged in the eastern Caucasus in 2nd or 1st century BC and along with the Georgians and Armenians formed one of the three nations of the <b>Southern</b> <b>Caucasus.</b> Albania came under strong Armenian religious and cultural influence.|$|E
25|$|General Yudenich, the Russian {{commander}} from 1915 to 1916, {{drove the}} Turks out {{of most of}} the <b>southern</b> <b>Caucasus</b> with a string of victories. In 1917, Russian Grand Duke Nicholas assumed command of the Caucasus front. Nicholas planned a railway from Russian Georgia to the conquered territories, so that fresh supplies could be brought up for a new offensive in 1917. However, in March 1917 (February in the pre-revolutionary Russian calendar), the Czar abdicated {{in the course of the}} February Revolution and the Russian Caucasus Army began to fall apart.|$|E

25|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} has established {{the earliest known}} production of wine from fermented grapes during the late Neolithic site of Hajji Firuz Tepe in the northern Iran Zagros Mountains or early Chalcolithic site in {{the northern edge of}} the Middle East. The earliest chemically attested grape wine was discovered at Hajji Firuz in the northwestern Zagros Mountains dating back to 5400 BC. Both archaeological and genetic evidence suggest that the earliest production of wine may slightly predate this: with the earliest wine-making likely having taken place in the <b>Southern</b> <b>Caucasus</b> (which encompasses Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan), or the West Asian region between Eastern Turkey, and Northwestern Iran.|$|E
25|$|Stalin's native Caucasus posed a {{particular}} problem due to its highly multi-cultural mix. Stalin opposed the idea of separate Georgian, Armenian, and Azerbaijani autonomous republics, arguing that these would likely oppress the many minorities within their territory; instead he called {{for the formation of}} a Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic. The Georgian Communist Party opposed the idea, resulting in the Georgian Affair. In the summer of 1921, he returned to the <b>southern</b> <b>Caucasus,</b> there calling on Georgian Communists to avoid the chauvinistic Georgian nationalism which he believed marginalised the Abkhazian, Ossetian, and Adjarian minorities. On this trip, Stalin met with his son Yakov, and brought him back to Moscow with them; Nadya had given birth to another of Stalin's sons, Vasily, in March 1921.|$|E
25|$|In 1826 Persia {{attacked}} Karabakh, {{starting the}} Russo-Persian War, 1826-1828. Madatov hurried to Tiflis to take {{command of the}} forces which would push the Persians out of <b>Southern</b> <b>Caucasus.</b> The 2,000 men under Madatov's command routed the 10,000 men Persian army {{on the banks of}} the Shamkhor river and retook Ganja on September 5. Upon hearing the news, crown prince of Persia Abbas Mirza lifted the siege of Shusha and marched towards Ganja. Additional Russian reinforcements under Ivan Paskevich arrived just in time to join their forces with Madatov and to form an 8,000-strong corps under Paskevich's command. Near Ganja they fell upon the Persians and forced them to retreat across the Araks river back to Persia. On 28 September of the same year Madatov was made Lieutenant General.|$|E

25|$|During World War I, the Armenians {{living in}} the Ottoman Empire were {{systematically}} exterminated {{by the government in}} the Armenian Genocide. According to some estimates, from 1894 to 1923, about 1,500,000—2,000,000 Armenians were killed by the Ottoman Empire. After the decision to exterminate the Armenians was taken by the Ottoman Ministry of Interior and first implemented with the Directive 8682 on February 25, 1915, tens of thousands of Russian Armenians joined the Russian army as Armenian volunteer units with a Russian promise for autonomy. By 1917, Russia controlled many Armenian-populated areas of the Ottoman Empire. After the October Revolution, however, the Russian troops retreated and left the Armenians irregulars one on one with the Turks. The Armenian National Council proclaimed the Republic of Armenia on May 28, 1918, thus establishing an Armenian state in the Armenian-populated parts of the <b>Southern</b> <b>Caucasus.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Established in December 1917, Dunsterforce was an Allied {{military}} force named after its commander, General Lionel Dunsterville. The force had fewer than [...] New Zealand, British and Canadian officers and NCOs, {{drawn from the}} Western and Mesopotamian fronts. The force was intended to organise local units in northern Iran and <b>southern</b> <b>Caucasus,</b> to replace the Tsarist armies that had fought the Ottoman armies in Armenia.

2500|$|Within the [...] "spondiogenys group", {{the gradual}} clinal {{variation}} over the large geographic range and the extensive intergradation {{means that the}} geographical limits and acceptance of the various subspecies varies between authorities.

2500|$|After Nader Shah's {{death in}} 1747, Erekle II and Teimuraz II {{capitalized}} on {{the eruption of}} chaos in mainland Iran.

Around 1760, at about the time Erekle II proclaimed the kingdom, it had become evident as well that Karim Khan Zand had become the new dominant Iranian ruler, at least for the time being. In 1762-1763, during Karim Khan's campaigns in Azerbaijan, Erekle II tendered his de jure submission to him and received his investiture as vali ("governor", [...] "viceroy") of Gorjestan (Georgia), the traditional Safavid office, which by this time however had become an [...] "empty honorific". Karim Khan died in 1779 however, with Persia again being engulfed into chaos.|$|E
