5|$|Julian Glover was a {{well-established}} character actor {{who had previously}} appeared in Doctor Who as Richard the Lionheart in The Crusade (1965). Glover was reluctant to don the Jagaroth mask created for scenes where Scarlioni had <b>shed</b> <b>his</b> human disguise as he felt the mask would impede his performance. As a result, he is doubled by Richard Sheekey {{in many of these}} scenes. Tom Chadbon was cast as Duggan on account of his resemblance to the Franco-Belgian comics hero Tintin. Peter Halliday had previously appeared in several Doctor Who serials including The Invasion and Doctor Who and the Silurians.|$|E
5|$|After Bunker Hill, Lafayette went to Maine and Vermont, thus visiting {{all of the}} states. He {{met again}} with John Adams, {{then went back to}} New York and then to its rival city, Brooklyn, where he laid the {{cornerstone}} for its public library. Lafayette celebrated his 68th birthday on 6 September at a reception with President John Quincy Adams at the White House, and departed the next day. He took with him, besides the soil to be placed on his grave, other gifts. Congress, at Monroe's request, had voted him $200,000 in gratitude for his services to the country, and a large tract of public lands in Florida. The passage back to France was aboard a ship that was originally called the Susquehanna, but was renamed the USS Brandywine in honor of the battle where the Marquis de Lafayette <b>shed</b> <b>his</b> blood for the United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1884, Tchaikovsky {{began to}} <b>shed</b> <b>his</b> unsociability and restlessness. That March, Tsar Alexander III conferred upon him the Order of St. Vladimir (fourth class), which {{included}} a title of hereditary nobility and a personal audience with the Tsar. This {{was seen as a}} seal of official approval which advanced Tchaikovsky's social standing and might have been cemented in the composer's mind by the success of his Orchestral Suite No. 3 at its January 1885 premiere in Saint Petersburg. In 1885, Alexander III requested a new production of Eugene Onegin at the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in Saint Petersburg. By having the opera staged there and not at the Mariinsky Theatre, he served notice that Tchaikovsky's music was replacing Italian opera as the official imperial art. In addition, thanks to Ivan Vsevolozhsky, Director of the Imperial Theaters and a patron of the composer, Tchaikovsky was awarded a lifetime annual pension of 3,000 rubles from the Tsar. This made him the premier court composer, in practice if not in actual title.|$|E

25|$|Later in 2014, Efron {{was seen}} in the adult comedy Neighbors (2014), co-starring Seth Rogen. The film {{revolved}} around a young couple, played by Rogen and Rose Byrne, who struggle to raise their baby daughter while living next to the house of a wild fraternity led by its president, played by Efron.

25|$|Astaire's {{last major}} musical film was Finian's Rainbow (1968), {{directed}} by Francis Ford Coppola. Astaire <b>shed</b> <b>his</b> white tie and tails {{to play an}} Irish rogue who believes that if he buries a crock of gold {{in the shadows of}} Fort Knox the gold will multiply. Astaire's dance partner was Petula Clark, who played his character's skeptical daughter. He described himself as nervous about singing with her, while she said she was worried about dancing with him. The film was a modest success both at the box office and among critics.|$|E

25|$|By now, Cromwell had <b>shed</b> <b>his</b> {{restrictive}} Columbia contract, {{with its}} handsome $500 per week salary, and pursued acting {{work as a}} freelancer in other media as well. On July 15, 1937, Cromwell guest-starred on The Royal Gelatin Hour hosted by Rudy Vallee, in a dramatic skit opposite Fay Wray. Enjoying the experience, Cromwell had his agent secure for him an audition {{for the role of}} Kit Marshall, on the soap opera Those We Love, first on NBC Radio and then CBS Radio. As a regular on the Monday night program which ran from 1938 until 1942, Cromwell played opposite Nan Grey who played Kit's twin sister Kathy. Cromwell as Kit was later replaced by Bill Henry. Rounding out the cast were Robert Cummings and Gale Gordon.|$|E
25|$|Ratti, a scholar, {{intended}} {{to work for}} Poland and build bridges to the Soviet Union, hoping even to <b>shed</b> <b>his</b> blood for Russia. Pope Benedict XV needed him as a diplomat {{and not as a}} martyr and forbade any trip into the USSR even though he was the official papal delegate to Russia. However, he continued his contacts with Russia. This did not generate much sympathy for him within Poland at the time. He was asked to go. “While he tried honestly to show himself as a friend of Poland, Warsaw forced his departure after his neutrality in Silesian voting was questioned” by Germans and Poles. Nationalistic Germans objected to a Polish nuncio supervising elections, and Poles were upset because he curtailed agitating clergy. On 20 November, when German Cardinal Adolf Bertram announced a papal ban on all political activities of clergymen, calls for Ratti's expulsion climaxed in Warsaw. Two years later, Achille Ratti became Pope Pius XI, shaping Vatican policies towards Poland with Pietro Gasparri and Eugenio Pacelli for the following 36 years (1922–1958).|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} eleven seasons of their {{existence}} in the NBA, the Suns had no official mascot, but some years later this mascot was born by accident. A messenger for Eastern Onion, a singing telegram service, came to the Coliseum during a home game dressed as a gorilla. As he left, Coliseum security suggested he do a few dances underneath the basket during a timeout and the fans loved it. So did the messenger, who kept coming to games until he was officially invited {{to be part of}} the team. And this is how this mascot was accidentally born. The messenger, a quiet young man named Henry Rojas, was anything but quiet in his costume. An early attempt was made involving a sunflower costume, but it never caught on. Given a Suns warm-up jacket, Rojas <b>shed</b> <b>his</b> shyness, and turned into an entertainment beast, dancing, joking with fans and, in general, enjoying himself to the fullest. Nowadays, the Suns Gorilla is one of the most famous mascots in the NBA.|$|E

500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Jesse Schedeen {{considered the}} cadets other than Lasky and Silva to be [...] "ready-made cannon fodder," [...] having received minimal development. This detracted from {{the quality of}} the third episode, as a betrayal by cadet Tchakova had little impact due to her shallow development. However, Schedeen did appreciate Green's acting in the last episode, noting that [...] " [...] death scene was handled very well, particularly as it forced Tom Green to <b>shed</b> <b>his</b> calm exterior and react much more emotionally." [...] In his later review of the Blu-ray, Schedeen complimented the audio and video quality, as well as the inclusion of many vignettes, documentary featurettes and commentaries.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Carlton Cuse and supervising producer Javier Grillo-Marxuach, {{who wrote}} the episode, decided that its plot would be centered on cementing Boone and Locke's relationship, by making the former go through a test of character. The episode's plot evolved gradually, with the vision quest {{being one of the}} first ideas to include. This led to the depiction of the Shannon-Boone relationship– which had not yet been explored– and making it the [...] "axis" [...] on which to tie Locke and Boone together. Cuse said that the series had hit a point narratively where Boone had become Locke's [...] "acolyte," [...] and he needed to [...] "sort of <b>shed</b> <b>his</b> obsession with Shannon in order to move forward in terms of his relationship with Locke." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{they had}} {{previously}} corresponded, Tchaikovsky made the personal acquaintance of another Rimsky-Korsakov pupil, Lyadov, during his November 1887 visit. Lyadov had the dubious distinction of being expelled from the Saint Petersburg Conservatory for cutting classes—a move {{on the part of}} the Conservatory that Rimsky-Korsakov had upheld. Lyadov was eventually readmitted, and became friends with Rimsky-Korsakov. He also assisted Rimsky-Korsakov and Balakirev in editing the orchestral scores of Borodin, and Rimsky-Korsakov and Alexander Borodin on scoring the [...] "Polovtsian Dances" [...] from Borodin's opera Prince Igor in 1878. Like Rimsky-Korsakov and Glazunov, Lyadov would become a professor at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory and a leading member of the Belyayev circle. Lyadov never totally <b>shed</b> <b>his</b> penchant for indolence and procrastination, and this would cost him the commission for the ballet The Firebird from impresario Sergei Diaghilev; the commission would go to the young Igor Stravinsky.|$|E

This {{was followed by the}} formal establishment of a navy and air force in early 1946. In the meantime, the Indonesian government had moved from Jakarta– now under Dutch control– to Yogyakarta in January; delegates led by Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir spent much of April and May unsuccessfully negotiating for Dutch recognition of Indonesian sovereignty.

500|$|In 858 Ímar, {{allied with}} Cerball, King of Ossory, routed {{a force of}} Norse-Irish at Araid Tíre (east of Lough Derg and the Shannon in modern-day County Tipperary). Ossory was a small kingdom wedged between the larger realms of Munster and Leinster. At the {{beginning}} of his reign in the 840s, Cerball's allegiance was pledged to the over-king of Munster, but as that kingdom grew weaker Ossory's strategic location allowed opportunities for his advancement. Cerball had previously fought against the Vikings, but he allied with them to challenge the supremacy of Máel Sechnaill and his Norse-Irish allies. The following year Amlaíb, Ímar and Cerball conducted a raid on Máel Sechnaill's heartlands in Meath, and in consequence a royal conference was held at Rathugh (modern-day County Westmeath).
