5|$|By early 1952, Robey was {{becoming}} noticeably frail, {{and he lost}} interest in many of his sporting pastimes. Instead, he <b>stayed</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and drew comic sketches featuring the Prime Minister of Mirth. In May he filmed The Pickwick Papers, in which he {{played the role of}} old Tony Weller, a part which he had initially turned down on health grounds. The following year, and in aid of the games fund, he starred as Clown in a short pantomime at the Olympic Variety Show at the Victoria Palace Theatre. Organisers asked for him to appear in the Prime Minister of Mirth costume instead of the usual clown garb, a request the comedian was happy to fulfil.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Caskey {{was born}} Clara Elizabeth Conningsby Gwyn on 20 May 1910 at Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. She {{was the third}} child of seven {{children}} (four girls and three boys) of Stratton Gwyn and Fanny Coningsby. She spent her early years in the prairies of Canada under difficult conditions. She attended elementary school at Dandas until 1921. From 1922 her high school education was at the Battleford Collegiate School at Battleford. She was a good debater in the school, and graduated from the school with distinction, getting the Governor General's Medal for Saskatchewan. From 1926 to 1927 she <b>stayed</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> learning piano as her mother thought she {{was too young to}} go to college.|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} the gender roles {{and attitudes toward}} women‟s and men‟s social roles of <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> fathers and employed fathers recruited on the Internet. The relationship between gender roles and attitudes toward women‟s and men‟s social roles on reasons for becoming a <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> father were also investigated. It was predicted that <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> fathers would endorse more traditionally feminine characteristics for themselves and would have more nontraditional attitudes toward men‟s and women‟s social roles than employed fathers. In addition, {{it was predicted that}} fathers who choose to <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> for practical reasons (i. e. lost job) would be more traditional in their gender role attitudes than fathers who choose to <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> for other reasons (i. e. really wanted to care for the children). Although <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and employed fathers reported having similar feminine and masculine characteristics, <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> fathers reported having less traditional gender role attitudes than employed fathers. Biosocial theory (Eagly & Wood, 1999) suggests that <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> fathers may have less traditional attitudes about gender roles because the gender role they are acting out is a non-traditional role for men. <b>Stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> fathers reported that they really wanted to stay home with their children more than any other reason, whereas the least reported reason for choosing to stay home was having a child with special needs. Contrary to a prediction based on evolutionary psychology, <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and employed fathers also reported that their children resembled them to the same degree. The results of this study will contribute further information about a group of fathers that have been under-studied and may also provide helpful information to support groups for <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and employed fathers.

5|$|Garfield led {{the first}} front porch {{campaign}} for the Presidency. He did not travel that much, and he usually <b>stayed</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> to present his presidential agenda to visitors. Garfield enlisted {{the support of the}} other candidates from the convention to help with the campaign. The 1880 Democratic National Convention chose Winfield Scott Hancock as the presidential candidate and William Hayden English as his vice-presidential running mate. The election featured a very close popular vote that put Garfield ahead with a majority of less than 10,000; some sources put the margin as low as 2,000. However, Garfield won the election with 214 of the 369 electoral votes in the country.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Bagramyan {{was born}} to Armenian parents {{in the village of}} Chardakhlu, near Yelizavetpol (modern Ganja, Azerbaijan), then a part of the Russian Empire. Chardakhlu was one of the largest Armenian {{settlements}} in the South Caucasus populated almost entirely by migrants from the village of Maghavuz in Nagorno Karabakh who continued keeping a connection with their ancestral land. Hamazasp Babadzhanian, a fellow Armenian who was to become the chief marshal of the Soviet Armor corps, was born in the same village. While Bagramyan's father, Khachatur, went to work all day at the railway station in Yelizavetpol, his mother, Mariam, <b>stayed</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> {{to take care of her}} seven children. Because his parents could not afford to send him to the local gymnasium, they decided to enroll him at a recently opened two-year school in Yelizavetpol.|$|E

Juan Torres worked several jobs to support his family, {{including}} car inspecting and assembly for General Motors, newspaper delivery for the Toronto Sun, construction and general contracting. Anna Torres <b>stayed</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> until after Torres and his siblings grew up, at which point she became a personal trainer. The two met in Toronto. At one point, Torres' father became unemployed and the family applied to the Toronto Maple Leafs Foundation to financially support Torres' hockey career.

5|$|McKinley was a noted protectionist, and was {{confident}} of winning an election fought on that question. But it was free silver {{that became the}} issue of the day, with Bryan capturing the Democratic nomination as a foe of the gold standard. Hanna raised millions for a campaign of education with trainloads of pamphlets to convince the voters that free silver would be harmful, and once that had its effect, even more were printed on protectionism. McKinley <b>stayed</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in Canton, running a front porch campaign and reaching millions through newspaper coverage of the speeches he gave to organized groups of people. This contrasted with Bryan, who toured the nation by rail in his campaign. Supported by the well-to-do, urban dwellers, and prosperous farmers, McKinley won a majority of the popular vote and an easy victory in the Electoral College. McKinley's systemized approach to gaining the presidency laid the groundwork for modern campaigns, and he forged an electoral coalition that would keep the Republicans in power most of the time until 1932.|$|E
5|$|The {{candidates}} were the same, but {{the issues of}} the campaign had shifted: free silver was still a question that animated many voters, but the Republicans focused on victory in war and prosperity at home as issues they believed favored their party. Democrats knew the war had been popular, even if the imperialism issue was less sure, so they focused on the issue of trusts and corporate power, painting McKinley as the servant of capital and big business. As in 1896, Bryan embarked on a speaking tour around the country while McKinley <b>stayed</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> this time making only one speech, to accept his nomination. Roosevelt emerged as the campaign's primary speaker and Hanna helped the cause working to settle a coal miners strike in Pennsylvania. Bryan's campaigning failed to excite the voters as it had in 1896, and McKinley never doubted that he would be re-elected. On November 6, 1900, he was proven correct, winning the largest victory for any Republican since 1872. Bryan carried only four states outside the solid South, and McKinley even won Bryan's home state of Nebraska.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{advances}} in relative social freedoms and legal rights, women were still {{expected to attend}} to the duties of the home. Along with child-rearing, women were responsible for spinning yarn, weaving cloth, sewing clothing, and cooking meals. Women who belonged to families that sold silk were especially busy, since their duties included coddling the silkworms, feeding them chopped mulberry tree leaves, and keeping them warm to ensure that they would eventually spin their cocoons. In the family pecking order, the dominant female of the household was the mother-in-law, who was free to hand out orders and privileges to the wives of her sons. Mothers often had strong ties with their grown and married sons, since these men often <b>stayed</b> <b>at</b> <b>home.</b> If a mother-in-law could not find sufficient domestic help from the daughters-in-law, there was a market for women to be bought as maids or servants. There were also many professional courtesans (and concubines brought into the house) who kept men busy in the pursuits of entertainment, relations, and romantic affairs. It was also common for wives to be jealous and conniving towards concubines that their wealthy husbands brought home. Yet two could play at this game. Most concubines were found in the families of feudal lords and kings. The ideal of the chaste, modest, and pious young woman was somewhat distorted in urban settings such as Hangzhou and Suzhou, where there were greedy and flirtatious women, as one author put it. This author stated that the husbands of these women could not satisfy them, and so took on as many as five 'complementary husbands'; if they lived close to a monastery, even Buddhist monks could suffice for additional lovers.|$|E

5000|$|The {{traditional}} role of [...] "father" [...] {{in the household}} is evolving; fathers are now expected to embrace more hands-on duties with their children. The roles are shifting so much {{that there has been}} an increase in [...] "stay <b>at</b> <b>home</b> fathers", compared to previous generations. Also, increases of positively portrayed <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> fathers in the media have been indicated. <b>Stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> fathers have made appearances in television shows and documentaries. An increase in media presence can contribute to the understanding and support for men who choose to care for their children. This evolution of [...] "fatherhood" [...] shows the dynamic nature of parental roles. A few overarching themes in fatherhood were found in a study interviewing 32 men across the United States. These themes consist of fathers feeling emotional closeness with their children, positive reaction from others about being a <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> fathers, and importance and pride in family work. The typical reasons behind becoming a <b>stay</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> father: wives high salaries, job “issues”, and wives being relocated for their jobs.|$|R
