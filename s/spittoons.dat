5|$|Small on {{the huge}} bench sits a wasted man with untidy white hair, an {{emaciated}} face {{in which two}} burning eyes are set like jewels, parchment-like skin split by a crack for a mouth; the face of Andrew Jackson three years dead... Upon this man has devolved the historic role of trying the Social Revolution. He is doing it like a gentleman. In many ways a most unusual trial. When the judge enters the court-room after recess, no one rises—he himself has abolished the pompous formality. He sits without robes, in an ordinary business suit, and often leaves the bench {{to come down and}} perch on the step of the jury box. By his personal orders, <b>spittoons</b> are placed by the prisoners' seats... and as for the prisoners themselves, they are permitted to take off their coats, move around, read newspapers. It takes some human understanding for a Judge to fly in the face of judicial ritual as much as that.|$|E

25|$|The hotel's Main Lobby was {{dramatic}} and opulent with {{green and gold}} decorations, carrying the theme through its carpets and drapes. It was furbished with marble throughout: floors, statues and a desk. Accents included brass fixtures and <b>spittoons.</b> There were over-sized, upholstered chairs, as well as shorter ones for women and children.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spittoon</b> - Traditionally a <b>spittoon</b> is {{used for}} the taster to expel the sipped cup that is being tasted. The <b>spittoon</b> is {{typically}} large and held between the legs of the taster to facilitate spitting.|$|R

50|$|Stool - Traditionally {{there is}} a short stool upon which the coffee taster sits with the <b>spittoon</b> between his/her legs. The stool is {{intended}} to raise the taster to the correct level {{with respect to the}} <b>spittoon</b> and the coffee tasting table to facilitate tasting.|$|R
25|$|Jackson also {{purchased}} three cut-glass chandeliers {{to light}} the room. Each chandelier, which featured 18 whale oil lamps, {{hung from the ceiling}} medallions and were complimented with whale oil wall sconces and table lamps. There were also 20 <b>spittoons.</b> His expenditures totaled $9,358.27, provided by a friendly Congress eager to make the White House a more elegant symbol of the nation.|$|E
25|$|Spitting is {{the act of}} {{forcibly}} ejecting saliva {{or other}} substances from the mouth. It is often considered rude and a social taboo {{in many parts of}} the world, including Western countries, where it is frequently forbidden by local laws (as it was thought to facilitate the spread of disease). These laws are generally not strictly enforced. In Singapore, the fine for spitting may be as high as SGD$2,000 for multiple offenses, and one can even be arrested. In some other parts of the world, expectoration is more socially acceptable (even if officially disapproved of or illegal), and <b>spittoons</b> are still a common appearance in some cultures. Some animals, including humans in some cases, use spitting as an automatic defensive move. Camels are well known for doing this, though most domestic camels are trained not to.|$|E
25|$|The rear {{portion of}} the omah consist of three {{enclosed}} rooms called senthong. The western senthong is used as storing rice and other agricultural produce, while the eastern senthong is used to store farming equipment. The central senthong is typically very small, build with a raised floor, lavishly decorated, and often curtained off from the house proper; resembling an enclosed bed than a room. Traditionally the central senthong was the abode of Sri herself. It is the room where incense is burnt for ceremonies, and in some areas the first rice grains of the harvest are placed here. In wealthy village houses in Central Java, the central senthong is flanked {{by a pair of}} mirrors and a pair of cabinets for holding important textiles. On {{the floor in front of}} the senthong is the loro blonyo, a statue of male and female in bridal attire, representing Sri and her male companion Raden Sadono. Also decorating the front of the central senthong are paired <b>spittoons,</b> textiles, and Madura wooden geese. The central senthong is also used as a sleeping room for newly married couples.|$|E

2500|$|The new Old Ebbitt Grill {{improved}} its menu. It reopened at {{the same}} location on October 13, 1970. The mahogany bar was slightly lowered, new HVAC installed, and a general $130,000 refurbishment completed. Clyde's and Old Ebbitt Grill shared the same menus, which lowered costs and led to improved training for kitchen staff. In June 1974, a Washington Post food review declared Old Ebbitt's fare to be [...] "American, plain, and not bad". By 1977, Washington Post food critic Donald Dresden was praising the restaurants bacon cheeseburgers and innovative menu items: [...] "Imitators {{are still trying to}} top Clyde's and the Ebbitt's bacon cheeseburgers and the disc-shaped deep-fried potatoes that come with—but they'll have to keep trying still." [...] The new owners retained Old Ebbitt's dark paneling, shelves of beer steins, mounted game trophies, and <b>spittoons,</b> which it had long showcased. The decor was made more whimsical, however, leading Washington Post architectural critic Wolf Von Eckardt to declare in 1978 that the Grill was [...] "one of the most charming rendezvous on the Eastern Seaboard". The restaurant featured bare, unpolished wood flooring throughout, with a fern bar on the second floor. Washington Post reporter Pamela Kessler said in 1981, [...] "The restaurant feels like old Philadelphia, rather than a slicker, parvenu Washington".|$|E
60|$|In a vast marble-paved hall, {{under the}} glare of an {{electric}} light, sat forty or fifty men, and for their use and amusement were provided <b>spittoons</b> of infinite capacity and generous gape. Most of the men wore frock-coats and top-hats--the things that we in India put on at a wedding-breakfast, if we possess them--but they all spat. They spat on principle. The <b>spittoons</b> were on the staircases, in each bedroom--yea, and in chambers even more sacred than these. They chased one into retirement, but they blossomed in chiefest splendor round the bar, {{and they were all}} used, every reeking one of them.|$|E
60|$|They {{went down}} to the rotunda floor together. The {{electric}} lights flooded the brilliant marbles with a dazzling light. Groups of men were gathered around <b>spittoons,</b> talking earnestly, gesticulating with fists and elaborate broad-hand, free-arm movements--political gestures, as Bradley recognized.|$|E
