50|$|When {{his father}} died, {{he took over}} his father's {{businesses}}. He refocused these businesses and increased their value, but eventually divested himself of these original businesses. In 1889 he and Wallace Field received three patents for a wooden pulley design, which was manufactured as the Lawson <b>Split</b> <b>Pulley.</b> These were sold all over the United States and in many countries around the world. Lawson also {{had an interest in}} a flour mill in Clintonville, but it went out of business, as many mills in Wisconsin did in that period, due to a shift based on an invention by John Stevens in nearby Neenah. Lawson himself wrote the foremost description of Stevens' invention, an account that was very praiseworthy {{despite the fact that it}} had a negative effect on a business he owned.|$|E
5000|$|Today the CVT works {{according}} to the same principle of <b>split</b> <b>pulleys</b> allowing infinitely variable gear ratios. Rather than the pulled rubber drive belts as originally used by DAF, the modern transmission is made much more durable {{by the use of}} steel link belts that are pushed by their pulleys. This update was pioneered by Fiat, Ford and Van Doorne in the Netherlands from the late 1970s. [...] The gearbox is also under electronic control.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} work explores computer-aided {{approach to the}} design of ten different couplings, viz a viz: flange, solid rigid, hollow rigid, old ham / cross-sliding, pin type flexible, sleeve, seller cone/ compression, <b>split</b> muff, <b>pulley</b> flange and fairbian’s lap-box couplings. The approach utilizes standard design equations of these couplings and link them together in computer software to determine the design parameters of the couplings. The work reviews the procedural steps involved in the design of couplings and the development of the software package using java as a tool for the design and dratfting of couplings. The design software named COUPLINGCAD combines with sketch template of a single process so as to generate the required parameters of the couplings. The COUPLINGCAD was tested with a number of case studies and the results obtained therein were quite satisfactory...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction: Congenital {{trigger thumb}} is an {{uncommon}} anamoly of children. Its management is controversial, ranging from observation to extensive surgical release. We report {{a case of}} delayed presentation of bilateral trigger thumb along with {{a brief review of}} past literature. Case Report: A six year old girl presented with fixed flexion deformity of interphalangeal joints of both thumbs and Notta’s nodules. It is diagnosed as trigger thumb and release of bilateral A 1 pulleys is done. But we found another constricting annular pulley just distal to A 1. Only after <b>splitting</b> the distal <b>pulley,</b> we could get complete extension of interphalangeal joints. At two years follow-up, the child is free of complications. Conclusion: Splitting of A 1 pulley alone may not be sufficient in few cases of trigger thumb. Keywords: Congenital trigger thumb, bilateral trigger thumb and variable pulley of thumb...|$|R
