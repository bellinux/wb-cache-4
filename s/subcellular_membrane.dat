The incorporation of radiolabeled methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine in diabetic sarcolemma was significantly depressed {{at all three}} catalytic sites (I, II, and III) of the methyltransferase system. An increase in methyl group incorporation was evident at site I without any changes at sites II and III in diabetic sarcoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Similar changes were also seen for the individual N-methylated lipids (monomethyl-, dimethylphosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylcholine) specifically formed at each catalytic site in all cardiac membranes from diabetic animals. These alterations in N-methylation were reversible by a 14 -d insulin therapy to the diabetic animals. In the presence of 10 microM ATP and 0. 1 microM Ca 2 +, N-methylation was maximally activated at site I in both control and diabetic sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum, but not in mitochondria. Incubation of cardiac membranes with of S-adenosyl-L-methionine showed that Ca 2 (+) -stimulated ATPase activities in both sarcolemma and sarcoplasmic reticulum were augmented; however, the activation of diabetic sarcolemma was lesser and that of diabetic sarcoplasmic reticulum was greater {{in comparison with the}} control preparations.

One of the most abundant of these lipids is phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4 -phosphate (PI 4 P), which is formed in human eukaryotes by type II and type III phosphatidylinositol 4 -kinase (PI 4 K II and III) activities. PI 4 K II activity occurs in many different <b>subcellular</b> <b>membranes,</b> although no {{detailed analysis of the}} distribution of this activity has been reported. Using density gradient ultracentrifugation, we have previously found that in A 431 cells the predominant PI 4 K activity arises from a type II alpha enzyme that is localized to a buoyant membrane fraction of unknown origin [Waugh, Lawson, Tan and Hsuan (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 17115 - 17121]. We show here that these buoyant membranes contain an activated form of PI 4 K II alpha that can be separated from the bulk of the PI 4 K II alpha protein in A 431 and COS- 7 cells. Proteomic analysis revealed that the buoyant membrane fraction contains numerous endoplasmic reticulum (ER) -marker proteins, although it was separated from the bulk of the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, transitional ER, Golgi and other major <b>subcellular</b> <b>membranes.</b> Furthermore, the majority of the cytoplasmic valosin-containing protein (VCP), an AAA+ATPase implicated in various ER, transitional ER, Golgi and nuclear functions, was almost completely localized to the same buoyant membrane fraction.

Herein, we provide evidence suggesting that this GAPDH isoform can reconstitute in vitro protein-catalyzed fusion between naturally occurring <b>subcellular</b> <b>membrane</b> fractions involved in insulin exocytosis. Utilizing purified rat pancreatic β-cell plasma membranes and secretory granules, we show that a brain cytosolic factor catalyzed the rapid and efficient fusion of these two purified membrane fractions which could be inhibited by a monoclonal antibody directed against the brain isoform of GAPDH. Moreover, the brain cytosolic factor also catalyzed the fusion of reconstituted vesicles prepared from lipid extracts of islet plasma membranes and secretory granules. Although the brain cytosolic factor rapidly catalyzed membrane fusion between islet plasma membranes and secretory granules, it did not catalyze fusion between one secretory granule population with another. To identify the potential importance of brain cytosolic factor catalyzed membrane fusion in islet cells, we examined extracts of hamster insulinoma tumor cells (HIT cells) for fusion-catalyzing activity. A protein constituent was present in HIT cell cytosol which was immunologically similar to the rabbit brain GAPDH isoform. Although native HIT cell cytosol did not catalyze membrane fusion, removal of an endogenous protein inhibitor unmasked {{the presence of the}} protein which catalyzed membrane fusion activity and such fusion was ablated by a monoclonal antibody directed against the brain isoform of GAPDH. Collectively, these results suggest the possibility that an isoform of brain GAPDH, also evident in HIT cells, can catalyze fusion between the two naturally occurring <b>subcellular</b> <b>membrane</b> compartments involved in insulin secretion and suggest a novel paradigm potentially coupling glycolytic flux with insulin release...|$|E
