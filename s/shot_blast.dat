40|$|The {{oxide scale}} created during {{manufacturing}} {{of stainless steel}} is often removed by a chemical pickling with mixed acid. Various pre-treatments to pickling are also applied {{to increase the efficiency}} of the oxide scale removal. <b>Shot</b> <b>blasting</b> is one such pre-treatment, which operates to remove a certain amount of oxide and also to generate cracks and openings for the subsequent pickling. In this work, three materials, AISI 2205, 430 and 304 have been blasted and later exposed to mixed acid. This was conducted to quantify the effect <b>shot</b> <b>blasting</b> has on the subsequent pickling of stainless steel. Three shot products and two blasting parameters were investigated and varied. <b>Shot</b> <b>blasting</b> significantly reduced the oxide scale but was unable to remove the chromium oxide layer closest to the steel surface. No significant difference was observed when comparing the result from the three <b>shot</b> products after <b>blasting.</b> Increasing the particle velocity or the coverage rate further enhanced the pickling but reduced the amount of oxide removed during blasting. These effects are however relative small, so in practise relatively mild conditions seems preferable for economic reasons.

In <b>shot</b> <b>blasting</b> processes the stream of shots is generated and shaped by blasting turbines, making up a kinetic and dynamic system comprising a separating rotor, an adapting sleeve and a propelling rotor provided with blades. The <b>shot</b> <b>blasting</b> performance- i. e. the quality of shot treated surfaces depends on the actual design and operational parameters of the unit whilst the values of relevant parameters {{are associated with the}} geometry of turbine components and the level of its integration with the separator system. The circulation of the blasting medium becomes the integrating factor of the process line, starting from the hopper, through the propeller turbine, casting treatment, separation of contaminated abrasive mixture, to its recycling and reuse.

40|$|Abstract. Fire {{safety is}} a major concern with steel {{structures}}. Actually, steel structures were not fatally destroyed in most cases of fire. These damaged steel structures may be reused after structural inspection, safety appraisal and necessary repair. Bolted connections are the most widely used connection in steel structures. Slip coefficient is a key parameter to calculate the slip bearing capacity of bolted slip-critical connections. Currently there are few research results available about slip coefficient of bolted slip-critical connections after fire. To obtain the effect of heating and cooling on slip coefficient, a series of slip load tests on connections that had been heated and cooled to ambient temperature were carried out in this study. Methods of friction surface treatment included <b>shot</b> <b>blast</b> and painting inorganic zincs after <b>shot</b> <b>blast.</b> Test results show that heating and cooling have a great effect on slip coefficient of connections with two methods of friction surface treatment, among which effect on connections with shot blasting surfaces is more significant...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} investigates and analyzes {{wear properties}} of 316 stainless steel {{before and after}} applying paste boronizing process and to investigate the effect of <b>shot</b> <b>blasting</b> process in enhancing boron dispersion into the steel. In order to enhance the boron dispersion into 316 stainless steel, surface deformation method by <b>shot</b> <b>blasting</b> process was deployed. Boronizing treatment was conducted using paste medium for 8 hours under two different temperatures which were 8500 C and 9500 C. Wear behaviour was evaluated using pin-on-disc test for abrasion properties. The analysis on microstructure, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and density were also carried out before and after applying boronizing treatment. Boronizing process that had been carried out on 316 stainless steel increases the wear resistance of the steel compared to the unboronized 316 stainless steel. The effect of boronizing treatment together with the <b>shot</b> <b>blasting</b> process give a greater impact in increasing the wear resistance of 316 stainless steel. This is mainly because <b>shot</b> <b>blasted</b> samples initiated surface deformation that helped more boron dispersion due to dislocation of atom on the deformed surface. Increasing the boronizing temperature also increases the wear resistance of 316 stainless steel. In industrial application, the usage of the components that have been fabricated using the improved 316 stainless steel can be maximized because repair and replacement of the components can be reduced {{as a result of}} improved wear resistance of the 316 stainless steel...|$|R

Roughness level {{and the nature of}} the abrasive particles of <b>shot</b> <b>blasting</b> influence energetically the samples; increasing the hydrophobic behaviour with the increase of the surface roughness and the alumina use. The contamination due to steam autoclaving hydrophobizes the surface; contrary to sterilization by ethylene oxide, which reduces the contact angle value.

40|$|The {{effect of}} heat {{treatment}} on the abrasive wear behavior of high chromium cast iron (NF 253 AHT) under dry sliding condition has been investigated. Rectangular cross sectioned {{samples of the}} alloy were produced by sand casting. After casting, the samples were machined to equal dimensions of 50 mm x 15 mm x 10 mm and heat treated by annealing, hardening and tempering. Abrasive wear tests were carried out on the samples using the pin-on-disc wear test. The tests were carried out under restricted values of speed, load and time. Within this limit, the hardened sample displayed a superior wear resistance, while the annealed sample displayed the weakest wear resistance. A graphical model (wear map) displaying all the wear regimes of the alloy, which {{may serve as a}} wear predictive tool was subsequently developed from the results of the wear tests. With the exception of the as-cast and annealed specimen, all other specimens (hardened and tempered) have functioned adequately in wear prone environment, but with different degree of effectiveness.

40|$|Abstract. Ingots of AZ 31 alloys were {{prepared}} for the present study. The ingots were hot rolled to 0. 5 mm thickness. In order to develop rolled magnesium alloy sheet having excellent plastic formability, the authors attempted the grain refinement and randomization of the rolling texture of the alloy by means of surface modification utilizing wet-type <b>shot</b> <b>blast</b> (wet blast) and subsequent annealing. Then the microstructural observations including texture analysis and tensile tests were carried out. Furthermore, the bendability and stretch formability were investigated. After wet blast and subsequent annealing at 573 K for 1 h, the region of 50 µm depth from the sheet surface that experienced deformation by wet blast is recrystallized, and fine and equiaxed grains are generated. Although rolling texture remained in {{the central part of}} the sheet, the recrystallized grains near the surface of such specimens have random crystallographic orientation. The tensile strengths of both rolled and wet-blasted specimens are almost the same but the elongation of the latter increases due to grain refinement and randomization of crystallographic orientation. Such a microstructural feature realizes bending with the radius of 1 mm without cracks and wrinkles and leads to an increase in limiting stretching depth by 1. 5 ~ 2 mm...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation of the}} mechanisms of pit elimination in strip drawing and rolling of stainless steel strips. Strip drawing tests with artificial in-dents confirm the role of micro-plasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (MPHL) in allowing pits to be reduced in size and depth. The similarity of results for two oils, which differ in viscosity {{by a factor of}} 10, is attributed to the fact that oil is drawn out of the pits rather easily, so that the behavior tends to the unlubricated case. Similar behavior is observed for strip drawing of <b>shot</b> <b>blast</b> white hot band. For much smoother bright anneal strip, it is suggested that the presence of an oil film in the unpitted region prevents generation of pressure differences between the pits and the unpitted regions. A comparison of strip-drawn and cold-rolled stainless steel samples show that the change in pit area and Rq roughness varies with overall reduction in a remarkably similar way. The reason for such similar behavior is attributed to the absence of hydrodynamic action in preventing pit elimination, albeit for opposite reasons. The similar rate of pit evolution in both cases confirms the usefulness of the strip drawing rig as a tool to model the change of surface topography during rolling, as long as care is taken in matching the regimes of lubrica-tion.

50|$|The {{accuracy}} of the casting {{is limited by the}} type of sand and the molding process. Sand castings made from coarse green sand impart a rough texture to the surface, and this makes them easy to identify. Castings made from fine green sand can shine as cast but are limited by the depth to width ratio of pockets in the pattern. Air-set molds can produce castings with smoother surfaces than coarse green sand but this method is primarily chosen when deep narrow pockets in the pattern are necessary, due to the expense of the plastic used in the process. Air-set castings can typically be easily identified by the burnt color on the surface. The castings are typically <b>shot</b> <b>blasted</b> to remove that burnt color. Surfaces can also be later ground and polished, for example when making a large bell. After molding, the casting is covered with a residue of oxides, silicates and other compounds. This residue can be removed by various means, such as grinding, or <b>shot</b> <b>blasting.</b>|$|R
