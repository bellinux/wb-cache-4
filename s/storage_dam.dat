5|$|After nearly 30 {{years of}} {{struggling}} with funding and pursuing various deals, William Beardsley hired engineer Carl Pleasant {{to assist with}} designing. Pleasant recommended hiring the engineer firm Peckham and James to draft plans for the <b>storage</b> <b>dam</b> at the Frogs Tank site. The gravity dam design was dropped, and a relatively new, cheaper and improved but controversial design was adopted: the multiple-arch buttress dam. In 1925, under a new state law, Beardsley was able to create the Beardsley-Agua Fria Water Conservation District. Under the new district, funds could be raised through a bond issue. On December 20, 1925, the construction contract was signed, but the bonds {{had yet to be}} purchased. Five days before the contract was signed, Beardsley died. His son, Robert took direction of the project along with Pleasant. In early 1926, Pleasant eventually sold the needed bonds to the New York firm Brandon, Gordon and Waddell. The firm sent Donald Ware Waddell to oversee construction.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{construction}} on the Central Arizona Project (CAP) began while many of its facilities were still being planned and approved. One {{integral part of the}} project was a <b>storage</b> <b>dam</b> on the Salt River, Orme Dam. However, in 1977, US President Jimmy Carter recommended that Orme Dam and two other projects on the Gila River System be removed from the CAP plan because of their negative impacts and cost. While the two other projects (Hooker and Charleston Dam) were easily removed, Orme was not. Orme's removal was hampered by controversy that {{led to the creation of}} the Central Arizona Water Control Study (CAWCS) in 1979 after Secretary of the Interior Cecil D. Andrus requested that the Bureau of Reclamation identify a replacement. In 1980, the CAWCS recommended the removal of any storage units on the Gila River. Recent flooding within the CAWCS area and the Orme Dam problem led to an expansion of the study to include dams for flood control.|$|E

25|$|Mining, which {{provided}} more than 60% of Peru's export earnings in 2006, {{is a major}} water user and polluter. It is estimated that mining uses about 5% of Peru's water. In addition, it severely affects water quality. It {{has been estimated that}} more than half of Peru's peasant communities have been affected by mining activities, leading to the creation of organizations such as the National Committee of Mine Affected Communities (CONACAMI). The government had to declare an environmental state of emergency at several mining sites due to environmental disasters. For example, in July 2008 it declared a state of emergency at a mine near Lima over fears that arsenic, lead and cadmium from its tailings dam could pollute the main water supply for the capital. In July 2010 the government declared another state of environmental emergency in the central mining district of Huancavelica after a wastewater <b>storage</b> <b>dam</b> of the Caudalosa Chica company collapsed and leaked water laden with heavy metals into local rivers. The city La Oroya on the Mantaro River in Central Peru where the company Doe Run operates a big mining complex has been ranked as one of the 10 most contaminated cities in the world in 2007. Furthermore, an estimated 100,000 small-scale informal miners pollute rivers with cyanide and mercury.|$|E
500|$|First {{referred}} to as the Frogs Tank Dam, the original Waddell Dam was the ambition of local businessmen who wanted to develop a project that used the Agua Fria for the irrigation of around [...] of land. This was to be accomplished with a <b>storage</b> <b>dam,</b> diversion dam and system of canals. Their advancement of the project began in 1888 with the formation of the Agua Fria Water and Land Company. The company hired George Beardsley's Agua Fria Construction Company, and in 1892, construction on the project began. In 1895, Beardsley died, and his brother William who was now president of the Water and Land Company helped continue the project. In 1896, {{due to a lack of}} funding caused by poor nationwide economic conditions, the project was halted. The Water and Land Company soon went bankrupt, but William Beardsley would keep the project alive. Work had been primarily done on the diversion dam and canal while only the foundation of the <b>storage</b> <b>dam,</b> a gravity dam, was completed. The diversion dam, Camp Dyer Diversion Dam, was named after Edgar J. Dyer, a surveyor on the project.|$|E

40|$|Since the 1990 th Sasol, a local Non-Governmental-Organization (NGO), builds sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams,</b> to {{mitigate}} the consequences of droughts in the semi-arid county of Kitui, Kenya. Sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams</b> are dams constructed in ephemeral rivers which increase the storage capacity of the riverbeds. The water stored by sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams</b> enables local people to generate income through irrigated agriculture and brick making. By exploiting the stored water people also influence the groundwater flows and tables through water extraction and evapotranspiration, runoff and infiltration through the cultivation of land. This two way feedback between society and water system is further influenced by local circumstances like water quality, slopes and local initiatives. In this study the long term effects of sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams</b> on hydrology and water use were assessed in the Kiindu catchment near Kitui town. It combines observed human agency and simulated effects of sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams</b> on groundwater levels to depicture what is called in socio-hydrology the coevolution of society and water system after the construction of sans <b>storage</b> <b>dams.</b> During a fieldtrip the study area, the local circumstances and the exploitation of water sources were assessed by means of trans-sectional walks and semi-structured interviews. The results show the interaction of local circumstances, society and water system led to different local developments even in a small catchment like the Kiindu catchment. How water is extracted and used depends on catchment properties. If the riverbanks are broad and lots {{of water from the}} riverbed can be extracted like in the downstream of the study area, people do irrigated agriculture on the riverbanks. But in such areas it is hard to find locations where sand dams can be founded on rock. Therefore sand dams are endangered by erosion of the riverbanks. In areas with steeper slopes and narrow and thin riverbeds, irrigated agriculture cannot be applied in the vicinity. Here people need to invest in equipment to utilize the water stored by the sand dams. But in these areas there are more locations where sand dams can be founded on rocks. Therefore the sand dams are more robust. Other factors that influence the utilization of water from the catchment are water quality and the availability of alternative water sources. To investigate how the effects of the sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams</b> on the groundwater tables may influence the availability of water and therefore the water use, a groundwater model was developed. With the ‘pmwin’ groundwater model, which is based on the finite-difference groundwater model MODFLOW, the influence of local catchment properties on the performance of the sand dams were assessed and changes in flow directions around sand dams analysed. The simulations show that the slopes of the stream and the thickness of the riverbed {{have a major impact on}} the amount of water stored by the sand dams. Because the sand dams which store the largest amount of water lie in the area where most of the irrigated fields are located, the modelling results give a possible explanation for the observed development. The study shows that the sand dams in general lead to larger amounts of water available in the catchment. Therefore they improve living conditions of the local communities. However the effects of the sand dams differ between the areas. In some areas they only help the communities to satisfy their domestic water demand, while in other areas people have sufficient water to generate income through irrigated agriculture. But sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams</b> may also fail and their effect abate afterwards. Thus the study shows that there is not ‘The Effect’ of the sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams</b> on the development of a catchment. To understand why sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams</b> have a certain effect it is important to take the local circumstances into account by assessing their effects. One should also be cautious and choose a flexible implementation and operation approach that takes the local circumstances into account if the experience with sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams</b> is transferred from one area to another. Finally, if there is not ‘The Effect’ of sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams,</b> how do developments of catchments look like after the construction of sand <b>storage</b> <b>dams?</b> Based on the information obtained in the field, hypothetical socio-hydrological narratives for small sub areas in catchment, which need to be proved in further research, are formulated to show how these sub-catchments may have developed.
