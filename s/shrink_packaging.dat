40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to show the {{effectiveness}} of die <b>shrink</b> as a <b>package</b> solution for memory devices. In the case of the 8 mm x 10 mm Direct Rambus DRAM device, about 350 dies can be obtained from a single 8 -inch wafer. The 85 % linear shrink (15 % shrink in both x and y-directions) allows an additional 150 dies from the same size wafer. This simple calculation explains the importance of die shrink. There are two basic requirements for the die <b>shrink</b> <b>package</b> solution. First, the footprint of the new package must be the same as that of the earlier package because a mounting board with multiple devices on it can not be changed to accommodate the footprint change of single device. Second, the test socket for the new package must be the same or compatible with minimal modification because the delivery time and expense for new sockets for test and burn-in are significant. In this paper, the CSP die shrink solution will be limited to a discussion of the µBGA ® package only. There are two different types of µBGA CSP: a package for peripheral pad die and a package for center pad die. Each type has its own package solutions for the die shrink problem. Flash, SRAM, and 64 / 72 M Direct RDRAM are devices with peripheral bonding pads. For this study, a 6 x 8 ball matrix was used.

40|$|In {{responding}} {{the demands}} to {{the trend in}} <b>shrinking</b> <b>package</b> dimensions and shorter assembly cycle time, thermosonic flip chip bonding is highly advocated in the last decade, where gold-to-gold bonds are formed under both thermal and ultrasonic energy. As a matter of fact, much of our knowledge of thermosonic flip chip bonding comes from wirebonding technology, where it is commonly agreed that {{the flexibility of the}} process windows in wirebonding decreases with the increase in ultrasonic frequency, even though the bond time and the bond temperature are usually lower under higher ultrasonic frequency. Our main objective is to compare the process windows under different ultrasonic frequencies for thermosonic flip chip application. The interaction effects of bond power and bond force on the die shear strength and package standoff height are elucidated. The effects due to different substrate materials (FR- 4 and ceramic substrates) are also included. It is interesting to notice that apparently the vibrating amplitude and thence the bonding frequency {{play a key role in}} determining the robustness of the thermosonic flip chip bondings. Based on our findings the process windows of 63 kHz and 109 kHz bonding on FR- 4 and ceramic substrates are established respectively and compared. Unlike some earlier studies on high frequency bonding in wirebonding, the findings in this work suggests that the process window of the 109 kHz bonding is in fact wider than the 63 kHz bonding on both substrate materials, where rigid ceramic substrates allowed larger process windows for both frequencies bondings than FR- 4 substrates...|$|R

40|$|The {{predictive}} {{value of a}} statistical model can often be improved by applying shrinkage methods. This can be achieved, e. g., by regularized regression or empirical Bayes approaches. Various types of shrinkage factors can also be estimated after a maximum likelihood fit has been obtained: while global shrinkage modifies all regression coefficients by the same factor, parameterwise shrinkage factors differ between regression coefficients. The latter ones have been proposed especially {{in the context of}} variable selection. With variables which are either highly correlated or associated with regard to contents, such as dummy variables coding a categorical variable, or several parameters describing a nonlinear effect, parameterwise shrinkage factors {{may not be the best}} choice. For such cases, we extend the present methodology by so-called 'joint shrinkage factors', a compromise between global and parameterwise shrinkage. Shrinkage factors are often estimated using leave-one-out resampling. We also discuss a computationally simple and much faster approximation to resampling-based shrinkage factor estimation, can be easily obtained in most standard software packages for regression analyses.

40|$|Optical {{networks}} are a critical element of contemporary communications infrastructure, {{due to their}} efficacy in transmitting high-speed data over large distances. Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) offer compelling advantages in terms of performance and miniaturization, but increasing the power density of these components, coupled with <b>shrinking</b> <b>packaging</b> footprint, presents a significant thermal management challenge. This has driven {{the need for the}} integration of liquid-based micro fluidic cooling artefacts into next generation PIC packages. Liquid microjets are emerging as a candidate primary or secondary heat exchanger for such packages, however, the thermal-hydraulic behaviour of confined, low Reynolds number liquid slot jets is not comprehensively understood. The objective of this thesis is to characterise the inf uence of slot jet geometry modi cations as a technique for the passive control and enhancement of single-phase convective heat transfer. The slot jets investigated featured five different nozzle aspect ratios (L/W), and five different passive outlet structures in the form of tabs and chevrons. The investigation was carried out for slot jets in the laminar ow regime, over a Reynolds number range of 100 ≤ ReDh ≤ 500 { and with a xed con nement height to hydraulic diameter ratio (H=Dh) of 1. Particle - Image Velocimetry (PIV) and an iso ux foil technique were utilised to identify the uidic mechanisms associated with each geometry and to understand their corresponding in uence on the spatial temperature distributions along the heated surface. The hydrodynamic penalty of any enhancements in heat transfer achieved were then determined through the measurement of the pressure drop across each nozzle geometry. It was found that increasing the jet nozzle aspect ratio from 1 to 8 resulted in enhancements in area-averaged Nusselt number (NuAvg) of up to 68 %, and a corre- sponding decrease in head loss coe cient (K) of 12 %. Within the stagnation zone, correlations extrapolated from the experimental results showed that the stagnation point Nusselt number (Nu 0) had a very weak dependency on the jet nozzle aspect ratio, but scaled with Re 0 : 55 Dh. This Reynolds number scaling was indicative of the potential core of the jet striking the impingement surface. O -center peaks observed in the velocity ow elds of the impinging jets were postulated to be {{as a result of the}} stagnation zone uid dynamics and local ow entrainment. When compared to the baseline case, all outlet tab geometries resulted in increased local and area-averaged heat transfer and, for the same pumping power, enhancements in NuAvg of up to 29 % were achieved through the application of the major triangle outlet tab geometry. It was also determined that the geometry and location of the outlet tabs were found to in uence the local heat transfer coe cients within both the stagnation and wall jet zones. It was concluded that the passive control and enhancement of an integrated microjet cooling solution could be achieved through geometry modification { without compromising the stringent design constraints of an integrated microf uidic package, such as confinement height, flow rate, and the required pumping power...|$|R

40|$|Polyethylene is a {{thermoplastic}} polymer {{composed of}} a repeating unit (-CH 2 -CH 2) n. It is the most consumed plastic due to its low price and ease of manufacture. It can be described by three basic characteristics that influence the processing and properties: density, molecular weight and molecular weight distribution. Principally, polyethylene is classified according to its density. The more used in the film industry are: low density polyethylene (LDPE), lineal low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Polyethylene films are produced by blow extrusion, usually from the pellets of LDPE. And one important application of these films is <b>packaging.</b> <b>Shrink</b> films are very used in the packaging industry. The film shrinks because {{a high degree of}} molecular orientation or internal stress was introduced into it during its manufacture. When the film is introduced in an oven and reheated to a temperature above its softening point the internal stresses are released, causing the film to shrink. However, these films need more studies to prevent the problems that appear during the shrink process. And this is the objective of this project: to improve the shrink process studying the heat transfer in the oven, knowing that there happen four phenomena: radiation and convection heat transfer between the oven and the film; conduction heat transfers between the film and the bottles and convection heat transfer between the bottles and the oven. The calculations have been made for four different formulations. One important fact in the shrinkage is the Blow up ratio (BUR). It is a number that refers to the ratio of a blown film bubble diameter to the extrusion die diameter. The higher the BUR, the larger the bubble diameter is in relation to the die. There are two ways to determinate the shrink-percentage. One method is by immersion of the film in an oil-bath at a chosen temperature. The other method consists in a sample introduced in a hot oven and subsequently cooled down to the room temperature. However, to calculate the shrinkage in the laboratory the samples have been heated in an oven to different temperatures (130 ºC, 135 ºC, 140 ºC, 190 ºC and 220 ºC) during different times, with the objective to see the percentage of shrinkage in the machine direction (MD) and the transverse direction (TD). As previously mentioned, the orientation of the film is an important aspect to the final shrinkage. For that reason, the orientation of the films in the study has been measured by an infrared spectroscopy method. The finally results of the shrinkage, the heat transfer and the orientation of the films have been related to arrive {{to the conclusion that the}} shrinkage of the film is a combined result of the film orientation, the temperature of the oven and the melting temperature of the films. And also that the important heat transfer happen just in the first 1, 9 seconds...|$|R
