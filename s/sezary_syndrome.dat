40|$|It was {{the purpose}} of this study to {{characterize}} the proliferating cells in skin lesion of <b>Sézary's</b> <b>syndrome</b> and of mycosis fungoides by means of their surface markers and their response to Phytohemagglutinine mitogen stimulation. Viable infiltrating cells were freed from skin biopsy specimens by means of a disaggregating homogenizer and the cells yielded were tested with heterologous polyvalent anti-human Ig and with antihuman T-cell globulin, as well as for spontaneous rosette formation with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and for their response to stimulation with Phytohemagglutinine. Most of the infiltrating cells in skin lesions of mycosis fungoides and <b>Sézary's</b> <b>syndrome</b> lack receptors for anti-human Ig but form spontaneous rosettes with SRBC and have receptors for anti-T-cell globulin, indicating the T-lymphocyte nature of the infiltrating cells; however, their response to Phytohemagglutinine is weak.

40|$|Phenotype / cell stem origin The cell {{of origin}} is a {{peripheral}} CD 4 + T-lymphocyte. The immunophenotype of the neoplastic clone is CD 3 + CD 5 + CD 4 + CD 25 -. Rare CD 8 +/CD 4 - cases were observed. Clonality studies demonstrated a monoclonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor (TCR). Epidemiology This {{is the most}} common form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The annual incidence is around 0, 3 cases per 100. 000 in western countries. The median age at diagnosis is between 55 and 60 years, with a 2 / 1 male-to-female ratio. Clinics The disease usually shows cutaneous patches, plaques, tumors or generalized erythroderma (Mycosis fungoides). Pruritus is a common symptom. Extracutaneous manifestations are more frequent in the presence of locally advanced disease (cutaneous tumors). The presence of erythroderma with circulating malignant cells (Sezary's cells) in the peripheral blood (PB) and in the bone marrow is consistent with <b>Sezary's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> which is usually associated with lymphadenopathy. Other sites of involvement in disseminated disease include the lungs, the gastrointestinal tract, the liver and the central nervous system. Pathology The tumor cell is a small lymphocyte with cerebriform nucleus, clumped chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. Epidermotropism by neoplastic CD 4 + lymphocytes with the formation of Pautrier's microabsecsses is the hallmark of the disease. Treatment Phototherapy, radiation therapy and alpha interferon are the mainstay of treatment of cutaneous disease. Chemotherapy using various regimens was employed in cases displaying disseminated disease and in <b>Sezary's</b> <b>syndrome</b> with limited success. Prognosis The clinical stage is the most important indicator. Patient with limited cutaneous disease have an excellent prognosis. Patient with cutaneous tumours, generalized erythroderma, with <b>Sezary's</b> <b>syndrome</b> or extracutaneous disease usually have a short survival, ranging from 1 to 4 years. Cytogenetics Note The neoplastic cells have a low mitotic index and stimulation with phytohemagglutinin and interleuchin- 2 IL- 2) and IL- 7 were used.

40|$|Using {{a series}} of {{monoclonal}} antibodies, the distribution of T-cell subpopulations in the skin and peripheral blood was investigated in 21 patients with a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and 14 patients with benign inflammatory dermatoses, histologically characterized by a bandlike mononuclear infiltrate, e. g., atopic dermatitis, chronic eczema, and lichen planus. In <b>Sézary's</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{the large majority of}} the neoplastic cells, both in the skin and the peripheral blood, reacted with Leu- 1, Leu- 3 a, OKT 3, OKT 4, and TA- 1 antisera (T helper/inducer phenotype). The cutaneous infiltrates in mycosis fungoides showed a predominance of Leu- 3 a+, OKT 4 + cells (T helper/inducer phenotype), varying numbers of Leu- 2 a+, OKT 8 + cells (T cytotoxic/suppressor phenotype), and, in contrast to <b>Sézary's</b> <b>syndrome,</b> not only large numbers of nondendritic HLA-DR+ cells (probably activated T-cells) but also many dendritic nonlymphoid cells expressing HLA-DR and/or OKT 6 antigens, which presumably represent cells of the Langerhans cell/interdigitating reticulum cell series. However, the number of HLA- DR+ cells in the peripheral blood was not increased. In the advanced stages of mycosis fungoides a loss of certain T-cell antigens (Leu- 1, OKT 3, and/or Leu- 3 a and OKT 4) was observed both in the skin and peripheral blood. The distribution of T-cell subsets, OKT 6 + and HLA-DR+ cells in the skin and peripheral blood of patients with atopic dermatitis and chronic eczema was similar as compared to the early stages of mycosis fungoides. These results indicate that the monoclonal antibodies {{used in the present study}} have limited value in discriminating between the early stages of mycosis fungoides and benign inflammatory dermatoses. However, the loss of reactivity with some of these anti-T-cell anti-sera in patients with well-established mycosis fungoides may have prognostic significance...|$|R

They are observed only extra-cellularly; typical budding, however, is not found.

40|$|Abstract. Scabies, {{infection}} with Sarcoptes scabiei, {{is known to}} be predisposed to by poor body hygiene, environmental exposure, and systemic immunodeficiency. We report the case of an 83 -year-old man with <b>Sezary’s</b> <b>syndrome</b> who developed scabies limited to the skin of the upper chest, the same location where he had previously received electron beam radiation treatments for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Histologic and immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that sections of the previously irradiated right and left chest skin, compared to non-irradiated chest, abdominal, and leg skin, had infestation by scabies, diminished involvement by T-cell lymphoma, and notably reduced numbers of Langerhans cells. These findings suggest that the development of scabies may be predisposed to by local cutaneous radiation therapy, and that it may be mediated by local cutaneous immunodeficiency secondary to reduced numbers of Langerhans cells.

40|$|Malignant lymphomas have {{traditionally}} been classified on solely morphological grounds. With new immunological and cytochemical techniques, it has been possible to characterize normal cells of the T-lymphocyte, B-lymphocyte, and monocyte-macrophage system.

Within the B-lymphocyte system {{it is possible to}} identify subpopulations responsible for Burkitt's tumour, follicular (nodular) lymphomas, lymphocytic lymphomas of intermediate differentiation and well differentiated lymphocytic lymphomas. The T-lymphocyte system includes lymphoblastic lymphomas, mycosis fungoides, and <b>Sezary's</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Large-cell lymphomas are diverse, but the majority are tumours of transformed lymphocytes, usually of the B-lymphocyte system.

Serviço de Hematologia, Unidade de Citometria, Hospital Geral de Santo António, Rua D Manuel II, s/n, 4099 - 001 Porto, Portugal. mmc. lima@clix. pt Abstract BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The exact immunophenotypic {{criteria for the}} identification of Sézary cells in the blood are still poorly defined. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the immunophenotype and DNA cell content of blood T cells {{in a series of}} 18 consecutive cases of <b>Sézary's</b> <b>syndrome</b> (SS), 21 normal individuals and 10 patients with reactive erythroderma, and correlated them with molecular and morphological findings. RESULTS: Phenotypically abnormal CD 3 +/TCRalphabeta+/CD 4 + T cells were found in all SS patients but in none of the reactive erythroderma cases; small diploid, or less frequently hypodiploid Sézary's cells coexisted with large nearly tetraploid Sézary's cells in some cases. The most frequent phenotypic aberrations consisted in decreased expression of CD 3 /TCRalphabeta (94 %), CD 4 (94 %), CD 7 (100 %) and/or CD 2 (83 %). In addition, Sézary's cells were constantly CD 28 + and CD 5 + and they did not express natural-killer associated (NKa) antigens. Phenotypic heterogeneity was a common finding and phenotypic changes over time were frequently observed. In contrast to what was found in patients with reactive erythroderma, flow cytometry analysis of the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire revealed a major TCR-Vbeta expansion in all SS cases. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The presence of CD 28 +/CD 5 +/NKa-/CD 4 + T cells expressing abnormally low levels of CD 3, TCRalphabeta, CD 4, CD 7 and/or CD 2 would support the diagnosis of SS in patients with erythroderma. Further analyses on larger series of patients are necessary in order to cover less frequent phenotypic patterns, establish the preferential usage of specific TCR-Vb families and investigate the specificity of these phenotypic abnormalities for diagnosing SS.
