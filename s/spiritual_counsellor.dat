40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to explore the interpretation of religious and spiritual experiences during mania, depression and recovery, from the perspective of bipolar clients and to inquire into their expectations of treatment in relation to these experiences. For this purpose, a qualitative pilot study is designed, which includes interviews with 10 outpatients of Altrecht, a Dutch mental health institution. The meaning of religious and spiritual experiences and the question of their authenticity proved to be an important theme for the participants. The support of spirituality for illness management was brought to the fore, as well as the temporary lack of this support during depression by some participants. Participants considered it desirable that more attention be paid to the topic during treatment, and to establish better cooperation between <b>spiritual</b> <b>counsellors</b> of the institution and other professionals. Thus, a more existential or hermeneutical approach towards religious experiences in relation to bipolar disorder would be a desirable contribution to standard treatment.

40|$|The {{following}} {{article is}} a study about counsellors working with terminally ill patients receiving Palliative care. In an effort to understand {{their role in the}} Palliative team and how they participate in the care of dying individuals, four counsellors working in four different Palliative hospices in Stockholm were interviewed by using structured interviews. The key questions concern the methods and interventions counsellors use, the risk factors that the job entails, the support they receive and finally their reflections about life and death The literature on the topic was accessed via Ersta Sköndal Högskola College library and Internet database. The results of the study reveal that Palliative Care Approach takes into consideration all aspects of an individual (physical, psychological, social and <b>spiritual).</b> <b>Counsellors</b> are part of a multidisciplinary team and their role is to focus on the social and psychological aspects. They undertake comprehensive assessments of the patient’s context and their coping strategies through the use of psychosocial theories such as Sense of Coherence and Logo therapy. Via their skilled use of core counselling skills they establish close relationships with patients and families. At the same time they are always mindful of keeping the right distance. Counsellors are the receivers of a lot of emotional pain and suffering of patients and families and as such this transference can lead to emotional exhaustion. Access to good support is an essential prerequisite for avoiding burnout. Close encounters with death leads to reflections of life and death. Counsellors need to be well developed and experienced in order to provide good quality palliative care...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{improved}} health care {{with regard to}} chronic diseases, population growth and the ageing of the population, the number of chronically ill patients in the Netherlands increased significantly, and will further increase during the coming years. The effects of chronic diseases are reflected in various fields, such as the medical, biological, psychological and/or social field. The concept of quality of life, in which a multi-dimensional perspective is offered to health, has considerably gained ground in healthcare and research in recent decades. However, uncertainty remains {{about the extent to}} which spiritual care effectively contributes to the quality of life of chronically ill patients. In this study, the effects of the contact between <b>spiritual</b> <b>counsellors</b> and 5 chronically ill patients are investigated by means of conducting an interview and a questionnaire consisting of three instruments. With four respondents an increase has been found in the emotional and social quality of life, and with two respondents an increase has also been found in the mental quality of life. Moreover, with two respondents a positive contribution to the use of receptive coping, a form of spiritual coping, has been found. Based on the results of the quantitative instruments, presumption arose that receptive coping is related to the emotional quality of life of chronically ill patients. Finally, the relation between the degree to which chronically ill patients are engaged in spiritual issues concerning illness on one hand and emotional wellbeing on the other hand has been found to be more likely negative than positive...|$|R

In this form of pietism sanctification is overemphasised at the expense of justification. In this article, a basis-theoretical assessment of core elements is followed by empirical-qualitative research data, more specifically the results of narrative analysis. A purposive sample of nine participants was used. The research data was obtained by means of a semi-structured questionnaire that the participants had to com- plete, as well as by a semi-structured interview that was con- ducted with each participant individually. The content analysis of the research data indicates possible reasons why some in- dividuals favour this form of pietism, why some individuals do not favour this doctrine, why some individuals remain sup-porters of this form of pietism, and how some individuals are “freed” from it. Guidelines are given on a practice-theoretical level concerning the way in which the outcome of these results can be applied.

40|$|Background Mental {{disorders}} {{are believed to}} account for {{a large portion of}} disease burden worldwide. However, no national studies have been undertaken to assess this assumption in the Arab world. Methods As part of the WHO World Mental Health (WMH) Survey Initiative, a nationally representative psychiatric epidemiological survey of 2857 adults (aged ⩾ 18 years) was done in Lebanon between September, 2002, and September, 2003, through a study called LEBANON (Lebanese Evaluation of the Burden of Ailments and Needs Of the Nation). 12 -month prevalence and severity of DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition) disorders, and treatment were assessed with the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI, version 3. 0). Information was also obtained for sociodemographics and exposure to traumatic events in the Lebanon wars. Findings 308 (17 · 0 %) of respondents met criteria for at least one 12 -month DSM-IV/CIDI disorder, 108 (27 · 0 %) of whom were classified serious and an additional 112 (36 · 0 %) moderate. Nearly half of respondents had a history of exposure to war-related traumatic events. Significantly elevated odds ratios (OR) of mood, anxiety, and impulse-control disorders were associated with two (OR 2 · 0 – 3 · 6) or more (2 · 2 – 9 · 1) war-related traumatic events, resulting in substantially higher proportions of moderate and severe 12 -month mental disorders in respondents exposed to multiple war-related traumata (16 · 8 – 20 · 4 %) compared with other respondents (3 · 3 – 3 · 5 %). Only 47 (10 · 9 %) respondents with 12 -month disorders obtained treatment. 85 % of people were treated in the general medical sector and the mental-health-care system, and the rest by religious or <b>spiritual</b> advisers, <b>counsellors,</b> herbalists, or fortune-tellers. Interpretation Mental {{disorders are}} common in Lebanon, with a prevalence equivalent to that in Western Europe.

40|$|There {{has been}} little Australian {{research}} on the religious and <b>spiritual</b> values of <b>counsellors</b> - one study only, published by Cross and Khan in 1983. However, this issue is an important one, as counsellors' values may influence their clients and the need of clients may require {{the attention of the}} counsellor to religious and spiritual issues. This study consisted of two surveys in which the religious and spiritual beliefs and values of Australian counsellors were examined. The first study addressed some root questions concerning the relevance of religion and spirituality to psychologists and therapists in the counselling situation. The queries concerned (a) the recognition and acceptance by counselling practitioners of the religious/spiritual dimension of a person, (b) whether religious issues, values and beliefs were seen {{as an integral part of}} psychotherapy and (c) the degree to which these practitioners saw themselves as religious or spiritual. To answer some of these root questions, the initial objective of the field study was to survey psychologists and therapists in Canberra using the Batson and Ventis (1982) Religious Life Inventory, because this was a framework for identifying the ways in which a person was religious. Added to this were some demographic questions and questions regarding the relevance of religion to work. A poor response rate led to the surveys being sent also to Sydney and Melbourne. Results from this first survey were limited. The term "religion" was found to be far more complex than at first realised, and hence objectives were modified for a second survey. The second survey focussed on perceptions of spirituality of Canberra counsellors. The survey questions were based on the studies by Shafranske and Gorsuch (1984) and Shafranske and Malony (1990). Added to these questions were demographic questions and open questions dealing with personal insights, experiences with symbols, rituals and myths. Ideas for questions were also taken from studies on religion in Australia, including Bouma and Dixon (1986) and the Australian Values Study Survey (1983). The data was analysed first by tabling frequencies, then by cross-tabulating selected variables and computing the chi-square statistic for each cross-tabulation to determine whether the relationship was significant at the 0. 05 level. Results suggested that the majority of Canberra practitioners not only perceived spirituality as important to their personal life and clinical work, but also regarded themselves as spiritual people and believed in a transcendent Being and Life Force. Most saw their spirituality as entirely personal and had little connection with organised or traditional religions. Within the counselling relationship approximately half of the counsellors were willing to discuss religious issues, and nearly 90 % to discuss their clients' spirituality. Female counsellors were much more likely than male to discuss a client's religious beliefs with them; other differences between the sexes were less marked. The high response rate in this study together with the significant findings indicate the value of further research in this area on a broader scale...|$|R

40|$|A {{change in}} the {{multicultural}} nature of Australian society over the last generation, a growing acceptance of pluralism and secularism and the exposure through the media of many varied faiths and religious practices has changed the cultural landscape of this country. This, combined with a decline in traditional cultural practices that supported and encouraged involvement and practice in mainstream Christian faiths, has led to many questions being raised as {{to the role of}} spirituality in the life of young people. The situation of increased questioning has been made more complex by the rise in the prominence of fundamentalism in some denominations. Even though society has become more complex, there still exists in all, especially the young, a desire to ask questions around issues of a spiritual nature as this will assist them in the journey towards the articulation of their own identity. Another by-product of a society that embraces daily change and technological advances is an increase in the demand for the helping professions, especially ones of a psychological or counselling nature. In exploring the idea of adolescent male spirituality, the ‘context’ (referring to aspects such as family type, socio-economic status, school environment, social network, ethnicity, religious beliefs and cultural experiences and practices) of an adolescent male’s life was examined. The thesis also takes an in-depth look at developmental theory as relevant to this age group. More importantly, a theoretical framework around the key concepts of personal, professional and <b>spiritual</b> support for <b>counsellors</b> and school leaders who journey with adolescents daily was developed. To achieve this, an investigation into the relationship between spirituality and counselling was undertaken, looking specifically at the spiritual dimensions of the therapeutic relationship and therapeutic approaches to spirituality. The key therapeutic theoretical framework that is explored is cognitive behaviour therapy. This is most appropriate, as it is a structured, short-term, present-oriented psychotherapy directed at solving current problems by modifying biased thinking and behaviour. It can be easily applied to teenagers. The research investigated the role of spirituality in the life of adolescent males in Catholic schools in the Edmund Rice Tradition and any difference that can be made by psychotherapeutic interventions. This was done within the context of looking at developmental theory in its application to adolescents within an educational environment. The research methodology was a combination of qualitative and quantitative research. The initial research method used was the Delphi technique. This technique required the use of an expert panel {{in the process of developing}} the research instruments, thus ensuring relevance and the collection of reliable information. The research at the school stage followed a four level programmatic approach. The four phases were quantitative instrument, qualitative interviews, focus group discussions and the interviews with counsellors and adults. These followed a sequence progression method. The results of the study revealed that adolescent males in a Catholic school in the Edmund Rice Tradition were attentive to a spiritual dimension in their lives. Entry points to this spiritual dimension are different from the traditional expectations typically identified within formal religious traditions. Spiritual engagement was found to be fostered by the experience of personal relationships, involvement in social justice activity and awareness of the impact of the environment on their spiritual journey. An openness exists to share experiences and reflection with counsellors on processes that nurture development across spiritual and associated developmental domains. A specific sensitivity exists to operate with trusted and appropriate adults, such as counsellors in areas of spiritual challenge and growth. An interpretation of results centres around a discussion of spiritual development as a contributing factor to the expression of adolescent identity; student well-being as connected with spiritual development; the developmental stage of adolescence as a sensitive period for enhancing spiritual growth; a significant role for counsellors in supporting the spiritual journey of adolescents; the wider impact that holistic development has on teaching and learning; and the formation of a whole school approach to the support of adolescent spiritual development. A final observation was the need to ensure that the religious dimension of the school is consistent with the spiritual development of the individual. The study concludes that Catholic schools in the Edmund Rice Tradition that proclaim to have a values focused education based on a religious background or tradition must constantly recognise the creative tension that exists between remaining faithful to their mission and meeting the developmental needs of the adolescent males who are coming to school from an increasingly pluralistic and complex society. The changing nature of the adolescents’ search for spirituality and identity also necessitates that existing paradigms that define the response to these questions by church and schools need to be evaluated...|$|R
