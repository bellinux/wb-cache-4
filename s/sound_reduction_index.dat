This paper introduces a 2 -D Harmonic Acoustic Finite Element Analysis to predict the sound insulation of stud based double-leaf walls. This research was motivated by the necessity to develop acoustically efficient light weight building structures, which are both affordable and sustainable. Prediction of the <b>Sound</b> <b>Reduction</b> <b>Index</b> (R) of plasterboard partitions with structural links is a challenging problem due to the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) between the structural and fluid systems. Several finite element models to predict the <b>sound</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>index</b> of double-leaf walls were developed in compliance with BSENISO 717 and 140.

40|$|When a {{sound is}} {{traveling}} from one room to another through a wall, it changes character. In {{most cases the}} wanted change {{is to reduce the}} level of the sound and, different walls do that differently well. A measure of how much the sound is lowered in level is the so-called <b>reduction</b> <b>index,</b> which is dependent on the material properties and geometry of the separating structure, (i. e. the wall). The aim of this work has been to investigate the possibility to construct a computer model for calculating the <b>reduction</b> <b>index</b> of a structure. The finite element method has been used to investigate the vibrations in a structure cased by air-borne sound waves. The vibrations propagate through the structure leading to a radiation of sound on the opposite side. The difference in sound pressure level {{on both sides of the}} structure determines the value of the <b>reduction</b> <b>index</b> for specific structure.

The formulation of the Finite Element and the Modal Approach models is reviewed. In order to draw reliable conclusions on the basis of simulation results, it is essential to demonstrate that the simulations give accurate predictions of the real situations. The simulation of <b>sound</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>index</b> evaluation experiments carried out in two different laboratories is, therefore, reported.
