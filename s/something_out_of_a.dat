[...] Ian MacFarlane, Cho's former classmate, stated that, [...] "when we read Cho's plays, {{it was like}} <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> nightmare. The plays had really twisted, macabre violence that used weapons I wouldn't have even thought of." [...] When Stephen Davis, a senior who was also in Cho's class, read Richard McBeef, {{he turned to his}} roommate and said, [...] "This is {{the kind of guy who}} is going to walk into a classroom and start shooting people."

500|$|Not all reviews were positive, however. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five, writing that [...] "'The Beginning' opens witty enough [...] and then offers the viewer no substance. It's a better season opener than 'Redux' [...] but it's still very poor." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely {{negative}} review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. She derided the episode's plot, noting that the episode was [...] "another mile down the X-Files Road of Mythology. Monster aliens? This is <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> schlocky pulp novel with the science of the show dissolved into complete technobabble".|$|E
500|$|Poole {{refers to}} Eli Gold as a [...] "wartime consigliere", a {{reference}} to the Tom Hagen lawyer character in the 1972 Mafia film The Godfather, which is itself based on a Mario Puzo novel of the same name. In turn, Gold disparagingly refers to Poole as a [...] "Shiksa Bambi", {{a reference to}} the title character of the 1942 Disney animated film Bambi, about a naive deer unaccustomed to the realities and horrors of the real world. Kurt McVeigh's country mannerisms and dress prompt Diane to refer to him as the Marlboro Man, a cowboy-like figure used in tobacco advertisements for Marlboro cigarettes. Upon learning about his morals, Diane said he was like <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> novel by Herman Melville, the 19th century novelist who wrote Moby-Dick and Billy Budd. She also jokingly asks whether Kurt is related to Timothy McVeigh, the man convicted of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, by saying: [...] "Oh my goodness what an unfortunate name. Hopefully no relation." [...] Diane, a liberal, is taken aback by the conservative Kurt's enthusiasm for Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee. As a joke, Kurt sends her a copy of Palin's 2009 memoir, [...] She in turn sends him the parody book Going Rouge: A Candid Look Inside The Mind Of Political Conservative Sarah Palin, which is filled with empty pages.|$|E
500|$|Spin {{reviewed}} the track favourably, {{calling it a}} [...] "celebrity-at-the-crossroads soul ballad" [...] with an [...] "ambient gospel sweep that's both haunted and joyful". Mojo praised the song's musicianship, saying it was [...] "graced by swaggering performances" [...] and that the Edge's [...] "languid guitar solo" [...] was reminiscent of David Gilmour. Q echoed these sentiments, commending Bono's soulful singing and the Edge's solo. The reviewer christened the song as [...] "this album's 'One' or 'With or Without You', with added bonus points". The Washington Post called the song one of the record's highlights and enjoyed the track's gospel qualities. The reviewer wrote, [...] "The vocal harmonies on the choruses sound like <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> church in some distant, dystopian world; the woozy, slightly detuned piano adds to that impression..." [...] Hot Press gave the song a favourable review, calling it a [...] "sweeping" [...] track and suggesting it [...] "conjure the same spiritual vibe as Marvin Gaye's 'Abraham, Martin & John'". Time gave No Line on the Horizon a negative review, but praised [...] "Moment of Surrender" [...] for its [...] "heartbreaking melody" [...] and Bono's [...] "Oh-oh-oh" [...] vocals that reminded the critic {{of the end of}} [...] "With or Without You". Bono and Daniel Lanois both cited the song as their favourite track on the album, and Brian Eno thought the band should have chosen it as the album's first single. [...] Musician Gavin Friday described the song as [...] "Al Green on Irish steroids", and Hot Press editor Niall Stokes called it [...] "a modern rock classic" [...] that will [...] "stand forever as one of U2's most inspirational creations".|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} a mixed response from television critics. IGN contributor Robert Canning said [...] "Flu Shot" [...] {{had a number of}} aspects that he enjoyed, but [...] "as a whole" [...] the episode was not completely satisfying, and reasoned that this episode fell below 30 Rock standards. He said that he personally did not buy the idea of Liz taking a tropical vacation, [...] "hat's just not the Liz I know. But even ignoring this, the bits involved, especially the flashes to Liz on the beach, weren't all that inspired." [...] Canning also was critical of Jack and Elisa's story as he felt it was weak. Overall, he rated the episode a 7.6 out of 10. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote, [...] "Is it just me or was this one of the more lacking episodes of 30 Rock? It's not that it was terrible... but this one just seemed to meander. It wasn't as funny as other episodes... and that whole crew-as-zombies-with-the-flu stuff was a little bit too surreal, even for this show." [...] Further in his review, Sassone wrote that the Tracy and Jenna subplot started funny, but ended [...] "in a lame, predictable manner." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger, also disliked [...] "Flu Shot", opining that it was a disappointment. Sepinwall further added that the Jack and Elisa story [...] "felt like <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bad '80s sitcom – and not even the 30 Rock take on a bad '80s sitcom episode." [...] Sepinwall, however, wrote that the episode did have a good moment with Kenneth suggesting to Tracy that he and Jenna get soup for the sick crew themselves, and with Tracy replying [...] "With what? My arms?".|$|E
2500|$|After the {{box office}} and Academy Awards success of Departures, its filming locations– {{including}} Minato-za– became popular tourist attractions. In June 2009 the cinema was reopened as Sakata Minato-za {{as part of an}} event termed the [...] "Sakata Minato-za Revival Festival" [...] ("港座復活祭"); Takita described the cinema's reopening as being [...] "like <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> movie". Since then the cinema has hosted new screenings, using a DVD player and projector as the original system had decayed too much. It is also used for other activities. [...] On days when not hosting film-viewing events for local groups, the cinema [...] which has 映像とサウンドのきらめき ("Glittering Images and Sound") written on the facade [...] {{is open to the public}} and tour groups.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1960s shops such as Laura Ashley (whose first London outlet opened in 1968) were {{routinely}} promoting the [...] "peasant look" [...] and selling {{a range of}} [...] "uniquely eccentric clothes ... The magic was being able to step into a 'Laura Ashley' dress and imagine you had found <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dressing-up box". At {{around the same time}} too, and into the 1970s, the brassière (or bra), which, as noted, had been seen as a liberating innovation {{in the early part of}} the century, came to be regarded by some women, such as the Australian academic Germaine Greer (The Female Eunuch, 1969), as an unduly restrictive symbol of traditional womanhood. However, the much-publicised incidence of [...] "bra burning" [...] in the 1970s tended to be overstated and came to be satirised: for example, in the 1973 film, Carry On Girls, and a poster by Young & Rubicam, one of a mildly subversive series for Smirnoff vodka: [...] "I never thought of burning my bra until I discovered Smirnoff". It was also seen by many, including Greer herself, as a distraction from the cause of women's [...] "liberation". A Vermont lawyer later observed wryly that [...] "like every good feminist-in-training in the sixties, I burned my bra", but that [...] "now it's the nineties ... I realize Playtex [...] had supported me better than any man I know." [...] Claire Perry, who became a Conservative Member of Parliament in 2010 and later a government minister, reflected that, as a [...] "women's officer" [...] at Oxford University in the early 1980s, she was [...] "a bra-burning feminist with a hideous new-romantic haircut", but that her feminism had, in her view, matured.|$|E
50|$|Garrin {{grew up in}} Camden, New Jersey, in what he {{describes}} as a 50's cheap housing boom neighborhood, like <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> archetypal twilight zone landscape. His understanding of hard times has its roots in childhood experience, when it became necessary for his family to seek public assistance due to his father's joblessness. A registered nurse, his mother got his family through hard times. Surrounded by a conformist mindset that seemed to care for little beyond sports, Garrin studied art as a way out. He took night classes at the Philadelphia College of Art, and worked at an offset printing shop in the day to support himself.|$|R
5000|$|Boris Kustodiev {{was born}} in Astrakhan into the family <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{professor}} <b>of</b> philosophy, history of literature, and logic at the local theological seminary. His father died young, and all financial and material burdens fell on his mother's shoulders. The Kustodiev family rented a small wing in a rich merchant's house. It was there that the boy's first impressions were formed {{of the way of}} life of the provincial merchant class. The artist later wrote, [...] "The whole tenor of the rich and plentiful merchant way of life was there right under my nose... It was like <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Ostrovsky play." [...] The artist retained these childhood observations for years, recreating them later in oils and water-colours.|$|R
500|$|Critics {{were divided}} about Rick Grimes' return to Atlanta, {{as well as}} his stand off with Guillermo and his gang. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic {{compared}} Grimes to Mad Men Don Draper, and questioned his character development: [...] "So far, every decision Rick has made has been both within his code and consequence-free," [...] he said. Pierce opined: [...] "Dramatically, this whole sequence plays out pretty hokily. Guillermo's dialogue is ridiculous, and the entire storyline plays like <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> episodic social-lesson-of-the-week show. Since nothing ends up coming <b>of</b> it from <b>a</b> plot standpoint , it's hard not {{to think of it as}} one of those comics where two [...] have a big fight scene that turns out to be mistaken identity." ...|$|R

5000|$|Urban Yeti! {{received}} mostly average {{reviews from}} critics, who praised the game's humor but criticized its technical problems; it received a 67% and a 68.71% from review aggregate websites Metacritic and GameRankings respectively. IGN's Craig Harris criticized the game's slow frame rate and technical problems, stating, [...] "... {{because of the}} loose and sloppy presentation it ends up feeling like a game produced by a few guys down in someone's basement...instead <b>of</b> <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> established development studio." [...] Allgame's Brett Alan Weiss noted that the game had charming moments, but ultimately had little replay value and had too many graphical problems. GameZone's Scott Kuvin felt that the collision detection of the game had some glitches, but felt that the game's humor overcame any technical problems.|$|R

Nevertheless, it's still their best for ages - a gentle, wistful piano song that recalls Sister <b>of</b> Mercy with <b>an</b> appropriately anguished middle bit.

2500|$|Electronic Design {{called the}} game a [...] " [...] wacky parody" [...] that reimagines the {{well-known}} island as <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> industrial nightmare. In the Eyes of the Setting Sun deemed it [...] "satirical", while BusinessWeek thought all of Parrot Interactive's work was [...] "hilarious". Billboard {{found it to}} be funnier than Myst and [...] "all-to-short". Plotting New Media Frontiers thought that the existence of parody games demonstrated that [...] "generic conventions are well established and part of the culture associated with computer game playing", citing Pyst as a prime example. Computer Shopper said the title was [...] "no-holds-barred" [...] and [...] "pulls no punches" [...] in its odd sense of humour, and deemed it a favourable alternative to those who were annoyed by Myst's [...] "inscrutable puzzles". CD Mag thought the game was [...] "somewhat witty". Emil Pagliarulo of The Adrenaline Vault saw Pyst as <b>an</b> example <b>of</b> how Parrot Interactive made games that were [...] "completely original simply by capitalizing on unoriginality".|$|R

5000|$|Forti's first {{development}} of her Dance Constructions series was publicly presented at New York City's Reuben Gallery in December 1960, {{in an exhibition}} Forti shared with Jim Dine and Claes Oldenburg, titled Happenings at the Reuben Gallery. During this exhibition, Robert Morris and Yvonne Rainer performed See Saw, and Forti and Patty Mucha (then Patty Oldenburg, Claes Oldenburg's then-spouse) performed Roller Boxes (then titled Rollers) with the contributions of audience members. In Thinking With the Body (2014, University of Chicago Press and Hirmer), curator Sabine Breitwieser wrote about Forti's Dance Constructions, [...] "One could look at the Dance Constructions as problematizing everyday or, as you call them, pedestrian movements. If you take <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> everyday context and isolate it, then it becomes something else. Using a rope to scale a steep ramp in Slant Board, for instance, evokes a typical climbing movement, but you've turned it to an isolated action that lacks a purpose, that exists just for itself." ...|$|R
