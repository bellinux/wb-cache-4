40|$|Hegel and Eliot {{have been}} chosen for this study not because of their {{differences}} but because of <b>similarities</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thought.</b> Although most of Hegel's works are obscure and pedantic, {{it is possible to}} show that his early thinking reflects a deep awareness of many of the implications of the new age. A growing number of philosophers and theologians today are apparently "rediscovering" Hegel as one who caught a vision of the transition in man's history and whose insights are valuable today...|$|R
40|$|Bernard Lonergan's {{understanding}} of the developing subject is conceived concretely {{in terms of the}} broadening horizon of the subject towards a real apprehension of the human good, from particular good to the notion of value. I will argue that Lonergan's {{understanding of}} the developing subject is a complex phenomenon rooted in the self-transcending existential subject's freedom and apprehension of value, which precedes decision-making and which orients the course of one's personal development. An analysis of Bernard Lonergan's {{understanding of the}} development of the subject reveals that he drew heavily from the psychologist Abraham Maslow. My main purpose is to retrieve Lonergan's insights on personal development by comparing to what extent his thinking is similar to and different from that of Maslow's. I will argue that although there are <b>similarities</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thought,</b> the perspectives they offer regarding human nature are reached from within very different horizons, and therefore their understanding of personal development, although complimentary, is foundationally different. In the final chapter I offer suggestions for merging the two thinkers' thought in order to provide a more complete understanding of personal development which takes seriously considerations from both psychology and theology...|$|R
40|$|By {{utilizing}} the library research method, this paper aims at analysing {{the influences of}} Shah Waliullah on the thoughts of Sayyid Abul A‘la Mawdudi. Shah Waliullah (1703 - 1762) {{was one of those}} great Islamic thinkers who by the virtue of their knowledge and activities helped reconstruct the sociopolitical and religious thought in Islam. Waliullah bridged between medieval and modern Islam in India. He was a socio-political reformer, a great Islamic scholar, a Sufi, a reformist and an Islamic missionary worker, all at the same time. Mawdudi (1903 - 1979) was greatly influenced by the thought and teachings of Waliullah. He was an expounder of Islam during the 20 th century. Both of them have presented Islam as a complete code of life with solutions to all problems faced by mankind. In line with Waliullah’s thought, Mawdudi chalked out a strategy to establish an Islamic State and initiated a powerful movement to translate Islamic ideology into a realizable term for the reconstruction of socio-political life in accordance with Islamic ideology. However, Mawdudi did not accept every thought of Waliullah uncritically. He disagreed with Waliullah on several issues including Islamic mysticism. Yet, <b>similarities</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thoughts</b> are overwhelming. Both initiated a process of socio-political change <b>in</b> <b>their</b> respective times, inspired by Islamic ideal. This paper focuses on the similarities of thought between the two scholars in terms of ideology, socio-political and religious reform, emphasis on the independent judgement or the Ijtihad...|$|R
40|$|Public {{places in}} modern urban areas play an undeniable role in {{enhancing}} {{the quality of}} life within cities. Like any other urban space, public places need to be carefully planned and designed to perform their task as a venue for social interactions in cities. Consequently, for a space to present itself in a unique manner, it needs special setting and feature. Therefore, Questions are raised as for the criteria of successful public space’s environment. This study examines the features, which creates the environment of a space and influence human behavior within it, through categorizing the features into physical feature such as edge, size, landscape, and non-physical such as sound, smell and illumination. The categories are structured to form a three level hierarchical model, which comprised of features, criteria, and sub-criteria. The model is an outcome of literature review and current guidelines analysis. Furthermore, to identify the values of these criteria and their sub-criteria, a ranking questionnaire was developed and distributed over two groups of respondent – professionals and young people. The respondents are assumed to share the same aim of having functional public space within their urban environment. The result of the responses showed that professionals and young people have evaluated the criteria in different manner; although there was <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thoughts.</b> Nevertheless, the study found that, some of the important criteria according to the respondents were not addressed in the current guideline. Hence, this study recommends some additional guidelines regarding the non-physical criteria of spaces, such as sound, smell and illumination in public place, for the current documents to include...|$|R
40|$|Readily {{acknowledged}} {{as two of}} the intellectual giants of twentieth century French thought, Jean-Paul Sartre and Michel Foucault are typically depicted as philosophical opposites. Sartre and Foucault are certainly distinct philosophers, but such a portrayal all too often obscures important <b>similarities</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thought.</b> This thesis, by arguing that Sartre and Foucault are not worlds apart {{on the question of}} freedom, attempts to bridge the distance that is commonly regarded to exist between these two. This task is accomplished by bringing to light specific affinities between Sartre and Foucault on the issue of freedom that occur at different junctures <b>in</b> <b>their</b> oeuvres. By proceeding with a critical intention in mind, this thesis provides an interpretative analysis that elucidates three important similarities between Sartre and Foucault: first, it will be shown that when Foucault, in his later thought, unequivocally raises the issue of freedom, he proposes an ethical orientation that is not markedly different from the one suggested by Sartre in his early existentialism. Both Sartre and Foucault put forth an ethical motive that relates to the creativity of the subject. It will be argued that this idea of creative freedom, implicit in Sartre's notion of authentic freedom and explicit in Foucault's proposal for an aesthetics of existence, can be related to an historical idea of artistic freedom, specifically, the autonomy that modern art promises. By showing that the concept of freedom which modern art presumes is a contentious issue, this thesis also argues that the idea of creative freedom in Sartre and Foucault is nothing less than an empty ethical suggestion. By tracing the theme of the gaze in Sartre and Foucault, the next motive will to be show that <b>their</b> <b>thought</b> is motivated by a similar recognition: the notion that humans gaze upon themselves and their world through an objective lens that limits freedom. It will be argued that this insight can be associated with another insight that Sartre and Foucault share: the idea that universal morality is impossible. Although morality, in the eyes of Sartre and Foucault, is impossible, it will be argued that their political activity, while not revealing a universal moral project, nevertheless discloses an ethical impetus. The final convergence that will be presented is that Sartre and Foucault, via different avenues, illustrate that freedom takes place in a socio-historical field that governs and determines its possibilities. Although this conclusion is a result of each thinker's engagement with history, it will be argued that neither Sartre or Foucault presents a convincing way out of this historical nightmare. In fact, by considering the implications of their refusal to introduce an idea of the good into the social field, it will be shown that both reduce the status of freedom to a negative concept...|$|R
40|$|The {{critics of}} Charles Peguy have often {{noted in his}} {{writings}} the influence of Blaise Pascal. This influence, however, has been only alluded to and never studied in detail. This thesis proposed then to measure exactly {{the nature of the}} influence, to define it, and to see precisely in what context one must consider it. This entails, primarily, a close reading of the works of Peguy to discover just how similar to Pascal's his ideas might be, then a retracing of the source of those ideas which resemble Pascal's to find if they actually derive from those of the seventeenth century author. The reader of Peguy and Pascal must notice immediately the remarkable <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thoughts</b> and expression, and Peguy often admits that this similarity is due to a precise influence of Pascal. This is not true, however, in all cases where critics have alluded to an influence. There is often only an affinity or coincidence. The most important lesson learned by Peguy in his reading of Pascal is that of the misery and greatness in the human condition, like Pascal, Peguy leaned most on the pessimistic side of the dialectic: he is most like Pascal in his stress of the misery which he believed necessary for any religious conversion. Peguy also owes to Pascal the revelation that there are orders in reality, in states of mind, in modes of knowledge, or in political bodies which cannot be reduced to one another. Pascal’s ideas of "diversion”, of the bet, of the insertion of the eternal in the temporal, among others, show up again in the writings of Peguy. Other comparisons made by the critics are often artificial. It is true that Peguy's famous dialectic between the mystical and the political can be used to explain Pascal's position in the Provinciales against what he calls the "politics" of the Jesuits. But it is not to be supposed that in the Provinciales lies the source of Peguy's concept. Where critics have inferred an influence, they should have often been more conservative <b>in</b> <b>their</b> observations. Peguy took from Pascal several essential ideas, but his enthusiasm for the famous Christian was limited in early years by his own socialism and collectivism; in later years by the Jansenism and asceticism he discovered in Pascal. There are several of Peguy's texts which indicate his attentive and passioned reflexion on several of Pascal’s texts; the most notable is Clio 1 where one finds a vocabulary definitely "pascalien". Important as these texts may be, though, they are sporadic. Peguy's thoughts evolve from his reflexions on Pascal, but the end product in the development is usually dissimilar to the initial one. His ideas go beyond the limits of Pascal's. Phe encounter Peguy had with the writings of Pascal, as explained by Professor Boutroux at the Sorbonne in 1897, was a lasting one. It was a decisive shock, an "intellectual" emotion, that affected his entire slow return to Christianity. Pascal was for Peguy one of his "authors", one of the essential "fidelities" of his life...|$|R
40|$|Similar {{tendencies in}} the work of {{philosophers}} Ludwig Wittgenstein and Jacques Derrida appear <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thoughts</b> on language and lead to <b>similarities</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> respective ethical <b>thought.</b> <b>Their</b> views are such that {{the way in which they}} conceive the operation of meaning lead to a stance that rejects the possibility of total knowledge or command of concepts, and therefore refuses the idea of a "correct" account of meaning, morality, history, knowledge, and so on. This thesis is an attempt to identify and elaborate the overlap between Wittgenstein and Derrida's work in light of the role that proper names play <b>in</b> <b>their</b> philosophies of language and ethics. The philosophical account of proper names is important because it clarifies the view of subjectivity and also serves as a model for understanding the general operation of language. The fact that we are revealed to be inextricably dependent on the "otherness" of other people in order for each of us to be "selves" implies we are indebted to others and therefore must initiate any ethical project based on that indebtedness. Furthermore, the instability of language insures that we cannot have the "correct" interpretation of all concepts and must therefore maintain a certain charity in our dialogical engagement with others. This thesis argues in favour of the ethical stance that results from Wittgenstein and Derrida's perspective...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Whitman {{influenced}} greatly {{on modern}} Arabic poetry {{in general and}} its prose poetry in particular through Gibran Khalil Gibran, the most famous and important Arabic immigrant poet that had ever lived in America for a long time. We can find in Gibran and Whitman’s works that they shared strong <b>similarity</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> poetics and <b>thoughts.</b> Gibran’s prose poetry, first of all, is of the same origin as Whitman’s in his creative language. Both of them are adept at creating original images by ingenious combination of words. In the second place, just like Whitman’s poetry, Gibran’s works possess an awfully aesthetic sense of music. Like Whitman, Gibran uses graceful rhythm to manifest musical aesthetic feeling in his production. In the third place, both of Whitman and Gibran are good at using colors. Some of their poems are almost a collection of colors. Gibran and Whitman also express some similar <b>thoughts</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> works. Both of them did not advocate the tradition so much Gibran is as sharp as Whitman in his rebellious spirit. Also, it is very explicit that both of Whitman and Gibran are mystic. We’ll focus our discussion on their characteristics of pantheism and natural occultism...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} reflections {{are intended}} as a preliminary to a more extended and in-depth series of case studies, focused analyses of actual artworks, and the issues arising from their particularity within what will be described here as a Heideggerian post-aesthetic aesthetics. The essay is not written {{from the perspective of}} a professional or academic philosopher or of a practising artist (even though I am one), neither fields of which have sufficiently engaged with the existential and aesthetic predicament sketched out below. Thus, the attraction of both Heidegger and Blanchot is not just related to their well-known discussions of inbetween-ness, but, more essentially, to the peculiarly in-between location of <b>their</b> own <b>thought</b> and trajectory of thinking: Heidegger from out of philosophy drawn towards art; Blanchot from within the space of literature towards the exteriority of ontological thinking. The intention is to identify <b>similarities</b> and differences <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thought,</b> but this is only perceived as relevant to the extent that it allows an initial reassessment of a de-subjectivized existential and aesthetic mode of thinking that has been largely abandoned by academic philosophy and art practice alike (albeit for very different reasons). If nothing else, the hope is that a different voice might be heard in the clamorous exchange between philosopher and artists, one that is sensitive to the complex predicament of the artist in a post-Heidegerrian world, and which above all remains faithful to the project of the artist and the artwork in the face of the philosophical valorization of Art...|$|R
