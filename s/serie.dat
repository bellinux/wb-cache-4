After joining Juventus in 2001, Buffon immediately won <b>Serie</b> A titles in both of his first two seasons at the club, and established himself as one of the best players in the world in his position. After winning two more consecutive league titles in 2005 and 2006, the club were later stripped of these titles and relegated due to their involvement in the 2006 Italian football scandal. Despite rumours of his departure, Buffon remained with Juventus, contributing to the club's <b>Serie</b> B title and promotion back to <b>Serie</b> A in 2007. Following several trophyless seasons, Buffon later played a key role in Juventus' resurgence, which saw the club win an Italian record of six consecutive league titles between 2011 and 2017; he also inherited the captain's armband following the departure of Alessandro Del Piero in 2012.

His professional debut came on 12 May 2007, in the <b>Serie</b> B match against Bologna; he came on as a substitute in place of Raffaele Palladino, and marked his first appearance with an assist for David Trezeguet's tap-in. Since then, he had been tipped to be Alessandro Del Piero's heir in the creative number 10 role behind the main striker, known as the trequartista, rifinitore, or fantasista, in Italian. Juventus won the <b>Serie</b> B title that season, earning promotion to <b>Serie</b> A the following season.|$|E
5|$|Henry left Monaco in January 1999, {{one year}} before his {{intimate}} and closest teammate David Trezeguet, and moved to Italian <b>Serie</b> A club Juventus for £10.5million.
