These are mainly due to timevarying physical processes which are sometime unknown. The use of adaptive filtering that diminishes and eliminates the signal distortion completely.

2500|$|When {{government}} statisticians compile gross {{fixed capital}} formation (GFCF) figures, they usually add in [...] "ownership transfer costs" [...] (fees, taxes, charges, insurance costs, installation costs etc.) {{associated with the}} acquisition of a fixed asset put in place. In the United States, these costs represent around 1% of GDP, or around 4.5% of total fixed investment. This inclusion may be perfectly valid {{for the purpose of}} a realistic gross investment measure, but when GFCF data is subsequently used to extrapolate the value of fixed capital stocks using the PIM (the perpetual inventory method), it includes elements which are, strictly speaking, not part of the value of fixed assets themselves. It appears [...] "as if" [...] ownership transfer costs are incurred and depreciated each year in the lifetime of fixed assets, since the value of these costs is carried forward in the perpetual inventory (unless a <b>special</b> <b>adjustment</b> is made). This has the effect of raising the fixed capital stock estimate above true value, cumulatively.|$|E
2500|$|The British {{researchers}} Richard Harris & Stephen Drinkwater also {{highlighted the}} problem that the PIM {{does not account for}} premature scrapping. The reason is that a constant depreciation rate (based on average asset lives) is applied for the stock; a discrepancy therefore arises between depreciated value and scrap value (often statisticians also fail to track what happens to fixed assets that are got rid of, and therefore the assets can be counted twice in the same year). The mathematical problem is that, given a constant depreciation rate, the effect of overstated stock values in the data will increase cumulatively across a series of years, unless a <b>special</b> <b>adjustment</b> is made. Thus, Harris & Drinkwater's 2000 study of fixed capital in British manufacturing 1970–1993 (23 years) found that, if the effect of capital scrapping which occurs due to plant closures is ignored from the 1969 benchmark onward, then this will lead to a 1993 capital stock estimate for plant and machinery which is 44% larger than it is when an appropriate adjustment is made for premature asset disposals. Another depreciation measurement problem is the accelerating replacement of fixed assets, particularly of computer systems, affecting estimated asset lives and therefore average depreciation rates. These two factors alone could, according to a 1997 OECD paper, make a difference of 10% to the estimate of the annual capital stock for some UK industries. Dutch and French statisticians suggested that if capital scrapping is ignored, capital stock results obtained with the PIM could be up to 20% larger than they probably are. New Zealand statisticians acknowledge explicitly that [...] "PIMs may typically overstate the gross capital stock because of a failure to account for changing cyclical or accelerating rates of retirements". Although he is not a Marxist, Thomas Piketty usefully discusses many problems with the PIM. Unlike orthodox classical revolutionary Marxist academics, Piketty and Zucman did not use the PIM method to get a measure of the capital stock, but instead used book values and corporate equity at market value.|$|E

30|$|Since the {{implementation}} of the chained equations algorithm is computationally expensive for large datasets, a random sample of size n = 20, 000 was obtained, from which forty imputations were generated.

It was assumed that the missing data mechanism is missing at random (MAR) (Little and Rubin 2002), which specifies that the probability that a data value is missing depends on values of variables that were actually measured. Including as many variables in the imputation model as possible yields multiple imputations that tend to minimize bias and make the MAR assumption more plausible, which reduces the need to make <b>special</b> <b>adjustments</b> for more complex missing data mechanisms (Schafer 1997).|$|R

(Sometimes a separate spring or smaller weight provides fine tuning.) Stylus forces of 10 to 20 mN (1 to 2 grams-force) are typical for modern consumer turntables, while forces of up to 50 mN (5 grams) are common for the tougher environmental demands of party deejaying or turntablism.

30|$|In summary, {{this was}} the first study showing higher levels of C 4 cycle key enzymes and <b>special</b> <b>adjustments</b> in the {{photosynthetic}} machinery in rice mid-veins. The linear electron transport chain was mostly blocked by a “traffic jam” occurring on PSII complexes, whereas PSI in mid-veins is sufficient to support a larger cyclic one. The loss-of-function of PSII was primarily attributed to selective subunits, such as PsbP and PsbQ of OEC and PsbR. These attributes of photosynthetic machinery in rice mid-veins partly resemble that in the BS cells of C 4 plants, as mentioned in Introduction. Hence, our findings indicate that the photosynthetic cells surrounding mid-veins in the rice, a typical C 3 monocot, innately possess C 4 -like features as do other C 3 dicots. Of course, {{further research is needed to}} extend these findings to more C 3 plants. Such studies would provide a simple explanation for the polyphyletic evolution of C 4 photosynthesis (Hibberd and Quick 2002).|$|R

30|$|While {{the above}} methods are {{adequate}} for fitting uncensored survival data, <b>special</b> <b>adjustments</b> and some novelty {{is needed to}} ensure the effectiveness of GLDs is maintained for survival data with censoring. The methods proposed in this paper: direct maximum likelihood estimation, matching partial probability weighted moments and simulating-refitting method all extend the methods developed in Su (2007 b, 2007 a, 2010 a, 2010 b) to facilitate a successful GLD fit to survival data. Although the theoretical justifications of these methods for fitting any statistical distributions to data {{can be found in}} the literature (Aldrich 1997, Fisher 1922, Hosking 1990), it is unclear how these methods would perform in the case of GLDs. This article aims to fill these gaps in literature by describing the mathematical development of these fitting methods for GLDs and illustrate the typical performance of GLDs through extensive simulations (Simulation studies) and some real life data examples. Various discussions on the practical issues of fitting distribution to survival data such as modelling multi-stage disease scenario (Application in multi-stage disease modelling) and the difference between controlled simulation performance and real life performance (Application in empirical data modelling) are also presented in this article.|$|R

A holistic, multi-disciplinary approach enhancing integration in training and work is emphasised throughout all of the foreseen project activities. The Social Return approach will be established in several different communities in Europe, recognising the reality of the need to rehabilitate individuals into the reality of individuals’ own communities.
