5000|$|The European sprat, <b>Sprattus</b> <b>sprattus,</b> {{also known}} as bristling, brisling or skipper, is a small, herring-like, marine fish. Found in European waters, it has silver grey scales and white-grey flesh. Specific seas in which the species occurs include the Irish Sea, Black Sea, Baltic Sea and Sea of the Hebrides. [...] The fish has about 12% fat in its flesh and {{is a source of}} many vitamins. When used for food it can be canned, salted, fried, grilled, baked, marinated, and so on.|$|E
50|$|The {{variety of}} {{habitats}} {{and the large}} volume of plankton on the surface support prolific marine life. Energy moves from the top to the bottom according to Vinogradov's ladder of migrations; that is, some species are benthic and others pelagic, but there are graded marine layers within which species move vertically for short distances. In addition, some species are benthopelagic, moving between surface and bottom. The benthic species include Coryphaenoides rupestris, Argentina silus, Etmopterus spinax, Chimaera monstrosa and Glyptocephalus cynoglossus. On the top are Clupea harengus, Scomber scombrus, <b>Sprattus</b> <b>sprattus.</b> Some species that move between are Pandalus borealis, Sabinea sarsi, Etmopterus spinax.|$|E
50|$|The {{thiamine}} deficiency syndrome M74 {{is related}} to the fat and thiamine content of prey fish. The diet of Baltic salmon leads to thiamine deficiency in eggs and consequently to the mortality of yolk-sac fry: The main prey species of the Baltic salmon are sprat (<b>Sprattus</b> <b>sprattus)</b> and herring (Clupea harangus membras). Average fat content is greater in sprat than in herring. The fat content is highest and the thiamine concentration is lowest in the youngest sprat. The need for thiamine depends on the amount of fat in the diet. Thiamine deficiency in eggs results from an unbalanced diet abundant in fatty prey fish, such as young sprat, from which the supply of thiamine is insufficient in proportion to the supply of energy and unsaturated fatty acids for salmon.|$|E
5000|$|Fish of the {{different}} species of sprat are found {{in various parts of}} the world including New Zealand, Australia, and parts of Europe. By far, the most highly studied location where the sprat, most commonly <b>Sprattus</b> <b>sprattus,</b> resides is the Baltic Sea, located in Northern Europe. The Baltic Sea provides the sprat with a highly diverse environment, with spatial and temporal potential allowing for successful reproduction. One of the most well-known locations in the Baltic Sea where they forage for their food is the Bornholm Basin, located in the southern portion of the Baltic Sea. Although the Baltic Sea has undergone several ecological changes during the last two decades, the sprat has dramatically increased in population. [...] One of the environmental changes that has occurred in the Baltic Sea since the 1980s includes a decrease in water salinity, due to a lack of inflow from the North Sea that contains high saline and oxygen content.|$|E

Emptying of indigestible solids, barium sulphate spheroids and ballotini were also studied. Additionally stomach contents of whiting sampled from Red Wharf Bay, Eastern Anglesey, UK. were analysed to determine diet composition, diel feeding periodicity and feeding strategy of whiting. Daily and total annual intake of main prey taxa, sprat, sandeel and crab, were estimated. Finally feeding behaviour of whiting in captivity was monitored. With respect to the studies conducted under laboratory conditions, it was found that gastric emptying is best described by a linear function. The results indicated significant changes in gastric emptying rates with both prey type and size. The seasonal change in temperature did not yield a significant change in gastric emptying rate. Increase in diet surface area also did not alter the gastric emptying rate significantly. The results have also shown that in continuously- feeding whiting gastric emptying is affected by the second meal such that the arrival of the second meal is accompanied by rapid emptying of {{a small fraction of the}} first meal. Despite difficulties encountered with individual variation among whiting of similar size held under similar conditions, gastric emptying times (GET) for both natural food and formulated pellets can be adequately predicted by the equations: GET = 126. 47 W - 0. 111 g 0. 26 e - 0. 068 T for the natural food, GET = 6. 6 e - 0. 09 T + 2. 48 W 0. 566 e - 0. 044 T for the formulated pellets; where W is the fish weight (g), S is the meal size (g) and T is the temperature (°C) suggesting that a similar meal size of formulated pellet is emptied faster than natural food, <b>Sprattus</b> <b>sprattus.</b> This was interpreted as evidence that natural diets may reflect a combination of 2 factors (a) the relative size of stimulation to the stomach (...|$|E

This indicates that data from individual colonies may be less useful than regional numbers when using seabirds as indicators. Tern breeding numbers in the region were reduced when the sprat stock (<b>Sprattus</b> <b>sprattus)</b> collapsed in the early 1980 s after targeted fishing, but recovered during recent decades when the stock was unfished.

Bottom-up processes and climate–hydrological forces had a weaker influence on sprat and zooplankton, whereas phytoplankton variation was explained solely by top-down mechanisms.

40|$|During the 1990 s, {{a spatial}} {{shift of the}} {{population}} of Eurytemora affinis (Copepoda, Calanoida) from brackish water towards lower salinities in the Schelde estuary coincided with an increase in oxygen concentration in the freshwater zone.

A total of 24 prey taxa were identified {{but only a few}} species contributed substantially to the diet. The estimated diet composition was, independently of the prey number estimation method and diet composition estimation model used, dominated by herring (Clupea harengus), both by numbers and biomass. In addition to herring, common whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) and sprat (<b>Sprattus</b> <b>sprattus)</b> were important prey, but cyprinids (Cyprinidae), eelpout (Zoarces viviparus), flounder (Platichtys flesus) and salmon (Salmo salar) also contributed significantly. Our results indicated dietary differences between grey seals of different age as well as between seals from the northern (Gulf of Bothnia) and the southern (Baltic Proper) Baltic Sea. </div...|$|E
