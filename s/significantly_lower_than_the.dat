The U.S. Coast Guard received a report of an overdue sailing vessel en route to the Hawaiian Island group. However, it is unknown if Pauline or Rick affected the boat's course.|$|E
5|$|At the 2001 UK census, {{the urban}} area of Poulton-le-Fylde had a {{population}} of 18,264. The 2001 population density for Wyre was 3.74per hectare, with a 100 to 90.7 female-to-male ratio. The proportion of residents who classified themselves as White was 98.9%, a figure {{higher than the average}} for the North West (94.4%) and England (90.9%). Those classifying themselves as belonging to ethnic minorities were correspondingly lower than the regional and national averages. Of those over 16 years old, 22.5% were single (never married), 46.0% married and 8.49% divorced. Although the proportion of divorced people was {{similar to that of the}} North West and England, the rates of those who were married were higher than the regional and national averages (North West: 42.8%; England: 43.5%).

5|$|In {{cases of}} self {{consumption}} of the solar energy, the payback time {{is calculated based on}} how much electricity is not purchased from the grid. For example, in Germany, with electricity prices of 0.25 €/kWh and insolation of 900 kWh/kW, one kWp will save €225 per year, and with an installation cost of 1700 €/KWp the system cost will be returned in less than seven years. However, in many cases, the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide, and {{some or all of the}} energy is fed back into the grid. The electricity is sold, and at other times when energy is taken from the grid, electricity is bought. The relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics. In many markets, the price paid for sold PV electricity is <b>significantly</b> <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> price of bought electricity, which incentivizes self consumption. Moreover, separate self consumption incentives have been used in e.g. Germany and Italy. Grid interaction regulation has also included limitations of grid feed-in in some regions in Germany with high amounts of installed PV capacity. By increasing self consumption, the grid feed-in can be limited without curtailment, which wastes electricity.|$|E
5|$|The closed-shell {{electron}} configuration of flerovium {{results in the}} metallic bonding in metallic flerovium being weaker than in the preceding and following elements; thus, flerovium {{is expected to have}} a low boiling point, and has recently been suggested to be possibly a gaseous metal, similar to the predictions for copernicium, which also has a closed-shell {{electron configuration}}. The melting and boiling points of flerovium were predicted in the 1970s to be around 70°C and 150°C, <b>significantly</b> <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> values for the lighter group 14 elements (those of lead are 327°C and 1749°C respectively), and continuing the trend of decreasing boiling points down the group. Although earlier studies predicted a boiling point of ~1000°C or 2840°C, this is now considered unlikely because of the expected weak metallic bonding in flerovium and that group trends would expect flerovium to have a low sublimation enthalpy. Recent experimental indications have suggested that the pseudo-closed shell configuration of flerovium results in very weak metallic bonding and hence that flerovium is probably a gas at room temperature with a boiling point of around −60°C.|$|E
