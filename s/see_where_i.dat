Breaking the women's 50-metre freestyle {{record in the}} morning's heats, Mortimer lowered it again to 28.12 in the finals. In the S10 100-metre backstroke, she broke the European record in the morning's heats {{and again in the}} final. Although she won a gold medal, she told the IPC website: [...] "I wanted a world record. I'm not satisfied, I'm not super happy. That wasn't the perfect race.

40|$|We {{consider}} numerical semigroups N∩NI, for intervals I. We {{compute the}} Frobenius number and multiplicity of such semigroups, {{and show that}} we may freely restrict I to be open, closed, or half-open, as we prefer. Mathematics Subject Classification (2000) : 20 M 10, 20 M 14 Consider an interval I ⊆ Q> 0. Set S(I) = {m ∈ N: ∃ n ∈ N, mn ∈ I}. This {{turns out to be}} a numerical semigroup, and has been the subject of considerable recent investigation (see Chapter 4 of [2] for an introduction). Special cases include modular numerical semigroups (<b>see</b> [4]) <b>where</b> <b>I</b> = [mn, m n− 1] (m,n ∈ N), proportionally modular numerical semigroups (<b>see</b> [3]) <b>where</b> <b>I</b> = [mn, m n−s] (m,n, s ∈ N), and opened modular numerical semigroups (<b>see</b> [5]) <b>where</b> <b>I</b> = (mn, m n− 1) (m,n ∈ N). We consider instead arbitrary open intervals I = (a, b). We show that this set of semigroups coincides with the set of semigroups generated by closed and half-open intervals. Consequently, this class of semigroups contains modular numerical semigroups, proportionally modular numer-ical semigroups, as well as opened modular numerical semigroups. We also compute two important invariants of these numerical semigroups: the Frobenius number g(S(I)) and multiplicity m(S(I)). 1. PRELIMINARIES We begin by defining a helpful function κ(a, b). For a, b ∈ R with a 0. In the special case of a = mn, b = m n−s...|$|R
