5|$|Mother Gothel {{has been}} mostly well {{received}} by film critics, who enjoyed the character's humor, complexity, charisma and showmanship, dubbing her a scene stealer, while praising Murphy's performance enthusiastically. However, some critics felt that Gothel was <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> passive – a weaker, less intimidating Disney villainess than Maleficent from Sleeping Beauty (1959) and Cruella de Vil from One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961).|$|E
5|$|Sam Elliott as General Thunderbolt Ross: A four-star {{general and}} estranged father of Betty. Ross was {{responsible}} for prohibiting David Banner from his lab work after learning of his dangerous experiments. Elliott felt his performance was similar to his portrayal of Basil L. Plumley in We Were Soldiers. Elliott accepted the role without reading the script, being <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> excited to work with Ang Lee. In addition Elliot also researched Hulk comic books for the part.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 {{legislation}} did {{not include}} a specific sunset clause to change the allocation of units to firms that undertake emissions-intensive and trade-exposed activities. The legislation stipulates that allocations must be reviewed no less than once every 5 years by a review panel. In late 2009, Climate Change Minister Nick Smith stated that estimates of fiscal impacts beyond 2020 at the present time are meaningless as there are <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> many unknowns.|$|E

5|$|The route {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{difficult}} in the modern history of the race, with substantial criticism that it was <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> hard for a three-week-long race. Of the seven stages categorized as 'high mountain', six had summit arrivals, highlighted by the three stages before the second rest day ending at Grossglockner in Austria, the exceptionally steep Monte Zoncolan, and a tall and steep peak near the Fascia Valley in Gardeccia. There was also, for the fifth consecutive Giro, a climbing time trial, this one to the Nevegal. Of the race's 18 mass-start stages, only three ended with the majority of the field together at the front of the race.|$|E
5|$|During the project's {{development}} phase, the siting {{and size}} of the Nike-X bases became a major complaint of smaller cities. Originally intended to protect only the largest urban areas, Nike-X was designed to be built at a very large size with many missiles controlled by an expensive computer and radar network. Smaller sites were to be left undefended in the original Nike-X concept since the system was <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> expensive to build with only a few interceptors. These cities complained that they were not only being left open to attack, but that their lack of defenses might make them primary targets. This led to a series of studies on the Small City Defense (SCD) concept. By 1964 SCD had become part of the baseline Nike-X deployment plans, with every major city being provided some level of defensive system.|$|E
5|$|Fears over a {{possible}} French invasion resurfaced {{several times in}} the 19th century, combined with rapid changes in technology, such as the development of steamships and shell guns in the 1840s, rifled cannon and iron-clad warships in the 1850s, and torpedo boats in the 1880s. This spurred fresh investment in those Device Forts still thought to be military valuable, and encouraged the decommissioning of others. By 1900, however, developments in guns and armour had made most of the Device Forts that remained in service <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> small to be practical in modern coastal defence. Despite being brought back into use during the First and Second World Wars, by the 1950s the fortifications were finally considered redundant and decommissioned for good. Coastal erosion over the centuries had taken its toll and some sites had been extensively damaged or completely destroyed. Many were restored, however, and opened to the public as tourist attractions.|$|E

5|$|Other {{approaches}} {{have been suggested}} over time, including cooling the water under a tropical cyclone by towing icebergs into the tropical oceans. Other ideas range from covering the ocean in a substance that inhibits evaporation, dropping large quantities of ice into the eye at very early stages of development (so that the latent heat is absorbed by the ice, instead of being converted to kinetic energy that would feed the positive feedback loop), or blasting the cyclone apart with nuclear weapons. Project Cirrus even involved throwing dry ice on a cyclone. These approaches all suffer from one flaw above many others: tropical cyclones are <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> large and short-lived {{for any of the}} weakening techniques to be practical.|$|E
25|$|Catt {{believed}} that NAWSA's policy of working primarily on state-by-state campaigns was nearing its limits. Some states appeared unlikely ever to approve women's suffrage, {{in some cases}} because state laws made constitutional revision extremely difficult, and in others, especially in the Deep South, because opposition was <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> strong.|$|E

25|$|While the {{purchase}} of all potential free riders may {{solve the problem of}} underproduction due to free riders in smaller markets, it may simultaneously introduce the problem of underproduction due to monopoly. Additionally, some markets are <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> large to make a buyout of all beneficiaries feasible—this is particularly visible with public goods that affect everyone in a country.|$|E
25|$|Edinburgh based {{newspaper}} The Scotsman, {{known for}} its comprehensive coverage of the Edinburgh Festival, originally aimed to review every show on the Fringe. Now they are more selective, as there are <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> many shows to cover, although they do see almost every new play being staged {{as part of the}} Fringe's theatre programme, because of their Fringe First awards.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem with}} the simple quantum well diode {{described}} above is that the thin layer is <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> small to effectively confine the light. To compensate, another two layers are added on, outside the first three. These layers have a lower refractive index than the centre layers, and hence confine the light effectively. Such a design is called a separate confinement heterostructure (SCH) laser diode.|$|E
25|$|Environmental groups make large {{efforts to}} help shape {{legislation}} in New York because they see the strategy as {{an efficient way to}} influence national programs. New York City's economy is larger than Switzerland's, a size that means the city has potential to set new de facto standards.

25|$|It is {{generally}} difficult for any scholar {{to construct a}} portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond {{the basic elements of}} his life. On the other hand, scholars such as N. T. Wright and Luke Timothy Johnson argue that the image of Jesus presented in the gospels is largely accurate, and that dissenting scholars are <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> cautious about what we can claim to know about the ancient era.|$|E

25|$|Using two {{trawlers}} {{to operate}} one trawl net. Both trawlers would sail in line astern formation; the first would fish {{while the second}} would attempt to fend off Icelandic vessels. Unfortunately, this not only {{cut the number of}} vessels engaged in fishing in half: it was also ineffective against Icelandic vessels, as the high standard of seamanship required to steer a heavy, unwieldy trawler in tight formation in rough Atlantic seas was <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> much for a civilian fisherman.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} the torch used in the relay to the Games changes for each Games. They may be {{designed}} to represent a classical ideal, or to represent some local aspect of those particular Games. Some, such as Albertville in 1992 and Turin in 2006 have been designed by famous industrial designers. These design-led torches have been less popular than the more classical designs, the Turin torch in particular was criticised for being <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> heavy for the runners.|$|E
25|$|Hayes was a {{computer}} hobbyist, {{and felt that}} modems would be highly compelling to users of the new 8-bit computers that would soon be known as home computers. However, existing modems were <b>simply</b> <b>too</b> expensive and difficult to use or be practical for most users. What was needed was a single modem that could do it all; connect directly to the phone, answer incoming calls, dial numbers to initiate outgoing calls, and hang up when the call was complete.|$|E
