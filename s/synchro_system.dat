50|$|Single phase {{units have}} five wires: two for an exciter winding (typically line voltage) and three for the output/input. These three are bussed {{to the other}} <b>synchros</b> in the <b>system,</b> and provide the power and {{information}} to align the shafts of all the receivers. Synchro transmitters and receivers must be powered by the same branch circuit, so to speak; the mains excitation voltage sources must match in voltage and phase. The safest approach is to bus the five or six lines from transmitters and receivers at a common point. Different makes of selsyns, used in interlock systems, have different output voltages. In all cases, three-phase systems will handle more power and operate a bit more smoothly. The excitation is often 208/240 V 3-phase mains power. Many synchros operate on 30 to 60 V AC also.|$|R

Ports to the TMS 320 C 80 and the Analog Devices 21060 are foreseen for the near future. GRAPEII also allows for the simulation and debugging of asynchronous as well as synchronous multi-rate applications on a single Unix workstation, on a Unix workstation cluster, on a Meiko Computing Surface and on a Parsytec Xplorer parallel machine.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The AGS Booster must be {{synchronized}} to the AGS rf system before bunch-to-bucket {{transfer of}} the beam. The Booster delivers four batches at 7. 5 Hz and extraction occurs at full acceleration rate, leaving only 5 ms available for synchronization. An improvement {{has been made to}} the synchronization feedback loop. A new loop compensator has been designed using a state variable representation. The three state variables are, beam phase and frequency, and the reference input to the beam control phase loop. The design uses linear quadratic optimum control to achieve greater stability and smaller errors. Lock acquisition, without a transient, is accomplished by a circuit that derives the loop reference from the instantaneous state variable feedback value at loop closing. The reference is brought adiabatically to zero at transfer. II. DESCRIPTION OF THE LOOP The <b>synchro</b> <b>system</b> senses the Booster beam phase, with respect to the AGS rf cavity voltage and cont...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{promising}} new mathematical method for tracking a user's pose (position and orientation) for interactive computer graphics. The method, which is applicable {{to a wide}} variety of both commercial and experimental systems, improves accuracy by properly assimilating sequential observations, filtering sensor measurements, and by concurrently autocalibrating source and sensor devices. It facilitates user motion prediction, multisensor data fusion, and higher report rates with lower latency than previous methods. Tracking systems determine the user's pose by measuring signals from low-level hardware sensors. For reasons of physics and economics, most systems make multiple sequential measurements which are then combined to produce a single tracker report. For example, commercial magnetic trackers using the SPASYN (Space <b>Synchro)</b> <b>system</b> sequentially measure three magnetic vectors and then combine them mathematically to produce a report of the sensor pose. Our new approach produces tracker reports as each new lowlevel sensor measurement is made rather than waiting to form a complete collection of observations. Because single observations under-constrain the mathematical solution, we refer to our approach as single-constraint-at-a-time or SCAAT tracking. The key is that the single observations provide some information about the user's state, and thus can be used to incrementally improve a previous estimate. We recursively apply this principle, incorporating new sensor data as soon as it is measured. With this approach we are able to generate estimates more frequently, with less latency, and with improved accuracy. We present results from both an actual implementation, and from extensive simulations...|$|E
