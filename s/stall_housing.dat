40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} profitability of milk production over several years in a herd of about 100 cows, taking into account changes in the housig system from the tethering to free stall in the “Przyszłość” Farming Cooperative. The study considered costs and income obtained from milk production and assessed profitability of this direction of agricultural activity. The profit being an equivalent of net income was adopted as the final financial result. Among milk productivity indexes the following were calculated: cost of direct production of 1 l milk, total production cost of 1 l milk, profit generated by 1 l milk, profit per 1 cow and per 1 milking cow, the ratio of sale price to production cost of 1 l milk and production profitability index. The above mentioned parameters of milk production efficiency were calculated for the analysed years and for the period of tethering and free <b>stall</b> <b>housing.</b> Level of profitability of milk production in the “Przyszłość” Farming Cooperative was varied, which was conditioned by decreasing production costs and the price of its sales each year. The most advantageous values of milk production profitability index were recorded in 2001 and 2005. With free <b>stall</b> <b>housing</b> system of cows milk production increased increasing the cost of its production at the same time. The main factors causing a reduction of milk production profitability in the free stall system in comparison to the tethering system were connected with significantly higher expenditure on fodder (mainly ready-purchased). The transition from the tethering management system to the free stall system resulted in relatively high values of milk production efficiency indexes at simultaneous reduction of labour consumption and considerable improvement of animal welfare...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{research}} project on feasibility of loose housing systems in The Netherlands, financed by the Dutch Dairy Board (PZ) and Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality (LNV), an international inventory on experiences {{with this kind of}} housing system for dairy cows took place. Data and experiences from Israël, United States of America, Germany, France and Ireland were included and are presented in this report. Sources of information were, scientific journals, applied agricultural papers, conferences, meetings and two trips to Israël and United States. The changes from free <b>stall</b> <b>housing</b> system to in Israel was driven by new regulation on slurry handling and prevention of slurry run off to surface water. The lying area has a surface of dried manure and provides a cow with up to 20 m 2. Twice a day this bedding is tilled to increase evaporation. Due to the arid climate in Israël the bedding becomes dry even when, as is done at some farms, the slurry from the feeding lane is put on the lying area. The changes in the USA were primarily initiated by farmers who wanted better production, well'being and health for their herds. The lying area is smaller (around 7 ' 10 m 2 per cow) and is a combination of sawdust and slurry. This bedding is tilled twice a day during milking and starts composting. The loose housing system in Germany is based on the system in the USA. The loose housing system in Ireland and France is called `out wintering pads¿ and is a alternative for either free <b>stall</b> <b>housing</b> or pasturing during winter. Out wintering pads are a fenced bedding area without roof. The bedding consist of wood chips with drainage underneath and a concrete walking lane behind the feeding rack. Manure is washed into the drainage system. For all different loose housing systems some data are available. The compost barns in the USA are monitored most intensively by the University of Minnesota. General outcomes of monitoring programs and experiences points to an improvement of animal well'being and health without negative effects on milk quality. One aspect that got little attention is the environmental effects i. e. emissions of ammonia, odor and greenhouse gasses. These aspects together with the feasibility under Dutch circumstances is the main focus of the ongoing research in The Netherlands...|$|E

This study used an online survey to test how views on group versus <b>stall</b> <b>housing</b> for pregnant sows varied when Canadian and US par-ticipants were provided information about these systems, including access to scientific papers, YouTube videos, Google images, and a frequently-asked-questions page (S 1 Appendix). Initial responses and changes in responses after accessing the information were analyzed from Likert scores of 242 participants and from their written comments. Par-ticipants were less willing to accept the use of gestation stalls after viewing information on sow housing. For example, initially 30. 4 % of respondents indicated that they supported the use of gestation stalls; this declined to 17. 8 % after participants were provided additional information. Qualitative analysis of comments showed that supporters of gestation stalls expressed concern about the spread of disease and aggression between animals in less confined systems, whereas supporters of group housing placed more emphasis on the sow’s ability to interact socially and perform natural behaviors. These results point to public opposition to the use of gestation stalls, and indicate that the more that the public learns about gestation stalls the less willing they will be to accept their use...|$|E

40|$|The average Upper Midwest dairy {{producer}} milks 50 cows {{in a traditional}} stall barn. Changes in life style expectations, transfer of the farm to the next generation, and inefficient use of labor common in tradition al stall barns has many producers interested in making the move to free stall and parIor systems. However, even the most profitable {{dairy producer}}s (greater than 20, 000 lb/cow/year, 80 to 90 % equity) {{in the region are}} finding it difficult to expand the herd, build a free stall barn, new mil king center, and modem waste handling system all at once.

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} in {{juvenile}} pigs demonstrated {{a relationship between}} the degree of resistance displayed early in life in a so-called "backtest" and parameters of cell-mediated and humoral immunity. Some of the immune characteristics were reported to depend on the interaction between backtest classification and housing system. In the present study, the effects of backtest classification and housing condition on immune reactivity in adult gilts were examined. At 10 and 17 days of age, female piglets were subjected to the backtest. In this test, each piglet is restrained on its back for 1 min and the number of escape attempts is scored. Pigs classified as high resisting (HR) or low resisting (LR) were selected and housed in groups of six gilts. At 7 months of age, half of the gilts were housed in individual stalls. At 12 months of age, gilts were challenged by immunization with DNP-KLH. Control gilts were treated similarly with a placebo. Blood samples were drawn prior to immunization (Day 0) and weekly thereafter until Day 28. No significant effects of backtest type on cellular and Immoral responses against KLH were found. Furthermore, being housed in stalls as compared to groups had no consequences for the immune response and did not induce differences between HR and LR gilts. Differences in behavior and physiology found previously between HR and LR gilts, particularly in gilts in <b>stall</b> <b>housing,</b> may thus be of relatively little importance for immune-related health.

This article describes some of the behavioral differences which contribute to this difference. In particular, lame cows housed in mattress free stall barns appear to spend longer standing in the stall, compared to lame cows in sand stalls. This time spent standing appears to reflect a difficulty in performing the process of lying down and standing up.

Assessment of body condition and backfat measuring were performed at the same day as arteficial insemination. The cows were later divided into two experimental groups, pregnant and non-pregnant. The success rate of conception was 34. 5 %. The results of ultrasound backfat measurements were compatible with the visual assessment of body condition.

Therefore, {{there is a need for}} a relatively cheap and easy measuring method to investigate the potential effect of new emission reduction systems. In 2008 and 2009 Wageningen UR Livestock Research preformed emission measurements on 3 different ammonia emission reduction systems using a dynamic flux chamber. All systems were meant for use in a free <b>stall</b> <b>housing</b> system for dairy cows. Two of the emission reduction systems were concrete floors and one was an emission reduction system covering the slurry in the pits. The experiments were conducted at three different practical dairy farms in the Netherlands, one for each system. Emission of the reduction system was related to emission of a references floor. In all cases a concrete slatted floor with slurry pits was used as a reference. Emission levels ranged from 39 % to 71 % of the emission of the reference system. The two systems based on reduction of floors emissions seemed to have more perspective than the system based on reduction of pit emissions. A complete closing of the pits is however an important condition. Because of the case-control character of the flux chamber measurements the results can not be translated directly to full scale emission factors for dairy housing neither can they be used for between farms comparison...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{attention paid}} {{by both the}} legislature and consumers concerning animal welfare has raised criticism regarding the tie <b>stall</b> <b>housing</b> system of dairy cattle, since it restricts voluntary movement and limits the social behaviour of cows. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the welfare of dairy cows kept in a tie-stall (TS) and an open-stall (OS) system by assessing metabolic, immunological and stress-related parameters. The study involved 155 cows in 18 farms located in Tuscany. Blood samples were collected in the morning in order to measure: aspartate-aminotransferase (AST), alanine-aminotransferase (ALT), betahydroxybutyrate (BHBA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), total proteins (TP), creatinine (Creat), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), phosphorus (P), lysozyme (SL), haptoglobin (Hp), and oxygen free radicals (OFR). At the same time, hair samples were collected to measure cortisol levels and the body condition score was recorded. The results showed that the housing system affected AST, ALT, BHBA, BUN, SL and OFR levels. Most parameters showed values within the range of reference. However, the OFR level was higher in the OS system, probably due to the higher productivity than in TS. Cortisol did not raise particular concern related to chronic stress, since the values were lower than the data reported in literature. The study revealed that the evaluation of welfare based on physiological parameters showed no severe signs of impairment in cows reared in the TS system. ...|$|E

Previous {{investigations}} analysed {{the context}} in which Southern Italian milk husbandry have been developing in the last twenty years and took into consideration the demographic trends both in general and in different breeds. The results highlighted that the total number of Italian Friesian (IF) cattle nearly quadrupled while Italian Brown (IB) cattle (traditionally the dominant breed in the studied area) tripled, in the same period. Like most decisions in farm management, the reasons for this tendency to change animals rely essential upon economic grounds. This work aims to further and deepen our understanding of the phenomenon. To the purpose, an experimental questionnaire investigation was performed. The questionnaire was administered {{to the members of the}} Breeder Associations of Bari and Taranto Provinces which encompass most areas of dairy production. The module questionnaire focussed on collecting data about breeding management including information pertaining to: sex, age and education of the breeder, herd size and cow type, <b>stall</b> <b>housing,</b> artificial inseminations, veterinary assistance in health-related problems, the occurrence of mastitis, incidence of lameness, drug use.

40|$|Monitoring cow {{behaviour}} {{has become}} increasingly important in understanding the nutrition, production, management of the well being, and overall health of dairy cows. Methods of assessing behavioural activity have changed in recent years, favouring automatic recording techniques. Traditional methods to measure behaviour, such as direct observation or time-lapse video, are labour-intensive and time-consuming. Automated recording devices have become increasingly common to measure behaviour accurately. Thus, the development of automated monitoring systems that can continuously and accurately quantify feeding behaviour are required for efficient monitoring and control of modern and automated dairy farms. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the possible use of a 3 D accelerometer to record feeding behaviour of dairy cows. Feeding behaviour (feeding time and number of visits to the manger) of 12 lactating dairy cows was recorded for approximately 3 h with 3 D-accelerometer data loggers (HOBO Pendant G logger). The sensors were positioned in the high part of the neck to monitor head movements. Behaviour was simultaneously recorded using visual observation as a reference. Linear regression analysis between the measurement methods showed that the recorded feeding time (R 2 = 0. 90, n= 12, P< 0. 001) was closely related to visual observations. In contrast, the number of visits was inadequately recorded by the 3 D-accelerometer, showing a poor relationship with visual observations (R 2 = 0. 31, n= 12, P< 0. 06). Results suggest that the use of accelerometer sensors can be a reliable and suitable technology for monitoring feeding behaviour of individual dairy cows in free <b>stall</b> <b>housing.</b> However, further research is necessary to develop an appropriate device able to detect and recognise the movements connected with the head movement during feeding. Such a device could be part of an automatic livestock management tool for the efficient monitoring and control of comfort and welfare of dairy cows under the intensive conditions of modern automated dairy farms...|$|E

40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistant}} (AMR) {{bacteria are}} increasing threats for human and veterinary medicine. Faecal Escherichia coli (E. coli) from preweaned dairy calves is often resistant to multiple antimicrobials and calves may therefore serve as reservoirs for these bacteria and their resistance genes. This thesis investigated the prevalence, risk factors, and spread of resistant E. coli on Swedish dairy farms, with {{special emphasis on}} quinolone resistant E. coli (QREC). Faecal samples from preweaned calves and post-partum cows were analysed for resistant E. coli and set in relation to potential risk factors. The farm environment was sampled to study the occurrence and spread of QREC. The occurrence of faecal resistant E. coli in calves was strongly age-dependent, but was also associated with herd size, milking system, calf housing, and geographic location of the farm. Treatment with some broad-spectrum antimicrobials in cows or calves increased the occurrence of resistant E. coli in calves. Feeding waste milk (WM) from cows treated with antimicrobials during lactation to calves increased the proportion of streptomycin and quinolone resistant E. coli in calves, but feeding waste colostrum from cows treated with antimicrobials at drying off {{had no effect on}} AMR E. coli. Feeding such colostrum or milk to calves was a common practice on Swedish dairy farms, in particular on farms in southern Sweden, on non-organic farms, and on farms with tie <b>stall</b> <b>housing.</b> On farms where QREC is common in faeces of calves, these bacteria were also widespread in the farm environment. In particular, the calf feed andwater trough contained QREC. The same QREC genotype was found throughout the same and on different farms, suggesting contagious spread of QREC within and between farms. Fluoroquinolone treatment, WM feeding, group calving, poor farm hygiene, purchasing cattle or shared animal transports were some risk factors for increasing the occurrence of QREC on the farm. Altogether, the results indicate that proper biosecurity and improved hygiene, less exposure to broad-spectrum antimicrobials, and restrictive waste milk feeding may be important factors to reduce the burden of AMR E. coli on dairy farms...|$|E
40|$|Approximately 88 % of Norwegian {{dairy cattle}} {{are housed in}} tie stalls. Free <b>stall</b> <b>housing</b> for all dairy cattle will be {{implemented}} within 20 years. This means {{that the majority of}} existing stalls will be rebuilt in the near future. Fifty-seven free stall herds of the Norwegian Red breed were randomly selected and 1547 cows and 403 heifers were trimmed by 13 claw trimmers during the late winter and spring of 2002. The claw trimmers had been taught diagnosing and recording of claw lesions. Environment, management- and feeding routines were also recorded. Fifty-three herds had concrete slatted alleys while 4 had solid concrete. Thirty-five herds had concrete as a stall base, while 17 had rubber mats, 2 had wood and 3 had deep litter straw beds. The prevalence of lameness was 1. 6 % in hind claws. Models for lameness and claw lesions were designed to estimate the influence of different risk factors and to account for the cluster effects within herd and claw trimmer. Detected risk factors for lameness were: parity three and above and narrow cubicles; for heel horn erosions: lactation stage around 5 – 7 months after calving and solid concrete alleys; for haemorrhages of the white line: lactation stage around 3 – 5 months after calving and solid concrete alleys; for haemorrhages of the sole: parity one, lactation stage around 5 – 7 months after calving and short cubicles, for white line fissures: slatted concrete alleys; for asymmetrical claws: parities two and above and for corkscrewed claws: solid concrete alleys. The prevalence of lameness in heifers was low, however 29 % had one or more claw lesions. Heifers that were housed in pens or free stalls had more heel-horn erosions, haemorrhages of the sole and white-line fissures than heifers in tie stalls. As new free stalls are being built, it is important to optimise the conditions for claw health. </p...|$|E
