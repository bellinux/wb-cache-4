5|$|Prior to the United States' Civil War, Catholicism grew {{slowly in}} America, but afterward, {{it became more}} {{widespread}} as Catholic immigrants from eastern Europe moved to the four counties, which include Armstrong, Fayette, Indiana, and Westmoreland, to mine coal and produce coke to fire <b>steel</b> <b>mills</b> in Pittsburgh. This influx of Catholic immigrants resulted {{in the creation of}} more than 80 parishes and missions in the counties between 1865 and 1917.|$|E
5|$|By 1922, the eight-hour day {{had become}} common in American industry. One {{exception}} was in <b>steel</b> <b>mills,</b> where workers labored through a twelve-hour workday, {{seven days a}} week. Hoover considered this practice barbaric, and got Harding to convene a conference of steel manufacturers {{with a view to}} ending it. The conference established a committee under the leadership of U. S. Steel chairman Elbert Gary, which in early 1923 recommended against ending the practice. Harding sent a letter to Gary deploring the result, which was printed in the press, and public outcry caused the manufacturers to reverse themselves and standardize the eight-hour day.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, the steel {{industry}} in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S. Following the 1981–1982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers. The <b>steel</b> <b>mills</b> began to shut down. These closures caused a ripple effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed. The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs. Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw white flight to the suburbs.|$|E

5|$|For a long time, it {{was normal}} {{procedure}} for a decommissioned blast furnace to be demolished and either {{be replaced with}} a newer, improved one, or to have the entire site demolished {{to make room for}} follow-up use of the area. In recent decades, several countries have realized the value of blast furnaces as a part of their industrial history. Rather than being demolished, abandoned <b>steel</b> <b>mills</b> were turned into museums or integrated into multi-purpose parks. The largest number of preserved historic blast furnaces exists in Germany; other such sites exist in Spain, France, the Czech Republic, Japan, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Mexico, Russia and the United States.|$|E
5|$|New {{industry}} {{came from}} iron ore, {{discovered in the}} north, mined relatively easily from open pits, and shipped to Great Lakes <b>steel</b> <b>mills</b> from the ports at Duluth and Two Harbors. Economic development and social changes led to an expanded role for state government and a population shift from rural areas to cities. The Great Depression brought layoffs in mining and tension in labor relations but New Deal programs helped the state. After World War II, Minnesota became known for technology, fueled by early computer companies Sperry Rand, Control Data and Cray. The Twin Cities also became a regional center for the arts with cultural {{institutions such as the}} Guthrie Theater, Minnesota Orchestra, and the Walker Art Center.|$|E
5|$|The last {{relic of}} the Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company, the Fairfield Plant, {{continues}} to be operated by U. S. Steel {{as one of its}} five integrated <b>steel</b> <b>mills</b> in the USA. It is the largest steel-making plant in Alabama, employing 2,000 workers as of September 2006, down from a peak of 45,000 during World War II. With a single blast furnace and three basic oxygen process furnaces, amongst other various mills and production facilities, the plant produces 2.4 million tons of raw steel per annum and 640,000 tons of seamless tubular and sheet products, mainly for purchase by the booming oil industry.|$|E
50|$|In August {{the band}} added Robbin Thompson as lead vocalist. Thompson {{had been the}} lead singer with Mercy Flight, a Richmond-based band that had {{regularly}} opened for <b>Steel</b> <b>Mill.</b> He made his debut with <b>Steel</b> <b>Mill</b> on August 29 at the 3rd Annual Nashville Music Festival, sponsored by WMAC. <b>Steel</b> <b>Mill</b> was one of about twenty different acts to take part. Headliners included Roy Orbison, Brian Hyland, Ronnie Milsap, Bobby Bloom, Ballin' Jack, Ten Wheel Drive and The Illusion. <b>Steel</b> <b>Mill</b> {{was one of only}} a handful of acts on the bill without a record contract - some college students with connections on the festival’s organizing committee had seen <b>Steel</b> <b>Mill</b> perform previously in Richmond and helped the band gain a slot on the bill.|$|R

50|$|For 20 years, Ignatiev {{worked in}} a Chicago <b>steel</b> <b>mill</b> in the {{manufacturing}} of farming equipment and electrical components. A Marxist activist, {{he was involved in}} strikes by the mostly-African-American laborers of the <b>steel</b> <b>mill.</b> In 1984, he was laid off from the <b>steel</b> <b>mill,</b> approximately a year after an arrest on charges of attacking a strike-breaker's car with a paint bomb.|$|R
5|$|Before {{the passing}} of the 1963 Act, the only {{exceptions}} to the normal statute of limitations (three years after the events that caused the injury, as established by the Law Reform (Limitation of Actions, etc.) Act 1954) were if the claim was being brought for a case of mistake or fraud, in which case the statute of limitations was twelve months from when the claimant could reasonably have been expected to discover the fraud or mistake. In Cartledge v E. Jopling & Sons Ltd the claimant sued Jopling after he developed pneumoconiosis from working in the company's poorly ventilated <b>steel</b> <b>mills.</b> The injuries were sustained in October 1950 but they were not discovered until 1956, and as a result the injured party had no cause of action. Because the injuries had not been discovered until six years after they were caused, and the statute of limitations was three years after the injury itself, Cartledge was not legally allowed to bring a case.|$|E
5|$|By early 1934, {{the focus}} {{shifted away from}} funding work {{creation}} schemes and toward rearmament. By 1935, military expenditures accounted for 73 percent of the government's purchases of goods and services. On 18 October 1936, Hitler named Göring as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan, intended {{to speed up the}} rearmament programme. In addition to calling for the rapid construction of <b>steel</b> <b>mills,</b> synthetic rubber plants and other factories, Göring instituted wage and price controls and restricted the issuance of stock dividends. Large expenditures were made on rearmament in spite of growing deficits. With the introduction of compulsory military service in 1935, the Reichswehr, which had been limited to 100,000 by the terms of the Versailles Treaty, expanded to 750,000 on active service at the start of World War II, with a million more in the reserve. By January 1939, unemployment was down to 301,800 and it dropped to only 77,500 by September.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to a labor/management impasse arising from bitter disagreements over wage and price controls, Truman instructed his Secretary of Commerce, Charles W. Sawyer, {{to take control of}} a number of the nation's <b>steel</b> <b>mills</b> in April 1952. Truman cited his authority as Commander in Chief and the need to maintain an uninterrupted supply of steel for munitions for the war in Korea. The Supreme Court found Truman's actions unconstitutional, however, and reversed the order in a major separation-of-powers decision, Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952). The 6–3 decision, which held that Truman's assertion of authority was too vague and was not rooted in any legislative action by Congress, was delivered by a Court composed entirely of Justices appointed by either Truman or Roosevelt. The high court's reversal of Truman's order was one of the notable defeats of his presidency.|$|E
50|$|On November 11, 1969, Mercy Flight {{opened for}} <b>Steel</b> <b>Mill</b> when {{they played a}} concert at VCU. Throughout early 1970 Mercy Flight {{continued}} to open regularly for <b>Steel</b> <b>Mill</b> and when Bruce Springsteen decided to add another vocalist he recruited Thompson. He made his debut with <b>Steel</b> <b>Mill</b> on August 29, 1970 at the 3rd Annual Nashville Music Festival, sponsored by WMAC.|$|R
50|$|The pilots of the {{aircraft}} reported control problems shortly before landing. Witnesses said that {{the aircraft}} struck power lines at low altitude at 09:59 local time, and went down on a wasteland where materials used in a <b>steel</b> <b>mill</b> were stored. The <b>steel</b> <b>mill</b> was evacuated following the accident. Dozens of workers from the <b>steel</b> <b>mill</b> and firefighters pulled the survivors from the burning wreckage.|$|R
50|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>Mill</b> was {{an early}} Bruce Springsteen band. Other members of the band {{included}} three future members of the E Street Band - Vini Lopez, Danny Federici and Steve Van Zandt. As well as playing on the Jersey Shore, <b>Steel</b> <b>Mill</b> also played regularly in Richmond, Virginia and played gigs in California and a festival in Nashville, Tennessee. They opened for acts such as Chicago, Boz Scaggs, Grand Funk Railroad, Roy Orbison, Ike & Tina Turner and Black Sabbath. Since 2004 Vini Lopez has led <b>Steel</b> <b>Mill</b> Retro which has performed and recorded original Springsteen songs from the <b>Steel</b> <b>Mill</b> era.|$|R
5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{many of the}} city's slums were demolished, and {{replaced}} with housing schemes such as the Park Hill flats. Large {{parts of the city}} centre were also cleared {{to make way for a}} new system of roads. Increased automation and competition from abroad resulted in the closure of many <b>steel</b> <b>mills.</b> The 1980s saw the worst of this run-down of Sheffield's industries, along with those of many other areas of the UK. The building of the Meadowhall Centre on the site of a former steelworks in 1990 was a mixed blessing, creating much needed jobs but hastening the decline of the city centre. Attempts to regenerate the city were kick-started when the city hosted the 1991 World Student Games, which saw the construction of new sporting facilities such as the Sheffield Arena, Don Valley Stadium and the Ponds Forge complex.|$|E
5|$|Youngstown's {{industrial}} development {{changed the face}} of the Mahoning Valley. The community's burgeoning coal industry drew hundreds of immigrants from Wales, Germany, and Ireland. With the establishment of <b>steel</b> <b>mills</b> in the late 19th century, Youngstown became a popular destination for immigrants from Eastern Europe, Italy, and Greece. In the early 20th century, the community saw an influx of immigrants from non-European countries including what is modern day Lebanon, Palestine/Israel, and Syria. By the 1920s, this dramatic demographic shift produced a nativist backlash, and the Mahoning Valley became a center of Ku Klux Klan activity. The situation reached a climax in 1924, when street clashes between Klan members and Italian and Irish Americans in neighboring Niles led Ohio Governor A. Victor Donahey to declare martial law. By 1928 the Klan was in steep decline; and three years later, the organization sold its Canfield, Ohio, meeting area, Kountry Klub Field.|$|E
5|$|Before World War II, the {{international}} shipping demand for bulk products was low—about 25million tons for metal ores—and {{most of this}} trade was coastal. However, on the Great Lakes, bulkers hauled vast amounts of ore from the northern mines to the <b>steel</b> <b>mills.</b> In 1929, 73 million tons of iron ore was transported on the Lakes, and an almost equal amount of coal, limestone, and other products were also moved. Two defining characteristics of bulkers were already emerging: the double bottom, which was adopted in 1890, and the triangular structure of the ballast tanks, which was introduced in 1905. After World War II, an international bulk trade began to develop among industrialized nations, particularly between the European countries, the United States and Japan. Due to the economics of this trade, ocean bulkers became larger and more specialized. In this period, Great Lakes freighters increased in size, to maximize economies of scale, and self-unloaders became more common to cut turnaround time. The thousand-footers of the Great Lakes fleets, built in the 1970s, were among the longest ships afloat and in 1979, a record 214 million ton of bulk cargo were moved on the Great Lakes.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries the world's largest <b>steel</b> <b>mill</b> was the Barrow Hematite Steel Company {{steelworks}} located in Barrow-in-Furness, United Kingdom. Today, the world's largest <b>steel</b> <b>mill</b> is in Gwangyang, South Korea.|$|R
50|$|On December 1, 1967, {{the provincial}} {{government}} established Sydney Steel Corporation (SYSCO) under an act of the provincial legislature. to operate DOSCO's <b>steel</b> <b>mill</b> {{for a period of}} 12 months until the <b>steel</b> <b>mill</b> could be resold to another private operator.|$|R
5|$|TCI was {{not fully}} {{incorporated}} into U. S. Steel, {{and continued to}} operate as an extremely profitable subsidiary of its parent company well into the 20th century. Immediately following the merger, a venture was launched to create a new, larger TCI plant {{to the west of}} Ensley and {{at the center of a}} new company town, and so in 1910 work on the planned community of Corey, Alabama, began. Named after an executive who later committed suicide, Corey was soon renamed Fairfield, and the steel works there opened in 1917. With the discovery of new coking coal and ore deposits in the region, and with the aid of U. S. Steel's enormous capital, the Fairfield works were quickly expanded with the construction of new <b>steel</b> <b>mills</b> and rail links. Several rolling mills were completed in 1917, which produced ship materials for the nearby shipbuilding plants in Chickasaw, Alabama, in support of America's sudden entry into World War I. In 1920 a direct rail line between Fairfield and Birmingport, the new port of Birmingham on the Warrior River was opened. This was followed by the completion of the 'High Ore Line Railroad', which connected the Red Mountain and the Fairfield works; trains literally rolled down the hill from mine to mill. In 1923 a merchant steel mill was completed, followed by the opening of a sheet products mill in 1926.|$|E

25|$|On June 2, 1952, in a 6-3 ruling, the Supreme Court {{declared}} in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer {{that the president}} lacked the authority to seize the <b>steel</b> <b>mills.</b> Writing for a heavily divided majority, Justice Hugo Black held {{that the president had}} no authority under the Constitution to seize private property on the grounds of national security. Since the Congress had not otherwise authorized the president to seize the <b>steel</b> <b>mills,</b> the president could not do so.|$|E
50|$|The {{resulting}} run off {{of contaminants}} from the coke production, {{as well as}} general contaminants from the <b>steel</b> <b>mill</b> itself, drained into Muggah Creek, a tidal estuary that geographically separated the <b>steel</b> <b>mill</b> and Whitney Pier from Sydney's central business district.|$|R
25|$|The Pennsylvania Steel Company {{founded a}} <b>steel</b> <b>mill</b> at Sparrow's Point in Baltimore in 1887. The mill was {{purchased}} by Bethlehem Steel in 1916, and it became the world's largest <b>steel</b> <b>mill</b> by the mid-20th century, employing {{tens of thousands of}} workers.|$|R
50|$|The <b>steel</b> <b>mill</b> was {{responsible}} for the neighbourhood's economic growth during the 20th century but it is also responsible for its economic decline as well. From the <b>steel</b> <b>mill's</b> inception in 1901 until the mid-1980s, the mill was fueled with coke, a byproduct of cooking raw coal over a multiple hour period. To do this, coal was shipped by the Sydney & Louisburg Railway (and later the Devco Railway) from the mines to a large battery of coke ovens bordering the railway lines {{on the south side of}} the neighbourhood along Frederick Street on a hill overlooking the <b>steel</b> <b>mill.</b> The coke ovens produced coke for the <b>steel</b> <b>mill's</b> oxygen blast furnaces 24 hours a day, 365 days a year for almost 90 years.|$|R
