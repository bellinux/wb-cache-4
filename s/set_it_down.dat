The path was frequently decorated with sphinx statues and punctuated by barque stations, where the priests carrying the festival barque could <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> to rest during the procession. The processional path usually ended in a quay on the Nile, which served as the entrance point for river-borne visitors and the exit point for the festival procession when it travelled by water. In Old Kingdom pyramid temples, the quay adjoined an entire temple (the valley temple), which {{was linked to the}} pyramid temple by the processional causeway.|$|E
25|$|Biomechatronics mimics how {{the human}} body works. For example, four {{different}} steps must occur {{to be able to}} lift the foot to walk. First, impulses from the motor center of the brain are sent to the foot and leg muscles. Next the nerve cells in the feet send information, providing feedback to the brain, enabling it to adjust the muscle groups or amount of force required to walk across the ground. Different amounts of force are applied {{depending on the type of}} surface being walked across. The leg's muscle spindle nerve cells then sense and send the position of the floor back up to the brain. Finally, when the foot is raised to step, signals are sent to muscles in the leg and foot to <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The scene then {{changes to}} reveal Lady Anne {{accompanying}} {{the corpse of}} the late king Henry VI, along with Trestle and Berkeley, {{on its way to}} be interred at St Paul's cathedral. [...] She asks them to set down the [...] "honourable load – if honour may be shrouded in a hearse," [...] and then laments the fate of the house of Lancaster. [...] Richard suddenly appears and demands that the [...] "unmannerd dog" [...] carrying the hearse <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> at which point a brief verbal wrangling takes place.|$|E

60|$|Douglas {{returned}} his greeting cordially. His vis-a-vis drew the menu towards him and studied <b>it</b> with interest. <b>Setting</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> he screwed a single eyeglass into {{his eye and}} beamed over at Douglas.|$|R

2500|$|An {{important}} game mechanic is {{the construction}} of a road network so as to allow for an efficient transportation system, as any settlers transporting goods must use roads. To build a road, the player must place a flag, select the [...] "build road" [...] option, and then place another flag. The computer will then automatically find the shortest route between the two and build the road, although the player is also free to build the road manually. To maximize distribution, the player must set as many flags as possible on each road. Flags can only be set a certain distance apart, and serve as transport hubs; a settler will carry an item to a flag and <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>down,</b> at which point the next settler along will pick up the item and continue, freeing the first settler to return and pick up another item at the previous flag. The more flags the player has, the more settlers will operate on a given road, cutting down the distance each settler must travel, and reducing the time to transport one item and return for the next, thus avoiding item congestion at each flag. When more than one item is placed at a flag, the game has an adjustable goods priority system, which determines the order in which items are transported. Players can also build shipyards, which allow for the manufacture of boats (can transport goods over small stretches of water), and ships (can transport goods across oceans).|$|E

60|$|From {{all these}} things Foster judged that {{this was one of}} the women's apartments, and {{wondered}} much that he had been admitted into such a jealously-guarded sanctuary, but relieved his mind by <b>setting</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> to that eccentricity for which Ben-Ahmed was noted.|$|R
60|$|There he stopped; {{and raising}} the bowl of punch to his lips, drank a long deep draught, {{as if it were}} fair water and cooling to his parched mouth. <b>Setting</b> <b>it</b> <b>down</b> abruptly, and {{resuming}} his preparations, he went on with his soliloquy.|$|R

60|$|Galliard {{noted the}} change in amazement, yet, knowing to what follies youth is driven when it woos, he {{accounted}} Cynthia responsible for it, and laughed in his sardonic way, whereat the boy would blush and scowl in one.
