2500|$|One {{reason that}} {{psychedelic}} therapy was eventually restricted was {{concern about the}} use of drugs by the general public. In the mid-1960s, in response to concerns regarding the proliferation of the unauthorized use of psychedelic drugs by the general public (especially the counterculture), various steps were taken to curtail their use. Bowing to governmental concerns, Sandoz halted production of LSD in 1965, and in many countries LSD was banned, or made available on a very limited basis that made research difficult. Gradually, increasing restrictions were placed on medical and psychiatric research conducted with LSD and other psychedelic substances. In a congressional hearing in 1966, Senator Robert Kennedy questioned the shift of opinion with regards to this potentially rewarding form of treatment, noting that, [...] "Perhaps to some extent we have lost <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> (LSD) can be very, very helpful in our society if used properly." ...|$|E

60|$|Such {{a mental}} state cannot endure {{for more than}} a few moments, and passing away, it left me weary and despondent. With dull, joyless eyes I {{continued}} gazing for upwards of an hour on the prospect beneath me; for I had now given up all hopes of seeing Yoletta, not yet having encountered a single person since starting for my ride. All about me the summit was dotted with small lilies of a delicate blue, but at a little distance <b>the</b> sober green <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grass became absorbed, as it were, in the brighter flower-tints, and the neighboring summits all appeared of a pure cerulean hue. Lower down this passed into <b>the</b> purples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slopes and <b>the</b> reds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plains, while the valleys, fringed with scarlet, were like rivers of crocus-colored fire. Distance, and the light, autumnal haze, had a subduing and harmonizing effect on <b>the</b> sea <b>of</b> brilliant color, and further away on the immense horizon it all faded into the soft universal blue. Over this flowery paradise my eyes wandered restlessly, for my heart was restless in me, and had lost <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> pleasure. With a slight bitterness I recalled some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> words the father had spoken to me that morning. It was all very well, I thought, for this venerable graybeard to talk about refreshing the soul with <b>the</b> <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> all this beauty; but he seemed to lose <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> important <b>fact</b> that there was a considerable difference in our respective ages, that <b>the</b> raging hunger <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart, which he had doubtless experienced at one time of his life, was, like bodily hunger, not to be appeased with splendid sunsets, rainbows and rainbow lilies, however beautiful they might seem to the eye.|$|R
60|$|But, {{although}} this general statement is complete and indisputable, {{yet to see}} its applications under all the complex conditions that actually occur in nature, it is necessary always {{to bear in mind}} the tremendous power and universality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agencies at work. We must never for an instant lose <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enormously rapid increase of all organisms, which has been illustrated by actual cases, given in our second chapter, no less than by calculations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> unchecked increase for a few years. Then, never forgetting that the animal and plant population of any country is, on the whole, stationary, we must be always trying to realise <b>the</b> ever-recurring destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enormous annual increase, and asking ourselves what determines, in each individual case, <b>the</b> death <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many, <b>the</b> survival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> few. We must think over all <b>the</b> causes <b>of</b> destruction to each organism,--to the seed, the young shoot, the growing plant, the full-grown tree, or shrub, or herb, and again the fruit and seed; and among animals, to the egg or new-born young, to the youthful, and to the adults. Then, we must always bear in mind that what goes on in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual or family group we may observe or think of, goes on also among the millions and scores of millions of individuals which are comprised in almost every species; and must get rid <b>of</b> <b>the</b> idea that chance determines which shall live and which die. For, although in many individual cases death may be due to chance rather than to any inferiority in those which die first, yet we cannot possibly believe that this can be the case on the large scale on which nature works. A plant, for instance, cannot be increased unless there are suitable vacant places its seeds can grow in, or stations where it can overcome other less vigorous and healthy plants. <b>The</b> seeds <b>of</b> all plants, by their varied modes of dispersal, may be said to be seeking out such places in which to grow; and we cannot doubt that, in the long run, those individuals whose seeds are the most numerous, have <b>the</b> greatest powers <b>of</b> dispersal, and <b>the</b> greatest vigour <b>of</b> growth, will leave more descendants than <b>the</b> individuals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same species which are inferior in all these respects, although now and then some seed of an inferior individual may chance to be carried to a spot where it can grow and survive. The same rule will apply to every period of life and to every danger to which plants or animals are exposed. The best organised, or the most healthy, or the most active, or the best protected, or the most intelligent, will inevitably, in the long run, gain an advantage over those which are inferior in these qualities; that is, the fittest will survive, the fittest being, in each particular case, those which are superior in the special qualities on which safety depends. At one period of life, or to escape one kind of danger, concealment may be necessary; at another time, to escape another danger, swiftness; at another, intelligence or cunning; at another, the power to endure rain or cold or hunger; and those which possess all these faculties in the fullest perfection will generally survive.|$|R
