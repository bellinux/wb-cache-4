5|$|Natural {{selection}} can act {{at different}} levels of organisation, such as genes, cells, individual organisms, groups of organisms and <b>species.</b> <b>Selection</b> can act at multiple levels simultaneously. An example of selection occurring below the level of the individual organism are genes called transposons, which can replicate and spread throughout a genome. Selection at a level above the individual, such as group selection, may allow the evolution of cooperation, as discussed below.|$|E
5|$|These {{outcomes}} of evolution are distinguished based on time scale as macroevolution versus microevolution. Macroevolution refers to evolution that occurs {{at or above}} the level of species, in particular speciation and extinction; whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population, in particular shifts in gene frequency and adaptation. In general, macroevolution is regarded as the outcome of long periods of microevolution. Thus, the distinction between micro- and macroevolution is not a fundamental one—the difference is simply the time involved. However, in macroevolution, the traits of the entire species may be important. For instance, a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new habitats, lessening the chance of it going extinct, while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation, by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated. In this sense, microevolution and macroevolution might involve selection at different levels—with microevolution acting on genes and organisms, versus macroevolutionary processes such as <b>species</b> <b>selection</b> acting on entire species and affecting their rates of speciation and extinction.|$|E

25|$|Ecotype, ecotope, or biotope aquaria {{is another}} type based on <b>species</b> <b>selection.</b> In it, an aquarist {{attempts}} to simulate a specific natural ecosystem, assembling fish, invertebrate species, plants, decorations and water conditions all found in that ecosystem. These biotope aquaria {{are the most}} sophisticated hobby aquaria; public aquaria use this approach whenever possible. This approach best simulates the experience of observing in the wild. It typically serves as the healthiest possible artificial environment for the tank's occupants.|$|E
25|$|Aquaria may {{be grouped}} by their <b>species</b> <b>selection.</b> The {{community}} tank {{is the most common}} today, where several non-aggressive species live peacefully. In these aquaria, the fish, invertebrates, and plants probably do not originate from the same geographic region, but tolerate similar water conditions. Aggressive tanks, in contrast, house a limited number of species that can be aggressive toward other fish, or are able to withstand aggression well. Most marine tanks and tanks housing cichlids have to take the aggressiveness of the desired species into account when stocking. Specimen tanks usually only house one fish species, along with plants, perhaps ones found in the fishes' natural environment and decorations simulating a natural ecosystem. This type is useful for fish that cannot coexist with other fish, such as the electric eel, as an extreme example. Some tanks of this sort are used simply to house adults for breeding.|$|E

500|$|The role of {{extinction}} in evolution {{is not very}} well understood and may depend on which type {{of extinction}} is considered. The causes of the continuous [...] "low-level" [...] extinction events, which form the majority of extinctions, {{may be the result}} of competition between species for limited resources (the competitive exclusion principle). If one species can out-compete another, this could produce <b>species</b> <b>selection,</b> with the fitter species surviving and the other species being driven to extinction. The intermittent mass extinctions are also important, but instead of acting as a selective force, they drastically reduce diversity in a nonspecific manner and promote bursts of rapid evolution and speciation in survivors.|$|E
2500|$|For {{evolution}} to {{be driven}} by <b>species</b> <b>selection,</b> differential success must be the result of selection upon species-intrinsic properties, rather than for properties of genes, cells, individuals, or populations within species. Such properties include, for example, population structure, their propensity to speciate, extinction rates, and geological persistence. [...] While the fossil record shows differential persistence of species, examples of species-intrinsic properties subject to natural selection have been much harder to document.|$|E

2500|$|It remains {{controversial}} among biologists whether selection {{can operate}} at {{and above the}} level of species. [...] One particular defender {{of the idea of}} <b>species</b> <b>selection</b> was Stephen Jay Gould who proposed the view that there exist macroevolutionary processes which shape evolution that are not driven by the microevolutionary mechanisms that are the basis of the Modern Synthesis. If one views species as entities that replicate (speciate) and die (go extinct), then species could be subject to selection and thus could change their occurrence over geological time, much as heritable selected-for traits change theirs over generations.|$|E
