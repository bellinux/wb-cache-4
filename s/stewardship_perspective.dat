The coffee industry in {{a developing country}} is examined highlighting how diverse contextual pressures may affect a family in business. This qualitative study focuses in Guatemala, Central America, with a single case study. Findings reveal that contextual crisis can ignite a differentiation approach which align with an entrepreneurial <b>stewardship</b> <b>perspective.</b> Such approach emphasizes a shared vision {{to look after the}} family coffee farm, the application of traditional and specialised knowledge to bring out the best features of a product and the development of diverse relationships to serve the business over time...|$|E

We also suggest that the relationship between psychological ownership and entrepreneurial orientation is mediated by knowledge sharing. Finally, we assess the potential moderating roles of heterogenous governance conditions in terms of the generation in control, generational involvement and family involvement in the top management team with regard to the relationship between psychological ownership and knowledge sharing.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{transaction}} cost economics {{theory of the}} family firm, building upon the concepts of family-based asset specificity, bounded rationality, and bounded reliability. We argue that the prosperity and survival of family firms depend on {{the absence of a}} dysfunctional bifurcation bias. The bifurcation bias is an expression of bounded reliability, reflected in the de facto asymmetric treatment of family vs. nonfamily assets (especially human assets). We propose that absence of bifurcation bias is critical to fostering reliability in family business functioning. Our study ends the unproductive divide between the agency and <b>stewardship</b> <b>perspectives</b> of the family firm, which offer conflicting accounts of this firm type's functioning. We show that the predictions of the agency and <b>stewardship</b> <b>perspectives</b> can be usefully reconciled when focusing on how family firms address the bifurcation bias or fail to do so...|$|R

While the principal can only use contractible performance measures in the contract with the agent, capital market participants can only use disclosed information when pricing firm value. We find that the disclosure of information can decrease the principal’s expected net profit. This result follows from either a noisier or a less congruent market price {{as a consequence of}} disclosing additional information. Thus, we present a rationale for partial disclosure in the absence of proprietary costs or the uncertainty of information endowment...|$|E

40|$|In {{light of}} {{the large number of}} listed family firms that operate in and {{contribute}} to the Italian economy, this paper tries to provide evidence and indications on their role in comparison with their non-family counterparts. The analysis adopts two perspectives. From the agency perspective, some recent literature on the links between investor protection and governance profiles argues that family members are more willing than other shareholders to divert private benefits in countries, like Italy, with a poor legal framework: the question is empirically puzzling. From the <b>stewardship</b> <b>perspective,</b> the degree of familiness affects the stewardship attitude of the firm: we do not find that family firms perform worse or better than non-family ones. Some evidence is found in relation to the entrenchment effect: in family firms with members as CEOs, the performance seems to be significantly lower. The stewardship attitude, and not familiness per se, does matter: moderate levels of stewardship improve performance and facilitate risk-taking, while extreme levels (i. e., on the one hand, widely held ownership in non-family firms, or ownership fragmentation among descendants in family firms; on the other hand, close ownership/boards or family members as CEOs) worsen performance...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the impact of CEO duality on firm performance; which attracted much attention, especially in emerging economies, yet yielded several inconsistent empirical results.

40|$|AbstractRecreational users {{appreciate}} the UK marine environment for its cultural ecosystem services (CES) {{and their use}} and non-use values. UK Governments are currently establishing a network of marine protected areas (MPAs) informed by ecological data and socio-economic evidence. Evidence on CES values is needed, but only limited data have been available. We present a case study from the UK National Ecosystem Assessment (NEA) follow-on phase that elicited divers’ and anglers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for potential MPAs. The case study is an innovative combination of a travel-cost based choice experiment and an attribute-based contingent valuation method. Our study design allowed us to understand the marine users’ preferences from both a user and a <b>stewardship</b> <b>perspective.</b> Following the UK NEA’s place-based CES framework, we characterised marine CES as environmental spaces that might be protected, with features including the underwater seascape, and iconic and non-iconic species. Our survey highlighted the importance of CES to divers and anglers. A wide variety of marine spaces influenced user-WTP, while stewardship-WTP was most influenced by management restrictions, species protection, and attitudes towards marine conservation. An understanding of key stakeholders’ CES values can inform a more holistic and sustainable approach to marine management, especially for decisions involving trade-offs between marine protection and opportunity costs of the blue economy...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{increase}} understanding of the internationalization of family firms; to investigate how the framework by Bell et al. on the internationalization patterns of firms could explain the internationalization pathways taken by family-owned small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); and to identify typical patterns and features in the various pathways taken by family-owned SMEs. Design/methodology/approach: This paper reports findings from an in-depth multiple case study with eight Finnish family-owned SMEs. Findings: The ownership structure had the most important role in defining the internationalization pathways followed by the family-owned SMEs: a fragmented ownership structure led to traditional internationalization pathway whereas a concentrated ownership base led to born global or born-again global pathways. Practical implications: Family entrepreneurs should carefully consider the division of ownership and seek to build new relationships in foreign markets, in addition to their primary co-operators. Originality/value: The authors extend the integrative model of small firm internationalization by Bell et al. toward family-owned SMEs and highlight the most important dimensions in the different internationalization pathways of family SMEs. The ownership dimension is integrated within discussion on differing internationalization pathways. The authors utilize a family business specific perspective (the <b>stewardship</b> <b>perspective),</b> in order to understand the specific features of internationalization among family SMEs, and also how these features differ between family SMEs and other firms...|$|E
40|$|Two major {{perspectives}} can {{be construed}} {{in the literature}} concerning the nature of family owned businesses (FOBs). The first implies that these enterprises have unique characteristics of stewardship. FOB owners are said to care deeply about the long-term prospects of the business, {{in large part because}} their family's fortune, reputation and future are at stake. Their stewardship is said to be manifested by unusual devotion to the "continuity" of the company, by more assiduous nurturing of a "community" of employees, and by seeking out closer "connections" with customers to sustain the business. The second perspective is less flattering. It proposes that FOBs are unusually subject to stagnation: they are said to face unique resource restrictions, embrace conservative strategies, eschew growth, and be doomed to short lives. This paper develops and examines the merits of the two perspectives, neither of which has been systematically articulated or researched. It does so in an empirical study of only small firms that are owned and managed by their founder. Within this sample, it compares firms that are FOBs, that is, family owned and managed, with non-FOBs, that is, owned and managed by a founder with no other relative involved in the business. The findings show significant support for all three aspects of the <b>stewardship</b> <b>perspective</b> of FOBs, and no support for any elements of the stagnation perspective.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to explain the}} impact of board structure on company performance. This involves establishing the dimensionality of board structure. Two dimensions are found: board independence and network connections. The effect of each dimension of board structure on performance is then investigated. The examination begins with two competing theories: agency and stewardship. Using the agency theory model, it is hypothesised that an independent board will control self-interested behaviour and put incentive alignment mechanisms in place and that these actions will strengthen firm performance. In opposition to agency theory, stewardship}p theory holds that managerial control of the firm empowers and motivates managers to maximise company profits. Therefore, managerial control of the board leads to high company performance. There is a third theoretical framework dominant ln governance research, resource dependence, which is also examined. This theory focuses on the board's role in co-opting external resources for the organization. It is also tested using data on network connections and firm performance. The study uses a sample of 145 publicly listed Australian companies. Data from archival sources was collected for the period 1992 - 1994. The impact of board structure is assessed using a lagged design with performance being measured subsequent to structure. Confidence {{in the direction of}} causality from structure to performance is established with controls for prior performance. Industry, size, risk and leverage are also controlled The main results of the regression analyses suggest that board independence has a negative effect on shareholder wealth and sales growth. Network connections have no effect. These results challenge agency and resource dependence theory and support the newer <b>perspective,</b> <b>stewardship</b> theory. Boards characterised by managerial control are found to have positive effects on shareholder wealth and sales growth. However, in treating the two dimensions of board independence and network connections separately, a new pattern appears. Board independence is moderated by network connections. The effect of board independence is contingent on high connections...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose for}} {{this paper is}} to {{determine}} whether there is any direct connection between board composition and R&D investments of Swedish listed companies. A century ago, Sweden was among the poorest nations in Europe, yet today Sweden is 3 rd among world leaders in innovation. Innovation is approximated as a good proxy measurement for R&D investments. R&D has been the primary source for innovation because of today’s nature of economies in which firms are challenged with competitive advantage. R&D investments have become very essential for every organization as well, yet there is no clear relationship between board composition and R&D investments. The researchers sought to confirm whether the effects of board composition are not only to monitor but also to provide resources since R&D spending requires appropriate forms of control systems and proper level of resources in the form of skill, experience and knowledge. The researchers obtained that the Swedish code of corporate governance is the main form of regulation and control mechanism that are mandatory for the boards of listed companies to adapt and comply with. In this study, the researchers integrated agency theory, resource dependence theory, and stakeholder theory and <b>stewardship</b> theory <b>perspectives</b> to explain the effects of board composition on R&D investments. The hypotheses were derived from these mentioned theories, tested from the sample data of 68 companies extracted from listed firms in Stockholm Stock Market. Board tenure, board interlock, independent directors, and ownership of shares, board size, age diversity and gender diversity were used as the influential factors for R&D investments. Additionally, firm size, ROA, firm age and leverage were adopted as moderating variables to test the effect of board membership composition against R&D spending. However, only board interlock came out to be negative and significantly correlated at 5 % level with R&D investments and the remaining variables were detected to have negative low correlations with R&D investment, though no significant associations were found. Out of the control variables chosen only ROA obtained a significantly negative low correlation at 1 % level. The epistemological and ontological choices for this study were positivism and objectivism with deductive approach. In order to examine if there is a relationship between board composition and R&D investment, the researchers employed multiple regression analysis. The researchers also identified a research gap since they did not find any evidence of a study that examines board composition in relation to R&D investments in Sweden. As indicated by the results of this study, only board interlock has effect on R&D spending. Therefore, there is need for further research on R&D investments by examining other forms of board composition characteristics such as education and professional experience. Both qualitative and quantitative studies are recommendable in this area. The authors concluded that the board characteristics do not directly matter for Swedish corporations to invest annually in R&D activities. This paper provides full support to stakeholders’ theory and stewardship theory while partially agrees with agency theory and resource dependence theory.

40|$|The {{performance}} of State secondary schools in New Zealand is currently {{measured by the}} schools’ performance measurement systems (PMS). The PMS are established by the schools’ boards of trustees in line with guidelines developed primarily by the Ministry of Education (MoE), while incorporating {{the requirements of the}} Education Review Office (ERO) and the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA). The PMS focuses on the {{performance of}} teachers, as well as the principal and the school, but all are assessed from a <b>stewardship</b> oriented <b>perspective,</b> that does not adequately reflect the expectations of a school’s nongovernmental stakeholders. The purpose of this research is to determine the key stakeholders of State secondary schools in New Zealand and identify their key performance factors (KPFs) and associated key performance indicators (KPIs). This research employed a mixed methods approach, guided by the pragmatist paradigm. This study used a sequential research design consisting of a qualitative method (semistructured interviews) followed by a quantitative method (questionnaire). Stakeholder theory provided the theoretical basis for identifying the schools’ stakeholders, and the theory of stakeholder salience gave the rationale for identification of the schools’ key stakeholders. Two performance measurement frameworks, “strategic factors” and the “portfolio approach” informed this research in identifying the KPFs and associated KPIs of the key stakeholders. This research has identified eight key stakeholders of State secondary schools in New Zealand. They include three Crown entities: ERO, MoE, NZQA, “one statutory body” the board of trustees (BOT), and four nongovernmental stakeholder groups: teachers, parents, students, and the community. The schools’ PMS do not adequately reflect the expectations of nongovernmental stakeholders. Thus, this study has chosen to identify the KPFs and associated KPIs of the two most salient nongovernmental stakeholders, i. e., teachers and parents. This research has identified seven KPFs for teachers in addition to a number of KPIs that indicate the status of the KPFs. Four of the seven teachers’ KPFs: 1) workload, 2) safety, 3) support, and 4) resources reflect issues concerning individual teachers. On the basis of these findings, a holistic teachers’ performance management process for schools has been proposed. This process recognises the transactional relationship between management and teachers, required to improve schools’ performances. This study has also identified seven KPFs for parents; the two most salient are “quality teachers” and “communication” as they influence four other parents’ KPFs. The findings of this investigation have implications in two areas: 1) the management of the schools, and 2) the educational policy of the government. School management needs to provide quality teachers, adequate support to teachers and students by improving the “management system” of schools in line with expectations of teachers and parents, while ensuring safety at all times in schools. The government’s education policy should focus on the following: reducing teachers’ nonteaching activities; providing skills to teachers so that they can engage cross-culturally as well as with students from adverse backgrounds, and inducting individuals into the teaching profession who see teaching as a service/dedication to a cause and not merely a means to earn a living. It is expected that a holistic, stakeholder-focused, and transactional relationship between the school and its stakeholders will result in greater engagement between the schools and their stakeholders, leading to beneficial outcomes for both schools and for society at large such as lower truancy, and improved academic achievement...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{this thesis}} I analyze {{the role of}} {{stewardship}} groups in the Grand River watershed. The perceptions of stewardship volunteers and key agency informants are examined to determine the biophysical, educational and social implications of stewardship initiatives in the Grand River basin. The first objective {{is to examine the}} role of environmental stewardship group participants, understanding their contributions to biophysical or social changes in the Grand River basin. The intent is to determine if biophysical and social changes promoted by stewardship groups are influencing the watershed at a localized community level, whether broader, more cumulative effects are being demonstrated within the river basin, or if both effects are evident. The second objective considers the motivations of <b>stewardship</b> volunteers, <b>perspectives</b> regarding involvement with environmental stewardship groups, and contributions to change within the community. Consideration is given to the importance of tangible results for many volunteers, as well as the acknowledgement of the risk for burnout for volunteers involved with environmental groups. The third and final objective considers if the initiatives or changes implemented by stewardship groups are influential in guiding river basin management through policy and decision making. Impact and influence of stewardship groups on decision making are assessed, based on the responses and reports of agency and organizational members, in addition to representatives from municipal and township government offices. A case study approach is used to investigate the rare Charitable Research Reserve, Woolwich Healthy Communities, and Kitchener’s Natural Areas Program in the Grand River basin. Relevant information pertaining to other stewardship group activity is included where appropriate. Data collection methods included surveys distributed to a combined group of 52 stewardship group volunteers and event participants, 14 personal interviews with key informants, and participant observation from June to October 2013. The results indicate that environmental stewardship groups in the Grand River watershed are playing a role in creating biophysical change through the work of on-ground projects such as stream bank restoration initiatives and tree planting projects. Contributions to social change are evident through groups that are committed to community outreach and educational programs, particularly those targeted towards youth and school children. An examination of the motivations for stewardship participation revealed a consistent pattern of three primary reasons. First, there was a desire to contribute to the community or make some environmental enhancement or change. Second, participants expressed a wish to improve ecological or environmental knowledge and awareness. Third, respondents noted a strong sense of volunteering or participating in stewardship as a means to make social connections or meet people with similar interests. The achievement of tangible results for on-ground efforts was observed by both stewardship group participants and organizational members to be important in the avoidance and alleviation of potential volunteer burnout. Concerns from agency and municipal representatives suggest that stewardship groups tend to have a local, community focus with less concern for the ‘big picture’, or the potential for wider-reaching or cumulative effects of various projects. Yet, examples from the case study groups and other groups in the watershed indicate that there is an influence on the biophysical environment and at a social level beyond the immediate local initiative. Partnerships between stewardship groups and other agencies and organizations are highlighted as a strength with regard to the potential for greater impact at a broader scale in the river basin, as well as an opportunity for future growth and development in collaborative environmental and water management strategies. Corporate partnerships and employee volunteer programs are identified by several of the groups and organizations as valuable and promising approaches to collaborate on environmental stewardship initiatives. Several aspects of this research suggest an opportunity for further study, particularly with regard to how evolving partnerships may contribute to the joint success of stewardship groups and governing or management agencies within the Grand River watershed. It would be interesting to determine if the development of stronger partnerships through collaboration between local stewardship groups and governing agencies such as the Grand River Conservation Authority might lead to larger stewardship initiatives and improved outcomes for targeted areas of need in the river basin...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine generational {{succession}} in family business as it relates to four key protagonists: the incumbent, the successor, the family, and non-family influence. Santora and colleagues (2001, 2007, 2011) assert that succession planning in not for profits is growing in importance, but that much more work needs to be done in this area. Accordingly, this study was undertaken in order to address some of these gaps in the research as it applies to family business. Additionally, the research framework for the study was stewardship theory, which states that “[this] theory appears to be a suitable perspective in viewing the family as a resource because it depicts organizational members as collectivists, pro-organizational and trustworthy... when family members are stewards of their organizations, they are motivated to fulfill organizational goals and to maximize firm performance. Family firms are often depicted as relying on mutual trust, intra-familial concern, devotion to others and clan-based collegiality” (Eddleston and Kellermanns, 2007 : 549). The key variables under examination in this study were categorized into professional and personal domains, based on the approach proposed by Solomon, Breunlin, Panattoni, Gustafson, Ransburg, Ryan, and Terrien (2011). The research design and methodology was qualitative and used structured interview data collection techniques for the family business sample, and the Prospective Case Study (PCS) design of Bitektine (2007) for the student data collection phase. The study was conducted in six distinct phases: (1) analysis of current literature on family business; (2) the development of research questions; (3) preliminary pilot study confirming the assumptions and definitions of the previous phase; (4) a series of one-on-one interviews with family business owners; (5) 41 PCS Interviews substantiating the findings on phase four; (6) data analysis and write up. The sample selection criteria consisted of family businesses that had been in operation for a minimum of 25 years, and had or were about to experience generational succession, were owned by one family, employed non-family employees, and were still in operation. As a result, the one-on-one interview sample (Protagonist Interviews) consisted of 16 subjects made up of six incumbents, three successors, four non-family employees, and three independent advisors, all based in Melbourne. The follow-up PCS Interviews numbered 41 family businesses, and were subject to the same interview protocols used for the protagonist interviews. These PCS Interviews were carried out under strict researcher supervision by 41 undergraduate family business students enrolled in a family business unit in a major city-based research university, all of whom either worked in a family business or were family members of that business. In many cases, the students were themselves successors in their family businesses. The choice of the students was consistent with Campbell’s (1975 : 182) observation that “amateur” scientists are relevant and appropriate as professional social scientists in the collection of data with which they are familiar. The research highlighted both similarities and differences in personal and professional variables and their associated components for each of the four protagonists. The findings highlight the value of the family’s culture on the business, the effectiveness of structured protocols in decision-making processes, the capacity of nepotism to compromise transparent family business processes, the management of extended family members by family business leaders, and the importance placed on family cohesion during succession. The information from this study adds to the current literature and highlights the nature of the relationships in family businesses. The study also explores other <b>perspectives</b> on <b>stewardship</b> theory by balancing the interests both of the family and non-family stakeholders. The research also provides information for family business practitioners and independent advisors in the management of generational succession, thus potentially reducing the attrition rate of these valuable economic and social units.
