40|$|ABSTRACT: Almost all {{crude oils}} {{are known to}} contain <b>sulphure</b> in varying amount. The amount of <b>sulphure</b> can vary from 0. 04 % to nearly 10 %. The <b>sulphure</b> in {{petroleum}} {{has been defined as}} consisting of hydrogen sulphide, free <b>sulphure</b> and organic <b>sulphure</b> compound viz mrercaptans, organic sulphide R-S-R, disulphide’s R-S-S-R, carbon disulphide, thiophene and its homologues. The presence of these compound in petroleum fraction is not desirable due to their foul odour, corrosiveness, interferences with combtion characteristics of fuels, aggravation of atm. pollution byproduct of combtion etc. The process used to reduce <b>sulphure</b> content of petroleum fraction may broadly classified as sweeterning process and catalytic desulphurization.

Air pollution has been affecting cultural heritage along with human health. Limestone is one of the most affected building materials from the air pollution. Carbon, <b>sulphure</b> and nitrogen gases are the main components which are affective in the deterioration of limestone and their rate increased with air pollution. <b>Sulphure</b> dioxide (SO 2) reacts with the calcite crystals (CaCO 3) that are the main structure of limestone and leads to the formation of gypsum (CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O). In this study, the formation of gypsum on limestone was investigated on the façade of the Botter Apartment within the restoration and conservation studies. For this purpose physical, mineralogical and chemical compositions of weathered limestone were determined by XRD, SEM-EDS, FT-IR and TGA analyses. The weathering forms caused by air pollution were documented with drawing (mapping) and photographs of front façade of Botter Apartment. The results of the study indicated that gypsum formation on limestone surfaces is mainly originated from wet and dry deposition process of sulphur dioxide. Condensation may also play an important role in gypsum formation on such sheltered surfaces in addition to dry deposition. On sheltered surfaces of limestone, due to the dry deposition of gypsum formation proceeds as black crust formation. The gypsum formation has not restricted on the surface of limestone. Deeper penetration and absorption of <b>sulphure</b> dioxide are observed in limestone because of their more porous structure. In Istanbul average daily temperature is low and average relative humidity and <b>sulphure</b> dioxide concentrations are high in winter time. The results of this study indicated that İstanbul atmosphere, with its coinciding high relative humidity and high <b>sulphure</b> dioxide concentrations in winter have led to gypsum formation on limestone.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{varying levels of}} sulphur dioxide (SO₂) on the cold {{maceration}} process was investigated with Pinot noir (Vitis vinifera L.) wine. The effects of these varying levels on the wines composition and colour parameters were examined. Cold maceration is a technique whereby grapes are crushed and placed at low temperatures (4 - lO°C) in the presence 50 - 150 mgL⁻¹ SO₂. This process is believed to provide a medium for the extraction of water soluble phenolic compounds, rather than the alcoholic extraction employed in normal fermentations. The extraction of these phenolic compounds was monitored from the juice through to six months of bottle age. The changes were measured using both Spectrophotometric and High Performance Liquid Chromatographic (HPLC) procedures. Cold maceration wines {{were found to be}} not significantly different to the control wine in all compositional parameters other than titrateable acidity which was found to be less than the control for all the cold maceration wines. The unsulphured cold maceration wine was not significantly different from the control wine in any of the spectral measurements except natural degree of ionisation, in which it was higher, and total phenolics, in which it was lower. These results indicate that the cold maceration process alone does not alter the extraction of phenolic compounds. The HPLC analysis of the wine confirmed the spectral results indicating that their {{were no significant differences in}} the levels of extraction of anthocyanins. The <b>sulphured</b> cold maceration wines were significantly greater than the control in visible colour, colour density, total anthocyanins, natural degree of ionisation, ionised anthocyanins and total phenolics. These results followed similar patterns with wine ageing, at six months these wines were still significantly greater in all the measurements apart from natural degree of ionisation. The results for the <b>sulphured</b> cold maceration wines indicates that SO₂ is acting as a solvent for the extraction of phenolic compounds including anthocyanins. The 50 mgL⁻¹ SO₂ cold maceration wine had similar colour and phenolic content to the 100 mgL⁻¹ SO₂ cold maceration wine at bottling, at six months the 50 mgL⁻¹ SO₂ cold maceration wine still retained a similar colour to the 100 mgL⁻¹ SO₂ cold maceration wine but had vastly reduced anthocyanin content. This indicates that for the grapes utilised in this study the most appropriate level of addition at cold maceration would be 50 mgL⁻¹ of SO₂.

The flue gas contains tar which should be selectively removed from the fuel components of interest (e. g. H- 2, CO and light hydrocarbons) to avoid condensation and deposits in internal combustion engine. The chosen flue gas treatment is the gas-liquid absorption using solvents, which present specific physicochemical properties (e. g. solubility, viscosity, volatility and chemical and thermal stability) in order to optimize the unit on energetic, technico-economic and environmental criteria. The rational choice of the proper solvent is essential for solving the tar issue. The preselection of the solvents is made using a Hansen parameter in order to evaluate the tar solubility and the saturation vapour pressure of the solvent is obtained using Antoine law. Among the nine families of screened solvents (alcohols, amines, ketones, halogenates, ethers, esters, hydrocarbons, <b>sulphured</b> and chlorinates), acids methyl esters arise as solvents of interest.

The main obstruction to using syngas from fluid gasification of organic matter {{is the presence of}} various high-boiling point hydrocarbons (i. e., tar) in the gas. The elimination of tar from the gas is a key factor in subsequent use of the gas in other technologies for cogeneration of electrical energy and heat. The application of a natural or artificial catalyst for catalytic destruction of tar is one of the methods of secondary elimination of tar from syngas. In our experiments, we used a natural catalyst (dolomite or calcium magnesium carbonate) from Horní Lánov with great mechanical and catalytic properties, suitable for our purposes. The advantages of natural catalysts in contrast to artificial catalysts include their availability, low purchase prices and higher resilience to the so-called catalyst poison.

40|$|The mining {{activity}} in Iacobeni Cârlibaba area dates {{back as far}} as the XIII-th century, the first documentary certification being before 1241. After  1775 (when Bucovina was annexed like province to the Austrian Empire) Iacobeni Cârlibaba area was scientifically examined by Austrian geologists. Geologically and structurally, the Gândacu Suh rzelul Mare mining area belongs to the Crystalline Mesozoic Zone of the Eastern Carpathians. The Crystalline Mesozoic Zone is made up of a system of Alpine Nappes, called the Eastern Central Carpathian Nappes (S ndulescu, 1984).  The exploration and geological surveying work was done in the metamorphic basement of the Sub-Bucovinian Nappe. In the Iacobeni Cârlibaba mining area, the manganese ore deposits are located in the epimetamorphic Tulghe 2 level (Tg 2) of Tulghe lithogroup and the polimetalic <b>sulphures</b> ore deposits in the Tulghe 3 level (Tg 3).  Geographically, the area Gândacu Suh rzelul Mare is situated in the Suhard Mountains, on the right slope of the Golden Bistri a river, from an administrative point of view belonging to Cârlibaba, Cioc ne ti and partially to Iacobeni.  The prospection works outlined three research perimeters: Puiu - Suh rzel, Humoru and Diaca Gândacu.  The geological study in the area Puiu Suh rzel showed the presence of polimetalic sulphures ore in acid riolitic metavulcanites, sericite or sericite-chloritic schists. In the same perimeter, in the superior drainage basin of the Recele brook, its discovered a manganous level in black quartzite with intercalations of sericite-graphitic schists. The manganese ore is predominantly siliceous, made up of lens and nests in parallel disposition. On the left slope of the Suh rzelul Mare brook it uncovered polychrome limestone ores.  In the Humoru and Diaca Gândacu perimeters the prospection works highlighted a primary ore of manganese consisting of rhodonite, rhodochrosite, manganese silicates, quarts, calcite, pyrite, etc. The secondary ore of manganese, resulted from the alteration of the primary ore, appears sporadically and it is made up of manganese and iron oxides and hydroxides.  The prospection and research works in the three perimetres ended in the interval 1991 - 1996. </p...|$|R
40|$|Roasting {{process of}} {{sulphide}} copper concentrates in fluo-solid reactor is an oxidation process, and presents {{the first stage}} of copper concentrate processing in Copper Mining and Smelting Complex Bor, RTB Bor. Therefore, the importance of accurate and up to date process control is an apparent precondition for the correct treatment in the following stages and also for of high grade cathode copper. As concentrate is fed into the roaster, it is heated by a stream of hot air to about 590 °C. The process takes place between solid and gaseous phases without the appearance of a liquid phase. The heat generated by the exothermic oxidation reaction of sulphur from cooper and iron minerals (chalcopyrite and pyrite) is sufficient to carry out the entire process autogenously at temperature from 620 to 670 °C. The temperature of sulphur firing which defines the start of roasting depends on physical traits, particle size of sulfides and characteristic product of oxidation. The obtained products of the roasting process are: calcine, ready for smelting in the furnace and gas-rich <b>sulphure</b> dioxide (SO 2), well suited for the production of sulfuric acid. The relationship between the quantitative mineral composition of the charge and of the calcine directly points out to the efficiency of the roasting process in fluo-solid reactor. The amount of bornite and magnetite, resulting from the sulfide oxidation is the most important parameter. Hence, quantitative determination of mineral composition is of great interest. In this work, the results of the determination of quantitative mineral composition of the copper sulphide concentrate (charge) and products of their roasting (calcine and overflow) in fluo-solid reactor in the RTB Bor are presented. The aim was to compare the results of the iron, copper, sulfur and oxygen contents determined by two independent techniques, the chemical (HA) and X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRPD) that is based on the quantitative mineral composition. Differences in the obtained results are evident, but small enough to confirm the reliability of measurement...|$|R
40|$|Wine yeasts are {{subjected}} to stress conditions that change continuously during a dynamic process such as alcoholic fermentation. Due to utility of DNA chips to investigate how gene expression changes within biological processes, several {{attempts have been made}} on wine yeasts (Perez-Ortin et al., 2002). In this work microarray technology has been used to investigate metabolic shifts at transcriptional level of yeast strains differing for fermentation performances and production of secondary compounds. In particular, a genome-wide expression analysis was performed comparing two commercial yeasts (Lalvin EC 1118 and 71 B) under oenological conditions (50 mg/L of sulphites added at the beginning of vinification). As expected, most of the upregulated genes are stress responsive elements, chaperonins or heat shock proteins (data not shown). The most interesting finding from microarray data regards the different gene expression of sulphur metabolism pathway and sulphite resistance. In particular, sulphur amino acids biosynthesis was up-regulated in 71 B; sulphite uptake/reduction pathway seemed also to be induced. The sulphite efflux permease Ssu 1, involved in sulphite resistance (Park & Bakalinsky, 2000) was also highly expressed. This is consistent with the evidence that yeast can cope with sulphite stress by several mechanisms, such as acetaldehyde production, up-regulation of sulphite uptake and reduction and sulphite efflux from the cell by the membrane pump Ssu 1 (Casalone et al., 1992). Since sulphites are widely used preservatives in foods and beverages, these metabolic pathways have been studied for many years because of their technological interest: their crosslink has been demonstrated and protein involved have been identified; this notwithstanding, their regulation is still unclear (Aranda et al., 2006) especially during alcoholic fermentation. For these reasons a further investigation on microarray data concerning sulphur metabolism was carried out. Time course Real-time PCR experiments were performed for confirming previous evidences: expression level of SSU 1 was tested, together with its transcriptional regulator FZF 1 and two genes belonging to <b>sulphured</b> amino acids biosynthesis pathway (MET 10 and MET 17). These expression data pointed out that in 71 B strain SSU 1 is activated during stationary phase, whereas previous works demonstrated its constitutive expression. This is the first report of a regulated SSU 1 gene expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Therefore its activation mechanism was further investigated by Real-Time PCR gene expression analysis for determining whether the induction is FZF 1 dependent in the two strains. Moreover, sulphite resistance assays were carried out in synthetic must to evaluate physiological effects of the different activation mechanisms. Furthermore, PCR primers were designed to explore the organization SSU 1 locus and its position in the genome, since this gene has been previously described as a marker of genome polymorphism and genetic evolution of wine yeasts (Aa et al., 2006). At the moment, SSU 1 alleles distribution is under investigation by genetic comparison of the same locus in other wine strains; this work is part of a wider project of genetic characterization of autochthonous yeasts strain that will lead to the complete sequencing of four wine yeast genomes...|$|R
