40|$|The Bachman’s Sparrow is {{a member}} of the family Emberizidae, the Sparrows and Towhees. The family {{includes}} 49 species in North America, of which 30 have been observed in North Carolina. The genus Aimophila includes six species in North America, although Bachman’s Sparrow is the only member of the genus that occurs in North Carolina. As a group, sparrows represent an identification challenge, because many of them are similarly marked with streaks of brown and are rather shy, providing observers with only brief glimpses before the birds hide in the vegetation. Description Bachman’s Sparrow is a relatively large sparrow. Its back is streaked with gray, chestnut-brown, and black. The breast and flanks are buffy, becoming paler (nearly white) on the belly. Although the breast is unstreaked, there are small streaks on the sides of the breast. It lacks wing bars. The head has a rusty brown crown stripe and eye line, with gray on the sides of the head. In North Carolina, inexperienced observers are most likely to confuse Bachman’s Sparrow with other sparrows that have an unstreaked breast, particularly <b>Swamp</b> <b>Sparrows</b> in winter. Aside from habitat differences (which are pronounced: <b>Swamp</b> <b>Sparrows</b> prefer wet meadows and marshes, whereas Bachman’s Sparrows prefer open pine woodlands – see below), they can be distinguished by differences in coloration. <b>Swamp</b> <b>Sparrows</b> have a brighter rufous coloration on their wings and back and grayer underparts, while the colors of Bachman’s Sparrows are more muted, and more buffy below.

40|$|Kinematic {{analyses}} {{have demonstrated}} that {{the extent to which}} a songbird 2 ̆ 7 s beak is open when singing correlates with the acoustic frequencies of the sounds produced, suggesting that beak movements function to modulate the acoustic properties of the vocal tract during song production. If motions of the beak are necessary for normal song production, then disrupting the ability of a bird to perform these movements should alter the acoustic properties of its song. We tested this prediction by comparing songs produced normally by white-throated <b>sparrows</b> and <b>swamp</b> <b>sparrows</b> with songs produced when the beak was temporarily immobilized. We also observed how temporarily loading the beak of canaries with extra mass affected vocal tract movements and song production. Disruption of vocal tract movements resulted in the predicted frequency-dependent amplitude changes in the songs of both white-throated <b>sparrows</b> and <b>swamp</b> <b>sparrows.</b> Canaries with mass added to their beak sang with their beak open more widely than normal and produced notes with greater harmonic content than those without weights.

40|$|Female songbirds {{are thought}} to assess males based on aspects of song, such as {{repertoire}} size or amount of singing, that could potentially provide information about male quality. A relatively unexplored aspect of song that also might serve as an assessment signal is a male’s ability to perform physically challenging songs. Trilled songs, such as those produced by <b>swamp</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Melospiza georgiana), present males with a performance challenge because trills require rapid and precise coordination of vocal tract movements, resulting in a trade-off between trill rate and frequency bandwidth. This trade-off defines a constraint on song production observed as a triangular distribution in acoustic space of trill rate by frequency bandwidth, with an upper boundary that represents a performance limit. Given this background on song production constraints, {{we are able to}} identify a priori which songs are performed with a higher degree of proficiency and, thus, which songs should be more attractive to females. We determined the performance limit for a population of <b>swamp</b> <b>sparrows</b> and measured how well individual males performed songs relative to this limit (‘‘vocal performance’’). We then compared female solicitation responses to high-performance versus low-performance versions of the same song type produced by different males.

By testing the birds on all possible pair-wise combinations of syllables, we generated "similarity" matrices for these song syllables from the birds'response latencies to detect {{changes in a}} repeating background of syllables. A number of different statistical techniques were used to examine species differences in perception including factor analysis of an inter-species correlation matrix, cluster analysis ofthe similarity matrices, and individual-differences multidimensional scaling (MDS) of the similarity matrices from each species. The spatial map of these stimuli produced by MDS revealed the perceived relations among these syllables for each species. Several acoustic measurements taken from these syllables were correlated with stimulus coordinates of the syllables in multidimensional space. These results demonstrate that natural vocal signals can be effectively used as stimuli in psychoacoustic experiments and the outcome of such experiments are likely to reveal robust species differences in perception. ...|$|R

40|$|Neural {{mechanisms}} for representing complex communication sounds must {{solve the problem}} of encoding multiple and potentially overlapping signals. Birdsong provides an excellent model for such processing, in that many songbird species produce multiple song types. Although auditory song representations in single song type species have been studied, how song is represented in the brains of species that sing multiple song types remains unknown. Here we examine song type representations in <b>swamp</b> <b>sparrows</b> (Melospiza georgiana), a multiple song type species, by making in vivo intracellular recordings from the telencephalic nucleus HVc, the major auditory-vocal interface in the songbird brain. These recordings show that single HVc relay neurons often generate action potentials to playback of only a single song type, even though synaptic inputs on these cells can be activated by playback of other song types in the bird's repertoire and songs of other birds. These subthreshold response patterns suggest that the song evoked action potential discharge of a single relay neuron is more selective than its presynaptic network. One component of this presynaptic network is likely to be in HVc, because multiple recordings from single birds show that different relay neurons can respond best to different song types, whereas single interneurons can generate action potentials to all song types in the bird's repertoire. These results show that single HVc neurons can generate song type-specific action potential responses, a feature that may facilitate the selective auditory encoding of multiple learned vocalizations in a single brain area...|$|R
40|$|Shriver, W. GregoryIn North American tidal marshes, {{prescribed}} burning has been employed to manage waterfowl, furbearers, invasive plants, and fuels {{since at least}} the 1930 ???s. Prescribed burning may also affect non-target species, such as marsh birds, but few studies have examined these potential impacts, particularly in the mid-Atlantic region. To address this informational need, I studied breeding secretive marsh birds on the Chesapeake Bay in Dorchester County, Maryland, where prescribed marsh burning has been conducted for at least 70 years. I examined the effect of time since fire on density, nest success, productivity and occupancy. Seaside Sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus maritimus) were the most abundant species in the study area. Seaside Sparrow density was greatest on 2 - 4 months post-fire marshes, and densities decreased as time since fire increased. Seaside Sparrow nest survival rates were lowest on 5 or more years post-fire marshes, and highest on 3 - 4 years post-fire marshes. Nest survival was also dependent on landscape context and annual weather variation. Least Bittern (Ixobrychus exilis) and Virginia Rail (Rallus limicola) occupancy was positively influenced by fire. Saltmarsh Sparrows (Ammodramus caudacutus) appear to have a delayed response to winter prescribed burns, as occupancy was negatively impacted by burning over the short-term (3 years), but positively impacted over the long-term (24 years). Coastal Plain <b>Swamp</b> <b>Sparrows</b> (Melospiza georgiana nigrescens) occupied only ecotonal habitat, and did not respond strongly to prescribed burns. I found that prescribed marsh burning had a positive effect on Least Bittern, Virginia Rail, and Saltmarsh Sparrow occupancy, and that Seaside Sparrows were abundant in burned areas. However, there was some evidence that predation may increase immediately following a burn, which may have negatively impacted Seaside Sparrow nest success and productivity on marshes burned 2 - 4 months ago. The natural fire frequency of the study area has been estimated to be 4 - 6 years, indicating that marsh birds may have adapted to occasional fire events. For these reasons, I recommend burning once every 3 - 4 years to maintain habitat quality for breeding secretive marsh birds. University of Delaware, Department of Entomology and Wildlife EcologyM.

40|$|Although Aves {{is one of}} the best-studied taxa, {{much remains}} to be learned about marsh bird populations. Understanding species-environment {{relationships}} for marsh birds is complicated by the low detection probabilities of many species and the challenges associated with sampling wetland habitats. I evaluated habitat relationships at multiple spatial scales for a marsh passerine, the <b>Swamp</b> <b>Sparrow</b> (M. g. georgiana), in the Great Lakes Region. At the local scale, I monitored breeding Swamp Sparrows at restored and natural marshes and assessed the degree to which habitat attributes influenced nesting success. I hypothesized that nesting success would be lower in restored marshes because of shallower water depths and differences in vegetation composition that may increase nest site accessibility to predators or alter food resources. The daily nest survival rate varied as a quadratic function of date, with survival being highest {{in the middle of the}} nesting season. Pooled daily nest survival rates were 0. 917 (SE = 0. 010) for the restored marshes and 0. 937 (SE = 0. 009) for the natural marshes. The nest success rate of 0. 11 for restored marshes was significantly less than the nest success rate of 0. 18 in natural marshes. All four marshes appeared to function as demographic sinks, although there were large uncertainties in estimated adult and juvenile survival rates. ^ At the patch or wetland scale, I surveyed 21 wetlands using the North American Marsh Bird Monitoring Protocol to compare detection probabilities, species densities, and marsh bird community composition at restored and natural marshes. I expected that detection probabilities and community composition would be generally similar, although I expected slightly fewer wetland species at restored marshes because of lower water levels. I recorded 35 wetland-associated species, comprised of 30 species at natural marshes and 31 species at restored marshes. I estimated detection probabilities for the <b>Swamp</b> <b>Sparrow,</b> Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), and Song Sparrow (Melospiza melodia). Detection probabilities differed among species but did not differ between restored and natural marshes. Densities of these three species were similar in natural marshes; however, Swamp Sparrows trended toward lower densities in restored marshes. Species richness and similarity and diversity indices suggested that the breeding bird communities were similar at restored and natural marshes. ^ At the population scale, I modeled <b>Swamp</b> <b>Sparrow</b> abundance and evaluated how the choice of spatial and temporal scales used to aggregate Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data influenced model fit and performance. I hypothesized that <b>Swamp</b> <b>Sparrow</b> abundance would be negatively influenced by the amount of cropland and medium- and high-density development, road density, and temperature, and be positively influenced by the amount of wetland area, stream density, and winter precipitation. I expected that models based on intermediate spatial data aggregation scales (e. g., 5 -stop or 10 -stop segments) would exhibit the highest concordance with environmental variables but that route-scale models would exhibit the best performance. All top-ranked models of <b>Swamp</b> <b>Sparrow</b> abundance contained a measure of proximal wetland land cover. The highest concordance between wetland land cover and <b>Swamp</b> <b>Sparrow</b> abundance occurred at small rather than intermediate spatial extents, ranging from 200 m to 400 m from BBS stops, segments, or routes. Contrary to my expectations, road density, the amount of cropland, and the amount of high- and medium-density development did not exhibit a strong negative effect on <b>Swamp</b> <b>Sparrow</b> abundance. The average temperature recorded during each breeding bird survey influenced <b>Swamp</b> <b>Sparrow</b> abundance within a single year, but this effect disappeared when counts were summed over multiple years. Winter precipitation positively influenced <b>Swamp</b> <b>Sparrow</b> abundance aggregated for 5 -stop and 10 -stop segments, but was not a significant predictor in route-scale models. Route-scale models exhibited the best performance, with Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s rank coefficients between observed and predicted mean values averaging 0. 47. Correlation coefficients for models based on 5 -stop and 10 -stop segments ranged from 0. 26 to 0. 38. My findings confirm that Breeding Bird Survey data may be useful for monitoring and modeling the populations of abundant marsh birds; however, greater uncertainty may be present in marsh bird models based on fine spatial and temporal data aggregation scales.
