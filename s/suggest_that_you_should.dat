2500|$|At {{the same}} time, British Foreign Secretary Earl Curzon {{wrote to the}} High Commissioner, Herbert Samuel, in August 1920, stating, [...] "I <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> {{let it be known}} {{forthwith}} that in the area south of the Sykes-Picot line, we will not admit French authority and that our policy for this area to be independent but in closest relations with Palestine." [...] Samuel replied to Curzon, [...] "After the fall of Damascus a fortnight ago...Sheiks and tribes east of Jordan utterly dissatisfied with Shareefian Government most unlikely would accept revival." [...] He subsequently announced that Transjordan was under British Mandate. Without authority from London, Samuel then visited Transjordan and at a meeting with 600 leaders in Salt, announced the independence of the area from Damascus and its absorption into the mandate, quadrupling the area under his control by tacit capitulation. Samuel assured his audience that Transjordan would not be merged with Palestine. The foreign secretary, Lord Curzon, repudiated Samuel's action.|$|E

6000|$|... “I {{should be}} {{the last person to}} <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> do {{anything}} that you ought not to do to—” began Mrs. Bebberly Cumble impressively.|$|E
6000|$|... "I never <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> coerce her, {{as you put}} it. I merely meant <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{could point}} out to her, as a father, where her duty and {{happiness}} lie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps,' said Mr. Tryan, feeling {{slightly}} uncomfortable, 'since you are {{not very}} strong, my dear sir, it will be well, as Mrs. Jerome <b>suggests,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not {{run the risk of}} any excitement.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{deceased}} <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> {{come with}} him then and there to see Lord Radclyffe at Grosvenor Square; he hailed a taxicab and you entered it with him," [...] insisted the coroner with sudden, slow emphasis.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can only}} <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> {{postpone}} any decision until {{the effect of}} this misunderstanding has had time to wear off. You have now known each other--" [...] he began.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear friend," [...] he remonstrated, [...] "of {{what use}} {{in the world is}} revenge? I do not <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> throw your money away trying to help Bultiwell, but you might at least have left him alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; but I cannot repress my {{admiration for}} the ways of Divine Justice. If you are come to me for advice, I can but <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> follow your brother's captors to Taunton, and inform the lieutenants of how the letter came into your power." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{daughter}} <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> disguise {{yourself as}} a woman," [...] she said. [...] "And indeed in point of height you might pass well, seeing <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are but little taller than myself. But I fear <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are far too widely built across the shoulders to wear my clothes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Gresham {{has made}} his {{acceptance}} of office,--well, I will not say strictly conditional on your joining him. That would hardly be correct. But he has expressed himself quite {{willing to make the}} attempt with your aid, and doubtful whether he can succeed without it. He <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> join him as President of the Council." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, sir. It was {{to prevent}} any such {{contingency}} <b>that</b> I <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> bicycle to Kingham Manor. When I informed the ladies and gentlemen that I had found the key, and it was borne in upon them <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were having <b>that</b> long ride for nothing, their animosity vanished immediately, {{to be replaced by}} cordial amusement. There was much laughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What? Changed your mind, have you, Mr. Weathercock? Well, {{it is the}} {{prerogative}} of all feminine natures--but, your doublet is awry, and allow me to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> brush your hair. There, that's better; now, come on. No, you go first, if you please, I'd rather have you in front of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. Not probable; {{certainly}} not; but it's possible. Great {{interest will}} probably be made. If I might venture to advise your lordship, I would <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> discuss the matter with his grace next week. I {{have no doubt that}} your wishes, if made known and backed by his grace, would be paramount with Lord ----." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I would <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> {{have the}} {{question}} {{asked in a}} friendly way. Get some independent member, such as Mr. Beverley or Sir James Deering, to ask it. The matter would then be brought forward in no carping spirit, and you would be enabled, through Mr. Finn, to set the matter at rest. You have probably spoken to the Duke about it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Krishnan was an {{ecological}} patriot {{in that he}} opposed the introduction of exotic trees. He was once asked {{to speak at the}} Indian Institute of Science at Bangalore and in late February, the Tabebuia trees were ablaze in flowers. Asked about his opinion on the flowers, he declared it as 'Disgraceful' and <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> ... <b>you</b> <b>should</b> uproot all those foreign trees, and plant some of our own.|$|R
40|$|I {{hope you}} will set your goal {{just a little bit}} higher and then put forth a real effort to attain or surpass it. Do a little each day toward your goal. Most people never get to their {{objective}} for the simple reason they quit too soon. ”- Margaret Sloss “Two ears and one mouth <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> listen twice as much as you talk. ”- Author unknown...|$|R
6000|$|... "Joe Bevan!" [...] cried Mr Spence. [...] "Really? Why, {{he trained}} me when I boxed for Cambridge. He's {{one of the}} best of fellows. I've never seen any one who took such trouble with his man. I wish we could get him here. So it was Joe who <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> go down to Aldershot? Well, he ought to know. Did he say you would have a good chance?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good. Then you authorize me to {{tell her}} that she's been mistaken, and there was nothing but a little fun in it? You've no doubt, Katharine, in your own mind? Cassandra is in our charge, and I don't intend that people should gossip about her. I <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> be a little more careful in future. Invite me to your next entertainment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May I be {{permitted}} {{a word or}} two of advice? Stick as near to the truth as possible--it minimizes the danger of 'slips.' I <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> represent yourself to be what you are, a former V.A.D., who has chosen domestic service as a profession. There are many such at the present time. That explains away any incongruities of voice or manner which otherwise might awaken suspicion.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Wagner added {{largely to}} his amazement, by informing {{him of the}} {{position}} that she held in the firm. [...] "If you come on a matter of business," [...] she proceeded, [...] "you may trust me to understand you, sir, though I am only a woman. If your visit relates to private affairs, I beg to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> write to Mr. Keller--I will take care that he receives your letter the moment he returns." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I say I {{suppose you}} don't. Don't {{interrupt}} me--I have <b>suggested</b> this: <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> remain here six months, and that {{then he should}} come again and see--" ...|$|R
60|$|For {{many types}} that, however, {{is exactly what}} happens with public worship. They DO get a King Log in ceremony. And if you {{deliberately}} overcome and suppress your perception of and repugnance to the perfunctoriness of religion in nine-tenths of the worshippers about you, you may be destroying {{at the same time}} your own intellectual and moral sensitiveness. But I am not <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> force yourself to take part in public worship against your perceptions, but only that if it helps you to worship <b>you</b> <b>should</b> not hesitate to do so.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] said M. de La Tour d'Azyr, slowly, [...] "that {{we are at}} cross-purposes. I {{asked you}} to come here because the Chateau de Gavrillac was hardly a {{suitable}} {{place in which to}} carry our discussion further, and because I hesitated to incommode <b>you</b> by <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> come all the way to Azyr. But my object is connected with certain expressions <b>that</b> <b>you</b> let fall up there. It is on the subject of those expressions, monsieur, that I would hear you further--if you will honour me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My plan {{involves}} much danger; but I see no other, and I {{think you}} have courage to brave it. It is this. There is an island about fifty {{miles to the south}} of this, the natives of which are Christians, and have been so for two years or more, and the principal chief is Avatea's lover. Once there, Avatea would be safe. Now, I <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> abandon your schooner. Do you think that you can make so great a sacrifice?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well;--if you can't, {{and if you}} won't take {{my advice}} about going out;-- which, pray, think about, for you would be most useful. It might be the very making of the railway;--then I can only <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> take your £6,000 and leave us. I, myself, should be greatly distressed; {{but if you are}} {{determined}} that way I will see that you have your money. I will make myself personally responsible for the payment of it,--some time {{before the end of the}} year.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly--certainly! In {{the present}} state of my practice," [...] as he glanced at the solitary brief, [...] "I should be the last to wish to turn away work. Let me <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> go and consult my brother John, in the Poultry. I believe {{business}} is rather slack with him just now, so I think it probable that you will find him disengaged. Indeed, I dare say that I may {{go so far as to}} make an appointment for him here--let us say in an hour's time. Stop! I will consult my clerk! Dick!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{fact remains}} as I have stated it," [...] Lord Chelsford said slowly. [...] "My {{information}} is positive. When {{you came to}} me and <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> make two copies of everything, one correct, one a mass of incorrectness, I must admit that I thought the idea farfetched and unworkable. Events, however, have proved otherwise. I have safely received everything which you sent me, and up to the present, with the exception of that first plan of the Winchester forts, our secrets are unknown. But now we have come to a deadlock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Evidently Foy has a {{story to}} tell," [...] said Adrian wearily, [...] "and the sooner he rids his mind of it the sooner {{he will be able}} to wash. I <b>suggest,</b> Foy, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> begin at the beginning." ...|$|R
5000|$|Based on {{studies done}} at MIT and other universities, higher pay and bonuses {{resulted}} in better performance ONLY if the task consisted of basic, mechanical skills. It worked for {{problems with a}} defined set of steps and a single answer. If the task involved cognitive skills, decision-making, creativity, or higher-order thinking, higher pay resulted in lower performance. As a supervisor, <b>you</b> <b>should</b> pay employees enough {{that they are not}} focused on meeting basic needs and feel that they are being paid fairly. If you don’t pay people enough, they won’t be motivated. Pink <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> pay enough “to take the issue of money off the table.” ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have now}} gone {{carefully}} through the papers as to your seat, and [...] {{looked at the}} precedents, and though I admit that the case is a [...] curious one, and {{the words of the}} statute not happily chosen, yet [...] I have come clearly and without doubt to the same conclusion as [...] Jessel, and I shall be quite prepared if need be to argue the [...] case in that sense in parliament. Still it may be very proper, as [...] you yourself <b>suggest,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have a written and formal [...] opinion of the law officers and Bowen upon it.(296) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} safe now, mademoiselle," [...] he said to Marie, [...] "for us to proceed. There {{are plenty of people}} about in the streets; but as the news has, no doubt, already been spread that the daughters of the Marquis de St. Caux had left the house before those charged with their father's arrest arrived, it will be better for you not to keep together. I would <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> walk on with Virginie. I will follow with Jeanne a hundred yards behind, so that I can keep you in sight, and will come up if anyone should accost you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then, Mrs. Malory, {{as it is}} {{awkward to}} discuss these {{intimate}} matters with me, might I <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> have an interview with Mrs. Brown-Smith herself? I assure you that you can trust her, and I happen to know that her view of the man about whom we are talking is exactly your own. More I could say as to her reasons and motives, but we entirely decline to touch on the past or to offer any opinion about the characters of our patients--the persons about whose engagements we are consulted. He might have murdered his grandmother or robbed a church, but my lips would be sealed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{are really}} not busy," [...] he said, [...] "I was about to <b>suggest</b> to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> come back to town with me and lunch. I do not expect, of course, to take up your day for nothing," [...] he continued. [...] "You will understand, as a {{professional}} man, that when your services are required by the authorities, they expect {{and are willing to}} pay for them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Honour {{does not}} for instance, <b>suggest</b> to <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> repair to the Conciergerie {{and take the}} place <b>that</b> belongs to <b>you,</b> and which another is filling?" ...|$|R
40|$|If you’re in London, {{and want}} {{to play it safe}} by {{following}} the trends and becoming part of the popular local “food stream,” current research <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> eat a burger followed by Neapolitan ice cream. If you’re in Montreal, it’s poutine and vanilla ice cream. In New York, it’s sushi followed by chocolate ice cream. The data are clear; this is what people are eating in these cities (Canadian Dairy Information Centre, 2016; Diamond, 2015; Swanson, 2015; Victor, 2015). So, {{if you want to be}} a part of the crowd and eat foods <b>that</b> <b>you</b> know you can find in these locations, then these are by far your best choices. And, if a highly regarded external rating of the cook drives your food choices, then maybe it’s time for a burger made by a Michelin star chef for your next meal (Lendrum, 2016) ...|$|R
