5|$|Larter {{said she}} was a tomboy until she turned 13. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>she</b> sprouted six inches, gained weight and {{significant}} curves. The next year she was signed by the Ford modeling agency. Larter began her modeling career at the age of 14 when a modeling scout discovered her on the street and was asked to star in a Phillies commercial; this led to a modeling contract with the prestigious Ford Modeling Agency in New York. Larter subsequently skipped her senior year to model in Australia, Italy, and Japan, the latter a country she would temporarily settle in at the age of seventeen.|$|E

She also reveals it is Elspeth’s destiny, as the Seeker, to destroy them. After {{mourning}} her death, Elspeth overhears that Rushton, imprisoned in the next cavern, is the true heir of Obernewtyn. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>she</b> is captured by Ariel, who ties her to a table next to the Zebkrahn machine. Elspeth is forced to hold the diaries of Marisa Seraphim, the wife of the founder of Obernewtyn and Alexi's stepmother, and use her abilities to discover what Marisa was thinking when she wrote them to determine the weapons’ location.

500|$|On {{her first}} day in the city, Goldman met two men who would forever change her life. At Sachs's Café, a {{gathering}} place for radicals, she was introduced to Alexander Berkman, an anarchist who invited her to a public speech that evening. They went to hear Johann Most, editor of a radical publication called Freiheit and an advocate of [...] "propaganda of the deed"—the use of violence to instigate change. She was impressed by his fiery oration, and he took her under his wing, training her in methods of public speaking. He encouraged her vigorously, telling {{her that she was}} [...] "to take my place when I am gone." [...] One of her first public talks in support of [...] "the Cause" [...] was in Rochester. After convincing Helena not to tell their parents of her speech, Goldman found her mind a blank once on stage. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>she</b> later wrote: ...|$|E

500|$|The {{first of}} twenty-eight books in Blyton's Old Thatch series, The Talking Teapot and Other Tales, was {{published}} in 1934, {{the same year as}} the first book in her Brer Rabbit series, Brer Rabbit Retold; (note that Brer Rabbit originally featured in Uncle Remus stories by Joel Chandler Harris), her first serial story and first full-length book, Adventures of the Wishing-Chair, followed in 1937. The Enchanted Wood, the first book in the Faraway Tree series, published in 1939, is about a magic tree inspired by the Norse mythology that had fascinated Blyton as a child. According to Blyton's daughter Gillian the inspiration for the magic tree came from [...] "thinking up a story one day and <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> was walking in the enchanted wood and found the tree. In her imagination she climbed up through the branches and met Moon-Face, Silky, the Saucepan Man {{and the rest of the}} characters. She had all she needed." [...] As in the Wishing-Chair series, these fantasy books typically involve children being transported into a magical world in which they meet fairies, goblins, elves, pixies and other mythological creatures.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} starts {{off with a}} blue monitor screen with an eye showing the {{inscription}} [...] "Welcome". The video progresses inside a blue space ship-style room with Madonna lying prostrate in {{what seems to be}} a scientific experiment. The imagery cast in this section of the video have drawn comparisons to hermeticism. The video progresses into a sequence of dreams, containing varied surrealistic, mystic, new age, Sufi and Egyptian imagery and symbolism. Such include a scene in which Madonna lies on a rotating sunflower, and images of a woman with long hair, an alchemist-type man holding a cube with Madonna's face on each side as well as rotating Sufi dancers. The dream sequence progresses with unusual clips, including Madonna in a pool with half-visible skulls. A scene in which Madonna, dressed in a light dressing gown, gives birth to doves, can also be seen; the image has been compared to the work of René Magritte and Kahlo's 1932 painting My Birth. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>she</b> floats down a corridor in a white gown and appears in a black-and-white projection in a cinema-like room. As the music gets more dramatic, the dream grows intense, with images of skulls and scars appearing, and the singer can be seen wading through space. A scene in which Madonna's eyes are replaced with her mouth and her mouth with an eye precedes the ending, influenced by the work of Kahlo; the final shots show Madonna waking up and looking out.|$|E
500|$|Hearsay and {{conjecture}} have clouded {{assessment of}} the Duchess of Windsor's life, not helped by her own manipulation of the truth. But there is no document which proves directly that she was {{anything other than a}} victim of her own ambition, who lived out a great romance that became a great tragedy. In the opinion of her biographers, [...] "she experienced the ultimate fairy tale, becoming the adored favourite of the most glamorous bachelor of his time. The idyll went wrong when, ignoring her pleas, he threw up his position {{to spend the rest of}} his life with her." [...] Academics agree that she ascended a precipice that [...] "left her with fewer alternatives than she had anticipated. Somehow she thought that the Establishment could be overcome once [...] was king, and she confessed frankly to Aunt Bessie about her 'insatiable ambitions'... Trapped by his flight from responsibility into exactly the role she had sought, <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> warned him, in a letter, 'You and I can only create disaster together'... she predicted to society hostess Sibyl Colefax, 'two people will suffer' because of 'the workings of a system'... Denied dignity, and without anything useful to do, the new Duke of Windsor and his Duchess would be international society's most notorious parasites for a generation, while they thoroughly bored each other... She had thought of him as emotionally a Peter Pan, and of herself an Alice in Wonderland. The book they had written together, however, was a Paradise Lost." [...] The Duchess herself is reported to have summed up her life in a sentence: [...] "You have no idea how hard it is to live out a great romance." ...|$|E
500|$|The video commences with Till {{arguing with}} his girlfriend through a phone call. As soon as Swift, as the protagonist, notices, they begin to {{communicate}} by holding up signs through their bedroom windows. Till closes his curtains, and Swift holds up a sign saying, [...] "I love you". As the song's chorus approaches, Swift starts to sing and dance {{in front of a}} mirror, changing to different clothing multiple times. Afterward, Swift is sitting in a bench while reading a book. Till arrives and the two converse. Then, Swift, as the antagonist, arrives in a red convertible car and Till gets in it; Swift, the antagonist, kisses him and gives a hostile look towards the protagonist. <b>Suddenly,</b> <b>she</b> is seen cheerleading at a football game while Swift's other persona is in the bleachers, performing in the school band. After scoring the winning touchdown, Till moves toward his girlfriend and finds her flirting with a teammate, resulting in a heated argument which results in their breakup. Meanwhile, Swift, the protagonist stares in amazement. Back in their bedroom windows, they again communicate through signs, Till asked Swift, the protagonist, if she was attending prom and she responded, [...] "no, studying". Swift, however, notices Till has a dejected expression as he leaves and changes her mind. Shortly after, Swift is seen entering prom with a white dress, no longer looking like a nerd, while all her peers stare in amazement. When Till spots her, he walks towards her and Swift, the antagonist in a red dress, attempts to impede him, but he ignores her. Ending the video, Till and Swift reveal folded signs saying [...] "I love you" [...] and kiss. To date, the video has over 770 million views on YouTube, making it the most viewed country song on YouTube.|$|E

2500|$|The two {{enter the}} throne room {{as members of}} the court join them: (Chorus: Imponga il Re: noi siamo servi del suo voler [...] / [...] "Let the King give us his orders"). Elena, puzzled by the courtiers' {{behaviour}} towards [...] "Uberto", <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> realises that Uberto and King James are one. King James, softened by his affection for Elena, decides to forgive Douglas; but he makes a show of severity by condemning Malcolm. [...] Finally, he relents and brings the young couple together. In her rondo finale, Elena rejoices to have saved both her father and her true love, while everyone else rejoices that peace has been restored: (Rondo: Tanti affetti in tal momento! mi si fanno al core intorno, che l’immenso mio contento / [...] "So many emotions at such moment / Come clamouring about my heart / That I cannot explain to you / My immense happiness") ...|$|E
2500|$|... "You {{have all}} these great stories in the book," [...] I told her, [...] "Why don't you use them in the song?" [...] I knew that Madonna was {{developing}} a 1930s dominatrix look for Erotica, but I didn't realize how far {{she was willing to}} go before I saw Sex. It contained stories authored by her mysteriously dark alter, Dita. Madonna took the book {{and walked out of the}} room and didn't come back until about half an hour later. <b>Suddenly</b> <b>she</b> was on the mic, speaking in this very dry voice. [...] "My name is Dita," [...] she said, [...] "and I'll be your mistress tonight." [...] I knew that the original [...] "Erotica" [...] would never be the same again, and it wasn't. The chorus and bridge were changed entirely and the whole psyche of the song became sexier, more to the point. It seemed as if Dita brought out the best in her, actually serving as a vehicle for the dangerous territory she was traveling. Actually, it was the same name Madonna used when she'd stay in hotels around the world. Not anymore.|$|E
2500|$|Lexa is {{the first}} Grounder leader to seek peace, which Debnam-Carey {{described}} as [...] "somewhat difficult" [...] for the other Grounders to understand because of their [...] "rough and aggressive" [...] culture; she is also [...] "the first person to unite the 12 clans and to actually {{have the option of}} an alliance." [...] Throughout, she is extremely loyal, but more so to her own people; she puts them first regardless of the cost. Debnam-Carey said [...] "it's in [...] blood" [...] to put her people first because they [...] "are so close to her, that's what she's been groomed to be. She comes from a really harsh culture and she has huge responsibilities." [...] Lexa is [...] "brutal and she's a pragmatist, but not out of unkindness. It's all she's ever known." [...] Debnam-Carey did not view Lexa as a teenager, and did not assign her an age, stating, [...] "It's almost like she skipped that period. She was placed in a position where <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> was forced {{to make a lot of}} hard choices that most people never have to make, no matter what their age is. The 100 is a world where you don't ever really get to be a kid." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the September 1, 1995, {{article for}} the Shambhala Sun, [...] "bell hooks talks to John Perry Barlow", Barlow {{reflects}} upon Cynthia Horner passing away: [...] "It {{seems to me that}} what we’re here to do is to learn about love in the presence of fear... You pass away from the moment into the infinite, where there are no moments and where there’s no time. Here in an embodied state, the body, like all physical things, participates in entropy and all the other artifacts of time. There’s a thin but nevertheless impermeable membrane between the chronological and the timeless that has become much more real to me since my lover died a year ago. Even though I feel her soul, the absence of her body feels like an enormous barrier. The absence of the spoken word, the absence of the sound of her voice, or the touch of her skin. All the things that only can be done by souls with bodies on them... But you know the only time that I feel in contact with her, really, is when her spirit temporarily borrows someone else’s body to dance. Like the moment that you and I were dancing up in your apartment a few months ago. And <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> was in you and I could feel her there. You quit dancing the way you danced and started dancing the way she danced. And it was almost like a practical joke that she was playing in a way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{production}} overhaul and the studio's attempts for more cost-efficient animated features, Mark Dindal urged for [...] "a simpler approach that emphasized the characters rather than overwhelming special effects or cinematic techniques". Because {{of the subsequent}} departure of Deja, animator Dale Baer inherited the character of Yzma. Using Eartha Kitt's gestures during recording sessions, Baer commented that [...] "She has a natural voice for animation and really got into the role. She would gesture wildly and it was fun just to watch her. She would come into each session almost serious and very professional and <b>suddenly</b> <b>she</b> would go wild and break up laughing." [...] Ranieri was later asked {{to serve as the}} supervising animator of Kuzco (as a human and a llama), though he would admit being reluctant at first until he discovered that Kuzco [...] "had a side to him, {{there was a lot of}} comedy potential and as a character he went through an arc". Pudleiner was also reassigned to work as an animator of the human version of Kuzco. In addition to drawing inspiration from David Spade during recording sessions, the Kuzco animation team studied llamas at the zoo, visited a llama farm, watched nature documentaries, and even observed the animals up close when they came for a visit to the studio. For the rewritten version of Pacha, animator Bruce W. Smith observed that [...] "Pacha is probably the most human of all the characters," [...] and further added that he [...] "has more human mannerisms and realistic traits, which serve as a contrast to the cartoony llama he hangs out with. He is the earthy guy who brings everything back into focus. Being a big fellow about six-foot-five and weighing about 250 pounds we had to work hard to give him a sense of weight and believability in his movement." ...|$|E
