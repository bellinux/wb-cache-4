We had sent Ken Joy, the former BBAR, to {{challenge}} for the Grand Prix des Nations, then 140 kilometres long, and dragging through the hills of the Chevreuse valley. All over Paris they talked about this burly Englishman who had ridden 160km in 4 hours and 6 minutes: and when it came to it, he was hammered by a 19-year-old, but a teenager with a will of iron that was to prove inflexible for the next 19 years.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the stage}} {{directions}} in The Tempest are so precise, critics and historians {{are better able}} to <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> play may have originally been performed than with other Shakespearean plays. Several of the scenes involving magic have clear instructions on how to create the illusion required, causing critics to make connections and guesses as to exactly what sort of technology would have been used in Shakespeare's troupe to stage Ariel's role in the play. Also, a line by Ariel in Act IV brings other scholars to ask questions as to whether the original actor for Ariel played the part for Ceres as well, due to a shortage of boy actors.|$|E

When Tiresias arrives {{he claims to}} know the answers to Oedipus's questions, but refuses to speak, instead telling him to abandon his search. Oedipus is enraged by Tiresias' refusal, and {{verbally}} accuses him of complicity in Laius' murder. Outraged, Tiresias tells the king that Oedipus himself is the murderer ("You yourself are the criminal you seek"). Oedipus cannot <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> could be, and concludes that the prophet must have been paid off by Creon {{in an attempt to}} undermine him. The two argue vehemently, as Oedipus mocks Tiresias' lack of sight, and Tiresias in turn tells Oedipus that he himself is blind. Eventually Tiresias leaves, muttering darkly that when the murderer is discovered he shall be a native citizen of Thebes, brother and father to his own children, and son and husband to his own mother.|$|E

500|$|According to Nicholson, Agharta {{and other}} jazz-rock {{recordings}} such as Emergency! (1970) by the Tony Williams Lifetime suggested the genre was progressing toward [...] "a whole new musical language... a wholly independent genre {{quite apart from}} the sound and conventions of anything that had gone before". This development dwindled with the commercialism of jazz in the 1980s, he said, although Agharta remained a pivotal and influential record through the 1990s, especially on artists in the experimental rock genre. It became one of the favorite albums for English musician Richard Kirk, who recalled playing the record often while working at Chris Watson's loft during their early years in the band Cabaret Voltaire. [...] "I can <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> album might have annoyed people but for me it was really nice grooves with improvisation and would open out and become more minimal", Kirk later told The Quietus. Along with On the Corner, it was also a major influence on the Beastie Boys' 1994 hip hop album Ill Communication. In 1998, composer and bandleader David Sanford completed his dissertation on Agharta as a doctoral student in composition at Princeton University. In it, he argued that the album demonstrated how jazz has utilized a variety of external influences [...] "to evolve or modernize itself". In an interview several years later, Sanford said it was an important work that had gone to the [...] "fringes of jazz" [...] and a place most other music has not explored since. In the All Music Guide to Jazz (2002), Thom Jurek considered the album to be inarguably the [...] "greatest electric funk-rock jazz record ever" [...] and declared [...] "there is simply nothing like Agharta in the canon of recorded music." ...|$|E
