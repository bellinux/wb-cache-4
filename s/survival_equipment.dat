In January–February 1979, two No.37 Squadron C-130Es {{evacuated}} Australian and other foreign embassy staff from Tehran, shortly before the collapse of royal rule during the Iranian Revolution. During April 1982, a C-130H was fitted with aerial firefighting equipment acquired from the United States Forest Service for trials purposes; several Hercules later used this equipment to fight bushfires. On 5 April 1983, 23 of the RAAF's Hercules performed a formation flight over Sydney; the remaining aircraft was to have participated in this flight but was diverted to conduct a search-and-rescue task. The Hercules' twelve-hour endurance and ability to drop <b>survival</b> <b>equipment</b> over land or sea made it a useful aircraft for such missions. In 1986, No.37 Squadron transported the Popemobiles during John PaulII's tour of Australia; its other unusual cargoes have included a Murray Grey stud bull presented to the Chinese Government in 1973, kangaroos and sheep for Malaysia, and archaeological exhibits from China.|$|E

25|$|The air-sea rescue squadrons of the ASRS flew {{a variety}} of aircraft, usually hand me downs {{rejected}} or withdrawn from front line service by the RAF's other branches or {{as in the case}} of the Walrus begged from the Navy. They used Supermarine Spitfires and Boulton Paul Defiants to patrol for downed aircrew and Avro Ansons to drop supplies and dinghies. Supermarine Walrus and Supermarine Sea Otter amphibious craft were used to pick up aircrew from the water. Larger aircraft were used to drop airborne lifeboats. Although the Walrus and Sea Otters could pick up survivors in calm seas, further out to sea and in rougher waters, it was still not possible for aircraft to routinely pick up survivors, the large flying boats that could do so, such as the Catalinas and Short Sunderlands of Coastal Command, had many other jobs to do and were not always available. The role of aircraft in the ASRS therefore, was to locate downed airmen and to keep them alive, by dropping them <b>survival</b> <b>equipment</b> and stores, until an ASRS launch, or one from the Royal Navy's Naval Sea Rescue Services, arrived to pick them up. Generally MCS launches had responsibility for the Channel and North Sea, and Navy ones for the Western Approaches.|$|E

40|$|Statistical {{data shows}} {{that a large number}} of {{maritime}} accidents are related to recreational craft. For instance, in Spain, more than fifty percent of the emergencies are related to pleasure boats at sea. Recreational craft marketed in the EU must comply with harmonized technical safety and environmental requirements defined by Directive 94 / 25 /EC, as amended in 2003. On 28 December 2013, the new recreational craft directive 2013 / 53 /EU was published in the Official Journal of the European Union. EU Member States have until 18 January 2016 to amend their national legislation and transpose the new directive. The current directive 94 / 25 /EC as amended by directive 2003 / 44 /EC will be repealed on 18 January 2016, after the full application of the new text.

40|$|It is {{generally}} held that leukocytes are found within bruised subcutaneous tissues within 4 – 12 h of injury {{as part of}} a standard cellular response to trauma. As a corollary, the absence of leukocytes is often cited as evidence of more recent injury. To investigate how long after injury it may be before a leukocyte response occurs selected bruises from three children aged 27, 11, and 3 months, respectively, were examined microscopically. All of the children had sustained lethal head trauma, with <b>survival</b> on life-support <b>equipment</b> for some time in hospital, and with bruises of at least 24 -h duration confirmed by medical evaluation (at 30, 44, and 79 h from the time of initial medical evaluation to death). Histologic examination of selected lesions in all three cases revealed extravasation of red blood cells within subcutaneous tissues, but no leukocyte infiltration or other cellular reaction. Other bruises in these children exhibited a standard inflammatory response. This study has shown that selected bruises in three children were present for at least 30 h without a leukocyte infiltrate. Caution should, therefore, be exercised in assigning too rigid a time course to bruising in infants and young children based on a lack of a vital reaction, as the absence of leukocytes within soft tissues of bruised skin in these cases may not necessarily indicate that the injuries are recent. Variability in tissue response may also occur in different bruises in the same individual. Whether severe craniocerebral trauma played a role in delaying the cellular response in these particular injuries is unclear. Roger W. Byard, Regula Wick, John D. Gilbert and Terence Donal...|$|R
40|$|Since 2010, the University of Cádiz offers {{three new}} degree {{programs}} related to merchant marine officers studies. These three degrees cover {{the training and}} certification of deck officers, marine engineers and radio- electronic officers, clustered under the EINAMAR (Escuela de Ingeniería Marina,Naútica y Radioelectrónica) umbrella. These degrees are designed to provide the students {{not only with the}} proper academic certificate but also with a fully worldwide recognized professional certificate. This is the reason why the studies not only have to fully fulfill the academic quality requirements laid down by ANECA (Agencia Nacional de Evaluación de la Calidad y Acreditación) or DEVA (Dirección de Evaluación y Acreditación – Agencia Andaluza del Conocimiento-) but also with the standard qualifications set up by the International Convention on Standard of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping (STCW 95) for seafarers as amended in 2010 (Manila Amendments). According to this, as far as the students finish successfully their studies, and after an onboard training period, {{they will be able to}} obtain both, the academic and the professional certificates. “Maritime Safety” is a one of the core subjects for these three programs and it has been designed as a transversal subject in such a way that all the students have the same contents and schedule. This subject aims to provide the students with the theoretical and practical training to cope with any situation involving fire prevention and firefighting as well as incident and accident prevention and resolution on board. It also introduces student into the world of contingency planning and evacuation procedures on board, the knowledge of how to use <b>survival</b> crafts and <b>equipment</b> to increase probabilities of survival when abandoning the ship, and the most appropriate techniques and procedures when abandoning the ship and boarding the survival crafts. The main aim of the practical part of the subject is to improve the on board safety and risk awareness and to let the students get used to the most appropriate techniques and procedures as well as the use and maintenance of the protective equipment available on board. To achieve this goal, problem based learning techniques related to real situations on board have been applied. One of the specific practical workshop that have been implemented during the course, deals with the student training level in the use of SCBA (Self-contained reathing apparatus) and other protective equipment as well as orientation and search and rescue techniques within hostile environments with sensorial losses. As these situations can arise on board students must be familiar with them in order to properly face them. The aim of this specific workshop is not only to improve the students’ safety and risk awareness but also to encourage, strengthen and increase other professional and social skills...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Risk and Safety {{management}} 3. 1 A {{briefing on}} {{the objective of}} the work All year petroleum activity is not possible in the Barents Sea with regard to emergency preparedness unless sufficient attention is given to critical factors influencing evacuation and rescue. The objective of this thesis is to examine conditions relevant to evacuation and rescue of personnel from facilities operating in the Barents Sea. We are concerned with the boundary between situations that we can manage within emergency preparedness, procedures, technology and the situations where {{we may not be able}} to expect success. Certain situations may not be covered by emergency preparedness procedures due to conscious decisions that are made in the process of risk and emergency preparedness analysis, the selection of acceptance criteria and situations of hazard and accident. Limiting factors can be identified within the areas of human, technology, operational or organisational perspectives. Experts are normally aware of the limitations that are “designed into the system”. Limitations should be dealt with openly and honestly within a risk management regime. 3. 2 Information about the limitations of the report The report considers the Norwegian sector of the Barents Sea north of the Norwegian mainland, south of Bjørnøya and extending eastwards towards the Norwegian/Russian border that came into effect in 2011. This corresponds roughly to the area that is open for exploration and exploitation of petroleum resources in the Norwegian sector of the Barents Sea. 3. 3 A briefing of the methods that are used Emergency preparedness for the petroleum activity in the Barents Sea is examined based on: • Risk management theory: Risk Analysis, ALARP, Emergency Preparedness Analysis and Defined Situations of Hazard and Accident (DSHA). • Examination of literature pertaining to emergency preparedness and survival in cold climates and remote areas. • Performing analysis of barriers using event trees, bow ties and networks to identify critical issues related to successful emergency preparedness. • Examination of information gathered from relevant accident investigation reports related to maritime and aviation accidents. • Performing interviews to gather experience from operations in the Barents Sea and to triangulate the results of analysis and calculations. • Performing example calculations relevant to evacuation and rescue. 3. 4 The most important results Every effort should be made to prevent the need for emergency preparedness resources and if required, evacuation, <b>survival</b> and rescue <b>equipment</b> should perform satisfactorily in order to eliminate or reduce injury and loss of life. Weather conditions in the Barents Sea are such that certain critical technical solutions may not be appropriate in some circumstances. Immersions suits are critical to survival of persons in the sea and should be used with caution outside of the design envelope. Helicopters are equipped with floatation systems that may be insufficient in sea states that are currently accepted for transport flights. It can be difficult to rescue persons from lifeboats in harsh weather and this may pose an extra threat to survival if ice accretion threatens the stability of the vessels. The useful operational window of equipment and a person’s ability to use the equipment should be known and activities should be planned within this envelope. 3. 5 Major findings and conclusions The lack of infrastructure and long distances combined with the climatic conditions of the Barents Sea lead to challenges that require special consideration and management. Performance requirements related to medical evacuation of ill or injured persons will be challenged as activity moves further north and away from mainland Norway. Compensating measures will need to be implemented to ensure that the need for emergency preparedness resources is reduced at the same time as improving access to these resources as the need cannot be eliminated. As work has progressed on this thesis, it has become increasingly clear that it is insufficient to only consider the traditional regimes of emergency preparedness within the area of evacuation and rescue. In the case of an accident involving many injured persons, there is a challenge with regard to the capacity of the public health services in Northern Norway. This is further aggravated by large distances and limited resources for transportation. In order to prevent the loss of life, the availability of emergency health services onshore must be considered when evaluating the total acceptability of petroleum operations in the Barents Sea. Increased awareness of the physical and psychological limitations of a person and the limitations of evacuation, <b>survival</b> and rescue <b>equipment</b> is required combined with improved planning of activities based on this knowledge. Departure criteria for helicopter transport should be developed to ensure a reasonable prospect of rescue under the prevailing conditions during the flight. Ice accretion remains an issue that requires attention particularly for emergency response vessels, lifeboats, fast recovery daughter craft and man overboard boats. Emergency response vessels should be designed to retrieve lifeboats from the sea in a broad range of sea conditions and as far as reasonably practicable be able to perform this operation close to the limit of the conditions that can be anticipated. Improved access to medical assistance onboard the facility is required due to distance and unpredictable weather conditions. Improved health requirements and screening of personnel who will work on facilities in the Barents Sea is recommended. All year activity everywhere in the Barents Sea is only possible if comprehensive risk analysis is performed, the ALARP process applied and necessary measures are put in place to compensate for the specific challenges of the area. 3. 6 Recommendations for further work Research helicopter ditching and accidents in the sea to identify critical issues related to escape and survival in order to improve helicopter underwater escape training. Research voluntary safety training involving developing tolerance to cold water and dealing with a stressful environment during escape from a helicopter and subsequent survival in the sea. Evaluate the benefits compared to current helicopter underwater escape training. Develop a decision support tool based on a comprehensive set of departure criteria for helicopter flights. Develop a civilian helicopter in flight refuelling system (HIFR) suited for use in the Arctic. Develop suitable methods for evacuation in cold climates where sea conditions can vary from calm to violent storm or even hurricane in open water conditions to many varieties of ice types and cover.
