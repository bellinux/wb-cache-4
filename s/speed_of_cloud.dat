40|$|Industrial {{experts agree}} that cloud {{computing}} can significantly improve business and public access to low cost computing power and storage. Despite the benefits of cloud computing, recent research surveys indicated that its adoption in U. S. hospitals is slower than expected. The {{purpose of this study}} was to understand what factors influence cloud adoption in U. S. hospitals. The theoretical foundation of the research was the diffusion of innovations and technology-organization-environment framework. The research question was to examine the predictability of cloud computing adoption for U. S. hospitals as a function of 6 influential factors: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, organizational size, structure, and culture. The research methodology included a cross-sectional survey with an existing validated questionnaire. A stratified random sample of 118 information technology managers from qualified U. S. hospitals completed the questionnaire. The categorical regression analysis rendered F statistics and R 2 values to test the predictive models. The research results revealed that all 6 influential factors had significant correlations with the public cloud adoption intent (adjusted R 2 =. 583) while only the 3 technological factors had significant correlations with the private cloud adoption intent (adjusted R 2 =. 785). The recommendation is to include environmental factors and increase sample size in the similar future research. The developed predictive models provided a clearer understanding among hospital IT executives and cloud service providers of cloud adoption drivers. The potential implications for positive social change can be the increase of efficiency and effectiveness in U.

40|$|AbstractA primary task of {{the visual}} system is to extract the {{direction}} and <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> animate objects from the retinal image. We examined global speed processing by determining how local speeds are integrated and whether integration occurs across all speeds or within fixed speed ranges. The first experiment addressed how local motion signals are combined to determine the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> an object in motion. Observers judged the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> a moving <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> dots that took a random walk in direction while the dots inside the cloud moved somewhat independently <b>of</b> the <b>cloud</b> itself. The apparent <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cloud</b> <b>of</b> dots is found to change in proportion with the dot speed and is well predicted by calculating the average speed resulting from nearest neighbour matches across stimulus frames. The second experiment addressed whether local speeds are combined across all speeds or within fixed speed ranges {{for the detection of}} global motion. Global dot motion (GDM) stimuli that moved in a radial or rotational directions moving at a low <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> 1. 2 °/s or a high <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> 9. 6 °/s were used to measure the thresholds for detecting structured motion as a function <b>of</b> the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> noise dots (0 °/s– 10. 8 °/s) added to the stimulus. With low-speed targets, only additional noise dots moving at low speeds interfered with signal detection. High-speed targets were only interfered with by dots moving at high speeds. This finding established the existence of at least two independent speed tuned systems in the range <b>of</b> <b>speeds</b> tested. Experiment 3 investigated how speed signals are combined within a system to determine the global speed. Using sectored radial GDM stimuli the perceived <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the fastest dots was measured as a function <b>of</b> whether the <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the dots in alternate sectors either activated the high or low-speed systems. Averaging only occurred when dots were all within the sensitivity range of the high-speed system, however, if alternate sectors activated separate speed systems, averaging did not occur.

A Gaussian {{model for}} the {{distribution}} of swimming velocities of planktonic organisms predicts that if predator and prey have modal speeds v and u respectively, then their modal relative speed is simply V(u 2 + v 2).

The images show that the spatial brightness distribution <b>of</b> <b>cloud</b> features, in particular the bright bands at mid-southern latitudes and near 30 °N, changed considerably between 1989 (Voyager era) and 2001. The brightest features extend latitudinally over several degrees, and despite the different velocities in different latitude bands, these bright features remain coherent. We show that these features are bright {{in part because of}} the foreshortening effect near the limb, which suggests that the features may be composed <b>of</b> small bright <b>clouds</b> that happen to line up near the limb. At certain latitudes (mid-southern and northern latitudes), there is considerable dispersion in relative rotation periods (and hence zonal velocities) of faint and moderately bright features, while there is essentially no velocity dispersion of features at 50 °S. While the zonal <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> the brightest features are consistent with the Voyager-derived zonal-mean wind profile, there are many cloud features that do not appear to move with the flow. The data are further suggestive of oscillations in longitude, with periods > 4 hrs. We suggest that tidal forcing by Triton could play a role in exciting the waves responsible for the velocity variations of the observed period. Space EngineeringAerospace Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDifferent {{missions}} {{have observed}} mesospheric clouds on Mars {{in the last}} years. The presence <b>of</b> these <b>clouds</b> implies, among other conditions, mesospheric temperatures below CO 2 condensation temperature. We use a General Circulation Model to study the mesospheric temperatures and compare the observed distribution <b>of</b> the mesospheric <b>clouds</b> and the predicted climatology of mesospheric temperatures. Although the model does not usually predict temperatures below condensation for daytime conditions, in some regions the predicted temperatures are close enough to condensation that perturbations caused by small scale processes could produce local excursions below condensation. The location and time of the lowest temperatures predicted by the GCM correspond to a first order with the two observed populations of mesospheric clouds: equatorial clouds observed {{before and after the}} Northern summer solstice, and mid-latitude clouds observed around the Northern winter solstice. For the equatorial clouds season, the model predicts temperatures close to condensation at the longitude, latitude, altitude and local time where they have been observed. We find that the diurnal migrating thermal tide and non-migrating tides are {{at the root of the}} spatial confinement <b>of</b> the equatorial <b>clouds.</b> For the mid-latitude clouds season, the temperatures predicted by the model at the location <b>of</b> the observed <b>clouds</b> is too high. Stereo observations by two different instruments allow for the determination <b>of</b> the zonal <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> these <b>clouds</b> producing a rare dataset of mesospheric winds. We compare the mesospheric zonal winds predicted by the model with these observations, finding a good agreement, although in some cases the observed variability exceeds that predicted by the model...|$|R
