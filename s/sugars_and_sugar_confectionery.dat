40|$|It {{is renowned}} the {{importance}} of trade balance for maintaining macroeconomic equilibrium. So, {{the objective of the}} study was to identify main products in Brazilian agricultural exports from 1989 to 2012 and, secondly, to describe the identified products and formulate questions for future investigations. There is a trend for positive increasings in nominal level of agricultural exports. Substantive correlation between mean values and median values exported was also highlighted, something that can suggest the presence of products concentrating revenues. Moreover, increasing in mean values of agricultural exports was greater than increasing in mean values of global Brazilian exports, particularly from 2000. In terms of frequency in exported items, fruits and meat and edible meat offal must be cited. At second level in terms of frequency in export items there are animal and vegetable fats and oils, cocoa and cocoa preparations, preparations of vegetables and tobacco and manufactured tobacco. It is also remarkable specific codes of cocoa and cocoa preparations, <b>sugars</b> <b>and</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>confectionery,</b> and fruits, for example.

40|$|Significant {{volumes of}} mutual {{trade between the}} {{countries}} of the Eurasian Economic Union, combined with the urgency of protecting the population against the risks of negative impacts on the health products are aiming to optimize the supervision of the products traded in the market. One of the ways to optimize is the transition to a risk-based model of health service activities and choice of products for top-priority (priority) control. The approaches to the selection of priorities are offered, based on the account of the product use, consumer contingent specificity, known types of hazards, results of inspection and enforcement activities. It was found that the priority products exported by EASE member countries on the common market and forming potentially the greatest risk of harm to the health of consumers may include: dairy products; bird eggs (FEACN group 04); fats and oils of animal or vegetable origin and their cleavage products; prepared edible fats; waxes of animal or vegetable origin (FEACN group 15); <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>confectionery</b> (FEACN group 17); meat, fish or crustaceans, mollusks or other aquatic invertebrates (FEACN group 16); alcoholic and soft drinks and so on.

40|$|<b>Sugars</b> <b>and</b> <b>sugar</b> polyols are {{relatively}} abundant groups of water-soluble constituents in atmospheric aerosols. This paper describes {{a method that}} uses liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to analyze <b>sugars</b> <b>and</b> <b>sugar</b> polyols in atmospheric aerosols, ranging from C- 3 sugar alcohols to trisaccharides. Postcolumn addition of chloroform in acetonitrile was found to greatly enhance ionization of these compounds by forming chloride adduct ions in the negative-ion mode using electrospray ionization. A gradient elution program starting at 5 %: 95 % H 2 O/acetonitrile and ending at 30 %: 70 % H 2 O/acetonitrile provides baseline separations of the <b>sugars</b> <b>and</b> <b>sugar</b> polyols on an amino-based carbohydrate column. The detection limits based on quantification of [M + Cl- 35](-) adduct ions {{were in the order}} of 0. 1 mu M. By eliminating the need for derivatization, this LC-MS based method provides a simpler alternative method to the commonly used and more laborious gas-chromatography based methods. It also has an additional advantage of being able to quantify trisaccharide sugars. The method was applied to analyze 30 ambient samples of fine particulate matter collected at a site away from urban centers in Hong Kong. The <b>sugar</b> compounds positively identified <b>and</b> detected in the ambient samples included four sugar alcohols (glycerol, erythritol, xylitol, <b>and</b> mannitol), three monosacchride <b>sugars</b> (xylose, fructose, <b>and</b> glucose), two disaccharides (sucrose, trehalose), two trisaccharides (melezitose, raffinose), and one anhydrosugar (levoglucosan). The sum of these <b>sugar</b> <b>and</b> <b>sugar</b> polyol compounds ranged from 38 to 1316 ng m(- 3), accounting for an average of 1. 3 % organic carbon mass. Through the use of a principal component analysis of the ambient measurements, the mono- to trisaccharide <b>sugars</b> <b>and</b> C- 3 -C- 5 sugar polyols were identified to be mainly associated with soil/soil microbiota while the anhydrosugar (levoglucosan) was associated with biomass burning...|$|R
