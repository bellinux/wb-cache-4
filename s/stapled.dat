5|$|More than 930,000policyholders in South Florida lost {{coverage}} after 11insurance companies went bankrupt, {{caused by}} more than 600,000insurance claims filed. This led the Florida Legislature to create new entities, such as the Joint Underwriting Association, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association, and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, {{in an effort to}} restore adequate insurance capacity. Stricter building codes were created in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. A survey by Tim Marshall and Richard Herzog of the Haag Engineer Company in Carrollton, Texas, highlighted several construction issues. On the roof of some homes, the concrete tiles were glued to felt paper, which could easily be ripped by straight line winds. At houses with shingled roofs, it was found that some of the shingles were <b>stapled</b> perpendicular to the long axis, also allowing them to be torn away. After the tiles or shingles were peeled off, the plywood and prefabricated trusses were exposed to the weather. Eventually, the plywood and the trusses suffered structural failure, leading to roof collapses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Bone <b>staples</b> are an {{accepted}} method of fixation in foot surgery. They reduce operating time and trauma in surgical procedures. A variety of memory <b>staples</b> are available but their properties compared to standard <b>staples</b> are not known. We {{carried out a}} study comparing two popular types of memory <b>staples</b> and a standard stainless steel <b>staple.</b> Methods Standardized bone models of metatarsals made from Tufnol tubes were osteotomized and stabilised using one of three types of bone <b>staples,</b> two types of memory <b>staple</b> (Memory <b>staple</b> and heat-activated Memoclip) or a standard stainless steel <b>staple</b> (Richards). Constructs were loaded in bending and torsion on a material testing machine. The moment and torque to achieve 10 degree of bending or torsion and permanent angulation of the osteotomized bones were assessed. Results The Richards <b>staple</b> was found to provide a four times larger resistance to bending and torsion than the two memory <b>staples.</b> However, it was permanently deformed after bending. The Memory and Memoclip <b>staples</b> were equal in their stiffness. In addition, angulation of bones fixed with the Memoclip was elastic, preventing any permanent deformation. Conclusion The Richards <b>staple</b> was stiffer, although the permanent deformation of this <b>staple</b> is a disadvantage. Memoclip <b>staples</b> exhibit lower but adequate stiffnesss {{when compared to the}} standard Richards <b>staple</b> and are not permanently deformed after bending. The Memoclip <b>staples</b> were easier to handle. The results will enable surgeons to determine the optimal <b>staple</b> for foot and ankle procedures. </p...|$|R

Each of the six fresh specimens was divided into three conditions: normal, single <b>staple,</b> and double <b>staples.</b> Under each condition, the angle and torque of spinal movements in six directions were tested. Results show that the differences in recovery stress and maximum pullout strength between groups were statistically significant.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 56 - 62) Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is {{a complex}} three-dimensional deformity of the spine where there is increased loading on the concave side. Fusionless spinal growth modulation strategies such as intervertebral <b>stapling</b> attempt to reverse the imbalance of forces while limiting curve progression and preserving spinal motion. The objective {{of this study was}} to characterize the thermo-mechanical behavior of nitinol <b>staples,</b> a shape-memory alloy currently utilized in medical <b>staples,</b> to evaluate the force generated by the <b>staples</b> on the vertebrae, and to measure the forces on implanted <b>staples</b> in motions in an ex vivo and in vitro set up on immature porcine model. A total of three separate experiments were conducted to characterize the behavior of the <b>staple</b> in the study. First, the effect of temperature (heating) on <b>staple</b> force was investigated using a strain gauge attached to the surface of the <b>staple</b> to record changes in strain as the <b>staple</b> was heated. Nitinol is a unique material in that it exhibits both shape-memory and superelasticity characteristics which allows factors such as temperature and stress to affect its mechanical properties. The second experiment investigated the mechanical characteristics of nitinol through temperature-controlled, ex vivo mechanical testing of the <b>staple.</b> Strain-gauge instrumented <b>staples</b> were mounted in a servo-hydraulic testing apparatus and subjected to a constant load as strain was recorded. Lastly, the force generated by the <b>staples</b> due to the shape-memory effect was measured. Two <b>staples</b> were first stretched to different initial displacement lengths and then heated while the subsequent compression force generated was measured. In addition to these ex vivo experiments, <b>staples</b> were instrumented into post-mortem porcine spine specimens and subjected to in situ testing with spinal motions in an in vitro setting. The forces on the <b>staple</b> were measured during these tests and the effect of <b>stapling</b> on spinal biomechanics was assessed. A notable change in strain on the <b>staple</b> was found at 30 ??C, which is below the critical threshold of 37 ??C (body-temperature), indicating that the <b>staple</b> will exhibit the proper shape-memory effect characteristics vital to its use in the body. In the study where the force generated by the <b>staple</b> was measured, the average peak force was found to be 24. 7 N, correlating to 5 - 15 % of body weight for a growing adolescent. For testing in porcine spines, a significantly lower force obtained from the strain gauge was seen in lateral bending towards the <b>staple</b> (0. 46 N/deg) compared to away from the <b>staples</b> (3. 43 N/deg). In flexion (2. 44 N/deg) and extension (2. 92 N/deg), similar forces were observed, with little difference in force noted in axial rotation towards (0. 50 N/deg) and away from the implanted <b>staples</b> (0. 48 N/deg). These results suggest that intervertebral <b>stapling</b> might be able to significantly alter the biomechanics of the spine as evidenced by the level of force generated by the <b>staple</b> when measured ex vivo as well as the smaller <b>staple</b> force observed in motions directed towards the implanted <b>staple...</b>|$|R
