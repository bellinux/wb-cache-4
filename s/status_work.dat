40|$|Objectives. To {{examine the}} mutual {{influences}} between changes in <b>work</b> <b>status</b> and multiple dimensions of health outcomes (immediate memory, physical disability, and depressive symptoms) over later years. Methods. We used a subsample of 8, 524 older adults {{who participated in}} the Health and Retirement Study from 1998 to 2008 and were 62  years or older in 1998 to examine <b>work</b> <b>status</b> and health outcomes after controlling for age and background characteristics. Results. We present results of cross-lagged auto-regressive models. <b>Work</b> <b>status</b> (level of <b>work)</b> predicted subsequent residual changes in immediate memory over time, whereas immediate memory predicted subsequent residual changes in <b>work</b> <b>status</b> over time, even after controlling for physical disability and depressive symptoms. Similar results were indicated for the associations between <b>work</b> <b>status</b> and physical disability and depressive symptoms over time. Discussion. Consistent with social causation and social selection traditions, the findings support bi-directional asso-ciations among changes in <b>work</b> <b>status</b> (the level of work), immediate memory, physical disability, and depressive symp-toms in later years. Practical implications are discussed. Key Words: Depressive symptoms—Memory—Physical disability—Retirement—Work.

40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} whether <b>work</b> <b>status</b> is the only basis for {{determining}} the provision of disability pensions in cases of mental illness, and considers the validity of this criterion and {{ways to improve the}} system. We collected 178 decisions of the Examination Committee of Social Insurance due to "Mental Illness" over a period of 11 years (1994 to 2004), and investigated the relationships among three factors : activity of daily living (ADL), <b>work</b> <b>status,</b> and pension benefits. We also examined the 21 working subjects separately. We found a significant relationship between ADL and pension benefits and between <b>work</b> <b>status</b> and pension benefits. No significant relationship was found between ADL and <b>work</b> <b>status.</b> In 6 of the 21 working subjects, the disability pension decision was made solely by focusing on <b>work</b> <b>status.</b> Despite this focus on <b>work</b> <b>status,</b> the working disabled cannot always compensate for their reduced income and the extraordinary expenditure incurred due to their disability. Further, because these decisions can go against the trend of encouraging the disabled to work, we suggest that it is not appropriate to focus solely on <b>work</b> <b>status</b> in determining pension benefits and propose ways to improve the system...|$|R

Background : The Fulfillness of {{nutrition}} workers during work {{is part of}} an effort to improve the degree of health workers. A good nutritional status has an important role in reducing fatigue and increasing productivity. This research aimed to determine the correlation {{of nutrition}}al <b>status</b> with fatigue <b>work</b> and work productivity. Methods: This research was an analytic survey,with cross sectional design. The sampling technique used was simple random sampling. Population were part sewing workers with female sex numbered 43 people. This research used weight scaled and height meter to measure nutritional status, reaction timer to measure fatigue work and worksheets for work productivity. Data analysis technique used statistical test Gamma Correlation. Results : The correlation of nutritional <b>status</b> with fatigue <b>work</b> in sewing workers in the convection X showed significant results, that was based on body mass index with fatigue showed p-value = 0. 020, based on waist circumference with fatigue showed p-value = 0. 003, and based on waist hip ratio with fatigue work showed p-value = 0. 020.
