5|$|Studies {{conducted}} off the Florida {{coast and}} the Bahamas {{have shown that}} <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> are highly sensitive to sound, in particular low-frequency (10–20Hz), irregular pulses. Experiments in which these sounds were played underwater attracted sharks from hundreds of meters away. <b>Silky</b> <b>sharks</b> likely orient to these sounds because they {{are similar to the}} noise generated by feeding animals such as birds or dolphins, thus indicating promising sources of food. These studies have also demonstrated that a silky shark attracted by one sound will quickly withdraw if that sound abruptly changes in amplitude or character; this change need not be a sound produced by a predator to evoke the reaction. Over repeated exposures, <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> habituate to the sound change and stop withdrawing, though it takes them much longer to do so compared to the bolder oceanic whitetip shark.|$|E
5|$|Large {{numbers of}} <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> are caught by {{commercial}} and artisanal multispecies shark fisheries operating off Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, the United States, Ecuador, Spain, Portugal, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Yemen, and Côte d'Ivoire. Even greater numbers are caught incidentally by tuna longline and purse seine fisheries throughout its range, particularly those using fish aggregating devices. It {{is the most}} common shark caught as bycatch in the eastern Pacific and Gulf of Mexico tuna fisheries, and the second-most common shark caught as bycatch (next to the blue shark) overall. The fins are valued as an ingredient in shark fin soup, with captured sharks often finned at sea {{and the rest of the}} body discarded. Fins from an estimated one-half to one and a half million <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> are traded globally per year; it is the second- or third-most common species auctioned on the Hong Kong fin market, which represents over half the global trade. The meat (sold fresh or dried and salted), skin, and liver oil may also be used, as well as the jaws: this species is the predominant source of dried shark jaw curios sold to tourists in the tropics. Some sport fishers catch <b>silky</b> <b>sharks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sharks can {{be highly}} social, {{remaining}} in large schools. Sometimes more than 100 scalloped hammerheads congregate around seamounts and islands, e.g., in the Gulf of California. Cross-species social hierarchies exist. For example, oceanic whitetip sharks dominate <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> of comparable size during feeding.|$|E

5|$|On the {{infrequent}} {{occasions when}} they swim in oceanic waters, grey reef sharks often associate with marine mammals or large pelagic fishes, such as sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus). There is {{an account of}} around 25 grey reef sharks following a large pod of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.), along with 25 <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> (C. falciformis) and a single silvertip shark. Rainbow runners (Elagatis bipinnulata) have been observed rubbing against grey reef sharks, using the sharks' rough skin to scrape off parasites.|$|E
5|$|A {{scientific}} {{description of}} the silky shark was first published by the German biologists Johannes Müller and Jakob Henle under the name Carcharias (Prionodon) falciformis, in their 1839 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen. Subsequent authors have assigned this species to the genus Carcharhinus. Because Müller and Henle's type specimen was a 53-cm-long female fetus from Cuba, adult <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> were historically not recognized as C.falciformis and were described as a separate species, Carcharhinus floridanus, by Henry Bigelow, William Schroeder, and Stewart Springer in 1943. Jack Garrick, Richard Backus, and Robert Gibbs, Jr. synonymized C.floridanus with C.falciformis in 1964.|$|E
5|$|Three {{types of}} habitats, mangroves, reefs and seagrasses, {{are found in}} Puerto Rico's ocean waters. A total of 677 fish species live in these habitats; 242 being reef species. Fish species found in Puerto Rican reefs are {{representative}} of the general Caribbean fauna. Common reef fishes include wrasses, damselfishes, white grunts (Haemulon plumieri), bluestriped grunts (Haemulon sciurus), queen parrotfish (Scarus vetula), and sharks (family Carcharhinidae). Sea breams (Archosargus rhomboidalis) and yellowfin mojarras (Gerres cinereus) are some of the species commonly found in mangrove habitats. Other species of interest include flatfishes, with 21 recorded species, and sharks, with more than 20 species. Oceanic whitetip sharks and <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> are common in the Mona Passage.|$|E

5|$|Given its {{formidable}} {{size and}} dentition, the <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> {{is regarded as}} potentially dangerous to humans. However, it only rarely comes into contact with people due to its oceanic habits. Its natural curiosity and boldness may lead it to repeatedly and closely approach divers, and it can become dangerously excited {{in the presence of}} food. The <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> tends to be more aggressive if encountered on a reef than in open water. Cases of individual sharks persistently harassing divers and even forcing them out of the water have been reported. As of May 2009, the International Shark Attack File lists six attacks attributable to the <b>silky</b> <b>shark,</b> three of them unprovoked and none fatal.|$|R

5|$|The {{large size}} and cutting {{teeth of the}} silky shark make it {{potentially}} dangerous, and it has behaved aggressively towards divers. However, attacks are rare, as few humans enter its oceanic habitat. <b>Silky</b> <b>sharks</b> are valued for their fins, {{and to a lesser}} extent their meat, hide, liver oil, and jaws. Because of their abundance, they form a major component of commercial and artisanal shark fisheries in many countries. Furthermore, their association with tuna results in many sharks being taken as bycatch in tuna fisheries. Although slow-reproducing like most other sharks, the wide distribution and large population size of the silky shark was once thought to buffer the species against these fishing pressures. However, data now suggest that silky shark numbers are declining around the world, which prompted the IUCN to reassess its conservation status from Least Concern to Near Threatened in 2007.|$|E
500|$|Potential predators of {{the silky}} shark include larger sharks and killer whales (Orcinus orca). Known parasites of this shark include the isopod Gnathia trimaculata, the copepod Kroeyerina cortezensis, and the {{tapeworms}} Dasyrhynchus variouncinatus and Phyllobothrium sp. <b>Silky</b> <b>sharks</b> frequently intermingle with schools of scalloped hammerheads (Sphyrna lewini), {{and have been}} known to follow marine mammals. One account from the Red Sea describes 25silky sharks following a large pod of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.), along with 25grey reef sharks (C.amblyrhynchos) and a lone silvertip shark (C.albimarginatus). <b>Silky</b> <b>sharks</b> are themselves accompanied by juvenile pilot fish (Naucrates ductor), which [...] "ride" [...] the pressure wave ahead of the shark, as well as by jacks, which snatch scraps of food and rub against the shark's skin to scrape off parasites.|$|E
500|$|The {{silky shark}} is an {{opportunistic}} predator, feeding mainly on bony fishes from {{all levels of}} the water column, including tuna, mackerel, sardines, mullets, groupers, snappers, mackerel scads, sea chubs, sea catfish, eels, lanternfishes, filefishes, triggerfishes, and porcupinefishes. It may also take squid, paper nautilus, and swimming crabs, and fossil evidence indicates it scavenged on whale carcasses. Good feeding opportunities can draw <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> in large numbers; one such feeding aggregation in the Pacific has been documented [...] "herding" [...] a school of small fishes into a compact mass (a bait ball) and trapping it against the surface, whereupon the sharks consumed the entire school. When attacking tightly packed fish, <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> charge through the ball and slash open-mouthed, catching the prey fish at the corners of their jaws. Although multiple individuals may feed at once, each launches its attack independently.|$|E

500|$|Younger <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> {{are known}} to form large, loosely {{organized}} aggregations, possibly for mutual defense. During migrations, over a thousand individuals may gather. These groups are generally segregated by size, and in the Pacific perhaps also by sex. <b>Silky</b> <b>sharks</b> within a group have been observed to [...] "tilt", presenting their full lateral profile towards each other, as well as gape their jaws or puff out their gills. On occasion, sharks have also been seen suddenly charging straight up, veering away just before reaching the surface and gliding back down to deeper water. The significance of these behaviors is unknown. When confronted, the silky shark may perform a threat display, in which it arches its back, drops its tail and pectoral fins, and elevates its head. The shark then proceeds to swim in tight loops with a stiff, jerky motion, often turning broadside towards the perceived threat.|$|E
500|$|The {{bite force}} of a 2-m-long silky shark has been {{measured}} at [...] A well-established association exists between this species and tuna: off Ghana, almost every tuna school has <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> trailing behind, and in the eastern Pacific, these sharks inflict such damage to tuna fishing gear and catches that fishery workers have given them the moniker [...] "net-eating sharks". <b>Silky</b> <b>sharks</b> and bottlenose dolphins compete when both species target the same school of fish; the amount eaten by the dolphins decreases relative {{to the number of}} sharks present. If a large number of sharks is present, they tend to remain inside the prey school, while the dolphins consign themselves to the periphery, possibly to avoid incidental injury from the sharks' slashing attacks. Conversely, if a large enough group of dolphins gathers, they become able to chase the sharks away from the prey school. Regardless of which one dominates, the two predators do not engage in any overtly aggressive behavior against each other.|$|E
500|$|Primarily an {{inhabitant}} of {{the open}} ocean, the silky shark is most common from the surface {{to a depth of}} , but may dive to [...] or more.

In the Pacific Ocean and possibly elsewhere, it spends the summer at slightly higher latitudes, particularly during warmer El Niño years. In the northern Atlantic, most sharks follow the Gulf Stream northward along the U.S. East Coast. In the Gulf of Aden, it is most common in late spring and summer.|$|E
500|$|In {{light of}} recent findings, in 2007, the IUCN reassessed the <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> from Least Concern to Near Threatened worldwide. Regionally, it {{is listed as}} Near Threatened in the southwestern Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and western central Pacific, and as Vulnerable in the eastern central and southeastern Pacific and the northwestern and western central Atlantic. The <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> is listed on Annex I, Highly Migratory Species, of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, though this has yet to result in any {{management}} schemes. The species should benefit from bans on shark finning, which are being increasingly implemented by nations and supranational entities, including the United States, Australia, and the European Union. Organizations such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas [...] and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission [...] have also taken steps to improve fishery monitoring, with {{the ultimate goal of}} reducing shark bycatch. However, given the highly migratory nature of the <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> and its association with tuna, no simple way is known to reduce bycatch without also affecting the economics of the fishery.|$|R
5|$|More recently, Gavin Naylor's 1992 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} {{allozyme}} sequence data, {{found that the}} <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> {{is part of a}} group containing large sharks with a ridge between the dorsal fins.

Mine Dosay-Abkulut's 2008 ribosomal DNA analysis, which included the silky, blue, and bignose sharks, confirmed the closeness of those three species.|$|R
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> is viviparous: once the {{developing}} embryo exhausts its supply of yolk, the depleted yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Relative to other viviparous sharks, the placenta of the <b>silky</b> <b>shark</b> is less similar to the analogous mammalian structure in that no interdigitation exists between the tissues of the fetus and mother. Furthermore, the fetal red blood cells are much smaller than maternal blood cells, which is opposite the pattern seen in mammals. Adult females have a single functional ovary (on the right side) and two functional uteri, which are divided lengthwise into separate compartments for each embryo.|$|R
500|$|The oceanic whitetip {{is usually}} solitary and slow-moving, {{and tends to}} cruise {{near the top of}} the water column, {{covering}} vast stretches of empty water scanning for possible food sources. Until the 16th century, sharks were known to mariners as [...] "sea dogs" [...] and the oceanic whitetip, the most common ship-following shark, exhibits dog-like behaviour when its interest is piqued: when attracted to something that appears to be food, its movements become more avid and it approaches cautiously but stubbornly, retreating and maintaining a safe distance if driven off, but ready to rush in if the opportunity presents itself. Oceanic whitetips are not fast swimmers, but they are capable of surprising bursts of speed. Whitetips commonly compete for food with <b>silky</b> <b>sharks,</b> making up for its comparatively leisurely swimming style with aggressive displays.|$|E
500|$|The {{silky shark}} has a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution {{in marine waters}} warmer than [...] In the Atlantic Ocean, it is found from the U.S. state of Massachusetts to Spain in the north, and from southern Brazil to northern Angola in the south, including the Mediterranean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea. It occurs throughout the Indian Ocean, {{as far south as}} Mozambique in the west and Western Australia in the east, including the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. In the Pacific Ocean, the northern extent of its range runs from southern China and Japan to southern Baja California and the Gulf of California, while the southern extent runs from Sydney, Australia, to northern New Zealand to northern Chile. Based on life history differences, four distinct populations of <b>silky</b> <b>sharks</b> have been identified in ocean basins worldwide: in the northwestern Atlantic, in the western and central Pacific, in the eastern Pacific, and in the Indian Ocean.|$|E
500|$|<b>Silky</b> <b>sharks</b> in {{most parts}} of the world are thought to {{reproduce}} year-round, whereas mating and birthing in the Gulf of Mexico take place in late spring or early summer (May to August). However, in some cases, the presence of reproductive seasonality may have been obscured by biases in data collection. Females give birth after a gestation period of 12months, either every year or every other year. The litter size ranges from oneto16 and increases with female size, with six to 12 being typical. The pups are born in reef nursery areas on the outer continental shelf, where ample food supplies and protection from large pelagic sharks occur. The risk of predation has selected for fast growth in young sharks, which add [...] to their length within their first year of life. After a few months (or by the first winter in the Gulf of Mexico), the now-subadult sharks migrate out from the nursery into the open ocean.|$|E
