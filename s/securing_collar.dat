5000|$|Maria (15 September 1869 - 3 May 1934), {{often called}} Mia, was the Olsson's second daughter. She {{was born in}} Lindsborg, Kansas. During a family trip to Europe in 1889, Mia and her younger sister Lydia took lessons in [...] "fancy work." [...] Mia would later use these {{dressmaking}} skills to patent the [...] "Combination Collar Fastener." [...] This fastener was used to <b>secure</b> <b>collars</b> or belts, and predated the first patented zipper. Like her siblings, Mia attended Augustana College. She enrolled in the Conservatory of Music in 1895, studying piano. A year later, she enrolled in Elocution and Physical Culture. Mia was also involved in several campus choral groups. Mia died on 3 May 1934, and {{was buried in the}} family plot in Riverside Cemetery in Moline, Illinois.|$|R
50|$|Barbells {{range in}} length from 4 ft to above 8 ft, {{although}} bars longer than 2.2 m are used primarily by powerlifters {{and are not}} commonplace. The central portion of the bar varies in diameter from 25 mm to 2 in (e.g. Apollon's Axle), and is often engraved with a knurled crosshatch pattern to help lifters maintain a solid grip. Weight plates are slid onto the outer portions of the bar to increase or decrease the desired total weight. These weights are often <b>secured</b> with <b>collars</b> {{to prevent them from}} sliding off during the exercise, which can result in injuries and death, or flinging the unevenly loaded barbell through the air.|$|R

50|$|In Delaware, {{dogs are}} not allowed to run at large unless in {{situations}} when the owner is present and has control over the pet. An exception is for farm dogs. Also, during the night dogs must be kept in an enclosure from which they cannot escape, firmly <b>secured</b> with a <b>collar</b> or chain or other device, so they cannot stray from the premises, or are under the reasonable control of the owner or custodian. If an owner does not respect these laws and if the dog bites someone, the owner is subject to civil liability and for fines of up to $1,500.|$|R
60|$|He peeped {{with equal}} earnestness at the socks and the shirts of the {{traveling}} men. Socks {{had been to}} him not {{an article of faith}} but a detail of economy. His attitude to socks had lacked in reverence and technique. He had not perceived that socks may be as sound a symbol of culture as the 'cello or even demountable rims. He had been able to think with respect of ties and damp piqué <b>collars</b> <b>secured</b> by gold safety-pins; and to the belted fawn overcoat that the St. Klopstock banker's son had brought back from St. Paul, he had given jealous attention. But now he graduated into differential socks.|$|R
40|$|A {{metallic}} threaded composite fastener, particularly {{suited for}} high temperature applications, has a body member made of {{high temperature resistant}} composite material with a ceramic coating. The body member has a head portion configured to be installed in a countersunk hole and a shank portion which is noncircular and tapered. One part of the shank may be noncircular and the other part tapered, or {{the two types of}} surface could be combined into a frustum of a noncircular cone. A split collar member made of high strength, high temperature tolerant metal alloy is split into two halves and the interior of the halves are configured to engage the shank. The exterior of the collar has a circumferential groove which receives a lock ring to <b>secure</b> the <b>collar</b> halves to the shank. In the assembled condition torque may be transmitted from the body to the split collar by the engaged noncircular portions to install and remove the fastener assembly into or from a threaded aperture and shear loads in the collar threads are transferred to the shank tapered portion as a combination of radial compression and axial tension loads. Thus, tension loads may be applied to the fastener shank without damaging the ceramic coating...|$|R
500|$|In the 2000s, Dan Antoniu {{and other}} Romanian {{aviation}} experts investigated existing {{photographs of the}} Coandă-1910, leading them {{to believe that the}} aircraft presented at the exhibition was not finished, that it was exhibited with many improvisations. Antoniu published Henri Coandă and his technical work during 1906–1918, a 2010 book in which he said that the unfinished state of the aircraft led to Coandă filing several extra patents and starting a new series of studies with the aim of making the machine airworthy. For instance, Antoniu wrote that the exhaust pipes of the Clergét engine appeared free; there were no devices to redirect exhaust gases to the turbine as described in the patent, and there were no heat shields for crew protection. As well, the central attachment of the tubular struts holding the wings to the fuselage, with mere <b>collars</b> <b>secured</b> with screws, was judged by Antoniu as appearing potentially unsafe during take-off or landing because of the [...] "considerable loads on the struts". The X-shaped empennage was covered at high angles by the horizontal stabiliser making it unusable, and any high-speed taxi would put the machine in danger of a nose-over.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{emergency}} physicians face significant clinical uncertainty when {{multiple trauma}} patients {{arrive in the}} emergency department (ED). The priorities for assessment and treatment of polytrauma patients are established in the primary survey. Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) is very essential clinical skill during trauma resuscitation. Use of point of care ultrasound among the trauma team working in the primary survey in emergency care settings is lacking in Suez Canal University Hospitals even ultrasound machine not available in ED. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of FAST in hemodynamically unstable polytraumatized patients and to determine its role {{as an indication of}} laparotomy. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional study included 150 polytrauma patients with a blunt mechanism admitted in Suez Canal University Hospital. Firstly primary survey by airway check, cervical spine <b>securing</b> with neck <b>collar,</b> maintenance of breathing/circulation and management of life threading conditions if present were conducted accordingly to ATLS (advanced trauma life support) guidelines. The patients were assessed in the primary survey using the FAST as a tool to determine the presence of intra-abdominal collection. Results: A total of 150 patients, and FAST scans were performed in all cases. The sensitivity and specificity were 92. 6 % and 100 %, respectively. The negative predictive value was 92 %, while the positive predictive value of FAST was 100 %. The accuracy of FAST was 96 %. Conclusion: FAST is an important method to detect intra-abdominal fluid in the initial assessment in hemodynamically unstable polytrauma patients with high accuracy...|$|R
40|$|Transient lower {{oesophageal}} sphincter (LOS) relaxation is {{the major}} mechanism of gastro-oesophageal reflux in humans [...] an event unassociated with swallowing. Mechanisms involved in triggering transient LOS relaxation are poorly understood, and their further study requires a small animal model. In this study we aimed to establish methods for prolonged ambulant oesophageal manometry in ferrets, and to determine motor events associated with reflux episodes and their triggering by different gastric nutrient loads. Forty-two studies were performed on nine ferrets with chronic cervical oesophagostomies, through which a manometric assembly was introduced and <b>secured</b> to a <b>collar,</b> which incorporated a microphone for detection of swallows. The assembly included a gastric feeding channel, one gastric and four oesophageal manometric sideholes, a 2. 5 -cm-long LOS sleeve sensor, and an oesophageal pH electrode. Intragastric infusions were given over 2 min, the first after a 30 -min control recording period, and in 29 / 42 studies, a second infusion was given 60 min later. Infusions were either 25 mL 10 % dextrose solution, pH 3. 5 (22 studies), 25 mL triglyceride emulsion (Intralipid) pH 3. 5 (11 studies), or 25 mL air (nine studies). Episodes of oesophageal acidification were absent before gastric infusions. After infusion, 2. 1 +/- 0. 2 episodes occurred over the first 30 min. After glucose infusion, 15 / 18 acidification episodes (83 %) occurred during transient LOS relaxation, and 3 / 18 (17 %) occurred after gradual (< 1 mmHg sec- 1) downward drifts in basal LOSP to < 2 mmHg. After lipid infusion two acidification episodes occurred, both during transient LOS relaxation. Mean duration of transient LOS relaxation was 8. 0 +/- 0. 4 sec. All infusions increased occurrence of transient LOS relaxation to a similar extent, each of which ended with primary peristalsis. We conclude that gastric infusion of glucose, lipid and gas are all effective in provoking gastro-oesophageal reflux in ferrets. Reflux occurs through similar mechanisms to those seen in humans, i. e. increased triggering of transient LOS relaxation. The conscious ferret is therefore an appropriate model for future studies of manipulation of mechanisms giving rise to gastro-oesophageal reflux...|$|R
