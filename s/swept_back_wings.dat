50|$|After the disappointing {{performance}} of his D.I through D.IV, Fokker resolved to produce a smaller, lighter rotary-powered design. The new prototype, designated M.21, was a development of the earlier M.17 fighter which Fokker had produced for the Austro-Hungarian Air Service. The M.21 featured a <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> upper <b>wing</b> to improve pilot view.|$|R
50|$|Since {{considerable}} {{work had}} already been done on the P.1101 design, the RLM decided to continue reduced funding in order for Messerschmitt to carry out experimental flights, testing the <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> <b>wing</b> at anticipated speeds up to Mach 1. The worsening war situation led to the expedited, but risky, approach of building a full-scale prototype in parallel with detail construction and continuing statistical calculation, while existing components such as the wings (Me 262), landing gear (extended Bf 109), and flight components were utilized where feasible. It was also intended for the test flights to be conducted with 35, 40, and 45 degree wing sweep. Production of the V1 prototype was begun at Messerschmitt's Bavarian Oberammergau Complex with a projected first flight in June 1945.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} {{have been made}} of the now characteristics on wings of moderate sweepback. This note presents the results of the experimental investigation into the pressure distribution over a <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> <b>wing,</b> having an aspect ratio 4. 5 and sweep back angle 40 ° at quarter chord. A half model technique has been used. The wing section was R. A. E. 101 (symmetrical) with 6 % maximum thickness and zero camber. Measurements of chordwise pressure distributions at a number of spanwise sections were made in the incidence range 2 - 32 °. The experiments were performed at Reynolds numbers of 0. 9 x 10 (6) and 2 x 10 (6) (based on geometric mean chord). From these measurements, lift, drag and pitching moment characteristics of the wing were calculated...|$|R
50|$|However, this {{arrangement}} also has serious stability problems. The rearmost {{section of the}} wing will stall first causing a pitch-up moment pushing the aircraft further into stall similar to a swept back wing design. Thus swept-forward wings are unstable in a fashion similar to the low-speed problems of a conventional swept wing. However unlike <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> <b>wings,</b> the tips on a forward swept design will stall last, maintaining roll control.|$|E
50|$|The A4b {{concept was}} tested by fitting <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> <b>wings</b> to two A4s {{launched}} from Blizna. Little development {{work had been}} carried out and the first launch on 27 December 1944 was a complete failure. The second launch attempt, on 24 January 1945, was partially successful, in that the wing broke off, but the A4b still managed {{to become the first}} winged guided missile to break the sound barrier and attain Mach number 4.|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} for {{the determination of}} the stresses and deflections of unswept and swept, thin-walled beams of uniform closed cross section. The cross section, loading distribution and boundary conditions are assumed to be arbitrary. The method is based on the differential equation governing the behavior of orthogonal elastic shells. The differential equation is transformed into a difference equation and the solution obtained by the relaxation technique. A comparison of the theoretical solution and experimental data for a <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> <b>wing</b> with a carry through bay under symmetrical bending showed good agreement. A tapered wing may be treated by approximating the variation by a series of spanwise steps. As the difference equations are a system of simultaneous algebraic equations, they may be solved by automatic calculating equipment or by electric analogue computers {{as well as by the}} relaxation technique...|$|R
40|$|A static {{aeroelastic}} analysis capability {{that can}} predict aerodynamic loads for the deformed {{shape of the}} composite wing has been developed. The finite element method (FEM) was used for composite plate structural analysis, and the linear vortex lattice method (VLM) was used for steady aerodynamic analysis. The final deformed shape of the wing due to applied forces is determined by iterative manner using FEM and VLM. FEM and VLM analysis are related by a surface spline interpolation procedure. The wing with Gr/Ep composite material has been investigated to see the wing deformation effect. Aerodynamic load change due to wing flexibility has been investigated. Also, the effect of fiber orientation and sweep angle on the deformation pattern and aerodynamic coefficients are examined. For a certain fiber orientation, the deflection and aerodynamic loading of the composite wing is very much reduced. The swept forward wing has more significant effect of wing flexibility on aerodynamic coefficient than the <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> <b>wing</b> does...|$|R
50|$|The {{air intake}} of the {{turbojet}} engine {{was placed in}} the front and the engine itself in the lower fuselage. Two possible shoulder wing configurations were designed for the Fw Volksjäger 1, straight and <b>swept</b> <b>back.</b> The <b>wings</b> of the <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> version spanned 7.5 m (26 ft 7 in) and had an area of 13.5 m² (161 ft²). The tail was supported by a projecting boom over the exhaust of the engine. This fighter aircraft was planned to be armed with two MK 108 cannon, placed in a frontal position {{on both sides of the}} air intakes.|$|R
50|$|Palmer {{experimented with}} about 8 {{different}} hang glider versions and their wings were mostly 90 degree <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> <b>wings.</b> His smallest glider weighed 24 lb, {{and had a}} surface area of 205 sq ft. The flexibility in the frame caused no performance problems. His first and largest hang glider was about 45 pounds and had a surface area of 342 sq ft. Palmer explored control of his several versions of hang gliders by using different control frames: pilot {{in front of the}} control frame, pilot behind the control frame, and control frame in front of the pilot in a swing seat, which inadvertently approximated the George A. Spratt mechanism from 1929. NASA’s Paresev glider came to light after Palmer’s gliding flights, so it bore no influence on him.|$|E
50|$|The Hs 298 was a mid-wing {{monoplane}} with tapered <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> <b>wings</b> {{and it had}} {{a single}} horizontal stabiliser with twin vertical fins. It was powered by a Henschel-designed rocket motor built by Schmidding as the 109-543; it had two stages, the first high velocity stage was designed to leave the launch aircraft at 938 km/h (585 mph), in the second stage the speed was brought back to 682 km/h (425 mph) to give a maximum range of about 1.5 km. It used a Strassburg-Kehl FuG 203 radio guidance system powered by a propeller-driven (mounted on the nose) electric generator. The missile needed two crew on the launch aircraft to control it, one operator used a reflector-type sight to aim at the target and the other flew the missile using a joystick and another sight paired to the first with a servo system.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the derivation of empirical formulae for the loading distribution on straight tapered <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> <b>wings,</b> {{in terms of}} the parameters governing the geometric wing plan form.

40|$|A 35 deg. <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> <b>wing</b> of {{aspect ratio}} 7 has been {{designed}} so that, according to the R. A. E. Standard Method, the planform gives a constant spanwise CL distribution, whilst the camber and twist distributions, coupled with local thickness modifications, combine to provide identical chordwise pressure distributions at all spanwise stations at an overall C L of 0. 8. At mid-semi span the aerofoil section normal to the mean sweep line was a 12. 2 per cent thick R. A. E. 100, and the design CL was chosen {{to be close to}} the maximum values obtained experimentally for this section. Overall forces, flow visualization, and detailed pressure plotting tests were conducted on this model at three Reynolds numbers. The pressure plotting results showed that the theoretical loading was quite closely attained except close to the leading edge near the root and out towards the tip. Very high peak suctions were observed near the leading edge within the inboard 10 per cent of the span, and these tended to dominate the stall behaviour of the wing. Nevertheless, it was possible to identify swept wing versions of the various classifications of two-dimensional stall pattern, and a good correlation was obtained between the sectiona...|$|R
50|$|A {{positive}} {{sideslip angle}} generates empennage incidence {{which can cause}} positive or negative roll moment depending on its configuration. For any non-zero sideslip angle dihedral wings causes a rolling moment which tends to return the aircraft to the horizontal, as does <b>back</b> <b>swept</b> <b>wings.</b> With highly swept wings the resultant rolling moment may be excessive for all stability requirements and anhedral {{could be used to}} offset the effect of wing sweep induced rolling moment.|$|R

40|$|Low-speed {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to determine boundary layer and surface pressure distribution characteristics of a systematic family of <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> <b>wings.</b> It is intended that the test results will have application in giving {{a better understanding of}} the viscous flow phenomena on <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> <b>wings,</b> particularly in relation to the stall. A general picture of the boundary layer flow and surface pressure distribution at high lift conditions, showing the effects of variations in wing planform, was determined. Several existing concepts were verified and an attempt was made to define the limits of applicability of these concepts. A localized separation of the flow perpendicular to the leading edge of the wing, hereinafter referred to as the "normal flow", was found to occur at lift coefficients somewhat below the stall on the wings with appreciable sweepback. The separation took the form of a vortex streak running aft and outboard from an origin near the leading edge, and it greatly affected the boundary layer structure and the surface pressure distribution. Generalization of surface pressure distribution on the basis of the local lift coefficient and dynamic pressure for the normal flow was found to hold fairly well for the various sweepback angles. The development of stall was determined for the various planforms in terms of boundary layer thickness and flow direction near the surface of the wing. Generalization of the shape of the profiles of the normal boundary layer flow component in terms of a single family of shapes for all sweep-back angles, as suggested by other researchers, was shown to be possible...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} {{investigation}} Low order panel method with Dirichlet boundary condition conjugated with Kutta condition, was used to calculate pressure coefficients for potential flow about isolated <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> <b>wings</b> at different aspect ratios and different angles of attack. Also both local and total lift coefficients were calculated for the same wings, with detailed streamline behavior on both upper and lower surface. Constant strength quadrilateral doublet element and Constant strength quadrilateral source element were placed on each panel, except on wake sheet only constant strength quadrilateral doublets were placed to satisfy Kutta condition at trailing edge. A set of linear algebraic equations were established by setting inner potential equals to free stream potential. These equations were solved using Gauss-elimination to determine quadrilateral doublet singularity strength distribution. Finally finite difference formula was used to predict aerodynamic loads calculation...|$|E
50|$|Seebass and George {{also worked}} on the problem from a {{different}} angle, trying to spread out the N-wave laterally and temporally (longitudinally), by producing a strong and downwards-focused (SR-71 Blackbird, Boeing X-43) shock at a sharp, but wide angle nosecone, which will travel at slightly supersonic speed (bow shock), and using a <b>swept</b> <b>back</b> flying <b>wing</b> or an oblique flying wing to smooth out this shock along the direction of flight (the tail of the shock travels at sonic speed). To adapt this principle to existing planes, which generate a shock at their nose cone and an even stronger one at their wing leading edge, the fuselage below the wing is shaped according to the area rule. Ideally this would raise the characteristic altitude from 40000 ft to 60,000 feet (from 12,000 m to 18,000 m), which is where most SST aircraft were expected to fly.|$|R

5|$|The {{level of}} wing sweep, {{the angle of}} the wings in {{relation}} to the fuselage, can be altered in flight at the pilot's control. The variable wing can adopt any sweep angle between 25 degrees and 67 degrees, with a corresponding speed range for each angle; some Tornado ADVs were outfitted with an automatic wing-sweep system to reduce pilot workload. When the <b>wings</b> are <b>swept</b> <b>back,</b> the exposed <b>wing</b> area is lowered and drag is significantly decreased, which is conducive to performing high-speed low-level flight. The weapons pylons pivot with {{the angle of the}} variable-sweep wings so that the stores point in the direction of flight and do not hinder any wing positions.|$|R
5000|$|The lift from a wing is {{generated}} by the airflow over it from front to rear. With increasing span-wise flow the boundary layers {{on the surface of}} the wing have longer to travel, and so are thicker and more susceptible to transition to turbulence or flow separation, also the effective aspect ratio of the wing is less and so air [...] "leaks" [...] around the wing tips reducing their effectiveness. The spanwise flow on swept wings produces airflow that moves the stagnation point on the leading edge of any individual wing segment further beneath the leading edge, increasing effective angle of attack of wing segments relative to its neighbouring forward segment. The result is that wing segments farther towards the rear operate at increasingly higher angles of attack promoting early stall of those segments. This promotes tip stall on <b>back</b> <b>swept</b> <b>wings,</b> as the tips are most rearward, while delaying tip stall for forward swept wings, where the tips are forward. With both forward and <b>back</b> <b>swept</b> <b>wings,</b> the rear of the wing will stall first. This creates a nose-up pressure on the aircraft. If this is not corrected by the pilot it causes the plane to pitch up, leading to more of the wing stalling, leading to more pitch up, and so on. This problem came to be known as the Sabre dance in reference to the number of North American F-100 Super Sabres that crashed on landing as a result.|$|R
