40|$|Malignant mixed Müllerian tumours (malignant mixed mesodermal tumours, MMMT) of {{the uterus}} are {{metaplastic}} carcinomas with a sarcomatous component and thus they are also called carcinosarcomas. It has now been accepted that the sarcomatous component is derived from epithelial elements that have undergone metaplasia. The process that produces this metaplasia is epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which has recently {{been described as a}} neoplasia-associated programme shared with embryonic development and enabling neoplastic cells to move and metastasise. The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) regulates the turnover and functions of hundreds of cellular proteins. It plays important roles in EMT by being involved in the regulation of <b>several</b> <b>pathways</b> <b>participating</b> in the execution of this metastasis-associated programme. In this review the specifi c role of UPS in EMT of MMMT is discussed and therapeutic opportunities from UPS manipulations are proposed...|$|R
40|$|Anthocyanins are {{flavonoid}} pigments that {{accumulate in}} the large central vacuole of most plants. Inside the vacuole, anthocyanins can be found uniformly distributed {{or as part of}} sub-vacuolar pigment bodies, the Anthocyanic Vacuolar Inclusions (AVIs). Using Arabidopsis seedlings grown under anthocyanin-inductive conditions as a model to understand how AVIs are formed, we show here that the accumulation of AVIs strongly correlates with the formation of cyanidin 3 -glucoside (C 3 G) and derivatives. Arabidopsis mutants that fail to glycosylate anthocyanidins at the 5 -O position (5 gt mutant) accumulate AVIs in almost every epidermal cell of the cotyledons, as compared to wild-type seedlings, where {{only a small fraction of}} the cells show AVIs. A similar phenomenon is observed when seedlings are treated with vanadate. Highlighting a role for autophagy in the formation of the AVIs, we show that various mutants that interfere with the autophagic process (atg mutants) display lower numbers of AVIs, in addition to a reduced accumulation of anthocyanins. Interestingly, vanadate increases the numbers of AVIs in the atg mutants, suggesting that <b>several</b> <b>pathways</b> might <b>participate</b> in AVI formation. Taken together, our results suggest novel mechanisms for the formation of sub-vacuolar compartments capable of accumulating anthocyanin pigments...|$|R
40|$|Although {{a number}} of studies have {{considered}} the neural circuitry that regulates diaphragm activity, these pathways have not been adequately discerned, particularly in animals such as cats that utilize the respiratory muscles during a variety of different behaviors and movements. The present study employed the retrograde transneuronal transport of rabies virus to identify the extended neural pathways that control diaphragm function in felines. In all animals deemed to have successful rabies virus injections into the diaphragm, large, presumed motoneurons were infected in the C 4 –C 6 spinal segments. In addition, smaller presumed interneurons were labeled bilaterally throughout the cervical and upper thoracic spinal cord. While in short and intermediate survival cases, infected interneurons were concentrated in the vicinity of phrenic motoneurons, in late survival cases, the distribution of labeling was more expansive. Within the brain stem, the earliest infected neurons included those located in the classically defined pontine and medullary respiratory groups, the medial and lateral medullary reticular formation, the region immediately ventral to the spinal trigeminal nucleus, raphe pallidus and obscurus, and the vestibular nuclei. At longer survival times, infection appeared in the midbrain, which was concentrated in the lateral portion of the periaqueductal gray, the region of the tegmentum that contains the locomotion center, and the red nucleus. Considerable labeling was also present in the fastigial nucleus of the cerebellum, portions of the posterior and lateral hypothalamus and the adjacent fields of Forel known to contain hypocretin-containing neurons and the precruciate gyrus of cerebral cortex. These data raise the possibility that <b>several</b> parallel <b>pathways</b> <b>participate</b> in regulating the activity of the feline diaphragm, which underscores the multifunctional nature of the respiratory muscles in this species...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Vertebrate limb {{development}} {{involves a}} reciprocal feedback loop between limb mesenchyme and the overlying apical ectodermal ridge (AER). <b>Several</b> gene <b>pathways</b> <b>participate</b> in this feedback loop, including Fgf signaling. In the forelimb lateral plate mesenchyme, Tbx 5 activates Fgf 10 expression, {{which in turn}} initiates and maintains the mesenchyme/AER Fgf signaling loop. Recent findings have revealed that Tbx 5 transcriptional activity is regulated by dynamic nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and interaction with Pdlim 7, a PDZ-LIM protein family member, along actin filaments. This Tbx 5 regulation is critical in heart formation, but the coexpression of both proteins in other developing tissues suggests a broader functional role. Results Knock-down of Pdlim 7 function leads to decreased pectoral fin cell proliferation resulting in a severely stunted fin phenotype. While early gene induction and patterning in the presumptive fin field appear normal, the pectoral fin precursor cells display compaction and migration defects between 18 and 24 hours post-fertilization (hpf). During fin growth fgf 24 is sequentially expressed in the mesenchyme {{and then in the}} apical ectodermal ridge (AER). However, in pdlim 7 antisense morpholino-treated embryos this switch of expression is prevented and fgf 24 remains ectopically active in the mesenchymal cells. Along with the lack of fgf 24 in the AER, other critical factors including fgf 8 are reduced, suggesting signaling problems to the underlying mesenchyme. As a consequence of perturbed AER function in the absence of Pdlim 7, pathway components in the fin mesenchyme are misregulated or absent, indicating a breakdown of the Fgf signaling feedback loop, which is ultimately responsible for the loss of fin outgrowth. Conclusion This work provides the first evidence for the involvement of Pdlim 7 in pectoral fin development. Proper fin outgrowth requires fgf 24 downregulation in the fin mesenchyme with subsequent activation in the AER, and Pdlim 7 appears to regulate this transition, potentially through Tbx 5 regulation. By controlling Tbx 5 subcellular localization and transcriptional activity and possibly additional yet unknown means, Pdlim 7 is required for proper development of the heart and the fins. These new regulatory mechanisms may have important implications how we interpret Tbx 5 function in congenital hand/heart syndromes in humans. </p...|$|R

However, the underlying mechanisms regulating chicken growth and development have rarely been studied. This study aimed to identify candidate genes involved in chicken growth and investigated the potential regulatory mechanisms of early growth in chicken. RNA sequencing was applied to compare the transcriptomes of chicken muscle tissues at three developmental stages during early growth. In total, 978 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (fold change ≥ 2; false discovery rate < 0. 05) were detected by pairwise comparison. Functional analysis showed that the DEGs are mainly involved in the processes of cell growth, muscle development, and cellular activities (such as junction, migration, assembly, differentiation, and proliferation). Many of the DEGs are well known {{to be related to}} chicken growth, such as MYOD 1, GH, IGF 2 BP 2, IGFBP 3, SMYD 1, CEBPB, FGF 2, and IGFBP 5. KEGG pathway analysis identified that the DEGs were significantly enriched in five pathways (P < 0. 1) related to growth and development: extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, tight junction, insulin signaling pathway, and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. A total of 42 DEGs assigned to these pathways are potential candidate genes inducing the difference in growth among the three developmental stages, such as MYH 10, FGF 2, FGF 16, FN 1, CFL 2, MAPK 9, IRS 1, PHKA 1, PHKB, and PHKG 1. Thus, our study identified a series of genes and <b>several</b> <b>pathways</b> that may <b>participate</b> in the regulation of early growth in chicken.
