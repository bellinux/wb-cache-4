In this paper, the maximum wind power penetration focusing on system inertia and primary reserve value is assessed. The Spanish power system is used as an example for the calculation of these values.

40|$|Limited {{research}} has been done on exoskeletons to enable faster movements of the lower extremities. An exoskeleton’s mechanism can actually hinder agility by adding weight, inertia and friction to the legs; compensating inertia through control is particularly difficult due to instability issues. The added inertia will reduce the natural frequency of the legs, probably leading to lower step frequency during walking. We present a control method that produces an approximate compensation of an exoskeleton’s inertia. The aim is making the natural frequency of the exoskeleton-assisted leg larger than that of the unaided leg. The method uses admittance control to compensate the weight and friction of the exoskeleton. Inertia compensation is emulated by adding a feedback loop consisting of low-pass filtered acceleration multiplied by a negative gain. This gain <b>simulates</b> negative <b>inertia</b> in the low-frequency range. We tested the controller on a statically supported, single-DOF exoskeleton that assists swing movements of the leg.

40|$|Abstract—A {{new method}} of lower-limb {{exoskeleton}} control {{aimed at improving}} the agility of leg-swing motion is presented. In the absence of control, an exoskeleton’s mechanism usually hinders agility by adding mechanical impedance to the legs. The uncompensated inertia of the exoskeleton will reduce the natural frequency of leg swing, probably leading to lower step frequency during walking as well as increased metabolic energy consumption. The proposed controller emulates inertia compensation by adding a feedback loop consisting of low-pass filtered angular acceleration multiplied by a negative gain. This gain <b>simulates</b> negative <b>inertia</b> in the low-frequency range. The resulting controller combines two assistive effects: increasing the natural frequency of the lower limbs and performing net work per swing cycle. The controller was tested on a statically mounted exoskeleton that assists knee flexion and extension. Subjects performed movement sequences, first unassisted and then using the exoskeleton, {{in the context of}} a computer-based task resembling a race. In the exoskeleton’s baseline state, the frequency of leg swing and the mean angular velocity were consistently reduced. The addition of inertia compensation enabled subjects to recover their normal frequency and increase their selected angular velocity. The work performed by the exoskeleton was evidenced by catch trials in the protocol. Index Terms—Admittance control, exoskeleton, rehabilitation robotics. I...|$|R

40|$|Near-to-reality {{endurance}} {{testing of}} bikes An innovative test setup for complete bikes has been built. It {{consists of a}} three main parts: -	a servo driven drum -	a servo driven brake actuator -	a set of two servo driven “legs” Any type of bike can be tested without modification, just by using a cantilever arm to push the rear wheel of the bike on the drum. The drum is used to drive the rear wheel of the bike and <b>simulate</b> <b>inertia</b> forces, slope of the track, rolling resistance and air resistance. Internal resistance to acceleration of the drum is compensated. Since the drum is servo driven, any net torque {{as a function of}} speed can be applied. The forces applied by the cyclist are reproduced by the servo driven legs and can be alternated with braking forces on the rear wheel. The setup has initially been designed to perform endurance tests on mounted brake systems. The brake lever is pulled and controlled in order to cause a specific deceleration of the bike. After release of the lever the bike is accelerated by the drum and brakes are cooled based on scanned temperature values. The braking cycle is then repeated. For any brake system the number of “cycles to adjustment” and the number of “cycles to failure” can be measured according to the international standard Eumos 40701 - 1. In a second faze the test setup was extended to allow for endurance tests on the driving train of a bike. Each pedal is driven by an independent servo controlled leg. The forces on the pedals can vary {{as a function of the}} position of the pedal and can depend on the actual speed. The drum is used to generate the real life resistance forces. The test is applicable for any type of derailleur system as well as for e-bikes using a rear wheel drive or a crank motor. Right from the first tests it is observed that the frame of a bike is crucial for both types of tests. Forces on pedals do cause global deformation of the bike frame especially during “in the saddle” biking. Real life pedal forces can be measured easily using commer¬cially available sensors. Measured forces are categorized according to conventional theory for accelerated endurance testing. Categorized forces are applied on the pedals. They can be inter¬rupted by simulating an emergency brake if relevant. Unintentionally some poor quality metal frames failed completely. For composite frames an increase in deformation is observed. Therefore it is concluded that this test setup is very suitable for near-to-reality testing of complete bikes. Apparently it is very promising to quantify relevant bike stiffness parameters and their decrease during bicycle life time. However further improvements of the current setup are recommended, e. g. introduction of reaction forces on the steering bar could be important to improve the correlation between lab tests and reality. Ultimately it is expected that the remaining safe life time of a bike will be predictable using the test setup as described. status: submitte...|$|R

The PRWP system was modified to the new Mk. III configuration, which adopted the MATLAB xPC kernel for better real-time hardware control. Also the Litton LN- 200 IMU was integrated onto the PRWP and replaced the previous attitude sensor. Through the comparison of various control laws through motion tests the Mk.

Two fixed-gain controllers, full-state feedback (FSFB) and linear quadratic regulator with set-point control(LQRSP), and two adaptive controllers, nonlinear direct model reference adaptive controller (NDMRAC) and the adaptive output feedback (AOF), were each tested in three different cases of varying plant parameters to test controller robustness through real-time motion tests.

These functional requirements were used to determine the main product modules (rollers, frame, and ramp) and desired features (simulated natural inertia/forces, varying resistance, tilt feature, etc.) Keeping these in consideration, initial calculations and hands-on research were performed in particular to determine the effect of radial load and RPMs on the bearings.

40|$|Introduction: Surface {{irrigation}} {{methods are}} the most common methods for irrigation of agricultural land. These methods are superior to sprinkler, drip and underground irrigation, because they have lower costs of funding and implementation, is inexpensive, needed maintenance of equipment is simple and does not require skilled labor. New requirements for the use of municipal water, energy, industrial, and military intends to further improve the performance of surface irrigation systems. In other words, the low efficiency of surface irrigation is not related to the method of it, but the weakness is because of the design, implementation and management. Due to the special place of Khuzestan province in southwest of Iran in agriculture and applied surface irrigation for most of the farms in this province, {{in the present study was}} simulated water flow in furrow irrigation by using WinSRFR 4. 1 and the optimum length of furrow was determined in the experimental farm of the Water Sciences Engineering Shoshtar University. For this purpose, advance and recession of flow were <b>simulated</b> by Zero <b>inertia</b> and Kinematic wave model and result were compared with observed data. Materials and Methods: In order to calculate and predicte advance and recession curves field measurement is necessary, but it takes a lot of time and cost. Therefore, the use of mathematical models and software for access information is important. In this research the amount of advance in furrow irrigation was measured and the results were compared with simulation of WinSRFR 4. 1. Field experiments was conducted in the research field of Water Sciences Engineering Shoshtar University. Data were collected from three furrows. The lengths of them were 60, 80 and 100 meters. Irrigation was performed under three discharges (1, 1. 25 and 1. 5 L/s), with three iterations. Three experiments furrows were provided which central furrow was for measurement data and side furrows were as buffer furrow. Before experiment in order to determine soil texture undisturbed soil samples were prepared from four depths 25 - 0, 50 - 25, 75 - 50 and 100 - 75 cm. Soil texture was determined in laboratory using the hydrometer method. The water supply was transported by pumping the water to the farm. This research was conducted in the winter of 2012 and spring of 2013. The end of furrow was opened. Input and output flows were controlled with W. S. C flume. Infiltration data were also measured according to two point method. Model using 27 set of field data was run and the results were compared with WinSRFR 4. 1 software. For evaluating the results of the model were used Esfandiari and Maheshwari’s statistical method. Results and Discussion: For comparison between measurement and simulation data,, and indices were applied. The results of this study indicated that the phase advance of predicted values for all models is greater than the observed values.
