5|$|Each level casts {{players as}} a {{different}} colored Yoshi, who must escort Baby Mario {{on his back}} and reach the end of the level, where he is passed on to the next Yoshi. Similar to Super Mario World, Yoshi can use his tongue to ensnare enemies and put them into his mouth. When something is in his mouth, Yoshi can either spit it out as an attack, or swallow it to turn it into an egg. These eggs can then be thrown at an angle, even bouncing off walls, to attack enemies or reach far away or hard to reach items. Yoshi can carry up to six eggs at a time, with some colored eggs spawning items once they hit something. Yoshi can also eat watermelons that let him <b>spit</b> <b>out</b> seeds, or flaming enemies that let him <b>spit</b> <b>out</b> fire. Yoshi is also able to perform a flutter jump, in which he can kick his legs in mid-air to gain extra height or hover over long distances, and a ground pound, a downward attack that can hammer down on enemies and stumps.|$|E
5|$|German glass {{ornaments}} {{were introduced}} to America by Frank Woolworth in the 1880s but such ornaments were produced under labor-intensive conditions and were expensive, with few Americans being able to afford {{more than one or}} two ornaments per year. On the eve of World War II, however, American companies began manufacturing inexpensive, mass-produced ornaments that made it possible for almost any American to have an extensive collection of Christmas ornaments for little cost within moments. With a few modifications, Corning Glass's light bulb machine could <b>spit</b> <b>out</b> 2,000 blank glass ornaments a minute that were then bought by ornament companies to be decorated, packaged and sold by the dozen.|$|E
5|$|Some ignorant clerics reject {{calculations}} {{of this kind}} (for shame!) and {{do not wish to}} keep their phylacteries, that is, they do not preserve the order, which they have received in the bosom of mother church, nor do they persist in the holy teaching of meditation. They should consider carefully the way of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and they should <b>spit</b> <b>out</b> their doctrine like filth. A cleric ought to be the keeper of his own soul, just as a noble man subjects a young foal to the yoke, so he ought to subject his own soul to service, by filling the alabaster box with precious oil, that is, he ought to be inwardly subjected daily, by obeying the divine laws and admonitions of the Redeemer.|$|E

5|$|Filming the pre-title {{sequence}} {{went through}} some alterations. One {{of the scenes}} saw Johnny being foot whipped, however the shot where the stick struck the soles of the feet was cut out due to its brutality. Also, when discussing how Johnny would be expelled from the mosque afterwards, Nalluri suggested using the idea where he is thrown {{to the top of}} the surveillance van, which would give the audience the impression that the antagonists were on to them. Later on in the episode, Nalluri wanted to include some exposition shots, which shows Khaldun's actions while he narrates them to MI5. In one scene, Tom observes Khaldun inside a prison cell by opening a slide view at the prison door. However one had to be made because no such doors exist in the United Kingdom. Following the broadcast of the episode, the producers were surprised to hear that the BBC were unhappy with a scene showing Harry holding a Costa Coffee cup, as the corporation believed it was done out of product placement. They were also surprised to learn that they did not take notice in a scene with Malcolm Wynn-Jones delightfully eating a piece of chocolate from a Black Magic chocolate box, which they thought was a more obvious example. Portraying actor Hugh Simon had to <b>spit</b> <b>out</b> the chocolate after the take as he disliked the confectionery.|$|E
5|$|Leopards and ladybirds are spotted; {{angelfish}} and zebras are striped. These patterns have {{an evolutionary}} explanation: they have functions which {{increase the chances}} that the offspring of the patterned animal will survive to reproduce. One function of animal patterns is camouflage; for instance, a leopard that is harder to see catches more prey. Another function is signalling — for instance, a ladybird {{is less likely to}} be attacked by predatory birds that hunt by sight, if it has bold warning colours, and is also distastefully bitter or poisonous, or mimics other distasteful insects. A young bird may see a warning patterned insect like a ladybird and try to eat it, but it will only do this once; very soon it will <b>spit</b> <b>out</b> the bitter insect; the other ladybirds in the area will remain undisturbed. The young leopards and ladybirds, inheriting genes that somehow create spottedness, survive. But while these evolutionary and functional arguments explain why these animals need their patterns, they do not explain how the patterns are formed.|$|E

25|$|The {{invention}} of the cavity magnetron made possible the production of electromagnetic waves of a small enough wavelength (microwaves). The magnetron was originally a crucial component {{in the development of}} short wavelength radar during World War II. In 19371940, a multi-cavity magnetron was built by the British physicist Sir John Turton Randall, FRSE, together with a team of British coworkers, for the British and American military radar installations in World War II. A more high-powered microwave generator that worked at shorter wavelengths was needed, and in 1940, at the University of Birmingham in England, Randall and Harry Boot produced a working prototype. They invented a valve that could <b>spit</b> <b>out</b> pulses of microwave radio energy on a wavelength of 10cm, an unprecedented discovery.|$|E

500|$|The game {{introduces}} Yoshi, {{a dinosaur}} companion whom Mario can ride {{and who is}} able to eat most enemies. If Yoshi attempts to eat a Koopa or its shell, he will hold it in his mouth {{for a period of time}} before swallowing it; Yoshi can also <b>spit</b> <b>out</b> the shell and fire it at enemies. When holding any Koopa shell in its mouth, Yoshi gains the ability that corresponds to its own colour: a blue shell enables Yoshi to fly, a yellow shell causes Yoshi to emit dust clouds that kills nearby enemies, and a red shell allows Yoshi to produce three fireballs. Flashing Koopa shells produce all three abilities, while green shells produce none. The default Yoshi is green, but the game also contains hidden blue, yellow, and red Yoshis; the player can obtain each coloured Yoshi by finding its egg in hidden areas and feeding enemies to it until it matures.|$|E
500|$|Actress Kate Flannery {{later said}} that the days of filming were {{extremely}} [...] "hot", and she became sick of hot dogs after eating {{many of them in}} the contest seen in the episode. Many cast members <b>spit</b> <b>out</b> the hot dogs after putting them in their mouths, an act that sometimes activated Ed Helms' gag reflex. The cast members found the sumo suits uncomfortable, both due to the hot weather and the inability to sit down. Actress Angela Kinsey previewed before the episode broadcast that she would [...] "forever look at John Krasinski differently, because he looked so hilarious to me" [...] wearing his sumo suit. For the scenes of Helms floating in the lake in his sumo suit, the actor wore a harness and a fishing line that snaked out through his sleeve, the purpose being to drag him farther out on the lake. A crew member pulled him in a row boat; the crew would film a take of the scene, and then would have to wait fifteen minutes to do it again.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "All Hands on the Bad One" [...] {{features}} guitar riffs {{that are}} reminiscent of the band's second album, Call the Doctor. It {{was chosen as the}} title track because, according to guitarist Carrie Brownstein, it is the song that best represents the sentiment of the album. Brownstein explained that the song deals with [...] "your relationship to evil and your relationship to the hypocrisy of forcing a morality on someone else when you yourself are no better." [...] She added, [...] "'Ballad of the Ladyman', for instance—who is 'the ladyman'? Is the person that wants to be on the radio, 'the bad one,' or is it the fans assuming that they [...] {{want to be on the}} radio—are they 'the bad one'? Or is 'The Professional,' the ominous professional figure, 'the bad one'? I think all these songs can go into that machine of 'the bad one' and that mentality and then be <b>spit</b> <b>out</b> in a bunch of different scenarios. So that's why I think it works as the title." ...|$|E

500|$|Dead Head Fred is a third-person action-adventure {{game that}} {{incorporates}} {{a variety of}} gameplay styles, including combat, platforming, and puzzles. [...] The core gameplay of Dead Head Fred revolves around Fred's missing head {{and his ability to}} [...] "switch" [...] heads by defeating certain enemies, decapitating them, and collecting their heads (referred to as [...] "headhunting"). [...] As Fred explores the city of Hope Falls, he can collect an assortment of heads, each of which has unique abilities. [...] Examples include the Stone Idol head, which Fred can use as a battering ram, and the Corpse head, which can be used to suck up and <b>spit</b> <b>out</b> water, gasoline, and other materials. [...] Fred uses these heads to navigate the city of Hope Falls, and certain parts of the city are not accessible until certain heads are found. [...] The high level of radiation in Hope Falls has led to a proliferation of grossly mutated worms, which the player can collect and use to upgrade Fred's heads and temporarily increase his fighting abilities, among other benefits. Also collectible are money and special items, which can be earned by defeating enemies or completing various side-missions. [...] There are several minigames unrelated to the plot, such as pinball and fishing, scattered around the city.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} written at the ocean's point of view, {{detailing}} the human's evolution. According to Jason Killingsworth from Paste magazine, it calls listeners' attention to [...] "Mother Oceania" [...] {{from which the}} singer believes all life emerged, whilst she sings: [...] "You have done well for yourselves / Since you left my wet embrace / And crawled ashore [...] ". The song anchors the midsection of Medúlla, [...] "jubilantly punctuated with bubbling synth and propelled by the rolling, spitfire cadence of Rahzel's beatbox", according to the reviewer. The last line from the song, [...] "Your sweat is salty/ And I am why/ Your sweat is salty/ And I am why", is about how [...] "we were all little jellyfish or whatever before we made it on to land", according to the singer. Elthan Brown from New York magazine considered these lyrics as [...] "frank sensuality". [...] "Oceania" [...] also features The London Choir. Entertainment Weeklys writer Chris Willman commented that [...] "the computer-enhanced choir behind Björk [...] a cosmic harem of pleased dolphins.

500|$|Caroline Bansal from musicOMH gave a mixed {{review for}} the song, {{feeling that the}} singer's vocals over the Spanish guitar was monotonous.

Bansal said that [...] "Love Profusion" [...] could have been composed better. Ed Howard from Stylus Magazine wrote that [...] "Love Profusion", along with the song [...] "Intervention", [...] "address Madonna's marriage to director Guy Ritchie", and [...] "find the once-cynical pop star surprisingly open and emotional, which prompts her to <b>spit</b> <b>out</b> cliché after cliché as she tells us how happy she is".

It fuses the message behind the song American Life with Mirwais' beats and acoustic elements really well". Sean O'Brien from The People complimented the song for its [...] "great melody and acoustic guitar flavor to it", and deduced {{that it would be a}} hit in the night clubs. Dan Gennoe from Dotmusic website gave a positive review of the track, calling [...] "Love Profusion", along with [...] "Intervention" [...] and [...] "X-Static Process" [...] from American Life, [...] "gracious" [...] and [...] "beautiful" [...] songs.

They received the honours of the Emperor, with gold and silver, {{and every one of them}} received a different gift. It is known that in both the Parthian Empire and Kushan Empire of Asia, ethnic Greeks continued to be employed after the Hellenistic period as musicians and athletes. The Book of the Later Han states that Emperor An transferred these entertainers from his countryside residence to the capital Luoyang, where they gave a performance at his court and were rewarded with gold, silver, and other gifts. Raoul McLaughlin notes that the Romans knew Burma as India Trans Gangem (India Beyond the Ganges) and that Ptolemy listed the cities of Burma. McLaughlin speculates that the Romans were selling slaves to the Burmese and that this is how the entertainers originally reached Burma before they were sent by the Burmese ruler to Emperor An in China. Syrian jugglers were renowned in Western Classical literature, and Chinese sources from the 2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD mention them as well.|$|E
