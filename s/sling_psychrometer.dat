40|$|Transcription begins] Det. 24 th Weather SquadronMountain Home, IdahoApril 25, 1943 Dear Friends at Bryant, Due to my {{moving about}} from one station to another your Easter present {{was a bit}} late for Easter, {{but it was a}} {{birthday}} gift as well as it arrived on my twenty-third birthday. May I express my thanks to the Bryant Service Club for making it possible for us to receive such gifts and I would like the person who has the knack for knitting [to] know that her handiwork is appreciated. I’d like to tell you of our work here at Mountain Home and the activity on the base, but you know how things are. We are at a base that is at least thirty miles from the nearest mountains hence the mane Mountain Home, Although we are out on the desert in the wild and wooly West, we do have fine recreational facilities. As at most bases there are Post Exchanges, a thereafter or two, a gymnasium for P. T., and a fine Service Club for Enlisted Men. We have a fine dance band which is made up of part of the regular military band, but it is the best G. I. dance band I’ve heard in months. As we are about fifty miles from Boise, there are times when we can go there and twice a month two buses fill of the fair sea come out to the desert for dances at the Service Club. How are things going this year at Bryant? Are there many more changes in the teaching staff? I suppose the College is about “ninety-nine and forty-four hundreds percent” girls now with all the man power either digging for bombs, flying planes, or plotting weather charts. It looks as though I’ll be moving out of U. S. again as more and more women are getting into my line. It hardly seems that over two years have gone by since I left Bryant, but in two months I’ll have been wearing brown for two years. Ratings have been rather slow in my group in face after eighteen months one gets awful tired of writing the same rank beside his name. I trust you’ll pardon this bit of gripping, but you know the old saying “A fellow can’t be a good soldier if he hasn’t something to squawk about”. Perhaps I’ll be a soldier yet. After twenty one months of service I manage to fire on the range and I don’t mean fire a range as I did several times when cooking last year. I won’t tell you my score – it’s not polite to brag – they too I don’t I don’t want you to think I am lazy for if I remember right I had very little patching to do on the targets I aimed at. From the remarks of the other weather buds it looks as though I’d better stick to <b>slinging</b> a <b>psychrometer</b> and not volunteer for the infantry. A. F. B. Thanks again for the Easter present and all the other packages. SincerelyAnthony F. Bowler Have you heard from many of the boys of the classes of August 1941 and 1942. I know about Alfred Rockwood and about where he is. Dave Larson is in the Seabees somewhere. If you are having any bulletins on any of the fellows I certainly {{would like to know what}} is going on. Well in about two minutes I can take the ______ gas mask off and go to chow. You see about every Tuesday they spray gas around and see how many fellows are caught without their masks. Of course, to my way of thinking, I don’t believe in regular routine gas drills any more than routine fire drills in a school. For testing purposes the surprise method seems to be practical. Of course, if a fellow is caught without his mask at the time he may get some for of duty to that he’ll remember when Tuesday comes but he certainly won’t forget how – the tear gas makes him cry.

50|$|The U.S. Signal Service, a {{predecessor}} to the Weather Bureau, {{occupied the}} summit and kept records from 1870 to 1892. Starting in 1932 the current observatory began keeping records. In 1934 the observatory recorded a wind gust {{that at the}} time had the highest speed in the world, a record that was held until 1996. The observatory's weather data have accumulated into a valuable climate record since. Temperature and humidity readings have been collected using a <b>sling</b> <b>psychrometer,</b> a simple device containing two mercury thermometers. Where most unstaffed weather stations have undergone technology upgrades, consistent use of the <b>sling</b> <b>psychrometer</b> has helped provide scientific precision to the Mount Washington climate record.|$|E
50|$|The {{humidity}} of an air-water vapor {{mixture is}} determined {{through the use}} of psychrometric charts if both the dry bulb temperature (T) and the wet bulb temperature (Tw) of the mixture are known. These quantities are readily estimated by using a <b>sling</b> <b>psychrometer.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{psychrometer}} is {{a device}} that includes both a dry-bulb and a wet-bulb thermometer. A <b>sling</b> <b>psychrometer</b> requires manual operation to create the airflow over the bulbs, but a powered psychrometer includes a fan for this function. Knowing both the dry-bulb temperature (DBT) and wet-bulb temperature (WBT), one can determine the relative humidity (RH) from the psychrometric chart appropriate to the air pressure.|$|E
50|$|A <b>sling</b> <b>psychrometer,</b> {{which uses}} {{thermometers}} {{attached to a}} handle or length of rope and spun {{in the air for}} about one minute, is sometimes used for field measurements, but is being replaced by more convenient electronic sensors. A whirling psychrometer uses the same principle, but the two thermometers are fitted into a device that resembles a ratchet or football rattle.|$|E
50|$|Evaporation is an {{important}} part of the water cycle. It is partly affected by humidity, which can be measured by a <b>sling</b> <b>psychrometer.</b> It is also affected by the presence of snow, hail and ice and can relate to dew, mist and fog. Hydrology considers evaporation of various forms: from water surfaces; as transpirationfrom plant surfaces in natural and agronomic ecosystems. A direct measurement of evaporation can be obtained using Simon's evaporation pan.|$|E
5000|$|Wet-bulb {{temperature}} is measured using a thermometer {{that has its}} bulb wrapped in cloth—called a sock—that is kept wet with distilled water via wicking action. Such an instrument is called a wet-bulb thermometer. A widely used device for measuring wet and dry bulb {{temperature is}} a <b>sling</b> <b>psychrometer,</b> which consists {{of a pair of}} mercury bulb thermometers, one with a wet [...] "sock" [...] to measure the wet-bulb temperature and the other with the bulb exposed and dry for the dry-bulb temperature. The thermometers are attached to a swivelling handle which allows them to be whirled around so that water evaporates from the sock and cools the wet bulb until it reaches thermal equilibrium.|$|E
5000|$|In {{situations}} where modern instruments are not available, an index finger {{can be used}} to test the direction of wind. This is accomplished by wetting the finger and pointing it upwards. The side of the finger that feels [...] "cool" [...] is (approximately) the direction from which the wind is blowing. The [...] "cool" [...] sensation is caused by an increased rate of evaporation of the moisture on the finger due to the air flow across the finger, and consequently the [...] "finger technique" [...] of measuring wind direction does not work well in either very humid or very hot conditions. The same principle is used to measure the dew point using a <b>sling</b> <b>psychrometer</b> (a more accurate instrument than the human finger).|$|E

She then left Chicago in 1917 for Pittsburgh and the Carrier Engineering Corporation, where her interest in air conditioning began. She received the Mechanical Engineering professional degree in 1920 {{and the next year}} she joined the American Society of Heating and Ventilating Engineers research lab, where she studied air conditioning for six years. [...] "She perfected a new portable machine that determines the amount of germ-laden dust in schoolrooms and public places" [...] while conducting field tests for the New York Commission on School Ventilation. In 1931, she returned to the Carrier-Lyle Corporation where she stayed until her retirement.

50|$|Depending {{on their}} {{qualifications}} and skill levels, crews may {{be divided into}} squads (4 or 5 firefighters each). The more qualified crews will have specialized personnel such as sawyers and EMTs. Crews and managers must always monitor the fire and consider safety. They will often designate one or two crew members {{to act as a}} lookout. This person generally has a few years of experience and is placed at a location where they can see {{a large portion of the}} fire. For larger fires there are multiple lookouts positioned around the entire fire. They watch for spot fires (fire that crosses the fireline) and take weather readings using a <b>sling</b> <b>psychrometer</b> or a kestral typically every hour and relaying them up the chain of command. Aircraft can also serve as lookouts at times, but this is not the preferred option.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{activity}} is to measure relative humidity using both a <b>sling</b> <b>psychrometer</b> and a digital hygrometer. Intended outcomes are that students learn to quantify humidity {{and that there is}} a limit to the amount of water vapor that the air can hold. Students gain insight into why rain drops and snow flakes form and why there is precipitation. Supporting background materials for both student and teacher are included.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from July 28, 2016 - January 28, 2017 Lower atmospheric flux measurements are a difficult subset of atmospheric data to accurately collect. The interplay of cost, precision, specialty, resolution and repeatability compound an already difficult experimental problem. In response to this, a new, novel instrumentation approach to measuring within the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is introduced. The combination of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) technology are an unlikely pairing that show great potential for providing unprecedented levels of spatial and temporal resolution of the natural world. This pairing was deployed to the Oxbow Conservation Area near Bates, OR in July 2015 to measure vertically stratified temperature profiles. Additional modifications to the fiber optic cables were done in order to replicate the <b>sling</b> <b>psychrometer</b> approach to measuring humidity values by replicating a ‘dry’ and ‘wet’ bulb thermometer capable of measuring temperature gradients at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Out of 23 UAV flights conducted, thirteen provided usable data. Measurements and calculations were compared to a co-located Open Path Gas Analyzer and Sonic Anemometer (Irgason) for accuracy and precision. Four flights showed strong correlation to Eddy-Covariance calculations on sensible heat and evaporative flux. Moreso, the modified DTS field deployment provided new insights into stratified heterogeneities in vapor pressure, temperature, sensible heat, evaporative flux and temperature variance...|$|E
40|$|Torgac Cave, {{located in}} south-central New Mexico is {{remarkable}} {{for at least}} three reasons: its extraor-dinary gypsum speleothems, its large bat population, and the unusually cold temperatures within the cave. It has been proposed that the presence of the bats and the speleothems {{may be related to the}} anom-alous temperatures observed in the cave. This paper reports the results of a five week study of cave air temperature and relative humidity conducted during January-February 1995. Several different techniques were employed to measure the temperature and relative humidity (RH) of the cave atmosphere. A <b>sling</b> <b>psychrometer</b> was used to make spot measurements of temperature and RH at 11 locations throughout the cave on two successive dates. In addition, hourly measurements of air tem-perature and RH at a single location were recorded over a five week period using a capacitance probe and data logger. A novel technique for inferring RH was also attempted in which kaolinite clay samples were placed at different locations throughout the cave, and at different elevations above the cave floor at a single loca-tion, and allowed to equilibrate with the cave air. Subsequent laboratory analysis of the water activity and gravimetric water content of the clay samples following equilibration allowed the time-averaged RH to be inferred, and these data were used to reconstruct the vertical RH profile of the cave atmosphere...|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} two-year {{study of}} the microclimate in Kartchner Caverns determined that the most significant problem in maintaining the microclimate of the cave {{is the potential for}} drying out due to increased air-flow. Two factors—a small, hypothesized upper second entrance and a slight geothermal warming of the cave—control natural airflow and increase the amount and intensity of winter air exchange. The average amount of water reaching the cave is 7. 9 mm/yr, only twice the amount lost by evaporation from cave surfaces. Kartchner Caverns has an average relative humidity (RH) of 99. 4 %. Useful mea-surement of RH required a dewpoint soil psychrometer rather than a <b>sling</b> <b>psychrometer.</b> Moisture loss from cave surfaces is proportional to relative humidity, and small changes in RH have a dramatic effect on evaporation from cave surfaces. A lowering of RH to 98. 7 % would double the evaporation rate and start to dry out the cave. The volume of air exchange in the cave was estimated from direct measurement, changes in CO 2 con-centration, and temperature profile models. All of these methods are consistent with a volume of 4, 000 m/day entering the cave during the winter. During the summer, the direction of airflow reverses and the volume of air leaving the cave is much smaller than during the winter months. Surface air is almost always drier than cave air—only during the summer months when rain occurs does outside air contai...|$|E
40|$|Theory and {{previous}} research suggest that sky obstructions and humidity can degrade global navigation satellite system (GNSS) positioning accuracy for static observation sessions. It {{is reasonable to}} suppose that these effects might be even worse for real-time kinematic (RTK) positioning, because the observer will likely collect fewer observations for RTK positioning than for a static occupation, so the statistics used to estimate the positions have fewer data to work with. These effects have not been thoroughly studied, which provided the motivation to conduct several experiments to quantity the effects. Temperature and humidity are variables of interest, so the first experiment establishes whether a digital weather station is an acceptable replacement for a <b>sling</b> <b>psychrometer.</b> The second experiment quantifies RTK positioning accuracy affected by broad-leaf canopy conditions with the effect of ground-level absolute humidity {{and the effect of}} sky obstruction as determined using analysis of covariance; this is to study the RTK position-accuracy degradation caused by the water content in the atmosphere and by the possible signal blockage from physical structures around the occupation site. These results were then applied to extend previously published work about a work on habitat-suitability and environmental favorability maps for bentgrass species in Connecticut with logistic regression analysis from GNSS data. The information gained from the experiments was used to study four new biological habitat suitability and environmental favorability models by comparing their strengths and weaknesses using GIS mapping and multiple comparison statistics of the created maps...|$|E
40|$|The {{internship}} {{requirements for}} Master of Applied Science in Materials Conservation were {{completed in the}} Materials Conservation laboratory of the Australian Museum {{under the direction of}} Miss Sue Walston between November 30 th, 1981 and July 9 th, 1982. The work programme focused upon the preparation of artefacts for a permanent gallery display entitled "The Abelam, a people of Papua New Guinea". Wooden carvings, shell ornaments, bone implements, ceramic and coconut bowls, and wooden spears were the most common artefact types requiring treatment, prior to display. Many objects were decorated with pigments, shells, beads or feathers and were secured with plied fibre string. Artefacts were photographed, condition and proposed treatment reports were written, practical work was carried out and final treatment reports were finished. Upon completion of the gallery, the Materials Conservation laboratory staff reviewed their role in the overall gallery plan. As a group, the problems affecting the conservation and display of artefacts were identified and analysed. A flow chart of exhibition guidelines for Materials Conservation was prepared for use when planning future galleries. The relative humidity and temperature were monitored regularly in various areas throughout the museum. Accurate readings were obtained using a <b>sling</b> <b>psychrometer</b> and thermohygrographs. Each week the modes of the relative humidity charts were calculated, analysed and recorded. While treating objects for the Abelarn gallery, the need for specifically coloured support materials became evident. Dye types capable of permanently colouring a diverse range of cellulosic materials were investigated. Trichromatic colour cards were prepared for each material. A flood occurred in the Aboriginal gallery which required immediate action by the conservation staff. Affected artefacts were transported to the laboratory, stabilized and reports on their condition were written. A workshop on microscopic examination of cellulosic materials was organized by Mary-Lou Florian, Conservation Scientist with the British Columbia Provincial Museum, Canada. She also gave a lecture at the Forestry Commission of N. S. W. on Conservation of Aboriginal carved trees and Canadian totem poles. Dr. P. Casey presented information on fungi to the Australian Museum Conservation staff. A technical meeting on the topic of interlaboratory co-operation was attended at the conservation unit of the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences. The conservation facility at the Art Gallery of N. S. W. and the Nickleson Museum, University of Sydney, were viewed...|$|E
40|$|Em continuação a um artigo {{anterior}} (I), são apresentados os valores médios mensais das seguintes observaçõs: efeito do abrigo, temperaturas extremas, amplitude térmica diária, temperatura do solo, radiação global, velocidade do vento e déficit de saturação. O exame, dos gráficos e tabelas contidos no texto, mostra que: 1 - Enquanto em locais livremente expostos ao vento a diferença entre a temperatura lida dentro do abrigo tipo "Stevenson" e a obtida com o psicrômetro ventilado, só excepcionalmente tem significado estatístico, na mata as diferenças médias da ordem de 0, 5 ºC são comuns, em qualquer das horas de observação. 2 - As maiores médias das temperaturas máximas foram sempre as obtidas ao ar livre. Na mata elas são mais elevadas no vale e mais baixas no alto da elevação. 3 - As diferenças entre as temperaturas mínimas só são nítidas no inverno, quando em alguns pontos da mata elas são mais baixas e em outros mais altas do que as observadas ao ar livre. Nos meses mais frios a inversão noturna póde provocar, na mata, uma diferença médias de 3 ºC para um desnível de 100 m. 4 - A não ser no vale, onde foram registrados alguns valores médios iguais aos observados aos ar livre, a amplitude térmica diária é sempre menor na mata. 5 - A evolução da curva da temperatura do solo é influenciada pela situação topográfica e pela proteção oferecida pela vegetação. 6 - A atenuação da velocidade do vento é provocada principalmente pelas copas das árvores. Abaixo dess estrato, praticamente não foi registrada variação nos valores médios da velocidade do vento. 7 - Para o estudo do estado higrométrico do ar, dentro da mata, o déficit de saturação fornece melhors informações do que a umidade relativa. In sequence {{to a paper}} {{recently published}} (1), we present now the mean monthly values of the following observations: error caused by the screen of the Stevenson type in the measurements of the air temperature, extremes temperatures, range of temperature, soil temperature, global radiation, wind velocity and saturation deficit. The data analysed in the figures and tables of the text indicates that: 1 - The difference observed between the temperatures taken within the screen and that registered in the <b>sling</b> <b>psychrometer,</b> when in the open air, only occasionally have any statistical significance. In the forest however mean differences of 0. 5 ºC are frequent. 2 - The maximum means of the maximum temperatures were always those obtained in the open air. In the forest the means are higher in the valley and lower at the heights. 3 - The differences between the minimum temperatures are clear-cut only during the winter, when in several spots within the forest, are either lower or higher than {{those found in the}} open air. During the colder months, the nocturnal inversion can produce, in the forest, a mean difference of 3 ºC, for an altitude drop of 100 m. 4 - But for the valley where we sometimes registered mean values identical to those obtained in the open air, the range of temperature is always smaller in the forest. 5 - The variation of the soil temperature is conditioned by the topographical situation and the protection given by the vegetation. 6 - The attenuation of the wind is caused by the tuft of the trees. Below this layer we did not find significant variation in the mean values of the wind velocity. 7 - The saturation deficit can give more precise information about the air humidity in the forest than the relative humidity...|$|E
