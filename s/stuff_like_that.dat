500|$|Stephenson did {{extensive}} {{research on the}} Age of Enlightenment, noting that it is accessible for English speaking researchers because of the many well documented figures such as Leibniz, Newton and Samuel Pepys.

Especially prominent was the deification of Newton, Locke and Boyle and their scientific method by Enlightenment and Victorian scholars. [...] He considers the scientific work done during the Baroque period as crucial to the Enlightenment. From his research he concluded that the Enlightenment in general [...] "is and should be a controversial event because although it led to the flourishing of the sciences and political liberties and a lot of good <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> one can also argue that it {{played a role in the}} French Revolution and some of the negative events of the time as well."

500|$|The {{recording}} was {{fraught with}} tension between band members, as McCartney annoyed others by insisting on a perfect performance.

He {{spent the next two}} weeks with Ono and did not return to the studio until the backing track for [...] "Come Together" [...] was laid down on 21 July. Harrison was also tired of the song, adding [...] "we had to play {{it over and over again}} until Paul liked it. It was a real drag". Starr was more sympathetic to the song. [...] "It was granny music", he admitted, [...] "but we needed <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> on our album so other people would listen to it". Starr played the anvil sound in the chorus.

500|$|After {{turning down}} {{a number of}} record labels, the band signed to The Enclave, a record label run by A {{executive}} Tom Zutaut, who had previously signed Guns N' Roses to Geffen. Rootes felt that Zutaut was [...] "great. Very American, very cool, very into his artists." [...] Black Eye was recorded at Metropolis Studios in London and produced by punk rock veteran Bill Price, who had recorded albums by Sex Pistols and The Clash. The album was recorded live {{in the studio and}} the music was not arranged by the producer in order to achieve a rough, live sound. According to Rootes, Price [...] "just recorded us live while we were playing. We did things like putting different guitar tracks on top and <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> I did vocals at different times. But we really wanted to get a live sound." [...] The drums were recorded in a stone room using a basic kit that was modeled after a Ringo Starr reissue model, which resulted in a slightly distorted sound. The album was mastered by George Marino at Sterling Sound in New York City.|$|E
500|$|Construction of the {{monument}} began in 1848 with the excavation of the site, the laying of the cornerstone on the prepared bed, and laying the original foundation around {{and on top of}} the cornerstone, before the construction of its massive walls began the next year. Even though slave labor is not mentioned, no paid laborers whatsoever are listed among the small paid labor force of 21 used to construct the foundation in 1848, which included 14 stonemasons and 2 stonecutters. In contrast, the maximum work force during the second phase was 170, including 100 stonecutters, with laborers second in number. Washington Monument Historian John Steele Gordon stated [...] "I can’t say for certain, but the stonemasonry was pretty highly skilled, so it’s unlikely that slaves would’ve been doing it. The stones were cut by stonecutters, which is highly skilled work; and the stones were hoisted by means of steam engines, so you’d need a skilled engineer and foreman for <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> Tending the steam engine, building the cast-iron staircase inside — that wasn’t grunt work." [...] According to historian Jesse Holland, it is very likely that African-American slaves were among the construction workers, given that slavery prevailed in Washington and its surrounding states at that time, and slaves were commonly used in public and private construction.|$|E

Techno and rave was happening in the 90s and had a lot of different forms. There was very experimental, more hard <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> Aphex Twin.

Kahn said, [...] "...obviously, him going in there and dancing and turning into cars and trucks is right up my alley. His interests, in terms of kung fu and special effects and science fiction and all the boy-culture stuff, it falls directly in line with what I like. [...] "His talent is phenomenal. I'm still struggling to try and capture that talent on film, and it's a challenge. Here's a guy who can literally do anything. If you watch this thing, he's doing nunchuck tricks, and I'm a huge kung fu aficionado, and they're mind-blowing. I've never seen <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> before in kung fu flicks. I would say it's like a pure aesthetic dance video from the very fiber of it. Everything dances onscreen. Everything has movement. Everything has a certain mechanical rhythm. He actually created a dance style for this that is mechanical. It's sort of a hyper-intense version of the robot. Even the transformations go directly in line with the movements." ...|$|E
500|$|Songs {{from the}} album have been sampled {{frequently}} by hip hop producers and artists, including Black Moon, who sampled [...] "A Divine Image", and DJ Shadow, who sampled the luminous piano line from [...] "The Human Abstract" [...] on his 1996 song [...] "Midnight in a Perfect World". English hip hop producer Metabeats called Songs of Experience {{one of his}} favorite sources for sampling music and said of the album in an interview for Hip Hop Connection: [...] "You could sample everything on this record, and I think everyone already has. Axelrod is pretty much a sound library in himself – the quality is amazing." [...] American musician John McEntire ranked it third on his list of top-five albums and called it [...] "early crate-digger stuff. Great, funky rhythm-section playing, crazy, overblown string arrangements." [...] In a 2000 interview for The Wire, rapper and producer Mike Ladd spoke of the album recording [...] "London", deeming it [...] "crazy stuff" [...] that deviated from the one-dimensional rhythm loops of contemporary hip hop production. He went on the say, [...] "this is definitely the kind of stuff I'm planning to do for the next album, incorporate more fusion elements and <b>stuff</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> This is a really good production. I like it because it's little parts with gaps, which I don't normally have.
