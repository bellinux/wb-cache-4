40|$|Complementary {{resource}} use {{is regarded as}} a mechanism that contributes to positive relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Here, we used a biodiversity experiment composed of nine potentially dominant species (grasses: Alopecurus pratensis, Arrhenatherum elatius, Dactylis glomerata, Phleum pratense, Poa trivialis; legumes: Trifolium pratense, T repens; non-legume herbs: Anthriscus sylvestris, Geranium pratense) to test for differences among monocultures and mixtures and for effects of species richness and the presence of particular species on the use of aboveground space. The number of rooting shoots determined in a line transect increased from monocultures to mixtures. Particularly, the presence of A. elatius in mixtures caused a higher shoot density at the community level. The number of pin contacts per sampling point (cumulative cover) at the community level, analysed with the point intercept method, was higher in mixtures than monocultures, and higher in mixtures with than without A. elatius. The effect was attributable to increased densities across the strata of the vertical <b>stand</b> <b>profile</b> as well as to an increase in community height. The impact of species richness on the use of aboveground space differed considerably between individual species. A. elatius achieved increased densities across all strata of the <b>stand</b> <b>profile,</b> while D. glomerata reached higher densities with a more pronounced use of space in the upper strata with increasing species richness of mixtures. Cumulative cover of P. pratense and A. pratensis was not affected by species richness, while the remaining species decreased space use mostly in the upper strata with increasing species richness or in mixtures with the competitively superior A. elatius. Our study shows that potentially dominant species are limited in their ability for adaptive responses to canopy shading. Nevertheless, the differential responses to species richness of individual species with regard to vertical niche occupation resulted in positive diversity effects on aboveground space use at the community level.

40|$|TomoRadar is a helicopter/UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) based FM-CW {{microwave}} ranging radar {{designed for}} the forest inventory. Developed by FGI (Finnish Geospatial Research Institute), TomoRadar can scan forest with Ku-band signals and then receive the backscatter signal from targets. The target distance can be figured out from the backscattered signal. Furthermore, various information around forest can be evaluated. As a ranging scatterometer the system calibration and signal processing are necessary and critical tasks. In This thesis, these two major problems are researched and solved. The system calibration is limited to complete on ground and restricted in a particular range despite TomoRadar works on helicopter. Thus the range calibration experiment is conducted on the ground test field with a Luneburg lens. Besides, power calibration of system backscatter signal is researched through electrical component tests. The linearity of the radar system frequency sweep is critical in FM-CW radars. Hence, it is studied in this thesis. When TomoRadar works, {{the output of the}} whole system is analog signal in intimidate frequency (IF) band. A digitizer samples and records the output analog signal. With these signal, the information around forest cannot be obtained. To draw <b>stand</b> <b>profile</b> of forest and research forest information, the IF band signals need to be further processed. This is signal processing part of the thesis work. As a result of this thesis work, TomoRadar range calibration was achieved. The calibration results were verified by the helicopter based flying tests. The results present that the calibration completed on ground test field applied with the situation that TomoRadar works in air and scans targets in long distance. The linearity of system frequency sweep generated by DDS (Direct Digital Synthesizer) is verified. Finally, the test forest backscattered data was processed and the ranges were evaluated.

Istraživanjem je ustanovljeno stanje strukture, teksture i pomlađivanja u prašumskoj sastojini, koja se prostire na 80, 50 ha. Prašumsku sastojinu u prosjeku tvori 440 stabala po hektaru. Ukupni broj stabala opada s porastom prsnog promjera, a koeficijent (q) distribucije stabala po prsnim promjerima iznosi 1, 20. Volumen sastojine iznosi 671, 23 m 3 /ha, od čega je 52 % jele, 42 % otpada na bjelogoricu, a ostatak u iznosu od 6 % pripada volumenu smreke. Među tanjim stablima, čiji su prsni promjeri do 30 cm, kumulirano je 7, 55 % ukupnoga volumena. Na stablima sred­njih prsnih promjera između 31 i 50 cm kumulirano je 19, 92 % ukupnoga volumena sastojine. Ostatak volumena u iznosu od 72, 53 % kumuliran je na stablima velikih prsnih promjera iznad 50 cm. Ustanovljeno je postojanje razvojnih faza, ali na malim površinama, pa se može zaključiti o prebornom obliku sastojinskog sklopa. Po hektaru površine prašumske sastojine nalazi se u prosjeku deset odumrlih (suhih i trulih) stabala, od čega je sedam stabala obične jele. Ukupna brojnost mladoga naraštaja najveća je na lokalitetima na kojima je ustanovljena prijelazna inicijalna/preborna faza razvoja. Ti su lokaliteti najrjeđe zastupljeni po njezinoj površini. Po hektaru površine prašumske sastojine u prosjeku nalazimo 6190 biljaka pomlatka. Na jelu otpada 60 %, bukvu 28 %, smreku 2 %, a na gorski javor 10 % ukupnoga broja mladoga naraštaja. Not so {{very long}} ago (the end of the 19 th century) {{a large part of}} the Dinaric Mountain range in Croatia was covered by beech-fir and beech virgin forests. These forests have since been {{gradually}} converted into natural managed forests (Prpić et al. 2001). Nevertheless, several Dinaric beech-fir virgin forests have remained until the present day, including Čorkova Uvala, Devčića Tavani, Nadžak-Bilo, Plješivička Uvala, Javorov Kal and Štirovača (Prpić et al. 2001, Vukelić and Tomljanović 2001). Their total area amounts to 360 ha. The best investigated of these is Čorkova Uvala. The first scientific forest research in this forest dates back to 1957. Its structure has since been analyzed on several occasions: in a permanent sample plot of one hectare (Tikvić et al. 2006, 2004, Prpić and Seletković 1996, Prpić 1979, 1972), in 12 sample plots of 2, 500 m 2 each, systematically placed in the form of a network at a distance of 250 m from each other (Kramarić and Iuculano 1989) and in 153 sample plots, each sized 200 m 2 and systematically set up in the central part of the old growth stand in the form of a network 50 m from one another (Mayer et al. 1980). In addition, several inventories have also been conducted as part of the management program for the management unit of Čorkova Uvala (1987), and the structure of a wider area of Čorkova Uvala – Čudinka reserve has been analyzed (Cestar et al. 1983). Most of these investigations and inventories provide an average picture of the old growth stand structure. Apart from the results of Mayer et al. (1980), there have been no in-depth analyses of its structure and regeneration. More recently, research into natural regeneration in the old growth stand of Čorkova Uvala has been intensified and initial results have been published (Roženberger et al. 2007). This work presents the results of initial comparative research into the structure, texture and regeneration in the old growth stand of Čorkova Uvala. This research was undertaken in the Dinaric beech-fir virgin forest of Čorkova Uvala in Plitvice Lakes National Park in the period 2004 – 2005. The research involved a systematic sample of 68 plots of 805 m 2 each. The plots, set up in the form of a network, were placed 100 m from one another. The activities in each plot included measuring the terrain slope, describing the relief, assessing the canopy, identifying life stages of the virgin forest, measuring breast diameters on all trees (d 1. 30 > 3 cm) and classifying them by tree species. Dead trees were recorded separately. A height sample was measured in the plots and in their immediate proximity. The young growth was measured in each plot over an area of 80 m 2 and classified by tree species and height. Research provided the condition of the structure, texture and regeneration in the old growth stand extending over 80. 50 ha. The old growth stand is made up of 440 trees per hectare on average. Common beech and other hardwoods (OHW) account for almost half of the trees (49 %). There are 45 % of fir trees (Abies alba Mill.) and 6 % of common spruces (Picea abies Karst.). The total tree number declines with an increase in breast diameters. The coefficient (q) of tree distribution by breast diameter is 1. 20. Stand volume is 671. 23 m 2 /ha, of which fir accounts for 52 %, broadleaves account for 42 %, and the remaining 6 % relates to spruce. 7. 55 % of the total volume is accumulated among thinner trees with breast diameters up to 30 cm. Trees with mean breast diameters between 31 and 50 cm contain 19. 92 % of the total stand volume. The remaining volume of 72. 53 % is accumulated on trees with breast diameters above 50 cm. Different developmental stages have been identified, albeit over small areas, allowing us to conclude that the <b>stand</b> <b>profile</b> has the selection form. The initial developmental stage was determined in 9 % of the cases, the optimal stage in 18 % of the cases, the terminal stage in 65 % of the cases (ageing and decomposition), and the typical selection developmental stage in 8 % of the cases. The late optimal stage and the ageing stage are the most common due to the depression-like relief of Čorkova Uvala, which protects it from severe winds and allows mature and dead trees to remain standing for long periods. The decomposition stage occurs over small areas as a consequence of fall of singe trees or small groups of trees. In the area of the old growth stand the typical initial stage is relatively modest. It occurs in gaps but also under the canopy. The typical selection stage was found in the smallest number of cases. It is the densest (548 trees/ha), with a volume of 434. 70 m 3 /ha and the highest participation of the silver fir. There are on average ten dead (dry and rotten) trees per one hectare of the old growth stand, of which seven are trees of silver fir. The highest number of dead fir trees was recorded in the 11 – 20 cm diameter class. The total abundance of the young growth was found in the localities in which a transitional initial/selection developmental stage was recorded. These localities are the least represented. There are 6, 190 seedlings on average per one hectare of the old growth stand. Fir accounts for 60 %, beech for 28 %, spruce for 2 % and sycamore for 10 % of the total number of the young growth. Two thirds of the seedlings are up to 50 cm tall. On average, a fir taller than 50 cm is found on every 12 m 2 of the area and one taller than 100 cm on every 30 m 2 of the area. Unlike beech and sycamore, no fir taller than 300 cm was found up to the taxation limit. Of the total number of the young growth up to 100 cm in height, beech accounts for 15 %, spruce for 2 % and sycamore for 9 %. Beech and sycamore prevail in height classes above 100 cm. The young growth of spruce has a secondary role and occurs sporadically, reaching a height of up to 175 cm...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Abstract Quantifying {{vertical}} and horizontal stand structure using terrestrial LiDAR in Pacific Northwest forests Alexandra Kazakova Chair of Supervisory Committee: Dr. L. Monika Moskal School of Environmental and Forest Science Stand level spatial distribution is a fundamental part of forest structure that influences many ecological processes and ecosystem functions. Vertical and horizontal spatial structure provides key information for forest management. Although horizontal stand complexity can be measured through stem mapping and spatial analysis, vertical complexity within the stand remains a mostly visual and highly subjective process. Tools and techniques in remote sensing, specifically LiDAR, provide three dimensional datasets that can help get at three dimensional forest stand structure. Although aerial LiDAR (ALS) is the most widespread form of remote sensing for measuring forest structure, it has a high omission rate in dense and structurally complex forests. In this study we used terrestrial LiDAR (TLS) to obtain high resolution three dimensional point clouds of plots from stands that vary by density and composition in the second-growth Pacific Northwest forest ecosystem. We used point cloud slicing techniques and object-based image analysis (OBIA) to produce canopy profiles at multiple points of vertical gradient. At each height point we produced segments that represented canopies or parts of canopies for each tree within the dataset. The resulting canopy segments were further analyzed using landscape metrics to quantify vertical canopy complexity within a single stand. Based on the developed method, we have successfully created a tool that utilizes three dimensional spatial information to accurately quantify the vertical structure of forest stands. Results show {{significant differences in the}} number and the total area of the canopy segments and gap fraction between each vertical slice within and between individual forest management plots. We found a significant relationship between the stand density and composition and the vertical canopy complexity. The methods described in this research make it possible to create horizontal <b>stand</b> <b>profiles</b> at any point along the vertical gradient of forest stands with high frequency, therefore providing ecologists with measures of horizontal and vertical stand structure.

The portable ground-based synthetic aperture radar (GB-SAR) system was used to capture profiles of the vertical polarimetric backscattering patterns through a ∼ 7 m tall stand of Norway spruce trees. The TP scheme collects data as for normal SAR imaging, but with the antennae aligned in the along-track direction. Adaptive post-processing meant that each TP scan simultaneously captured along-track image transects over the incidence angle range 0 °– 60 °. An important feature of the derived image products is that incidence angle is constant at every point within an image. The measured HH–VV height backscatter profiles were very similar, whilst the cross-/co-polarization ratio showed very little variation with height through the <b>stand.</b> Backscattering <b>profiles</b> showed closest agreement with the branch biomass distribution through the canopy, rather than with trunk or branch + trunk biomasses. Equivalent interferometric tree heights were estimated from the centre of mass of the backscatter-height distribution, which displayed increasing height with increasing incidence angle.

The perforated tape samples tension strength is noticed in the amplitude of 168 to 921 MPa, compressive strength of <b>profiles</b> <b>stands</b> - 350 MPa, but surface hardness in the amplitude of 830 to 3030 MPa. it is proved that tape by its physically - mechanical and esthetical features can be effectively used as a design element, reinforcing and constructive metarial in the construction processes. Effective solutions for use of perforated steel tape are form elements, reinforcing in reinforced concrete constructions and brick masonry, floor spacers, elements of wall constructions and other construction load-bearing elements...|$|R
