40|$|Detailed {{studies of}} {{earthquakes}} {{triggered by a}} known source of stress change can {{shed light on the}} influence of fault frictional properties and preseismic stress on the initiation, propagation and arrest of seismic ruptures. Triggered and induced seismicity can provide unique opportunities to understand this problem. However, direct evidence is rare due to the absence of e. g., near-field surface ground deformation observations and unknown pre-earthquake stress conditions. Here, we collect geodetic data recording the coseismic effects of the Mw 5. 1, 11 May 2011 Lorca (SE Spain) moderate earthquake. Elastic modelling results suggest that the nucleation process and main slip area occurred at very shallow depths (2 - 4 km) on the rupture plane along the Alhama de Murcia fault. Slip extends towards the surface from unstable to stable friction fault segments. We find that the <b>slip</b> area <b>matches</b> well a pattern of positive Coulomb stress change due to groundwater extraction in a nearby basin aquifer. These results indicate that the shallow slip distribution during the earthquake could be controlled by groundwater induced unloading stresses at the upper frictional transition of the seismogenic layer. The relationship between known crustal stress changes (e. g., groundwater extraction) and coseismic slip distribution could help, in general, to understand where and how earthquakes tend to occur...|$|R

30|$|Assuming {{that the}} source of the Oita {{earthquake}} is similar to that in the reference model and that the stress changes caused by the Mw 7.0 Kumamoto earthquake contributed to the occurrence of the Oita earthquake, the following scenario may describe the physical process of triggering. Frictional stress transiently increased by about 0.7  MPa because of the Kumamoto earthquake, about one order of magnitude less than the stress drop of a typical earthquake, but enough to exceed the frictional strength required to trigger an earthquake on the generating fault. The large transient stress change required for triggering may suggest that the background stress difference was relatively low. On the other hand, this fault was closer to failure than other faults in this region, because there were no triggered earthquakes on the other faults. Although the relationship between triggering stress and triggered event magnitude has been thoroughly investigated only for tectonic tremors (e.g., Miyazawa and Mori 2006; Miyazawa and Brodsky 2008), there have been case studies that suggest earthquakes of M >  4 can be triggered by large transient stress changes. For example, the 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake remotely and dynamically triggered M ~ 4 earthquakes at Hakone volcano, Japan, with triggering stresses of ~ 100  kPa, a location where no earthquake of M >  4.0 had been recorded since 1995 (Yukutake et al. 2011, 2013). In the present case, too, large stress changes on the fault are thought to have directly triggered the large earthquake. Parsons et al. (2012) used simulated wavefields to show that dynamic stress changes from surface waves rarely trigger M >  5 earthquakes and concluded that there is an inconsistency between target fault rake and imposed stress change direction and that the window in which the dynamic stress field change favors triggering is temporally short and spatially small. In the present case, because the rake of the imposed <b>slip</b> <b>matched</b> the rake of the triggered fault, and because the resolved triggering stress was sufficiently large, it might have been easy for a rupture to propagate in the favorable direction. Stress transfer from the Oita earthquake then triggered aftershocks to an extent, but seismicity abruptly returned to background levels within a month. Since aftershocks are in general triggered by stress changes caused by the mainshock, this may indicate that the static stress changes caused by the Oita earthquake could not have remarkably exceeded the triggering threshold with a low background stress difference. These observations suggest the following: (1) The fault of the Oita earthquake was not originally close to failure {{at the time of the}} Kumamoto earthquake, but the large transient stress changes from the Kumamoto earthquake triggered the Oita earthquake and/or (2) the apparent quiescence of aftershocks following the Oita earthquake is temporary, and eventually there will be significant seismicity.|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{applications}} of bubble plumes require experimental data for bubbles smaller than one millimeter in diameter. It {{is difficult to}} obtain {{a steady flow of}} bubbles this small in the laboratory, so this study investigates the use of negatively buoyant sediment plumes to model positively buoyant bubble plumes. This procedure benefits from the ease with which sediment is measured, obtained and stored at any desired diameter. In trials comparing sediment and bubbles of the same terminal and slip velocity, in plumes with equal and opposite buoyancy fluxes, sediment is shown to be a good model for air bubbles to determine plume peeling heights in stratified environments. Within margins of experimental repeatability, the bubble plumes and sediment plumes peel at the same distance from their starting points. Further experiments with smaller sediment provide data that is used to generate a graph for determining plume peeling heights; the normalized plume peeling height is found to decrease with increasing sediment size. This normalized curve can applied to bubble plumes by <b>matching</b> <b>slip</b> and terminal velocities. A negatively buoyant liqui...|$|R

Regional detrital zircon provenance demonstrates that sediment routing systems were disconnected in the eastern and western Bight Basin, negating terrestrial transport mechanisms as a possible vector of the zircons from the SLIP to their recovered position. Palynology indicates that the 106 Ma zircons are syn-depositional, and we interpret them as being significantly transported in an eruption plume.

The coseismic and postseismic slip distributions are inverted simultaneously using principal component analysis-based inversion method (PCAIM). Exploring a wide range of boundary conditions and regularization constraints, we found the coseismic slip distribution to be quite compact with a peak slip between 30 and 50 m near the trench. Our model shows deep afterslip fringing the downdip edge of the coseismic rupture but also a dominant zone of shallow afterslip. Afterslip over the first 279 days following the main shock represents about 40 % of the coseismic moment. We compare the coseismic and postseismic models with an interseismic coupling model derived from inland and sea bottom measurements determined in a self-consistent manner. Assuming that seismic and aseismic <b>slip</b> had to <b>match</b> the long-term <b>slip</b> rate along the megathrust, the recurrence time of Mw 9. 0 earthquakes is estimated to 100 - 300 years, while historical and paleotsunami records suggest a return period more of the order of 1000 years.

40|$|The Amuri Earthquake of September 1, 1888 (magnitude M = 6. 5 to 6. 8) {{occurred}} on the Hope River Segment of the Hope Fault west of Hanmer Plains. The earthquake was felt strongly in North Canterbury and North Westland and caused considerable property damage and landsliding in the Lower Hope Valley. However, damage reports and the spatial distribution of felt intensities emphasize extreme variations in seismic effects over short distances, probably due to topographic focusing and local ground conditions. Significant variations in lateral fault displacement occurred at secondary fault segment boundaries (side-steps and bends in the fault trace) during the 1888 earthquake. This historical spatial variation in lateral <b>slip</b> is <b>matched</b> by the Late Quaternary geomorphic distribution of slip on the Hope River Segment of the Hope Fault. Trenching studies at two sites on the Hope Fault have also identified evidence for five pre-historic earthquakes of similar magnitude to the 1888 earthquake and an average recurrence interval of 134 ± 27 years between events. Magnitude estimates for the 1888 earthquake are combined with a. strong ground motion attenuation expression to provide an estimate of potential ground accelerations in Amuri District during-future earthquakes on the Hope River Segment of the Hope Fault. The predicted acceleration response on bedrock sites within 20 km of the epicentral region is between 0. 23 g and 0. 34 g. The close match between the historic, inferred pre-historic and geomorphic distribution of lateral slip indicates that secondary fault segmentation exerts a strong structural control on rupture propagation and the expression of fault displacement at the surface. In basement rocks at depth the spatial variations in slip are inferred to be distributed within zones of pervasive cataclastic shear, {{on either side of}} the fault segment boundaries. The large variations in surface displacement across fault segment boundaries means that one must know the geometry of the fault in order to evaluate slip-rates calculated from individual locations. The average Late Quaternary slip-rate on the Hope Fault at Glynn Wye Station is between 15. 5 mm/yr and 18. 25 mm/yr and the rate on the subsidiary Kakapo Fault is between 5. 0 mm/yr and 7. 5 mm/yr.

Here we assess the accuracy the Maxwell, Epstein, and Cercignani-Lampis BCs, by comparing numerical results of the Boltzmann equation for the Lennard-Jones potential to experimental data on Poiseuille and thermal transpiration flows. The four experiments considered are: Ewart et al. [J. Fluid Mech. 584, 337 - 356 (2007) ], Rojas-C ́ardenas et al. [Phys. Fluids, 25, 072002 (2013) ], and Yam- aguchi et al. [J.

40|$|We present fault {{slip rate}} {{estimates}} for Southern California based on Global Positioning System (GPS) velocity {{data from the}} University NAVSTAR Consortium (UNAVCO), the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC), and new campaign GPS velocity data from the San Bernardino Mountains and vicinity. Fault slip-rates were calculated using Tdefnode, a program used to model elastic deformation within lithospheric blocks and slip on block bounding faults [2]. Our block model comprised most major faults within Southern California. Tdefnode produced similar slip rate values as other geodetic modeling techniques. The fastest slipping faults are the Imperial fault (37. 4 ± 0. 1 mm/yr) and the Brawley seismic zone (23. 5 ± 0. 1 mm/yr) in the SW section of the San Andreas fault (SAF). The slip rate of the SAF decreases northwestward from 18. 7 ± 0. 2 mm/yr in Coachella Valley to 6. 6 ± 0. 2 mm/yr along the Banning/Garnet Hill sections, as slip transfers northward into the Eastern California Shear zone. North of the junction with the San Jacinto fault (10. 5 ± 0. 2 mm/yr), the San Andreas fault slip rate increases to 14. 2 ± 0. 1 mm/yr in the Mojave section. Tdefnode <b>slip</b> rate estimates <b>match</b> well with geologic estimates for SAF (Coachella), SAF (San Gorgonio Pass), San Jacinto, Elsinore, and Whittier faults, but not so well for other faults. We determine that the northwest and Southeast sections of the SAF are slipping fastest with slip being partitioned over several faults in the central model area. In addition, our modeling technique produces similar results to other geodetic studies but deviated from geologic estimates. We conclude that Tdefnode is a viable modeling technique in this context and at the undergraduate level...|$|R

The inland extent of deposits from past tsunamis (paleodeposits) {{can be used in}} tsunami modeling to reveal characteristics of the source earthquake, but these deposits may have undergone taphonomic processes since initial deposition. Therefore, to determine how tsunami deposits change during burial and preservation and the potential limitations of using paleodeposits in modeling, I investigated the modern 2010 Mw 8. 8 Maule earthquake and tsunami as a detailed case study. I used GeoClaw numerical modeling to compare simulated tsunamis from published co-seismic slip distributions of the earthquake with observations from post-tsunami surveys and modified these distributions to determine the most important tsunami-forming characteristics of the earthquake. To investigate taphonomic changes of the deposits, in 2015 I resurveyed the 2010 deposits where they had been previously described and related these findings to modeling results. The majority of simulated results of the 2010 tsunami underestimated the observed field data, with the most successful simulation created by a published <b>slip</b> distribution that <b>matched</b> observations at 5 of the 6 study sites. My most successful modified slip distribution did not improve this match (4 / 6 sites), and had an earthquake magnitude that was too large. The errors in modeling derived from using coarse resolution bathymetry and topography were likely the main reason for under-performing simulations, although a combination of other error sources could also play a role. The tsunami deposits at all study sites were altered by taphonomic processes since 2010, but were still recognizable, indicating moderate preservation. Changes in the deposit inland extent from 2010 - 2015 at two sites ranged from - 6 % to + 24 %. Deposit thickness was better preserved than the internal structures, therefore most deposits will likely be preserved in the long-term. Combined, the results of my modeling and sediment studies indicate that GeoClaw modeling based on preserved paleotsunami deposits could provide useful estimates of tsunami-generating earthquake characteristics in south-central Chile, provided better resolution bathymetry and topography are available...|$|R
