25|$|The {{northern}} whiting, Sillago sihama (also {{known as}} the silver whiting and <b>sand</b> <b>smelt),</b> is a marine fish, the most widespread and abundant member of the smelt-whiting family Sillaginidae. The northern whiting was the first species of sillaginid scientifically described and is therefore the type species of both the family Sillaginidae and the genus Sillago. The species is distributed in the Indo-Pacific region from South Africa {{in the west to}} Japan and Indonesia in the east, also becoming an invasive species to the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal. The northern whiting inhabits coastal areas to 60 m, but is most often found in shallow water around bays and estuaries, often entering freshwater. It is a carnivore, taking a variety of polychaetes and crustaceans. The species is of major economic importance throughout the Indo-Pacific. It is most frequently taken by seine nets and cast nets and marketed fresh.|$|E

Our results suggest that negative NAO conditions in the Atlantic Ocean, often associated with rougher sea conditions (greater vertical mixing, stronger winds and lower SST) were related with earlier breeding, and lower SST in the surroundings of the colony during winterespring favour the abundance of prey fish for Little Terns as well as their reproductive parameters.

The species was subsequently placed in the genus Platycephalus, before its true identity as a new genus was realized and Sillago was created in 1816. This was the first description and naming of any smelt-whiting, even though the author initially placed the species in the wrong genus. This makes S. sihama the type species of its genus, Sillago, {{as well as the}} type species of the family Sillaginidae, which was not to be named until 1846. However, Forsskål's name {{was not the only one}} applied to the species, with three other names given to the fish after the first correct naming. Two of these, S. acuta and S. erythraea were made by Georges Cuvier, and the other, Sciaena malabarica by Bloch and Schneider.

50|$|The Short-beaked garfish (Belone svetovidovi) is an {{uncommon}} species of needlefish {{in marine waters}} of the Eastern Atlantic ocean. It is a pelagic needlefish that is present in Ireland, Spain, Portugal, and the United Kingdom. It is possible Belone svetovidovi is thriving in the Mediterranean Sea as well. This species {{was thought to be}} the same as the Garfish (Belone belone) because they share the same waters. Belone svetovidovi matures at 30 cm (12 in) and can grow to a maximum of 65 cm (26 in) while Belone belone can be 95 cm (38 in). Like all needlefish, this one has an elongated body with beak-like jaws that are lined with razor sharp teeth. The Short-beaked garfishs' lower jaw is longer than the upper. Its body is silvery like most needlefish and has a black stripe running across its lateral line. The dorsal and anal fins are very close to the caudal peduncle. These fish are Oviparous. Eggs may be found attached to objects in the water by tendrils on the egg's surface. They are spherical eggs that are dispersed on the sea floor (demersal). There is not much known about this fish's feeding habits, or anything about this fish for that matter. It is likely it preys on small ocean going fish. It has been caught using mackerel before. Needlefish tend to be towards the surface so fish such as Atlantic Mackerel, European pilchard, <b>Sand</b> <b>smelt</b> etc. would be preyed on. The Short-beaked garfish is likely distributed in these countries: Algeria, Cyprus, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom.|$|E

40|$|The estuarine {{environment}} {{is an important}} transition and nursery area for juvenile chinook and other salmonid smolts (Healy 1980 a). The limited number of studies to determine distribution and habitat utili-zation of juvenile salmonids in Puget Sound indicate that juvenile salmon are dependent upon the intertidal and shallow subtidal for feeding, refuge and migration corridors. To enhance our understanding of salmonid distribution and habitat utilization in King County, the Central Puget Sound Forum sponsored a beach seining pilot study that concentrated on sampling logistics, presence/absence of juvenile chinook in the nearshore environment, and development of a nearshore fish catch baseline. Beach seining was conducted weekly at six locations throughout the study area from June 5 to August 16, 2000. Each site was only sampled during daylight hours, but there was temporal and spatial variability due to natural tidal cycles, and sampling times during the study period. Chinook smolts were the most abundant salmonid encountered. Coho, sockeye, chum, steelhead and cut-throat trout juveniles were found in smaller numbers. Preliminary analyses indicate that tide stage {{did not seem to}} affect the total catch of salmonid species. However, additional sampling and a comparative analysis are warranted.

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier and can be found at: [URL] conditions can greatly impact lower trophic level prey assemblages in marine ecosystems, with effects of ocean state propagating to higher trophic levels. In many regions throughout their range, common murre (Uria aalge) exhibit narrow dietary breadth in feeding chicks and therefore are vulnerable to recruitment failures of dominant prey species during the breeding season. Contrastingly, common murres nesting in the northern California Current off Oregon, exhibit high species diversity and variability in dominant prey consumed. We studied the diets of common murres over 10 years between 1998 and 2011, a period in which the northern California Current experienced dramatic interannual variability in ocean conditions. Likewise, murre diets off Oregon varied considerably. Interannual variation in murre chick diets was influenced by environmental drivers occurring before and during the breeding season, and at both basin and local scales. While clupeids (likely Pacific herring, Clupea pallasii) were an important diet component throughout the study period, in some years murre diets were dominated by Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) and in other years by osmerids (likely whitebait smelt, Allosmerus elongatus and surf smelt, Hypomesus pretiosus). Years in which the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and local sea surface temperatures were higher during summer also showed elevated levels of clupeids in murre diets, while years with higher North Pacific Gyre Oscillation index values and greater local winter ichthyoplankton biomass had fewer clupeids and more <b>sand</b> lance or <b>smelts.</b> Years with higher values of the Northern Oscillation Index during summer and an earlier spring transition showed higher proportion of smelts in the diets.

40|$|Locally and globally, {{there is}} growing {{recognition}} of the critical roles that herring, <b>smelt,</b> <b>sand</b> lance, eulachon, and other forage fishes play in marine ecosystems. Scientific and resource management entities throughout the Salish Sea, agree that extensive information gaps exist, both in basic biological knowledge and parameters critical to fishery management. Communication and collaboration among researchers also is inadequate. Building on the interest and enthusiasm generated by recent forage fish workshops and symposia around the region, the 2012 Research Symposium on the Conservation and Ecology of Marine Forage Fishes was designed to elucidate practical recommendations for science and policy needs and actions, and spur further collaboration in support for the precautionary management of forage fish. This dynamic and productive event was a joint venture of the Northwest Straits Commission Forage Fish Program, U. S. Geological Survey (USGS), Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), and The Puget Sound Partnership. The symposium was held on September 12 – 14, 2012, at the University of Washington, Friday Harbor Laboratories campus. Sixty scientists, graduate students, and fisheries policy experts convened; showcasing ongoing research, conservation, and management efforts targeting forage fish from regional and national perspectives. The primary objectives of this event were to: (1) review current research and management related to marine forage fish species; and (2) identify priority science and policy needs and actions for Washington, British Columbia, and the entire West Coast. Given the diversity of knowledge, interests, and disciplines surrounding forage fish {{on both sides of}} the international border, the organizing committee made a concerted effort to contact many additional experts who, although unable to attend, provided valuable insights and ideas to the symposium structure and discussions. The value of the symposium format was highlighted in the closing remarks delivered by Joseph Gaydos, SeaDoc Society and Chair of the Puget Sound Science Panel. Dr. Gaydos’ presentation referenced the 2011 paper by Murray Rudd in the journal Conservation Biology, “How research-prioritization exercises affect conservation policy. ” The paper points out that policy makers and funding agencies are more likely to gain a full understanding of issues when they are presented with research findings from an aligned research program.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Variable ocean {{conditions}} can greatly impact lower trophic level prey assemblages in marine ecosystems, with effects propagating up to higher trophic levels. Our {{goal was to}} better understand how varying ocean conditions influence diets and niche overlap among a suite of low- to mid trophic level predators. We studied the diets of common murres (Uria aalge) over 10 contrasting years between 1998 and 2011, {{a period in which}} the Northern California Current experienced dramatic interannual variability in ocean conditions. Likewise, murre diets off Oregon varied considerably. Interannual variation in murre chick diets appears to be influenced by environmental drivers occurring before and during the breeding season, at both basin and local spatial scales. While clupeids were an important diet component throughout the study period, in some years murre diets were dominated by Pacific sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus) and other years by osmerids (likely Allosmerus elongatus and Hypomesus pretiosus). Years in which the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and local sea surface temperatures were above average during summer months also showed elevated levels of clupeids in murre diets, while years with higher winter ichthyoplankton biomass and summer northern copepod biomass anomalies had fewer clupeids and more <b>sand</b> lance and <b>smelts.</b> Years with higher Northern Oscillation Index values during summer months also showed more smelts in the murre diets. Nesting phenology and reproductive success were correlated with diet as well, reflecting demographic consequences of environmental variability mediated through bottom-up food web dynamics. To examine niche overlap between murres and other marine predators we employed collaborative fisheries research with synoptic observations of a major seabird colony to determine the diets of four predator species on the central Oregon coast during two years of contrasting El Niño (2010) vs. La Niña (2011) conditions. The greatest degree of dietary overlap was observed between Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and common murres, with both smelts (Osmeridae) and clupeids (primarily Clupea pallasii) observed as the dominant prey types. Diets differed between El Niño and La Niña conditions for two predators, murres and black rockfish (Sebastes melanops). During La Niña, <b>smelts</b> decreased, while <b>sand</b> lance increased in common murre diets. Black rockfish had fewer larval Dungeness crabs (Cancer magister) and a greater proportion of crab species associated with the later spring transition. Chinook salmon and Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) diets were similar during El Niño and La Niña conditions. These findings underscore that the diets of common murres during chick rearing reflect local- and basin-scale biophysical processes in the Northern California Current, and are valuable for understanding the response of upper trophic level organisms to changing oceanographic conditions. Additionally, using multiple predators across several diverse taxa to track changes in prey communities provided a way to detect seemingly subtle changes in prey communities and contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of food web dynamics and ecosystem indicators...|$|R
