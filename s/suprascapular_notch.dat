40|$|Abstract Introduction Suprascapular nerve {{neuropathy}} {{constitutes an}} unusual cause of shoulder weakness, {{with the most}} common etiology being nerve compression from a ganglion cyst at the <b>suprascapular</b> or spinoglenoid <b>notch.</b> We present a puzzling case {{of a man with}} suprascapular nerve neuropathy that may have been associated with an appendectomy. The case was attributed to nerve injury as the most likely cause that may have occurred during improper post-operative patient mobilization. Case presentation A 23 -year-old Caucasian man presented to an orthopedic surgeon with a history of left shoulder weakness of several weeks' duration. The patient complained of pain and inability to lift minimal weight, such as a glass of water, following an appendectomy. His orthopedic clinical examination revealed obvious atrophy of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles and 2 of 5 muscle strength scores on flexion resistance and external rotation resistance. Magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse high signal intensity within the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles and early signs of minimal fatty infiltration consistent with denervation changes. No compression of the suprascapular nerve in the <b>suprascapular</b> or spinoglenoid <b>notch</b> was noted. Electromyographic studies showed active denervation effects in the supraspinatus muscle and more prominent in the left infraspinatus muscle. The findings were compatible with damage to the suprascapular nerve, especially the part supplying the infraspinatus muscle. On the basis of the patient's history, clinical examination, and imaging studies, the diagnosis was suspected to be associated with a possible traction injury of the suprascapular nerve that could have occurred during the patient's transfer from the operating table following an appendectomy. Conclusion Our case report may provide important insight into patient transfer techniques used by hospital personnel, may elucidate the clinical significance of careful movement of patients following general anesthesia, and may have important implications for patient safety techniques, including those outlined in the World Health Organization Surgical Safety Checklist program. </p...|$|R
50|$|Suprascapular artery {{and nerve}} are {{found within the}} fossa. The {{posterior}} branch of the suprascapular artery supplies the supraspinatous muscle. Dorsal scapular artery also gives off a collateral branch and anastomoses with the suprascapular artery. Suprascapular nerve from the brachial plexus passes through the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> as it approaches the fossa to supply the supraspinatus muscle. Suprascapular artery and nerve descend together but are separated by the superior transverse scapular ligament at the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>supra{{scapular}}</b> <b>notch</b> (or scapular notch) is a notch in {{the superior}} {{border of the}} scapula, just medial {{to the base of}} the coracoid process.|$|E
5000|$|The suprascapular nerve {{arises from}} the upper trunk of the brachial plexus which is formed by the union of the ventral rami of the fifth and sixth {{cervical}} nerves. After branching from the upper trunk, the nerve passes across the posterior triangle of the neck parallel to the inferior belly of the omohyoid muscle and deep to the trapezius muscle. It then runs along the superior border of the scapula, passes through the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> inferior to the superior transverse scapular ligament and enters the supraspinous fossa. It then passes beneath the supraspinatus, and curves around the lateral border of {{the spine of the}} scapula to the infraspinous fossa.|$|E
40|$|The <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> {{which is}} located on the lateral part of the {{superior}} border of the scapula, medial to the coracoid process, is bridged by the superior transverse scapular ligament.

40|$|Abstract: Background: The <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> is {{a common}} feature of {{superior}} border of the scapula, near the coracoid process. Superior transverse scapular ligament is a band like fibrous structure that converts the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> into a foramen through which the suprascapular nerve passes, whereas the suprascapular vessels goes above the ligament. Some times this <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> is absent. Its absence along with different variations of superior transverse scapular ligament may results in suprascapular nerve entrapment neuropathy. This syndrome is characterized by vague pain on the posterolateral aspect of shoulder and atrophy of supraspinatus & infraspinatus muscles. The patients also complain about weakness of external rotation and abduction of arm. The knowledge about the variations along {{the course of the}} nerve is important in understanding the source of the entrapment syndrome. Aims & Objectives: To study the incidence of complete absence of <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> in Indian population & compare it with incidences in various races of world. Materials & Methods: The present study carried out on 220 (Right- 108, Left- 112) dried human scapulae of unknown sex and age for presence or absence of the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> on superior border of scapula. RESULTS: Scapulae without <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> are found in 34 among 220 scapulae (15. 46 %), in which 15 (6. 82 %) belongs to right side & 19 (8. 64 %) to left side. Conclusion: The incidence of complete absence of <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> in our study suggest {{that it is not a}} rare finding. So, every practicing physician & surgeon should always consider its role in suprascapular nerve entrapment neuropathy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{superior}} {{margin of}} the scapula is thin and sharp and is the shortest of the three. It is interrupted by the scapular notch, which lies {{very close to the}} root of the coracoid process. This notch is bridged by the superior transverse scapular ligament, thus converting it into a foramen. The shape of the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> is one of the important predisposing factor for the suprascapular nerve entrapment. The present study was done by observing 112 human dried scapulae. Type IV was the most common type with 40 (35. 71 %) scapulae, whereas type V was the least observed type with just two (1. 79 %) scapulae. The reason for the different shape of <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> can be probably explained from the point of ossification of corocoid process and other bony parts in and around the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch.</b> Knowledge of <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> variations may be essential for surgeons performing SN decompression, especially by means of endoscopic techniques...|$|E
40|$|Suprascapular nerve {{entrapment}} syndrome (SNES) is a neuropathy caused by compression of the nerve along its course. The most common compression sites include the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> and the spinoglenoid notch. The {{aim of this}} article was to review the anatomical factors influencing the occurrence of SNES {{in the light of the}} newest reports. Potential predisposing morphological factors include a V-shaped, narrow, or “deep” suprascapular notch; a band-shaped, bifurcated, or completely ossified superior transverse scapular ligament (STSL); particular arrangements of the suprascapular nerve and vessels at the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch.</b> A very recent report indicates structures at the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> region that may protect from SNES, such as the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> veins (SNV). The role of the anterior coracoscapular ligament (ACSL) is still not clear. While some studies indicate that it may predispose for SNES, the newest study proposes a protective function. Knowledge of these variations is essential for arthroscopic and other surgical procedures of this area in order to avoid iatrogenic injury of the suprascapular nerve or unexpected bleeding from the suprascapular vessels running alongside the STSL...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionNerve can be {{compressed}} {{when traveling}} through any osteo-fibrous tunnel. Any eventual anatomic structure limiting this passage {{increases the risk of}} neuropathy. During dissection of the shoulder region we recognized a vein travelling on the inferior border of the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> together with the suprascapular nerve. The aim of this work was to evaluate the morphological characteristics of this vein in cadaveric material. Materials and methodsThe <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> (SSN) region was dissected in 60 cadaveric shoulders. The course, number and diameter of nerve and vessels in the suprascapluar notch region were evaluated. Length, proximal and distal width of the superior transverse scapular ligament were measured. Photographic documentation was taken to evaluate the suprascapular nerve passage area. ResultsThe vein identified was named as the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> vein. It was present in 58. 3 % of shoulders. In 11 specimens, it was double. Its mean diameter was 1. 7 mm (SD 0. 7 mm) and did not correlate with the suprascapular nerve passage area. A <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> vein co-occurred more often with the anterior coracoscapular ligament (ACSL). In comparison with the SSN without the ACSL, it has a significantly greater diameter (2 mm; SD 0. 7 mm vs 1. 5 mm; SD 0. 6 mm, respectively; P= 0. 021). ConclusionsThe <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> vein was a common structure that did not replace the suprascapular vein. Its presence correlated with the occurrence of the ACSL and was independent of body side, STSL type and SSN type. Type of studyObservational anatomic study...|$|E
40|$|Evaluation of the {{morphology}} of the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> {{region is}} important from a clinical {{point of view}} {{because it is the}} most common site of suprascapular nerve compression and injury. A group of 120 patients underwent ultrasound examination of the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> region according to our original four-stage “step-by-step” protocol. The notches were classified based on their morphology and measurements like maximal depth (MD) and superior transverse diameter (STD) as follows: type I-MD is longer than STD, type II-MD and STD are equal, type III-STD is longer than MD, and in type IV/V-notches only the bony margin was visualized without depression. Both suprascapular notches were fully visualized in 115 of 120 patients. The type III <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> was the most prevalent (64. 2 %), followed by type IV/V (18. 7 %), type I (11. 1 %), and type II (6. 0 %). Color Doppler analysis allowed the suprascapular artery to be recognized in all visualized notches. The suprascapular vein was visible in 176 notches and the suprascapular nerve in 150. Notches containing both suprascapular nerve and vein were significantly wider and shallower than average. As the suprascapular artery is the most easily recognised structure in the area, it may serve as a useful landmark of the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch...</b>|$|E
40|$|The most {{important}} risk factor of suprascapular nerve entrapment {{is probably the}} shape of the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> (SSN).

40|$|BACKGROUND:Although cadaveric {{studies have}} {{revealed}} <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> shape variations, few {{have investigated the}} association between <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> variation and age or gender. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> shape variations by use of three-dimensional computed tomography (3 DCT) and to determine if there was any association with age or gender. METHODS:Three-dimensional CT images of 762 shoulders of 762 patients were analyzed in this study. Participants comprised 404 men and 358 women, with an average age of 58. 2 ± 19. 1 years. <b>Suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> shape variations were classified into six types on the basis of Rengachary's classification. RESULTS:Of the total study population, 11. 4 % were classified as type I, 23. 5 % as type II, 30. 1 % as type III, 14. 8 % as type IV, 15. 9 % as type V, and 4. 3 % as type VI. Average age was 56. 5 ± 20. 5 years for type I, 57. 0 ± 19. 5 years for type II, 55. 5 ± 20. 0 years for type III, 56. 4 ± 18. 5 years for type IV, 65. 5 ± 14. 4 years for type V, and 68. 0 ± 13. 4 years for type VI. Statistically significant age differences were found between types I-IV and V, between types I-IV and VI, and between the non-ossification group (types I-IV) and the ossification group (types V and VI). Male-to-female ratio among each type, and between the non-ossification group and the ossification group, were not statistically significantly different. CONCLUSIONS:Our results suggest that transverse scapular ligament ossification is associated with aging whereas individual variation explains differences among types I, II, III, and IV. Three-dimensional CT provides useful information for arthroscopic resection of the transverse scapular ligament, when the wide variety of <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> shape variations is considered.

40|$|Background: Recently, the {{existence}} of sensory branches of the suprascapular nerve (SSN) has been reported, and sensory disturbance at the lateral and posterior aspect of the shoulder {{has been focused on}} as a symptom of SSN palsy. We have performed arthroscopic release of SSN at the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> in patients with the sensory disturbance since 2006. The purposes of this study were to introduce the arthroscopic surgical technique and to investigate postoperative recovery of sensory disturbance. Methods: Twenty-five shoulders (11 men and 14 women, average age: 63. 9 years (range, 41 - 77)) followed for more than 1 year were included in this study. Arthroscopic decompression of SSN was performed using a suprascapular nerve portal (SN portal) as a landmark for approaching the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch.</b> Sensory disturbance of the shoulder was evaluated pre- and postoperatively. The follow-up period was 12 - 30 months (avg. 18. 5). Results: The arthroscopic procedures was able to be performed safely. The preoperative sensory disturbance fully recovered postoperatively in all shoulders. Conclusion: Arthroscopic release of SSN {{is considered to be a}} useful procedure for the entrapment of SSN at the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch.</b> The sensory disturbance at the lateral and posterior aspect of the shoulder can be used as one of the criteria of diagnosing SSN palsy especially in shoulders with massive rotator cuff tear, which usually have difficulty in diagnosing and assessing the treatment results of associated SSN palsy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{morphology}} of the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> (SSN) {{has been}} associated with suprascapular entrapment neuropathy, and injury to the suprascapular nerve in arthroscopic shoulder procedures. This study aimed to describe the morphology and morphometry of the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> in dry scapulae. The present study was done in 314 dry scapulae obtained from B. J. Medical College, Ahmedabad. In the present study the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> is classified on the basis of two classifications. According to one classification, SSN was classified into five types, type I without a discrete notch; type II a notch that was longest in transverse diameter; type III a notch that was longest in vertical diameter; type IV a bony foramen; type V a notch and a bony foramen. Based on gross appearance, SSN was classified as ‘U’ shaped, ‘V’ shaped, ‘J’ shaped, absent notch and indentation instead of a notch. The complete and partial ossification of the superior transverse scapular ligament was also noted. According to first classification following observations were made in the present study: type I- 29 %; type II- 52 %; type III- 16 %; type IV- 2 %; type V- 1 %. According to another classification, following observations were made: ‘U’ shaped notch 38 %, ‘V’ shaped notch 7 %, ‘J’ shaped notch 22 %, absent notch 18 %, and indentation instead of a notch 12 %. The complete ossification was seen in 3 % and partial ossification of the superior transverse scapular ligament in 2 % of cases.

40|$|Introduction. When {{using the}} double {{interval}} slide technique for arthroscopic repair of chronic large or massive rotator cuff tears, the posterior interval release {{is directed toward}} the scapular spine until the fat pad that protects the suprascapular nerve is reached. Injury to the suprascapular nerve can occur due to the nerve’s proximity to the operative field. This study aimed to identify safe margins for avoiding injury to the suprascapular nerve.

40|$|Background: The {{variable}} morphology of the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> {{is considered}} {{to be one of the}} predisposing factors in the etiology of suprascapular nerve entrapment syndrome. The morphology of the notch has been classified by various authors based on shape, ossification of superior transverse supra scapular ligament and measurements of the notch. Based on these classifications the "U " type is present more commonly and "V " type is more prone for entrapments. Owing to variations in the morphology of the notch in different populations, this paper attempts to study and classify the variable morphology of the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> in Tamil Nadu population of India. Materials & Methods: 240 dry human scapulae without any obvious pathology from the bone banks of VMKV Medical College and Vinayaka Mission's Homeopathy Medical College, Tamil Nadu were studied.

The entrapment of the suprascapular nerve by the ossified STSL may result in symptoms like pain in the shoulder region and also result in wasting and weakness of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. Such a condition has to be differentiated from other conditions like rotator cuff tears. Often asymptomatic cases make the diagnosis difficult. The present study reports the anomalous ossified STSL detected in a bone specimen, discusses its anatomical and radiological aspects and describes its clinical implications...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The suprascapular nerve (SSN) {{block is}} {{frequently}} performed for different shoulder pain conditions and for perioperative and postoperative pain control after shoulder surgery. Blind and image-guided techniques have been described, {{all of which}} target the nerve within the supraspinous fossa or at the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch.</b> This classic target point is not always ideal when ultrasound (US) is used because it is located deep under the muscles, and hence the nerve is not always visible. Blocking the nerve in the supraclavicular region, where it passes underneath the omohyoid muscle, could be an attractive alternative. METHODS: In the first step, 60 volunteers were scanned with US, both in the supraclavicular and the classic target area. The visibility of the SSN in both regions was compared. In the second step, 20 needles were placed into or immediately next to the SSN in the supraclavicular region of 10 cadavers. The accuracy of needle placement was determined by injection of dye and following dissection. RESULTS: In the supraclavicular region of volunteers, the nerve was identified in 81 % of examinations (95 % confidence interval [CI], 74 %- 88 %) and located at a median depth of 8 mm (interquartile range, 6 - 9 mm). Near the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> (supraspinous fossa), the nerve was unambiguously identified in 36 % of examinations (95 % CI, 28 %- 44 %) (P < 0. 001) and located at a median depth of 35 mm (interquartile range, 31 - 38 mm; P < 0. 001). In the cadaver investigation, the rate of correct needle placement of the supraclavicular approach was 95 % (95 % CI, 86 %- 100 %). CONCLUSIONS: Visualization of the SSN with US is better in the supraclavicular region {{as compared with the}} supraspinous fossa. The anatomic dissections confirmed that our novel supraclavicular SSN block technique is accurate...|$|E
40|$|The suprascapular {{ligament}} converts the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> into a foramen {{separating the}} vessels and nerve {{of the same}} name. It connects 2 regions of the same bone and does not cross any joint, and no mechanical function has yet been attributed to it. Nevertheless, variations in its thickness and length, and its tendency to ossify, suggest that the ligament responds to changes in mechanical load. This should {{be reflected in the}} composition of the extracellular matrix. The primary {{purpose of the present study}} is to demonstrate that the suprascapular ligament has fibrocartilaginous entheses (i. e. insertion sites), even though there is no obvious change in insertional angle that directly results from joint movement. Such a change is more typical of tendons or ligaments that cross highly mobile joints. The complete ligament (including both entheses) was removed from 7 cadavers shortly after death and fixed in 90 % methanol. Cryosections were immunolabelled with a panel of monoclonal antibodies against collagens (types I, II, III, VI), glycosaminoglycans (chondroitin 4 sulphate, chondroitin 6 sulphate, dermatan sulphate and keratan sulphates), proteoglycans (aggrecan and versican) and link protein. Both entheses were strongly fibrocartilaginous, and a moderately fibrocartilaginous matrix was also detected throughout the remainder of the ligament. The extracellular matrix of both entheses labelled strongly for type II collagen, aggrecan and link protein. The fibrocartilaginous character of the entheses suggests that the insertion sites of the ligament are subject to both compressive and tensile loading and are regions of stress concentration. This in turn probably reflects the complex shape of the scapula and the presence of a conspicuous indentation (the <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch)</b> near the ligament. The loading patterns may reflect either the attachment of muscles and/or the forces transmitted to the suprascapular ligament from the neighbouring coracoclavicular ligament...|$|E

Introduction. The superior transverse scapular ligament (STSL) links {{the margins of the}} <b>suprascapular</b> <b>notch</b> and converts it into a foramen, through which, the suprascapular nerve and, on some rare occasions, the suprascapular vessels pass. This conversion often results from partial or complete ossification of the STSL andmay produce compressive symptoms in the suprascapular nerve. Material and Method. Twenty shoulders from human fetuses were dissected without the aid of optical instruments and, using a digital pachymeter of precision 0. 01 millimeters, length measurements and thickness measurements were made. The fetal age wa...|$|E
