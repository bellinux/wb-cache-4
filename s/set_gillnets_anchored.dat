40|$|In July 1990, an {{observer}} program {{was established to}} collect data on the bycatch of the drift and <b>set</b> <b>gillnet</b> fisheries operating off the coast of California. These data are used for estimating mortality and for further studies of the biology of the species impacted. To date. 16 species of Cetacea have been identified in the observed incidental kill of the gillnet fisheries. In the drift gillnet fishery, observers reported 348 cetaceans incidentally killed, and biological samples were collected from 83. 6 % of these animals. The common dolphin, Delphinus delphis, was the most frequently observed species entangled in the drift gillnet fishing gear and comprised 48. 6 % of the observed incidental kill. In the <b>set</b> <b>gillnet</b> fishery, 20 cetaceans were observed killed, and biological samples were collected from five of these animals. The harbour porpoise, Phocoenaphocoena. was the most frequently observed species entangled in <b>set</b> <b>gillnet</b> gear and comprised 80 % of the observed incidental kill.

40|$|The European Commission has {{acknowledged}} {{the value of}} fleet-based management approaches since the 2001 Green Paper on the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). In the 2009 Green Paper, this was again recognized as a key area of interest for future development of the CFP, in particular setting the technical basis for the recent Data Collection Framework (DCF), which specifies the standard for national fishery sampling programs within a pan-European context. These policy changes require deeper and up to date knowledge about European fleets and fisheries, thus encouraging Member States to undertake scientific projects {{in order to obtain}} appropriate fleet segmentations classifying their fishing activities within a hierarchical structure. The work presented in this book is the first comprehensive analysis of the Spanish fleets operating in Atlantic European waters, taking into account both European and national management requirements. This has been possible due to the availability of official logbooks, which provide the broadest perspective on the activity of Spanish fleets in the study area. The only exception to this is small scale fisheries, pursued mainly by vessels of less than 10 m of length and, therefore, not subject to the requirement of keeping logbooks. In order to match better European and Spanish fleet classifications, a new level (“Management Unit”) is proposed here, which is placed between “modalidad”, used in the Spanish regulations, and “métier”, as is defined by the recent DCF. Spanish national waters comprise four fishing grounds, two of which are in the European Atlantic. Nine Management Units have been identified in the Northern Spanish fishing ground: bottom otter trawl (OTB 10), bottom pair trawl (PTB 10), purse seine (PSN 10), set long line (LLS 10), <b>set</b> <b>gillnet</b> targeting hake (GNS 11), <b>set</b> <b>gillnet</b> targeting anglerfish (GNS 12), trolling (LTL 11) and bait-boats (LHP 11) targeting albacore, and hand line targeting mackerel (LHP 12). Two Management Units have been identified in Southern Spanish waters: bottom otter trawl (OTB 20) and purse seine (PSN 20). In European waters outside Spain, six Management Units have been identified in non-Iberian waters: bottom otter trawl (OTB 50), bottom pair trawl (PTB 50), set long line (LLS 50) and <b>set</b> <b>gillnet</b> (GNS 50) by vessels of more than 100 GRT, and set long line (LLS 60) and <b>set</b> <b>gillnet</b> (GNS 60) by vessels of less than 100 GRT. Finally, one Management Unit using bottom otter trawl has been found to operate in Portuguese waters (OTB 70). Unluckily, the analyses made on the logbooks of the Spanish fleet using drifting long line could not be used to categorize this fleet due to the geographical limitations of the logbooks available. After detailed analyses and categorization of the Management Units, the results obtained were used in an exercise to test the usefulness and feasibility of using logbook information to answer some DCF requirements. This revealed that logbooks are an essential tool to deal with bioeconomic challenges posed by the new CFP. Versión del edito...|$|R

40|$|Galicia (NW Spain) is an {{important}} fishing region with a high potential for cetacean–fishery interactions. Cetacean depredation on catch and damage to fishing gear can potentially lead to substantial economic loss for fishers, while cetacean bycatch raises conservation concerns. With the aim of gathering information on the types and scale of interactions and of suggesting possible management strategies, we conducted face-to-face interviews with fishers in local fishing harbours, in particular to identify specific problematic interactions and to quantify the level of economic loss and bycatch rates associated with these interactions. We found that cetacean–fishery interactions are frequent, although damage to catch and fishing gear by cetaceans was mostly reported as small. Nevertheless, substantial economic loss can result from common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) damaging coastal gillnets and from short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) scattering fish in purse-seine fisheries. Cetacean bycatch mortality {{was reported to be}} highest for trawls and <b>set</b> <b>gillnets,</b> and probably exceeds sustainable levels for local common and bottlenose dolphin populations. Although interview data may be biased due to the perceptions of interviewees, and therefore should be interpreted with care, the methodology allowed us to cover multiple sites and fisheries within a reasonable time frame. Minimizing cetacean–fishery interactions requires the implementation of case-specific management strategies with the active participation of fishers. For <b>set</b> <b>gillnet</b> and purse-seine fisheries, the use of acoustic deterrent devices (pingers) may prevent cetaceans from approaching and getting trapped in the nets. For trawl fisheries, where bycatch appears to be particularly high at night in water depths of 100 – 300 m, possible solutions include the implementation of time/area closures and the relocation of some fishing effort to deeper waters.

Overall, very high species richness (Chao 2 mean= 250, SD= 16. 15) and diversity index (Simpson Inverse Mean= 43. 72, SD= 0. 02) estimates suggesting that the Sangha River mainstream could host {{one of the highest}} freshwater fish diversity across the region. Overall, Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) suggested a high total variance in species data, of which significant proportions explained by environmental variables. Latitude and distance to park borders had the strongest importance in ordination, and fishes tended to avoid high human-disturbed areas near large towns and high water turbidity. A special focus was further put into 7 fish species, recognized for their economic value in local fisheries. Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE) and contribution in local fisheries were computed for the 7 species for main fishing techniques. Overall, significantly highest average CPUE was found in wet season months, and <b>set</b> <b>Gillnets</b> appeared the most efficient but were mainly targeting small-size and immature fishes and therefore not a sustainable fishing technique. Extrapolations from otolith readings suggested that an overwhelming majority of harvested fishes were estimated to be only a few months old, under their age-at first maturity.

Most ports along the Peruvian coast were sampled during short visits while Cerro Azul, Pucusana, Chimbote, Ancón and San Andrés were more intensively monitored. The ban {{was found not}} to be enforced or at best only partially so. Fishermen often avoided overtly landing entire carcasses, which impeded quantification of kills. Large numbers of small cetaceanswere caught directly and indirectly in drift and <b>set</b> <b>gillnets,</b> were harpooned or were netted in purse seines (and often landed alive) by vessels operated by the fishmeal industry. Principal species affected included Lagenorhynchus obscurus, Delphinus capensis, Phocoena spinipinnis and Tursiops truncatus, although occasional takes of at least six other small cetacean species occurred. Estimated annual kills (±SE) were: 1, 651 ± 53 (1990) at Pucusana; 2, 1181 ± 389 (1992) and 1, 927 ± 237 (1992 / 93) at Cerro Azul; 2, 100 (1991) and 1, 383 ± 274 (1992) at Ancón; 1, 825 ± 220 at Chimbote (1993) and about 470 at San Andrés (1992).

40|$|During the 1980 s, {{extensive}} bycatch of seabirds {{and marine}} mammals in central California’s <b>set</b> <b>gillnet</b> fisheries prompted {{a series of}} area and depth closures, which ultimately appeared successful at reducing mortality of the species of primary concern, Common Murre (Uria aalge), sea otter (Enhydra lutris), and harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). The effects of the restrictions, however, were confounded with changes in the distribu-tion and intensity of fishing effort during the early 1990 s. This study documents 1990 - 1998 patterns of fishing effort in the central California halibut (Paralichthys californicus) gillnet fishery and presents information on bycatch of the above three species. A National Marine Fisheries Service observer program obtained bycatch data from 1990 to 1994, but was dis-continued after 1994. Since then, gillnet effort has increased and shifted into the southern areas of Monterey Bay, where bycatch was high during the 1980 s. The recent increase in gillnet effort coincides with higher beach deposition rates for all three species. In this study, historical entanglement rate data are combined with estimates of fishing effort for 1995 - 1998 to produce several sets of mortality estimates based {{on a variety of}} assump- 142 Forney et al. — Bycatch in Central California Gillnets tions. Without further data, {{it is not possible to}} validate most of the as-sumptions. The range of total mortality estimates for the 4 -year period 1995 - 1998 is 5, 918 - 13, 060 Common Murres (S.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of distribution and aggregation in herring (Clupea harengus) {{can be enhanced}} by integrated multi-scale studies in small ecosystems. Hydro-acoustics, underwater cameras, herring and predator gillnet samples and oceanographical measurements were used to quantify herring schooling dynamics. During autumn (September) after an active feeding period, the herring was distributed in small and dense schools, mostly close to land and in relatively shallow water ( 40 m depth). All recorded herring schools were then vertically extended {{in the water column}} within the most variable temperature and oxygen profiles, presumably enabling individuals to adjust maturation rate to prevailing environmental conditions and synchronize spawning of individuals within the school. From late February prior to spawning, only one major pelagic school was observed, extraordinarily stationary at the only inlet to the inner basin. The pre-spawning herring aggregation was fairly easy to detect acoustically for more than one month. Just prior to spawning and during spawning, herring spread out and became extremely difficult to detect acoustically. Only underwater cameras and bottom <b>set</b> <b>gillnets</b> could then be used to identify herring and selected spawning areas. We argue that the dramatic seasonal changes in acoustic detectability and catchability we observe is best understood and predicted based on detailed knowledge of how herring react to a changing environment according to their physiological state and motivation. Such factors should also be taken more systematically into account when performing acoustic surveys in large marine ecosystems. We need to study in more detail the vital underlying processes behind the substantial variability observed in acoustic detectability and catchability of pelagic planktivorous fish species during their annual life cycle in order to better understand and quantify variability in acoustic surveys, and thereby improve our acoustic abundance estimation...|$|R
40|$|The bycatch of {{cetaceans}} {{in fishing}} gear {{is considered to}} be one of the biggest conservation threats to these species. Gear modifications have the potential to reduce these bycatches in global fisheries but there is little available information on how such modifications may change the fishing performance of gear, or indeed the behavior of cetaceans interacting with fishing gear. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were used to identify factors related to cetacean bycatches in UK bottom <b>set</b> <b>gillnets.</b> Rigged net height had a significant positive relationship with harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) bycatch in ICES Area VII suggesting that lowering the profile of gillnets may have the potential to reduce bycatch rates. Modifications to gillnets, such as changing the amount of floatation or increasing the density of the meshes, were found to have significant effects on the active fishing heights of these nets. However, results from a bycatch mitigation trial in Argentina showed that the reduced fishing profile of one experimental net did not result in a concurrent reduction in the bycatch rate of Franciscana dolphins (Pontoporia blainvillei). While there was no significant difference in the rate, length or intensity of harbour porpoise encounters in the presence or absence of gillnets, the proportion of fast echolocation click trains were significantly higher when a net was present, indicating that porpoises either increased acoustic inspection of the net or foraging in the vicinity of the net. An analysis of underwater video footage collected inside trawl nets in an Australia fishery showed that bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) were present inside nets more frequently than they were caught and were actively foraging inside these nets. The orientation of dolphins inside these nets indicates that the current design of excluder devices used in this fishery could be improved to further reduce bycatch rates.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} at twelve fish landing sites in Java and Kalimantan Islands, west central Indonesia, from June 2005 to October 2006 {{to overcome the}} lack of knowledge on chondrichthyan species in Indonesia. Data were collected for seven consecutive days at each site from fish landings, including species diversity, fisheries, utilizations, and biological data of chondrichthyan species. A total of 23, 454 individuals of chondrichthyans, 104 species and 28 families were recorded from 12 landing sites during the study, with an estimated total biomass of more than 70, 000 kg. This total consisted of 65 species of shark representing 16 families and 58 species of rays representing 11 families and a single species of holocephalan. Dasyatidae and Carcharhinidae were the most common families recorded. Dasyatis kuhlii (Dasyatidae) was the most abundant chondrichthyan species in this study, while Himantura gerrardi contributed most to the total biomass. Ordination of abundance values showed a segregation between the sites that had fishing grounds in shallow waters (the Java Sea, Karimata Strait) and sites that fished the deeper waters (the Indian Ocean, Makassar {{and a part of}} Sunda Strait). The shallower areas were typified by some common dasyatids and inshore sharks, and the deeper areas by large, oceanic and deep water chondrichthyans. The present study also identified which types of fishing gear contributed most to the total biomass and size of elasmobranch landings. A total of fifteen types of fishing gear are used from fishing vessels operating in the Java Sea and adjacent area (including Karimata Strait, Sunda Strait, Makassar Strait) and off south Java (the Indian Ocean) to catch chondrichthyan fishes, either as bycatch or as target of fishing. <b>Set</b> <b>gillnet</b> was the most common gear that caught chondrichthyan fishes, but Danish seine nets contributed most to both the total number and total biomass of chondrichthyan fishes captured in the observed area during the study. The Danish seine net (cantrang) was the least selective gear that caught elasmobranchs in Java and Kalimantan during the study, following by bottom lampara nets and <b>set</b> <b>gillnets</b> that were operated in inshore waters. Danish seine nets were also considered to contribute most to overall fishing pressure in the Java Sea. H. gerrardi contributed most to the total biomass of batoids captured in the Danish seine fishery from Batang landing site which is the largest contributor to the total catch of elasmobranchs in west central Indonesia. H. gerrardi is categorized as the “first class” {{and one of the most}} sought after rays in the skin industry at Batang due to the quality of its skin. Most elasmobranch products are utilized and marketed locally and some others are sold to large cities or other countries due to their high values, such as fins, gill rakers, skins and cartilage. The present study of chondrichthyan diversity in west central Indonesia also provides detailed data on the size composition and reproductive biology of some common elasmobranchs in the region. Size composition of each species varies among regions and fishing areas. Species that were caught in large numbers from heavily fished areas matured earlier than those from the lower fishing pressure areas. Precocious maturity of some dominant species may also indicate the high level of fishing pressure in the area where they are occurred. Diets of some common dasyatids caught from the Danish seine fishery operating in the Java Sea were also investigated to find out the contribution of stomach fullness to the size and weight relationships variation. More than 90 % of the diet of H. gerrardi was crustaceans, represented by carid shrimps, mantis shrimps and penaeids. Conversely, teleosts made significant contributions to the diet of H. jenkinsii and large size classes of H. uarnak and H. undulata...|$|R
40|$|Situated in West Africa, Senegal has 700 km of {{coastline}} {{characterized by}} a large Eastern Boundary Upwelling Ecosystem providing significant biological productivity. Small-scale fishing {{plays an important role}} in the national economy of Senegal. The fishing gear used has a potentially direct or indirect impact on seabirds. To examine and evaluate this impact surveys were conducted on eight landing sites. Field surveys (2 - 3 days) took place in 2015 based on a standardized interview with questionnaire conducted with 225 small-scale fishermen. The results obtained indicate that longlines are the fishing gear that causes the highest rate of annual accidental seabird catch (63 % of seabird caugth (n = 702)), followed by handlines (16 %) and <b>anchored</b> <b>gillnet</b> (6 %). The Pomarine Skua (Stercorarius pomarinus) is the most captured bird annually (29 % of total captured birds), closely followed by the Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) (28 % of captured birds) and the Northern Gannet (Morus bassanus) (13 % of captured birds). The village of Yoff is the landing site which has the highest rate of annual seabird catch with 39 % of the total catch indicated, followed by Kayar with 19 % and Saint Louis with 14 %, both situated on the Grande Côte. Further studies should be conducted in the entire Senegalese-Mauritanian coast in particular in the northern part of Senegal, to better evaluate the annual catch of seabirds. A great collaboration should also be established with longliners, handliners and <b>anchored</b> <b>gillnet</b> fishers to better quantify incidental catch of seabirds by the artisanal fishing gear and set up mitigation actions...|$|R
40|$|Lake Maracaibo {{for many}} years, with annual {{landings}} reaching 18 000 metric tons in the 1960 s and 1970 s (Ferrer Montaño 1995).

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the biology, ecology and anthropogenic threats of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) off Zanzibar, Tanzania, {{based on research}} conducted and samples collected between 2000 and 2008. Distribution and occurrence are described based on incidental catches (bycatch) in gillnet fisheries. Biology and ecology are examined by ageing and studying the reproductive biology and stomach contents of collected specimens. The composition of organohalogen compounds is determined in blubber samples, and assessment and mitigation of bycatch are conducted using observers onboard fishing vessels. Fisheries bycatch data showed that Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins occur year round in all areas around Zanzibar. Sexual maturity was attained between 7 and 8 years and body length 190 - 200 cm in females and at 16 years and body length 213 cm in males. The gestation period {{was estimated to be}} 12. 3 months, with calving occurring throughout the year, peaking November-March and with an interval of 2. 7 years. The estimated pregnancy rate was between 0. 10 and 0. 58 depending on methods used. Stomach contents revealed a relatively large number of prey species, but that only a few small- and medium-sized neritic fish and cephalopods contribute substantially to the diet. Estimates of total annual bycatch were > 9 % which is not considered sustainable. An experiment showed that pingers can be a short term mitigation measure to reduce bycatch of dolphins in both drift- and bottom <b>set</b> <b>gillnets.</b> Methoxylated polybrominated diphenyl ethers (Meo-BDEs) were found at higher concentrations than anthropogenic organic pesticides (OCPs), with only traces of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) detected. This study reveals the magnitude and apparent susceptibility of Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins off Zanzibar to anthropogenic threats, especially fisheries bycatch, and it is clear that immediate conservation and management measures are needed to reduce bycatch.
