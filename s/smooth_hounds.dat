50|$|The common smooth-hound has a grey-brown {{back and}} is white on its underneath. It is often {{confused}} with the starry smooth-hound which has white spots on its back. The starry smooth-hound can often have faded spots which leads to misidentification. Another shark it is often confused with is the tope shark although the common <b>smooth</b> <b>hound</b> has a larger second dorsal fin. Due to {{the similarities between the}} common smooth-hound and other sharks, misidentification occurred for a long time.|$|R
50|$|GuernseySt Peter Port Breakwater - (Location of 8 Bailiwick Records (Angler Fish, Couchs Sea Bream, Lesser Spotted Dogfish, Flounder, <b>Smooth</b> <b>Hound,</b> Tadpole Fish, Whiting and Ballan Wrasse)). As {{the records}} show, the St Peter Port {{breakwater}} is good fishing for many species. Located just passed Castle Cornet {{in the town}} of St Peter Port. The breakwater is a light house {{on the end of a}} pier. It offers easy access and safe fishing although it can be a very busy site due to this facts.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} species that instigate predation on C.lavauxi. Because they inhabit the area where the tide does not often reach, their predators are not generally fish but birds. Their main predators are generalist birds such as Seagulls or Kingfisher. The major form of predation from fish includes the <b>Smooth</b> <b>Hound</b> Fish, Spined Dogfish, Terakihi, Sea Perch, Moki and Red Gurnard. One defense mechanism the crab has is being able to live on the beaches where fish are unable to eat them. They are also at times able to evade the predators by using their quick reactions and speed.|$|R

50|$|The {{gummy shark}} (Mustelus antarcticus) {{also known as}} the Australian <b>smooth</b> <b>hound,</b> flake, and <b>smooth</b> dog-shark, is a shark in the family Triakidae. It is a slender, grey shark with white spots along the body and flat, plate-like teeth for {{crushing}} its prey. It has a maximum length between 157 cm (male) and 175 cm (female). It feeds on crustaceans, marine worms, small fish, and cephalopods. Gummy sharks are found in the waters around southern Australia, from Shark Bay in Western Australia to Port Stephens in New South Wales, from the surface down to a depth of 350 m. The reproduction of gummy sharks is ovoviviparous.|$|R

50|$|In Britain, surfcasting {{is often}} called beachcasting. It is a popular form of fishing which is carried out all around {{the coast of the}} British Isles. Beachcasters use very long fishing rods, usually between 12 and 16 feet. The beachcaster will stand on a beach or {{shoreline}} and cast out to sea with either a water filled float, or a lead weight weighing between 120g and 200g. Bait used in this form of fishing might include limpets, mussels, lugworm, ragworm, sandeel, mackerel strip, squid, peeler crab or razor fish. Additionally, artificial flies or even spinners may be used for species such as mackerel or bass. It is a common pastime in coastal areas of Scotland, England, Wales and Ireland and often results in the capture of large specimens of many species of fish, including: flatfish, bass, cod, whiting, pollack, black bream, dogfish, <b>smooth</b> <b>hound,</b> bull huss, rays and tope.|$|R
40|$|Chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate GAGs were {{extracted}} and purified {{from the}} skins of grey triggerfish (GTSG) and <b>smooth</b> <b>hound</b> (SHSG). The disaccharide composition produced by chondroitinase ABC treatment showed {{the presence of}} nonsulfated disaccharide, monosulfated disaccharides ΔDi 6 S and ΔDi 4 S, and disulfated disaccharides in different percentages. In particular, the nonsulfated disaccharide ΔDi 0 S of GTSG and SHSG were 3. 5 % and 5. 5 %, respectively, while monosulfated disaccharides ΔDi 6 S and ΔDi 4 S were evaluated to be 18. 2 %, 59 % and 14. 6 %, 47. 0 %, respectively. Capillary elecrophoresis analysis of GTSG and SHSG contained 99. 2 % and 95. 4 % of chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate, respectively. PAGE analysis showed a GTSG and SHSG having molecular masses with average values of 41. 72 KDa and 23. 8 KDa, respectively. HCT 116 cell proliferation was inhibited (p< 0. 05) by 70. 6 % and 72. 65 % at 200 μg/mL of GTSG and SHSG respectively. Both GTSG and SHSG demonstrated promising antiproliferative potential, which {{may be used as}} a novel, effective agent...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} trace their feeding habits, stable carbon and {{nitrogen}} isotope ratios (d 15 N and d 13 C), {{as well as}} trace metal concentrations (Zn, Cd, Fe, Cu, Se and Hg) were analysed in the tissues of five commercial shark species from the Celtic Sea: the tope shark Galeorhinus galeus, the black-mouthed catshark Galeus melastomus, the starry <b>smooth</b> <b>hound</b> Mustelus asterias, the spiny dogfish Squalus acanthias and the lesser-spotted dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula. Our results were compared to previously described stomach contents and isotopic composition of potential preys. Isotopic ratio d 15 N suggested that tope sharks fed at a higher trophic level (16. 7 ‰ in the muscle) than the other species, reflecting its piscivorous diet. The lower values of spiny dogfish (11. 6 ‰ in the muscle) might be explained, amongst other things, by either its migratory behaviour or its preference for preys from lower trophic levels. Cd and Hg were correlated with isotopic ratios d 13 C and d 15 N, and were shown to be diet-related whereas Zn, Fe and Cu seemed much more linked to species-specific metabolism. Although this multidisciplinary approach is revealed as {{a useful tool for}} the study of shark ecology, the lack of known trophic fractionation suggests that isotopic data be compared to traditional diet analyses...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{ultrasound}} (US) pre-treatment {{on the evolution}} of Maillard reaction (MR), induced between low molecular weight (LMW) peptides and sucrose, was studied. LMW peptides (< 1 kDa) were obtained by the ultrafiltration of <b>smooth</b> <b>hound</b> viscera protein hydrolysates, produced by Neutrase, Esperase and Purafect. MR was induced by heating the LMW peptides in the presence of sucrose for 2 h at 90 °C, without or with US pre-treatment. During the reaction, a marked decrease in pH values, coupled to the increase in colour of the Maillard reaction products (MRPs), were recorded. In addition, after sonication, the glycation degree was significantly enhanced in Esperase-derived peptides/sucrose conjugates (p < 0. 05). Moreover, results showed that thermal heating, particularly after US treatment, reduced the bitter taste and enhanced the antioxidant capacities of the resulting conjugates. Hence, it could be concluded that US leads to efficient mixing of sugar-protein solution and efficient heat/mass transfer, contributing to increase the MR rate.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the antioxidant, anti-ACE and antibacterial activities of <b>smooth</b> <b>hound</b> viscera hydrolysates (SHVHs). Viscera, as by-product, were hydrolyzed with crude alkaline protease extract from the same species, three commercial proteases and a combination endogenous and exogenous preparations. Hydrolysates showed different degrees of hydrolysis and the digestion with endogenous enzymes in combination with commercial proteases was found to enhance protein hydrolysis. The resulting SHVHs had high protein content (70. 89 %– 89. 06 %) and they were mainly constituted by Gly, Glu and Gln, while Tau was the major free amino acid. In addition, they contained high amounts of UMP, Uridine, GMP and Guanosine, while undigested proteins were mainly rich in IMP and Xanthine. Furthermore, SHVHs showed different molecular mass distribution and RP-HPLC profiles proving their molecular mass and hydrophilic/hydrophobic peptide heterogeneity. All the SHVHs exhibited antioxidant activity, in terms of radical-scavenging activity, reducing power, metal chelating activity, β-carotene protection, lipid peroxidation inhibition and DNA breakage assay, and it was found that a medium degree of hydrolysis was appropriate to obtain hydrolysates with good antioxidant capacity. In addition, the SHVHs antioxidant activity was improved after simulated gastrointestinal digestion. Besides their antibacterial effect against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, all the hydrolysates showed varying degrees of ACE inhibitory activities and the highest one was achieved by the Purafect hydrolysate (IC 50 = 75 μg/mL). The overall data suggested that the SHVHs could be used as potential source of natural antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-ACE peptides to formulate functional foods.

5000|$|It {{is thought}} that Sloughis {{originally}} came from what is today Ethiopia (ancient tributes to the pharaohs included smooth Lop-eared Sighthounds from Nubia, south of Egypt). On old fragments of earthenware (about 3000 B.C.), a short-haired sighthound with lop ears was discovered that resembles a Sloughi. In 2008, a DNA study indicated that the Sloughi is a genetically unique population of sighthounds and the genetic sequences it shares with the Basenji, Sica, and Nguni indicate that this breed is, on the maternal side, embedded in Africa, possibly for thousands of years. Therefore, it should {{not to be confused}} with the smooth Saluki of the Arabian peninsula and the Middle East, nor to be confused with the <b>smooth</b> Afghan <b>Hound.</b> The Sloughi was and still is used for hunting in its native countries, and also is a reliable guard dog. Today, the Sloughi is found mainly in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. Morocco is responsible for the breed's FCI Standard.|$|R
40|$|Trace element {{concentrations}} (Hg, Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn) {{were determined}} in the muscle, gonads, skin, and brain of <b>smooth</b> <b>hound</b> Mustelus mustelus {{in order to}} define the metal distribution patterns. The data indicated that metal accumulation depended on the tissues probably {{as a consequence of}} metabolic needs, physiochemical properties, and detoxification processes specific for each element. Metal concentrations were higher in gonads (Hg 0. 10 – 0. 70 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Cd 0. 02 – 0. 10 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Pb 0. 08 – 0. 39 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Cr 0. 06 – 0. 36 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Ni 1. 37 – 3. 00 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Zn 9. 15 – 16. 30 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Cu 1. 95 – 21. 62 μg g[*]−[*] 1) and skin (Hg 0. 16 – 0. 66 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Cd 0. 01 – 0. 04 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Pb 0. 10 – 0. 62 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Cr 0. 15 – 0. 68 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Ni 1. 60 – 7. 20 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Zn 9. 00 – 16. 00 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Cu 0. 78 – 6. 80 μg g[*]−[*] 1) than brain (Hg 0. 04 – 0. 34 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Cd 0. 01 – 0. 05 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Pb 0. 03 – 0. 59 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Cr 0. 08 – 0. 48 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Ni 5. 59 – 9. 69 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Zn 5. 90 – 7. 35 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Cu 0. 90 – 4. 02 μg g[*]−[*] 1), while muscle always exhibited the lowest levels (Hg 1. 03 – 2. 58 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Cd 0. 01 – 0. 06 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Pb 0. 02 – 0. 16 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Cr 0. 05 – 0. 28 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Ni 1. 13 – 2. 48 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Zn 2. 64 – 5. 06 μg g[*]−[*] 1; Cu 0. 33 – 2. 23 μg g[*]−[*] 1). Ni and Hg took exception having the highest concentrations in brain and muscle, respectively. An assessment of the risk for human due to the consumption of these marine organisms was also undertaken. Regarding Cd and Pb intakes, consumption did not guide to any concerns, while it should be extremely moderate when considering Hg intake. The comparative analyses revealed that Mediterranean sharks were exposed to higher Hg levels than biota inhabiting open ocean...|$|R
