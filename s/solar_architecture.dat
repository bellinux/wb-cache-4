5|$|The common {{features}} of passive <b>solar</b> <b>architecture</b> are orientation {{relative to the}} Sun, compact proportion (a low surface area to volume ratio), selective shading (overhangs) and thermal mass. When these features are tailored to the local climate and environment they can produce well-lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range. Socrates' Megaron House {{is a classic example}} of passive solar design. The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together solar lighting, heating and ventilation systems in an integrated solar design package. Active solar equipment such as pumps, fans and switchable windows can complement passive design and improve system performance.|$|E

Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute solar energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air. Active solar technologies encompass solar thermal energy, using solar collectors for heating, and solar power, converting sunlight into electricity either directly using photovoltaics (PV), or indirectly using concentrated solar power (CSP).|$|E

2500|$|Solar energy, radiant {{light and}} {{heat from the}} sun, has been {{harnessed}} by humans since ancient times using a range of ever-evolving technologies. Solar energy technologies include solar heating, solar photovoltaics, concentrated solar power and <b>solar</b> <b>architecture,</b> which can make considerable contributions to solving {{some of the most}} urgent problems the world now faces. The International Energy Agency projected that solar power could provide [...] "a third of the global final energy demand after 2060, while CO2 emissions would be reduced to very low levels." [...] Solar technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute solar energy. Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems and solar thermal collectors to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air. From 2012 to 2016 solar capacity tripled and now provides 1.3% of global energy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As {{a kind of}} pollution-free and {{sustainable}} energy, solar energy has received people’s favor increasingly. Integration of <b>solar</b> power and <b>architecture</b> {{has become one of}} the important ways that people use solar energy. In this paper, numerical analysis of four frame-shear wall structure models on which PV panels are installed or not installed is conducted by ANSYS. The results show that integration of <b>solar</b> power and <b>architecture</b> meets the requirements of technical specification for concrete structures of tall building. But PV panels installed on the building surface will increase story displacement and produce stress and strain redistribution, which have negative effects on structural safety. This study provides a reference for the structure design of integration of <b>solar</b> power and <b>architecture...</b>|$|R

40|$|One {{key problem}} in {{optimizing}} organic solar cells is {{to maximize the}} absorption of incident light {{and to keep the}} charge carrier transport paths as short as possible in order to minimize transport losses. The large versatility of organic semiconductors and compositions requires specific optimization of each system. We investigate two model systems, the MDMO-PPV:PCBM blend and the P 3 HT:PCBM blend. Due to the small thickness of the functional layers in the order of several ten nanometers, coherent optics has to be considered and therefore interference effects play a dominant role. The influence of the thickness of the photoactive layer on the light absorption is investigated and compared with experimental data. The potential of an optical spacer which is introduced between the aluminium electrode and the photoactive layer to enhance the light harvesting is evaluated by optical modelling. Optical modelling becomes more complex for novel <b>solar</b> cell <b>architectures</b> based on na nostructured substrates.

50|$|Led by Germany’s <b>solar</b> <b>{{architecture}}</b> pioneer Rolf Disch, this architecture {{firm has}} built {{with the sun}} as its foundation since 1969. Rolf Disch <b>Solar</b> <b>Architecture</b> has implemented the most up-to-date technology to design sustainable buildings from churches and schools, to homes and commercial developments. With {{the creation of the}} PlusEnergy concept, their design has focused more and more specifically on positive energy balanced buildings, which generate more power than the consume through extremely efficient energy use and photovoltaic panel use. In 1994 they created the Heliotrope, the first building worldwide to create more energy than it uses. With the application of this PlusEnergy concept, Rolf Disch <b>Solar</b> <b>Architecture</b> further developed the concept into homes that use acute energy efficieny and have roofs made entirely of photovoltaic panels. 59 of these PlusEnergy homes were built as the Solar Settlement between 2002 and 2004, later to be followed by the Sun Ship. The Sun Ship, finished in 2006, is a retail, commercial/office and residential building with 60000 sq ft. that also produces more energy than it consumes. Also the first building of its kind worldwide, the Sun Ship was truly the most extensive example of sustainable and renewable energy building by Rolf Disch <b>Solar</b> <b>Architecture.</b>|$|E
50|$|Community {{planning}} {{goes hand in}} {{hand with}} sustainable development and thus Rolf Disch <b>Solar</b> <b>Architecture</b> dedicates much if their design and planning to the symbiosis of their projects surroundings. A solar community generates identification and an enormous public image. Disch says he attracts great tenants, innovative undertakings and creative work places through his design. Rolf Disch <b>Solar</b> <b>Architecture</b> always aims to create a community with combined uses for an ecological urban planning concept like traffic management - with wide, attractive walkways, bike routes and connections to public transportation. At the Solar Settlement for example, tenants and owners incorporate bike- and carsharing and the neighborhood has an extensive car-free zone with many public transportation connections. Rolf Disch <b>Solar</b> <b>Architecture</b> also has incorporated community solutions for energy. For example, a biomass cogeneration unit is extremely expedient, which meets the (reduced) additional heating demands for his Plusenergy homes.|$|E
