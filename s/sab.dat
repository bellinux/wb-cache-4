5|$|Cyclone Monica {{attained}} {{its peak}} intensity on 23 April near Cape Wessel with a barometric pressure 916mbar (hPa; 27.05inHg). Maximum winds were estimated at 250km/h (155mph 10-minute sustained) by the Bureau of Meteorology while the JTWC assessed {{it to have}} attained winds of 285km/h (180mph 1-minute sustained). Using the Dvorak technique, the peak intensity of the cyclone was estimated at T-number of 7.5 according to the Satellite Analysis Branch (<b>SAB),</b> yet the Advanced Dvorak Technique of the CIMSS automatically estimated at T8.0, the highest ranking on the Dvorak Scale. However, since the JTWC, <b>SAB</b> and CIMSS are not the official warning centres for Australian cyclones, these intensities remain unofficial.|$|E

40|$|The {{reported}} {{incidence of}} balanced chromosomal translocations in couples with multiple spontaneous abortions (<b>SABs)</b> ranges from 0 % of 31 %. Because our experience {{has suggested that}} <b>SABs</b> are useful for ascertaining balanced translocations, we report the results of chromosome analyses performed on blood specimens from 440 individuals including 200 couples who were ascertained {{on the basis of}} two or more <b>SABs.</b> Balanced translocations were found in 3. 6 % of these 200 couples. For 122 of these couples, more detailed reproductive histories were available. For 48 couples with two <b>SABs,</b> four (8. 4 %) had balanced translocations; for 37 couples with three <b>SABs,</b> one (2. 7 %) had a balanced translocation; for 20 couples with four <b>SABs,</b> two (10 %) had balanced translocations; and for 17 couples with five or more <b>SABs,</b> one (5. 9 %) had a balanced translocation. These 122 couples could also be classified on the basis of having abnormal or healthy children. For 40 couples with two or more <b>SABs,</b> one or more healthy children, and no abnormal offspring, two (5. 0 %) had balanced translocations; for 20 couples with two or more <b>SABs</b> and one or more abnormal children (and in some cases one or more healthy children), one (5. 0 %) had a balanced translocation; for 62 couples with two or more <b>SABs</b> and no other pregnancies, four (6. 5 %) had balanced translocations...|$|R

5|$|Although the eye feature became {{obscured}} and banding features {{appeared to}} be dissipating six hours after becoming a hurricane, the NHC predicted rapid intensification. As the eye became visible on satellite imagery early on August23, winds increased to 100mph (155km/h), and Fausto became a Category 2 hurricane. Although the convective cloud tops had warmed slightly late that day, wind speeds continued to increase, and intensity estimates made at the University of Wisconsin were as high as 145mph (230km/h), though the National Hurricane Center was in agreement with estimates from all three Dvorak Technique agencies (the Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch (TAFB), the Satellite Analysis Branch (<b>SAB),</b> and the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA)), which estimated winds at 115mph (185km/h). Based on this, Hurricane Fausto had intensified into a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale.|$|E
5|$|Conditions were {{favorable}} for the nascent depression to strengthen. The Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme model predicted {{the system would}} become a Category4 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale when the system was only a tropical depression. Only six hours after the NHC issued its first advisory the agency upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Marie, the thirteenth named storm of the 2014 season. The storm very quickly organized, developing a central dense overcast consisting of intense convection; this was aided by warm water temperatures and low wind shear. On August23, the NHC upgraded Marie to hurricane status, and an eye began forming later that day. On the next day, as the storm rapidly intensified, the eye became much more distinct and {{was surrounded by a}} powerful eyewall. During this phase the storm wobbled, shifting due west before resuming its previous motion. At 18:00UTC on August24, Marie attained Category5 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, the first such Pacific hurricane since Celia in 2010. The NHC estimated peak sustained winds of 160mph (260km/h), based on a Dvorak T-number of 7.0 provided by TAFB and <b>SAB.</b> They also estimated Marie's minimum barometric pressure at 918mbar (hPa; 27.11inHg), ranking as the seventh-strongest in the Pacific east of the International Date Line since records began in 1949. Coincidentally, Hurricane Odile attained the same pressure just three weeks later. At its peak, Marie was a large hurricane with tropical storm-force winds covering an area 575mi (925km) across.|$|E

These secretory antibodies (<b>SAbs)</b> may bind multiple antigens and {{are thought to}} eliminate commensal bacteria and self-antigens to avoid systemic recognition. In this study, we addressed the role of "innate" <b>SAbs,</b> i. e., those that are continuously produced in normal individuals, in protection against infection of the gastrointestinal tract. We used polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR-/-) knock-out mice, which are unable to bind and actively transport dimeric IgA and pentameric IgM to the mucosae, and examined the role of innate <b>SAbs</b> in protection against the invasive pathogen Salmonella typhimurium. In vitro experiments suggested that innate IgA in pIgR-/- serum bound S. typhimurium in a cross-reactive manner which inhibited epithelial cell invasion. Using a "natural" infection model, we demonstrated that pIgR-/- mice are profoundly sensitive to infection with S. typhimurium via the fecal-oral route and, moreover, shed more bacteria that readily infected other animals. These results imply an important evolutionary role for innate <b>SAbs</b> in protecting both {{the individual and the}} herd against infections, and suggest that the major role of <b>SAbs</b> may be {{to prevent the spread of}} microbial pathogens throughout the population, rather than protection of local mucosal surfaces.

Runtime: 57 : 50 minutes. Synthetic Antigen Binders (<b>sABs)</b> are {{a new class of}} antibody-based reagents engineered using novel phage display libraries. Using the power of phage display selection, it is possible generate <b>sABs</b> that : 1) target specific regions on the surface of a protein, 2) recognize specific conformational or oligomeric states, 3) induce conformational changes, and 4) capture and stabilize multi-protein complexes. Using these attributes, we can generate <b>sABs</b> that have their own functional properties and when introduced into cells can alter biological processes in defined ways. We have also employed them as crystallization chaperones to capture proteins in their most relevant states. As an example, the structure of the full-length KcsA potassium channel in both its closed and open states will be discussed. Further, we have also developed a cell delivery system that provides for introducing fully functional <b>sABs</b> into the cytoplasm for live cell imaging applications and to selectively alter cellular function...|$|R

40|$|Eukaryotic cells {{strictly}} {{regulate the}} structure and assembly of their actin filament networks in response to various stimuli. The actin binding proteins that control filament assembly are therefore attractive targets for {{those who wish to}} reorganize actin filaments and reengineer the cytoskeleton. Unfortunately, the naturally occurring actin binding proteins include only a limited set of pointed-end cappers, or proteins that will block polymerization from the slow-growing end of actin filaments. Of the few that are known, most are part of large multimeric complexes that are challenging to manipulate. We describe here the use of phage display mutagenesis to generate of a new class of binding protein that can be targeted to the pointed-end of actin. These proteins, called synthetic antigen binders (<b>sABs),</b> are based on an antibody-like scaffold where sequence diversity is introduced into the binding loops using a novel "reduced genetic code" phage display library. We describe effective strategies to select and screen for <b>sABs</b> that ensure the generated <b>sABs</b> bind to the pointed-end surface of actin exclusively. From our set of pointed-end binders, we identify three <b>sABs</b> with particularly useful properties to systematically probe actin dynamics: one protein that caps the pointed end, a second that crosslinks actin filaments, and a third that severs actin filaments and promotes disassembly...|$|R

25|$|During {{the first}} {{interval}} of time, an object is in motion from point A to point B. Undisturbed, it {{would continue to}} point c during the second interval. When the object arrives at B, it receives an impulse directed toward point S. The impulse gives it a small added velocity toward S, such that if this were its only velocity, it would move from B to V during the second interval. By the rules of velocity composition, these two velocities add, and point C is found by construction of parallelogram BcCV. Thus the object's path is deflected by the impulse so that it arrives at point C {{at the end of}} the second interval. Because the triangles SBc and SBC have the same base SB and the same height Bc or VC, they have the same area. By symmetry, triangle SBc also has the same area as triangle <b>SAB,</b> therefore the object has swept out equal areas <b>SAB</b> and SBC in equal times.|$|E
