Of the sheep shorn 5 days or less 12. 2 per cent. died, but of those shorn 8 to 12 days prior to the storm only 0. 7 per cent. died. Losses were higher in Merino flocks than in crossbreds.

40|$|Akabane virus (AKAV) is {{recognized}} as an important pathogen that causes abortions and congenital malformations in ruminants. However, it has not received adequate attention in Nigeria. Therefore, in investigating this disease, serum samples from 184 (abattoir and farm) head of cattle and 184 intensively reared sheep from two states in southwest Nigeria were screened for antibodies against AKAV using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. An overall seropositivity of 70. 1 % (129 / 184) was obtained with antibodies being detectable in 73. 8 % of abattoir (trade) cattle and 40. 0 % in farm cattle, while 4. 3 % (8 / 184) seropositivity was observed in <b>sheep.</b> <b>All</b> the <b>age</b> groups of cattle tested had seropositive animals, 0 - 1 year (1 / 7, 14. 3 %), 2 - 3 years (17 / 34, 50. 0 %), 4 - 5 years (92 / 121, 76. 0 %), and > 5 years (19 / 22, 86. 4 %), while in sheep only the age groups of 2 - 3 and 4 - 5 years showed seropositivity of 4. 1 % (4 / 97) and 8. 2 % (4 / 49), respectively. The detection of antibody-positive animals among unvaccinated cattle and sheep provides evidence of AKAV infection in Nigeria. These findings call for continuous monitoring of the disease among ruminants in order to ascertain the actual burden and increase awareness of the disease. This will facilitate early detection and aid the development of appropriate control measures against the disease in Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|Ovine {{pulmonary}} adenocarcinoma is a contagious {{viral disease}} of sheep {{that results in}} pulmonary neoplasia in some animals. The economic impact can be significant: up to 80 % of the flock can be lost upon first exposure to the virus, with continuing losses that may {{be as high as}} 20 % each year in some flocks. Excluding this disease from a flock is difficult, in part because no diagnostic test can detect animals in the preclinical stage. No effective treatment or vaccine is available, and eradication is challenging. Currently, ovine pulmonary adenomatosis exists in most sheep-raising areas of the world, with the exception of New Zealand and Australia. Iceland is the only country to have successfully eradicated this disease. Etiology Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma results from infection by jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus (JSRV), which is also known as the pulmonary adenomatosis virus. This virus {{is a member of the}} genus Betaretrovirus in the Retroviridae. Species Affected Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma mainly affects domesticated sheep (Ovis aries). Sardinian moufflon (Ovis musimon, a species of wild sheep) can also become ill, and a few cases have been reported in domesticated goats. Geographic Distribution Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma can be found in sheep-raising countries in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. This disease does not occur in Australia or New Zealand. It has been eradicated from Iceland. Transmission Ovine pulmonary adenocarcinoma can be transmitted by the respiratory route, probably via aerosols or droplets. Infectious virus occurs in the respiratory exudates of infected sheep. Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus can be found in tumors, lung fluids, peripheral blood leucocytes and lymphoid organs; before tumors develop, the virus is detected in lymphoreticular cells. Horizontal transmission has been demonstrated among <b>sheep</b> of <b>all</b> <b>ages,</b> but neonates seem to be particularly susceptible to infection. There is no evidence that in utero transmission is significant in the epidemiology of this disease; however, recent studies suggest that JSRV might be spread in milk or colostrum. Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus does not survive for long periods in the environment...|$|R

40|$|Cellular and ultrastructural {{location}} of angiotensinogen in rat and sheep kidney. Recent evidence suggests {{the involvement of}} a local renin-angiotensin system in some renal actions of angiotensin II (Ang II). In this study the renal distribution of the precursor to angiotensin formation, angiotensinogen, was investigated in rats and sheep using immunohistochemistry, immunoelectron microscopy and non-isotopic hybridization histochemistry. Immunostaining for angiotensinogen was seen in proximal tubules (PCT) of both rat and sheep kidneys. In the rat the strongest immunostaining {{was found in the}} kidneys of neonatal (1 day old) rats. Staining declined after birth. Non-isotopic hybridization histochemistry using oligodeoxynucleotide probes labeled with biotin confirmed the presence of angiotensinogen mRNA expression in PCT of the rat renal cortex. Electron microscopic immunohistochemistry using antibodies raised against rat angiotensinogen showed weak staining in the adult of granule-like structures close to the apical membrane of PCT cells. In the neonatal rat kidney, angiotensinogen immunostaining was found throughout the PCT cells and was markedly stronger than that seen in adult rat kidney. In sheep, angiotensinogen immunostaining with an antibody raised against purified ovine angiotensinogen showed staining of PCT in fetal, newborn and adult sheep kidney. The strongest immunostaining seen was in fetal sheep kidney with a decline seen after birth. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that angiotensinogen mRNA was expressed in the <b>sheep</b> kidney at <b>all</b> <b>ages</b> studied. Angiotensinogen expression was higher in fetal sheep kidneys (77 day and 141 day gestation) than in adult sheep kidney. In conclusion, angiotensinogen mRNA expression was detected in both rat and sheep kidneys. Immunostaining showed angiotensinogen protein in PCT cells of the renal cortex. Angiotensinogen staining and mRNA expression is highest during development and declines in the adult...|$|R
