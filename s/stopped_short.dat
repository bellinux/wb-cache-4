5|$|Kagame's {{relations}} with the US and UK have come under strain in the early 2010s, following allegations that Rwanda is supporting the M23 rebel movement in Eastern Congo. The UK suspended its budgetary aid programme in 2012, freezing a £21million donation. The US has also frozen some of its military aid programme for Rwanda, although it <b>stopped</b> <b>short</b> of suspending aid altogether.|$|E
5|$|Brazil revoked its {{neutrality}} in the {{war between}} the United States and Germany on 1 June 1917, but did not declare war. At the same time, all German merchant ships interned in Brazilian harbors, 45 in all, were boarded and seized; most were unusable due to neglect or sabotage. On 28 June, Brazil revoked its neutrality between all of the Allied and Central Powers but again <b>stopped</b> <b>short</b> of declaring war; this move allowed Brazilian merchantmen to travel in Allied convoys.|$|E
5|$|Indiana's Jermaine Chaney fielded the post-score kickoff and {{returned}} it 51yards, setting up Indiana inside Tech territory. On the Hoosiers' first play, Paci completed a 34-yard pass to tight end Ross Hales for Indiana's second first down of the game. Just outside the Tech 10-yard line, Indiana was <b>stopped</b> <b>short</b> and prevented from scoring a touchdown. Indiana's head coach sent in placekicker Bill Manolopolous, whose 26-yard kick soared through the uprights and cut Virginia Tech's lead to 1410 with 8:47 remaining before halftime.|$|E

5|$|Pablo Miño was {{released}} from prison, but Curto refused to release García, saying that Miño had extenuating circumstances which García did not. Miño's job was to give García the required tools, not to do the maintenance. He was in the street, watching over the van, which was not properly parked and locked, and did not see García's work before the explosion. Curto <b>stopped</b> <b>short</b> of pronouncing Miño innocent at that early stage.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 16-yard line, and Casey completed a quick 14-yard pass to Purdham for a first down. But Tech was unable to gain another first down, and after four plays were <b>stopped</b> <b>short,</b> Tech turned the ball over to Miami after Casey threw an incomplete pass on fourth down. Miami {{received the}} ball with 1:24 remaining and ran a series of inconsequential plays to draw down the clock and bring the game to an end. Miami earned the win, 2010.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the growing threat to the Australian base, the {{decision}} was made to reinforce FSB Andersen, with C Company, 3 RAR flown in by the time of the second attack two nights later. The APCs had also been redeployed to cover the south-east ridge and the southern approach from Trang Bom. The communist assault commenced just before midnight on 19 February, this time focussing on the south-east, and was preceded by heavy machine-gun fire. The attack was <b>stopped</b> <b>short</b> of the wire, regardless the forward pits were hit by rifle grenades, while the Assault Pioneer positions were attacked with satchel charges. The only casualties were four Viet Cong killed.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1957, Nasser nationalized all {{remaining}} British and French {{assets in}} Egypt, including the tobacco, cement, pharmaceutical, and phosphate industries. When efforts to offer tax incentives and attract outside investments yielded no tangible results, he nationalized more companies and made them {{a part of his}} economic development organization. He <b>stopped</b> <b>short</b> of total government control: two-thirds of the economy was still in private hands. This effort achieved a measure of success, with increased agricultural production and investment in industrialization. Nasser initiated the Helwan steelworks, which subsequently became Egypt's largest enterprise, providing the country with product {{and tens of thousands of}} jobs. Nasser also decided to cooperate with the Soviet Union in the construction of the Aswan Dam to replace the withdrawal of US funds.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech's first {{possession}} of the half was slightly more successful than Wake Forest's, as the Yellow Jackets drove inside the Deacons' 30-yard line on several passes from Reggie Ball. Again, however, the Tech defense stumbled. Facing a fourth down inside the Wake Forest red zone, Tech elected to attempt to convert the first down rather than punt the ball. Despite needing just one yard to gain another first down, Georgia Tech was <b>stopped</b> <b>short</b> of the line. The play {{was typical of the}} third quarter, which saw both teams fail to score.|$|E
5|$|On the Seminoles' first {{offensive}} {{play of the}} drive, {{they attempted}} a flea flicker pass, which was caught by Warrick at the Virginia Tech 33-yard line for a 33-yard gain. Following the play, Weinke was sacked {{for the first time}} by the Tech defense. This was followed immediately by Tech's second sack, which pushed Weinke back into the Seminoles' side of the field. On the third play of the Seminole drive, Weinke attempted to scramble for yardage, but was <b>stopped</b> <b>short</b> of the needed mark. Florida State's punt was downed at the Virginia Tech one-yard line, which was where the Tech offense began work. Florida State's defense prevented the Hokies from gaining a first down, and Tech again had to punt from its end zone.|$|E

He <b>stopped</b> <b>short</b> of asking for intervention by federal troops, and McKinley assured a delegation of Kentucky's federal legislators that such intervention would occur only as a last resort. Republican legislators made preparations to heed Taylor's call to convene in London on February 5. Meanwhile, in order to resolve any doubts about the legitimacy of their earlier meeting, Democratic legislators met at the state house—no longer being denied entrance by the state militia—and again voted to adopt the majority report declaring Goebel and Beckham the winners of the election. Both men again took the oath of office.|$|E
5|$|The British 3rd Infantry Division, of I Corps, came ashore on Sword {{beach on}} 6 June 1944, with Caen— inland—as their final objective. The {{vicinity}} of Caen was attractive to Allied planners because it contained airfields and was open, dry and conducive to swift offensive operations, {{for which the}} Allies {{had the advantage of}} numerical superiority in tanks and mobile units. The attempt to capture Caen on D-Day was ambitious and traffic jams on the beaches delayed the 27th Armoured Brigade. The advance of the 3rd Infantry Division diminished as it fought past German fortifications and was <b>stopped</b> <b>short</b> of Caen before dark, by elements of the 21st Panzer Division.|$|E
5|$|The Sleaford Navigation was a 12.5 mile (20.1km) {{canalisation}} of the River Slea in Lincolnshire, England, {{which opened}} in 1794. It ran from a junction with the River Witham, near Chapel Hill {{to the town of}} Sleaford through seven locks, most of which were adjacent to mills. Lack of finance meant that it <b>stopped</b> <b>short</b> of its intended terminus, but it gradually grew to be successful financially. The coming of the railways in 1857 led to a rapid decline, and it was officially abandoned by an act of Parliament in 1878, but remained open for a further three years. The lower part of it remained navigable until the 1940s, when it was blocked by a sluice.|$|E

5|$|The {{first play}} of the {{possession}} resulted in a five-yard penalty against Tech. The second play resulted in the initial first down of the game as Brown completed a 19-yard pass to wide receiver Mike Adams. After the first down, Williams picked up two yards on a running play, but Texas lost that short gain when Brown fumbled the ball during the next play. Brown lost seven yards, but recovered the ball. On third down, Brown attempted to scramble for the first down, but was <b>stopped</b> <b>short</b> {{of the line of}} scrimmage. Texas' punt was fair caught at the 29-yard line, and Virginia Tech began its second possession.|$|E
5|$|Although {{volcanic}} eruptions in Hawaiʻi rarely produce casualties (the only direct historical fatality due to volcanic {{activity on the}} island occurred at Kīlauea in 1924, when an unusually explosive eruption hurled rocks at an onlooker), property damage due to inundation by lava is a common and costly hazard. Hawaiian-type eruptions usually produce extremely slow-moving flows that advance at walking pace, presenting little danger to human life, {{but this is not}} strictly the case; Mauna Loa's 1950 eruption emitted as much lava in three weeks as Kīlauea's current eruption produces in three years and reached sea level within four hours of its start, overrunning the village of Hoʻokena Mauka and a major highway on the way there. An earlier eruption in 1926 overran the village of Hoʻōpūloa Makai, and Hilo, partly built on lavas from the 1880–81 eruption, is at risk from future eruptions. The 1984 eruption nearly reached the city, but <b>stopped</b> <b>short</b> after the flow was redirected upstream.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{legislative}} session, Beshear began to address his agenda related to energy production. In April 2008, {{he announced that}} he would divide the state's Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet to form a new Energy and Environmental Cabinet. The move essentially reversed the consolidation of Environmental, Public Protection, and Labor Cabinets effected under Beshear's predecessor, Ernie Fletcher. Later in the year, Beshear released what he called the state's first-ever comprehensive energy plan. The plan called for expansion of solar, wind, and biomass energy generation, as well as more speculative ventures such as coal gasification and carbon capture and sequestration. Although the plan called for an exploration of the use of nuclear power, Beshear <b>stopped</b> <b>short</b> of advocating an end to the state's ban on the construction of nuclear reactors.|$|E

5|$|Following the missed field goal, Clemson's offense {{started at}} its 25-yard line. On {{the first play}} of the drive, Dantzler {{completed}} a pass to wide receiver Rod Gardner, who ran for 25 yards and a first down at the 50-yard line. A nine-yard shovel pass play {{was followed by a}} run up the middle for a first down at the Tech 37-yard line. Dantzler completed an eight-yard pass, then a running play was <b>stopped</b> <b>short</b> of the first-down marker. On third down, Dantzler faked a quarterback sneak in order to attempt a long pass downfield. Dantzler was unable to pass, however, and was sacked for a four-yard loss. Rather than attempt a field goal or punt the ball, Clemson coach Tommy Bowden had his team attempt to gain a first down. Dantzler scrambled forward, but didn't gain the five yards needed. The Tigers thus turned the ball over on downs at the Tech 28-yard line.|$|E
5|$|In the centre, the 2/15th Infantry Battalion set {{out from}} Katika to capture Nongora on 30 November. They {{advanced}} over broken countryside and after the lead company had crossed the Song River, they were engaged by machine-gun fire from a strong defensive position. This held them up briefly, until the other companies came up. Skirting the position, they continued on towards Nongora where they <b>stopped</b> <b>short</b> of the high ground and established a defensive position for the night. The following morning, the Australians launched a costly and unsuccessful company-level attack against the ridge, but after darkness the Japanese abandoned the position, allowing the 2/15th to occupy it and then clear Nongora on 2 December. Following this, they began sending fighting patrols out towards the Christmas Hills area in the west, and to the east towards the Lakes {{to make contact with}} the 24th Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Janikowski's post-score kickoff was downed for a touchback, and Vick and the Tech offense {{began at}} their 20-yard line. On the Hokies' first play, Davis ran for 16yards and {{a first down}} on an end-around {{similar to the one}} he ran in the first quarter. Despite that success, the Hokies were unable to gain another first down. Appearing to punt the ball away, Tech ran a trick play where the punter {{attempted}} to rush for a first down. He was <b>stopped</b> <b>short</b> of the needed mark, however, and Florida State's offense returned to the field, beginning at the Tech 43-yard line. On the first play after taking over, Weinke completed a 43-yard pass to Warrick for a touchdown. The score and extra point gave Florida State a 4629 lead with 7:42 remaining in the game.|$|E
