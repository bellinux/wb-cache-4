25|$|An intra-universe {{wormhole}} (a wormhole {{between two}} {{points in the}} same universe) is a compact region of spacetime whose boundary is topologically trivial, but whose interior is not simply connected.

500|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{identify}} the influence of Kafka's legal background and the role of law in his fiction. Most interpretations identify aspects of law and legality as important in his work, in which the legal system is often oppressive. The law in Kafka's works, rather than being representative of any particular legal or political entity, is usually interpreted to represent a collection of anonymous, incomprehensible forces. These are hidden from the individual but control the lives of the people, who are innocent victims of systems beyond their control. Critics who support this absurdist interpretation cite instances where Kafka describes himself in conflict with an absurd universe, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> entry from his diary: ...|$|E
