Drilled <b>shaft</b> <b>bore</b> piles measuring 1.2 m in diameter and 90 m in length with a spacing of 3.6 m were suspended within a 6.5 m to 7.5 m thick mat foundation system designed to resist wind and seismic loads.

40|$|This is {{the final}} version of the article. Available from Elsevier via the DOI in this record. Boreability can be defined as the ability of a bore to {{penetrate}} a rock mass. Understanding the factors influencing boreability is critical for enhanced project planning and reduce geotechnical risk in an offshore <b>shaft</b> <b>boring</b> environment. Large diameter drills are used for offshore <b>shaft</b> <b>boring,</b> which can be up to 7 m in diameter, and therefore more akin to tunnel boring machines due to the scale of the excavation and extent of ground interaction. With increases in bore diameter, there is a need to properly define and evaluate the effect of the degree of rock mass fracturing on machine performance for improved estimates of boreability. Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) simulation has been used as an innovative approach for stochastic realisation of rock mass fracturing by determination of the P 32 volumetric fracture intensity in the context of boreability. P 32 shows positive trend to specific penetration (SP), with maximum SP being achieved at moderate to high fracturing levels (20 - 25 m- 1). However, in this case, P 32 shows a similar positive trend to P 10, but with peak SP appearing at higher intensity levels. Increased RQD values result in reduced SP, with peak SP reached at moderate fracturing levels, similar to P 10. This research is part of a wider study into excavatability, funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (ESPRC) of the UK...|$|R

Work summarized is comprised of three parts: Initial prediction using existing rock physical property information; Measurement of additional rock physical properties; and Revision of the initial predictions using the enhanced database. The performance predictions are based on theoretical and empirical relationships between rock properties and the forces-experienced by rock cutters and bits during excavation. Machine backup systems and excavation design aspects, such as curves and grades, are considered in determining excavator utilization factors. Instanteous penetration rate, advance rate, and cutter costs are the fundamental performance indicators...|$|R

40|$|Ribbed {{bored piles}} {{are known to}} give {{increased}} shaft capacity in comparison to conventional straight <b>shafted</b> <b>bored</b> piles. The commercial benefit of greater pile capacity is cheaper foundations. Significant environmental benefits will also accrue {{from the use of}} efficient foundations that are able to carry higher load, leading to less excavation and spoil removal requiring disposal, and reduced concrete in construction. Moreover, redevelopment of urban sites often requires removal of existing deep foundations owing to clashes in position of old and new foundations. Higher capacity piles offer potential for greater flexibility in foundation layout owing to their reduced size, making them easier to install around existing piles. This paper describes a series of tests conducted using the City University London Geotechnical Centrifuge. The tests show that concentrically ribbed piles can provide an increase in capacity of about 30 % when compared with plain piles. Furthermore, ribbed piles provided a greater capacity than that of a pile with a diameter equal to that of the rib diameter...|$|R

40|$|In {{continuation}} of the earlier investigation on the IGB failure of a helicopter (NAL Report No: MT-FA- 937 - 06 - 2005), a few more components were examined to establish the cause of excessive load on the gears. Observations revealed that the driving gear failure was initiated due to minute oscillatory motion (slip) between the <b>shaft</b> and the <b>bore</b> of the roller bearing (45 mm inner dia). This was evident from the fretting on the driving gear shaft {{as well as the}} inner race of the roller bearing. Analysis suggests that excessive surface undulations on the <b>shaft</b> and/or <b>bore</b> of the bearing would have promoted fretting. The excessive load on the tooth flank appears to be due to slip between the shaft and the roller bearing. This slip would have also resulted in improper meshing of the gears...|$|R

40|$|Through {{the past}} years {{unexpectedly}} large settlements {{of the existing}} structures have been registered {{as a result of}} geotechnical site works, and especially, due to the boring and installation of steel core piles. One of the recognized effects related to the bored piles which may lead to the settlements, is remoulding and reconsolidation of soft clay in a limited zone around the pile shaft during installation phase. The radial extent of the remoulded clay around the <b>bored</b> <b>shaft</b> remains unknown, but the pore pressure measurements from recent projects indicate that installation of <b>bored</b> <b>shafts</b> may have larger impact on the surrounding soft soil than what is known for the driven piles. During the past decades, large amount of research has been done on the effects of pile driving and axial capacity of driven piles. The research has resulted in several analytical and numerical methods for prediction of strains, stress changes and consolidation times due to the installation of driven piles. Contrary to the driven piles, there is fairly limited amount of research dealing with the effects of <b>bored</b> <b>shaft</b> installation. Through an extensive laboratory test programme, the thesis investigates how installation of <b>bored</b> <b>shafts</b> may affect strength and compressibility properties of the surrounding soft soils. The simulation of pile installation effects is achieved by subjecting different clay types to different levels of pre-straining through extrusion. The strength and compressibility properties of pre-strained samples are respectively evaluated by falling cone and oedometer testing. The same tests are also carried out on manually remoulded material. Furthermore, an attempt is made to identify the correlation between different levels of reconsolidation stresses and increase in shear strength of pre-strained reconsolidated samples, as well as volume changes due to the reconsolidation. The laboratory test programme also includes index and oedometer tests on undisturbed samples of the same clay types...|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} to estimate <b>shaft</b> capacity of <b>bored</b> piles in sandy soils, based on numerical analysis, is presented. The topic is relevant as current design methods often largely underestimate the shaft capacity of piles in sands, thus resulting in an over-conservative design. The proposed approach is based on explicitly modelling the thin cylinder of soil surrounding the pile, where strain localization concentrates (shear band), and on the fundamental mechanic behaviour of sandy soils (e. g. dilatancy, softening). This approach is both simple and easy to apply. Results of a broad parametric study involving axially loaded single piles embedded in different sandy soils are presented, highlighting that relative density and grain size distribution mainly affect the shaft capacity. The capability of the procedure to predict shaft friction is checked against data from a well-documented full-scale axial load test on instrumented pile. Some suggestions for calibration and application of the method are also reported. Â© 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
