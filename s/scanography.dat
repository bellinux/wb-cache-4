5000|$|<b>Scanography</b> (also spelled scannography), more {{commonly}} referred to as scanner photography, is the process of capturing digitized images of objects for the purpose of creating printable art using a flatbed [...] "photo" [...] scanner with a CCD (charge-coupled device) array capturing device. Fine art <b>scanography</b> differs from traditional document scanning by using atypical objects, often three-dimensional, as well as from photography, {{due to the nature of}} the scanner's operation.|$|E
50|$|Strip {{photography}} can be {{used for}} artistic effect, which has been done regularly since the 1960s. In addition to sports, early examples include work by Silk and other Life (later Time-Life) photographers for various subjects, such as the cover of the Halloween issue of Life 1960. William Larson pioneered modern artistic uses of strip photography from the late 1960s. Michael Golembewski has been a noted practitioner of <b>scanography.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Another {{way to take}} {{images of}} very small objects, [...] "extreme macro", is to use an {{ordinary}} flatbed scanner. This is {{a variation on the}} shift technique in which the object is turned upside down and placed on the scanner, scanned, moved over and scanned again. This produces stereos of a range objects as large as about 6" [...] across down to objects as small as a carrot seed. This technique goes back to at least 1995. See the article <b>Scanography</b> for more details.|$|E
40|$|Background/Objective: Exploring the {{association}} between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), temporomandibular joint (TMJ) <b>scanography</b> and clinical manifestations of joint pain and sounds in patients with temporomandibular (TM) disorder. Patients and Methods: This study included 62 TM joints with internal derangement. Sagittal <b>scanography</b> and MRI of these TMJs were obtained and reported blindly by the consensus of two radiologists. Results: No significant association was observed between clinical and scanographic findings with MRI. The abnormal range of motion had significant relationship with pain (P= 0. 017) and sound (P= 0. 046). There was a strong association between sound and condylar flattening (P= 0. 007). Conclusion: It was demonstrated that joint pain and sounds were predictors of the abnormal range of motion in TMJ <b>scanography.</b> Sound could be heard more often in patients with condylar flattening, and TMJ scanographic findings as well as joint pain and sounds had limited value in the diagnosis of disk position or effusion...|$|E

40|$|A 62 -year-old man who wasdiagnos ed ashaving a bladder tumor by {{computerized}} tomography in another hospital. On August 4, 2006 he visited our hospital. Cystoscopic examination revealed a submucosal tumor posterior {{to the right}} orifice. Computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed the same findings. Therefore, we considered the possibility of asymptomatic pheochromocytoma of the urinary bladder. 131 I-metaiodoberzyl guanidine <b>scanography</b> showed an abnormal accumulation in the bladder. Endocrinologic examination disclosed an increased level of serum and urinary noradrenalin. Pheochromocytoma of the bladder was diagnosed, and on October 25, 2006 a partial cystectomy and right ureteroneostomy were performed. Histologically, the tumor was pheochromocytoma of the urinary bladder. He hasbeen receiving follow-up clinical observation for 30 monthsfollowing the operation, and there hasnot been any evidence of recurrence...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this study, a {{rare disease}} with {{characteristics}} of spontaneous osteolysis {{of the bone}} is reported. The patient was an eight-year-old male, who was admitted with shortness of breath. The absence of the right clavicle was identified by radiography. However, the change to the right clavicle was not malignant, as indicated by bone <b>scanography.</b> The biopsy of the right cervical rib revealed a number of vascular fibrous tissues and vessels distending and shunting together; however, no cell proliferation was observed. In addition, no acid-fast bacillia or malignant cells were detected in the sample of pleural effusion from the patient. Low hemoglobin (93 g/l) and a slight eleva-tion of alkaline phosphatase levels (133 U/l) were observed; however, the other laboratory examination results were normal. The follow-up investigation and radiotherapy {{results indicated that the}} osteolysis of the skull and the other portion of bone had not worsened. Although it has been reported that> 15 % of patients succumb to this disease, the patient reported in the current study was in a relatively stable condition...|$|E
