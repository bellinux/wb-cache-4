5|$|The episode makes {{references}} to Family Guy itself. When Bonnie, Lois and Cleveland's new girlfriend come to dance at The Drunken Clam, they state {{that they would}} like to make the bar their place to hang out, after Peter grabs Joe's gun and kills himself. It turns out that this was only Peter's imagination as he snaps out of it when Joe starts talking to him; Peter answers that he was having a Scrubs fantasy moment. Quagmire responds to Peter's moment by stating that Scrubs is the best show people are not watching. Cleveland replies that he hates shows that leave the story for a gag or joke, referring to the numerous cutaways Scrubs and Family Guy contain. While in the hospital Peter realizes that Mr. Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, then Mr. Pewterschmidt comes into the room and they both <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> about how their voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters.|$|E
25|$|Huckabee has voiced {{his support}} for self-defense and the Castle Doctrine, and has {{generally}} taken an anti-gun control stance. He believes that the concealed carrying of weapons should be allowed. He has said that whenever he hears people <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> about hunting when referring to the Second Amendment, he realizes {{they do not know}} what they are talking about, because the Second Amendment was to allow an armed citizenry the opportunity to protect themselves in case a tyrannical government ever came into power.|$|E
25|$|Ralf is a hot-blooded {{person that}} only cares for action. He is also {{informal}} when talking with his partners or his commander Heidern although {{he tends to}} <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> in a more formal way. However, he is very determined to accomplish all his missions, normally becoming very sad when he fails, especially when he loses a war. Despite being the counterpart of Clark in many ways, they are always assigned to work together. He is especially protective of any new recruits that come under his command and will try his best to care for them, most notably with Whip.|$|E

25|$|Remi Cadoret {{wrote in}} the American Journal of Psychiatry that the typical age for the {{children}} to <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> about past-life memories (and often violent deaths) was two to four years, and generally they had stopped talking about them by the age of eight years. The descriptions would sometimes be accompanied by unusual behavior such as specific fears, and the children might have a birthmark the same shape as wounds on the body of the deceased person whose life was purportedly being recalled. The children claiming to have lived before might exhibit special skills, such as playing an instrument or speaking a language they appeared not to have learned.|$|E
25|$|The {{sales and}} {{marketing}} stage is closely intertwined with the editorial process. As front cover images are produced, or chapters are edited, sales people may <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> about the book with their customers to build early interest. Publishing companies often produce advanced information sheets that may be sent to customers or overseas publishers to gauge possible sales. As early interest is measured, this information feeds back through the editorial process and may affect the formatting {{of the book and}} the strategy employed to sell it. For example, if interest from foreign publishers is high, co-publishing deals may be established whereby publishers share printing costs in producing large print runs thereby lowering the per-unit cost of the books. Conversely, if initial feedback is not strong, the print-run of the book may be reduced, the marketing budget cut or, in some cases, the book is dropped from publication altogether.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2011, Jawbone {{announced}} (and {{then paused}} production) of its lifestyle tracking system, UP by Jawbone. The UP wristband and accompanying app was first {{announced at the}} TED conference in Scotland in July 2011. Describing the company’s foray into health, Rahman told TechCrunch, “It seems like a big departure, but once we <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> about the things {{it takes to make}} this whole category work, we get into things like making it tiny, having a long battery life, making it fashionable, making it waterproof, working with smartphones, having a rich, visual experience on your smartphone and making it social. This is all stuff we do anyway. It comes back around to the mission of your mobile lifestyle.” Highly anticipated by Jawbone fans and the media, the UP lifestyle tracker and app system launched in November 2011. FastCompany Design reported, “If UP works, it could augur a huge shift in the way we approach weight loss and staying healthy.” Jawbone halted production of the product a month later in response to widespread customer claims of issues with charging, syncing, and in some cases, product failure. The guarantee, offered purchasers of UP full refunds for any reason, even if they wanted to keep their wristbands.|$|E

Phil goes to Portugal and returns a month later with Louise, leading some of Phil's neighbours to suspect that he has murdered Lisa.|$|E

500|$|Death Cab for Cutie {{had been}} {{contacted}} by major labels on-and-off for several years, {{but it was}} only after the proven success of Transatlanticism that they decided to <b>start</b> <b>talking</b> to labels about a potential deal. The fact that they had already achieved considerable success allowed the band to negotiate with a lot of creative freedom. According to their manager Jordan Kurland, the band had spoken to [...] "pretty much all of them", and then decided they were most satisfied with their offer from Atlantic Records. In November 2004, the band signed a “long-term worldwide deal” with Atlantic, leaving their long-time label Barsuk Records. Gibbard stated on the band's official website that nothing would change, except that [...] "next to the picture of Barsuk holding a 7", there will be the letter [...] "A" [...] on both the spine and back of our upcoming albums." [...] After signing to Atlantic, the band was still nervous about corporate economics, and encouraged fans to download its songs from the Internet.|$|E
500|$|Escape was {{recorded}} in 16 days at Battery Studios in London, with Hutchins often writing lyrics in the studio.

Smith's presence is evident on [...] "Friends", whose beat was (according to Hutchins) [...] "nothing like the way it sounded after he got to it". Whodini often argued with the studio personnel; Hutchins said that he [...] "never seen studio sessions like ours. Criticism would be flying around that studio like skyrockets and bullets ... But we knew we got something right when Larry started grabbing his dick, and that was the craziest thing in the world." [...] Smith encouraged Whodini to use a variety of instruments on each track, from Linn LM-1 and Roland TR-707 drum machines to a Fender Jazz Bass.|$|E

500|$|Madonna also enlisted American {{professional}} boxer Mike Tyson to give {{a speech}} that would be used on the track.

[...] She also revealed that she was moved and impressed after seen his HBO-documentary [...] "Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth", directed by Spike Lee and contacted him.

In an interview for Rolling Stone he explained: [...] "I didn't know what the hell I was going there for. I'm just there having a good time and hanging out with Madonna. She has her producer there and I go into the studio and I didn't know if she wanted me to talk or rap.

Oseary confirmed that Madonna looked forward to a 2015 release date for the album. However, on November 28, 2014, two songs titled [...] "Rebel Heart" [...] and [...] "Wash All Over Me" [...] were leaked onto the Internet; the songs were immediately taken down, and Oseary tweeted asking for assistance in finding the source of the leaks.

An aggravated Madonna clarified that the songs were demo versions from earlier recordings; she described the leak as [...] "artistic rape".

Madonna said in a Billboard interview that after the leak she and her team tried to trace it back to the source, but ultimately decided to release the finished songs. Referring to the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack, she was critical of the Internet and explained that the incident led to her securing her laptop and hard drives, and disabling the Wi-Fi.
