Denoting the new k-th rank (resp. crank) moments by N¯k(n) (resp. M¯k(n)), we prove the following inequality {{between the first}} rank <b>and</b> <b>crank</b> moments:M¯ 1 (n) >N¯ 1 (n). This inequality motivates us to study a new counting function, ospt(n), which is equal to M¯ 1 (n) −N¯ 1 (n). We also discuss higher order moments of ranks <b>and</b> <b>cranks.</b> Surprisingly, for every higher order moments of ranks <b>and</b> <b>cranks,</b> the following inequality holds:M¯k(n) >N¯k(n). This extends F. G. Garvanʼs result on the ordinary moments of ranks <b>and</b> <b>cranks...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the design}} of a two degree-of-freedom leg {{mechanism}} is accomplished by a two-stage optimization process. In the first stage, leg dimensions are optimized with respect to three design objectives: minimize (i) leg size, (ii) vertical actuating force, <b>and</b> (iii) peak <b>crank</b> torque for an entire walking cycle. Following the optimization of leg dimensions, in the second stage, spring elements with various placement configurations are considered for further reduction of the actuating force <b>and</b> <b>crank</b> torque. Several tradeoff solutions are obtained and a comparison between variously spring configurations is made. It is shown that the inclusion of spring elements can significantly reduce the actuating force <b>and</b> <b>crank</b> torque...|$|R

The results revealed that the input torque at level 1 of 2 Nm <b>and</b> <b>crank</b> angular at level 2 of 90 degree are favorable parameters for compliant flapper mechanism.

40|$|Connecting rod <b>and</b> <b>crank</b> {{pin bearing}} are {{important}} components of automotive diesel engine. If these components failed, all of engine {{system would be}} shut down. In this research, these components failed during operation. Detail analysis of the failed surface showed that the failure in connecting rod <b>and</b> <b>crank</b> pin bearing was caused by improper lubrication system. Evidence of improper lubrication system was proved by the existence of black scratch <b>and</b> chipping on <b>crank</b> pin bearing which formed by high friction during operation. High friction affects performance of other pistons and therefore bolts of connecting rod experienced dynamic tension load. With repeated load during operation, crack initiated on the bolts and propagated until the bolt could not withstand the load anymore before they are finally broken...|$|R
