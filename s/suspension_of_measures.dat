40|$|SUMMARY: Soil {{micro-organisms}} {{have been}} counted {{by a new}} technique whose essential feature is the <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> <b>measured</b> amounts <b>of</b> soil in a molten agar gel from which small drops are removed and allowed to solidify as thin films on a haemocytometer slide of known depth, The instantaneous gelation of the agar ensures the fixation of the soil constituents in their original distribution. The films are dried and stained in a solution of acetic-aniline blue and permanent preparations made by subsequent dehydration in ethanol and mounting in euparal. If the sus-pension is of known dilution, since films of a definite volume contain a known quantity of soil, differential counts <b>of</b> a <b>measured</b> area <b>of</b> film will yield a quantitative estimate of soil micro-organisms. The distribution of bacteria per microscopic field {{was found to be}} complex. The frequencies of bacterial colonies and of pieces of fungal mycelium form a Poisson series; those of the number of bacteria per colony form a logarithmic series; and those {{of the total number of}} bacteria per field fall into a negative binomial distribution.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} {{measurements were}} obtained for a range <b>of</b> <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> wood pulp fibre flowing through a pipeline. Data were generated over a selected range of flow rates and temperatures from a specially built flow loop. It {{was found that the}} magnitude of the heat transfer coefficient was above water at equivalent experimental conditions at very low fibre concentrations, but progressively decreased until it was below water at slightly higher concentrations. It was found that the heat transfer was affected by varying fibre properties, such as fibre length, fibre flexibility, fibre chemical and mechanical treatment, the variation of fibres from different parts of the tree as well as the different pulping methods used to liberate the fibres from the wood structure. Heat transfer coefficient was decreased with the increasing of fibre flexibility as found by previous workers. In the present investigation properties of fibre and paper are correlated with heat transfer to <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> fibres. Variations in fibre characteristics can be monitored in flowing <b>suspension</b> <b>of</b> fibres by <b>measuring</b> heat transfer coefficient and using those measurements to adjust the degree of fibre refining treatment so that papers made from those fibres are more uniform, more consistent and within product specification.

40|$|Changes in {{the level}} of {{intracellular}} free calcium ([Ca 2 +]i) are associated with the secretion of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity by rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells, a mast cell line. Digital fluorescence ratio imaging of fura- 2 was used to measure [Ca 2 +]i in individual RBL cells. Changes in [Ca 2 +]i that occurred in response to crosslinking of IgE receptors on the cell surface or to application of the Ca 2 + ionophore ionomycin were studied. Stimulation of RBL cells with antigen resulted in rapid increases in [Ca 2 +]i following lag times that varied widely from cell to cell. Simple averaging of the Ca 2 + responses of many cells yielded a gradual response profile that closely resembled that <b>of</b> <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> cells <b>measured</b> in the fluorometer.

This study was directed towards {{the understanding of}} transport properties <b>of</b> flowing <b>suspensions.</b> The {{first part of the}} thesis detailed the experimental study undertaken to investigate the characteristics <b>of</b> flowing <b>suspensions.</b> An experimental method capable <b>of</b> <b>measuring</b> the velocities <b>of</b> both the dispersed and suspending phases <b>of</b> a flowing <b>suspension</b> was first developed. The method was shown to be capable <b>of</b> <b>measuring</b> the velocity distributions <b>of</b> moderately concentrated <b>suspensions.</b> By using a modified laser Doppler anemometer, the velocity distribution of the suspended fluid was approximated by <b>measuring</b> the velocity <b>of</b> small fluorescent tracers, while the scattered signal from the suspended particles gave a direct measurement of their velocity distribution. <b>Suspensions</b> <b>of</b> rigid latex spheres, red blood cells, and ghost red blood cells were used. The observed behavior <b>of</b> the different <b>suspensions</b> were similar. However, the behavior <b>of</b> <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> rigid latex spheres showed a stronger dependence on the concentration of suspended particles, and a dependence on flow rates which was not observed with <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> ghost cells. The second part of the thesis describes the measurements of the effective thermal conductivity <b>of</b> sheared <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> rigid spherical particles. The objective was to verify the theoretical prediction of Leal (1973) for a dilute suspension undergoing shear at low particle Peclet number, and to extend the range of the experiments to conditions beyond the scope of the theory. Surprisingly, reasonable agreement with the theoretical prediction was observed even for <b>suspensions</b> <b>of</b> moderate concentrations ([ [...] . ] 0. 25) and higher Peclet numbers: (Pe ~ 0 (1)).
