They were anesthetized with 5 % benzocaine (BZ- 20 (R), Veterquimica), fixed in 10 % buffered formalin, and embedded in paraffin, Shh polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz H- 160, rabbit) was used diluted at 1 / 100. They were subsequently rinsed in PBS- 1 % Triton and incubated with anti-rabbit conjugated polymer antibody and HRP for 10 - 15 min. The development was done with DAB (Vector) for 1 - 5 min. The negative control was incubated without primary antibody. As an internal positive control the notochord was considered. Serial sagittal sections were analyzed consigning tissues and organs marked positively and were described morphologically. The objective of recognizing the spatial and temporal location of Shh was achieved. The notochord, spinal cord neurons and ganglia, the basal layer of the skin and also the lepidotriquias escleroblastos were positively identified for Shh. Finally positivity was also observed in the intestine and renal tubules.

40|$|Growth of farmed, {{wild and}} F 1 hybrid Atlantic <b>salmon</b> parr, <b>Salmo</b> <b>salar,</b> was {{investigated}} under three contrasting feeding regimes {{in order to}} understand how varying levels of food availability affects relative growth.

Mortality was low in all treatments, and food availability had no effect on survival of all groups. The offspring of farmed S. salar significantly outgrew the wild S. salar, while hybrids displayed intermediate growth. Furthermore, the relative growth differences between the farmed and wild S. salar did not change across feeding treatments, indicating a similar plasticity in response to feed availability.

2500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} myth, most beaver dams do not pose {{barriers}} to trout and salmon migration, {{although they may}} be restricted seasonally during periods of low stream flows. In a meta-review of studies claiming that beaver dams act as fish passage barriers, Kemp et al. found that 78% of these claims were not supported by any data. In a 2013 study of radiotelemetry-tagged Bonneville cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki utah) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) in Utah, both of these fish species crossed beaver dams in both directions, including dams up to [...] high. Rainbow, brown, and brook trout {{have been shown to}} cross as many as 14 consecutive beaver dams. Both adults and juveniles of coho salmon, steelhead trout, sea run cutthroat (Oncorhyncus clarki clarki), Dolly Varden trout (Salvelinus malma malma), and sockeye salmon are able to cross beaver dams. In southeast Alaska, coho jumped dams as high as two meters, were found above all beaver dams and had their highest densities in streams with beaver. In Oregon coastal streams, beaver dams are ephemeral and almost all wash out in high winter flows only to be rebuilt every summer. Migration of adult Atlantic <b>salmon</b> (<b>Salmo</b> <b>salar)</b> may be limited by beaver dams, but the presence of juveniles upstream from the dams suggests that the dams are penetrated by parr. Downstream migration of Atlantic salmon smolts was similarly unaffected by beaver dams, even in periods of low flows.

On the other hand, the relative concentrations of monounsaturated and saturated fatty acids remained constant or slightly increased by a few percent after degradation (e. g., from 10. 7 % to 12. 9 % for palmitic acid). Co-crystallization of ASO with β-CD at a host–guest ratio of 1 : 1 and 3 : 1 from an ethanol–water mixture and kneading methods has been used for the preparation of β-CD/ASO complexes.

Feed was provided in normoxia. One third of the fish were kept further for 30 days in normoxia to study possible compensatory growth. Cyclic hypoxia did not alter the oxygen uptake rates of fish, measured in night-time. Fish subjected to 50 % and 60 % O 2 reduced feeding by 13 % and 6 % compared with the controls, respectively, with corresponding reductions in specific growth rates. Feed utilization was not reduced. Compensatory growth was observed in fish from the 80 : 50 group, but full compensation was not achieved. The main conclusions were that feeding in normoxia does not fully alleviate negative effects of cyclic hypoxia on feeding and growth, when oxygen is reduced to 60 % or below in hypoxic periods, that feed utilization is maintained, and that compensatory growth may lessen negative effects...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Origin and age was {{determined}} for individual fish caught in offshore catches of Atlantic <b>salmon</b> stocks (<b>Salmo</b> <b>salar</b> L.) in the Baltic Sea {{over the years}} 2000 – 2009. DNA microsatellite loci and smolt age were used to probabilistically assign returning spawners to their stock of origin. Data {{for this study were}} based on approximately 2600 catch samples of the five most common wild and four sea-ranched, hatchery-reared stocks. Spawning age, and sex ratio differed both within and between these wild, and sea-ranched groups. The females were mainly (78. 7 %) two sea-winters old and the males usually (68. 7 %) only one sea-winter old. In both sexes, the mean age at maturity was lower in the hatchery-reared, sea-ranched stocks than in naturally reproducing stocks. In the 2000 s, there was a weak decreasing trend in the male spawning age, but not in that of females. The sex-ratio of the spawners was female dominant in the naturally reproducing stocks, but male dominant in hatchery-reared stocks. Published historical data from two of the same rivers suggest that the majority of males were multi-sea-winter spawners in the 1930 s, and variation in the age distribution of the spawners has become narrower and skewed towards a younger age in the present data (2000 – 2009) compared to the earlier situation...|$|R
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of a Baltic <b>salmon</b> stock <b>Salmo</b> <b>salar</b> (Indalsälv, central Sweden) to Norwegian Gyrodactylus salaris (Figga strain, central Norway) was experimentally {{tested and}} compared with previously obtained results on East Atlantic salmon (Lierelva, SE Norway). Contrary to expectation, the Baltic salmon, {{which had no}} prior exposure to this parasite strain, appeared almost as susceptible as the Norwegian salmon parr that naturally experience G. salaris-induced mortality. Individually isolated salmon of both stocks sustained G. salaris infections with little evidence of innate resistance. A few individuals of the Indalsälv stock controlled their infection from the beginning, but overall there was considerable heterogeneity {{in the course of}} infection in both stocks. On individual hosts, G. salaris growth rates declined steadily throughout the infection, a trend which was particularly marked amongst the Lierelva stock. On shoaling Lierelva fish, there was some evidence of reduced parasite population growth {{towards the end of the}} infection; this was not apparent in Indalsälv fishes. These results reflect a growing awareness that not all Baltic salmon may be resistant to Norwegian G. salaris, and that Norwegian and Baltic G. salaris strains may differ in virulence. Consequently, management decisions concerning this parasite-host system should be based upon the actual, and tested, susceptibility of stocks under consideration and not upon identification of stocks as either Atlantic or Baltic...|$|R
40|$|Pathogens are {{increasingly}} emerging in human-altered environments {{as a serious}} threat to biodiversity. In this context of rapid environmental changes, improving our knowledge on the interaction between ecology and evolution is critical. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the influence of an immunocompetence gene, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class IIβ, on the pathogen infection levels in wild Atlantic <b>salmon</b> populations, <b>Salmo</b> <b>salar,</b> and identify selective agents involved in contemporary coevolution. MHC variability and bacterial infection rate were determined throughout the summer in juvenile salmon from six rivers belonging to different genetic and ecological regions in Québec, Canada. A total of 13 different pathogens were identified in kidney by DNA sequence analysis, including a predominant myxozoa, most probably recently introduced in North America. Infection rates were the highest in southern rivers at the beginning of the summer (average 47. 6 ± 6. 3 % infected fish). One MHC allele conferred a 2. 9 times greater chance of being resistant to myxozoa, while another allele increased susceptibility by 3. 4 times. The decrease in frequency of the susceptibility allele but not other MHC or microsatellite alleles during summer was suggestive of a mortality event from myxozoa infection. These results supported the hypothesis of pathogen-driven selection in the wild by means of frequency-dependent selection or change in selection through time and space rather than heterozygous advantage, and underline the importance of MHC standing genetic variation for facing pathogens in a changing environment...|$|R

Over the period 2009 - 2013 70 % (n = 628) of the smolts were detected. Numbers of smolts reaching the North sea varied per year, with a minimum of 0 % and a maximum of 15 % of the detected fish. The route prevailingly used to migrated to sea by way of the Haringvliet. Duration of smolt migration was mostly less than one month, with average migration speeds always below 1. 2 m/s. The influence of the hydro power station (HPS) Linne on the migration was examined. Yearly mortality per km of smolts, over the river stretch Linne – Lith (130 km) turned out to be higher especially in a short distance downstream of the HPS, indicating a vulnerability of the species which is higher for passing the hydropower station than for passing the weir. Also attention was paid on losses by predation of Cormorants...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} {{environmental impacts}} of large-scale storage hydroelectric power (HEP) schemes have been well-documented in the literature. In Europe, awareness of these potential impacts and limited opportunities for politically-acceptable medium- to large-scale schemes, have caused attention to focus on smaller-scale HEP schemes, particularly run-of-river (ROR) schemes, to contribute to meeting renewable energy targets. Run-of-river HEP schemes are often presumed to be less environmentally damaging than large-scale storage HEP schemes. However, there is currently a lack of peer-reviewed studies on their physical and ecological impact. The aim {{of this article was}} to investigate the effects of ROR HEP schemes on communities of fish in temperate streams and rivers, using a Before-After, Control-Impact (BACI) study design. The study makes use of routine environmental surveillance data collected as part of long-term national and international monitoring programmes at 23 systematically-selected ROR HEP schemes and 23 systematically-selected paired control sites. Six area-normalised metrics of fish community composition were analysed using a linear mixed effects model (number of species, number of fish, number of Atlantic <b>salmon</b> - <b>Salmo</b> <b>salar,</b> number of > 1 year old Atlantic salmon, number of brown trout - Salmo trutta, and number of > 1 year old brown trout). The analyses showed that there was a statistically significant effect (p< 0. 05) of ROR HEP construction and operation on the number of species. However, no statistically significant effects were detected on the other five metrics of community composition. The implications of these findings are discussed in this article and recommendations are made for best-practice study design for future fish community impact studies...|$|R

A case study of wild Atlantic <b>salmon</b> parr (<b>Salmo</b> <b>salar)</b> showed that: most growth took place in a 10 -week period in spring, at temperatures below those that previous published models report as necessary for rapid growth and at faster rates than the maximum that previous models predicted. 4. Temperature and fish size allometry explained 45 % of growth variation, but the effects of temperature were significantly and markedly different at different seasons. 5. Seasonal effects explained an additional 18 % of the variation and were strongly associated with the abundance of potential 'drift' food. 6. The seasonal patterns for growth in length and weight were different, implying differential allocation of resources to structural and reserve tissues. 7. The growth patterns of sexually maturing male parr and emigrants also differed in comparison to other parr. 8. Condition factor, length at first capture and seasonal interactions with both early maturity and smolting explained another 7 % of the variation. 9. However, individual fish did not grow consistently better, or worse, than the 'average' fish. 10.
