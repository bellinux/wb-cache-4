He was a cross-community worker who helped steer young people away from violence. The LVF said it was revenge for the killing of Billy Wright.|$|E

6000|$|The Buriat went inside; he {{returned}} {{in two or}} three minutes. [...] "My wife will stay; my sister and the attendant will go." [...] Then he called to the men who were <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of their huts: ...|$|R
60|$|Here, <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> {{of their}} houses, were {{many of the}} {{inhabitants}} who had gathered to watch us pass. Never did I see hate more savage than was written on those faces as they shook their fists at us and muttered curses not loud but deep.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Jobson {{turned and}} eyed his wife, who was <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E

60|$|The great {{gates of}} the {{courtyard}} stood uninjured, but <b>the</b> postern <b>door</b> had been battered in.

6000|$|Now, {{the road}} to Mosfell runs past Middalhof and thither he came. Atli, <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> men's <b>door,</b> saw him and cried aloud: [...] "Ho! a mighty man comes here." ...|$|R
60|$|At 5 A.M. Carl was <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> saloon <b>door.</b> When <b>the</b> {{bartender}} {{opened it}} Carl bounced in, slightly dizzy, {{conscious of the}} slime of mud on his fraying trouser-ends.|$|R

60|$|Beric went below, aroused his countrymen, {{and went}} with them and Boduoc. The streets were alive.

The sound of military trumpets calling the soldiers to arms rose in various parts of the city, and mingled with the hoarse sound of the watchmen's horns. As they approached the fire the crowd became thicker.|$|R
6000|$|... "She, <b>standing</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> saw me, {{and thought}} I [...] made, as I {{certainly}} did, a most awkward, ridiculous [...] appearance" [...] 48 ...|$|E
