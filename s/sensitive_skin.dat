25|$|Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea {{exhibits}} permanent redness (erythema) with {{a tendency}} to flush and blush easily. It is also common to have small, widened blood vessels visible near {{the surface of the}} skin (telangiectasias) and possibly intense burning, stinging, or itching. People with this type often have <b>sensitive</b> <b>skin.</b> Skin can also become very dry and flaky. In addition to the face, signs can also appear on the ears, neck, chest, upper back, and scalp.|$|E
25|$|Titanium dioxide {{is found}} in the {{majority}} of physical sunscreens because of its high refractive index, its strong UV light absorbing capabilities and its resistance to discolouration under ultraviolet light. This advantage enhances its stability and ability to protect the skin from ultraviolet light. Nano-scaled (particle size of 30–40nm) titanium dioxide particles are primarily used in sun screen lotion because they scatter visible light less than titanium dioxide pigments while still providing UV protection. Sunscreens designed for infants or people with <b>sensitive</b> <b>skin</b> are often based on titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide, as these mineral UV blockers are believed to cause less skin irritation than other UV absorbing chemicals.|$|E
25|$|The same {{precautions}} {{that apply}} to cosmetics should be observed. If the skin shows any sign of allergy from a paint, its use should immediately be ceased. Moreover, {{it should not be}} applied to damaged, inflamed or <b>sensitive</b> <b>skin.</b> If possible, a test for allergic reaction should be performed before use. Special care should be paid to the list of ingredients, as certain dyes are not approved by the US FDA for use around the eye area—generally those associated with certain reddish colorants, as CI 15850 or CI 15985—or on lips, generally blue, purple or some greens containing CI 77007. More stringent regulations are in place in California regarding the amount of permissible lead on cosmetic additives, as part of Proposition 65. In the European Union, all colorants listed under a CI number are allowed for use on all areas. Any paints or products which have not been formulated for use on the body should never be used for body or face painting, as these can result in serious allergic reactions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{bites of}} Forcipomyia taiwana (F. taiwana) cause {{swelling}} and pruritus in <b>sensitive</b> <b>skins,</b> {{and are often}} prevented by synthetic repellents. The commercially available repellents are composes of N,N-diethyl- 3 -methylbenzamide, long-term use of which may results in negative influence on skins as well as nervous and immune systems. This study first examines how different organic solvents influence on the repellent effect on F. taiwana, after which solvents are used for the extraction of Cinnamomum osmophloeum Kaneh, Cymbopogon excavates, Mentha, Rosmarinus officinalis, Salvia officinalis, and Eucalyptus globulus. The plant extracts are tested for their repellent effect on F. taiwana with a Y-tube test. The experiment results show that of all solvents, only water attracts F. taiwana, furthermore, with water as the solvent, except for Eucalyptus globulus, all the other plant extracts, are repellent to F. taiwana...|$|R

40|$|Albinism is a {{relatively}} common genetic condition in Zimbabwe, a tropical country in southern Africa. Those affected have little pigment in their hair, skin or eyes, {{in sharp contrast to}} the normal dark pigmentation. This article describes the responses to a self-report questionnaire covering health, social and educational aspects completed by 138 schoolchildren with albinism living in rural areas of Zimbabwe. They reported persistent skin and a myriad of eye problems. Relationships between siblings appeared good, although problems of antagonism, avoidance and fear were encountered among strangers. Knowledge about albinism was patchy; pupils were keen to be better informed. This research highlights the need for widespread dissemination of accurate information about the genetics and health management of albinism to counter the many myths and misconceptions surrounding this condition. A management programme to promote the health and education of these children in southern Africa is proposed. In conclusion, this study indicated that pupils with albinism could participate in mainstream education, with appropriate intervention to help them manage the problems associated with their low vision and <b>sensitive</b> <b>skins...</b>|$|R
40|$|Surfaces {{are often}} {{held to be}} of lesser {{consequence}} than ‘deeper’ or more ‘substantive’ aspects of artworks and objects. Yet {{it is also possible}} to conceive of the surface in more positive terms: as a site where complex forces meet. Surfaces can be theorized as membranes, protective shells, <b>sensitive</b> <b>skins,</b> even thicknesses in their own right. The surface {{is not so much a}} barrier to content as an opportunity for encounter: in new objects, the surface is the site of qualities of finish, texture, the site of tactile interaction, the last point of contact between object and maker, and the first point of contact between object and user. Surface tensions includes sixteen essays that explore this theoretically uncharted terrain. The subjects range widely: domestic maintenance; avant-garde fashion; the faking of antiques; postmodern architecture and design; contemporary film costume. Of particular emphasis within the volume are textiles, which are among the most complex and culturally rich materialisations of surface. As a whole, the book provides insights into the whole lifecycle of objects, not just their condition when new...|$|R

60|$|I, too, was busy, {{trying to}} reason {{out how he}} was aware of the {{existence}} of so intangible a thing as a shadow.

Or, perhaps,—who can tell?—it was that fabled sixth sense which conveyed to him the loom and feel of an object close at hand.|$|E
60|$|In {{other and}} more {{sensible}} directions I sought also to progress. Gradually I was overcoming my shyness. It {{was a slow}} process.

60|$|The soft, naked, <b>sensitive</b> <b>skin</b> of man, entirely {{free from}} that hairy {{covering}} {{which is so}} universal among other mammalia, cannot be explained on the theory of natural selection. The habits of savages show that they feel the want of this covering, which is most completely absent in man exactly where it is thickest in other animals. We have no reason whatever to believe, {{that it could have}} been hurtful, or even useless to primitive man; and, under these circumstances, its complete abolition, shown by its never reverting in mixed breeds, is a demonstration of the agency of some other power than the law of the survival of the fittest, in the development of man from the lower animals.|$|E
30|$|We {{also noticed}} several {{additional}} technical {{difficulties in the}} core of our study related to the color of the skin and light conditions offered by a standard examination room. In principle, the system should not be <b>sensitive</b> to <b>skin</b> color and potential reflections of light. For example, scars on the skin at the location of the lumpectomy change local imaging features. Temporary markers on the breast necessary for radiotherapy treatment may also impact surface imaging. Finally, there may be complicated 3 D surfaces with lines of discontinuity due to possible hidden surfaces below the breast.|$|R
50|$|Glycerol is a {{component}} of glycerin soap. Essential oils are added for fragrance.

50|$|Also, dye-sublimation {{papers and}} ribbons are <b>sensitive</b> to <b>skin</b> oils, which {{interfere}} with the dye's ability to sublimate from the ribbon to the paper.

Most dye-sublimation printers have filters and/or cleaning rollers to reduce the likelihood of this happening, and a speck of dust can only affect one print as it becomes attached to the print during the printing process. Finally, dye-sublimation printers fall short when producing neutral and toned black-and-white prints with higher density levels and virtually no metamerism or bronzing.|$|R
60|$|Before that well-nigh hopeless {{journey to}} the coast was half over I became ill--so ill that anyone who had looked on me might well have {{imagined}} that I {{had come to the}} end of my pilgrimage. That was what I feared. For days I remained sunk in the deepest despondence; then, in a happy moment, I remembered how, after being bitten by the serpent, when death had seemed near and inevitable, I had madly rushed away through the forest in search of help, and wandered lost for hours in the storm and darkness, and in the end escaped death, probably by means of these frantic exertions. The recollection served to inspire me with a new desperate courage. Bidding good-bye to the Indian village where the fever had smitten me, I set out once more on that apparently hopeless adventure. Hopeless, indeed, it seemed to one in my weak condition. My legs trembled under me when I walked, while hot sun and pelting rain were like flame and stinging ice to my morbidly <b>sensitive</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{was afraid}} to raise my eyelids, but looked out and saw {{perfectly}} under the lashes. The girl went on her knees, and bent over me, simply gloating. There was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive, and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal, till I {{could see in the}} moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp teeth. Lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of my mouth and chin and seemed to fasten on my throat. Then she paused, and I could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked her teeth and lips, and I could feel the hot breath on my neck. Then the skin of my throat began to tingle as one's flesh does when the hand that is to tickle it approaches nearer, nearer. I could feel the soft, shivering touch of the lips on the super <b>sensitive</b> <b>skin</b> of my throat, and the hard dents of two sharp teeth, just touching and pausing there. I closed my eyes in languorous ecstasy and waited, waited with beating heart.|$|E
60|$|But, on {{the other}} hand, we find {{that every one of}} these {{characteristics}} is necessary for the full development of human nature. The rapid progress of civilization under favourable conditions, would not be possible, were not the organ of the mind of man prepared in advance, fully developed as regards size, structure, and proportions, and only needing a few generations of use and habit to co-ordinate its complex functions. The naked and <b>sensitive</b> <b>skin,</b> by necessitating clothing and houses, would lead to the more rapid development of man's inventive and constructive faculties; and, by leading to a more refined feeling of personal modesty, may have influenced, to a considerable extent, his moral nature. The erect form of man, by freeing the hands from all locomotive uses, has been necessary for his intellectual advancement; and the extreme perfection of his hands, has alone rendered possible that excellence in all the arts of civilization which raises him so far above the savage, and is perhaps but the forerunner of a higher intellectual and moral advancement. The perfection of his vocal organs has first {{led to the formation of}} articulate speech, and then to the development of those exquisitely toned sounds, which are only appreciated by the higher races, and which are probably destined for more elevated uses and more refined enjoyment, in a higher condition than we have yet attained to. So, those faculties which enable us to transcend time and space, and to realize the wonderful conceptions of mathematics and philosophy, or which give us an intense yearning for abstract truth, (all of which were occasionally manifested at such an early period of human history as to be far in advance of any of the few practical applications which have since grown out of them), are evidently essential to the perfect development of man as a spiritual being, but are utterly inconceivable as having been produced through the action of a law which looks only, and can look only, to the immediate material welfare of the individual or the race.|$|E

40|$|Touch plays {{a central}} role in social {{expression}} but, so far, research into social touch behaviors for robots has been almost. non-existent. Embodied machines have the unique capability to sense human body language, which will enable robots to better comprehend, anticipate and respond to their human companions in a natural way. This thesis addresses the novel field of sensate touch by (1) creating the first. robot with full Body sensate touch and with on-screen visualization, (2) establishing a library of salient social gestures through behavioral studies, (3) implementing a first-pass touch gesture recognition system in real-time, an(d (4) running a small pilot study with children to evaluate classifications and test the device's acceptance/utility with humans. Such research is critical path to conceiving and advancing thee use of machine touch to better integrate robots in. to human social environments. All of the above will be incorporated into the huggable robotic teddy bear at the MIT Media Lab's Personal Robotics group and makes use of the <b>Sensitive</b> <b>Skins</b> circuit design created in Dan Stiehl's Masters thesis.
