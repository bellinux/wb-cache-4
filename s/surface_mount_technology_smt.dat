40|$|This paper {{presents}} a visual servoing methodology to realize a vision-based chip mounting, {{which makes it}} possible to mount micro chips to PCB with high precision. Because of continued down-sizing of electronic products, density of electronic parts to be packed into PCBs is ever getting higher and higher, thus requiring <b>surface</b> <b>mounting</b> <b>technologies</b> (<b>SMT)</b> to be more precise and productive. Down-sizing also tends toward miniaturization of components. The increased package density and component miniaturization require not only delicate handling of small chips but also delicate placement of them on PCBs. In order to place the small chips on the pattern of PCB, highly accurate mounting process is ultimately required. This is because it is difficult to place the chips a specified position with tiny small contact force due to uncertainty involved with the kinematic calibration error of the mounter and the deformation of PCB. In this paper, to avoid this difficulty we propose a visual servoing method for the chip mounting system. In such a way, the proposed visual servoing technique guarantees that chips are accurately placed at the desired positions. To achieve this, a CCD camera views the chip mounted with the mark on PCB simultaneously, and then the edge features and corner features are extracted from the acquired image. The proposed visual servoing algorithm generates the motion of the mounter to align the features of the chip with the ones of the mark on PCB on-line.

These are needed for high performance applications as 2. 5 D packages in large-size, and also as ultra-thin packages for consumer applications that are directly assembled on the board {{without the need for}} an intermediate package. The trend to low-CTE packages (CTE of 3 - 8 ppm/°C), however, creates large CTE mismatch with the board on which they are assembled. Interconnection reliability is, therefore, a major concern when low CTE interposers are <b>surface</b> <b>mounted</b> onto organic system boards via solder joints. This reliability concern is further aggravated with large package sizes and finer pitch. For wide acceptance of low CTE packages in high volume production, it is also critical to assemble them on board using standard <b>Surface</b> <b>Mount</b> <b>Technologies</b> (<b>SMT)</b> without the need for under-fill. This research aims to demonstrate reliable 400 micron pitch solder interconnections from low CTE glass interposers directly assembled onto organic boards by overcoming the above challenges using two approaches; 1) Stress-relief dielectric build up layers {{on the back of the}} interposer, 2) Polymer collar around the solder bumps for shear stress re-distribution.

It is used in order to validate experiments, which acknowledge the fact that food remain fresh, if it is stored at certain humidity values. The design, development, and realization of the food container took place in several steps: the fundamental studies at an experimental model with a PC development environment by the IMA, the upgrading in <b>surface</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>technology</b> (<b>SMT)</b> by the indatec GmbH, the upgrading in micro system technology (MST) by the infratec GmbH, and the test of the total system by the IMA.

Due {{to the fact that}} the system is dependent on light a special power management and an energy-saving control algorithm have been designed and low power consuming components have been used. The air humidity inside the container can be changed by opening and closing a ventilation flap actuator. A capacity sensor is used for the measurement of the air humidity. The measurement of the temperature by a thermistor (NTC) serves the compensation of the temperature dependence of this humidity sensor. The signals of both sensors are converted by a switched-capacitor interface. The frequency signals produced this way, which are proportional to air humidity and to temperature respectively are fed back to a microcontroller. Using these signals, the exact humidity in the container is calculated and compared with the desired humidity. The difference signal operates a controller that positions the ventilation flap on the front of the container. The SMT version of the power management and the sensor-actuator-interface as well as a MST component, which includes the sensors and the signal processing hardware around the microcontroller, are closer regarded and explained in detail.

40|$|The recent {{launch of}} high voltage {{switching}} devices of new semiconductor materials such as Silicon Carbide, have shown better performance. This {{makes it possible to}} use the single stage Flyback converter for low to moderate power, high input voltage applications, which is attractive due to its inherent advantages of low cost and simplicity. However, the losses in the Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor-Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) are aggravated due to the high input voltage, which decreases the efficiency. Additionally, the losses in the secondary diode can be considerable, thus deteriorating the efficiency further. With the current trend towards high power density converters, the replacement of through hole component with <b>surface</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>technology</b> (<b>SMT)</b> components for the active devices is often the solution, under the condition that they require minimal thermal management i. e. using SMT components with minimal footprint without heat-sinks. In the light of thermal management it is important to reduce the losses in the active components, thereby effectively decreasing the generation of heat. Therefore, the objective of this thesis is to design a high power density 40 W flyback converter by reducing the losses in the active components. First the nature of the losses are identified theoretically and afterwards the results are verified experimentally. It was found that the switching losses in the primary MOSFET and the conduction losses in the secondary diode are the major loss contributors. To reduce both these losses a synchronous rectification controller was built which ensures zero voltage switching (ZVS) by making the converter bidirectional. The experimental results show that for loads greater than 0. 5 Inominal,, the losses in the active components are reduced effectively to levels which allow the use of SMT component with minimal footprint. For light load conditions the converter showed erratic behavior due to the limited blanking time of the primary controller. To address this issue, a solution was proposed which has proven to work successfully for the voltage range of 400 V- 600 V. Under a few special condition for voltages higher than 600 V, the proposed solution has shown some erratic behavior, which {{is expected to be a}} result of the control loop stability.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a very simple}} and reliable procedure for measuring shape and deformation of electronic components with a single experimental set-up. The procedure is based on two electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) techniques referred to as conventional ESPI and phase shifting ESPI (PS-ESPI). The present research is motivated {{by the fact that}} mismatch in thermal expansion coefficients of the different materials included in electronic packaging (EP) may cause mechanical failures since thermal stresses will change sharply through subsequent loading cycles. ESPI is particularly suitable for measurements on EP since it allows us to perform non–contact testing of non-planar heterogeneous surfaces. It is apparent that gathering detailed topographic information will certainly help us to measure accurately surface deformations of EP along with modeling correctly numerical analysis. As is known, the accuracy of results obtained with ESPI may be significantly improved by phase shifting techniques (PST). Therefore, this paper compares the relative merits of different phase-stepping strategies in order to find which strategy will perform the best for the optical set-up utilized in the experiments. Preliminary investigations on a standard specimen under three-point-bending served to choose properly the optical set-up and phase-stepping procedure which yield the best fringe visibility. Four-phases achieved the best fringe visibility and the minimum number of invalid pixels. These information have been utilized in the experimental campaign on standard and <b>surface</b> <b>mounted</b> <b>technology</b> (<b>SMT)</b> electronic components. ESPI and PS-ESPI have been used for analyzing the transient state and the steady state of devices, respectively. From the experimental results obtained here, it appears possible to measure strains induced by thermal loading cycles. The experimental set-up, based on the Lendeertz’s interferometer, proved itself also able to contour specimen surface at a good level of detail. Remarkably, by using the same set-up for deformation and shape measurements we can preserve the pixel by pixel relationship between displacements and surface depth which will hold true if correlation between different exposures is not destroyed. The results obtained in this research justify using PS-ESPI in order to understand better failure mechanisms of electronic components. This fact along with the exact knowledge of object shape may be particularly useful in the different design stages (including FEM modeling and analysis) of electronics for special applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{testing of}} {{printed circuit board}} (PCB) {{interconnects}} is a complex task that requires enormous amount of resources. With {{the increasing use of}} new <b>technologies</b> like <b>surface</b> <b>mounting</b> <b>technology</b> (<b>SMT),</b> testing PCB interconnects using the available techniques, like in-circuit testing and functional testing, is becoming very difficult. To make testing manageable, it must be considered earlier in the design process. This is known as 'design for testability' (DFT). A hierarchical DFT approach known as boundary scan architecture has recently become an increasingly attractive solution for PCB interconnect testing problems. This framework provides a scan path for electronic access to the interconnect test points, thus removing the need for accessibility through electro-mechanical contacts known as 'bed of nails'. In the recent past, several researchers have proposed different schemes for PCB interconnect testing based on the boundary scan architecture. In this dissertation, a new approach, based on the concept of built-in self-test (BIST), is developed using the boundary scan architecture for PCB interconnect testing. BIST, at the component level, generally consists of incorporating additional circuitry on the chip to generate test patterns and to compact the response of the circuit under test into a reference signature. For the PCB level BIST, the board is considered as the unit under test. A family of BIST schemes are developed for board interconnect testing utilizing the properties of the boundary scan architecture. The BIST approach has removed the dependence on automatic test equipment (ATE) for generation of test vector sets and analysis of output data sets. Techniques are developed for the generation of test vector sets which require very simple test generation hardware. Test vector sets are shown to be independent of the order of the input/output (I/O) scan cells in the boundary scan chain and of the structural complexity of the interconnects under test. Response compaction techniques proposed in the schemes are such that fault detection and diagnosis can be done independent of the topological information about the interconnects. These response compaction techniques can be implemented within each boundary scan cell or outside the boundary scan chain, providing a trade-off in terms of test time and hardware complexity. The various uses of the boundary scan architecture make the proposed schemes more attractive and advantageous than the existing approaches for board interconnect testing. Moreover, a family of interconnect testing schemes is proposed for a partial boundary scan environment. Partial boundary scan environment refers to a board with a mix of boundary scan and non-boundary scan components. Such an environment is more complex compared to a complete boundary scan environment. The proposed schemes are BIST-able despite the inherently complex test environment. However, fault coverage is limited because of the reduced accessibility of the partial boundary scan environment...|$|R
