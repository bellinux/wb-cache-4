Studies of physiological response to aerobic activity, of muscle pathology and muscle function in CFS, are reviewed, and suggest that the subjective report of fatigue is not due to any peripheral impairment.

40|$|Background Habituation, {{a form of}} non-associative learning, {{has several}} {{well-defined}} characteristics that apply {{to a wide range}} of physiological and behavioral responses in many organisms. In classic patch time allocation models, habituation is considered to be a major mechanistic component of parasitoid behavioral strategies. However, parasitoid behavioral responses to host cues have not previously been tested for the known, specific characteristics of habituation. Methods In the laboratory, we tested whether the foraging behavior of the egg parasitoid Trissolcus basalis shows specific characteristics of habituation in response to consecutive encounters with patches of host (Nezara viridula) chemical contact cues (footprints), in particular: (i) a training interval-dependent decline in response intensity, and (ii) a training interval-dependent recovery of the response. Results As would be expected of a habituated response, wasps trained at higher frequencies decreased their behavioral response to host footprints more quickly and to a greater degree than those trained at low frequencies, and subsequently showed a more rapid, although partial, recovery of their behavioral response to host footprints. This putative habituation learning could not be blocked by cold anesthesia, ingestion of an ATPase inhibitor, or ingestion of a protein synthesis inhibitor. Discussion Our study provides support for the assumption that diminishing responses of parasitoids to chemical indicators of host presence constitutes habituation as opposed to <b>sensory</b> <b>fatigue,</b> and provides a preliminary basis for exploring the underlying mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{presentation}} of an olfactory stimulus causes a decrement of the chemotaxis response in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. However, {{the differences between the}} learning process of habituation (a readily reversible decrease in behavioral response) and other types of olfactory plasticity such as adaptation (a decrement in response due to <b>sensory</b> <b>fatigue,</b> which cannot be dishabituated) have not been addressed. The volatile odorant diacetyl (DA) was used within a single paradigm to assess the distinct processes of olfactory adaptation and habituation. Preexposing and testing worms to 100 % DA vapors caused a chemotaxis decrement that was not reversible despite the {{presentation of}} potentially dishabituating stimuli. This DA adaptation was abolished in worms with an odr- 10 mutation (encoding a high-affinity DA receptor on the AWA neuron), even though naive chemotaxis remained unaffected. Conversely, DA adaptation remained intact in odr- 1 mutants (defective in AWC neuron-mediated olfactory behavior), even though naive chemotaxis to DA decreased. Surprisingly, exposure to vapors of intermediate concentrations of DA (0. 01 % and 25 %) did not cause worms to exhibit any response decrement. In contrast to preexposure to high DA concentrations, preexposure to low DA concentrations (0. 001 %) produced habituation of the chemotaxis response (a dishabituating stimulus could reverse the response decrement back to baseline levels).

Following a comprehensive screening and physical exami-nation, cardiovascular endurance, pulmonary function, and fatigue were assessed leading {{to the development of}} 12 -week individualized exercise prescriptions and exercise interventions. The cancer survivors were divided into during treatment (DTm) and following treatment (FTm) groups. Repeated-measures analysis of variance and analy-ses of covariance were used to compare pre- versus postin-tervention and between groups. Cardiopulmonary function was maintained in the DTm, whereas the FTm showed sig-nificant reductions in resting heart rate (P <. 05) with con-current increases in predicted VO 2 max and time on treadmill (P <. 05) postexercise intervention. Fatigue levels did not increase in the DTm group, whereas the FTm group showed significant reductions in behavioral fatigue, affec-tive fatigue, <b>sensory</b> <b>fatigue,</b> cognitive/mood fatigue, and total fatigue (P <. 05) after the exercise intervention.

40|$|Design {{of sensory}} {{multi-session}} trials with preparation constraints Designs for sensory studies must satisfy several requirements. Usually a given number of products {{are to be}} evaluated {{and there is an}} upper limit to the number of assessors available. Due to variation in sensory perception, inter-assessor product comparisons are preferred. For large product numbers, trials are split into sessions to avoid <b>sensory</b> <b>fatigue</b> and the sequential presentation of products can cause order and carry-over effects. Thus, resolvable row-column or cross-over designs are required, which ensure that each assessor tastes all products the same number of times. In this thesis a three-step procedure is proposed to generate designs for trials where the number of products prepared for or served in each session is limited. First, an incomplete block design with a special column structure, the preparation design, is created, assigning products to sessions. Secondly, a cross-over design is constructed, assigning the columns of the preparation design to assessors. In the third step the two designs are combined by identifying the column-order of the preparation design that results in the highest average efficiency of the complete cross-over design. Search algorithms for incomplete block and cross-over designs are modified to produce preparation and panel designs with a special structure to guarantee resolvability of the complete sensory design. This procedure has been enhanced to produce designs for trials involving a control and several test products, in which control-test comparisons are estimated with higher precision than test-test comparisons. Two distinct construction methods have been developed for this case. By using factorial preparation designs the three step procedure can also be adapted for creating factorial multi-session designs with or without a control product...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project fully defines and evaluates {{a new approach}} in sensory omission testing, based on the same-different test (ASTM E 2139 - 05 2011) and the Thurstonian measure d′. The applications of this new approach were investigated to fully characterise sweet and savoury flavour models and to investigate interactions between flavour compounds. Panels of naïve assessors {{conducted a series of}} omission tests using both a strawberry (9 volatiles) and a savoury (10 volatiles) flavour model. Using the Thurstonian d′ as a measure of the sensitivity of the discrimination test, results showed that the new approach using the same-different test was more sensitive compared to the more traditional approach using the triangle test: the d′ values obtained using the same-different test were 1. 2 to 3. 5 times higher than the d′ values obtained using the triangle test. It was hypothesised that the evaluation of three samples in the triangle test generated additional noise related to carry-over, <b>sensory</b> <b>fatigue</b> and memory effects. In particular, the triangle test requires that the three successive stimulus sensations are stored into memory until the discrimination test has been completed. The same-different approach was then successfully applied to (i) determine the relative importance of individual volatiles in ortho- and retronasal flavours (ii) assess interactions between volatiles in mixtures, and (iii) investigate interactions between congruent tastes and aromas in flavours. Results showed that cis- 3 -hexen- 1 -ol, 4 -hydroxy- 2, 5 -dimethyl- 3 -furanone and ethyl butanoate {{play a key role in}} the strawberry flavour, while sulfur compounds play a major role in the savoury flavour. For both the sweet and the savoury flavours, orthonasal perception was more sensitive to the removal of individual volatiles and this was attributed to different efficiency in delivery to the olfactory receptors. The same-different approach highlighted synergistic, suppressive and blending interactions between volatiles within flavour mixtures. In particular, the presence of 4 -hydroxy- 2, 5 -dimethyl- 3 -furanone increased the assessor sensitivity to the removal of other individual volatiles in the savoury flavour. Cross-modal interactions were highlighted within the strawberry flavour, particularly where congruency between taste and aroma could be identified. The omission approach brings a novel contribution to sensory science as it allows further analyses and a deeper understanding of flavour. This study pioneers the use of the Thurstonian d′ for omission experiments, enabling the relative importance of the individual components of flavour perception to be determined...|$|E

Twice daily the diary additionally included 16 multi-answer questions covering physical symptoms (30 items), cognitive-affective functioning (25 items) and external factors (25 items). Eight clustered prodromal features were identified in the current study: <b>sensory</b> sensitivity, pain/stiffness, <b>fatigue,</b> cognitive functioning, positive affect, negative affect, effort spent and stressors encountered. Per feature, individual change scores with interictal control days- excluding 24 -hour post-attack recovery- were computed for six 12 -hour pre-attack time windows covering three prodromal days. Linear mixed model (fixed-effect) analysis established significant increases in sensory sensitivity, pain/stiffness and fatigue, and a tendency for increased negative affect, in the 12 hours prior to the attack.

40|$|Berry sensory {{assessment}} (BSA) is {{a technique}} that can help grapegrowers and winemakers make decisions about harvest date and grape product allocation. BSA as a structured technique {{has been used by}} grapegrowers, winemakers and researchers for the last thirteen years. However the number of studies reporting results of the effect of viticultural practices on berry sensory characteristics and wine quality is limited. This thesis examined the BSA technique through four different studies. Study one is a combined review literature review and industry survey paper in which the methodology of Berry Sensory Assessment is presented and the research conducted using BSA is discussed. It also presents the results of a survey channeled to Australian grapegrowers and Australian and New Zealand winemakers about their experience using BSA, their perceptions on its use and their suggestions for improving the methodology. It was evident from the survey that 90 % of grapegrowers and winemakers use BSA and they want to understand the link between BSA and wine quality. These results demonstrated the importance of BSA for wine producers and the need for further improvement. The aim of study number two was to determine if berry sensory attributes and berry compositional variables could predict wine sensory attributes, wine compositional variables and wine quality in Shiraz. The analyses of berry and wine sensory attributes, compositional measures and wine quality using partial least squares regression and Pearson’s correlations from two seasons identified several relationships between berry sensory attributes and wine sensory attributes and quality. A significant negative relationship was identified between seed bitterness and wine savoury spice flavour for the two seasons. The berry sensory attribute pulp detachment from the skin was identified as a predictor of various wine sensory attributes (eg. the harder to detach skin from the pulp the higher intensity for wine body colour, rim colour and dark berry aroma) and wine quality scores in the season 2011. The aim of study number three was to determine if berries stored at - 20 °C for three months could be used instead of fresh berries to conduct BSA. Being able to conduct BSA on frozen berries could help to reduce <b>sensory</b> <b>fatigue</b> in assessors by allowing them to evaluate samples over a longer time period and to schedule BSA away from the busy harvest period. The results of this study determined that sensory profile from Shiraz berries differed in five sensory attributes – pulp sweetness, pulp fresh fig flavour, skin colour extraction, skin bitterness and seed astringency - between fresh and frozen berries at three times of harvest, preventing the evaluation of these five sensory attributes in Shiraz frozen berries. Study number four aimed to determine the effect of three rootstocks on sensory and compositional differences of Shiraz grapes and wines in comparison to a nongrafted control. The trial was conducted over two seasons. Berry and wine sensory and compositional {{differences were found between the}} grafted treatments and the nongrafted control. PCA was able to discriminate the wines from the four treatments in three groups of aroma compounds (acetate esters, ethyl esters and higher alcohols) in both seasons. The results of wine quality scores from two seasons showed that the un-grafted treatment had the lowest quality and 110 Richter and Schwarzmann the highest. The findings from this study identified relationships between the sensory and compositional variables in berries and wines that are affecting wine quality. It also showed that that the use of rootstocks has an impact on berry and wine sensory and compositional characteristics. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Methods: Twenty-three patients with Her 2 -overexpressing breast cancer received in the first cycle paclitaxel and trastuzumab and from cycle 2 onwards lonafarnib which {{was added to the}} combination. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was determined during the second cycle. Results: The MTD and the recommended dose for phase II trials are lonafarnib: 250 mg/day [125 mg/bi-daily (BID) ] continuously, paclitaxel: 175 mg/mA 3 -h infusion every 3 weeks, and trastuzumab: 4 mg/kg loading dose and 2 mg/kg/week thereafter. The most frequently observed adverse events starting from cycle 1 onwards were alopecia, myalgia, <b>sensory</b> neuropathy, <b>fatigue,</b> arthralgia, leukocytopenia, and neutropenia. From cycle 2 onwards, additional adverse events appeared, such as diarrhea, nausea, dyspepsia, vomiting, and allergy. The mean systemic exposures of both lonafarnib and paclitaxel through all dose levels were higher in the regimen with all three study medications but with no statistically significant difference. Preliminary antitumor activity (CR + PR) was observed in 58 % of all patients.

Concurrently the mental health of patients was also examined. This observational study examined the impact of mental health on cognition in a cohort of early MS patients with little physical disability. The study confirmed that depression, anxiety and fatigue impact are strongly correlated with cognitive test scores of MS patients. This study has added another mental health parameter, stress.

Multidisciplinary vocational rehabilitation, exercise therapy, cognitive behavioural interventions, workplace interventions and empowerment are interventions with at least some evidence of effectiveness. Future policy could focus more on promotion of workers' health and future research should include the interests and motivations of employers concerning disability management, skills of line managers, the feasibility of interventions to prevent work disability and the context sensitivity of study outcome...|$|R
5000|$|... "Potentiation of habituation" [...] is {{observed}} when tests of spontaneous recovery are given repeatedly. In this phenomenon, {{the decrease in}} responding that follows spontaneous recovery becomes more rapid with each test of spontaneous recovery. Also noted was that {{an increase in the}} frequency of stimulus presentation (i.e., shorter interstimulus interval) will increase the rate of habituation. Furthermore, continued exposure to the stimulus after the habituated response has plateaued (i.e., show no further decrement) may have additional effects on subsequent tests of behavior such as delaying spontaneous recovery. The concepts of stimulus generalization and stimulus discrimination will be observed. Habituation to an original stimulus will also occur to other stimuli that are similar to the original stimulus (stimulus generalization). The more similar the new stimulus is to the original stimulus, the greater the habituation that will be observed. When a subject shows habituation to a new stimulus that is similar to the original stimulus but not to a stimulus that is different from the original stimulus, then the subject is showing stimulus discrimination. (For example, if one was habituated to the taste of lemon, their responding would increase significantly when presented with the taste of lime). Stimulus discrimination can be used to rule out <b>sensory</b> adaptation and <b>fatigue</b> as an alternative explanation of the habituation process.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study investigates a torque {{estimation}} method for muscle fatigue tracking, using stimulus evoked electromyography (eEMG) {{in the context}} of a functional electrical stimulation (FES) rehabilitation system. Although FES is able to effectively restore motor function in spinal cord injured (SCI) individuals, its application is inevitably restricted by muscle fatigue. In addition, the <b>sensory</b> feedback indicating <b>fatigue</b> is missing in such patients. Therefore, torque estimation is essential to provide feedback or feedforward signal for adaptive FES control. In this work, a fatigue-inducing protocol is conducted on five SCI subjects via transcutaneous electrodes under isometric condition, and eEMG signals are collected by surface electrodes. A myoelectrical mechanical muscle model based on the Hammerstein structure with eEMG as model input is employed to capture muscle contraction dynamics. It is demonstrated that the correlation between eEMG and torque is time-varying during muscle fatigue. Compared to conventional fixed-parameter models, the adaptedparameter model shows better torque prediction performance in fatiguing muscles. It motivates us to use a Kalman filter with forgetting factor for estimating the time-varying parameters and for tracking muscle fatigue. The assessment with experimental data reveals that the identified eEMG-to-torque model properly predicts fatiguing muscle behavior. Furthermore, the performance of the time-varying parameter estimation is efficient, suggesting that real-time tracking is feasible with a Kalman filter and driven by eEMG sensing in the application of FES...|$|R
40|$|During courtship, many animals, {{including}} insects, birds, fish, and mammals, utilize acoustic {{signals to}} transmit information about species identity. Although auditory communication is crucial across phyla, the neuronal and physiologic processes are poorly understood. Sound-evoked chaining behavior, {{a display of}} homosexual courtship behavior in Drosophila males, has long been used as an excellent model for analyzing auditory behavior responses, outcomes of acoustic perception and higher-order brain functions. Here we developed a new method, termed ChaIN (Chain Index Numerator), in which we use a computer-based auto detection system for chaining behavior. The ChaIN system can systematically detect the chaining behavior induced {{by a series of}} modified courtship song playbacks. Two evolutionarily related Drosophila species, Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans, exhibited dramatic selective increases in chaining behavior when exposed to specific auditory cues, suggesting that auditory discrimination processes are involved in the acceleration of chaining behavior. Prolonged monotonous pulse sounds containing courtship song components also induced high intense chaining behavior. Interestingly, the chaining behavior was gradually suppressed over time when song playback continued. This behavioral change {{is likely to be a}} plastic behavior and not a simple <b>sensory</b> adaptation or <b>fatigue,</b> because the suppression was released by applying a different pulse pattern. This behavioral plasticity is not a form of habituation because different modality stimuli did not recover the behavioral suppression. Intriguingly, this plastic behavior partiall...|$|R
40|$|Irrespective of the {{geometry}} and other factors, the human motor sensory system creates and processes signals {{in a manner}} that is qualitatively different from those produced by stiff mechanical testing machines. This is primarily because the tissues own deformability and rheological properties play a major role in the stimulus generation. Consequently, and unlike in man-made machines operating in their designed load range, the sensory sensitivity depends on both the rheological properties of the tissues involved and those of the specimen. Also, the sensory response to a mechanical stimulus is non linear and can be affected by adaptation and <b>fatigue.</b> <b>Sensory</b> evaluation and material science have different vocabularies and many sensory textural attributes are difficult to express in universal mechanical terms. It is, therefore, proposed to deepen the involvement of material science in texture studies and to relate the distribution of sensory responses to well defined and measurable mechanical properties like stiffness, toughness, elasticity and brittleness. Since textural differences are frequently accompanied by other organoleptic differences, hydrocolloids offer a unique way to create and control the mechanical properties of model and real foods with minimal effect on their flavor and color. Such foods, at least in principle, can reveal how mechanical properties are perceived. They can also help establish the human sensitivity to various mechanical properties thus helping the food industry not only to create and control desirable textural characteristics, but also to establish rational tolerance margins to the mechanical properties of its products...|$|R
