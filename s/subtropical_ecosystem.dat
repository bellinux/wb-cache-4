Over this time period, domestic fishing effort, as numbers of hooks set in the core Hawaii-based fishing ground, has increased fourfold. The standardized aggregated annual catch rate for 9 small (, 15 kg) species increased about 25 % while for 14 large species (. 15 kg) it decreased about 50 % over the 16 -year period. A size-based ecosystem model for the subtropical Pacific captures this pattern well {{as a response to}} increased fishing effort. Further, the model projects a decline in the abundance of fishes larger than 15 kg results in an increase in abundance of animals from 0. 1 to 15 kg but with minimal subsequent cascade to sizes smaller than 0. 1 kg.

In most southern inner zones, photic depth declined consistently throughout the 11 -year observation period; such long-term trend was not observed offshore nor in the northern regions. Averaged across the GBR, photic depths declined to 47 % of local maximum values soon after the onset of river floods, and recovery to 95 % of maximum values took on average 6 months (range: 150 – 260 days). The river effects were strongest at latitude 14. 5 °– 19. 0 °S, where river loads are high and the continental shelf is narrow. Here, even offshore zones showed a > 40 % seasonal decline in photic depth, and 17 – 24 % reductions in annual mean photic depth in years with large river nutrients and sediment loads.

40|$|Purpose Denitrification {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied in soils from temperate zones in industrialized countries. However, few studies quantifying denitrification rates in soils from tropical and subtropical zones have been reported. Denitrification mechanisms in tropical/subtropical soils may be different from other soils due to their unique soil characteristics. The identification of denitrification in the area is crucial to understand the role of denitrification in the global nitrogen (N) cycle in terrestrial ecosystems and in the interaction between global environmental changes and ecosystem responses. Materials and methods We review the existing literature on microbially mediated denitrification in tropical/subtropical soils, attempting to provide a better understanding about and new research directions for denitrification in these regions. Results and discussion Tropical and subtropical soils might be characterized by generally lower denitrification capacity than temperate soils, with greater variability due to land use and management practices varying temporally and spatially. Factors that influence soil water content and the nature and rate of carbon (C) and N turnover are the landscape-scale and field-scale controls of denitrification. High redox potential in the field, which is mainly attributed to soil oxide enrichment, may be at least one critical edaphic variable responsible for slow denitrification rates in the humid tropical and subtropical soils. However, soil pH is not responsible for these slow denitrification rates. Organic C mineralization {{is more important than}} total N content and C/N in determining denitrification capacity in humid subtropical soils. There is increasing evidence that the ecological consequence of denitrification in tropical and subtropical soils may be different from that of temperate zones. Contribution of denitrification in tropical and subtropical regions to the global climate warming should be considered comprehensively since it could affect other greenhouse gases, such as methane (CH 4) and carbon dioxide (CO 2), and N deposition. Conclusions Tropical/subtropical soils have developed several N conservation strategies to prevent N losses via denitrification from the ecosystems. However, the mechanisms involved in the biogeochemical regulation of tropical and <b>subtropical</b> <b>ecosystem</b> responses to environmental changes are largely unknown. These works are important for accurately modeling denitrification and all other simultaneously operating N transformations. Griffith Sciences, School of Natural SciencesNo Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (PhD(For)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. The <b>subtropical</b> <b>ecosystem</b> of the Zululand {{coastal plain}} is prized by the South African {{commercial}} plantation forestry industry for its rapid clonal Eucalyptus growth, short rotations (6 to 7 years) and high yields. This region is typified by sandy soils that {{are low in}} clay and organic matter, have small nutrient reserves and are poorly buffered against nutrient loss. The subtropical climate induces rapid decomposition of residues and tree litter resulting in small litter nutrient pools and rapid nutrient release into the soil, particularly after clearfelling. A combination of large nutrient demands through rapid growth, rapid nutrient turnover and small soil nutrient reserves implies that sites in this region are sensitive and {{may be at risk}} of nutrient decline under intensive management. The work in this study set out to determine the risk of nutrient depletion through harvesting and residue management on a site within the Zululand region, to assess nutritional sustainability and the risk of yield decline in successive rotations. Some bulk biogeochemical cycling processes of macro-nutrients nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) were assessed, and assessments also included sodium (Na). An existing Eucalyptus stand was clearfelled and treatments were imposed on the residues after broadcasting to simulate various levels of nutrient loss through levels of harvesting intensity and residue management. These included residue burning (Burn), residue retention (No-Burn), fertilisation (stem wood nutrient replacement), whole tree harvesting and residue doubling. Outer blocks of the stand were not felled, but included as replicates of an undisturbed standing crop treatment. Biogeochemical nutrient cycling processes were assessed primarily in the standing crop, Burn and No-Burn treatments, in the assumption that these represented the furthest extremes of nutrient loss. Data collection commenced a year prior to clearfelling and continued to two years and six months after planting with key data collection over a 20. 1 month period from clearfelling to canopy closure (one year after planting). Water related nutrient pools and fluxes were assessed as atmospheric deposition (bulk rainfall, throughfall and stemflow) and gravitational leaching to 1 m soil depth. Drainage fluxes were predicted using the Hydrus model and real-time soil moisture data. Zero tension lysimeters collected soil solution for chemical analysis. Sequential coring in the 0 to 30 cm soil layer was used to determine in situ soil N mineralisation. Soil chemical and physical properties were assessed over the first meter of soil at clearfelling and new crop canopy closure to determine soil nutrient pools sizes. Biomass nutrient fluxes were assessed from litterfall, residue and litter decomposition, and above ground accretion into the tree biomass. Leaching and N mineralisation were monitored in the No-Burn, Burn and standing crop treatments only. Atmospheric deposition, while variable, was shown to be responsible for large quantities of nutrients added to the Eucalyptus stand. Nitrogen and K additions were relatively high, but within ranges reported in previous studies. Rapid tree canopy expansion and subsequent soil water utilisation in the standing crop permitted little water to drain beyond 1 m resulting in small leaching losses despite a sandy well drained soil. Further leaching beyond this depth was unlikely under the conditions during the study period. Mineralisation and immobilisation of N also remained low with net immobilisation occurring. The standing crop was shown to be a relatively stable system that, outside of extreme climatic events, had a relatively balanced or positive nutrient budget (i. e. nutrient inputs minus outputs). Large quantities of nutrients were removed with stem-wood-only harvesting in the No-Burn treatment leaving substantial amounts on the soil surface in the harvest residues. Whole tree removal increased losses of all nutrients resulting in the largest losses of P and base cations compared to all other treatments. This was mostly due to high nutrient concentrations in the removed bark. Loss of N in the Burn treatment exceeded whole tree N losses through combustion of N held in the harvest residues and litter layer. The majority of K leached from the residues prior to burning and a relatively small fraction of the base cations were lost from the partially decomposed residues during burning. Ash containing substantial amounts of Ca and relatively large amounts of N and Mg remained after burning. Surface soil Ca and Mg was significantly increased by the ash which moved into the soil with rainfall directly after burning. Rapid soil moisture recharge occurred within a few months after clearfelling, increasing leaching from the upper 50 cm of soil. Clearfelling increased net N mineralisation rates, increasing mobile NO 3 -N ions in the soil surface layers. Nitrate concentration peaked and K concentration dipped in the upper soil layers of the Burn treatment directly after burning. Deep drainage and leaching (beyond 1 m depth) over the 20. 1 month period was, however, not significantly different between the Burn and No-Burn treatments. Rapid soil moisture depletion and nutrient uptake with new crop growth reduced leaching fluxes to levels similar to the standing crop by six months after planting. Taking the full rotation into account, clearfelling induced a short-lived spike in N and cation leaching compared with the low leaching losses in the undisturbed standing crop. Soil N mineralisation over the 20. 1 month period in the burnt treatment was half that of the No-Burn treatment. Growth and nutrient accumulation was significantly higher in the fertilised treatment than in other treatments up to 2. 5 years of age. Growth in the Burn treatment was greatest compared to other treatments during the first few months, but slowed thereafter. No significant growth differences were found between all other treatments from a year to 2. 5 years after planting. Early growth was therefore apparently not limited by N supply despite large differences in N mineralisation between Burn and No-Burn. Foliar vector analysis indicated that fertilisation improved growth initially through increased foliar N and P at six months after planting followed by Mg and Ca at one year. The Burn treatment was not nutrient limited. These growth results contrasted with similar international research on sandy tropical sites where growth was reduced after residue removal and increased after residue doubling. The combined nutrients released from pools in the litter layer or ash and soil in addition to atmospheric inputs were sufficient to provide most nutrients required to maintain similar growth rates across all treatments. This demonstrated the importance of residue derived nutrients to early growth nutrient supply. Reduced N mineralisation through a lack of substrate may limit N supply later in the rotation where residue had been removed. Construction of a nutrient budget for the system revealed that high levels of atmospheric inputs have the potential to partially replenish a large proportion N, K, and Ca lost during clearfelling, provided losses are constrained to stemwood removal only. However, loss of Mg that occurred primarily through leaching may not be replaced under the low Mg inputs recorded in this study. Larger nutrient removals (i. e. stemwood plus other plant parts) placed a heavier reliance on the small soil nutrient pools at this site which can limit future productivity. More intense harvesting and residue management practices dramatically increased the risk of nutrient depletion. Losses of specific nutrients depended on a combination of clearfelling biomass removal, residue burning and subsequent leaching. Nitrogen losses due to harvesting and burning were more substantial than those due to leaching. Mg and K losses depended most strongly on the time after clearfelling before re-establishment of the new crop and rainfall patterns, while Ca and P losses depended directly on the amount of biomass removed. Depletion risk was the greatest for Mg and K through rapid leaching, even after stem wood only removal. Deep root uptake and deep drainage with associated cation loss needs to be investigated further to quantify ecosystem losses and recovery of cations displaced beyond 1 m. Atmospheric deposition is one of major factors countering nutrient losses. However, atmospheric inputs may not be reliable as these may lessen in future through pollution control legislation and climate change. Changes in growth rate under poor nutrient management practices are small and difficult to detect relative to the large impacts of changing weather patterns (drought), wildfire and pest and disease. This makes it difficult to prove nutrient related growth decline. It may be possible that improvements in genetics, silvicultural technologies and atmospheric inputs may also be masking site decline (in general) and in part explain the lack of evidence of a growth reduction in the region. As the poorly buffered sandy soils on the Zululand Coast are at risk of nutrient depletion under the short rotation, high productivity stands, {{it may be necessary to}} stipulate more conservative harvesting and residue management practices. A more conservative stem-wood only harvesting regime is recommended, retaining all residues on site. Residue burning should be avoided if N losses become a concern. The length of the inter-rotation period must be kept short to reduce cation leaching losses. Site nutrient pools need to be monitored and cations may eventually need to be replenished through application of fertilisers or ash residues from pulp mills. Management practices therefore need to be chosen based on the specific high risk nutrients in order to maintain a sustainable nutrient supply to current and future plantation grown Eucalyptus...|$|E

Among these fractions, the highest activities of phenol oxidase (PHO), β-D-glucosidase (GLU), and N-acetyl-glucosiminidase (NAG) were found in sand, and greater than bulk sediments of both intertidal zone (IZ) and mangrove forest (MG). This result implied that sand fractions might protect selective enzymes through the adsorption without affecting their activities. Additionally, the enzyme-based resource allocation in various particle-size fractions demonstrated that nutrients availability varied with different particle-size fractions and only sand fraction of MG with highest total C showed high N and P availability among fractions. Besides, the analysis between elemental contents and enzyme activities in particle size fractions suggested that enzymes could monitor the changes of nutrients availability and be good indicators of ecosystem responses to environmental changes.

There has been limited study of viral abundance and ecological role in sediments, or along estuarine gradients in coastal marine ecosystems. Hence, viral dynamics were investigated in both water column and sediments along estuarine gradients in two <b>subtropical</b> <b>ecosystems</b> in Queensland, Australia; a eutrophic estuary (Brisbane River / Moreton Bay; 27 o S, 153 o E) and an oligotrophic estuary (Noosa River; 26 oS, 153 oE). Virus, bacteria and microalgae from water and sediment samples were enumerated following filtration through a 0. 02 mm Al 2 O 3 filter using a SYBR Green I staining technique. Benthic viral abundance ranged from 107 – 109 particles mL- 1, bacterial abundance ranged from 107 – 108 cells mL- 1, and microalgal abundance ranged from 104 – 105 cells mL- 1. Water column abundances for all microorganisms were 10 – 1000 fold lower than sediment abundances. Benthic virus abundance correlated strongly to water column virus abundance (r 2 = 0. 80), total suspended solids (r 2 = 0. 73) and virus/bacteria rati...|$|R
25|$|Due to the adaptational {{requirements}} of the independently acquired long-distance migrant lifestyle, several apparent morphological similarities between supposedly related species are actually due to convergent evolution. The genus colonized Central America shortly after the final formation of the Panamanian Isthmus. Subsequently, in tropical or <b>subtropical</b> forest <b>ecosystems</b> of northern Central America, species diverged to settle more northerly regions, subsequently finding themselves forced to migrate south in winter into more food-rich habitat. The most ancient of these northward divergences was probably Swainson's thrush, {{and the most recent}} one the fuscescens-minimus-bicknelli cryptic species complex.|$|R
40|$|The {{tropical}} and subtropical Western Pacific Ocean region possesses {{an enormous}} marine biodiversity, but suffers impacts {{from a combination}} of high population density and a rapid economic development, a major result of which is high material inputs from land-based sources (i. e. rivers). Furthermore, this region is exposed to frequent climatic and oceanic perturbations, e. g., monsoons with episodic typhoons of ca. 10 events per year. The tropical and <b>subtropical</b> marine <b>ecosystems</b> of the Western Pacific Ocean are therefore particularly vulnerable to the combined effects of land-based human activities and ocean-/atmosphere-based climate events...|$|R
40|$|Iron (Fe) {{biogeochemistry}} {{is potentially}} of environmental significance in plantation-forested, <b>subtropical</b> coastal <b>ecosystems</b> where soil disturbance and seasonal water logging {{may lead to}} elevation of Fe mobilization and associated water quality deterioration. Using wet-chemical extraction and laboratory cultivation, we examined the occurrence of Fe forms and associated bacterial populations in diverse soils of a representative subtropical Australian coastal catchment (Poona Creek). Total reactive Fe was abundant throughout 0 e 30 cm soil cores, consisting primarily of crystalline forms in well-drained sand soils and water-logged loam soils, whereas in water-logged, low clay soils, over half of total reactive Fe was present in poorly-crystalline forms due to organic and inorganic complexation, respectively. Forestry practices such as plantation clear-felling and replanting, seasonal water logging and mineral soil properties significantly impacted soil organic carbon (C), potentially-bioavailable Fe pools and densities of S-, but not Fe-, bacterial populations. Bacterial Fe(III) reduction and abiotic Fe(II) oxidation, as well as chemolithotrophic S oxidation and aerobic, heterotrophic respiration were integral to catchment terrestrial FeeC cycling. This work demonstrates bacterial involvement in terrestrial Fe cycling in a <b>subtropical</b> coastal circumneutral-pH <b>ecosystem...</b>|$|R
40|$|Mudskippers are {{important}} in many biological and ecotoxicological studies and recognized as potentioal Biomarker in environmental monitoring and assessments of coastal waters in tropical and <b>subtropical</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> DNA Barcoding technique was used to identify the exact species of mudskippers in the Persian Gulf from Coastal waters of Bushehr province. This technique may provide faster detecting and giving {{a lot of information}} about the taxonomy of species. Samples were collected from four areas including Genaveh, Shif, Delawar and Mond in Bushehr province. According to morphological properties three species (Boleophthalmus dussumeri, Periophthalmus waltoni and Scartelaos teneus) were identified. In order to barcoding, mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase of the fish was sequenced. COI sequence analysis of ten specimens from each species indicates that B. dussumeri, P. waltoni and S. teneus have genetic differences in amount of 17. 8 %. Maximum genetic differences were calculated between B. dussumeri, P. waltoni (19. 1 %) and minimum genetic differences were observed between P. waltoni and S. teneus (11. 8 %). These amounts of genetic differences among the studied mudskippers, approve the presence of three species in Bushehr coastal waters. COI sequence comparison and phylogenetic tree of each studied species with other mudskippers clustered these species in the same genus. In molecular obtained data confirmed the present morphological classification methods for these species...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{significance}} of interannual variation of soil respiration (R(S)) for understanding long-term soil carbon dynamics, factors that control the interannual variation of R(S) have not been sufficiently investigated. Interannual variation of R(S) was studied using a 6 -year data set collected in a subtropical plantation dominated by an exotic species, slash pine (Pinus elliottii Engelm.), in China. The results showed that seasonal variation of R(S) was significantly affected by soil temperature and soil water content (SWC). R(S) in the dry season (July October) was constrained by seasonal drought. Mean annual R(S) {{was estimated to be}} 736 +/- 30 g C. m(- 2). year(- 1), with a range of 706 - 790 g C. m(- 2). year(- 1). Although this forest was characterized by a humid climate with high precipitation (1469 mm. year(- 1)), the interannual variation of R(S) was attributed to the changes of annual mean SWC (R(2) = 0. 66, P = 0. 03), which was affected by annual rainfall frequency (R(2) = 0. 80, P < 0. 01) and not rainfall amount (P = 0. 84). Consequently, precipitation pattern indirectly controlled the interannual variation of R(S) by affecting soil moisture in this subtropical forest. In the context of climate change, interannual variation of R(S) in <b>subtropical</b> <b>ecosystems</b> is expected to increase because of the predicted changes of precipitation regime...|$|R
40|$|Understanding species {{responses}} to global change will help predict shifts in species distributions {{as well as}} aid in conservation. Changes in the timing of seasonal activities of organisms over time {{may be the most}} responsive and easily observable indicator of environmental changes associated with global climate change. It is unknown how global climate change will affect species distributions and developmental events in <b>subtropical</b> <b>ecosystems</b> or if climate change will differentially favor nonnative species. Contrary to previously observed trends for earlier flowering onset of plant species with increasing spring temperatures from mid and higher latitudes, we document a trend for delayed seasonal flowering among plants in Florida. Additionally, there were few differences in reproductive responses by native and nonnative species to climatic changes. We argue that plants in Florida have different reproductive cues than those from more northern climates. With global change, minimum temperatures have become more variable within the temperate-subtropical zone that occurs across the peninsula and this variation is strongly associated with delayed flowering among Florida plants. Our data suggest that climate change varies by region and season and is not a simple case of species responding to consistently increasing temperatures across the region. Research on climate change impacts need to be extended outside of the heavily studied higher latitudes to include subtropical and tropical systems in order to properly understand the complexity o...|$|R
40|$|The Argentine ant is {{an exotic}} {{invasive}} species {{present in all}} the Mediterranean and <b>subtropical</b> <b>ecosystems</b> of the world. It is closely associated to urban and human-disturbed areas, even though it can also invade natural areas causing a strong negative effect in the biodiversity of the invaded area. In Menorca, the fist record of its presence was in 1976. In 2004 it was detected {{for the first time}} invading a natural area in the island, the s’Albufera des Grau Natural Park. The aim of this work is to determine both the distribution and degree of invasion of this species into the Park. To that effect, we sampled a total of 97 plots of 1 ha at 8 different areas across the Park. Of these, only 15 resulted invaded by the Argentine ant with different degrees of invasion. Additionally, we also detected 4 forefronts of invasion. Both the presence and degree of invasion into the s’Albufera des Grau Natural Park seems to be related to four factors: 1) degree of canopy cover, 2) proximity to urban or certain urban development areas, 3) degree of anthropic frequentness and 4) proximity to humid areas. The results obtained in this study allow getting basic information to elaborate further research about the real effects of the invasion in the biodiversity of the are...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{widespread}} interest in biofuel crops {{as a solution}} to the world's energy needs, particularly in light of concerns over greenhouse-gas emissions. Despite reservations about their adverse environmental impacts, no attempt has been made to quantify actual, relative or potential invasiveness of terrestrial biofuel crops at an appropriate regional or international scale, and their planting continues to be largely unregulated. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a widely accepted weed risk assessment system, we analyzed a comprehensive list of regionally suitable biofuel crops to show that seventy percent have a high risk of becoming invasive versus one-quarter of non-biofuel plant species and are two to four times more likely to establish wild populations locally or be invasive in Hawaii or in other locations with a similar climate. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Because of climatic and ecological similarities, predictions of biofuel crop invasiveness in Hawaii are applicable to other vulnerable island and <b>subtropical</b> <b>ecosystems</b> worldwide. We demonstrate the utility of an accessible and scientifically proven risk assessment protocol that allows users to predict if introduced species will become invasive in their region of interest. Other evidence supports the contention that propagule pressure created by extensive plantings will exacerbate invasions, a scenario expected with large-scale biofuel crop cultivation. Proactive measures, such as risk assessments, should be employed to predict invasion risks, which could then be mitigated via implementation of appropriate planting policies and adoption of the "polluter-pays" principle...|$|R
