5|$|Her {{journeys}} {{into the}} land of slavery put her at tremendous risk, and she {{used a variety of}} subterfuges to avoid detection. Tubman once disguised herself with a bonnet and carried two live chickens to give the appearance of running errands. Suddenly finding herself walking toward a former owner in Dorchester County, she yanked the strings holding the birds' legs, and their agitation allowed her to avoid eye contact. Later <b>she</b> <b>recognized</b> a fellow train passenger as another former master; she snatched a nearby newspaper and pretended to read. Since Tubman was known to be illiterate, the man ignored her.|$|E
5|$|Terrified of Santa Anna's {{retribution}} if {{he discovers}} {{that he is}} being paid with his own gold, Montero, at Love's urging, decides to destroy the mine and kill the workers. De La Vega tells Alejandro to release the workers on his own so that De La Vega can reclaim Elena. Alejandro sets off, feeling betrayed by Diego's vendetta. De La Vega corners Montero at the hacienda and reveals his identity, but Montero captures him by threatening Elena. As he is taken away, De La Vega tells Elena {{the name of the}} flowers <b>she</b> <b>recognized</b> upon her arrival in California, convincing her that he is her father. She releases De La Vega from his cell and they proceed to the mine, where Alejandro and De La Vega respectively defeat and slay Love and Montero. Elena and Alejandro free the workers before the explosives go off, and then find the mortally wounded De La Vega. He makes peace with Alejandro before dying, passing the mantle of Zorro to him, and gives his blessings for his marriage to Elena. In a closing sequence they are shown to be living together after rebuilding the De La Vega family señorío with a son named Joaquín, in honor of Alejandro's brother.|$|E

25|$|Gimbutas's {{theories}} have been extended and embraced {{by a number}} of neopaganism authors. Gimbutas did identify the diverse and complex Paleolithic and Neolithic female representations <b>she</b> <b>recognized</b> as depicting a single universal Great Goddess, but also as manifesting a range of female deities: snake goddess, bee goddess, bird goddess, mountain goddess, Mistress of the Animals, etc., which were not necessarily ubiquitous throughout Europe.|$|E

25|$|In 1946, Jones married fashion czar Harry Conover, one of {{the first}} model agents. They had three sons, and Jones says she didn't realize Conover was {{bisexual}} until some years into their marriage. <b>She</b> <b>recognized</b> some people might consider this naive, but Jones insisted her abusive childhood had made her wary of intimate relationships, and though she had many suitors, she was rather sexually inexperienced when she married. She reported that Conover initiated sexual activities with her very few times, and only when he was intoxicated.|$|E
25|$|After the English {{translation}} of Jung's book Psychological Types {{was published in}} 1923 (first published in German in 1921), <b>she</b> <b>recognized</b> that Jung's theory was similar to, but went far beyond, her own. Briggs's four types were later identified as corresponding to the IXXXs, EXXPs, EXTJs and EXFJs. Her first publications were two articles describing Jung's theory, in the journal New Republic in 1926 ("Meet Yourself Using the Personality Paint Box") and 1928 ("Up From Barbarism"). After extensively studying the work of Jung, they turned their interest in human behavior into efforts to turn the theory of psychological types to practical use.|$|E

The Government presented as evidence against her various letters which included five letters from Rojas, two issues of the newspaper El Observador Caraqueño; two copies of the newspaper El Cometa, and one copy each of the newspapers El Constitucional Caraqueño and El Colombiano, which were sympathetic to Bolívar’s ideals.

25|$|Early in {{her career}} <b>she</b> <b>recognized</b> that {{negative}} symptoms and associated cognitive impairments had more debilitating effects than psychotic symptoms, like delusions and hallucinations. While psychotic symptoms represent an exaggeration of normal brain/mind functions, negative symptoms represent a loss of normal functions, for example, alogia {{the loss of the}} ability to think and speak fluently, affective blunting the loss of the ability to express emotions, avolition, loss of the ability to initiate goal-directed activity, and anhedonia, loss of the ability to experience emotions. The papers describing these concepts have become citation classics, as determined by the Science Citation Index produced by the Institute for Scientific Information.|$|E
25|$|Maressa Orzack {{became aware}} of the concept of {{computer}} addiction when trying {{to learn how to use}} a new item of software. Frustrated with her progress, she started playing a common computer version of the card game solitaire. After a time she started using the computer more for playing the card game than actual work. From her previous experience, <b>she</b> <b>recognized</b> that she was demonstrating addictive behaviors. Orzack listed several symptoms of computer addiction, including using the computer for pleasure and relief from stress, feeling out of control and depressed when not using it, neglecting real life responsibilities and failure in attempts to cut down usage.|$|E
25|$|In a flashback, it was {{revealed}} that Scarlett was one of the original members of the Joe team, and one of her first assignments was training the new team in hand-to-hand combat. During one such exercise, Scarlett met Snake Eyes for the first time. While she bested most of the team's members, <b>she</b> <b>recognized</b> that Snake Eyes was a superior fighter, yet had allowed Scarlett to beat him. This had Scarlett intrigued, and they became close rather quickly. Later on a mission into the middle east, Snake Eyes, Scarlett, Rock 'n Roll, and Grunt were sent to save George Strawhacker from Cobra. On the way, a helicopter accident forced the Joes to bail out, but Scarlett was stuck in the burning chopper. Snake Eyes stayed behind to save her. He rescued Scarlett, but a window exploded in his face, scarring him and damaging his vocal cords. Despite his injuries, Snake Eyes convinced Hawk to let him continue with the mission.|$|E

25|$|The power {{position}} of queen Louisa Ulrika deteriorated with the declining health of her spouse, king Adolf Frederick, {{and the growing}} adulthood of her son, crown prince Gustav. <b>She</b> <b>recognized</b> this threat, and when her son was declared an adult in 1762, she unsuccessfully opposed him taking {{a seat in the}} royal council. The tense relationship between her and her son, whom she viewed as a political rival, grew when he opposed her will by insisting to honor the engagement to Sophia Magdalena of Denmark, whom he finally married in 1766, instead of marrying a Prussian bride selected by her, which he viewed as a way for her to keep her influence over him and the family. This was illustrated by the queens harassment of the crown princess when she arrived in Sweden. After the Riksdag of 1766, it was no longer her, but her son the crown prince, who became the leader of the followers of absolute monarchy. In 1767, when the French ambassador sketched a suggestion of a Swedish coup d'état, it was, for the first time, the crown prince rather than the queen who was regarded as the natural center figure of the coup.|$|E
25|$|Utah held {{intensely}} liberal {{views of}} women's suffrage {{and also a}} strong dedication to polygamy. To {{the people in the}} East, women's suffrage was seen as the opposite of polygamy. For many, the two ideals could not coincide because polygamy was seen as oppressive to women. Hamilton Wilcox, a New York suffragist (1867–1868), suggested women's suffrage should be experimented with in the territories. The East was heavily motivated to push women's enfranchisement in the Utah territory believing it would put an end to polygamy. By 1870 the idea became so popular and pushed by the East that Utah territorial legislature began debate over the right of women to vote. On February 12, 1870, after two weeks of debate a unanimous vote passed a bill enfranchising the women of Utah, fifty years before the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution guaranteed women nationwide the right to vote. However, instead of voting against plural marriage, Mormon women helped double the majority in favor of plural marriage by reelecting William H. Hooper, who defended polygamy. Froiseth, a long time believer in the enfranchisement of women and later {{the vice president of the}} Utah Women's Suffrage Association (1888), firmly believed Mormon women should not have the right to vote—at least until polygamy was outlawed. <b>She</b> <b>recognized</b> this was inconsistent with her beliefs about women's rights but concluded, by her own judgement, that Mormon women were too heavily influenced to make voting decisions for themselves.|$|E
500|$|According to Boyd, Harrison's {{mother was}} {{particularly}} supportive: [...] "All she wanted {{for her children}} is {{that they should be}} happy, and <b>she</b> <b>recognized</b> that nothing made George quite as happy as making music." [...] An enthusiastic music fan, she was known among friends for her loud singing voice, which at times startled visitors by rattling the Harrisons' windows. While pregnant with George, she often listened to the weekly broadcast Radio India. Harrison's biographer Joshua Greene wrote, [...] "Every Sunday she tuned in to mystical sounds evoked by sitars and tablas, hoping that the exotic music would bring peace and calm to the baby in the womb." ...|$|E

500|$|Thurman {{continued}} her writing work in Boston. In 1958, she published The Historical Cookbook of the American Negro, {{which not only}} gave recipes but included black history. It retold stories of professional women and history to counter the belief that all black women were maids and domestics {{at a time when}} African Americans were excluded from basic civil rights. <b>She</b> <b>recognized</b> that in order to tell their history, a new approach was needed as there was no market for histories of the African Americans. In the preface to her book, she explained she was creating [...] "palatable history", testifying to her shrewd marketing ability.|$|E
500|$|The 2011 Egyptian protests {{posed the}} most {{challenging}} foreign policy crisis for the administration yet. Clinton's public response quickly evolved from an early assessment {{that the government of}} Hosni Mubarak was [...] "stable", to a stance that there needed to be an [...] "orderly transition [...] a democratic participatory government", to a condemnation of violence against the protesters. Obama came to rely upon Clinton's advice, organization and personal connections in the behind-the-scenes response to developments. As Arab Spring protests spread throughout the region, Clinton was at the forefront of a U.S. response that <b>she</b> <b>recognized</b> was sometimes contradictory, backing some regimes while supporting protesters against others.|$|E
500|$|Lucy granddaughter, a Boston-area nurse named Susan Lawlor, {{became a}} fan of MOBA after seeing the {{portrait}} in a newspaper. <b>She</b> <b>recognized</b> it as her grandmother, Anna Lally Keane (c. 1890–1968); upon seeing the picture, Lawlor snorted Coca-Cola from her nose in astonishment. The painting was commissioned by her mother, and it hung in her aunt's house for many years, despite the trepidation family members felt at seeing the final composition. Says Lawlor: [...] "The face is hauntingly hers, but everything else is so horribly wrong. It looks like she only has one breast.
