5|$|Difficulties {{with the}} {{diffusers}} and pumps paled into insignificance besides {{those with the}} porous barrier. In order to work, the gaseous diffusion process required a barrier with microscopic holes, but not subject to plugging. It had to be extremely porous, but strong enough to handle the high pressures. And, like everything else, it had to resist corrosion from uranium hexafluoride. The latter criterion suggested a nickel barrier. Foster C. Nix at the Bell Telephone Laboratories experimented with nickel powder, while Edward O. Norris at the C. O. Jelliff Manufacturing Corporation and Edward Adler at the City College of New York worked on a design with electroplated metallic nickel. Norris was an English interior decorator, who had developed a very fine metal mesh for use with a <b>spray</b> <b>gun.</b> Their design appeared too brittle and fragile for the proposed use, particularly on the higher stages of enrichment, but there was hope {{that this could be}} overcome.|$|E

25|$|Surprisingly few artists {{used the}} <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> {{technique}} to create large expanses and fields of color sprayed across their canvases during the 1960s and 1970s. Some painters who effectively used spray painting techniques include Jules Olitski, {{who was a}} pioneer in his spray technique that covered his large paintings with layer after layer of different colors, often gradually changing hue and value in subtle progression. Another important innovation was Dan Christensen's use of a spray technique to great effect in loops and ribbons of bright color; sprayed in clear, calligraphic marks across his large-scale paintings. William Pettet, Richard Saba, and Albert Stadler, used the technique to create large-scale fields of multi-colors; while Kenneth Showell sprayed over crumpled canvases and created an illusion of abstract still-life interiors. Most of the spray painters were active especially during the late 1960s and 1970s.|$|E

500|$|Arts, which Playford {{showed no}} {{personal}} interest in, and regarded as [...] "frills not fundamentals" [...] and [...] "non-productive", became a more prominent issue among the emerging middle-class. For his attitude, Playford was often mocked by his opponents and critics for his [...] "philistinism". The Nation derisorily quipped that [...] "It is axiomatic that the Premier draws his orchard <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> {{at the mention}} of the word 'culture'". Sir Arthur Rymill, an LCL member of the upper house, criticised the demolition of the Theatre Royal, lobbied Playford for increased funding without success, pointing out that world-class performing arts venues were generally subsidised by the government. Hurtle Morphett, a former State President of the LCL, quipped that if Playford [...] "had wanted to convert the Art Gallery on North Terrace into a power house he would have done it without hesitation". In the 1960s, the Adelaide Festival started, while the Australian Dance Theatre and the State Theatre Company of South Australia was founded in the capital, with minimal assistance from Playford's government. The festival was well-received despite the effect of censorship in a state well known for social conservatism. With the success of the festival, public interest in arts increased, and with increasing calls for government funding, particularly from Dunstan, Playford finally agreed to fund the [...] "non-productive area" [...] in 1963 by allocating funding for the eventual building of the Festival Centre.|$|E

50|$|High volume low {{pressure}} (HVLP) {{is similar to}} a conventional <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> using a compressor to supply the air, but the <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> itself requires a lower pressure (LP). A higher volume (HV) of air is used to aerosolise and propel the paint at lower air pressure. The result is a higher proportion of paint reaching the target surface with reduced overspray, materials consumption, and air pollution.A regulator is often required so that the air pressure from a conventional compressor can be lowered for the HVLP <b>spray</b> <b>gun.</b> Alternatively a turbine unit (commonly containing a vacuum cleaner derived motor) can be used to propel the air without the need for an air line running to the compressor.|$|E

2500|$|Some airbrushes use {{pressures}} {{as low as}} 20 psi (1.38 bar) {{while others}} use pressures {{in the region of}} 30-35 psi (2-2.4 bar). Larger [...] "spray guns" [...] as used for automobile spray-painting need 100 psi (6.8 bar) or more to adequately atomize a thicker paint using less solvent. They are capable of delivering a heavier coating more rapidly over a wide area. Even with small artist airbrushes using acrylic paint, artists must be careful not to breathe in the atomized paint, which floats in the air for minutes and can go deep into the lungs. With commercial <b>spray</b> <b>guns</b> for automobiles, it is vital that the painter have a clean air source to breathe, because automotive paint is far more harmful to the lungs than acrylic. Certain <b>spray</b> <b>guns,</b> called High-Volume Low-Pressure (HVLP) <b>spray</b> <b>guns,</b> are designed to deliver the same high volumes of paint without requiring such high pressures.|$|R

50|$|Upon departing the <b>spray</b> <b>gun,</b> the {{graphene}} flake’s {{tendency to}} aggregate is reduced {{due to its}} quick evaporation and dispersion. Much to the researchers’ surprise, this spray method produces flakes that contain substantially less defects that would commonly occur. Common graphene defects including holes and lumps in the layer, and the Stone-Wales defect were absent upon surface impact. The large amount of kinetic energy delivered by the supersonic nozzle creates the healing of these defects, as the graphene flakes stretches upon impact. The carbon atoms within the graphene rearrange to create seamlessly perfect hexagonal lattice structures. The result of these perfect hexagon structures {{is the creation of}} a smooth, even layer of graphene. This is a large contrast to the applications of graphene onto large-scale substrates prior {{to the creation of the}} graphene <b>spray</b> <b>gun.</b> The graphene layers would commonly contain defecting clumps and spaces, which troubled scientists ever since the discovery of graphene. The graphene <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> is also regarded as inexpensive when compared to the other methods of large-scale graphene applications. One main factor for its inexpensiveness is that the graphene layers require no post-processing treatment, which was common in the other methods. The other factor is that the <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> is remarkably simple in both its production and utilization.|$|E

50|$|Spray {{painting}} is a painting technique where a device sprays a coating (paint, ink, varnish, etc.) {{through the air}} onto a surface. The most common types employ compressed gas—usually air—to atomize and direct the paint particles. <b>Spray</b> <b>guns</b> evolved from airbrushes, and the two are usually distinguished by their size {{and the size of}} the spray pattern they produce. Airbrushes are hand-held and used instead of a brush for detailed work such as photo retouching, painting nails or fine art. Air <b>gun</b> <b>spraying</b> uses equipment that is generally larger. It is typically used for covering large surfaces with an even coating of liquid. <b>Spray</b> <b>guns</b> can be either automated or hand-held and have interchangeable heads to allow for different spray patterns. Single color aerosol paint cans are portable and easy to store.|$|R

50|$|Due to graphene's {{distinctive}} properties, such as {{its high}} strength, high electron mobility, mechanical stiffness, and its remarkably well ability to conduct both electricity and heat, it serves a plethora of applications. Serving primarily {{in the field of}} electronics, several graphene applications include its usage within flexible touch screens, integrated circuits, reinforcement of electrical properties to plastics, biological engineering, optical electronics, energy storage, and photovoltaic cells. Graphene may also be utilized in the field of composite materials and nanotechnology. With the implementation of a graphene <b>spray</b> <b>gun,</b> the material may be evenly dispersed upon a large-scale substrate.

50|$|The {{processing}} {{steps are}} very similar to those in hand lay-up. In this process, the release agent is first applied to the mould and then a layer of gelcoat is applied. The gelcoat is left for two hours, until it hardens. Once the gelcoat hardens, a <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> is used to deposit the fibre resin mixture onto the surface of the mould. The <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> chops the incoming continuous rovings (one or more rovings) to a predetermined length and impels it through the resin/catalyst mixture. Resin/catalyst mixing can take place inside the gun (gun mixing) or {{just in front of the}} gun. Gun mixing provides thorough mixing of resin and catalyst inside the gun and is preferred to minimize the health hazard concerns of the operator. In the other type, the catalyst is sprayed through two side nozzles into the resin envelope. Airless spray guns are becoming popular because they provide more controlled spray patterns and reduced emission of volatiles. In an airless system, hydraulic pressure is used to dispense the resin through special nozzles that break up the resin stream into small droplets which then become saturated with the reinforcements. In an air-atomized <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> system, pressurized air is used to dispense the resin.|$|E
