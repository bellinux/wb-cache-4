50|$|Invertase is {{an enzyme}} that catalyzes the {{hydrolysis}} (breakdown) of sucrose (table sugar). Alternate names for invertase include , <b>saccharase,</b> glucosucrase, beta-h-fructosidase, beta-fructosidase, invertin, sucrase, maxinvert L 1000, fructosylinvertase, alkaline invertase, acid invertase, and the systematic name: beta-fructofuranosidase. The resulting mixture of fructose and glucose is called inverted sugar syrup. Related to invertases are sucrases. Invertases and sucrases hydrolyze sucrose {{to give the}} same mixture of glucose and fructose. Invertases cleave the O-C(fructose) bond, whereas the sucrases cleave the O-C(glucose) bond.|$|E

40|$|The study {{concerns}} the maltase, <b>saccharase,</b> lactase and alkaline phosphatase activity in small intestinal biopsy specimens from 61 consecutively admitted, untreated, Caucasian cystic fibrosis patients. A group of 319 age matched controls admitted {{during the same}} time period for undefined gastrointestinal or nutritional disorders acted as the controls. In order to eliminate morphological damage as a confounding factor, the enzyme activities were studied in small intestinal biopsy specimens having both normal stereomicroscopic and histological features. It was shown that neither maltase nor <b>saccharase</b> activity was different in the two groups, in contrast to lactase and alkaline phophatase activity, that was significantly lower in cystic fibrosis patients. The differences could not be explained by the nutritional status as judged by the body mass index. Lactase activity is known to be easily affected by numerous enteropathies. As the information on alkaline phosphatase activity is limited, the low activity is discussed in more detail. Taking into account the literature data, the low alkaline phophatase activity is tentatively attributed either to enhanced release from the brush border or to the faulty handling of alkaline phophatase protein in the post-golgi compartments secondary to the accumulation of incorrectly glycosylated CFTR in the same cell structures...|$|E
40|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} (AM) fungi are ubiquitous fungi distributed {{widely in}} soil ecosystems. It has been showed that AM fungi {{play an important}} role in improving soil nutrition and enhancing crop disease resistance, which have great application potentials in overcoming crop replant problems. In order to evaluate the effects of AM fungi on soil microbe population and soil enzyme activities in replant soils, three replant soils respectively with 3, 7, and 12 watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) replanting years were employed to be investigated. Results showed that the total soil microbe, bacteria, and actinomycete population, and the activities of soil proteinase, polyphenoloxidase, urease, and <b>saccharase</b> in replant soils gradually declined, while the fungal population, and the fungi/total microbe ratio increased, as replanting years rose. In each replant soil, the inoculation with AM fungus Glomus versiforme enhanced soil bacteria and actinomycete population, and decreased the fungal numbers, and the fungi/total microbe ratio in replanting soils, and improved soil proteinase, polyphenoloxidase, urease, and <b>saccharase</b> activities, compared with controls. That contributed to the relative equilibrium of the three kinds of soil microorganism populations. It is concluded that the AM fungal inoculation can reduce watermelon replant problems through effectively modifying the soil microbe population and community structure, and increasing the soil enzyme activities...|$|E

The experiment was conducted near Bonn, on a Fluvisol using a {{randomised complete block design}} (n= 6). Our results showed that plots which received either prepared or non-prepared FYM (30 Mg ha− 1 year− 1) had significantly increased soil pH, P and K concentrations, microbial biomass, dehydrogenase activity, decomposition (cotton strips), earthworm cast production and altered earthworm community composition than plots without FYM application. Application of FYM did not affect the soil C/N ratio, root length density, <b>saccharase</b> activity, microbial basal respiration, metabolic quotient and crop yields. The biodynamic preparation of FYM with fermented residues of six plant species (6 g Mg− 1 FYM) significantly decreased soil microbial basal respiration and metabolic quotient compared to non-prepared FYM or FYM prepared with only Achillea. The biodynamic preparation did not affect soil microbial biomass, dehydrogenase activity and decomposition during 62 days. However, after 100 days, decomposition was significantly faster in plots which received completely prepared FYM than in plots which received no FYM, FYM without preparations or FYM with the Achillea preparation. Furthermore, the application of completely prepared FYM led to significantly higher biomass and abundance of endogeic or anecic earthworms than in plots where non-prepared FYM was applied...|$|E

The purpose of the given work was estimation of catalase protease and urease activity on three different types of soil as high mountained steppe and dry steppe roughly humusified soil; mealy brown carbonated soil and mountain meadow forest soil which are common in the mountain and steppe regions of our country in correlation with soil depth and anthropogenic impacts. In all soil samples the highest enzymatic activities were detected in the depth of 0 - 15 cm from the soil surface.

40|$|Background. Intestinal {{ischemia}} {{is often}} {{caused by a}} malperfusion of the upper mesenteric artery. Since the intestinal mucosa {{is one of the}} most rapidly proliferating organs in human body, this tissue can partly regenerate itself after the onset of ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). Therefore, we investigated whether glycine, sodium pyruvate, and resveratrol can either support or potentially harm regeneration when applied therapeutically after reperfusion injury. Methods. I/R of the small intestine was initiated by occluding and reopening the upper mesenteric artery in rats. After 60 [*]min of ischemia and 300 [*]min of reperfusion, glycine, sodium pyruvate, or resveratrol was administered intravenously. Small intestine regeneration was analyzed regarding tissue damage, activity of <b>saccharase,</b> and Ki- 67 positive cells. Additionally, systemic parameters and metabolic ones were obtained at selected periods. Results. Resveratrol failed in improving the outcome after I/R, while glycine showed a partial beneficial effect. Sodium pyruvate ameliorated metabolic acidosis, diminished histopathologic tissue injury, and increased cell proliferation in the small intestine. Conclusion. While glycine could improve in part regeneration but not proliferation, sodium pyruvate seems to be a possible therapeutic agent to facilitate proliferation and to support mucosal regeneration after I/R injury to the small intestine...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Invertases (EC 3. 2. 1. 26) are hydrolases that cleave sucrose {{into the}} monosacccharides, glucose, and fructose. They {{play a central}} role in carbohy-drate {{metabolism}} of plants and animals. Methods presented so far to quantify invertase activity in ants or other animals have been hampered by the variabil-ity in both substrates and products of the enzymatic reaction in animals whose carbohydrate metabolism is highly active. Our method is based on a spectropho-tometric quantification of the kinetics of glucose release. We first obtained an equilibrium state summarizing reactions of any carbohydrates and enzymes that are present in the extract. Sucrose was then added to quantify invertase activ-ity as newly released glucose. Invertase activities differed significantly among species of ants. Variances were lowest among individuals from the same colony and highest among different species. When preparations were made from ants of the same species, invertase activity was linearly related to the number of ants used for extraction. Our method does not require ants to be kept on specific substrates prior to the experiment, or expensive or large equipment. It, thus, appears suitable for dealing with a broad range of physiological, ecological, and evolutionary questions.

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the enzyme content of the {{isolated}} cell walls and of a plasma-membrane preparation obtained by centrifugation after enzymic digestion of the cell walls of baker's yeast. The isolated cell walls showed no hexokinase, alkaline phosphatase, esterase or NADH oxidase activity. It was concluded that these enzymes exist only in the interior of the cell. Further, only a negligible activity of deamidase was detectable in the cell walls. Noticeable amounts of <b>saccharase,</b> phosphatases hydrolysing p-nitrophenyl phosphate, ATP, ADP, thiamin pyrophosphate and PPi, with optimum activity at pH 3 – 4, and an activity of Mg 2 +-dependent adenosine triphosphatase at neutral pH, were found in the isolated cell walls. During enzymic digestion, the other activities appearing in the cell walls were mostly released into the medium, but the bulk of the Mg 2 +-dependent adenosine triphosphatase remained in the plasma-membrane preparation. Accordingly, it may be assumed that the enzymes released into the medium during digestion are located in the cell wall outside the plasma membrane, whereas the Mg 2 +-dependent adenosine triphosphatase is an enzyme of the plasma membrane. This enzyme differs from the phosphatases with pH optima in the range pH 3 – 4 with regard to location, pH optimum, substrate specificity and different requirement of activators...|$|E

With respect to the total nitrogen content (Nt %) a similar situation can be found. Investigations in upper soil horizons, carried out for 5 places in Spitsbergen, showed that one of the soils studied was very little developed with 51, 000 colony forming units (cfu) /g dried soil while four soils were more developed with 233, 600 - 695, 000 cfu/g dry wt. Heterotrophie, aerobic, non-sporogenous and Gram-negative bacteria are typical for the rhizosphere. Micromycetes, however, were very scarce, soil respiration and cellulolytic potentials were similar to those found in acid and cold soils of Romania (temperate climate). The five soils were enzymatically tested for: catalase, <b>saccharase,</b> urease and total phosphatase potentials. It is important to underline that the biotic and enzymatic potentials of the four more developed soils from Spitsbergen are comparable with the poorer soils from Romania.

40|$|We used DNA-based {{pyrosequencing}} {{to characterize}} the bacterial community structure of the sandy soil of an apple orchard with different manure ratios. Five manure percentages (5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 % and 25 %) were examined. More than 10, 000 valid reads were obtained for each replicate. The communities were composed of five dominant groups (Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria and Bacteroidetes), of which Proteobacteria content gradually decreased from 41. 38 % to 37. 29 % as manure ratio increased from 0 % to 25 %, respectively. Redundancy analysis showed that 37 classes were highly correlated with manure ratio, 18 of which were positively correlated. Clustering revealed that the rhizosphere samples were grouped into three components: low manure (control, 5 %) treatment, medium manure (10 %, 15 %) treatment and high manure (20 %, 25 %) treatment. Venn analysis of species types of these three groups revealed that the bacteria community difference was primarily reflected by quantity ratio rather than species variety. Although greater manure content led to higher soil organic matter content, the medium manure improved soil showed the highest urease activity and <b>saccharase</b> activity, while 5 % to 20 % manure ratio improvement also resulted in higher bacteria diversity than control and 25 % manure ratio treatment.

Objective To investigate the pathophysiology of small intestine in chronic pancreatitis and to show the reason why in some cases pancreatic enzyme substitution does not work properly. Patients In the process of the study 33 chronic pancreatitis patients have been examined. Controls The control group includes 30 subjects without chronic pancreatitis similar for age, sex and alcohol consumption to the patients with chronic pancreatitis patients. Investigations Aspiration biopsy of jejunum mucosa followed by histological examination and investigation of intestinal enzymes by aspiration has been performed.

40|$|The {{re-establishment}} {{of natural}} species-rich heath lands on abandoned farmland {{is one of}} the main measures in soil erosion control in the Loess Plateau of China. So, it is important to understand how the vegetation and soil properties develop after land abandonment. The objective of this study was to determine how physico-chemical properties, microbial biomass, and enzyme activities changed for abandoned farmland with an age sequence of 0, 1, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50 years in Zhifanggou watershed (8. 27 km(2)), Shaanxi Province, NW China. The results of this study indicate that species succession after land abandonment in the Zhifanggou watershed on the Loess Plateau resulted in a significant improvement in soil chemical and microbiological properties. Soil organic C, total N, available N and K, soil microbial biomass C, N and P, as well as alkaline phosphatase, catalase, <b>saccharase,</b> and cellulase activity increased with time since plantation establishment increased. In contrast, soil bulk density, pH, and polyphenol oxidase activity decreased after farmland abandonment. Urease and alpha-amylase decreased until 15 years at the early phase of species succession, and then increased. However, there was no significant change in total P and available P during the restoration. Results only implied the tendency that the herbage was developing toward shrub. Although secondary succession plays an important role which improved soil properties after farmland abandonment, the values of these parameters were still much lower than native forest in 50 years. Thus, vegetation recovery after farmland abandonment in a semi-arid environment would be slow and the improvement of soil properties in the Loess Plateau is likely to require a considerably long period of time...|$|E
40|$|Severe {{soil and}} water loss has led to {{widespread}} land degradation of the Loess Plateau, China. During the past two decades, significant efforts {{have been made to}} revegetate degraded soil in the region. However, {{a better understanding of the}} ability of plants to promote soil microbial processes is important for successful revegetation. The current study was conducted at the Dunshan watershed on the Loess Plateau, with the aim of evaluating the effect of different vegetation types on the microbial properties of rhizosphere soil. Six vegetation types were evaluated: two natural grassland (Artemisia capillaries and Heteropappus altaicus), two artificial (i. e. planted by humans) grassland (Astragalus adsurgens and Panicum virgatum) and two artificial shrubland (Caragana korshinskii and Hippophae rhamnoides) species; an area without vegetation cover was used as a control. The results indicated that the highest values of soil organic C, total nitrogen (TN), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), MBN, <b>saccharase,</b> urease, catalase and peroxidase were recorded for H. altaicus and A. capillaries; of basal respiration (BR), the MBN: TN ratio, alkaline phosphatase and polyphenol oxidase for A. adsurgens; and of the BR: MBC ratio for P. virgatum. A rhizosphere soil microbial index (RSMI) was obtained using principal component analysis, and metabolic quotient (BR/MBC), BR, urease, water-soluble C and cellulase were found to be most important for assessing rhizosphere soil quality. All revegetated soil showed higher RSMI compared with control soil, with soil under natural grassland species (H. altaicus and A. capillaries) recording the highest value. It was concluded that plant species under arid climatic conditions have different effects on the microbial properties of rhizosphere soil owing to their different root exudates and plant debris. In addition, natural grasslands are most effective for revegetation of the Loess Plateau. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

In addition to the effects of fertilizer doses, correlations among soil chemical and microbiological properties were established; and the various ratios among some microbiological parameters were also evaluated. The elements of NPK fertilizers increased together with the doses, so the elements’ effect cannot be separated, the minimum factor is not identifiable. With increasing fertilizer doses, the soil pH decreased in both the mono- and triculture, parallelly there was a significant increase in hydrolytic acidity. A close negative correlation was proved between the pH(H 2 O) and hydrolytic acidity and pH(KCl) and hydrolytic acidity. An increased soil nutrient content was recorded in each NPK treatment, the available phosphorus and nitrate content increased in a higher proportion than that of potassium. Among the measured parameters of the carbon and nitrogen cycles fertilization had a positive influence on the organic carbon (OC), organic nitrogen (ON), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) contents, the number of cellulose decomposing and nitrifying bacteria, the nitrate exploration and CO 2 -production, while it mainly had negative effects on the investigated enzymes (<b>saccharase</b> and urease) activity. Evaluating the ratios among the measured parameters, fertilization seems to have promoted the increase in nitrogen-containing organic compounds, because the OC/ON and MBC/MBN ratios decreased due to the effect of different doses of NPK fertilizers in both cultures. ...|$|E

In the past two decades, great efforts {{have been made to}} restore degraded soil such as reconverting croplands into forestlands or grasslands. A comparison of soil qualities of different revegetation types has important implications in soil reclamation. Our study investigated the effect of different revegetation types on the physicochemical and microbial soil properties in the Loess Plateau, with the aim of determining which revegetation type has the best capacity for soil recovery. The vegetation types included two shrublands (Caragana korshinskii and Hippophae rhamnoides), two grasslands (Astragalus adsurgens and Panicum virgatum), and two species from croplands that were abandoned for natural recovery (Artemisia capillaries and Heteropappus altaicus). Among the plants studied, H. altaicus and A. capillaries had the highest values of soil organic C, total N, total P, available N, available P, moisture content, microbial biomass C (MBC), substrate-induced respiration, <b>saccharase,</b> urease, catalase, and peroxidase. Soil sampled from the A. adsurgens plot had the highest bulk density and microbial biomass N, and soil from the H. rhamnoides plot had the highest metabolic quotient (basal respiration/MBC). The soil quality index, which was obtained based on the available N, metabolic quotient, MBC, urease, polyphenol oxidase, and bulk density, shows that the abandoned cropland for natural recovery had the highest soil quality, followed by grassland, and then shrubland. Vegetation types affect the physicochemical and microbial properties of soils in arid climatic conditions. Abandoned cropland for natural recovery has the best capacity for improving soil quality in the Loess Plateau among all studied revegetation types.

30|$|LEfSe {{analysis}} was performed to identify significantly different genera between NPK and MPK treatments. Genera with negative impacts on soil quality were overrepresented in the NPK regime, i.e. Sphingomonas, Xanthomonas, Rhodanobacter and Nitrosospira, while they were present at low levels in the MPK treatment group. Multiple species of Sphingomonas and Xanthomonas are considered animal and plant pathogens (White et al. 1996; Barak et al. 2016). Rhodanobacter is likely involved in the denitrifying process leading to N losses in low pH soil (Green et al. 2012). Furthermore, besides ammonia oxidation, members in Nitrosospira can perform nitrified denitrification, resulting in reduced conversion of nitrite to N 2 O and emission of greenhouse gas (Shaw et al. 2006). In addition, MPK treatment increased the abundance of beneficial genera, such as Variovorax, Chthoniobacter, Massilia, Lysobacter, Catelliglobosispora and Steroidobacter. Variovorax {{is considered to be}} a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium (Jiang et al. 2012) and Chthoniobacter plays important roles in carbohydrate metabolism (Brewer et al. 2016). Species in Massilia and Lysobacter produce violacein (Myeong et al. 2016) and lytic enzymes (Li et al. 2008) that allow them to colonize plant roots and protect against infection by soil-borne plant pathogens (Ko et al. 2009; Ofek et al. 2012). Similarly, higher abundances of Catelliglobosispora and Steroidobacter in the MPK treatment group may indicate improved soil <b>saccharase</b> (Sun et al. 2014) and catalase activity (Sakai et al. 2014), respectively. However, Blastocatella and Nitrospira were also increased, suggesting an increase in ammonia oxidation (Alma et al. 2016) and nitrite oxidation through the nitrification process (Wu et al. 2016). Wu et al. (2017 a) explored the effects of fertilizer application over a 20 -year period on soil N transformation and found that inorganic fertilizer plus manure increased N mineralization rate and available soil N. However, in practical applications it should be considered that higher N nitrification is also induced by manure application, which may lead to increased N losses (Wu et al. 2017 a).|$|E
40|$|Os insetos possuem diferentes enzimas digestivas que catalisam as reações de hidrólise do alimento consumido e essas se diferenciam entre os insetos de acordo com suas dietas e estado fisiológico. Foram avaliadas as atividades de algumas enzimas digestivas da praga do cafeeiro - Leucoptera coffeella (Guérin-Mèneville & Perrottet, 1842) (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae) - popularmente conhecida como bicho-mineiro do cafeeiro, para o entendimento de seu processo digestivo. Lagartas do bicho-mineiro do cafeeiro foram coletadas em campo e em casa-de-vegetação. O extrato enzimático utilizado foi obtido pela maceração das lagartas em água (4 ºC). Determinaram-se os pH's ótimos e as atividades das enzimas &# 945; e &# 946;-glicosidases, &# 945;-amilase, aminopeptidase, fosfatase alcalina, sacarase, trealase e tripsina, incubando o extrato enzimático do bicho-mineiro do cafeeiro com substratos específicos. A análise dos resultados sugere que o processo digestivo e o ambiente {{intestinal}} do bicho-mineiro do cafeeiro sejam similares com o dos demais lepidópteros encontrados na literatura. Insects are {{fitted with}} different digestive enzymes that catalyses the food hydrolysis. Those enzymes differ from one insect to another {{according to their}} diets and physiological status. In this work, one intended to verify the activities of some digestive enzymes of the coffee leaf miner - Leucoptera coffeella (Guérin-Mèneville & Perrottet, 1842) (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae) - as a pre-requisite to understand its digest process, since this insect is a major plague in coffee production systems. Coffee leaf miner caterpillars were collected in fields and in greenhouse. The enzyme extract utilized in determining the enzyme activities was obtained through grinding the caterpillars in cold water. The optimum pH and {{the activities of the}} enzymes &# 945; and &# 946;-glucosidases, &# 945;-amylase, aminopeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, <b>saccharase,</b> trehalase and trypsin were measured by incubating the enzyme extract with specific substrates. The analysis of the optimum pH's indicated that the digestive process and intestinal environment of this insect are similar to another lepidopterans consulted in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Hypolactasia {{associated}} with severe iron-deficiency anemia {{has been reported}} in several studies. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine whether hypolactasia is {{associated with}} the degree and duration of iron-deficiency anemia. Newly weaned male Wistar rats were divided into a control group receiving a diet supplemented with iron (C) and an experimental group (E) receiving a diet not supplemented with iron (iron-deficiency diet). The animals were studied on the 3 rd, 5 th, 7 th, 14 th, 21 st, 28 th and 35 th days of the experiment, when overall and iron nutritional status and disaccharidase activity in the small intestine were determined by the Dahlqvist method. A reduction in weight occurred in the anemic animals starting on the 5 th day of the study. Anemia was present in the experimental animals, with a progressive worsening up to the 14 th day (hemoglobin: C = 13. 27 and E = 5. 37) and stabilizing thereafter. <b>Saccharase</b> and maltase activities did not differ significantly between groups, whereas lactase showed a significant reduction in total (TA) and specific activity (SA) in the anemic animals starting on the 21 st day of the study. Median lactase TA for the C and E groups was 2. 27 and 1. 25 U on the 21 st day, 2. 87 and 1. 88 U on the 28 th day, and 4. 20 and 1. 59 U on the 35 th day, respectively. Median lactase SA was 0. 31 and 0. 20 U/g wet weight on the 21 st day, 0. 39 and 0. 24 U/g wet weight on the 28 th day, and 0. 42 and 0. 23 U/g wet weight on the 35 th day, respectively. These findings suggest a relationship between the enzymatic alterations observed and both the degree and duration of the anemic process. Analysis of other studies on intestinal disaccharidases in anemia suggests that the mechanism of these changes may be functional, i. e., that the enterocytes may suffer a reduction in their ability to synthesize these enzymes...|$|E
40|$|In a pot {{experiment}} {{the effect of}} bentonite and zeolite doses [0; 5; 10; 15 and 20 g·kg soil- 1] was studied on some chemical properties and ten soil microbiological and enzymological properties of an acidic [pH(H 2 O) = 5. 65] humic sandy soil [WRB: Lamellic Arenosol (Dystric) ], {{as well as on}} the biomass of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), as test plant. The {{pot experiment}} was set up in 2007 and 2008 at the Department of Agrochemistry and Soil Science of the Debrecen University in three replications. The average results of the two year experiment can be summarized as follows: The pH increased due to the effect of small and medium amendment doses. The bentonite treatments proved to be more effective than the zeolite doses. As the pH increased, the hydrolytic acidity – in case of the bentonite treatments significantly – decreased. Concerning the easily available nutrient content of soil, the small and medium amendment doses turned out to be effective. The large bentonite doses reduced the nitrate-N content, the easily available phosphorus and potassium contents of soil. Large dose zeolite treatments decreased the nitrate-N content, but increased both the phosphorus and potassium content of soil, in most cases significantly. Regarding the measured soil microbial parameters, the small and medium amendment doses were the most effective. The bentonite and zeolite treatments increased the biomass of perennial ryegrass, especially the small and medium doses of bentonite and the large dose of zeolite brought about significant increases. According to the statistical analyses moderate and close correlations were found between the parameters studied. In the bentonite treatments a close correlation was established between the aerobic cellulose decomposing bacteria and <b>saccharase</b> enzyme activity (r = 0. 864) of soil. In the case of zeolite treatments, a close correlation was found between the number of nitrifying bacteria and microbial biomass C (r = 0. 911) of soil...|$|E
40|$|Summary in English. The role of {{bacteria}} in the digestive tract of the abalone Haliotis midae was examined to determine whether bacteria aid hydrolysis of polysaccharides present in seaweeds which farmed abalone consume. The enteric bacteria were enumerated using culturable and total (DAPI) counts. The numbers of culturable bacteria fell between 3. 5 x 10 ⁵ and 2. 3 x 10 ⁸ cfu/g wet weight tissue. The DAPI counts were between 1. 6 x 10 ⁹ and 5. 1 x 10 ⁹ cells per gram of tissue. The numbers {{of bacteria}} differed between the crop, stomach and intestine. Electron microscopy showed that bacteria were present on the food and gut wall. No specialised structures, to aid adhesion of bacteria, were apparent on the gut wall. The isolated bacteria were identified to genus level using standard biochemical and morphological tests. The common genera identified were Vibrio, Alcaligenes, Flavobacteria, Pseudomonas and Aeromonas. The bacterial communities in each gut region varied, suggesting that both resident and transient bacterial populations are present in H. midae. Alcaligenes occurred mainly in the crop, while Vibrio species were predominant in the stomach and intestine. The bacterial isolates were tested {{for their ability to}} hydrolyse the polysaccharides alginate, laminarin, CMC, carrageenan and agarose. Bacteria able to utilise these polysaccharides belonged to the genera Flavobacteria, Pseudomonas, Vibrio, Alcaligenes, Bacillus and Enterobacteria. Many of the isolated bacteria were capable of utilising two or three of the substrates tested. Quantitative poly <b>saccharase</b> assays using the reducing sugar assays of Nelson (1944) and Somogyi (1952) and Gardner et al. (1988) were employed. These assays showed that bacteria from the crop exhibited the greatest degree of CMC and alginate hydrolysis. Bacteria from the intestine exhibited the greatest carrageenan and agarose hydrolysis. The endogenous enzymes produced by H. midae were examined using extracts of the hepatopancreas as it was found to be bacteria free. It was found that abalone synthesize a CMCase, laminarinase, alginase, carrageenanase and agarase. However, the synthesis of these enzymes was related to the diet of the abalone. Abalone fed Ecklonia (which contains relatively high concentrations of alginate and laminarin) exhibited significantly higher alginase and laminarinase activity than abalone fed Gracilaria. Similarly, abalone fed Gracilaria (which contains relatively high proportions of carrageenan and agar) produced significantly higher carrageenanase and agarase activity. Furthermore, these enzyme activities were found to be similar to those extracted from gnotobiotic abalone (obtained using the antibiotics chloramphenicol (250 μg/ml), ampicillin (600 μg/ml) and cefotaxime (250 μg/ml)), indicating that polysaccharide synthesis occurs in the hepatopancreas of H. midae. Polysaccharase assays on gnotobiotic abalone were compared to assays on untreated abalone. Bacteria were found to significantly enhance the polysaccharase activity of alginase, laminarinase and agarase hydrolysis...|$|E
