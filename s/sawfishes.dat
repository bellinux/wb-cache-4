5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships between}} the bowmouth guitarfish and other rays are debated. Morphological evidence generally points to a close relationship between Rhina, Rhynchobatus and Rhynchorhina, which are a group of rays known as the wedgefishes that also have large, shark-like fins. Morphological analyses have tended to place these two genera basally among rays, though some have them as basal to just the guitarfishes (Rhinobatidae) and skates (Rajidae) while others have them basal to all other rays except <b>sawfishes</b> (Pristidae). A 2012 study based on mitochondrial DNA upheld Rhina and Rhynchobatus as sister taxa related to the guitarfishes, but also unexpectedly found that they formed a clade with the <b>sawfishes</b> rather than the skates. Following the description of Rhynchorhina in 2016, a study of mtDNA found that {{it is part of}} the same group and their phylogenetic relationship is ((Rhynchobatus+Rhynchorhina)+Rhina).|$|E
25|$|Irrespective of {{the cause}} of their {{ultimate}} extinction, during the long time of their existence the pseudotooth birds furnished prey for large predators themselves. Few if any birds that coexisted with them were large enough to harm them while airborne; {{as evidenced by the}} Early Eocene Limnofregata, the frigatebirds coevolved with the Pelagornithidae and may well have harassed any of the small species for food on occasion, as they today harass albatrosses. From the Middle Miocene or Early Pliocene of the Lee Creek Mine, some remains of pseudotooth birds which probably fell victim to sharks while feeding are known. The large members of the abundant Lee Creek Mine shark fauna that hunted near the water's surface included the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus), Carcharias sand tiger sharks, Isurus and Cosmopolitodus mako sharks, Carcharodon white sharks, the snaggletooth shark Hemipristis serra, tiger sharks (Galeocerdo), Carcharhinus whaler sharks, the lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris) and hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna), and perhaps (depending on the bird fossils' age) also Pristis <b>sawfishes,</b> Odontaspis sand tiger sharks, and Lamna and Parotodus benedeni mackerel sharks. It is notable that fossils of smaller diving birds – for example auks, loons and cormorants – {{as well as those of}} albatrosses are much more commonly found in those shark pellets than pseudotooth birds, supporting the assumption that the latter had quite low population densities and caught much of their food in mid-flight.|$|E
500|$|The {{copper shark}} feeds more towards {{the bottom of}} the water column than the top, {{consuming}} cephalopods, including squid (Loligo spp.), cuttlefishes, and octopus; bony fishes, including gurnards, flatfishes, hakes, catfishes, jacks, Australian salmon, mullets, sea breams, smelts, tunas, sardines, and anchovies; and cartilaginous fishes, including dogfish sharks (Squalus spp.), stingrays, skates, electric rays, and <b>sawfishes.</b> Cephalopods and cartilaginous fishes become relatively more important food for sharks over [...] long. Young sharks also consume scyphozoan jellyfish and crustaceans, including mud shrimps (Callianassa) and penaeid prawns. It does not attack marine mammals, though has been known rarely to scavenge on dolphins that had succumbed to fishing nets. The predominant prey of this species off South Africa is the southern African pilchard (Sardinops sagax), which comprise 69–95% of its diet. Every winter, schools of copper sharks follow the [...] "run" [...] of the pilchard from the Eastern Cape to KwaZulu-Natal. The gathering of millions of forage fish attract a multitude of predators, including several species of sharks, of which copper sharks are the most numerous.|$|E
50|$|The {{smallest}} <b>sawfish</b> is {{the dwarf}} <b>sawfish</b> (P. clavata), which grows to 1.4 m, {{much smaller than}} the others. The largest species seem to be the large-tooth <b>sawfish</b> (P. microdon), the Leichhardt's <b>sawfish</b> (P. perotteti), and the common <b>sawfish</b> (P. pristis), which can all reach about 7 m in length. One southern <b>sawfish</b> was recorded as weighing 2455 kg. Such massive specimens that survive long enough to approach their maximum size and age are believed to have lifespans of about 51 years.|$|R

2500|$|The {{primary means}} by which fish {{generate}} thrust is by oscillating the body from side-to-side, the resulting wave motion ending at a large tail fin. Finer control, such as for slow movements, is often achieved with thrust from pectoral fins (or front limbs in marine mammals). [...] Some fish, e.g. the spotted ratfish (Hydrolagus colliei) and batiform fish (electric rays, <b>sawﬁshes,</b> guitarﬁshes, skates and stingrays) use their pectoral fins as the primary means of locomotion, sometimes termed labriform swimming. [...] Marine mammals oscillate their body in an up-and-down (dorso-ventral) direction.|$|E
60|$|Even as Aquareine spoke, {{they saw}} a swirl and commotion in the water ahead of them, while {{a sound like a}} muffled roar fell upon their ears. Then swiftly there dashed upon them a group of great fishes with long saws {{sticking}} out in front of their noses, armed with sharp, hooked teeth, all set in a row. They were larger than the swordfishes and seemed more fierce and bold. But the mermaids and Trot and Cap'n Bill quietly awaited their attack, and instead of tearing them with their saws as they expected to do, the fishes were unable to touch them at all. They tried every possible way to get at their proposed victims, but the Magic Circle was all powerful and turned aside the ugly saws; so our friends were not disturbed at all. Seeing this, the <b>sawfishes</b> soon abandoned the attempt and with growls and roars of disappointment swam away and were quickly out of sight.|$|E
40|$|Studies in the Fitzroy River {{commenced}} in 2001 {{and have}} been ongoing. Strong collaboration between indigenous organisations and communities {{has resulted in a}} number of important projects being completed. Projects have resulted in fish posters of the river’s fishes in five Aboriginal languages and an increased awareness {{of the importance of the}} river to endangered species, such as Freshwater <b>Sawfish,</b> Dwarf <b>Sawfish,</b> Northern River Sharks, Barnett River Gudgeon and Greenway’s Grunter. Species distributions and habitat associations have been completed and the biology of a number of species, including Barramundi, Freshwater <b>Sawfish,</b> Dwarf <b>Sawfish,</b> Bull Sharks and Lesser Salmon Catfish, determined. The diets and trophic relationships for many of the river’s fishes have been examined. Genetic work has compared the Fitzroy River populations of Barramundi, Freshwater <b>Sawfish</b> and Dwarf <b>Sawfish</b> to those elsewhere. Tagging (conventional, acoustic and satellite) studies for Freshwater <b>Sawfish</b> are ongoing...|$|R
5000|$|The {{smalltooth}} <b>sawfish</b> (Pristis pectinata), {{also known}} as the wide <b>sawfish,</b> is a <b>sawfish</b> of the family Pristidae. It is found in shallow tropical and subtropical waters in coastal parts of the Atlantic, including the Mediterranean, and uses estuarine nursery areas. Reports from elsewhere are now believed to be misidentifications of other species of <b>sawfish.</b> [...] This critically endangered species reaches a length of up to 7.6 m.|$|R
50|$|The {{body and}} head of a <b>sawfish</b> are flat, and they {{spend most of their}} time lying on the sea floor. Like rays, a <b>sawfish's</b> mouth and {{nostrils}} are on its flat underside. The mouth is lined with small, dome-shaped teeth for eating small fish and crustaceans, which the fish sometimes swallows whole. <b>Sawfish</b> breathe with two spiracles just behind the eyes that draw water to the gills. The skin is covered with tiny dermal denticles that give the fish a rough texture. <b>Sawfish</b> are usually light grey or brown; the smalltooth <b>sawfish,</b> Pristis pectinata, appears olive green.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sawfishes</b> have {{declined}} drastically and few records are recent in several regions. For example, <b>sawfishes</b> were once relatively {{common in the}} northeast Atlantic off West Africa, but few recent sightings are reported.|$|E
50|$|Sclerorhynchiformes is {{an order}} of extinct batoids with long, {{serrated}} rostrums {{very similar to those}} of sawsharks and <b>sawfishes.</b> While they are neither, they are more closely related to <b>sawfishes,</b> and are included alongside them in the clade Pristiorajea.|$|E
50|$|Although {{they are}} similar in appearances, sawsharks are {{distinct}} from <b>sawfishes.</b> <b>Sawfishes</b> have a much larger maximum size, lack barbels, have evenly sized rather than alternating sawteeth, and have gill slits on their undersurface {{rather than on the}} side of the head.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>sawfish's</b> most {{distinctive}} {{feature is the}} saw-like rostrum, covered with electrosensitive pores that allow the <b>sawfish</b> to detect slight movements of prey hiding in the muddy sea floor. The rostrum {{also serves as a}} digging tool to unearth buried crustaceans. Should suitable prey try to swim past, the normally lethargic <b>sawfish</b> springs from the bottom and slashes at it with its saw. This generally stuns or impales the prey sufficiently for the <b>sawfish</b> to devour it. <b>Sawfish</b> also defend themselves with their rostrum against intruding divers and predators such as sharks. The [...] "teeth" [...] protruding from the rostrum are not real teeth, but modified tooth-like structures called denticles.|$|R
50|$|The largetooth <b>sawfish</b> (Pristis microdon), {{also known}} as the Leichhardt's <b>sawfish</b> or {{freshwater}} <b>sawfish,</b> is a <b>sawfish</b> of the family Pristidae, found in shallow Indo-West Pacific oceans between latitudes 11° N and 39° S. As its relatives, it also enters freshwater. This species reaches a length of up to 7 m. Reproduction is ovoviviparous. Recent evidence strongly suggests P. microdon is synonymous with P. pristis. Consequently, the IUCN removed P. microdon from their list, instead recognizing it as part of the critically endangered P. pristis.|$|R
50|$|Smalltooth <b>sawfish</b> have {{recently}} been observed, for the first time, to reproduce parthenogenetically in the wild. About 3 percent of the <b>sawfish</b> living in a Florida estuary {{are the result of}} parthenogenesis. The research team speculates that since smalltooth <b>sawfish</b> are so rare, females might sometimes fail to find a male during the mating season, inducing the parthenogenetic process.|$|R
50|$|Sawsharks and <b>sawfishes</b> are {{cartilaginous}} fishes possessing large saws. However, <b>sawfishes</b> are not sharks, but {{a type of}} ray. The gill slits of the <b>sawfishes</b> are positioned on the underside like a ray, but the gill slits of the sawshark are positioned on the side like a shark. Another clear difference is that a sawfish has no barbels and a sawshark has a prominent pair halfway along the saw. The sawshark uses these like other bottom fish, {{as a kind of}} antennae, feeling the way along the ocean bottom until it finds some prey of interest.|$|E
5000|$|The {{classification}} of batoids is currently undergoing revision; however, molecular evidence refutes {{the hypothesis that}} skates and rays are derived sharks. Nelson's 2006 Fishes of the World recognizes four orders. The Mesozoic Sclerorhynchoidea are basal or incertae sedis; they show features of the Rajiformes but have snouts resembling those of <b>sawfishes.</b> However, evidence indicates they are probably the sister group to <b>sawfishes</b> ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Sawfishes</b> {{should not}} be {{confused}} with sawsharks (order Pristiophoriformes), or the extinct sclerorhynchids (order Sclerorhynchiformes) which have a similar appearance.|$|E
40|$|Environmental DNA (eDNA) is a {{relatively}} new tool for the detection of rare, threatened and invasive species in water bodies. In this study we investigated the utility of an eDNA approach in detecting the Critically Endangered largetooth <b>sawfish</b> Pristis pristis in freshwater habitats in northern Australia. Water samples were collected from large aquaria mesocosms containing largetooth <b>sawfish</b> and other aquatic species, and floodplain waterholes and the main river channel of the Daly River, Northern Territory. Water samples were filtered using a 20 mu m nylon filter. DNA was extracted from filters and analysed with PCR using species-specific mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) primers designed to amplify only largetooth <b>sawfish</b> DNA. PCR products were cleaned and the COI gene sequenced to confirm the species identity. Using 3 aquaria, with one containing a largetooth <b>sawfish,</b> this method positively identified <b>sawfish</b> only in the correct aquarium. In the field water samples, 7 of 8 floodplain waterholes produced a <b>sawfish</b> eDNA PCR product, while eDNA was not detected in the main river channel. Based on gillnet sampling and traditional ecological knowledge, largetooth <b>sawfish</b> were known to occur at half of the waterhole and floodplain sites that tested positive for <b>sawfish</b> eDNA. These results demonstrated that an eDNA approach to detecting largetooth <b>sawfish</b> can produce reliable outcomes and {{can be used as a}} survey tool to help with conservation efforts for this and other threatened elasmobranchs...|$|R
50|$|Capturing a <b>sawfish</b> {{is illegal}} in certain {{countries}} like the United States and Australia. The sale of smalltooth <b>sawfish</b> rostra is prohibited in the United States under the Endangered Species Act. Additionally, A. cuspidata, P. clavata, P. microdon, and P. zijsron {{are listed as}} candidates under that act. Since 2007, the import for sale of that of any <b>sawfish</b> species is also prohibited.|$|R
50|$|The longcomb <b>sawfish</b> {{or green}} <b>sawfish</b> (Pristis zijsron) is a <b>sawfish</b> {{of the family}} Pristidae, found in {{tropical}} waters of the Indo-West Pacific oceans, from the Red Sea and east Africa to Papua New Guinea, north to southern China, and south to New South Wales, Australia, between latitudes 21° N and 37° S.

50|$|<b>Sawfishes,</b> {{also known}} as {{carpenter}} sharks, are a family of rays characterized by a long, narrow, flattened rostrum, or nose extension, lined with sharp transverse teeth, arranged {{in a way that}} resembles a saw. Several species of <b>sawfishes</b> can grow to about 7 m. The family as a whole is largely unknown and little studied. The Pristidae are the only living family within the order Pristiformes, whose name comes from the πρίστης.|$|E
5000|$|All {{species of}} <b>sawfishes</b> {{are listed as}} Endangered or Critically Endangered by the IUCN, and face the threat of {{extinction}} {{as a result of}} habitat loss and overfishing. [...] Global populations of every species of <b>sawfishes</b> are estimated to have fallen to less than 10% of their historic levels, and they have been lost from at least 80% of their historic range. [...] The smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata), for example, was once widely distributed, but available data indicate the range of this species has been reduced by about 90%, and population numbers have declined dramatically, perhaps by 95% or more, although they still appear to retain a significant amount of genetic diversity. International commerce of <b>sawfishes</b> has been banned globally since 2007, with the only exception being for the provision of live Pristis microdon to appropriate public aquaria for primarily conservation purposes.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Sawfish</b> are a {{powerful}} symbol in many cultures. The Aztecs revered <b>sawfish</b> as an [...] "earth monster". Its rostrum {{is used by}} some Asian shamans for exorcisms and other ceremonies to repel demons and disease, which has contributed to its decline. The <b>sawfish</b> also notably served as the emblem of the German submarine U-96 (1940), known for its portrayal in Das Boot, and was later {{the symbol of the}} 9th U-Boat Flotilla. The German World War II [...] (Battle Badge of Small Combat Units) depicted a <b>sawfish.</b> These units used midget submarines, manned torpedoes, and explosive boats.|$|R
5000|$|Vertebrate {{biologist}} Barbara Wueringer, of the University of Queensland, {{demonstrated that}} <b>sawfish</b> use their extended rostrum {{to detect and}} manipulate prey. She observed the animals’ reaction to food already {{at the bottom of}} the tank, food falling from the water's surface, and introduced electric dipoles. [...] When the <b>sawfish</b> came across scraps of fish resting on the bottom of the tank, it used its rostrum to pin the “prey” down as it swam over and engulfed it. When food was identified as it fell through the water, the <b>sawfish</b> would approach its “prey” from the side and swiftly strike to impale the victim with the teeth of its saw. [...] Both of these cases support the respective digging and attacking behaviors expected from feeding <b>sawfish</b> in the wild. In order to show that <b>sawfish</b> use their beak to sense their surroundings, Wueringer placed electric dipoles throughout the tank to simulate the electrical signals that surround moving prey. [...] Just as the <b>sawfish</b> displayed different aggressive behaviors towards the “prey,” they also responded differently based on the electrical signals they received by either avoiding or approaching the signal source. With this evidence, the <b>sawfish</b> is now regarded as the only jawed fish to use its rostrum for both prey detection and manipulation.|$|R
50|$|The common <b>sawfish</b> (Pristis pristis) is {{a species}} of <b>sawfish,</b> family Pristidae. It is found {{worldwide}} in tropical and subtropical coastal regions, but also enters freshwater. It has declined drastically and is considered critically endangered.|$|R
5000|$|While fins {{from many}} shark species {{are used in}} the trade, certain shark species have been {{identified}} over the centuries as supplying the tastiest and most succulent fins. The shark-like rays (the <b>sawfishes</b> and shovelnose rays) supply the highest quality fin. As observed by one of the leading treatises on shark trade, [...] "The ... fins ... from the white-spotted guitarfish spp. are considered to be most valuable. The preferred shark species for fins are tiger, mako, sawfish, sandbar, bull, hammerhead, blacktip, porbeagle, thresher and blue shark." [...] The fins from the critically endangered <b>sawfishes</b> [...] "are highly favored in Asian markets and {{are some of the most}} valuable shark fins." [...] <b>Sawfishes</b> are now protected under the highest protection level of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), Appendix I, but given the great volume of the shark fin trade, and that detached shark fins are difficult to identify, it is unlikely that CITES protection will prevent sawfish fins from entering the trade.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{targeted}} surveys, {{together with}} the collection of <b>sawfish</b> (Pristidae) rostra from the general public, have demonstrated that the Kimberley and northern Pilbara are important refuges for <b>sawfish,</b> with four of the world's seven species found here. These comprise all of Australia's known <b>sawfish</b> species, including the three species protected under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act 1999, i. e. Freshwater <b>Sawfish</b> (Pristis microdon), Dwarf <b>Sawfish</b> (Pristis clavata) and Green <b>Sawfish</b> (Pristis zijsron). The Northern River Shark (Glyphis garricki), which was only described in 2008, has only recently been discovered in the Kimberley and is listed as Endangered under the EPBC Act. These species are listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List and collectively represent ~ 45 % of Australia's elasmobranchs that are listed as Vulnerable or higher under the EPBC Act. There is, however, limited information on the spatial extent of these species throughout Western Australia, particularly as most <b>sawfish</b> surveys have targeted only a few specific areas over a vast coastline. We therefore encouraged public participation in providing Pristis rostra, taken from the fish as curios, in order to extend the known locations of the species and relate these to life history stages based on their size. Here {{we report on the}} published records and our unpublished catches (n = 376) across three Pristis spp., and collate this with data from donated rostra, 73 % (n = 283) of which were considered usable, in that catch locations were reliable and they were from Western Australian waters. We provide information on <b>sawfish</b> distributions in Western Australia and identify areas that are important as pupping grounds, nursery areas or harbour mature individuals.
