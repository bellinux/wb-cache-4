5|$|Akihiro Kitamura as Katsuro, a Japanese tourist {{and front}} {{section of the}} centipede. Having already acted in or written {{for a number of}} films and {{television}} shows (including popular American television series Heroes), Kitamura was a relatively experienced actor compared to other cast members. He auditioned for the role of Katsuro via Skype from Los Angeles after the casting director <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> television and recommended him for the role. The rest of the cast did not meet Kitamura until the day before shooting commenced.|$|E
5|$|Ahmed Best as Jar Jar Binks, {{a clumsy}} Gungan exiled {{from his home}} and taken in by Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. Best was hired after casting {{director}} Robin Gurland <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> a Stomp performance in San Francisco. Best was originally intended to provide motion capture data but his offer to voice the character was accepted. On the set, to provide references for the actors, Best was clothed in a suit made of foam and latex and a headpiece. Best's filmed performance was later replaced with the computer-generated character. Best frequently improvised movements to make Jar Jar look as clumsy and comedic as possible.|$|E
5|$|As a senator, Walker {{continued}} {{to focus on}} finance, although his views on social policy sometimes <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the outside of his party. He supported the White Australia policy but disagreed with key elements, and was a leader {{in opposition to the}} dictation test, by which a potential immigrant was required to pass a test in any European language before their application was accepted. He also campaigned for a transcontinental railway and for a capital city to be located on federal territory. Attempts to guide financial reform through the parliament as a backbench senator led to frustration, and Walker retired due to ill health in 1913 with his legislation unpassed.|$|E

5|$|Instability and {{violence}} marked the family: it moved frequently, {{and much of}} Lépine's early childhood was spent in Costa Rica and Puerto Rico, where his father was working for a Swiss mutual funds company. The family returned to Montreal permanently in 1968, shortly before a stock market crash led {{to the loss of}} much of the family's assets. Rachid was an authoritarian, possessive and jealous man, frequently violent towards his wife and his children. He had contempt for women and believed that they were intended only to serve men. He required his wife to act as his personal secretary, slapping her if she made any errors in typing, and forcing her to retype documents in spite of the cries of their toddler. He was also neglectful and abusive towards his children, particularly his son, and discouraged any tenderness, as he considered it spoiling. In 1970, following an incident in which Rachid struck Gamil so hard that the marks on his face were visible a week later, his mother decided to leave. The legal separation was finalized in 1971, and the divorce in 1976. Following the separation, Gamil lived with his mother and younger sister Nadia; soon after, their home and possessions were seized when Rachid defaulted on mortgage payments. Gamil was afraid of his father, and at first <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> weekly supervised visits. The visits ended quickly, as Rachid ceased contact with his children soon after the separation. Gamil never again saw his father, and in the future refused to discuss him with others.|$|E

25|$|Milt Stegall {{joined the}} Bombers in 1995 after a three-year career {{returning}} kicks and seeing spot duty at receiver with the Cincinnati Bengals. He {{played in the}} Bombers' final six games of the 1995 season, racking up 469 receiving yards. In 1997, Stegall set a new league record that still stands today for average gain per reception with 26.5yards on 61 catches for 1616yards, including 14 touchdowns. Following a brief return to the NFL, that <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the verge of making the Green Bay Packers if not for a serious knee injury {{at the end of}} training camp, Stegall remained the team's primary receiver.|$|E
25|$|Mummert later led the 14th Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion of the {{reformed}} 14th Panzer Division, the original having been {{destroyed in the}} Battle of Stalingrad. His leadership style often <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the frontlines with his infantry and engaged in close combat, and he received several badges in recognition of this; the Panzer Badge and Close Combat Clasp, both in bronze, {{as well as the}} Tank Destruction Badge for Individual Combatants. He was given command of the 14th Panzer Division's 103rd Panzer Grenadier Regiment in January 1944. Promoted to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel), he was awarded the Oak Leaves to his Knight's Cross. Nine months later, and now an oberst (colonel), he briefly led the 14th Panzer Division as its temporary commander. In October 1944, he was awarded the Swords to the Knight's Cross, the 107th recipient of this award.|$|E

John Fogerty, frontman for the Creedence Clearwater Revival, has stated that the band's song [...] "Lookin' Out My Back Door" [...] was partly inspired by the book.|$|E
500|$|She {{moved back}} to Arizona in early 1984 and {{gave birth to the}} couple's daughter, Meghan, later that year. [...] She {{subsequently}} gave birth to sons John Sidney IV (known as [...] "Jack") in 1986 and James (known as [...] "Jimmy") in 1988. [...] Their fourth child, Bridget, was adopted in 1991. [...] Cindy McCain's parents lived across the street and helped her raise the children; her husband was frequently in Washington and she typically only <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> weekends and holidays. [...] In his absence, she organized elaborate fund-raisers for him and expanded their home.|$|E
500|$|He lived a frugal existence, {{his only}} source of income being a £20-a-week {{retainer}} he received from Island Records (...) [...] At one point he could not afford {{a new pair of}} shoes. He would often disappear for days, sometimes turning up unannounced at friends' houses, uncommunicative and withdrawn. Robert Kirby described a typical visit: [...] "He would arrive and not talk, sit down, listen to music, have a smoke, have a drink, sleep there the night, and two or three days later he wasn't there, he'd be gone. And three months later he'd be back." [...] Nick's supervision partner at Cambridge, John Venning, once <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> a tube train in London and felt he was seriously clinically depressed. [...] "There was something about him which suggested that he would have looked straight through me and not registered me at all. So I turned around." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the false}} {{breaking}} news story, Lester Holt references the 2007 monster movie Cloverfield. After {{learning about the}} toxic leaks in the building, in which Frank, Toofer, and Lutz need to strip down, Frank says [...] "So much of my life was wasted creating hats!" [...] This is a reference to Judah Friedlander, who portrays Frank in the show and {{who is known for}} his trademark trucker hats which he wears {{in and out of the}} Frank character. When Liz tells Floyd that she <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> The Today Show, on which she learned he is getting married, Floyd says [...] "Dammit! I could have sworn you watch The Early Show on CBS", to which Liz replies, [...] "The Early Show? What am I, in a hospital?". Liz reveals that she once participated in a reenactment on America's Most Wanted playing a woman who is strangled on a toilet. Jenna and Tracy, who are having strange dreams about Kenneth, decide they [...] "have to Elm Street this. We have to go to sleep and kill Kenneth in our dreams!" [...] This references the A Nightmare on Elm Street film series, in which the movie's main character—Freddy Krueger—stalks and kills his victims in their dreams.|$|E
500|$|Various {{artists have}} written songs {{entitled}} Glastonbury {{or about the}} festival including Nizlopi, The Waterboys and Scouting for Girls. Cosmic Rough Riders included [...] "Glastonbury Revisited" [...] on their album Enjoy The Melodic Sunshine (Poptones) in 2000. Amy Macdonald, in her song [...] "Let's Start a Band" [...] referenced Glastonbury: [...] "Give me a festival and I'll be your Glastonbury star." [...] Robbie Williams, in his song [...] "The 90s", refers to his surprise appearance on stage with Oasis in 1995, which ultimately led to him leaving Take That: [...] "Everybody's worried 'what the fuck's wrong with Robbie? He's not answering his phone, he's not talking to me, I <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the telly at Glastonbury'." [...] Joe Strummer wrote the song [...] "Coma Girl" [...] about his experiences at Glastonbury, — in a BBC interview Bruce Springsteen cited the song as inspiring him to play the 2009 festival. U2 wrote a song titled [...] "Glastonbury" [...] {{that was supposed to}} premier with their appearance at the festival, but an injury to Bono forced them to cancel. They instead premiered it in a concert in Turin on their 360° Tour. Marcus Brigstocke's comic creation Giles Wemmbley Hogg had a special mock-documentary made about him going to Glastonbury as part of the Giles Wemmbley-Hogg Goes Off series. Deborah Crombie's novel A Finer End takes place in Glastonbury with references to a fictional account of an original 1914 Glastonbury Fayre as well as the contemporary festival. Glastonbury is also a setting in John Osborne's 2014 Radio 4 show The New Blur Album. Roxy Music did a song and album called Avalon, which is the ancient name for Glastonbury (Isle of Avalon).|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{himself had}} to ditch {{into the sea}} on 10April, {{when he was shot}} down after being {{surprised}} by three Zeros during another of his solo reconnaissance missions near Lae. After playing dead beside his crashed plane to discourage the Japanese fighters from machine-gunning him, he swam to shore and made his way through jungle for over a week to Wau, with the help of two New Guinea natives. When he arrived back at Port Moresby in a US Douglas Dauntless on 23April, a Japanese air raid was in progress and a bullet cut off the tip of his right index finger. Having survived his trek through the jungle, he dismissed the wound as [...] "a mere scratch". On 27April, Jackson met with his pilots and revealed that some senior RAAF officers had expressed dissatisfaction with the way in which No.75 Squadron was avoiding dogfighting with the Japanese Zeros. Jackson and his men had generally eschewed such tactics owing to the Zero's superiority to the Kittyhawk in close combat. The senior officers' comments had evidently stung him, however, as he declared to his pilots: [...] "Tomorrow I'm going to show you how". According to journalist Osmar White, who <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the night of the 27th, Jackson's [...] "hands and eyes were still and rock steady" [...] but he appeared [...] "weary in soul" [...] and [...] "too long in the shadows". White concluded: [...] "He had done more than conquer fear—he had killed it". The next day, Jackson led No.75 Squadron's five remaining airworthy Kittyhawks to intercept a force of Japanese bombers and their escort. He destroyed an enemy fighter before being shot down and killed. His aircraft hit {{the side of a mountain}} and embedded itself six feet; Jackson was identified only by his size-ten boots and the revolver he habitually wore. His final tally of aerial victories during the war was eight.|$|E
