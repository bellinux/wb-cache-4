50|$|Open-air {{schooling}} {{had been}} experimented with {{around the turn}} of the century in England and Germany, and in the 1910s was promoted in Queensland by Dr Eleanor Bourne, Director of the Department of Public Instruction's <b>School</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> from 1912. A recent study has identified 138 open-air schools constructed in Queensland between 1914 and 1922, with the bulk erected in 1915-16. Approximately 25% of these structures were constructed as annexes to established schools, but most were erected in sparsely settled districts as the only school building. They were comparatively inexpensive to construct, and were considered appropriate in areas unlikely to grow in population, or to transient mining or railway communities. Within a few years, the climatic disadvantages of these open-air schools, particularly those like the Urangan Point School, which had no verandahs, became apparent. When the canvas blinds were drawn against rain or wind, the schoolroom became dark and stuffy, and teaching was almost impossible. The canvas blinds were damaged easily, and required constant attention. They offered no resistance to intruders, and straying or native animals could not be kept out. In the early 1920s, all of the open-air buildings were enclosed with sliding sashes, timber walling and timber doors.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{attempts}} {{to provide a}} detailed account of the process by which medical supervision of the health of school children became established in England and Wales. The analysis focuses primarily on the foundation of the <b>School</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> in 1907 and its subsequent history. Although the <b>School</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> itself is sometimes regarded {{as a consequence of the}} fears about the national condition aroused by the South African War, evidence suggests that the earliest {{attempts to}} monitor the physical condition of school children occurred during the school board era, when the links between health and nutrition and educational performance became apparent. A consequence of the ad hoc development of work in the field of school hygiene during this period was the emergence of a number of political, professional and even personal disputes following the establishment of the <b>School</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service</b> nationally. These meant that uniformity of"standards and of administration had not been achieved by the outbreak of the First World War. Particular difficulties were encountered in London, which is the subject of a special study. Despite these, there was a gradual growth in medical treatment and other non-mandatory services, resulting in the creation of an entirely new agency of treatment; the school clinic. The demands for doctors for military duties in the First World War curtailed some of the work of the <b>School</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service,</b> but treatment facilities continued to expand. After the war, the passage of legislation affecting all aspects of the Service marked the end of the first phase in the creation of a national system of health care for school children. The study concludes by attempting to assess the significance of the establishment of the <b>School</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service,</b> and its impact during the first stage of its development...|$|E

25|$|Another {{government}} plan involved villagization, {{which was}} a response {{not only to the}} famine but also to the poor security situation. Beginning in 1985, peasants were forced to move their homesteads into planned villages, which were clustered around water, <b>schools,</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services,</b> and utility supply points to facilitate distribution of those services. Many peasants fled rather than acquiesce in relocation, which in general proved highly unpopular. Additionally, the government in most cases failed to provide the promised services. Far from benefiting agricultural productivity, the program caused a decline in food production. Although temporarily suspended in 1986, villagization was subsequently resumed.|$|R
50|$|The {{departure}} of the Dutch also caused a massive migration of the rural population into Jakarta, {{in response to a}} perception that the city was the place for economic opportunities.

In 1951 and 1952, 25 hectares of land was opened for housing at Grogol, 25 hectares at Tanah Tinggi (just south of Kemayoran Airport) and 25 hectares at Pejompongan. Another 15 hectares at Pejompongan were set for a water purification plant. The 730 hectare satellite city of Kebayoran Baru, which was conceived by the Dutch in the 1930s, remained the most important housing development in Jakarta in the 1950s.|$|R
40|$|Historians {{who have}} {{examined}} physical education (PE) have rarely related PE to its wider social context. This article considers {{the development of}} PE in elementary schools in England and Wales between 1907 and 1939, and locates PE within the wider history of die <b>School</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service.</b> From 1907, local authorities appointed specialist staff, acquired playing fields, and sent their teachers on short vacation courses, while at a policy level the Chief Medical Officer, Sir George Newman, came to regard PE {{as a component of}} preventive medicine. In the interwar period, PE was greatly influenced by voluntary organizations, and by the physical training schemes set up by the continental dictatorships, and this culminated in the Physical Training and Recreation Act of 1937. However PE also illustrated many of the weaknesses of the <b>School</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service,</b> including striking regional variations in its provisions, and in the 1930 s the emphasis on PE contrasted with the relative neglect of malnutrition. The article concludes by suggesting that the contrast between Sir George Newman's ambitious plans for PE as a branch of preventive medicine, and provision in most local authorities, illustrated the great gulf that could exist between rhetoric and reality...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] PU vir CHODuring 1913 {{arrangements}} {{have been}} made for the hygienic inspection of school children in primary schools, in Transvaal, Dr C. L. Leipoldt was appointed. Medical inspection started in April, 1914, and discontinued, owing to {{the outbreak of the}} war in August, and was resumed in October 1915. In 1918 the scheme of inspection was organized on a sound basis, but was interrupted by the influenza epidemic. In 1919, Dr Leipoldt, was seconded to the Cape, and the service was carried out by Drs Cleaver and Elias. For private reasons, Dr Leipoldt resigned at the end of 1922. Dr J. A. Kieser, joined the service in 1922 and retired at the end of 1948. After various temporary appointments, Dr F. Z. van der Merwe was appointed on the 23 rd of July 1951, and retired on the 10 th of December 1954. Dr c. E. Theron has been appointed as his successor as from January 1955. During 1958 a Commission of Enquiry was appointed to inquire into the efficiency of the <b>school</b> <b>medical</b> <b>service.</b> In 1959, extensions of the service and the provision for more satisfactory accommodation were held in abeyance, awaiting the proposed transfer of the School Medical Services to the Department of Hospital Services.

40|$|Richard Titmuss's classic {{study of}} social policy during the Second World War, Problems of Social Policy, {{published}} in 1950, has exercised an enormous influence on historical accounts of the period. However, recently his interpretation has fallen out of favour with revisionist historians who have argued that he exaggerated {{the extent to which}} the artifical conditions of war provided a permanent basis for the creation of the welfare state in the postwar period, and the degree to which evacuation changed official attitudes to poverty. This article examines to what extent the evacuation of September 1939 led to a reassessment of the earlier achievements of the <b>School</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Service,</b> and how far it illustrated opinion on the reform of welfare services. After briefly tracing planning and the arrival of the evacuees in the reception areas, it considers what the evacuation revealed about the <b>School</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>service</b> and the wider problems of child health in four areas head lice and skin disease, footwear and clothing, nutrition, and child psychology. It concludes that while there was not unanimity on the need for reform, the evacuation did lead to a major reassessment of the effectiveness of health services for schoolchildren and to significant policy changes...|$|E

In specific, the proposed method combines the interchange heuristic for locating facilities and a swapping heuristic for area-type land-use allocation in a multiagent framework.

40|$|In {{this article}} the authors address the {{question}} of why school medical inspection in the Netherlands developed not only considerably slower than the British service but did so also on a more modest scale in terms of the impact on children's lives. In the Netherlands school doctors were not allowed to treat children's illnesses and therefore never opened clinics of their own. Likewise, they did not become part of the school system or even join forces in a national <b>school</b> <b>medical</b> <b>service.</b> To explain this the authors discuss the history of school hygienic concern since the mid-nineteenth century, the respective roles played and arguments provided by the medical and teaching professions in the process of claiming the necessity for school medical inspection, and the conditions that have determined the appointment and instructions of school doctors since 1904. They draw the conclusion that the rapidly growing power of religious groups has limited the expansion of the medical regime. In the Netherlands schoolchildren did not become part of the 'social body' because of national fitness, but because society no longer accepted the inadequacy of the protection of pupils' health against the dangers of schooling, especially after compulsory education was introduced...|$|E

40|$|Land-use {{models are}} a {{well-established}} component of planning support systems to support urban planning for {{and with a}} local community. Existing models are based on either land-suitability analysis or facility-network performance analysis, reflecting two major approaches in modelling for spatial planning—land-use-allocation or land-use-change modelling, and location-allocation modelling. In this study, we propose an agent-based approach to combine methods from both approaches in a single system. We argue and illustrate in a case study that the integrated model is better able to account for a difference in nature between area-type land uses (for example, housing, industry, nature), on the one hand, and facility-type land uses (for example, retailing, <b>schools,</b> <b>medical</b> <b>services),</b> on the other. The model is able to generate a limited set of different land-use-plan alternatives by systematically varying macrocharacteristics of facility networks.
