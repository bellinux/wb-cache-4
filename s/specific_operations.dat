25|$|Professional diving {{operations}} are usually formally planned {{and the plan}} documented as a legal record that due diligence has been done for health and safety purposes. Recreational dive planning may be less formal, but for complex technical dives, can be as formal, detailed and extensive as most professional dive plans. A professional diving contractor will be constrained by the code of practice, standing orders or regulatory legislation covering a project or <b>specific</b> <b>operations</b> within a project, and is responsible for ensuring that {{the scope of work}} to be done is within the scope of the rules relevant to that work. A recreational (including technical) diver or dive group is generally less constrained, but nevertheless is almost always restricted by some legislation, and often also the rules of the organisations to which the divers are affiliated.|$|E

2500|$|On 4 February 1937 Göring invited Raeder to {{a private}} conference which the later accepted. At the meeting, held on 11 March, Raeder handed Göring a {{detailed}} memorandum asking for naval aviation to be seconded, permanently, to the navy {{as it was in}} the best position to understand naval requirements. The results of the conference and conflict were summed up by the Defence Ministry. The supreme commander Werner von Blomberg ordered that aviation units in support of naval operations was the domain of the Luftwaffe but under Kriegsmarine control. It did not resolve the question of which service should be responsible for aerial operations at sea. After the naval staff complained again at the absence of a resolution on 10 March a new conference was organised with Albert Kesselring, Chief of the General Staff, and Göring on 1 April and 10 May with the same result. Göring attacked Blomberg's and Raeder's views and thus decided that air units should only be put at the disposal of the navy during <b>specific</b> <b>operations.</b> Perhaps exasperated and defeated, Raeder noted on 20 May 1937, [...] "Commander in Chief, Navy has decided that the demand of command by the Navy over all Naval Air units shall not be voiced." [...] Raeder noted that Göring did not accept that the navy should have control of air units, and likely never would.|$|E
