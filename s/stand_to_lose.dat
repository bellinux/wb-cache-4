In its {{report on the}} cost of conflict in the Middle East, Strategic Foresight Group estimates that Arab states lost an opportunity to export $10 billion worth of goods to Israel between 2000-2010.

A company will, as a separate person, be the first liable entity for any obligations its directors and employees create on its behalf. If a company {{does not have enough}} assets to pay its debts as they fall due, it will be insolvent - bankrupt. Unless an administrator (someone like an auditing firm partner, usually appointed by creditors on a company's insolvency) is able to rescue the business, shareholders will lose their money, employees will lose their jobs and a liquidator will be appointed to sell off any remaining assets to distribute as much as possible to unpaid creditors. Yet if business remains successful, a company can persist forever, even as the natural people who invest in it and carry out its business change or pass away.|$|E

Aymeric moves to broach diplomatic relations with Dravania, eager to prove man and dragon can coexist peacefully, dispatching his majordomo Lucia to meet with Vidofnir. Meanwhile, the Warrior of Light and Alphinaud resume their search for the other missing Scions, aided by Krile, a Sharlayan scholar who also possesses {{the power of the}} Echo. Tracing reports of a roguish character, the Scions come across another band of adventurers who identify themselves as the Warriors of Darkness. In a brief altercation, Thancred drives off the false heroes. The party returns to Ishgard in riot—an attempt on Aymeric's life sends the city into chaos. The instigators are discovered to be aligned with the Church orthodoxy, who have taken a number of lowborn hostages and demand a conclave to elect a new Archbishop. The Warrior of Light aids the Temple Knights in a raid on the insurgents' stronghold, climaxing when the ringleader tosses a child off the battlements. By providence, Vidofnir arrives to catch her in midair, having agreed to act as Dravanian ambassador, which plants the seeds of hope for peace in the minds of onlookers.|$|E

500|$|Several {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} as to why this specific subject [...] not a very common theme in art history [...] was chosen. One suggestion sees the painting as a justification for the so-called catasto of 1427; {{a new form of}} income tax. This is not a very likely explanation, however, as Brancacci would <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> from the new taxation, and would probably rather have been among its opponents. A more probable explanation links the painting to Pope Martin V's 1423 agreement that the Florentine church be subjected to state tax. The money found in the fish's mouth can also be seen as an expression of how Florence's wealth came from the sea. Felice Brancacci, a silk merchant involved in Mediterranean trade, was {{also a member of the}} city's Board of Maritime Consuls.|$|E
500|$|World War I was {{a turning}} point in Filitti's {{diplomatic}} career. Like many of his fellow Conservatives, and against the lobby which dominated the PNL, he believed in tying Romania to the Central Powers, especially to the German Empire and Austria-Hungary. The Entente Powers alternative, he argued, was bankrupt, because Romania would find herself manipulated by a hostile Russian Empire. His core idea, paraphrased by Georgeta Filitti, was that: [...] "Any entente, any attempt to collaborate, any concession made to [...] would sooner or later turn against us." [...] The diplomat witnessed with alarm that public opinion was against him, either because of seductive Francophilia, or because a war on Austria-Hungary could bring Romania Transylvania region and other irredenta: [...] "The Russian gold has bought off the press and many private persons. Others are guided by sentimentality". In restaurants such as Casa Capșa, [...] "Franco-hysteria and Russo-Frenchitude [...] a peak", and [...] "people of no significance" [...] were even proposing to assassinate the Germanophile King Carol. In this context, he believed, Transylvania could only <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> its character if ever governed from Bucharest.|$|E

500|$|Canadian Senator Douglas Roche, O.C., {{argues in}} The Case for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly that even an {{indirectly}} elected UNPA consisting of delegates appointed by national parliaments could create additional {{checks and balances}} by providing for oversight by a parliamentary body that would be independent of member nations' executive branches. It would open up the global policymaking process to a larger group of elected officials by shifting some power from the relatively small executive branches of countries to the larger legislative branches. According to Roche, globalization has tended to increase {{the power of the}} executive branch while marginalizing the legislative branch; for instance, U.S. Presidents since George H. W. Bush have been given [...] authority to negotiate trade agreements, subject to a [...] "yea or nay" [...] scrutiny by the U.S. Congress on the negotiated deal. A Property and Environment Research Center report argues that changes in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development are another example of how international regulation removes checks and balances between the branches of government: [...] "The OECD was created by a 1961 treaty, ratified by the U.S. Senate, to help achieve economic growth. In April 1998, a ministerial meeting reinterpreted the treaty, adding social and environmental considerations to the economic ones. The United States executive branch agreed to the changes, but the Senate had no opportunity to debate this treaty, even though it was significantly different from the 1961 treaty. The executive branch had essentially negotiated a new deal without Senate approval." [...] World Federalist Canada Briefing Paper No. 30, however, suggests that UNPA proposals may spark opposition from the executive branches that <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> power: [...] "Experience has shown that civil servants and diplomats working in national foreign ministries are less likely to support or see the need for a UNPA. They view the UN as a forum for discussion among sovereign states; whatever action the UN takes is a result of bargaining and compromise among member states".|$|E

Higher-skilled male players, on the other hand, behaved more positively towards female players.

2500|$|The {{authors of}} the 2010 book Merchants of Doubt, provide {{documentation}} for the assertion that professional deniers have tried to sow seeds of doubt in public opinion in order to halt any meaningful social or political progress to reduce the impact of human carbon emissions. The fact that {{only half of the}} American population believe that global warming is caused by human activity could be seen as a victory for these deniers. One of the authors' main arguments is that most prominent scientists who have been voicing opposition to the near-universal consensus are being funded by industries, such as automotive and oil, that <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> money by government actions to regulate greenhouse gases.|$|E

2500|$|Ralea reduced aestheticism {{and social}} {{determinism}} {{to the basic}} units of [...] "aesthetics" [...] and [...] "ethnicity". As he saw it, an ethnic consciousness was biologically and psychologically necessary: it helped structure perception, giving humans a reference point between the particularity and generality. An artist, Ralea argued in 1925, was [...] "obliged" [...] to address the national society he lived in, [...] "at the present stage in civilization": [...] "If he were human, he would be discarding specificity itself, {{that is to say}} the very essence of art, and would fall into science; if he were too specific, too original, he'd <b>stand</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> his means of expression, the point of contact with his public". Ralea believed that the origin of beauty was biological, before being human or social; he also claimed (questionably so, according to art critic Petru Comarnescu) that traditional society allowed no depiction of ugliness before the arrival of Christian art.|$|E
