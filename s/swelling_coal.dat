40|$|The {{increasing}} interest in enhanced coal bed methane (ECBM) production and reporting {{of greenhouse gas}} emissions from mines has spotlighted gas diffusion and gas-induced swelling in coals. Although it is generally agreed that carbon dioxide (CO 2) diffuses faster than methane (CH 4) in coal and that diffusion rates decline as the pressure is increased, there is no general agreement on the physical mechanism responsible. In this paper kinetic data for sorption-induced swelling for five Australian bituminous coals have been analysed. Gases investigated included CO 2 and CH 4, Xe and ethane. It was found that swelling rates are influenced by gas type. CH 4 swelled coal more slowly than CO 2 at the same pressures. Other swelling kinetic data showed that, of the gases investigated, xenon was the slowest, followed by ethane. CO 2 swelling {{was found to be}} the fastest overall. The swelling rate was found to depend on maceral composition, with the slower-swelling coals being vitrinite-rich. However, the swelling rate of different coals varied differently with increasing pressure: the slowest <b>swelling</b> <b>coal</b> showed an increase in swelling rates with an increase in system pressure, whereas the fastest swelling coals showed a decrease in the swelling rates at high pressures.

40|$|AbstractThe {{permeability}} of {{the coal}} seam is the main petrophysical property controlling {{the performance of the}} ECBM operation, since it affects both the CO 2 injection and CH 4 recovery. In the present paper, coal swelling of intact coal samples is studied both under unconstrained and constrained conditions. Unconstrained swelling experiments are performed in a view cell under a static high pressure gas atmosphere, whereas gas injection experiments are carried out in a flow cell, where the sample is subjected to a given hydrostatic confinement. Both experiments are performed by using different gases, namely He, CO 2, CH 4 and N 2, and under typical coal seam conditions, i. e. at high pressure and at 45  ∘C. The results of the unconstrained coal sample showed that swelling increases monotonically with pressure up to a few percents for adsorbing gases, with CO 2 <b>swelling</b> <b>coal</b> more than CH 4 that swells more than N 2, whereas for helium, a non-adsorbing gas, volume changes are negligible. The results of the flow experiments were successfully described using a mathematical model consisting of mass balances accounting for gas flow and adsorption, and mechanical constitutive equations for the description of porosity and permeability changes during injection. Results showed increase in permeability with decreasing effective pressure on the sample. Moreover, when CO 2 is used a permeability reduction was observed compared to Helium, which can be explained by taking into account the effects of swelling on the flow dynamics...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{reservoir}} {{response of}} unmineable coal seams to primary and enhanced natural gas recovery is strongly affected by gas sorption and the swelling {{properties of the}} coal reservoir rock. In-depth understanding {{of the process of}} gas sorption/desorption in the coal matrix, induced deformation and measurement of relevant physical parameters are critical for predictive reservoir management. Models used in industry practice are based on swelling strains measured in “free” <b>swelling</b> <b>coal</b> or on empirical correlations between strain and adsorption, and predict permeability changes based on changes of porosity or stress calculated assuming an analogy with thermoelasticity. However, not only coal seams are subjected to in-situ stresses and geometrical boundary conditions but also sorption and strain are strongly coupled. Representative experiments and a truly coupled model for coal seams are needed in challenging applications. We present a set of triaxial testing measurements on 38 mm diameter fractured sub-bituminous/bituminous coal cores exposed to CO 2. Testing includes the measurement of fluid uptake, adsorption-induced strains and stresses, and the impact on simultaneously measured permeability. Noteworthy, we measured increases in effective stress of up to 29 MPa when injecting CO 2 at 5 MPa and preventing the coal core to swell. The results are analyzed with a poromechanical model in which coal matrix microporosity and adsorption-induced phenomena are embedded into a fractured reservoir rock with transverse isotropic properties. The adsorptive–mechanical coupling in the coal matrix is integrated through an adsorption stress function and fractured coal permeability is estimated as a function of Terzaghi's effective stresses (parallel and perpendicular to the bedding plane). The experimental results and model predictions help identify the characteristic response of coal microporosity and cleat macroporosity on the poromechanical response of coal cores, and suggest that order of magnitude changes of reservoir permeability observed in the field are linked to sorption-induced change on Terzaghi's effective horizontal stress under laterally constrained displacement condition. Together, the modeling and experimental characterization offer unprecedented insights into the mechanics of coal...|$|E

40|$|PhD (Chemical Engineering), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The {{swelling}} and caking propensity of coals may cause operational {{problems such as}} channelling and excessive pressure build-up in combustion, gasification and specifically in fluidised-bed and fixed-bed operations. As a result, the {{swelling and}} caking characteristics of certain coals make them less suitable for use as feedstock in applications where swelling and/or caking is undesired. Therefore, various {{studies have focused on}} the manipulation of the swelling and/or caking propensity of coals, and have proven the viability of using additives to reduce the swelling and caking of powdered coal (< 500 μm). However, there is still a lack of research specifically focused on large coal particle devolatilisation behaviour, particularly swelling and caking, and the reduction thereof using additives. A comprehensive study was therefore proposed to investigate the swelling and caking behaviour of large coal particles (5, 10, and 20 mm) of typical South African coals, and the influence of the selected additive (potassium carbonate) thereon. Three different South African coals were selected based on their Free Swelling Index (FSI) : coal TSH is a high <b>swelling</b> <b>coal</b> (FSI 9) from the Limpopo province, GG is a medium <b>swelling</b> <b>coal</b> (FSI 5. 5 - 6. 5) from the Waterberg region, and TWD is a non-swelling coal (FSI 0) from the Highveld region. Image analysis was used to semi-quantitatively describe the transient swelling and shrinkage behaviour of large coal particles (- 20 + 16 mm) during lowtemperature devolatilisation (700 °C, N 2 atmosphere, 7 K/min). X-ray computed tomography and mercury submersion were used to quantify the degree of swelling of large particles, and were compared to conventional swelling characteristics of powdered coals. The average swelling ratios obtained for TWD, GG, and TSH were respectively 1. 9, 2. 1 and 2. 5 from image analysis and 1. 8, 2. 2 and 2. 5 from mercury submersion. The results showed that coal swelling measurements such as FSI, and other conventional techniques used to describe the plastic behaviour of powdered coal, can in general not be used for the prediction of large coal particle swelling. The large coal particles were impregnated for 24 hours, using an excess 5. 0 M K 2 CO 3 impregnation solution. The influence of K 2 CO 3 -addition on the swelling behaviour of different coal particle sizes was compared, and results showed that the addition of K 2 CO 3 resulted in a reduction in swelling for powdered coal (- 212 μm), as well as large coal particles (5, 10, and 20 mm). For powdered coal, the addition of 10 wt. % K 2 CO 3 decreased the free swelling index of GG and TSH coals from 6. 5 to 0 and from 9. 0 to 4. 5, respectively. The volumetric swelling ratios (SRV) of the 20 mm particles were reduced from 3. 0 to 1. 8 for the GG coal, and from 5. 7 to 1. 4 for TSH. In contrast to the non-swelling (FSI 0) behaviour of the TWD powders, the large particles exhibited average SRV values of 1. 7, and was found not be influenced by K 2 CO 3 -impregnation. It was found that the maximum swelling coefficient, kA, was reduced from 0. 025 to 0. 015 oC- 1 for GG, and from 0. 045 to 0. 027 oC- 1 for TSH, as a results of impregnation. From the results it was concluded that K 2 CO 3 -impregnation reduces the extent of swelling of coals such as GG (medium-swelling) and TSH (high-swelling), which exhibit significant plastic deformation. Results obtained from the caking experiments indicated that K 2 CO 3 -impregnation influenced the physical behaviour of the GG coal particles (5, 10, and 20 mm) the most. The extent of caking of GG was largely reduced due to impregnation, while the wall thickness and porosity also decreased. The coke from the impregnated GG samples had a less fluid-like appearance compared to coke from the raw coal. Bridging neck size measurements were performed, which quantitatively showed a 25 - 50 % decrease in the caking propensity of GG particles. Coal TWD did not exhibit any caking behaviour. The K 2 CO 3 -impregnation did not influence the surface texture or porosity of the TWD char, but increased the overall brittleness of the devolatilised samples. Both the extent of caking and porosity of TSH coke were not influenced by impregnation. However, impregnation resulted in significantly less and smaller opened pores {{on the surface of the}} devolatilised samples, and also reduced the average wall thickness of the TSH coke. The overall conclusion made from this investigation is that K 2 CO 3 (using solution impregnation) can be used to significantly reduce the caking and swelling tendency of large coal particles which exhibits a moderate degree of fluidity, such as GG (Waterberg region). The results obtained during this investigation show the viability of using additive addition to reduce the caking and swelling tendency of large coal particles. Together with further development, this may be a suitable method for modifying the swelling and caking behaviour of specific coals for use in fixed-bed and fluidised-bed gasification operations.

Understanding this swelling behavior is crucial for predicting the performance of future carbon dioxide sequestration operations in unminable coal seams conducted in association with methane production. Swelling is believed to be related to adsorption on the internal coal surface. Whereas it is well established that moisture influences the sorption capacity of coal, the influence of water on <b>coal</b> <b>swelling</b> is less well-defined. This paper presents the results of laboratory experiments to investigate the effect of moisture on <b>coal</b> <b>swelling</b> in the presence of carbon dioxide, methane and argon. Strain development of an unconfined sample of about 1. 0 - 1. 5 mm 3 at 40 °C and 8 MPa (and at other pressures) was observed in an optical cell under a microscope as a function of time. Both air dried and moisturized samples were used. Results confirmed different <b>swelling</b> behaviors of <b>coal</b> with different substances: carbon dioxide leads to higher strain than methane, while exposure to argon leads to very little swelling. The experiments on moisturized samples seem to confirm the role of moisture as a competitor to gas molecules for adsorption sites. Adsorption of water could also explain the observed swelling due to water uptake at atmospheric pressure. A re-introduction of carbon dioxide, after intermediate gas release, results in higher strains which indicate a drying effect of the carbon dioxide on the coal. The results of this study show that the role of water cannot be ignored if one wants to understand the fundamental processes that are taking place in enhanced coalbed methane operations. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|Coal swells when it adsorbs {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2). The {{stress-strain}} behaviour associated with adsorption is of key importance {{in determining the}} feasibility of extracting methane (CH 4) from coal via Enhanced Coalbed Methane production. ECBM involves injection of preferentially sorbing CO 2 into the target coal seam, providing a potential means of geologically storing CO 2, coupled with recovery of desorbing CH 4. However, almost all field experiments performed to date, show major CO 2 injectivity reductions, suggesting that a strong coupling exists between CO 2 sorption, changes in the mechanical state of the coal matrix {{and changes in the}} transport properties of the system. Unfortunately, the fundamental physical processes controlling this coupling are very poorly understood. The present thesis aims at understanding the stress-strain-sorption behaviour of coal matrix material, with the aim to a) better understand ECBM field performance, and b) help advancing existing ECBM reservoir “simulators” towards predictive reservoir models. The approach adopted involves both theoretical developments and mechanical tests (conditions: T= 40 ºC, P= 0 - 100 MPa, σe= 0 - 35 MPa). Several important observations were made. First, the adsorption of CO 2 in the coal matrix gives rise to swelling. The total volumetric strain occurring under unconfined conditions can be realistically modelled as the sum of an adsorption-related expansion term and an elastic compression term. Second, effective in situ stresses in the range 25 - 35 MPa will directly reduce the sorption capacity, and associated <b>swelling,</b> of the <b>coal</b> matrix significantly. A general thermodynamic model for the effect of a 3 -D stress state on adsorbed CO 2 concentration was developed. “Self-stressing”, as a result of CO 2 adsorption occurring under conditions of restricted or zero strain (i. e. fully constrained conditions), will more than double the expected in situ stresses under typical (E) CBM reservoir conditions. A constitutive equation was developed to describe the full coupling between stress state, total strain (i. e. combined strain of adsorption processes and poroelasticity) and sorption. Third, it was observed that microfractures form in coal due to exposure to CO 2 under unconfined conditions. However, in situ stresses will likely prevent opening of such fractures, and will limit equilibration of the coal matrix with CO 2. The findings of this study all lead to the conclusion that CO 2 access to, and CO 2 uptake by the coal matrix remains a major problem for ECBM operations, {{especially in the case of}} stiff, highly <b>swelling</b> <b>coals</b> situated at (unmineable) depth. Major improvements in access to the coal matrix by CO 2 can probably only be achieved by creating space to accommodate <b>coal</b> <b>swelling.</b> The required removal of coal mass, or creation of void volume, may be achievable either by hydrofracturing and injection of solvents to remove either organic or mineral components, by performing active mining of the coal and/or the over- or underlying strata, or possibly by pore pressure depletion of porous sediments enclosing the target coal seams...|$|R

However, accurate measurement of <b>coal</b> <b>swelling</b> due to water sorption presents a substantial challenge, because while measurement accuracy increases with sample size, so does equilibration time hence experiment duration. This paper reports dilatometry experiments conducted on 1 and 4 mm sized cubic samples of Brzeszcze high volatile bituminous coal. These were performed using a purpose-build, 3 -dimensional (3 D) dilatometer, consisting of sensitive eddy-current gap sensors. The {{aim was to}} accurately and continuously measure the volumetric response of coal matrix material during exposure to water vapour at relative humidities varied {{in the range of}} 0. 1 to 95 %, at a temperature of 40 °C. Our results show that the swelling strains attained at apparent equilibrium tend to be a factor of up to 1. 45 higher perpendicular to bedding than in the bedding plane. In addition, the sample size strongly influences the swelling kinetics, but does not influence the equilibrium swelling strains. Moreover, the volumetric swelling strains attained at equilibrium show a near-linear dependence on relative humidity, reaching 1. 37 – 1. 43 % at around 95 % relative humidity. In an attempt to explain the observed behaviour, three models for <b>swelling</b> of unconfined <b>coal</b> matrix material due to water sorption were developed. These correspond to mono-layer adsorption, multiple-layer sorption, and combined mono plus multiple-layer sorption. The experimental data are equally well fitted by all three models, so that the mechanism responsible for swelling could not be uniquely identified.

40|$|We {{construct}} {{theoretical models}} for time-dependent <b>swelling</b> of <b>coal</b> matrix material upon adsorption {{of a single}} gas, taking into account a coupling between stress, strain, chemical potential, and diffusion. Two models are developed. The first (model A) corresponds to diffusion and hence swelling rates being controlled by the jump frequency of adsorbed molecules between closely spaced adsorption sites and the second (model B) to transport controlled by diffusion of unadsorbed molecules through diffusion paths linking distant adsorption sites. To test these models, we performed axial swelling experiments on a single 4 mm sized cylindrical sample of medium volatile bituminous coal, exposed to CH 4 at pressures up to 40 MPa, at 40 °C, using 1 -D, high-pressure dilatometry. The models were calibrated to the experimental data by adjustment of a single-valued diffusion coefficient, independent of gas pressure and adsorbed concentration. The {{results show that the}} data can be accurately explained only by model B. The implication is that the gas transport, the associated adsorption, and hence time-dependent swelling are controlled by the diffusion of unadsorbed molecules and not by molecules jumping between the adjacent adsorption sites. Our model describes a full coupling between stress, strain, sorption, and diffusion in coal matrix material in terms of parameters that have clear physical meaning and are easily obtained from sorption and <b>swelling</b> experiments on <b>coal</b> of any rank exposed to any gas.

40|$|International audienceCoal seams are {{naturally}} filled with natural gas. Enhanced Coal Bed Methane recovery (ECBM) {{is a technique}} which consists in injecting carbon dioxide (CO 2) in coal seams {{in order to enhance}} the recovery of the methane (CH 4) present in the coal seams. A major issue for the industrial development of this technique is the loss of permeability of the reservoirs during injection. In a coal bed, most of the transport of fluids occurs in a network of natural frac- tures. The loss of permeability is attributed to the closure of the fractures induced by the <b>swelling</b> of the <b>coal</b> ma- trix during the progressive replacement of CH 4 by CO 2. Since both fluids are mostly adsorbed in the microporous matrix of coal, this particular problem raises the funda- mental question of how adsorption impacts the mechanics of a microporous solid.

40|$|International audienceAn {{injection}} {{of carbon dioxide}} into a coal bed methane reservoir facilitates the recovery of methane, {{a process known as}} enhanced coal bed methane recovery (ECBM). The injected carbon dioxide can then remain stored for geological periods of time. Over the process carbon dioxide gets adsorbed at the surface of the coal pores, which causes the coal to swell. In confined conditions this swelling leads to a closure of the coal reservoir cleat (fracture) system. Since permeability in coal beds is mostly driven by this cleat system, CO 2 -induced swelling hinders further injection and impairs the economic viability of ECBM. In this work we provide a comprehensive framework to calculate the macroscopic strains induced by adsorption in a porous medium, starting from the molecular level. Using a thermodynamic approach we extend the realm of poromechanics to surface energy and surface stress. This approach enables to calculate the macroscopic strains induced by a change of surface stress at the interface between solid matrix and pore space. The calculations performed are valid for a general microstructure. The microstructural features are identified which govern the mechanical response of the porous medium to a change of surface stress. We then focus on how surface stress depends on adsorption. We employ molecular simulations to estimate adsorption isotherms in both micropores (below 2 nm) and mesopores (above 2 nm). A comparison of our molecular simulation results with experimental results of <b>coal</b> <b>swelling</b> shows that adsorption in micropores (below 2 nm) plays a primordial role in the CO 2 -induced <b>swelling</b> of <b>coal.</b> The developed framework is here applied to the specific case of the swelling of CO 2 -injected coal although it is relevant to any problem in which adsorption in a porous medium causes strains...|$|R

Briquette weathering (i. e. swelling and disintegration of briquettes when exposed to variations in humidity and temperature) was examined by making alterations to briquette feed material and observing the effects on swelling in water. The application of solubility parameter alone to prediction of <b>coal</b> <b>swelling</b> was rejected due to the many exceptions to any proposed trend. Brown <b>coal</b> <b>swelling</b> showed a minimum when the solvent electron-donor number (DN) minus its electron-acceptor number (AN) was closest to zero, i. e. when DN and AN were of similar magnitude. The degree of swelling increased either side of this point, as predicted by theory. In contrast to the solubility parameter approach (which suffers from the uncertainty caused by specific interaction between coal and solvent), the electron donor/acceptor approach is about specific interactions. It was concluded that a combination of total and three-dimensional solubility parameters and solvent electron donor/acceptor numbers may be used to predict solvent swelling of unextracted brown coals with some success. Solvent access to chemically densified coal was found to be insensitive to a reduction in pore volume, and chemical effects were dominant. Thermal modification of the digested coal resulted in reduced swelling for all solvents, indicating that the structure had adopted a minimum energy configuration due to decarboxylation and replacement of hydrogen bonds with additional covalent bonds. <b>Swelling</b> of oxygen-alkylated <b>coals</b> demonstrated that the more polar solvents are able to break relatively weak hydrogen bonded crosslinks. The large difference between the rate and extent of swelling in water (and hence weathering) of Yallourn and Morwell briquettes was shown to be almost entirely attributable to exchanged magnesium. Magnesium exchange significantly increases the rate and extent of <b>swelling</b> of Yallourn <b>coal.</b> It was also shown that the swelling of briquettes due to uptake of water by magnesium-exchanged coals is reduced significantly with controlled ageing of the briquettes. The solvent swelling behaviour of Victorian brown coals is consistent with the notion that coal is a both covalently and non-covalently crosslinked and entangled macromolecular network comprising extractable species, which are held within the network by a wide range of non-covalent, polar, electron donor/acceptor interactions. Solvents capable of significant extraction of whole brown coals are also capable of significant swelling, but not dissolution, of the macromolecular coal network, which supports the view that the network is comprised of both covalent and ionic bonding. Victorian brown coals have also been shown to exhibit polyelectrolytic behaviour due to a high concentration of ionisable surface functionalities...|$|R

COALSWAD (www. coalswad. eu) deals with the storage of CO 2 in coal seams. Our project is focussed on a comprehensive investigation of the adsorption behaviour of coal taking into consideration the influence of <b>swelling</b> behaviour. <b>Coal</b> samples of comparable rank but different source (Germany, Czech Republic and Spain) are examined. All samples are dried at 353 K for 36 h under vacuum before the gravimetric adsorption measurements with He, CO 2, CH 4 and H 2 O at 313 K are started. These adsorption data {{are influenced by the}} swelling process occurring in coal, because possibly volume changes influence the buoyancy of the sample. Therefore it is essential to get detailed knowledge of swelling behaviour. By using SAXS- and NMR-techniques a detailed picture of structural changes in coal structure is gained. Results received show that with increasing coalification grade the degree of swelling decreases and the CO 2 adsorption capacity increases...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a comprehensive {{investigation into the}} underlying coupled processes in coal in response to high pressure gas injection. This is achieved by i) developing a new high pressure gas experimental facility and conducting a series of experimental tests, and ii) developing and applying a theoretical and numerical model. A novel experimental facility was designed, which offers stable and continuous high-pressure injection of gases in fractured rocks, for detailed study of the reactive transport processes. It consists of the gas supply and backpressure control system. Using the newly developed experimental facility, the response of coal subject to subcritical and supercritical gas injection under stable and variable temperature conditions was studied. The experimental investigation consisted {{of a series of}} tests: i) sorption capacity and kinetics tests, ii) uniaxial compressive tests, iii) sieve analysis tests, iv) flow and deformation tests. Thirty anthracite coal samples from different depths (i. e. 150 m and 550 m) and locations from the South Wales coalfield were characterised and tested. The capabilities of the theoretical and numerical modelling platform of thermal, hydraulic, chemical and mechanical processes were advanced. A new theoretical approach was adopted which successfully incorporates reactive gas transport coupled with coal deformation. The development of constitutive relationships describing the sorption induced elastic isotropic <b>swelling</b> of <b>coal</b> and changes in permeability was considered in detail. Numerical solutions of the governing flow and deformation equations were achieved by employing the finite element method for spatial discretisation and the finite difference method for temporal discretisation. The new model was verified for its accuracy via a series of benchmark tests and validated using high-resolution experimental data. The results of the experimental study showed that the sorption capacity and kinetics are sample-size dependent, particularly for deeper coal. Higher and faster sorption of CO 2 obtained on powdered samples compared to intact samples indicated that sorption processes are governed by fracture interconnectivity and accessibility of pores. Sorption of CO 2 was found to significantly reduce the brittleness, uniaxial compressive strength and elastic modulus of anthracite coals. The results of the post-failure sieve analysis showed that CO 2 saturated samples disintegrated on smaller particles than non-saturated samples indicating that sorption induced <b>swelling</b> weakens the <b>coal</b> structure by enhancing the existing and inducing new fractures. During CO 2 flow through coal under constant stress, samples experienced swelling resulting in initial reduction followed by recovery of measured flow rates. CO 2 sorption induced changes were found to be non-reversible. The results of high CO 2 flow through coal showed that CO 2 reduced the temperature of the system, associated with Joule- Thomson cooling, enhancing the <b>coal</b> <b>swelling</b> and opposite to expected, increasing the flow rates. Overall, the high-resolution data-set obtained is a significant contribution to the scientific community and is able to provide a means of validation for future models. The results of the verification and validation exercises demonstrated the capability of the developed model to simulate coupled processes involved in gas transport in coal. A series of numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the permeability evolution and CO 2 breakthrough in coal subject to supercritical CO 2 injection using the developed model. Different scenarios were considered, involving a range of values of the elastic modulus and the parameter defining the <b>coal</b> <b>swelling.</b> The results of the advanced numerical simulations showed that the effect of CO 2 sorption induced swelling on permeability reduces with a decrease in coal stiffness suggesting that CO 2 sorption induced reduction of elastic modulus would {{have a positive effect on}} the ability of coal to conduct CO 2. In this work, confidence in the feasibility of CO 2 storage in anthracite coals was improved by enhancing the knowledge of high pressure gas-coal interactions through both experimental and numerical investigations. Moreover, it is claimed that newly developed model enables predictions of coupled processes involved in carbon sequestration in coal...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{impact of}} coal pore {{structure}} on adsorption-induced matrix <b>swelling</b> of three <b>coals</b> of different ranks was investigated experimentally. The swelling strain measurements for the selected {{samples of the}} two higher rank coals suggested that variation in the sample pore size distribution, particularly the microporosity, has a larger impact on matrix swelling induced by adsorption of CO 2 than by adsorption of less adsorbing gases. The swelling behaviour recorded for the low rank coal {{may be explained by}} the level of microporosity or lack of it. From flue gas ECBM point of view, the swelling strain data tentatively suggests that the low rank coal would experience less swelling, compared to the higher rank coals...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{consider}} the spatial homogenization of a coupled transport and fluid-structure interaction model, {{to the end of}} deriving a system of effective equations describing the flow, elastic deformation, and transport in an active poroelastic medium. The `active' nature of the material results from a morphoelastic response to a chemical stimulant, in which the growth timescale is strongly separated from other elastic timescales. The resulting effective model is broadly relevant to the study of biological tissue growth, geophysical flows (e. g. <b>swelling</b> in <b>coals</b> and clays) and a wide range of industrial applications (e. g. absorbant hygiene products). The key contribution of this work is the derivation of a system of homogenized partial differential equations describing macroscale growth, coupled to transport of solute, that explicitly incorporates details of the structure and dynamics of the microscopic system, and, moreover, admits finite growth and deformation at the pore-scale. The resulting macroscale model comprises a Biot-type system, augmented with additional terms pertaining to growth, coupled to an advection-reaction-diffusion equation. The resultant system of effective equations is then compared to other recent models under a selection of appropriate simplifying asymptotic limits...|$|R
40|$|To {{gauge the}} {{potential}} of seismic methods for the estimation of gas content in coal, the ultrasonic response of a sample saturated in turn with He, N 2, CH 4, and CO 2 has been investigated. Specifically, traveltimes {{were used to determine}} P-wave velocity {{as a function of the}} difference between confining pressure and pore pressure. After crushing the sample to powder, adsorption isotherms for CO 2 and CH 4 were measured and then used to estimate the bulk densities, P-wave moduli, and impedances during the traveltime measurements. The data suggest a significant difference in density, P-wave modulus, and impedance under CO 2 relative to CH 4 saturation. Though these findings are based on the assumption that adsorption capacity of the sample when confined was similar to that measured after crushing, they are also roughly supported by isostatic strain measurements taken during swelling. Two possible causes of this behavior are, first, the mechanical properties of the adsorbed phase may be more liquid than gaslike. Second, the <b>swelling</b> of <b>coal</b> under confining pressure should lead to the closure of soft pores, thus stiffening the frame...|$|R

The project began in 2003 and {{was completed in}} 2010. This demonstration project planned to test horizontal drilling for carbon storage with ECBM recovery. Horizontal drilling will maximize drainage of CBM and minimize the surface footprint of the injection operation. Horizontal drilling may also limit the negative impacts of <b>coal</b> <b>swelling</b> that might limit injectivity of a single, vertical well. As much as 20, 000 tons of CO 2 would be injected over the two-year period, or until CO 2 breaks through to the production well (Greb et al. 2010). No report about the final injection quantity was found.|$|R
40|$|Liquefaction {{experiments}} {{have been performed}} on two Colombian coals under high pressure nitrogen atmospheres {{in the presence of}} ethanol and a catalyst of ZnCl 2. It was observed that the production of products soluble in toluene and THF increased with reaction temperature and nitrogen pressure. The addition of a partial pressure of 10 % hydrogen also increased yields although further increases in hydrogen pressure had no effect. It was observed that ethanol swelled both coals significantly and it was believed that the swelling increased the accessibility of the ethanol and catalyst to the macromolecular structure thus creating a very efficient hydrogenation system. The efficiency of the system was attributed to dissolution of the catalyst in the ethanol and <b>swelling</b> of the <b>coal</b> macromolecular structure...|$|R
40|$|International audiencePoromechanics {{offers a}} {{consistent}} theoretical framework for describing the mechanical response of porous solids. When dealing with fully saturated nanoporous materials, which exhibit pores of the nanometer size, additional effects due to adsorption and confinement of the fluid molecules {{in the smallest}} pores must be accounted for. From the mechanical point of view, these phenomena result into volumetric deformations of the porous solid, the so-called "swelling" phenomenon, and into a change of the apparent permeability. The present work investigates how poromechanics may be refined in order to capture adsorption and molecular-packing-induced effects in nanoporous solids. The revisited formulation introduces an effective pore pressure, defined as a thermodynamic variable at the representative volume element scale (mesoscale), which {{is related to the}} mechanical work of the fluid at the pore scale (nanoscale). Accounting for the thermodynamic equilibrium of the system, this effective pore pressure is obtained {{as a function of the}} bulk fluid pressure, the temperature, and the total and excess adsorbed masses of fluid. We derive the analytical swelling strains due to sorption and molecular packing. A good agreement in the comparison with experimental data dealing with the <b>swelling</b> of <b>coal</b> due to methane and carbon dioxide sorption is observed, as a preliminary stage toward modeling partially saturated solids and applications to cement paste...|$|R
40|$|Coal {{permeability}} models {{based on}} constrained {{conditions such as}} constant volume theory can successfully match unconstrained experimental data and field observations. However, these models have a boundary mismatch because the boundary of permeability models is constrained while experiment boundary is free displacement or unconstrained. What the mechanism is to require such a boundary mismatch has not been well understood. In this study, a full coupled approach was developed to explicitly simulate the interactions of coal matrixes and fractures. In this model, a matrix-fracture model is numerically investigated after incorporating heterogeneous distributions of Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus, Langmuir strain constant {{in the vicinity of}} the fracture. The impact of these local heterogeneities of <b>coal</b> mechanical and <b>swelling</b> properties on the permeability evolution is explored. The transient permeability evolution during gas swelling process is investigated and the difference between the final equilibrium permeability and transient permeability is compared. With the heterogeneity assumption, a net reduction of coal permeability is achieved from the initial no-swelling state to the final equilibrium state. This net reduction of coal permeability increases with the fracture (injection) pressure and is in good agreement with laboratorial data under the unconstrained <b>swelling</b> conditions. <b>Coal</b> local heterogeneity in vicinity of fracture can therefore be the mechanism of the above mismatch...|$|R
40|$|Permeability {{evolution}} in coal seams during CO 2 -Enhanced Coalbed Methane (ECBM) production is {{strongly influenced by}} swelling/shrinkage effects related to sorption and desorption of both CO 2 and CH 4. Other gases, such as N 2, have also been proposed for injection in ECBM operations. In addition, water vapour will almost always be naturally present. Much {{work has been done}} on the sorption/swelling response of coal exposed to pure gases. However, to address in-situ coal-seam conditions realistically, an understanding of the <b>swelling</b> behaviour of <b>coal</b> matrix material due to multiple-species adsorption is needed. Here, we construct new thermodynamic models for <b>swelling</b> of unconfined <b>coal</b> due to adsorption of multiple gas/fluid species, addressing the equilibrium state and focusing on a binary gas mixture. Four models are derived, covering three possible end-member interactions, plus a generalized case. The end-member models considered correspond to adsorption of gases α and β at fully separate sites, at fully shared sites and at partially shared sites (Models 1 – 3, respectively). We compare our model predictions with literature data on the swelling behaviour of Bowen Basin coal exposed to CH 4 /CO 2 mixtures at total pressures up to 15 MPa and at 55 °C. The results show that swelling of the Bowen Basin coal exposed to CO 2 /CH 4 mixtures is best explained by Model 3, which in turn implies that adsorption and swelling is in this case determined by both partial pressure and selective adsorption (affinity) effects. Model 3 is easy to parameterize and its applicability to specific coals and gas mixtures is easily evaluated. Though more difficult to parameterize, our generalized swelling model (Model 4) can be applied to any coal rank, and to any binary gas mixture. It therefore offers an important tool for modeling swelling and permeability evolution during ECBM operations...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{influence}} of cross couplings between coal deformation, gas flow and thermal transport has been widely recognized, their impacts {{on the evolution of}} coal permeability are still not well understood. CO 2 may be injected at - 40 °C, 60 °C lower than that of the targeted coal seams for sequestration. Under these injection conditions, coal matrix may swell due to the thermal expansion and shrink due to the change in adsorption capacity. This uncertainty of swelling/shrinking complicates the prediction of coal permeability. In this study, a fully coupled coal deformation, gas flow and transport, and thermal transport model is developed to evaluate the complex evolution of coal permeability under the combined influence of variable gas pressure and temperature. These combined effects are evaluated through explicit simulations of the dynamic interactions between coal matrix swelling/shrinking and fracture aperture alteration, and translations of these interactions to the evolution of coal permeability. The fully coupled model is applied to evaluate why coal permeability changes instantaneously from reduction to enhancement under the free swelling condition as widely reported in the literature. Our results have revealed the transition of <b>coal</b> matrix <b>swelling</b> from local swelling to macro-swelling as a novel mechanism for the simultaneous switching of coal permeability from the initial reduction to the late recovery. At the initial stage of CO 2 injection under variable temperatures, matrix swelling due to gas sorption, thermal expansion and the change in adsorption capacity is localized within the vicinity of the fracture compartment. As the injection continues, the swelling zone is widening further into the matrix and the swelling becomes macro-swelling. When the <b>swelling</b> is localized, <b>coal</b> permeability is controlled by the internal fracture boundary condition and behaves volumetrically; when the <b>swelling</b> becomes macro-swelling, <b>coal</b> permeability is controlled by the external boundary condition...|$|R
