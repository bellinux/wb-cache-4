5|$|Hill's {{entered his}} first drag race at the Flying Fish Lodge in Karnack, Texas in 1955. Hill drove his home-built hot rod {{to the track}} and won the event. The hot rod had a Model T frame and an Oldsmobile V8 engine. In 1958, he built his second dragster using parts that his {{employer}} allowed him to scavenge {{while working as a}} <b>sales</b> <b>engineer</b> at a foundry in Wichita Falls, Texas. He used the dragster to set the Texas state low elapsed time (e.t.) that year with a 9.93-second pass. The following year, Hill won the state championship with a 9.25-second pass at 161miles per hour (259kilometers per hour). Hill won his first national event in 1959 in a Hot Gas race at an American Hot Rod Association (AHRA) national championship event in Great Bend, Kansas. Hill earned $500 for an appearance at Inyokern, California to race Jack Chrisman and his Sidewinder dragster. One of his four passes in the 1960 event set the B/Gas dragster record at 163.04mph (262.39km/h), so Hill quit his job to become a full-time drag racer. Later that season he set the a new A/Gas low e.t. at 8.84seconds and set the speed record in the class at 161.29mph (259.57km/h).|$|E

40|$|Today {{much of a}} company’s {{competitive}} edge lies in the knowledge and competence found within the company. Technology and products are becoming increasingly complex meaning that the way knowledge is created and managed is extremely important. The Reactor Technology department at Alfa Laval launched the first of their continuous flow microreactors: ART ® Plate Reactors in 2007. The product differs from other more well-known Alfa Laval products, and <b>sales</b> <b>engineers</b> have the task of promoting and selling these reactors to customers around the world. How can <b>sales</b> <b>engineers</b> gain the knowledge and competence necessary for promoting and selling the reactors? What challenges exist and what additional sales and marketing tools are required for this task? A literature study of microreactors, knowledge management and adult learning was conducted. Furthermore semi-structured interviews with Alfa Laval staff, <b>sales</b> <b>engineers</b> and customers were carried out to identify existing needs and {{what was expected of}} the <b>sales</b> <b>engineers.</b> The role of the <b>sales</b> <b>engineers</b> was described as presenting and promoting the product to the customer, answering initial customer questions and being able to identify if a customer process is applicable to the plate reactors.

50|$|A key {{differentiator}} between sales {{engineers and}} other roles {{within the organization}} is that a <b>sales</b> <b>engineer</b> is usually compensated by salary plus commission, as most sales representatives are. This commission is usually paid out when the sales representative is paid. Far less common is the case where a <b>sales</b> <b>engineer</b> is compensated with a base salary plus bonus. The bonus can be based upon the revenue generated within an assigned territory, set up as a Management By Objective (MBO) bonus, {{or a combination of}} the two. In both cases a <b>sales</b> <b>engineer</b> will make a base salary that is proportionally higher than their sales representative counterparts, and significantly more than the traditional engineers in an organization.|$|E
