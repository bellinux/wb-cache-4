As measured by the Paper Folding Test (of the Factor- Referenced Cognitive Tests) and the Space Relations Test (of the Differential Aptitude Test), these five students had average- to above-average visualization skills. The researcher worked individually with the students {{for three to four}} 50 - minute sessions regarding finding volumes <b>of</b> <b>solids</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution.</b> Physical models were used and visual explanations were stressed during the instructional interactions. Initially, the students? selections of the methods for finding the volumes were based on their images <b>of</b> the whole <b>solids</b> rather than on the slices needed for the models which the specific calculus methods required. Various geometric and algebraic misconceptions which prevented the students from consistently setting up correct volume integrals were identified. After instruction, the visualization of the five students improved and they began to form images of the appropriate slicing necessary for each particular method in order to find the volumes <b>of</b> the <b>solids</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution.</b> Students also improved their ability to express the geometric situations algebraically, but misconceptions remained.

However, existing approaches either cannot identify all UFPDs or cannot run at interactive speeds (the best exhaustive algorithm, unimplemented, runs at O(n 4) time theoretically). Our proposed feature-based approach avoids testing the whole Gaussian sphere of potential directions by first efficiently identify all UFPDs for individual {{features such as}} extruded and revolved features, thus significantly reducing test space and running time. In this paper, we describe a fast algorithm to find all UFPDs for <b>solids</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution.</b> The algorithm is based on analyzing the constructing 2 D generator profiles, building on our previous results for 2 -moldability analysis of polygons. The running time is O(n), where n is the geometric complexity of the 2 D generator profile. For parts containing multiple <b>solids</b> <b>of</b> <b>revolution,</b> the set <b>of</b> possible UFPDs can be significantly reduced based upon an analysis of each such feature, efficiently identifying many as non- 2 -moldable or reducing the search space for exhaustive algorithms that find all UFPDs. ...|$|R
