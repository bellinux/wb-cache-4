50|$|The Interpretive Theory of Translation (ITT) is {{a concept}} {{from the field of}} Translation Studies. It was {{established}} in the 1970s by Danica Seleskovitch, a French translation scholar and former Head of the Paris <b>School</b> <b>of</b> <b>Interpreters</b> and Translators (Ecole Supérieure d’Interprètes et de Traducteurs (ESIT), Université Paris 3 - Sorbonne Nouvelle). A conference interpreter herself, Seleskovitch challenged the view prevailing at the time that translation {{was no more than a}} linguistic activity, one language being merely transcoded into another. She described translation as a triangular process: from one language to sense and from sense to the other language. She coined the name Interpretive Theory of Translation and, even before Translation Studies became a field in its own right, introduced the process of translation into the vast area of cognitive research. In order to verify the first observations made as a practitioner, Seleskovitch went on to write a doctoral thesis. Soon, a handful of conference interpreters interested in research joined her at ESIT.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} two exegetical traditions, {{that of the}} early Jewish and the patristic schools. The research work for this project urges the need to analyze both Jewish and Patristic literature in which specific types of hermeneutics are found. The title of the thesis (“compared study of patristic and Jewish exegesis”) indicates the goal and {{the scope of this}} study. These two different hermeneutical approaches from a specific period of time will be compared with each other illustrated by their interpretation of the book of Ruth. The thesis discusses how the process of interpretation was affected by the interpreters’ society in which they lived. This work in turn shows the relationship between the cultural variants of the exegetes and the biblical interpretation. Both methodologies represented by Jewish and patristic exegesis were applicable and social relevant. They maintained the interest of community and fulfilled the need of their generation. Referring to early Jewish exegesis, the interpretations upheld the position of Ruth as a heir of the Davidic dynasty. They advocated the importance of Boaz’s and Ruth’s virtue as a good illustration of morality in Judaism. Early Christian exegetes were also interested in the basic values of the social community. They maintained the important social value of marriage {{as an example of the}} emphasis on virtue. They also paid much emphasis on teaching morality. Concerning the doctrine and value of Judaism, the sage upheld the principle of monotheism and the legitimacy of Davidic dynasty. In turn, patristic fathers urged for the introduction of the gospel through the salvation of Jesus Christ in the process of interpretation. From our investigation, we can formulate the thesis that both early Jewish and Christian exegetes did not explain the text for its inherent meaning, but rather used the text for their own purposes. Normally, the main task and mission of an exegete should be to find the meaning inherent in the text. We clearly indicated that both exegetical <b>schools</b> <b>of</b> <b>interpreters</b> did not find meaning in the text of the book of Ruth, but rather read in some agendas and issues into the text from outside, from the exegetes themselves and their surrounding backgrounds. They tend to meet the requirement of the social and political expectations of their reader community. Interpretation was used as a tool for this purpose. They conducted an application rather than explanation. This thesis can be explained by the fact that the meaning of a text depends on the value and pre-set agenda of the exegete who interprets it. Both the text and its <b>interpreters</b> are part <b>of</b> a specific historical, political, social and cultural environment, which imposed influence on them.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Arabic-speaking {{migrants}} have {{constituted a}} growing population in recent years. This entails major challenges to ensure good {{communication in the}} healthcare encounter {{in order to provide}} individual and holistic healthcare. One of the solutions to ensure good communication between patient and healthcare staff who do not share the same language is to use a professional interpreter. To our knowledge, no previous qualitative studies have been found concerning Arabic-speaking migrants and the use <b>of</b> <b>interpreters.</b> This study aims to ascertain their individual experiences which can help extend our understanding of the studied area. METHOD: A purposive sample of 13 Arabic-speaking persons with experience <b>of</b> using <b>interpreters</b> in healthcare encounters. Data were collected between November 2012 and March 2013 by four focus-group interviews and analysed with qualitative analysis according to a method described for focus groups. RESULTS: Four categories appeared from the analysis: 1) The professional interpreter as spokesperson; 2) Different types <b>of</b> <b>interpreters</b> and modes <b>of</b> interpretation adapting to the healthcare encounter; 3) The professional interpreter's task and personal properties affected the use <b>of</b> professional <b>interpreters</b> in a healthcare encounter; 4) Future planning of the use <b>of</b> professional <b>interpreters</b> in a healthcare encounter. The main findings were that the use <b>of</b> <b>interpreters</b> was experienced both as a possibility and as a problem. The preferred type <b>of</b> <b>interpreters</b> depended on the interpreter's dialect and ability to interpret correctly. Besides the professional <b>interpreter's</b> qualities <b>of</b> good skill in language and medical terminology, translation ability, neutrality and objectivity, Arabic-speaking participants stated that professional interpreters need to share the same origin, religion, dialect, gender and political views as the patient in order to facilitate the interpreter use and avoid inappropriate treatment. CONCLUSION: The study showed that the personal qualities <b>of</b> a good <b>interpreter</b> not only cover language ability but also origin, religion, dialect, gender and political views. Thus, there is need to develop strategies for personalized healthcare in order to avoid inappropriate communication, to satisfy the preferences of the person in need <b>of</b> <b>interpreters</b> and improve the impact of interpretation on the quality of healthcare...|$|R
