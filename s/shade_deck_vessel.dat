Lift netters range from open boats about 10 metres long to larger vessels with open ocean capability. <b>Decked</b> <b>vessels</b> usually have the bridge amidships. Larger vessels are often equipped with winches and derricks for handling the lifting lines, as well as outriggers and light booms.

50|$|Monroe, when {{delivered}} {{the largest of}} the line's ships, was a hurricane deck type steel screw steamer rigged as a two masted schooner with steel construction to the hurricane deck and wood superstructure and deck houses and built to the American Bureau of Shipping standards for coastwise vessels. Key specifications were 366 ft length overall, 344 ft length between perpendiculars, 46 ft molded beam, 37 ft depth to hurricane deck at lowest point of sheer, 5,375 ton displacement at draft of 18 ft, four steel bladed propeller of 17 ft diameter.

From uppermost, all <b>decks</b> were <b>shade</b> <b>deck,</b> hurricane deck, main deck, lower deck and orlop deck. Frames, continuous from keel to hurricane deck were at 26 in spacing from stem to the over-all hatch and then alternate from keel to main deck or the hurricane deck with double frames at five water tight bulkheads dividing the ship into four water tight compartments. Heavier plating covered the frames forward of the collision bulkhead. Steel decks were covered by yellow pine, 3.75 in thick on the main deck, with the hurricane deck was pine aft to passenger accommodations and from there aft in canvased white pine.|$|R
25|$|Trap setters – {{are used}} to set pots or traps for {{catching}} fish, crabs, lobsters, crayfish and other similar species. Trap setters {{range in size from}} open boats operating inshore to larger decked vessels, 20 to 50 metres long, operating out {{to the edge of the}} continental shelf. Small decked trap setters have the wheelhouse either forward or aft with the fish hold amidships. They use hydraulic or mechanical pot haulers. Larger vessels have the wheelhouse forward, and are equipped with derricks, davits or cranes for hauling pots aboard. Locating fish is often more a matter of the fishermen's knowledge of the fishing grounds rather than the use of special detection equipment. <b>Decked</b> <b>vessels</b> are usually equipped with an echosounder, and large vessels may also have a Loran or GPS.|$|R
