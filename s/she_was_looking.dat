5|$|Pfeiffer {{chose to}} begin the process of {{dissolving}} her film production company, Via Rosa Productions, in 1999, and move into semi-retirement in order to spend more quality time with her children and family, meaning that she would continue to star in films sporadically into the 2000s and beyond. Pfeiffer handed her producing partner Guinzburg one final film to produce under the Via Rosa Productions header. The film was called, Original Sin (2001). It was originally intended to star Pfeiffer, who later changed her mind as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> to work less for a while. The film was produced by her company, but instead starred Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas.|$|E
5|$|Pound {{was fascinated}} by the {{translations}} of Japanese poetry and Noh plays which he discovered in the papers of Ernest Fenollosa, an American professor who had taught in Japan.

Pound edited and published Fenellosa's The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry in 1918.|$|E

25|$|The {{ultralight}} sequence {{was difficult}} to shoot, requiring intense coordination and actors Tim Robbins and Ed Gale to actually fly the plane.

25|$|On {{the same}} cliff path where Nofret and Satipy died, Renisenb, {{apparently}} summoned by Hori, hears footsteps {{behind her and}} turns to see Yahmose. She then sees the look of murderous hatred in her brother's eyes that the other women saw before they were killed. On the brink of her own death, she realises that Satipy was not looking in fear at anything beyond Yahmose — <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> straight at him. He had consumed a non-lethal dose of poison and pretended to recuperate while committing murders, both to make himself chief heir and to indulge his newfound love of violence. As Renisenb realises some of this, Hori slays Yahmose with an arrow and saves her. Hori explains all. Renisenb's final choice is whom to marry: Kameni, a lively husband not unlike her first, or Hori, an older and more enigmatic figure. She makes her choice and falls into Hori’s arms.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 17 July 2008, a woman was {{approached}} by Ghazni Province police officers {{in the city of}} Ghazni outside the Ghazni governor's compound. She was holding two small bags at her side while crouching on the ground. This aroused the officer's suspicion, raising concerns that she might be concealing a bomb under her burqa. Previously, a shopkeeper had noticed a woman in a burqa drawing a map, which is suspicious in Afghanistan where women are generally illiterate. There had also been a report that a Pakistani woman in a burqa with a boy were traveling in Afghanistan urging women to volunteer for suicide bombing. She was accompanied by a young boy that she said was her adopted son. She said her name was Saliha, that she was from Multan in Pakistan, and that the boy's name was Ali Hassan. Discovering that she did not speak either of Afghanistan's main languages, Pashtu or Dari, the officers regarded her as suspicious. She told the police <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> for her husband, needed no help, and started to walk away. She was arrested and taken to the police station for questioning. She initially claimed the boy was her stepson, Ali Hassan. (The woman was not identified as Siddiqui until after hospitalized and fingerprinted. She subsequently admitted he was her biological son when DNA testing proved the boy to be Ahmed.|$|E
