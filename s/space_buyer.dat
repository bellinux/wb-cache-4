40|$|A firm facing {{liquidity}} constraints in {{a recession}} may increase its price to exploit locked-in consumers {{in an attempt to}} boost short-run profits. We find support for such behaviour for Swedish regional newspapers during a deep recession. Newspapers sell both subscriptions and advertising <b>space,</b> and arguably <b>buyers</b> of the latter are less locked in. Newspapers with low solvency raised their subscription prices relative to others. In contrast, the changes in advertising price were independent of the newspapers' financial positions. Hence financial constraints affected firms' pricing behaviour only when consumers were locked in. Copyright (c) The London School of Economics and Political Science 2005. ...|$|R

40|$|We analyze a {{nonlinear}} {{pricing model}} with limited information. Each buyer can purchase a large variety, d, of goods. His preference for each good {{is represented by}} a scalar and his preference over d goods is represented by a d-dimensional vector. The type <b>space</b> of each <b>buyer</b> is given by a compact subset of R d + with a continuum of possible types. By contrast, the seller is limited to o¤er a …nite number M of d-dimensional choices. We provide necessary conditions that the optimal finite menu of the social welfare maximizing problem has to satisfy. We establish an underlying connection {{to the theory of}} quantization and provide an estimate of the welfare loss resulting from the usage of the d-dimensional M-class menu. We show that the welfare loss converges to zero at a rate proportional to d=M 2 =d. We show that in higher dimensions, a significant reduction in the welfare loss arises from an optimal partition of the d-dimensional type space that takes advantage of the correlation among the d parameters...|$|R
40|$|Drawing on {{recently}} published data, this report examines {{some of the}} trends in travel e-commerce. Using a case study approach, the author examines in detail some of the e-business models impacting on the travel industry both in the Business-to-Business (B 2 B) and Business-to-Consumer (B 2 C) markets. Although B 2 C leisure transactions currently account for just 1 % {{of the value of}} global travel, there is real potential for future growth. However to be successful both new entrants and existing players will need to ensure their e-business model adds value for the customer, otherwise their position in the value chain will be threatened. The most immediate potential for growth and profitability lies in the B 2 B market, particularly in the development of vertical portals or community extranets. These are virtual <b>spaces</b> enabling travel <b>buyers</b> and suppliers to trade online. The integration of legacy systems with Internet Protocol (IP) technology is taking place across a range of travel sectors and will provide the platform on which a wide range of e-business applications can be developed. This development will lead to the ultimate catalyst for travel e-business [...] the convergence of data (internet), voice (telephone) and video (television) ...|$|R
40|$|Online {{advertisements}} (ads) {{provide a}} powerful mechanism for advertisers to effectively target Web users. Ads can be customized {{based on a}} user’s browsing behavior, geographic location, and personal interests. There is currently a multi-billion dollar market for online advertising, which generates the primary revenue {{for some of the}} most popular websites on the Internet. In order to meet the immense market demand, and to manage the complex relationships between advertisers and publishers (i. e., the websites hosting the ads), marketplaces known as “ad exchanges ” are employed. These exchanges allow publishers (sellers of ad <b>space)</b> and advertisers (<b>buyers</b> of this ad space) to dynamically broker traffic through ad networks to efficiently maximize profits for all parties. Unfortunately, the complexities of these systems invite a considerable amount of abuse from cybercriminals, who profit at the expense of the advertisers. In this paper, we present a detailed view of how one of the largest ad exchanges operates and the associated security issues from the vantage point of a member ad network. More specifically, we analyzed a dataset containing transactions for ingress and egress ad traffic from this ad network. In addition, we examined information collected from a command-and-control server used to operate a botnet that is leveraged to perpetrate ad fraud against the same ad exchange...|$|R
