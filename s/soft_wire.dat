50|$|Barbed wire for {{agricultural}} fencing is typically available in two varieties: soft or mild-steel wire and high-tensile. Both types are galvanized for longevity. High-tensile wire {{is made with}} thinner but higher-strength steel. Its greater strength makes fences longer lasting because it resists stretching and loosening better, coping with expansion and contraction caused by heat and animal pressure by stretching and relaxing within wider elastic limits. It also supports longer spans, but because of its elastic (springy) nature {{it is harder to}} handle and somewhat dangerous for inexperienced fencers. <b>Soft</b> <b>wire</b> is much easier to work but is less durable and only suitable for short spans such as repairs and gates, where it is less likely to tangle.|$|E

40|$|Domain wall pinning is the {{coercivity}} {{mechanism of}} permanent magnets used in high temperature applications. In SmCo based magnets domain walls get trapped at the cellular precipitation structure causing a high coercive field. The motion of domain walls and their propagation velocity {{are important in}} soft magnets as used in sensor applications.

The cellular microstructure of SmCo magnets or the cylin-drical <b>soft</b> <b>wires</b> can be easily built using tetrahedral finite elements. The pinning of the domain walls has been studied for different material composi-tions. Attractive and repulsive domain wall pinning are observed and their behaviour for increasing thickness of the precipitation structure is explained. 1 The motion of domains in magnetic nanowires was calculated using adaptive mesh refinement.

50|$|In the United States, Australia, {{and around}} the world, baling wire was used in {{mechanical}} hay balers pulled behind a tractor. The automated balers used a wire twister that first cut then twisted {{the ends of the}} wire such that the bale kept its shape after the baler had pressed the hay into a tight rectangular bale. These hay balers were in common use up until the late 1980s. When the hay was fed to livestock the wire was cut and often hung in bundles or stored in barrels or metal drums around the farm. Farmers used the <b>soft</b> <b>wire</b> for temporary repairs of almost everything you could think of on the farm, from fences, old leather horse harnesses, head stalls and bridles, to pins to keep castellated nuts in place on the tractor. Even tiny screwdrivers were made by cutting a short length of wire and looping one end for grip. The other end was then flattened and shaped to make a screwdriver for specialized tasks like replacing the tiny screws in reading glasses.|$|E

Case Presentation Here we describe an endoscopic technique by which a safe bowel decompression was performed instead of emergency surgery in two patients with complete tumorous obstruction of the colon. By means of a polypectomy snare, a <b>soft</b> <b>wire,</b> an ERCP catheter, a set of endoscopes with different diameters (baby endoscope, gastroscope) and of argon plasma coagulation the tumor mass was reduced and the tumor stenosis was passed. The patients recovered from symptoms of colon obstruction, no procedure-associated complications were observed. One patient had surgery of the sigmoid tumor one week later (UICC-stage III), the other patient (UICC-stage IV) received systemic chemotherapy starting one week after endoscopic decompression.

40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the degradation of}} wire electrode during electrical discharge machining of SiC reinforced Al-based metal matrix composites (MMCs). MMCs with different size of reinforcements (0. 7, 3 and 13. µm) as well as corresponding matrix material were machined under similar machining conditions to understand the effect of reinforcement size {{on the degradation of}} wire. In addition, pulse-on-time and wire tension were varied to understand the effect of machining parameters and interaction between machining parameters and size of the reinforcements. It was found that initial circular shaped wire deformed during the machining process as curved front and rear edges and two straight side edges irrespective of cutting conditions and workpiece materials. The curved edge at the front and straight side edges take part in material removal and experience sever degradations. The final cross-sectional area of the wire after the machining process is decided by balancing two mechanisms: (i) downward flow of highly malleable <b>soft</b> <b>wire</b> material due to high temperature which increases the diameter of wire electrode and (ii) vaporisation of the wire material at higher temperature which reduces the diameter of wire electrode. These complex processes are affected by machining conditions as well as workpiece materials...|$|E

40|$|Lubricating {{materials}} {{for use in}} a vacuum environment {{have been the subject of}} a series of experimental investigations. Evaporation properties were evaluated for solid polymeric compositions. Friction and wear studies explored the behavior during sliding contact for series of polymeric compositions, binary alloys containing soft film-forming phases, complex alloys with film-forming materials, and a burnished MoS 2 film. Friction and wear experiments were conducted at 10 (exp- 9) mm Hg with a 3 / 16 -inch-radius-hemisphere rider specimen sliding on the flat surface of a rotating 2 - 1 / 2 -inch-diameter disk specimen with materials that had low rates of evaporation. The influence of fillers in polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) on decomposition during vacuum friction studies was determined with a mass spectrometer. A real advantage in reducing decomposition and improving friction wear properties is gained by adding fillers (e. g., copper) that improve thermal conductivity through the composite materials. A polyimide and an epoxy-MoS 2 composition material were found to have better friction and wear properties than PTFE compositions. A series of alloys (cast binary as well as more complex alloys) that contained microinclusions of potential film-forming material was studied. These materials replaced the normal surface oxides as they were worn away on sliding contact. Iron sulfide, nickel oxide, and tin are typical film-forming materials employed and were demonstrated to be effective in inhibiting surface welding and reducing friction. A burnished MoS 2 film applied to type 440 -C stainless steel in argon with a rotating <b>soft</b> <b>wire</b> brush had good endurance properties but somewhat higher friction than commercially available bonded films.

40|$|Problem statement: Sugarcane leaf-removing tools {{could help}} speed up {{sugarcane}} harvest and reduce contamination. Moreover, leaf-removal machinery can {{solve the problems}} of sugarcane burning and workers can increase sugarcane harvest production too. The purpose of this research was to study the use of leaf-removal machinery in the post-harvest production of sugarcane to reduce harvest production time and contaminant. Approach: This study focused on the LK 92 - 11 variety of sugarcane having a harvesting period of 12 months, a density of 9, 387 stems/rai and could produce 14. 01 tons/rai including cane top and, leaves and leaf sheaths of 1675. 2 and 180 kg/rai. Sugarcane leaf-removal machinery was applied to a small engine power from a grass-cutting machine. A rotate dish applied 4 different materials, tendon string, <b>soft</b> <b>wire,</b> medium wire and sling for sugarcane leaf-removing. The machine was operated at a constant speed. The efficiency of the sugarcane leaf-removal machinery indicated the capacity of sugarcane leaf-removing by area and operation time. Results: The quantity of leaves and leaf sheaths affect the speed of harvest production. Moreover, leaves and leaf sheaths increase the waste material in production and also contaminate the sugar and the sugar production system with clay, sand, and mud from the fields. Traditional methods for sugarcane harvest without removing leaf took 37 h/rai to complete, but sugarcane leaf-removing could reduce the sugarcane harvest process to 11. 4 h/rai. Conclusion: The material of the blades in de-leafing machine is crucial to the efficiency of harvest production time. Blades made from poor materials can cause tangling and clogging in the rotator dish, which increases maintenance time. Further developments in sugarcane leaf removal systems will create dramatic improvement in sugarcane production...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a development case of robotic machine for {{the dismantling of}} steel-concrete structures using diamond wire technology. The {{focus is on the}} application of the so called soft-wire with core made of superelastic alloy in place of the steel rope traditionally used. Remote-controlled machinery operating in risky areas must be the simplest possible for reliability and to shorten the development time as generally these machines are tailored to the task. In the case of dismantling of nuclear equipment there are two additional reasons to prefer simple designs: The need to decommission the cutting machinery together with the nuclear wastes and the limit to the use of electronics onboard due to radiation. With steel-cored cutting wires an active tensioner is needed to compensate for tension shocks occurring during cutting. This is the most complex component of the cutting system and it requires a control system with actuation and some electronics. A significant benefit comes from the removal of the active tensioner. The current direction is the use of soft wires in place of the ones with steel core. The steel rope is replaced by a core wire made of superelastic alloy. The tension of the wire is an independent cutting parameter. The selection of the core wire architecture and diameter, the point along the stress-strain curve where the wire superelastic alloy is in nominal conditions and the use of stress-strain plafond in the curve are critical. The paper discusses first the principles of cutting with <b>soft</b> <b>wire.</b> Then the design of the cutting system is addressed and the requirements of robotized cutting machinery is discusses.
