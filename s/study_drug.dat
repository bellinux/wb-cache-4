25|$|In most countries, fluoroquinolones are {{approved}} {{for use in}} children only under narrowly-defined circumstances, owing {{in part to the}} observation of high rates of musculoskeletal adverse events in fluoroquinolone treated juvenile animals. In the UK, the prescribing indications for fluoroquinolones for children are severely restricted. Only inhalant anthrax and pseudomonal infections in cystic fibrosis infections are licensed indications in the UK due to ongoing safety concerns. In a study comparing the safety and efficacy of levofloxacin to that of azithromycin or ceftriaxone in 712 children with community-acquired pneumonia, serious adverse events were experienced by 6% of those treated with levofloxacin and 4% of those treated with comparator antibiotics. Most of these were considered by the treating physician to be unrelated or doubtfully related to the <b>study</b> <b>drug.</b> Two deaths were observed in the levofloxacin group, neither of which was thought to be treatment-related. Spontaneous reports to the U.S. FDA Adverse Effects Reporting System {{at the time of the}} 20 September 2011 U.S. FDA Pediatric Drugs Advisory Committee included musculoskeletal events (39, including 5 cases of tendon rupture) and central nervous system events (19, including 5 cases of seizures) as the most common spontaneous reports between April 2005 and March 2008. An estimated 130,000 pediatric prescriptions for levofloxacin were filled on behalf of 112,000 pediatric patients during that period.|$|E

40|$|A simple, selective, {{and precise}} densitometric method for {{analysis}} of four α-aminocephalosporins, namely cefaclor monohydrate, cefadroxil monohydrate, cefalexin anhydrous, and cefradine anhydrous, both in bulk drugs and in formulations was developed and validated. The method employed thin-layer chromatography (TLC) aluminium sheets precoated with silica gel G 60 F 254 as the stationary phase. The solvent system consists of ethyl acetate–methanol–water with different ratios for all <b>studied</b> <b>drugs</b> (Rf values of 0. 40 – 0. 60). The separated spots were visualized as blue to violet color after spraying with ninhydrin reagent. The linear regression analysis data for the calibration plots of all <b>studied</b> <b>drugs</b> produced a good linear relationship with correlation coefficients ranging from 0. 9990 to 0. 9996 and coefficients of determination ranging from 0. 9986 to 0. 9992 over the concentration range 2 – 10 µg/spot. The limits of detection and quantitation for all <b>studied</b> <b>drugs</b> ranged from 0. 09 to 0. 23 and from 0. 27 to 0. 84 µg/spot, respectively. The developed method was applied successfully for {{the determination of the}} <b>studied</b> <b>drugs</b> in their pharmaceutical dosage forms with good precision and accuracy.

40|$|We {{aimed to}} compare the effects of pazopanib, sunitinib, and {{sorafenib}} on endometriotic tissue morphology and histological characteristics as well as ovarian reserve in a rat model. Experimental endometriosis was established in 32 rats. They were randomly divided into 4 groups (8 rats for each group) to administer study drugs: pazopanib, sunitinib, sorafenib, and normal saline. Histological examination with hematoxylin and eosin staining to determine endometriosis score and immunostaining with primary vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), CD 117, and Bax antibodies were performed. Bilateral ovaries excised to determine the ovarian follicle number. The endometriosis score was significantly reduced by pazopanib compared to other <b>study</b> <b>drugs</b> and by sunitinib compared to sorafenib and normal saline (P . 05). The VEGF score was significantly decreased similarly by pazopanib, sunitinib, and sorafenib compared to normal saline (P . 05). No <b>study</b> <b>drugs</b> caused meaningful change in the ovarian follicle number (P>. 05). Pazopanib reduces the growth of endometriotic implants.

The probability of disease progression at 24 month followup was lower in the fingolimod groups compared to placebo (hazard ratio 0.70 at 0.5 mg and 0.68 at 1.25 mg).

Serious adverse events in the fingolimod group included bradycardia, relapse, and basal-cell carcinoma. Seven episodes of bradycardia occurred during the monitoring period after administration of the first dose, and were asymptomatic in six of these cases. There was a higher rate of lower respiratory tract infections (including bronchitis and pneumonia) in the fingolimod groups (9.6% at 0.5 mg, 11.4% at 1.5 mg) than the placebo group (6.0%).

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{sensitive}} kinetic spectrophotometric method {{was developed for}} the determination of some fluoroquinolonea antibiotics; gemifloxacin mesylate, moxifloxacin hydrochloride and gatifloxacin in bulk and in pharmaceutical preparations. The method is based upon a kinetic investigation of the oxidation reaction of the drugs with alkaline potassium permanganate {{at room temperature for}} a fixed time of 20 min for gemifloxacin and 15 min for moxifloxacin or gatifloxacin. The absorbance of the coloured manganate ion was measured at 610 nm. The absorbance–concentration plots were rectilinear over the ranges of 2. 0 - 20, 4. 0 - 24 and 4. 0 - 40 µg mL − 1 for gemifloxacin, moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin, respectively. The concentrations of the <b>studied</b> <b>drugs</b> were calculated using the corresponding calibration equations for the fixed-time method. The determination of the <b>studied</b> <b>drugs</b> by the fixed concentration and rate constant methods was also feasible with the calibration equations obtained but the fixed time method {{has been found to be}} more applicable.
