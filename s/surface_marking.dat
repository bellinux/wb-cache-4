25|$|A road <b>surface</b> <b>marking</b> is {{any kind}} of device or {{material}} that is used on a road surface in order to convey official information for drivers and pedestrians. Edward N. Hines originated the concept of painting a line {{down the center of}} a road to separate traffic in opposing directions. They were first used in Wayne County, Michigan in 1911.|$|E

5000|$|Henry’s sculptures are {{modelled}} in clay {{before being}} painted {{by the artist}} using oil and other paints, on either a cast bronze or ceramic <b>surface.</b> <b>Mark</b> Lawson has described Henry's offshore sculpture Couple as [...] "confirming the current power of public art".|$|R
50|$|The {{accuracy}} of a spirit level can be checked by placing it on any flat <b>surface,</b> <b>marking</b> the bubble's position and rotating the level 180°. The {{position of the}} bubble should then be symmetrical to the first reading. Machinist's levels provide screw mechanisms to center the bubbles.|$|E
50|$|With lamp cord wire the {{ribbed wire}} is the neutral, and the smooth wire is the hot. NEC2008 400.22(f) allows <b>surface</b> <b>marking</b> with ridged, grooves or white stripes {{on the surface}} of lamp cord. With {{transparent}} cord the hot wire is copper colored, and the neutral is silver colored.|$|E
50|$|More unusual {{methods have}} {{included}} tearing or slicing the stamp, {{but this is}} a slower process and can easily damage the contents, and was only occasionally used. An example is 19th-century Afghanistan, where cancellation involved the removal of part of the stamp rather than applying ink or other <b>surface</b> <b>marking.</b>|$|E

50|$|Road <b>surface</b> <b>marking</b> is {{any kind}} of device or {{material}} that is used on a road surface in order to convey official information; they are commonly placed with road marking machines (or road marking equipment, pavement marking equipment). They can also be applied in other facilities used by vehicles to mark parking spaces or designate areas for other uses.|$|E
50|$|Retroglo {{is made up}} of 50,000 minute {{glass beads}} in each square inch. The {{material}} is retroreflective, meaning it reflects light directly back to a light source, such as toward a car's headlights. The glass beads used in Retroglo are much smaller than the beads used in reflective road <b>surface</b> <b>marking</b> paint used on highways. Retroglo can be woven, braided or knit into fabrics or into trim to be applied to fabric.|$|E
5000|$|Mount Rymill (...) is {{a fairly}} massive {{mountain}} with an undulating <b>surface</b> <b>marked</b> by extensive formation of stone polygons, standing 6 mi W of Mount Stinear. Photographed from the air by ANARE, 1956-58. Named by ANCA for John Riddoch Rymill, leader of the British Graham Land Expedition, 1934-37.|$|R
50|$|Calathea makoyana is an {{evergreen}} perennial, {{growing to}} 45 cm, with round pale green leaves, the upper <b>surfaces</b> <b>marked</b> with dark green blotches along the veins, {{and the lower}} surfaces coloured deep purple. It requires a minimum temperature of 16 C, and in temperate areas is often cultivated as a houseplant.|$|R
5000|$|Dr. Royston {{remained}} at UCSD until 1990, earning tenure while continuing his entrepreneurial activities. During those years, {{he served as}} the director of UCSD's Cell <b>Surface</b> <b>Marker</b> Laboratory, as director of the Clinical Immunology Program at the UCSD Cancer Center, and as chief of the Oncology Section at the VA Medical Center in San Diego.|$|R
50|$|The hostile seas, {{where the}} Southern Ocean meets with Bass Strait, that {{surround}} Cape Otway {{are home to}} some of the worlds most prized marine species including crayfish and abalone. It is common on calm days for there to be as many as 20 abalone dive boats operating along the shoreline beneath the light house. Commercial cray fishers use baited pots or traps throughout the reef system, with white floats on the <b>surface</b> <b>marking</b> their locations.|$|E
50|$|Road surface {{markings}} {{are used}} on paved roadways to provide guidance and information to drivers and pedestrians. Uniformity of the markings {{is an important}} factor in minimizing confusion and uncertainty about their meaning, and efforts exist to standardize such markings across borders. However, countries and areas categorize and specify road surface markings in different ways — white lines are called white lines mechanical, non-mechanical, or temporary. They can be used to delineate traffic lanes, inform motorists and pedestrians or serve as noise generators when run across a road, or attempt to wake a sleeping driver when installed in the shoulders of a road. Road <b>surface</b> <b>marking</b> can also indicate regulation for parking and stopping.|$|E
50|$|Highway Safety Improvement: The act {{provided}} {{funding for}} capital improvements to roads that improved safety, such as guard rails or improved railway-road at-grade crossings. The act also required DOT to establish program of data collection, research, and demonstration programs to improve highway safety by improving highway construction standards. Additionally, DOT was authorized {{to pay for}} demonstration projects to determine the effectiveness of road <b>surface</b> <b>marking.</b> Finally, {{as part of the}} War on Drugs, DOT was required to study the effect of illegal drug use on traffic and driver safety. DOT was also required to study ways in which the mass media could be used to inform the public about the number and severity of highway accidents, and educate them about how to reduce highway accidents.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} {{floor is}} a nearly level <b>surface</b> <b>marked</b> by several tiny ghost-crater rims projecting {{above the surface}} {{and a pair of}} clefts {{in the southern part of}} the floor. A small, bowl-shaped impact crater forms a prominent feature in the northern half of the floor. There is no central peak formation at or near the midpoint of the interior.|$|R
5|$|At {{his home}} in Much Hadham, Moore built up a {{collection}} of natural objects; skulls, driftwood, pebbles, rocks and shells, which he would use to provide inspiration for organic forms. For his largest works, he usually produced a half-scale, working model before scaling up for the final moulding and casting at a bronze foundry. Moore often refined the final full plaster shape and added <b>surface</b> <b>marks</b> before casting.|$|R
50|$|An {{expanding}} universe generally has a cosmological horizon, which, by analogy {{with the more}} familiar horizon caused by the curvature of Earth's <b>surface,</b> <b>marks</b> the boundary of {{the part of the}} Universe that an observer can see. Light (or other radiation) emitted by objects beyond the cosmological horizon in an Accelerating universe never reaches the observer, because the space in between the observer and the object is expanding too rapidly.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{worth noting}} {{is that the}} broad visual spacing of the grooves on the 12-inch {{made it easy for}} the DJ in {{locating}} the approximate area of the [...] "breaks" [...] on the disc's surface (without having to listen as he dropped and re-dropped the stylus to find the right point). A quick study of any DJs favorite discs will reveal mild wear in the [...] "break points" [...] on the discs' surfaces that can clearly be seen by the naked eye, which further eases the [...] "cueing" [...] task (a club DJs tone-arm cartridge will be heavily weighted and mild wear will seldom spoil the sound quality). Many DJ-only remix services, such as Ultimix and Hot Tracks, issued sets with deliberately visualised groove separations (i.e., the record was cut with narrow and wider spacings that could be seen on the <b>surface,</b> <b>marking</b> the mix points on the often multi-song discs).|$|E
50|$|The {{safety of}} the {{competitors}} and officials is also a fundamental requirement. Further to the admission requirements, each diver {{will be required to}} be equipped with a BCD, an alternative air source such as an auxiliary demand valve or pony bottle and a <b>surface</b> <b>marking</b> system as well as their diving regulator must be fitted with a submersible pressure gauge. All dives are to be conducted in accordance with CMAS rules. The host shall provide details of local emergency services and protocols and a suitably staffed high speed boat fitted with radio and emergency first aid equipment including oxygen administration equipment for the purpose of rendering first aid to any injured diver and organise the attendance of a medical practitioner qualified in diving medicine at each day of diving. Also, each boat provided for the competition teams will be supplied with an oxygen administration kit and a spare diving cylinder intended only for emergency use.|$|E

30|$|Figure  3 c {{provides}} some {{different views of}} the new generated surface. Some dislocation {{can be seen on}} the surface. It is also seen that the dislocations on the machining <b>surface</b> <b>marked</b> with numbers 7 and 8 are parallel with the slip vectors [ī 0 ī] and [ī 01]. The two directions in the specimen are the easiest glide vectors in the surface. Many generated dislocations are involved in the accumulated atom pile-up in front of the diamond tool. The black arrow in the figures indicates the cutting direction. Some defects remained on the machining-induced <b>surface,</b> <b>marked</b> with numbers 9 and 11 in Figure  3 c. The vacancy-related defects on the machining-induced surface, number 9, are not only immobile but are also located limited on the surface, while the dislocation-related defects are completely contrary. The dislocation loop is usually distributed along with such a defect on the surface. The dislocation nucleation and escape in submicrometer single-crystal FCC metal materials have been observed and proven in some previous studies using experiments and simulations[18, 19].|$|R
