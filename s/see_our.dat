25|$|Prior to the final, the GAA {{stated that}} the All-Ireland final post-match {{presentation}} of the Liam MacCarthy Cup would {{be returned to the}} centre of the pitch. The Association were considering a return to the centre of Croke Park for All-Ireland day presentations since the 2008 football decider between Tyrone and Kerry when Kerry's Colm Cooper was jostled by rival supporters as he left the field following the final whistle. From 1999 to 2001, presentations were made in the centre of Croke Park and passed off largely without incident. However, a pitch invasion by fans following the 2009 hurling final meant plans to change the style of trophy presentation were cancelled, with Kilkenny captain Michael Fennelly receiving the Liam MacCarthy Cup in the Hogan Stand of Croke Park. GAA President Christy Cooney later spoke of his disappointment about the pitch invasion but indicated that it confirmed his belief that the invasions must stop. He said: Despite all pre-match communications, press publicity and big-screen appeals, it was extremely disappointing to <b>see</b> <b>our</b> plans were not realised. Even allowing for all the exuberance and joy of supporters on the day, it was disappointing to see the disregard for the safety of others amongst fans intent on getting on the pitch and ignoring safety appeals. The Kilkenny County Board later complained about the presentation.|$|E

500|$|Reagan {{testified before}} the House Un-American Activities Committee on the subject as well. A fervent anti-communist, he reaffirmed his {{commitment}} to democratic principles, stating, [...] "I never as a citizen want to <b>see</b> <b>our</b> country become urged, by either fear or resentment of this group, that we ever compromise with any of our democratic principles through that fear or resentment." ...|$|E

500|$|Al-Tamimi is {{an admirer}} of Indian {{independence}} leader Mahatma Gandhi and believes that armed conflict against a more powerful Israeli opponent will only bring disaster. Al-Tamimi states that he advocates nonviolent resistance, telling a reporter in 2011, [...] "Our strategic choice of a popular struggle—as a means to fight the occupation taking over our lands, lives and future—is a declaration {{that we do not}} harm human lives. The very essence of our activity opposes killing." [...] However, he has stated he is not concerned as to whether stone-throwing is a form of violence, but views it instead as a symbol of Palestinian resistance: [...] "We <b>see</b> <b>our</b> stones as our message." ...|$|E
500|$|Bolt's record-setting runs caused {{commentators}} {{not only}} to praise his achievements but also to speculate about his potential {{to become one of}} the most successful sprinters ever. Critics hailed his Olympic success as a new beginning for a sport that had long suffered through high-profile drug scandals. The previous six years had seen the BALCO scandal, Tim Montgomery and Justin Gatlin stripped of their 100 m world records, and Marion Jones returning three Olympic gold medals. All three sprinters were disqualified from athletics after drugs tests detected banned substances in their systems. Bolt's record-breaking performances caused suspicion among some commentators, including Victor Conte, and the lack of an independent Caribbean anti-doping federation raised more concerns. The accusations of drug use were vehemently rejected by Glen Mills (Bolt's coach) and Herb Elliott (the Jamaican athletics team doctor). Elliott, a member of the IAAF anti-doping commission, urged those concerned about the issue to [...] "come down and <b>see</b> <b>our</b> programme, come down and <b>see</b> <b>our</b> testing, we have nothing to hide". Mills had been equally ardent that Bolt was a clean athlete, declaring to the Jamaica Gleaner: [...] "We will test any time, any day, any part of the body... doesn't even like to take vitamins". Bolt stated that he had been tested four times prior to the Olympics, and all had tested negative for banned substances. He also welcomed anti-doping authorities to test him to prove that he was clean, stating, [...] "We work hard and we perform well and we know we're clean".|$|E

War and apocalyptic disaster was an especially common theme; Gold reported that [...] "Over 90% of stories submitted still nag away at ...

About the return of Libby, Cuse stated, [...] "Finally, all of your questions [...] will be answered", however, Lindelof jokingly responded, [...] "No, they will not". Watros said about the reunion with Hurley and Libby in season six: [...] " [...] so sweet and honest. And I think, hopefully, when people <b>see</b> <b>our</b> scenes that they’ll get that feeling, too. [...] are so incredibly real with each other. I was really grateful that I got to play those scenes and Libby got to sort of express herself in ways that she hasn’t been able to." ...|$|E
500|$|East Coker gives {{a message}} of hope that the English {{communities}} would survive through World War II. In a letter dated 9 February 1940, Eliot stated, [...] "We can have very little hope of contributing to any immediate social change; and we are more disposed to <b>see</b> <b>our</b> hope in modest and local beginnings, than in transforming the whole world at once... We must keep alive aspirations which can remain valid throughout the longest and darkest period of universal calamity and degradation." [...] The poem also relied on the war {{as a way to}} connect to Eliot's idea that there was a united humanity. In particular, Stephen Spender claimed that [...] "the war modified [...] attitude by convincing him that there was a Western cause to be positively defended. And after the war there was a Germany to be brought back within the Western tradition".|$|E

500|$|Lambert had the acumen {{to refuse}} the {{management}} offers of various impresarios and agents, and by , {{he had returned}} to Leicester as a wealthy man. [...] He returned to his favourite pastimes, breeding sporting dogs and fighting cocks. A terrier bitch, {{for which he was}} offered 100guineas (about £ as of [...] ), was said to be the finest in England. He refused to sell the dog, which became his lifetime companion. He began again to attend sporting events, as a report on the Leicester Races of September 1806 noted that [...] "Among the distinguished characters upon the turf we were glad to <b>see</b> <b>our</b> old friend, Mr.Daniel Lambert, in apparent high health and spirits". Although too heavy to follow hunts on horseback, he used a portion of the money earned in London to build up a pack of greyhounds, watching from his carriage as they coursed hares in the Leicestershire countryside.|$|E
500|$|... "Hero" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Mariah Carey. It was released on October 19, 1993, via Columbia Records as the second single from Carey's third studio album, Music Box (1993). Originally intended for Gloria Estefan, the song was written by Mariah and produced by her and Walter Afanasieff. While writing the song, Carey did not connect to its style or sound, therefore forfeiting {{it over to the}} soundtrack of the film of the same name. However, after being convinced to keep it, she personalized it, giving it a more pop and R melody, as well as changing some of the lyrics to more precisely fit her personality. Lyrically, the song is regarded as one of Carey's most inspirational and personal ballads, with its protagonist declaring that even though we may feel discouraged or down at times, in reality, we are [...] "heroes" [...] if we look inside ourselves and <b>see</b> <b>our</b> own inner strength; in time, it will help us [...] "find the way." ...|$|E
500|$|At the USAID preview screening, actress Lucy Liu, who {{has worked}} with MTV EXIT and {{produced}} the documentary film Redlight, said that people who watch Not My Life [...] "will be shocked to find [...] is happening in America"; she said that there were 80,000 women being sexually assaulted daily and she called human trafficking the [...] "cannibalization of the planet's youth." [...] According to UN.GIFT, before Not My Life, there was [...] "no single communication tool that effectively depict the problem as a whole for a mass audience." [...] Susan Bissell, UNICEF's Child Protection Section chief, agreed with this assertion, and said that the film [...] "takes {{a close look at the}} underlying causality that so many other filmmakers have missed [...] it will change the way we <b>see</b> <b>our</b> lives, in some very fundamental ways." [...] She also said that Not My Life is an important documentary because it brings attention to underreported forms of abuse. A reviewer from Medical News Today praised the film for [...] "raising awareness and speaking about taboo subjects," [...] arguing that these activities [...] "are critical to empower families, communities, and governments to speak out honestly and take action against abuses." ...|$|E
