40|$|Integrating terror {{management}} {{theory and}} objective self-awareness theory, we propose the existential escape hypothesis, {{which states that}} people with low self-esteem should be especially prone to escaping self-awareness as a distal response to thoughts of death. This is because they lack the means to bolster the self as a defense, and the propensity to bolster the <b>self</b> <b>reduces</b> the motivation to escape from self-awareness. Five studies supported this hypothesis. Individuals low, but not high, in self-esteem scored lower on a measure of private self-awareness (Study 1), showed less implicit self-activation (Studies 2 & 3), {{were more likely to}} choose to write about others than themselves (Study 4), and consumed more alcohol in a field study at a nightclub (Study 5) in response to mortality reminders. Implications for terror management theory (highlighting an additional route to defend against mortality awareness), self-regulation, physical health and well-being are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In diploid organisms, <b>selfing</b> <b>reduces</b> the {{efficiency}} of selection in removing deleterious mutations from a population. This need {{not be the case}} for all organisms. Some plants, for example, undergo an extreme form of selfing known as intragametophytic selfing, which immediately exposes all recessive deleterious mutations in a parental genome to selective purging. Here we ask how effectively deleterious mutations are removed from such plants. Specifically, we study the extent to which deleterious mutations accumulate in a predominantly selfing and a predominantly outcrossing pair of moss species, using genome- wide transcriptome data. We find that the selfing species purge significantly more non- synonymous mutations, as well as a greater proportion of radical amino acid changes which alter physicochemical properties of amino acids. Moreover, their purging of deleterious mutation is especially strong in conserved regions of protein-coding genes. Our observations show that selfing need not impede but can even accelerate the removal of deleterious mutations, and do so on a genome-wide scale...|$|R

40|$|The {{pig iron}} nugget process was {{developed}} {{as an alternative}} to the traditional blast furnace process by Kobe Steel. The process aimed to produce pig iron nuggets, which have similar chemical and physical properties to blast furnace pig iron, in a single step. The pig iron nugget process utilizes coal instead of coke and <b>self</b> <b>reducing</b> and fluxing dried green balls instead of pellets and sinters. In this process the environmental emissions caused by coke and sinter production, and energy lost between pellet induration (heat hardening) and transportation to the blast furnace can be eliminated. The objectives of this research were to (1) produce pig iron nuggets in the laboratory, (2) characterize the pig iron nugget produced and compare them with blast furnace pig iron, (3) investigate the furnace temperature and residence time effects on the pig iron nugget production, and (4) optimize the operational furnace temperatures and residence times. The experiments involved heat treatment of <b>self</b> <b>reducing</b> and fluxing dried green balls at various furnace temperatures and residence times. Three chemically and physically different products were produced after the compete reduction of iron oxides to iron depending on the operational furnace temperatures and/or residence times. These products were direct reduced iron (DRI), transition direct reduced iron (TDRI), and pig iron nuggets. The increase in the carbon content of the system as a function of furnace temperature and/or residence time dictated the formation of these products. The direct reduced iron, transition direct reduced iron, and pig iron nuggets produced were analyzed for their chemical composition, degree of metallization, apparent density, microstructure and microhardness. In addition, the change in the carbon content of the system with the changing furnace temperature and/or residence time was detected by optical microscopy and Microhardness measurements. The sufficient carbon dissolution required for the production of pig iron nuggets was determined. It was determined that pig iron nuggets produced had a high apparent density (6. 7 - 7. 2 gr/cm 3), highly metallized, slag free structure, high iron content (95 - 97 %), high microhardness values (> 325 HVN) and microstructure similar to white cast iron. These properties made them a competitive alternative to blast furnace pig iron...|$|R
40|$|It is {{difficult}} to describe what takes place when we reflect on our thoughts, feelings, or actions without resorting to metaphor. “Detachment,” “getting outside of ourselves,” “taking a step back”—all of these expressions use the metaphor of distance to describe {{what happens when we}} relate to mental states in a way that differs from our initial experience of them. This dissertation aims to demonstrate that gaining psychological distance from ourselves and our thoughts can improve decision-making, strengthen emotion regulation, and, ultimately, increase well-being. Chapter 2 demonstrates that self-distancing can reduce biased thought: Writing while using second- or third-person pronouns (e. g., “you,” “he,” or “she”) to refer to the <b>self</b> <b>reduces</b> the correspondence bias. Chapter 3 demonstrates that this same type of self-distanced writing can improve well-established cognitive behavioral therapy homework interventions, leading to increased life satisfaction.

40|$|Two {{groups of}} {{patients}} referred for suspicion of acute appendicitis {{were compared to}} evaluate the accuracy of preoperative ultrasonography (US) and surgical decision-making. In one retrospective study, US was performed by trainees using a 3. 5 MHz probe (219 patients). In the second prospective study, US was performed by a resident radiologist using a 5 MHz probe (144 patients). US accuracy rose from 65 % to 90 %, especially due to an improved negative predictive value (from 52 % to 92 %). The positive predictive value of US was 89 %. The sonographically adjusted clinical decision to operate was correct in 85 %. Thus, all patients with positive US should be operated. In contrast, clinical judgment must prevail in case of negative US findings {{in order to prevent}} surgical delay in about 11 %. The negative laparotomy rate decreased by 5 % only. This is probably due to the limited influence of negative US findings on surgical decision. US is to be recommended in all patients suspected for acute appendicitis when performed with an appropriate probe by an experienced ultrasonographist.

40|$|Abstract Background There are few {{predictions}} about the directionality or extent of morphological trait (mis) matches between interacting organisms. We review and analyse studies on morphological trait complementarity (e. g. floral tube length versus insect mouthpart length) at the population and species level. Results Plants have consistently more exaggerated morphological traits than insects at high trait magnitudes {{and in some cases}} less exaggerated traits than insects at smaller trait magnitudes. This result held at the population level, as well as for phylogenetically adjusted analyses at the species-level and for both pollination and host-parasite interactions, perhaps suggesting a general pattern. Across communities, the degree of trait mismatch between one specialist plant and its more generalized pollinator was related to the level of pollinator specialization at each site; the observed pattern supports the "life-dinner principle" of selection acting more strongly on species with more at stake in the interaction. Similarly, plant mating system also affected the degree of trait correspondence because <b>selfing</b> <b>reduces</b> the reliance on pollinators and is analogous to pollination generalization. Conclusions Our analyses suggest that there are predictable "winners" and "losers" of evolutionary arms races and {{the results of this study}} highlight the fact that breeding system and the degree of specialization can influence the outcome. </p...|$|R
40|$|We have {{examined}} the effects of partial oxygen pressure and laser energy density on the electrical transport properties of thin LAO films grown on (100) TiO 2 -terminated SrTiO 3 substrates. Films were grown by pulsed laser deposition monitored by in-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED). Layer-by-layer growth, as indicated by clear RHEED oscillations, can be obtained {{in a wide range of}} oxygen partial pressures from 10 − 6 to 5 × 10 − 2 mbar. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis shows that the interface is coherent and atomically sharp for all deposition conditions. The STO substrate is oxygen <b>self</b> <b>reduced</b> at an oxygen pressure of 10 − 6 mbar and the electrical properties of the interface are dominated by the presence of oxygen vacancies. By increasing the oxygen pressure above 10 − 4 mbar, the substrate itself is insulating but the interface still shows metallic conductivity. However, the interface becomes insulating at an oxygen pressure of 5 × 10 − 2 mbar. We also found that the interface exhibits insulator-to-metal transition by changing the laser fluence during the deposition of the film. The interface prepared at 5 × 10 − 2 mbar shows metallic conductivity at high fluence, above 3. 5 J/cm 2...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{demonstrate}} {{and evaluate}} a modified simple method about self-reduction of anterior shoulder dislocation for {{significance in the}} emergency room. MethodsThe Boss-Holzach-Matter method for self-reduction of anterior shoulder disloaction is described. Patients with an anterior shoulder dislocation were retrospectively analysed concerning age, gender, type of anterior shoulder dislocation, occurrence of associated fractures, time between injury and reduction, reduction time, and method of reduction with its respective success rate. ResultsEighty-six patients (52 men, 34 women, mean age 49 years) were treated from January 2010 to June 2014. The reduction time ranged between 20 seconds and 6 min (mean 1. 5 min). Subcoracoid type of shoulder dislocation was seen in 72 cases (84 %), subglenoid type in 14 cases (16 %). Associated factures were seen in 20 cases, proportionally more often in subgleboid dislocations, 12 at the greater tuberosity, 6 at the inferior rim of the glenoid fossa and 2 at both localizations. The Boss-Holzach-Matter method was used in 35 cases with a success rate of 71. 5 %; die Kocher method and traction/countertraction method with premedication were used in 14 cases and 17 cases with success rates of 64 % and 70 %, respectively.
