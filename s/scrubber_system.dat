40|$|The {{removal of}} tar from the raw gas {{produced}} during biomass gasification is necessary before the gas {{can be used}} as a feedstock for synthetic fuels.

40|$|Dry Scrubbing is {{a common}} {{commercial}} process that has been limited to low- and medium-sulfur coal applications because high-sulfur coal requires more reagent than can be efficiently injected into the process.

This not only increases the amount of reagent that can be injected into the scrubber, but also increases SO{sub 2 } removal efficiency and sorbent utilization. The objectives of this project were to demonstrate, at pilot scale, that advanced, dry-scrubbing-based technologies can attain the performance levels specified by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments for SO{sub 2 } and NO{sub x} emissions while burning high-sulfur coal, and that these technologies are economically competitive with wet <b>scrubber</b> <b>systems.</b> The use of these technologies by utilities in and around Ohio, on new or retrofit applications, will ensure the future of markets for high-sulfur coal by creating cost effective options to coal switching...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Scrubber</b> <b>systems</b> (aka Chemical <b>Scrubbers,</b> Gas Scrubbers) are {{a diverse}} group of air {{pollution}} control devices {{that can be used to}} remove some particulates and/or gases from industrial exhaust streams.

Traditionally, the term [...] "scrubber" [...] has referred to pollution control devices that use liquid to wash unwanted pollutants from a gas stream. Recently, the term has also been used to describe systems that inject a dry reagent or slurry into a dirty exhaust stream to [...] "wash out" [...] acid gases. Scrubbers are one of the primary devices that control gaseous emissions, especially acid gases. Scrubbers can also be used for heat recovery from hot gases by flue-gas condensation.

These devices represent a subgroup of smoke hoods called positive-pressure respirators, which prevent the ingress of smoke or toxic gases by maintaining a higher air pressure inside the mask than outside. Consequently, any leak will cause fresh air to leak out of the mask, rather than toxic air to leak in.|$|E

40|$|Many {{gasification}} plants use <b>scrubber</b> <b>systems</b> for {{the removal}} of tars from producer gas. The cost of the scrubber liquid represents a considerable part of the operating cost, which could be decreased by regenerating the spent scrubber liquid by separating it from ash residues and heavy tars. In this study, different types of spent scrubber liquids were regenerated using a centrifuge. The effect of centrifugation time (1. 5 – 10 min) and sample temperature (50 – 90 °C) on the separation efficiency was studied. Based on the results, the separation of tars from the scrubber liquids can be ranked as follows: diesel > RME > linoleic acid > linseed oil > rapeseed oil > motor oil. This ranking correlates to the viscosity of the different scrubber liquids, with the separation efficiency increasing with decreasing scrubber liquid viscosity. The best separation efficiency was achieved for scrubber liquids with low viscosity at 90 °C and 10 min of centrifugation time. The results obtained indicate that centrifugation can be used for the regeneration of spent scrubber liquid...|$|R
