5|$|In 1894, the Chautauqua {{movement}} {{made its}} way to Gladstone. Judge Cross established a fifty-year lease of Gladstone Park for this event after he was convinced by Oregon City author Eva Emery Dye that doing <b>so</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a boon to the city and its people. Beginning on July 24–26, 1894, the newly formed Willamette Valley Chautauqua Association held an annual summer assembly that offered performances, lectures, and concerts. This event would reoccur annually, until Gladstone's Chautauqua Park grew to be the third-largest permanent Chautauqua assembly park in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In addition, if civil {{proceedings}} are taken against the Government, section 27 of the Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from granting injunctions against it. In place of an injunction, the Court {{may make a}} declaration concerning the parties' rights. The Court also may not make an injunction against a government officer if the effect of doing <b>so</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to provide relief {{that could not be}} obtained against the Government directly. Section 2(2) of the Act makes it clear that the term {{civil proceedings}} includes proceedings for judicial review.|$|E
50|$|For example, if multi-byte accesses must be 16 bit-aligned, {{addresses}} (given in bytes) at 0, 2, 4, 6, and <b>so</b> on <b>would</b> <b>be</b> considered aligned {{and therefore}} accessible, while addresses 1, 3, 5, and <b>so</b> on <b>would</b> <b>be</b> considered unaligned. Similarly, if multi-byte accesses must be 32-bit aligned, addresses 0, 4, 8, 12, and <b>so</b> on <b>would</b> <b>be</b> considered aligned and therefore accessible, and all addresses in between <b>would</b> <b>be</b> considered unaligned. Attempting to access a unit {{larger than a}} byte at an unaligned address can cause a bus error.|$|R

5|$|Under modern {{constitutional}} conventions, {{the sovereign}} acts {{on the advice}} of his or her ministers. Since these ministers most often enjoy the support of parliament and obtain the passage of bills, it is improbable that they would advise the sovereign to withhold assent. Hence, in modern practice, royal assent is always granted; a refusal to do <b>so</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> appropriate only in an emergency requiring the use of the monarch's reserve powers.|$|E
5|$|William Herschel {{discovered}} {{the first two}} moons, Titania and Oberon, in 1787, {{and the other three}} ellipsoidal moons were discovered in 1851 by William Lassell (Ariel and Umbriel) and in 1948 by Gerard Kuiper (Miranda). These five have planetary mass, and <b>so</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> considered (dwarf) planets if they were in direct orbit about the Sun. The remaining moons were discovered after 1985, either during the Voyager 2 flyby mission or with the aid of advanced Earth-based telescopes.|$|E
5|$|Amompharetus: The {{leader of}} a {{battalion}} of Spartans, he refused to undertake the night-time retreat towards Plataea before the battle, since doing <b>so</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> shameful for a Spartan. Herodotus has an angry debate continuing between Pausanias and Amompharetus until dawn, whereupon {{the rest of the}} Spartan army finally began to retreat, leaving Amompharetus' division behind. Not expecting this, Amompharetus eventually led his men after the retreating Spartans. However, another tradition remembers Amompharetus as winning great renown at Plataea, and it has thus been suggested that Amompharetus, far from being insubordinate, had instead volunteered to guard the rear.|$|E

The simpler alkyl radical is written in front, <b>so</b> CH3–O–CH2CH3 <b>would</b> <b>be</b> given as methoxy(CH3O)ethane(CH2CH3).|$|R
5|$|Of Jupiter's moons, eight are regular {{satellites}} with prograde {{and nearly}} circular orbits {{that are not}} greatly inclined with respect to Jupiter's equatorial plane. The Galilean satellites are nearly spherical in shape due to their planetary mass, and <b>so</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> considered (dwarf) planets {{if they were in}} direct orbit around the Sun. The other four regular satellites are much smaller and closer to Jupiter; these serve as sources of the dust that makes up Jupiter's rings. The remainder of Jupiter's moons are irregular satellites whose prograde and retrograde orbits are much farther from Jupiter and have high inclinations and eccentricities. These moons were probably captured by Jupiter from solar orbits. Eighteen of the irregular satellites have not yet been named.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} to his bush camp, Wilson sent a further message to the laager, which reached its destination at around 23:00: Napier, Scout Bain and Trooper Robertson were the men acting as runners. Wilson repeated {{that he was going}} to stay north of the river overnight, close to the king, and asked Forbes to bring the whole column across by 04:00 in the morning. Forbes thought it unwise to attempt a full river crossing at night, which he reasoned might lead to his force being surrounded in the darkness and massacred, but also felt he could not recall Wilson, as to do <b>so</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to lose Lobengula for sure.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{sought to}} bring near-universal health {{insurance}} coverage to the state. This came after Staples founder Tom Stemberg told him {{at the start of}} his term that doing <b>so</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the best way he could help people. Another factor was that the federal government, owing to the rules of Medicaid funding, threatened to cut $385million in those payments to Massachusetts if the state did not reduce the number of uninsured recipients of health care services. Although the idea of universal health insurance had not come to the fore during the campaign, Romney decided that because people without insurance still received expensive health care, the money spent by the state for such care could be better used to subsidize insurance for the poor.|$|E

5|$|Series creator David Wolstencroft {{believed}} that writing Tom {{was the most}} fun, yet the hardest work compared with other characters, because he was Spooks primary protagonist. Wolstencroft chose a job in Information Technology (IT) as the cover story Tom used in his relationship with Ellie, because he felt that in real life people are reluctant {{to ask questions about}} IT work. To portray the character, actor Matthew Macfadyen followed the scripts, {{and did not want to}} deviate from them, as he did not believe doing <b>so</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> useful. Macfadyen was also keen to explore parts of Tom from within him for influence.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the bullet had been. By looking through the rear hole in the head, through the front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and <b>so</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> looking directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E
5|$|In response, the {{legislature}} published the revisions on its own, effectively creating {{a situation of}} dual constitutions. As {{there was not a}} quorum, the Supreme Court was unable to act. To solve the situation, the legislators appointed six new justices, but the Court still refused to act, as doing <b>so</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> to accept the appointments and thus validate the new constitution. Chamorro choreographed a ruling from the Supreme Court which voided the Assembly's publication of the reforms, provoking the Assembly to refuse to acknowledge the Court's authority. As international investors began to fret over the ensuing instability and evaluate further aid, the Roman Catholic cardinal, Miguel Obando y Bravo, stepped in as mediator and brokered an accord. Chamorro agreed to publish the new constitution, as required by law, and the assembly agreed to allow the president to continue to negotiate foreign aid and tax measures, though no longer by decree. One of the most contentious provisions, the one banning nepotism was conceded by Chamorro. Both sides claimed victory, though the Supreme Court issue was still not resolved with the Assembly insisting their appointees were valid and the President refusing to acknowledge them.|$|E

5|$|While the Giro had in its peloton many notable riders, {{including}} six former Grand Tour winners, the odds-on favorite was always 's Alberto Contador. The 2008 Giro champion, who had likewise won the 2008 Vuelta a España and three {{editions of the}} Tour de France, announced in April 2010 that he would contest the Giro in 2011. Though his status was put in doubt after a positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France, he was cleared by his national federation in February 2011 and {{able to return to}} racing, though the case still pended a final appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport later in 2011. Contador was the overwhelming favorite for overall victory. Reigning Giro champion Ivan Basso chose not to return, preferring to focus on the Tour de France later in the season. He briefly considered riding as a domestique for Vincenzo Nibali, but opted against it because of his physical condition at the time and the feeling that doing <b>so</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> disrespectful to the race. The 2011 Giro was thus the third successive edition, and fourth in the last five, in which the reigning champion did not return to defend his championship.|$|E
