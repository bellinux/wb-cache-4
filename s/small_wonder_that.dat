2500|$|Barry Garron of The Hollywood Reporter {{suggested}} that with [...] "such thin stories... it's <b>small</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> {{sex and violence}} are used {{to take up the}} slack." [...] Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times wrote that John Hannah as Batiatus [...] "keeps the show grounded with a persuasive portrait of a man engaged in a stressful daily business." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Small</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that,</b> as Bruni {{continues}} {{writing songs}} for her fourth album, due in 2011, her team is contemplating {{how to balance}} her musical career with her status as first lady of France. That status caused problems when Bruni's third album, [...] "Comme Si De Rien N'etait", was released in July 2008, five months after she married Sarkozy.|$|E
2500|$|Newkirk is {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of direct action that removes animals from laboratories and other facilities—she told The Los Angeles Times in 1992 that when she hears of anyone walking into a lab and walking out with animals, her heart sings. Newkirk commented to the Chronicle of Higher Education in 1999, [...] "When you see the resistance to basic humane treatment and to the acknowledgment of animals' social needs, I find it <b>small</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> the laboratories aren't all burning to the ground. If I had more guts, I'd light a match." ...|$|E
60|$|Yet {{since the}} death of Edward VI he had not been seen at Court. <b>Small</b> <b>wonder,</b> therefore, <b>that</b> at sight of the Duke all four men seemed amazed.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>small</b> <b>wonder,</b> therefore, <b>that</b> both gave a loud cry {{of alarm}} {{and that both}} caught at the lines to lead Billy away from the danger so imminent.|$|R
50|$|Simple Living: JVC Northwest {{challenges}} each {{volunteer to}} live a simple and reflective lifestyle, an alternative way to living in a consumer society. JVC Northwest stresses spiritual values over material possessions and invites volunteers to integrate their faith by working and living among those who experience poverty and oppression. This helps volunteers to experience {{the lives of those}} with whom they interact on a daily basis and to raise their consciousness to the human needs surrounding them. Often, volunteers find that living simply opens them up to a more joyful way of life, appreciating <b>small</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>that</b> often go unnoticed in everyday life.|$|R
6000|$|... "And 'tis <b>small</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> Ursula should wish {{to catch}} sight of the man whom her father vowed she should wed or else enter into a convent," [...] {{concluded}} Alicia defiantly.|$|E
60|$|With so much {{excitement}} going on, it was <b>small</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> the Rover party did {{not come}} downstairs that morning until quite late. Sam {{was the first to}} show himself, he being anxious to know how Grace had fared.|$|E
60|$|It was <b>small</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> Allen gave a yell. He {{knew the}} {{reptiles}} were, many of them, poisonous, {{and he had}} not the first thing with which to defend himself. He leaped back to retreat, but only to find himself surrounded.|$|E
5000|$|In 1986, Alden {{arrived to}} the taping of the {{television}} program <b>Small</b> <b>Wonder,</b> not realizing <b>that</b> the episode had been co-written by his cousin Jack Gross ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Small</b> <b>wonder,</b> then, <b>that,</b> Bret Harte {{no matter}} how unconsciously, should have adopted here and there {{something}} of the style {{and some of the}} mannerisms of Dickens. This is directly traceable in his writings, even to the extent of his resorting, here and there, to oddities of expression which were peculiarly Dickensian.|$|R
60|$|Both {{apparently}} {{forgot the}} spectators in their mutual surprise, though Lucille Haldane {{stared at them}} wide-eyed, which was <b>small</b> <b>wonder,</b> considering <b>that</b> she was a romantic girl forced {{for the first time}} to play a part in what threatened to prove an unpleasantly realistic tragedy. It was hardly possible for her not to guess that these two had been friends in very different circumstances.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! {{you come}} from the country, master? ... So delightful, of a truth.... Milk for breakfast, eh? ... You get up at dawn {{and go to bed}} at sunset? ... I know country life well--though alas! duty now keeps me in town.... But 'tis <b>small</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> you look so young!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Small</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> the ingenious Colonel Bishop, who so well {{understood}} {{the art of}} loosening stubborn tongues, had not deemed it necessary to have recourse to other means of torture. Not all his fiendish cruelty could devise a torment more cruel, more unendurable than the torments Nature would here procure a man in Pitt's condition.|$|E
6000|$|It {{seems that}} you leave trouble outside--in {{charge of the}} hall-porter, one supposes. He ties it up for you as the Commissionaire of the Army and Navy Stores ties up your dog. If you want it again, you ask for it as you come out. <b>Small</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> the [...] "Court" [...] and [...] "Mansion" [...] are growing in {{popularity}} every day.|$|E
60|$|The {{place was}} {{on the top of}} a high hill, backed up by still higher mountains. On every hand were sharp rocks and trees, with a tangle of thorns. <b>Small</b> <b>wonder,</b> then, <b>that</b> Aguinaldo and his cohorts {{considered}} these fastnesses inaccessible for American troops. No regular body could have gotten to such a place, and to forward supplies hither was totally out of the question.|$|R
60|$|<b>Small</b> <b>wonder,</b> therefore, <b>that</b> {{the romantic}} and mysterious {{personality}} of the Scarlet Pimpernel {{was a source of}} bitter hatred to Chauvelin. He and the few young jackanapes under his command, well furnished with money, armed with boundless daring, and acute cunning, had succeeded in rescuing hundreds of aristocrats from France. Nine-tenths of the EMIGRES, who were FETED at the English court, owed their safety to that man and to his league.|$|R

[...] It is <b>small</b> <b>wonder</b> then <b>that</b> we are seeing a whole new generation of blacks come up in America who have little moral conviction." [...] (1985) ...|$|R
60|$|But {{already she}} had {{recovered}} from this sudden attack of faintness and dizziness, of which, with characteristic impatience for all feminine weaknesses, {{she was now}} thoroughly ashamed. Her nervous system had received so many severe shocks {{in the course of}} this terrible and memorable day, that it was <b>small</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> this last awful blow struck her physically as well as mentally.|$|E
60|$|There {{are many}} portraits and miniatures extant of Marguerite St. Just--Lady Blakeney {{as she was}} then--but it is {{doubtful}} {{if any of these}} really do her singular beauty justice. Tall, above the average, with magnificent presence and regal figure, it is <b>small</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> even the Comtesse paused for a moment in involuntary admiration before turning her back on so fascinating an apparition.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it <b>small</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that,</b> though ill-feeling {{against the}} Earl of Brockelsby {{may have been}} deep, there was hatred, bitter, deadly hatred against the man who with false {{promises}} had led him into so hopeless a quagmire? Probably the Hon. Robert owed {{a great deal of}} money to Beddingfield, which the latter hoped to recoup at usurious interest, with threats of scandal and what not.|$|E

All of them had socialist leaning,” Saqi told The News.|$|R

60|$|They {{were both}} smiling, yet with an {{underlying}} credulity and seriousness as singularly pathetic {{as it seemed}} incongruous to their years and intelligence. <b>Small</b> <b>wonder,</b> however, <b>that</b> in their occupation and environment--living daily {{in an atmosphere of}} hope, expectation, and chance, looking forward each morning to the blind stroke of a pick that might bring fortune--they should see signs in nature and hear mystic voices in the trackless woods that surrounded them. Still less strange that they were peculiarly susceptible to the more recognized diversions of chance, and were gamblers on the turning of a card who trusted to the revelation of a shovelful of upturned earth.|$|R
6000|$|The {{next day}} she changed billets with E11, who had the luck {{to pick up and}} put down a {{battleship}} close to Gallipoli. It {{turned out to be the}} Barbarossa. Meantime E14 got a 5000-ton supply ship, and later had to burn a sailing ship loaded with 200 bales of leaf and cut tobacco--Turkish tobacco! <b>Small</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> E11 [...] "came alongside that afternoon and remained for an hour"--probably making cigarettes.|$|E
60|$|Although in this circle--known as the Queen's set--the young Marchioness of Eglinton {{had always}} been looked up to as a leader and an especial favourite, the {{accusation}} which Irène had brought against her was so awful, her own attitude of passive acquiescence so incomprehensible, that it was <b>small</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> after the departure of Their Majesties, when the crowd broke up into isolated groups, most people there present held themselves aloof from her.|$|E
60|$|And the red wrath {{was up in}} me, ripping {{and tearing}} at my will to be free. <b>Small</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> I shook with the effort to control. The shaking, happily, they took for the {{weakness}} of age. I held up my brass begging bowl, and whined more dolefully, and bleared my eyes to hide the blue fire I knew was in them, and calculated the distance and my strength for the leap.|$|E
60|$|It {{had been}} stipulated that the prisoners' lives be spared, yet when {{the capture of}} the Goliad {{garrison}} was reported to General Santa Anna he instantly sent word {{that all of the}} prisoners should be taken out and shot! The command was an infamous one, yet it was obeyed almost to the letter, only a handful of the Texans escaping out of about three hundred. <b>Small</b> <b>wonder</b> was it <b>that</b> Santa Anna was often termed the Mexican butcher.|$|R
40|$|Before {{going into}} the proper matter of this paper {{it might not be}} out of place to say a few things about Abyssinia generally. That area of greater Ethiopia conquered by the Italians in their 1935 Campaign {{comprises}} roughly 350 000 square miles and can be considered the Jewel of Northern Africa - bounded as it is on one side by the flat desert-like country of Italian Somaliland and on the other by the bleak, desolate and inhospitable mountains of Eritrea. <b>Small</b> <b>wonder</b> therefore <b>that</b> the Italians for years had an eye on Abyssinia which for hundreds of miles on end consists of green mountains and rolling valleys covered with grass, generally presenting scenery which in some spots surpasses Switzerland and the Grand Canyon of Colorado...|$|R
60|$|It is <b>small</b> <b>wonder,</b> then, <b>that</b> the {{announcement}} of his candidature was received with passionate enthusiasm. Mine, on the contrary, evoked a chorus of disapproval, that is, in the local press. I was denounced as an adventurer, {{as a man who}} had stood a criminal trial for wicked negligence, and escaped the jail only by the skin of my teeth. I was held up to public reprobation as a Socialist, who, having nothing myself, wished to prey upon the goods of others, and as an anti-vaccination quack who, to gain a few votes, was ready to infest the whole community with a loathsome disease. Of all the accusations of my opponents this {{was the only one that}} stung me, because it alone had truth in it.|$|R
60|$|The redmen {{were driven}} like hounded deer into the untrodden wilds. From freemen of the forests, from {{owners of the}} great {{boundless}} plains, they passed to stern, enduring fugitives on their own lands. <b>Small</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> they became cruel where once they had been gentle! Stratagem and cunning, the night assault, the daylight ambush took the place of their one-time open warfare. Their chivalrous courage, that sublime inheritance from ancestors who had never known the paleface foe, degenerated into a savage ferocity.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a lovely}} night. The moon swung low, and languished softly on the snowy ridge beyond. There were quaint odors in the still air; and a strange incense from the woods perfumed their young blood, and seemed to swoon in their pulses. <b>Small</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> they lingered on the white road, that their feet climbed, unwillingly the little hill where they were to part, and that, when they at last reached it, even the saving grace of speech seemed to have forsaken them.|$|E
60|$|Entering headquarters, Stephen {{paused at}} {{the doorway of the}} big room where the {{officers}} of the different staffs were scattered about, smoking, while the negro servants were removing the dishes from the table. The sunlight, reflected from the rippling water outside, danced on the ceiling. At the end of the room sat General Sherman, his uniform, as always, a trifle awry. His soft felt hat with the gold braid was tilted forward, and his feet, booted and spurred, were crossed. <b>Small</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>that</b> the Englishman who sought the typical American found him in Sherman.|$|E
5000|$|An ardent sports fan, Marqusee won {{considerable}} renown for {{his work}} on cricket. War Minus the Shooting, his book on the 1996 Cricket World Cup, has been lauded as a [...] "riveting, revelatory and largely run-free account". [...] Before it was published, wrote Rob Steen, [...] "observations of subcontinental cricket emanating from Britain, and just about every other corner of the so-called old world, tended to be clichéd, wrongheaded, derisive, patronising or just plain racist. <b>Small</b> <b>wonder,</b> then, <b>that</b> it took a London-based American with a rucksack, a notebook and a CLR Jamesian yen for Marxism to supply an overdue corrective." [...] Duncan Campbell of The Guardian wrote that [...] "One of the best books ever written on cricket, Anyone But England, is by an American writer, Mike Marqusee." ...|$|R
5000|$|DKJ’s first formal guru was his {{own sister}} Sangeetha Kalanidhi D.K. Pattammal to whom, he declares, he owes everything. But having a keen mind, he absorbed a lot by just {{listening}} to Vidwans like Ambi Dikshitar, N.S. Krishnaswamy Iyengar ( [...] disciple of Naina Pillai) Koteeswara Iyer, Flute Venkatarama Iyer, T. L. Venkatrama Iyer and Papanasam Sivan, when they came home to coach Pattammal. DKJ was perpetually thirsty for knowledge. He once pestered DKP to write down the words of Balagopala kriti for him. Where other children cherished their wooden toys or rocking horses, DKJ’s prized possession was that bit of paper containing the great piece. He mastered the kriti over night and rendered it perfectly {{the next day to}} an astonished but appreciative DKP. <b>Small</b> <b>wonder</b> then, <b>that</b> DKP fostered her younger brother‘s musical talent right from a tender age.|$|R
60|$|The hounds were my especial delight. But Jones {{regarded}} {{them with}} considerable contempt. When all was said, {{this was no}} <b>small</b> <b>wonder,</b> for <b>that</b> quintet of long-eared canines would have tried the patience of a saint. Old Moze was a Missouri hound that Jones had procured in that State of uncertain qualities; and the dog had grown old over coon-trails. He was black and white, grizzled and battlescarred; and if ever a dog had an evil eye, Moze was that dog. He {{had a way of}} wagging his tail--an indeterminate, equivocal sort of wag, as if he realized his ugliness and knew he stood little chance of making friends, but was still hopeful and willing. As for me, the first time he manifested this evidence of a good heart under a rough coat, he won me forever.|$|R
