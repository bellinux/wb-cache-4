25|$|Major-General Rupert Downes, {{who was the}} Army's most <b>senior</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officer</b> as the Director General of Medical Services, {{arrived in}} the UK shortly before the {{outbreak}} of war in 1939. During his visit to London, he secured the services of two eminent Australian physicians, the surgeon Sir Thomas Dunhill and Neil Hamilton Fairley, to serve as technical advisers to the Army. During the early period of the war these two men provided valuable advice to the Australian Army, including by passing on copies of medical literature and personal accounts of war surgery and treatments. In addition, Dunhill mentored Australian surgeons who were either working in the UK or were sent there during the war to gain experience. Shortly after the outbreak of war in September 1939, a medical liaison officer was also posted to the High Commission. This officer reported on new developments in medical treatments, and helped to facilitate orders of medical equipment for the Army.|$|E
25|$|Lindemann {{remained}} on edge. As captain, he was {{privy to the}} B-Dienst naval intelligence now reaching him on enemy movements. A large contingent of enemy capital ships was congregating at Scapa Flow. His <b>senior</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officer,</b> Dr. Otto Schneider, observed that Lindemann fully understood the dangers his ship faced. But Admiral Lütjens alone could call off the operation. He showed no desire to discuss his intentions with either Captain Lindemann or Brinkmann, which put both of them on edge. Lütjens offered no hint of intentions either to his destroyer escort, which he dismissed near Trondheim, or to Generaladmiral Carls. Carls openly displayed his displeasure {{at the lack of}} communication, believing Lütjens to be hesitant. Not until the evening of 22 May did he share his intention to breach the Denmark Strait with his captains; perhaps encouraged in the knowledge that the British Force H would now be engaged in the beginning Battle of Crete. The foul weather gave him the cover he needed. Foregoing the chance of a refuel, he headed due west, north of Iceland.|$|E

Also in attendance at that meeting were, Dr. Sidney Herbert Reginald Lucy, Acting <b>Senior</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Officer,</b> Penang, Dr. George Williamson Park, Municipal Health Officer, and Mr. David Beatty, Acting Assistant Protector of Chinese, were in attendance. The Chamber desired the Government to allow any member from an imported port to land provided he produces a certificate of membership, with his photograph affixed; and that that its members may be allowed to stand security for the daily appearance of any passenger before the Municipal Health Officer. In both cases the member guaranteeing his own or any one else's appearance will pay a penalty of $100 in default. The deputation had been appointed {{to explain to the}} Resident Councillor the Chamber's request that its certificate of membership should be recognised as a sufficient guarantee to permit of the landing of a passenger from an infected port. Bland requested the deputation to supply further particulars concerning the constitution of the Chamber before giving his reply. They were not heard from again.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Telemedicine has revolutionised {{the ability}} to provide care to patients, relieve {{professional}} isolation and provide guidance and supervision to junior <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> in rural areas. This study evaluated the Townsville teleoncology supervision model for the training of junior <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> in rural areas of North Queensland, Australia. Specifically, the perspectives of junior and <b>senior</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> were explored to identify recommendations for future implementation. Design: A qualitative approach incorporating observation and semistructured interviews was used to collect data. Interviews were uploaded into NVivo 10 data management software. Template analysis enabled themes to be tested and developed through consensus between researchers. Setting: One tertiary level and four secondary level healthcare centres in rural and regional Queensland, Australia. Participants: 10 junior <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> (Interns, Registrars) and 10 <b>senior</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> (<b>Senior</b> <b>Medical</b> <b>Officers,</b> Consultants) {{who participated in the}} Townsville teleoncology model of remote supervision via videoconference (TTMRS) were included in the study. Primary and Secondary outcome measures: Perspectives on the telemedicine experience, technology, engagement, professional support, satisfaction and limitations were examined. Perspectives on topics raised by participants were also examined as the interviews progressed. Results: Four major themes with several subthemes emerged from the data: learning environment, beginning the learning relationship, stimulus for learning and practicalities of remote supervision via videoconference. While some themes were consistent with the current literature, new themes like increased professional edge, recognising non-verbal cues and physical examination challenges were identified. Conclusions: Remote supervision via videoconference provides readily available guidance to trainees supporting their delivery of appropriate care to patients. However, resources required for upskilling, training in the use of supervision via videoconference, administration issues and nursing support, as well as physical barriers to examinations, must be addressed to enable more efficient implementation. ...|$|R
25|$|After {{successful}} completion of the MBBS course, one has to compulsorily work in the hospital attached to the medical college {{or in any other}} approved hospital allowed in some medical colleges, for a period of one year. This posting is called the Compulsory Rotatory Residential Internship or the House Surgeon in Tamil Nadu. The student gets the degree only after satisfactory completion of the CRRI. An Intern (also called an Internee or a CRRI) is posted in all the clinical departments of the hospital on a rotation basis. This gives him or her the basic clinical and practical knowledge about all the disciplines of medicine and makes the medical graduate fit to work in the community as a General Physician. The schedules of an intern is usually extremely exhaustive. For example, one may have to work for the whole night and then have to start the next day duty only after about one or two hours. This may last till the afternoon. 24-hour sleepless duty at a stretch is not uncommon and sometimes the scheduled breaks are also not allowed by the superiors. He or she is also paid a monthly stipend for his work in the hospital which differs in different medical colleges {{on the basis of the}} management. The person is licensed to practice medicine only after completion of this internship. And only after finishing internship, one can receive his MBBS degree and can pursue postgraduate studies. The Interns are entrusted with clinical responsibilities under the supervision of a Medical teacher or a Resident/ PGT/ <b>Senior</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officer.</b> Interns are not supposed to issue medical certificates, death certificates or medico-legal documents under their own signatures.|$|E

500|$|The crew's {{bodies were}} {{initially}} examined by <b>senior</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officer,</b> Surgeon-Captain Richard [...] "Rick" [...] Jolly of the Royal Navy. The helicopter's wreckage was inspected on-site, but the British {{were unable to}} determine {{if it had been}} destroyed by Cardiffs missiles or by Argentine fire. This uncertainty prompted the decision not to hold a board of inquiry, and XX377 was declared [...] "lost in action". It was surmised that, if the relatives of the deceased were told that the Gazelle might have been lost to friendly fire, it would add to their grief. After the war, missile fragments found in the wreckage were taken to the British government's aviation research facility at RAE Farnborough for analysis. The scientific tests concluded that the fragments were not from a British Sea Dart missile, despite a Sea Dart casing later being found [...] "several hundred yards" [...] away from the wreckage.|$|E
500|$|On 20 August 1934 Downes became Director General of Medical Services (DGMS), a {{full-time}} post and the Army's most <b>senior</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officer.</b> His priority was a recruiting campaign {{to increase the}} number of medical professionals in the Army. [...] The Munich Crisis caused people to believe that another war was imminent, and an Army-wide recruiting campaign led by Major General Sir Thomas Blamey doubled the size of the Army from 35,000 in 1938 to 70,000 in 1939. Downes' efforts at recruiting were far more modest. In 1934, there were 299 part-time officers in the AAMC; by 1939 there were 394, and increase of only 32 per cent. This included 320 medical practitioners, 37 dentists and 13 pharmacists. Downes was acutely aware that a large Army would require mobilisation of the country's doctors, and pushed for all doctors to be prepared for either military service or direction by civil authorities. He presided over a major effort to stockpile drugs and medical equipment required for a mobilisation. With the help of the Department of Health and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, most of this was delivered by July 1939.|$|E
