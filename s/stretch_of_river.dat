5|$|The Environment Agency in 2008 {{classified}} {{the river}} as Grade A (highest grade) for chemical content, but the biology was assessed at C grade (mid). Measurements were taken over a <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> between Bradley brook and Broomhill.|$|E
5|$|Most of the three-mile (5km) <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> {{that had}} {{previously}} been closed was reopened without restriction, although a patrol remained in place to enforce a safety zone. The river restrictions delayed one outgoing vessel and two incoming ones. There was also a minor oil spill originating from equipment at the refinery's unoccupied and rarely used dock.|$|E
5|$|The common {{hippopotamus}} inhabits rivers, lakes and mangrove swamps, where territorial bulls preside over a <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> {{and groups of}} five to thirty females and young. During the day, they remain cool by staying in the water or mud; reproduction and childbirth both occur in water. They emerge at dusk to graze on grasses. While hippopotamuses rest near {{each other in the}} water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos are not territorial on land. The hippopotamus is a highly aggressive and unpredictable animal and has attacked humans. They are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their meat and ivory canine teeth.|$|E

5|$|A railway from Grantham to Sleaford {{opened in}} 1857. This was {{extended}} to Boston in 1859, and so offered direct competition to the navigation. The decline was rapid. Income fell from £981 in 1858 to £168 in 1868, and the share price dropped from £40 to £10 between 1860 and 1863. The company was trading at a loss by 1871, and although an Act of Abandonment was obtained on 17 June 1878, the navigation did not actually close until 14 May 1881, which was also {{the date of the}} final meeting of the proprietors. The Act required the company to fill in the three locks nearest to Sleaford, but there were special provisions for the remaining structures. The next three were on a <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> bordered by land belonging to Haverholme Priory, and were to be put into good order and handed over to Murray Finch Hatton, earl of Winchilsea & Nottingham, who owned the Priory. He could then maintain or abandon them, but was required to construct sluices if he chose to abandon them. The final lock was to be handed over to the commissioners of the River Witham, once it was in good order, and they could remove the gates and fill in the lock if they chose to do so.|$|E
5|$|Landward {{movement}} of the shingle meant that the channel of the Glaven was becoming blocked increasingly often by 2004. This led to flooding of Cley village and the environmentally important Blakeney freshwater marshes. The Environment Agency considered several remedial options. It concluded that attempting {{to hold back the}} shingle or breaching the spit to create a new outlet for the Glaven would be expensive and probably ineffective, and doing nothing would be environmentally damaging. The Agency decided to create a new route for the river to the south of its original line, and work to realign a 550m (600yd) <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> 200m (220yd) further south was completed in 2007 {{at a cost of about}} £1.5million. The Glaven had previously been realigned from an earlier, more northerly, course in 1922. The ruins of Blakeney Chapel are now to the north of the river embankment, and essentially unprotected from coastal erosion, since the advancing shingle will no longer be swept away by the stream. The chapel will be buried by a ridge of shingle as the spit continues to move south, and then lost to the sea, perhaps within 20–30years.|$|E
25|$|Where {{a longer}} cut {{bypasses}} a circuitous <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>river,</b> the upstream {{end of the}} cut will often be protected by a flood lock.|$|E

50|$|The <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>river</b> {{between the}} {{junction}} with the Oder-Havel Canal near Liebenwalde and the confluence with the River Spree at Spandau is administered {{as part of}} the Havel-Oder-Wasserstraße, which also includes the Oder-Havel Canal. This <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>river</b> forms part <b>of</b> the main inland waterway route from Germany to Poland and carries significant commercial traffic. This <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>river</b> is 40 km long, and the river descends through two locks at Lehnitz and Spandau.|$|R
25|$|The Hereford Rowing Club (along {{with the}} Kayak Club) uses the River Wye; it {{is a popular}} club with a junior group. The <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> is also used for other water sports.|$|E
25|$|When a <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> is made navigable, a lock is {{sometimes}} required to bypass an obstruction {{such as a}} rapid, dam, or mill weir – because {{of the change in}} river level across the obstacle.|$|E
25|$|The Mole {{catchment}} area includes twelve Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) which include wetland habitats and the <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> through Leatherhead {{has been designated}} a Local Nature Reserve.

50|$|Many {{industries}} in Kaikorai Valley discharge waste {{water into the}} stream. The industrial area here is one <b>of</b> the few <b>stretches</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> with esplanade reserves (providing public access) along its banks.|$|R
50|$|Gallions Reach is a <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>River</b> Thames between Woolwich and Thamesmead. There {{are various}} {{locations}} {{on both sides}} <b>of</b> the <b>river</b> named after Gallions Reach. The area is named for the Galyons, a 14th-century family who owned property along this <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>river.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{uppermost}} <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>river</b> {{through the}} centre of Zurich is navigable by rather larger vessels, albeit limited by low bridges. On this <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> the <b>river</b> the Zürichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft (Lake Zurich Navigation Company) operates its Limmat boat service, from the Landesmuseum to Lake Zurich, using low-profile motor boats.|$|R
25|$|The whole twenty-six miles was {{sometimes}} called The Suck, and the <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> was notorious enough to merit mention even by Thomas Jefferson. These navigational hazards were so formidable, in fact, that the French agents attempting to travel upriver to reach Cherokee country during the French and Indian War, intending {{to establish an}} outpost at the spot later occupied by British agent McDonald, gave up after several attempts.|$|E
25|$|In {{large scale}} river {{navigation}} improvements, weirs and locks are used together. A weir {{will increase the}} depth of a shallow stretch, and the required lock will either be built in {{a gap in the}} weir, or at the downstream end of an artificial cut which bypasses the weir and perhaps a shallow <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> below it. A river improved by these means is often called a Waterway or River Navigation (see example Calder and Hebble Navigation).|$|E
25|$|In recent times, Inland Waterways Authority of India has {{declared}} the <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> Ganges between Allahabad and Haldia National Inland Waterway {{and has taken}} steps to restore and maintain its navigability. The National Waterway-1, the longest Waterway in India, stretches 1620km in the River Ganga from Allahabad to Haldia via Varanasi, Munger, Bhagalpur passes through Patna. This National Waterways has fixed terminal at Patna. In September 2014, a luxury cruise called ‘MV Rajmahal’ from Patna to Varanasi was launched by the state-based Assam Bengal Navigation Company (ABN).|$|E

50|$|For {{much of its}} history, OULRC trained {{outside of}} Oxford, {{variously}} at Radley (downstream) and at Godstow (upstream). This was necessary due to the congestion on the Isis, {{as well as the}} need for long <b>stretches</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> on which to do endurance training.|$|R
25|$|Over {{a period}} of about 24 hours on March 7, 1876, the Mississippi River {{abandoned}} its former channel that coincided with the Tennessee-Arkansas border, and established a new channel east of Reverie. This places Reverie on the Arkansas side, while most of the area of Tipton County is located east of the Mississippi River, the Tennessee side. The formation of the new Centennial Cut-off, named for the US centennial, and the abandonment of the <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> formerly known as the Devil's Elbow, led to a 1918 Supreme Court case on whether the border should be moved with the river.|$|E
25|$|Attainment {{of sexual}} {{maturity}} in Tarebia granifera is generally {{indicated by the}} size of the smallest snail observed to give birth rather than a histological assessment of the development of the gonad and associated reproductive structures. Appleton & Nadasan (2002) estimated onset of maturity at 10–12mm shell height but unpublished data suggest a height closer to 8mm in line with other published studies. Tucker Abbott (1952) estimated sexual maturity at between 5.5 and 8.0mm at different stations over a short <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> in Florida. Chaniotis et al. (1980) gave a similar estimate of 6.0-7.0mm from a cohort of laboratory-bred snails in Puerto Rico.|$|E
25|$|Intensive artisanal fishing, mainly gillnetting {{but also}} line and electrofishing, {{occurs in the}} <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> where the sole Irrawaddy river shark {{specimen}} was caught. Habitat degradation poses a further threat to this shark, including water pollution and the clearing of mangrove trees for fuel, construction materials, and other products. This shark may be naturally rare, which along with its highly restricted range, probable overfishing, and loss of habitat, has led the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to list it as Critically Endangered. Despite fishing and scientific surveys in the area, no more Irrawaddy river sharks have been recorded in the hundred-plus years since the first.|$|E
50|$|The Oblate Order {{with the}} local {{leadership}} of Bishop Grouard started constructing their own fleet of riverboats, one each for isolated <b>stretches</b> <b>of</b> <b>river.</b> The order included skilled carpenters, who constructed the riverboats, on-site, from local timber. The engines were shipped from eastern Canada.|$|R
50|$|Damselfishes {{comprise}} the family Pomacentridae except {{those of the}} genera Amphiprion and Premnas, which are the anemonefishes. They can grow up to 14 in long. While most are marine, a few species inhabit the lower <b>stretches</b> <b>of</b> <b>rivers</b> in fresh water. Damselfish usually have bright colors.|$|R

25|$|To {{the west}} of the Utina, in the area around present-day Gainesville, were the Potano, another Timucua group who were enemies of the Utina. Down the St. Johns to the north, in an area {{stretching}} roughly from what is now downtown Jacksonville to the mouth of the river, were another enemy tribe, the Saturiwa. The <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> between about Palatka and Jacksonville was relatively less populated, and may have served as a boundary between the Utina and the Saturiwa. Up the river south of Lake George were the Mayaca tribe, who were culturally similar to the Utina but did not speak the Timucua language and were more closely aligned with the Ais tribe of the Atlantic coast.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} {{proposals}} {{to extend the}} navigation upstream from Alveston to a link with the Grand Union Canal at either Warwick or Leamington Spa. This was first considered by the Severn Trent Water Authority in 1974, who conducted a survey, the cost of which was partly funded by the Inland Waterways Association. This would open up a <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>river</b> that has never previously been navigable, but the proposal has not been universally welcomed. Landowners at Warwick Castle and Charlecote Park have attempted to claim the river as private property, although the 1636 Orders of Council state that the river was free to Coventry. Despite much local support, {{there is still some}} opposition to the scheme.|$|E
25|$|Three of {{the five}} other {{hydroelectric}} systems were located in proximity {{to each other in}} South Hamgyong Province north of Hungnam. Each consisted of four plants 5–10 miles (8–16km) apart along a thirty-mile (50km) <b>stretch</b> <b>of</b> <b>river,</b> numbered by planners as 1 through 4, with plant 1 closest to its respective reservoir. The northernmost, the Kyosen (P'ungsan) system, was on the Namdae Ch'on with its terminus at Tanch'on. The Fusen (Pujǒn) system was due north of Hungnam on the Songch'on-gang, with its four plants close together but in mountain gorges. The Choshin (Changjin) ran south and then east in the mountain canyons from the Chosin Reservoir and connected with the Songch'on-gang south of Fusen Plant No. 4.|$|E
