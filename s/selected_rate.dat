40|$|Direct Internal Reforming (DIR) on Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) anodes {{is often}} {{considered}} for fuel cells systems utilising carbon based fuels. Methane Steam Reforming (MSR) {{is one of}} the most extensively studied types of DIR. The hydrogen formed by the MSR reaction can be electrochemically oxidised in the fuel cell to produce electricity, while the exothermic electrochemical reaction supplies heat to the endothermic MSR reaction. The balance is delicate and unsuitable design choices will result in operational problems and poor fuel cell performance. These issues are known for over two decades now and remain unsolved despite several attempts to capture the rate limiting kinetics of the reforming process on fuel cell anodes and modelling studies of methane fuelled SOFCs. It is not yet clear whether MSR kinetics derived from substrate measurements can be used to model SOFC performance and the influence of electrochemistry on the MSR reaction kinetics is rarely reported. In this work a rate equation is selected based on experimental observations and kinetics proposed in literature, on both industrial catalysts and SOFC anode materials. Ideal reactor models are derived for two specific test setup geometries, considering the electrochemical reactions in the anode. The ideal reactor models are then used to fit the parameters of the <b>selected</b> <b>rate</b> equation to experimental data from earlier work. The <b>selected</b> <b>rate</b> equation is of the Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson type. The rate determining kinetics are characterised by the slow reaction of surface adsorbed carbon hydroxide forming carbon monoxide and atomic hydrogen. In addition surface coverage of atomic oxygen on the catalyst is limiting the available number of reaction sites. Two constants and their respective energies, associated with the activation of the rate limiting kinetics and the surface adsorption of oxygen, are fitted to experimental data. To evaluate the <b>selected</b> <b>rate</b> equation Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) type models are developed for the two experimental setups, one with a Ni?GDC anode and the other utilising a Ni?YSZ anode. These model are used to solve fluid dynamics, heat transfer, species transport, and electrochemistry. To model methane steam reforming in the fuel cell anode the <b>selected</b> <b>rate</b> equation is implemented in the CFD models. The obtained models are used to simulate MSR on the fuel cell anode for the experimental conditions. The modelled methane conversions and I-V characteristics are compared to the experimental values. The spatial distributions in the anode predicted with the <b>selected</b> <b>rate</b> equation and a power law model, fitted to the same experimental data, are compared to evaluate the use of global reaction models. For the Ni?GDC anode setup the model predicts the experimental methane conversions with good accuracy: the R 2 value is with 0. 987 close to unity. The experimental and modelled I-V characteristics are in good agreement. The model adopting a power law reaction mechanism underestimates the gradients in the anode. However, the model shows poor agreement with the experimental results obtained on the Ni?YSZ test setup. Large deviations with the temperatures and concentrations assumed in the ideal reactor model are found which might explain the inaccuracy of the model. The good agreement on the Ni?GDC anode suggests that MSR kinetics in SOFCs can be modelled for both open and closed circuit conditions with an appropriate intrinsic rate equation. This was not confirmed for the Ni?YSZ anode. Therefore further investigation with a combined experimental and modelling ap- proach, preferably on similar setups, is required.

30|$|A recent {{protocol}} CoRoute [33] is an anypath vehicular {{routing protocol}} for CR-VANETs that exploits geo-location and sensed channel information. CoRoute extends the anypath multirate scheme proposed in [82] to include cognitive radio and geo-location. With anypath multirate routing, a node broadcasts {{to a set}} of nodes using a <b>selected</b> <b>rate.</b> Then, any one of them forwards the packet towards the destination in the same way while the other nodes in the set avoid broadcasting duplicate copies if they hear the first broadcast. This routing has an anypath property that any node that received the packet can forward it and hence, the path can change depending on which node received the packet. If multiple nodes receive broadcast then, the one with highest priority forwards the packet. This priority is chosen based on the expected anypath transmission time (EATT), which is the expected time to transmit a packet to the forwarding set depending on packet size, bitrate, and the delivery probability that the packet is received at least by a single node in the forwarding set.|$|E

40|$|The Dodd-Frank Act {{promised to}} usher in {{sweeping}} changes to overhaul the rating agency industry whose shortcomings helped {{to pave the way}} to the financial crisis. But two years after the Act’s passage, hopes have given way to disappointment. The most important challenges of how to enhance rating agency competition, accuracy, and accountability remain largely open questions. The Securities 2 ̆ 6 Exchange Commission (SEC) has made progress in heightening rating agency oversight and addressing the most egregious abuses that fueled the financial crisis. But rating agency reforms have fallen far short of their potential due to the Act’s competing objectives to marginalize ratings, to expose rating agencies to greater sunlight and private liability exposure, and to treat rating agencies as a regulated industry. The {{most important part of the}} Act remains the most unresolved: the SEC’s mandate to design an alternative for the issuer-pays system that addresses the conflicts of interest created by debt issuers <b>selecting</b> their <b>rating</b> agency gatekeepers. Prospects for an independent commission to <b>select</b> <b>rating</b> agencies for structured finance products have foundered due to the challenges of crafting benchmarks for rating agency performance to use in <b>selecting</b> <b>rating</b> agencies and holding them accountable. The danger is that any standard chosen for rating agencies could fuel herding effects as rating agencies may shape their methodologies to game the system, rather than to enhance accurate and timely assessments of credit risk. Given the difficulties in resolving this issue, this Article suggests that policymakers should consider alternative ways to enhance competition such as by using regulatory incentives to break up the leading rating agencies, so that smaller rating agencies can more plausibly compete. Additionally, it suggests the potential for expanding the scope of private enforcement opportunities to leverage the self-interest of issuers to prosecute grossly negligent conduct by rating agencies. This approach would complement the SEC’s ongoing efforts to foster greater competition and accountability...|$|R
