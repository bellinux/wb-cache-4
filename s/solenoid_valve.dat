5000|$|<b>Solenoid</b> <b>valves</b> {{are used}} in fluid power {{pneumatic}} and hydraulic systems, to control cylinders, fluid power motors or larger industrial valves. Automatic irrigation sprinkler systems also use <b>solenoid</b> <b>valves</b> with an automatic controller. Domestic washing machines and dishwashers use <b>solenoid</b> <b>valves</b> to control water entry into the machine. They are also often used in paintball gun triggers to actuate the CO2 hammer <b>valve.</b> <b>Solenoid</b> <b>valves</b> are usually referred to simply as [...] "solenoids." ...|$|R

50|$|In some {{solenoid valves}} the solenoid acts {{directly}} on the main valve. Others use a small, complete <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve,</b> known as a pilot, to actuate a larger valve. While the second type is actually a <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve</b> combined with a pneumatically actuated valve, they are sold and packaged as a single unit {{referred to as a}} <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve.</b> Piloted valves require much less power to control, but they are noticeably slower. Piloted solenoids usually need full power at all times to open and stay open, where a direct acting solenoid may only need full power {{for a short period of}} time to open it, and only low power to hold it.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{proposes a}} sliding mode law for precise {{position}} control with minimal switching activity for a robotic system that uses on/off (solenoid) pneumatic actuators. For a two-chamber pneumatic actuator with four binary <b>solenoid</b> <b>valves,</b> {{there is a}} total of sixteen possible input combinations defined directly {{from the state of}} the four on/off <b>solenoid</b> <b>valves</b> present in the system. However, only seven of these discrete operating modes are considered both functional and unique. Accordingly, we use a seven-mode sliding controller that minimizes the position error using modes that have both the necessary and sufficient amounts of drive energy and, thus, involve reduced switching activity. An analysis of the closed- loop system stability is carried out. The performance of the proposed control design is experimentally verified on a single pneumatic actuator comprising of two chambers driven by four on/off <b>solenoid</b> <b>valves...</b>|$|R
