40|$|Research on {{confidence}} judgements <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> {{people are}} often overconfident. However, some {{studies have found that}} depressed mood reduces this positive bias. To date this has been explained as a mood phenomenon. In this study we explore an alternative theory which <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> confidence is related to internal judgements of social rank and status. This theory <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the lower one perceives oneself to be in status and rank the less one can afford to be overconfident. Data from a student population <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> confidence judgements are associated with internal judgements of status...|$|R

50|$|The {{recognition}} of long-branch attraction implies {{that there is}} some other evidence <b>that</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> the phylogeny is incorrect.

5000|$|Raymond et al. (1992) [...] <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> the attentional blink is {{produced}} by perceptual uncertainty amongst the target (T1) and following target (T2). They <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> this confusion happens {{at some point in}} the target identification processes. When confusion is eliminated, attentional blink isn’t observed. The researchers also <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> one way to eliminate confusion is to have items that cannot be named.|$|R
50|$|In {{sentence}} a, {{the first}} criterion (agreement) {{and the second}} criterion (position occupied) <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> there is the subject, whereas the third criterion (semantic role) <b>suggests</b> rather <b>that</b> problems is the subject. In sentence b, in contrast, agreement and semantic role <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> problems is the subject, whereas position occupied <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> there is the subject. In such cases then, one can take the first criterion as the most telling; the subject should agree with the finite verb.|$|R
