500|$|The filming {{introduced}} {{a number of}} technical challenges, with the producer Adam Tandy explaining that the simultaneous singing and conversing made production particularly difficult: [...] "To record it all 'clean' and have options in the edit, that was technically hard on everybody." [...] Typically, karaoke scenes in television will see characters sing only the opening lines, {{but because of the}} format of Inside No. 9, the characters in [...] "Empty Orchestra" [...] sing the whole song. Each character sang a song, with the vocals recorded live. The actors wore an earpiece to listen to the music while singing; Howlett's, used so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> the beat, was taped under her wig, and she was counted in by Outhwaite. Filming took a week, with days focussed on particular songs.|$|E
500|$|Björk premiered Biophilias songs {{during the}} Manchester International Festival with a {{residency}} {{commissioned by the}} Festival itself. The singer played in a circular stage which included custom-made instruments like computer-controlled Pendulum Harps and a Tesla Coil, an instrument called Gameleste, an hybrid between a gamelan and a celesta, and a pin Barrel organ called Sharpsichord. The stage also included a circle of projection screens. During the [...] "Mutual Core" [...] performance, the screen projected images of moving tectonic plates, which Alan Pedder of the website Wearsthetrousers likened to [...] "Jóga"'s music video, while the choir performed a sort of choreography, which included huddling at center stage during the verses and dancing during the chorus. The song was performed on every date of her Biophilia Tour. Her performance was well received by critics, which praised the whole show and project, which was called [...] "ambitious". While reviewing Björk's show at the New York Hall of Science, Will Hermes of the website PembrokeMayball stated that [...] "during 'Mutual Core', she sang of tectonic plates under a circle of projection screens illustrating the phenomena, and licked her lips after a line about how 'the Atlantic ridge drifts' like <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> that motion tingle beneath her skin".|$|E
500|$|Homer has complex {{relationships}} {{with all three}} of his children, {{and the rest of}} his family. He often berates Bart, but the two commonly share adventures and are sometimes allies; some episodes, particularly in later seasons, show that the pair have a strange respect for each other's cunning. Homer and Lisa have opposite personalities and he usually overlooks Lisa's talents, but when made aware of his neglect, does everything he can to help her. While Homer's thoughtless antics often upset his family, he on many occasions has also revealed himself to be a very caring and loving father and husband: in [...] "Lisa the Beauty Queen", (season four, 1992) he sold his cherished ride on the Duff blimp and used the money to enter Lisa in a beauty pageant so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> better about herself; in [...] "Rosebud", (season five, 1993) he gave up his chance at wealth to allow Maggie to keep a cherished teddy bear, despite the show also occasionally implying Homer forgets he has a third child, while the episode [...] "And Maggie Makes Three" [...] suggests she is the chief reason Homer took and remains at his regular job (season six, 1995); in [...] "Radio Bart", (season three, 1992) he spearheaded an attempt to dig Bart out after he had fallen down a well; and in [...] "A Milhouse Divided", (season eight, 1996) he arranged a surprise second wedding with Marge to make up for their unsatisfactory first ceremony. Homer, however, has a poor relationship with his father Abraham [...] "Grampa" [...] Simpson, whom he placed in a nursing home as soon as he could. The Simpson family will often do their best to avoid unnecessary contact with Grampa, but Homer has shown feelings of love for his father from time to time.|$|E

6000|$|Which, {{after an}} instant, she had {{accepted}} from him; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> so <b>feel</b> at last {{that it was}} true. [...] "Then I shall have need of it all." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> not see Chauvelin, but <b>she</b> <b>could</b> almost <b>feel</b> those keen, pale {{eyes of his}} fixed maliciously {{upon her}} {{helpless}} form, and his hurried, whispered words reached her ear, as the death-knell of her last faint, lingering hope.|$|R
2500|$|Ron Howard stated that, {{after the}} first test preview of the film, one of the comment cards {{indicated}} [...] "total disdain"; the audience member had written {{that it was a}} [...] "typical Hollywood" [...] ending and that the crew would never have survived. Marilyn Lovell praised Quinlan's portrayal of her, stating she felt <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> what Quinlan's character was going through, and remembered how she felt in her mind.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of a {{terrorist}} attack known as the Alexandria Incident, which claimed 3,000 lives, Cable re-formed the mutant black ops team [...] so that mutantkind not only had a continued place in the world, but also had a stake in it. While Cable recruited Fantomex, Marrow and Dr. Nemesis as his teammates, Psylocke actually sought Cable because she couldn't bear staying away from X-Force as she admitted she was addicted to killing. Their first mission had the team track and face Volga, a wealthy business man responsible for the abduction and weaponization of several mutants and depowered mutants. As a member of X-Force, Psylocke grew more bloodthirsty, self-loathing and broken by the day, admitting that resorting to killing was the only way <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> anything at all. She also kept a sexual relationship with Cable. X-Force also faced Fantomex, who was driven to the point of insanity and received god-like powers. Psylocke ultimately used her mind blade to scramble Fantomex's brain.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2006, Lewis won {{the third}} series of British reality singing contest, The X Factor, her prize being a £1 million {{recording}} contract with Sony BMG, for which Simon Cowell is an A executive. Cowell also mentored Lewis on the show. During the live final, Lewis duetted with Gary Barlow of band Take That, who told Cowell, [...] "This girl is probably fifty {{times better than}} any other contestant you have ever had, so you have a big responsibility to make the right record with her." [...] Cowell admitted that Barlow's words resonated with him, and thus {{the decision was made to}} not rush her debut album, as he wanted an [...] "incredible record" [...] of original material, which he believed could not be done in less than a year. Lewis also wanted a high quality album that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> proud of. Cowell told Lewis that he did not care if the album took three years to make, he wanted to get it right.|$|E
60|$|A quiver {{passed up}} from the heart so praised to the still lips. No, she was not hard-hearted! <b>She</b> <b>could</b> even <b>feel</b> for this old woman from whose voice anxiety had stolen its despotism.|$|R
50|$|Pat's next horse, {{the grey}} mare Carmena, {{came after the}} parting with Finality. Although Carmena was a talented and {{successful}} horse, Pat admitted that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> never <b>feel</b> the same closeness she had had with Finality.|$|R
60|$|Fanny {{left the}} room with a very sorrowful heart; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> the {{difference}} to be so small, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not think of living with her aunt with anything like satisfaction. As soon as she met with Edmund she told him her distress.|$|R
60|$|The little flame died out. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> {{his body}} trembling.|$|E
60|$|Through the open-worked {{sleeves of}} her dress <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> the sun bite vigorously.|$|E
60|$|She {{could see}} him brace himself. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> him brace his very body ere he answered.|$|E
60|$|Kennicott was triumphant {{when the}} Commercial Club did capture one small shy factory which planned to make wooden automobile-wheels, but when Carol saw the {{promoter}} <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> that his coming much mattered--and a year after, when he failed, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> {{not be very}} sorrowful.|$|R
6000|$|Jeff hesitated, {{and then}} said: [...] "Well, not yet, mother," [...] and he bent an entreating look upon Cynthia which <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> was wholly for himself. [...] "I--I guess {{we can fix}} it, somehow. I behaved very badly to Cynthia." ...|$|R
60|$|Instantly she was {{whirling}} {{through the}} air, so swiftly that all <b>she</b> <b>could</b> see or <b>feel</b> was the wind whistling past her ears.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> him thinking: 'Perhaps it {{will make}} her nice to me!' He turned {{suddenly}} and went.|$|E
60|$|Blanche breathed {{more freely}} {{when she found}} herself alone. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> the relief now of seeing Anne revive.|$|E
60|$|He swung negligently. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> him {{falling and}} lifting through the air, {{as if he}} were lying on some force.|$|E
60|$|Ursula {{went home}} to Beldover faint, dim, closed up. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} speak or notice. It was as if her energy were frozen. Her people asked her what was the matter. She told them she had broken off the engagement with Skrebensky. They looked blank and angry. But <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> any more.|$|R
6000|$|... "I had furs on," [...] said Mabel. [...] "What {{a lovely}} spot it is, {{even in this}} weather." [...] Then dinner was announced. She had not been cold. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> still <b>feel</b> the {{tingling}} heat of her blood as she had implored him to love her.|$|R
60|$|Since {{this wild}} {{experience}} of Joan's had begun {{she had been}} sick so many times with raw and naked emotions hitherto unknown to her, that <b>she</b> believed <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> another new fear or torture. But these strange sensations grew by {{what they had been}} fed upon.|$|R
60|$|Involuntarily {{she closed}} her eyes as Billy's thumb-ends pressed into them. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> the fore-running ache of a dull and terrible hurt.|$|E
6000|$|... “Well,” said Nettie with {{a little}} smile, though <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> her heart beating, “I feel more like a torpedo than ever just now.” ...|$|E
60|$|His {{answer came}} in a swift, {{throbbing}} question, his lips so near her face that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> his breath hot upon her cheek.|$|E
60|$|His remorse {{was evidently}} genuine, and Beatrice felt {{somewhat}} appeased. Perhaps {{it did not}} altogether grieve her to learn that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> make him <b>feel</b> sorry.|$|R
60|$|Right glad was Mrs Lockley to {{find that}} her husband had passed the Blue Boar without going in on his way home, and {{although}} she did not say so, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> sorry for the accident to the Lively Poll, which had sent him ashore a week before his proper time.|$|R
60|$|It seemed she {{scarcely}} saw {{her class}} the next day. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> only <b>feel</b> her will, {{and what she}} would have of this class which she must grasp into subjection. It was no good, any more, to appeal, to play upon the better feelings of the class. Her swift-working soul realized this.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> {{her last}} {{strength}} going, and the barrel resisted her. Hans hurried to her, and the barrel went {{out from under}} Michael Dennin.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Lucy has {{the oldest}} claim,' said Phoebe, thoughtfully, wishing <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> equally desirous {{of success in}} this affair as in that of Mervyn and Cecily.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Too near!' said Hugh, stooping {{over her}} so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>feel</b> his breath upon her forehead. 'Why too near? You're always proud to ME, mistress.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Anne flinched {{with the}} pain of his voice. And there was so little <b>she</b> <b>could</b> say that would be {{adequate}} to the situation. Blame {{was out of the}} question--advice was not needed--sympathy was mocked by the man's stark agony. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> only <b>feel</b> with him in a maze of compassion and regret. Her heart ached for Leslie! Had not that poor girl suffered enough without this? ...|$|R
60|$|Jill {{had listened}} to this {{diatribe}} with a certain uneasiness. Her brief encounters with Mr. Goble told her that every word was probably true. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> still <b>feel</b> the unpleasant sensation of being inspected by the eye which Wally had compared--quite justly--to that of a codfish. But her pride forbade any admission of weakness.|$|R
60|$|Helen sighed, she {{supposed}} the Major knew best. Mr. Foker {{had been very}} kind in the wretched business with Miss Costigan, certainly, and she was grateful to him. But <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>feel</b> otherwise than a dim presentiment of evil; and all these quarrels, and riots, and worldliness, scared her {{about the fate of}} her boy.|$|R
