5|$|Doppler bubble {{detection}} allows {{models to}} use bubble formation as an endpoint rather than <b>symptomatic</b> DCS.|$|E
5|$|Early {{decompression}} models {{tended to}} use the dissolved phase models, and adjusted them by factors derived from experimental observations {{to reduce the risk}} of <b>symptomatic</b> bubble formation.|$|E
5|$|In 1908 John Scott Haldane {{prepared}} the first recognized decompression {{table for the}} British Admiralty, based on extensive experiments on goats using an end point of <b>symptomatic</b> DCS.|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{outcomes}} are generally good, though {{some people may}} have recurrent <b>symptomatic</b> episodes. Only {{a small proportion of}} persons end up needing surgery.|$|E
5|$|One {{study has}} {{reported}} {{a connection between}} a specific genetic marker and disorganized attachment (not RAD) associated with problems of parenting. Another author has compared atypical social behavior in genetic conditions such as Williams syndrome with behaviors <b>symptomatic</b> of RAD.|$|E
5|$|Research {{directions}} on MS treatments include investigations of MS pathogenesis and heterogeneity; research of more effective, convenient, or tolerable new treatments for RRMS; creation of therapies for the progressive subtypes; neuroprotection strategies; {{and the search}} for effective <b>symptomatic</b> treatments.|$|E
5|$|The RDP {{was tested}} for single day {{multi-level}} dives and multi-day dives with multiple dives per day. There were no incidences of <b>symptomatic</b> DCS during testing.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} Alzheimer's disease; {{available}} treatments offer relatively small <b>symptomatic</b> benefit but remain palliative in nature. Current treatments {{can be divided into}} pharmaceutical, psychosocial and caregiving.|$|E
5|$|About 20% are {{affected}} by <b>symptomatic</b> digestive tract lesions, although a higher percentage have lesions that do not cause symptoms. These lesions may bleed intermittently, which is rarely significant enough to be noticed (in the form of bloody vomiting or black stool), but can eventually lead to depletion of iron in the body, resulting in iron-deficiency anemia.|$|E
5|$|As the autobodies {{are found}} mainly in {{patients}} that have characteristics of several different autoimmune diseases, the clinical symptoms {{of these patients}} can vary widely. The symptoms that are seen most often are the typical symptoms of the individual autoimmune diseases and include Raynaud's phenomenon, arthritis, myositis and scleroderma. Treatment of these patients is <b>symptomatic</b> and is similar to treatment for the individual autoimmune disease, often involving either immunosuppressive or immunomodulating drugs.|$|E
5|$|Decompression may be {{continuous}} or staged, {{where the}} ascent {{is interrupted by}} stops at regular depth intervals, but the entire ascent {{is part of the}} decompression, and ascent rate can be critical to harmless elimination of inert gas. What is commonly known as no-decompression diving, or more accurately no-stop decompression, relies on limiting ascent rate for avoidance of excessive bubble formation. Staged decompression may include deep stops depending on the theoretical model used for calculating the ascent schedule. Omission of decompression theoretically required for a dive profile exposes the diver to significantly higher risk of <b>symptomatic</b> decompression sickness, and in severe cases, serious injury or death. The risk is related to the severity of exposure and the level of supersaturation of tissues in the diver. Procedures for emergency management of omitted decompression and <b>symptomatic</b> decompression sickness have been published. These procedures are generally effective, but vary in effectiveness from case to case.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that human {{resources}} are a pillar of any research and innovation policy, the Medium Term Plan 2011–2015 did not discuss any explicit policy for promoting postgraduate studies {{in science and engineering}}. The scarcity of new PhDs in science and engineering fields from the University of Zimbabwe in 2013 was <b>symptomatic</b> of this omission.|$|E
5|$|During a 2004 {{assessment}} of Texas waterways, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality found {{higher than normal}} levels of bacteria {{at the mouth of}} Carancahua Creek and alkaline pH levels, <b>symptomatic</b> of algal bloom. The issues discovered by the Commission were common in the water bodies examined for the study, and they noted that such issues would be addressed.|$|E
5|$|During <b>symptomatic</b> attacks, {{administration}} of {{high doses of}} intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, is the usual therapy, with oral corticosteroids seeming to have a similar efficacy and safety profile. Although, in general, effective {{in the short term}} for relieving symptoms, corticosteroid treatments do not appear to {{have a significant impact on}} long-term recovery. The consequences of severe attacks that do not respond to corticosteroids might be treatable by plasmapheresis.|$|E
5|$|Ross {{fell ill}} again in September 1863. From September 27 through March 1864, he {{suffered}} recurring attacks of fever and chills every three days, <b>symptomatic</b> of tertian malaria. Despite his illness, Ross {{never missed a}} day of duty, and in early 1864 {{he was promoted to}} brigadier general, becoming the ninth-youngest general officer of the Confederate Army. Following his promotion, unit morale improved, and every one of his men re-enlisted.|$|E
5|$|Seizures {{may also}} {{occur as a}} {{consequence}} of other health problems; if they occur right around a specific cause, such as a stroke, head injury, toxic ingestion or metabolic problem, they are known as acute <b>symptomatic</b> seizures and are in the broader classification of seizure-related disorders rather than epilepsy itself.|$|E
5|$|Subtle {{problems}} with the executive functions of attentiveness, planning, flexibility, and abstract thinking, or impairments in semantic memory (memory of meanings, and concept relationships) can also be <b>symptomatic</b> of {{the early stages of}} AD. Apathy can be observed at this stage, and remains the most persistent neuropsychiatric symptom throughout the course of the disease. Depressive symptoms, irritability and reduced awareness of subtle memory difficulties are also common.|$|E
5|$|Syndromes {{in which}} causes are not clearly {{identified}} {{are difficult to}} match with categories of the current classification of epilepsy. Categorization for these cases was made somewhat arbitrarily. The idiopathic (unknown cause) category of the 2011 classification includes syndromes in which the general clinical features and/or age specificity strongly point to a presumed genetic cause. Some childhood epilepsy syndromes {{are included in the}} unknown cause category in which the cause is presumed genetic, for instance benign rolandic epilepsy. Others are included in <b>symptomatic</b> despite a presumed genetic cause (in at least in some cases), for instance Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Clinical syndromes in which epilepsy is not the main feature (e.g. Angelman syndrome) were categorized <b>symptomatic</b> but it was argued to include these within the category idiopathic. Classification of epilepsies and particularly of epilepsy syndromes will change with advances in research.|$|E
5|$|The {{common cold}} {{is the most}} common human disease and affects people all over the globe. Adults {{typically}} have two to five infections annually, and children may have six to ten colds a year (and up to twelve colds a year for school children). Rates of <b>symptomatic</b> infections increase in the elderly due to declining immunity.|$|E
5|$|The most {{effective}} method of avoiding genital infections is by avoiding vaginal, oral, and anal sex. Condom use decreases the risk somewhat. Daily antiviral medication taken {{by someone who}} has the infection can also reduce spread. There is no available vaccine and once infected, there is no cure. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) and topical lidocaine {{may be used to}} help with the symptoms. Treatments with antiviral medication such as aciclovir or valaciclovir can lessen the severity of <b>symptomatic</b> episodes.|$|E
5|$|The {{ratio of}} carboxy{{hemoglobin}} to hemoglobin molecules {{in an average}} person may be up to 5%, although cigarette smokers who smoke two packs per day may have levels up to 9%. In <b>symptomatic</b> poisoned people they are often in the 10–30% range, while persons who die may have postmortem blood levels of 30–90%.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{approaches}} to treating Chagas disease: antiparasitic treatment, {{to kill the}} parasite; and <b>symptomatic</b> treatment, to manage the symptoms and signs of the infection. Management uniquely involves addressing selective incremental failure of the parasympathetic nervous system. Autonomic disease imparted by Chagas may eventually result in megaesophagus, megacolon and accelerated dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms that explain why Chagas targets the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system and spares the sympathetic autonomic nervous system remain poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|Urinary {{catheterization}} {{increases the}} risk for urinary tract infections. The risk of bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine) is between three and six percent per day and prophylactic antibiotics are not effective in decreasing <b>symptomatic</b> infections. The risk of an associated infection can be decreased by catheterizing only when necessary, using aseptic technique for insertion, and maintaining unobstructed closed drainage of the catheter.|$|E
5|$|Actual {{rates of}} {{diffusion}} and perfusion, and solubility of gases in specific physiological tissues are not generally known, and vary considerably. However mathematical {{models have been}} proposed that approximate the real situation {{to a greater or}} lesser extent. These models predict whether <b>symptomatic</b> bubble formation is likely to occur for a given dive profile. Algorithms based on these models produce decompression tables. In personal dive computers, they produce a real-time estimate of decompression status and display it for the diver.|$|E
5|$|Antimotility {{medication}} has {{a theoretical}} risk of causing complications, and although clinical experience has shown {{this to be}} unlikely, these drugs are discouraged in people with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that is complicated by fever. Loperamide, an opioid analogue, is commonly used for the <b>symptomatic</b> treatment of diarrhea. Loperamide is not recommended in children, however, as it may cross the immature blood–brain barrier and cause toxicity. Bismuth subsalicylate, an insoluble complex of trivalent bismuth and salicylate, {{can be used in}} mild to moderate cases, but salicylate toxicity is theoretically possible.|$|E
5|$|Chemotherapy may be {{combined}} with palliative care {{in the treatment of}} the NSCLC. In advanced cases, appropriate chemotherapy improves average survival over supportive care alone, as well as improving quality of life. With adequate physical fitness maintaining chemotherapy during lung cancer palliation offers 1.5 to 3 months of prolongation of survival, <b>symptomatic</b> relief, and an improvement in quality of life, with better results seen with modern agents. The NSCLC Meta-Analyses Collaborative Group recommends if the recipient wants and can tolerate treatment, then chemotherapy should be considered in advanced NSCLC.|$|E
5|$|If {{symptoms}} develop {{during the}} acute phase, they usually resolve spontaneously within three {{to eight weeks}} in approximately 90% of individuals. Although the symptoms resolve, even with treatment the infection persists and enters a chronic phase. Of individuals with chronic Chagas disease, 60–80% will never develop symptoms (called indeterminate chronic Chagas disease), while the remaining 20–40% will develop life-threatening heart and/or digestive disorders during their lifetime (called determinate chronic Chagas disease). In 10% of individuals, the disease progresses directly from the acute form to a <b>symptomatic</b> clinical form of chronic Chagas disease.|$|E
5|$|Instead of anticoagulation, a {{follow-up}} imaging test (typically ultrasound) about one-week post-diagnosis {{is an option}} for those with an acute isolated distal DVT without a high risk for extension; if the clot does not grow, the ACCP does not recommend anticoagulation. This technique can benefit those at a high risk for bleeding. Patients may choose anticoagulation over serial imaging, however, to avoid the inconvenience of another scan if concerns {{about the risk of}} bleeding are insignificant. When applied to <b>symptomatic</b> patients with a negative initial ultrasound result, serial testing is inefficient and not cost effective.|$|E
5|$|Limitations include that a {{consistent}} set of gases {{must be used}} which match the specific ratio model, and the specific ratio will only be relevant to a limited range of depths. As the parameters {{move away from the}} base conditions, conservatism will diverge, and the probability of <b>symptomatic</b> bubble formation will become more unpredictable. There is also the requirement for the diver to do mental arithmetic at depth to calculate the parameters of a safety-critical operation. This may be complicated by adverse circumstances or an emergency situation.|$|E
5|$|Normally the plantar fascia {{has three}} {{fascicle}}s {{with the central}} fascicle thickest at 4mm, the lateral fascicle at 2mm and the medial at less than a millimeter in thickness. In theory, the likeliness of fasciitis increases with increasing thickness of plantar fascia at the calcaneal insertion, with thickness of more than 4.5mm being somewhat useful on ultrasound and 4mm on MRI. Findings on imaging such as plantar aponeurosis thickening, however, may be absent in <b>symptomatic</b> individuals or present in asymptomatic individuals thereby limiting the utility of such observations.|$|E
5|$|Returning from a Hong Kong {{business}} trip, Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) has a layover in Chicago to {{rendezvous with}} a former lover before returning to her family in suburban Minneapolis. She appears to have contracted a cold during her trip. Her six-year-old son from a previous marriage, Clark, also becomes <b>symptomatic</b> and is sent home from school. Beth's condition worsens and two days later she collapses with severe seizures. Her husband, Mitch (Matt Damon), rushes her to the hospital, but she dies of an unknown cause.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} {{surgical}} versus non-surgical treatments for osteochondritis dissecans is controversial. Consequently, {{the type and}} extent of surgery necessary varies based on patient age, severity of the lesion, and personal bias of the treating surgeon—entailing an exhaustive list of suggested treatments. A variety of surgical options exist {{for the treatment of}} persistently <b>symptomatic,</b> intact, partially detached, and completely detached OCD lesions. Post-surgery reparative cartilage is inferior to healthy hyaline cartilage in glycosaminoglycan concentration, histological, and immunohistochemical appearance. As a result, surgery is often avoided if non-operative treatment is viable.|$|E
5|$|The <b>symptomatic</b> (determinate) chronic stage {{affects the}} nervous system, {{digestive}} system and heart. About two-thirds {{of people with}} chronic symptoms have cardiac damage, including dilated cardiomyopathy, which causes heart rhythm abnormalities and may result in sudden death. About one-third of patients go on to develop digestive system damage, resulting in dilation of the digestive tract (megacolon and megaesophagus), accompanied by severe weight loss. Swallowing difficulties (secondary achalasia) {{may be the first}} symptom of digestive disturbances and may lead to malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|When in the hospital, glucose {{levels are}} checked several times daily {{and the patient}} is {{monitored}} for signs of <b>symptomatic</b> ketosis (which can be treated with a small quantity of orange juice). Lack of energy and lethargy are common but disappear within two weeks. The parents attend classes over the first three full days, which cover nutrition, managing the diet, preparing meals, avoiding sugar and handling illness. The level of parental education and commitment required is higher than with medication.|$|E
25|$|Because {{infection}} is rarely <b>symptomatic,</b> treatment is rarely required. There {{have been no}} published trials so treatment remains empirical. Agents {{that have been used}} include albendazole, metronidazole and cotrimoxazole for myositis. Corticosteroids have also been used for <b>symptomatic</b> relief.|$|E
25|$|One review {{found that}} 11% of teeth will have {{evidence}} {{of disease and}} are <b>symptomatic,</b> 0.6% will be <b>symptomatic</b> but have no disease, 51% will be asymptomatic but have disease present and 37% will be asymptomatic and have no disease.|$|E
