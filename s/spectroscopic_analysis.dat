5|$|At {{the time}} of its discovery, astronomers {{believed}} Sakurai's Object to be a slow nova.

V605 Aquilae, which was discovered in 1919, is the only other star known to have been observed during the high luminosity phase of a very late thermal pulse, and models predict that Sakurai's Object, over the next few decades, will follow a similar life cycle.|$|E

5|$|On July 19, 2009, exactly 15 {{years after}} the SL9 impacts, a new black spot {{about the size of}} the Pacific Ocean {{appeared}} in Jupiter's southern hemisphere. Thermal infrared measurements showed the impact site was warm and <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>analysis</b> detected the production of excess hot ammonia and silica-rich dust in the upper regions of Jupiter's atmosphere. Scientists have concluded that another impact event had occurred, but this time a more compact and strong object, probably a small undiscovered asteroid, was the cause.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{evidence}} of the oxygen atmosphere comes from spectral detection of gases trapped in the ice at the surface of Ganymede. The detection of ozone (O3) bands was announced in 1996. In 1997 <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>analysis</b> revealed the dimer (or diatomic) absorption features of molecular oxygen. Such an absorption can arise only if the oxygen is in a dense phase. The best candidate is molecular oxygen trapped in ice. The depth of the dimer absorption bands depends on latitude and longitude, rather than on surface albedo—they tend to decrease with increasing latitude on Ganymede, whereas O3 shows an opposite trend. Laboratory work has found that O2 would not cluster or bubble but dissolve in ice at Ganymede's relatively warm surface temperature of 100 K (−173.15°C).|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{define the}} {{metallicity}} {{of a star}} as the abundance of chemical elements that have a higher atomic number than helium. This is measured by a <b>spectroscopic</b> <b>analysis</b> of the atmosphere, followed by a comparison with the results expected from computed stellar models. In the case of IK Pegasus A, the estimated metal abundance is  = +0.07 ± 0.20. This notation gives the logarithm of the ratio of metal elements (M) to hydrogen (H), minus the logarithm of the Sun's metal ratio. (Thus if the star matches the metal abundance of the Sun, this value will be zero.) A logarithmic value of 0.07 is equivalent to an actual metallicity ratio of 1.17, so the star is about 17% richer in metallic elements than the Sun. However {{the margin of error}} for this result is relatively large.|$|E

Despite the fact that the presence of non-radial modes could be confirmed, the degree or azimuthal order could not be uniquely identified. Here we present an improvement to this first <b>spectroscopic</b> line-profile <b>analysis.</b> Aims: We aim to study line-profile variations of stochastically excited solar-like oscillations in four evolved stars to derive the azimuthal order of the observed mode and the surface rotational frequency. Methods: <b>Spectroscopic</b> line-profile <b>analysis</b> is applied to cross-correlation functions, using the Fourier Parameter Fit method on the amplitude and phase distributions across the profiles. Results: For four evolved stars, beta Hydri (G 2 IV), epsilon Ophiuchi (G 9. 5 III), eta Serpentis (K 0 III) and delta Eridani (K 0 IV) the line-profile variations reveal the azimuthal order of the oscillations with an accuracy of ~ 1. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the projected rotational velocity and the inclination angle. From these parameters we obtain the surface rotational frequency. Conclusions: We conclude that line-profile variations of cross-correlation functions behave differently for different frequencies and that they provide additional information in terms of the surface rotational frequency and azimuthal order.
