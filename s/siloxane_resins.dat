40|$|Corrosion, the {{environmentally}} induced {{degradation of}} materials, {{is a very}} costly problem that has {{a major impact on}} the global economy. Results from a 2 -year breakthrough study released in 2002 by the U. S. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) showed that the total annual estimated direct cost associated with metallic corrosion in nearly every U. S. industry sector was a staggering $ 276 billion, approximately 3. 1 % of the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GOP). Corrosion protective coatings are widely used to protect metallic structures from the detrimental effects of corrosion but their effectiveness can be seriously compromised by mechanical damage, such as a scratch, that exposes the metallic substrate. The incorporation of a self healing mechanism into a corrosion control coating would have the potential to significantly increase its effectiveness and useful lifetime. This paper describes work performed to incorporate a number of microcapsule-based self healing systems into corrosion control coatings. The work includes the preparation and evaluation of self-healing systems based on curable epoxy, acrylate, and <b>siloxane</b> <b>resins,</b> as well as, microencapsulated systems based on passive, solvent born, healing agent delivery. The synthesis and optimization of microcapsule-based self healing systems for thin coating (less than 100 micron) will be presented...|$|E
40|$|Our {{primary goal}} {{in this thesis}} was to develop {{convenient}} methods for the synthesis of oligomeric polycyclics which could be ring-opened at elevated temperatures {{in the presence of}} a catalyst to give new classes of thermoset materials. A simple and commercially attractive approach was utilized to synthesize novolac type resins by reacting p-substituted phenols with formaldehyde using a cation exchange resin as catalyst in the presence of chlorobenzene as solvent. Novel oligomeric polycyclic carbonates were prepared by reacting the multifunctional phenol-formaldehyde resin with excess triphosgene under high dilution conditions. When the oligomeric polycyclic carbonates were heated at elevated temperatures using an initiator, a highly cross-linked network was obtained. In addition, the polycyclics were mixed with a commercial BPA polycarbonate and cured at different temperatures {{in the presence of a}} catalyst. When the mixture of BPA polycarbonate with 10 wt. % polycyclic carbonate was cured at 350 ºC for 30 min. using a catalytic amount of lithium stearate, it gave a highly cross-linked network. Two series of polycyclic phosphonates were synthesized by reacting the oligomeric phenol-formaldehyde resins with phosphonic dichlorides under high dilution conditions in a polar aprotic solvent. The polycyclic phosphonates were similarly subjected to ring-opening polymerization at elevated temperatures in the presence of an initiator. The crosslinked phosphonates exhibited good flame retardance properties. Two classes of oligomeric <b>siloxane</b> <b>resins</b> were also synthesized by reacting the phenol-formaldehyde novolac type resins with dialkyl or diaryl dichloro, silanes under high dilution conditions. The formation of predominantly polycyclic siloxane structures was revealed by MALDI-TOF MS, Gradient HPLC and 1 H NMR. Blends of commercial polysiloxane gums with different proportions of polycyclic <b>siloxane</b> <b>resins</b> were subjected to curing at 300 ºC in the presence of KOH catalyst. Polysiloxane gums are highly unstable at 300 ºC in the presence of a basic catalyst. However, the cross-linked polysiloxane gum at 30 wt. % loading of polycyclic siloxanes, was sufficiently stable at this temperature. A Bisphenol A dimer (o, o' methylene bridged) was synthesized by a single-pot reaction between formaldehyde and excess BPA using cation exchange resin catalyst. A few novel classes of oligomeric polycyclics with low melt viscosities were synthesized from this dimer under high dilution conditions. A series of co-polycarbonates of BPA were synthesized by the reaction of methylene bridged dimer with BPA and triphosgene. An alternative in-situ polymerization method was also developed to synthesize the BPA co-polycarbonates. These co-polymers containing cross-linkable cyclic carbonate moieties on the backbone, gave thermoset materials when cured at elevated temperatures in the presence of a catalyst. Low molecular weight poly(aryl ether sulfone) s end-capped with metallophthalocyanine moieties were prepared by reacting poly(aryl ether sulfone) s containing o-phthalonitrile end-groups with excess phthalonitrile and metals/metal salts in quinoline. These polymers were characterized in detail by using IR, UV-VIS, 1 H NMR and GPC techniques. Annealing studies on the polymers containing PcM end-groups were undertaken in order to investigate the occurrence of stacking of plithalocyanine rings in the melt. This study was conducted by using a Thermo-Gravimettic/Differential Thermal Analysis (TG/DTA) instrument...|$|E

40|$|Water {{contributes}} substantially to {{the degradation}} of monuments through freezing and thawing cycles and also {{because it is a}} carrier of pollutants and salt solutions. Water repellency can be promoted by the application of a thin organic, hydrophobic, film. The efficacy of simple polymer coatings for monument protection is, however, still debated. We demonstrate that a polymer/nanoparticle composite film, composed of a <b>siloxane</b> <b>resin</b> and silica nanoparticles has superior properties. The film was applied on specimens of the Greek marble “Penteliko”, which is used for the restoration of the Akropolis of Athens. The equilibrium contact angle and the contact angle hysteresis were found to be 162 o and 6 o respectively, indicating that nanoparticles enhance the hydrophobic nature of the film. We note that the corresponding angles were 108 o and 20 o when pure <b>siloxane</b> <b>resin</b> was applied (no particles). Instead of the traditional film application by brush (or capillary absorption), a simple spraying technique was employed. Water vapour permeability, water capillary absorption and colourimetry measurements of the treated marble specimens were also carried out, to reveal the effect of the nanoparticles on these important parameters. The study was then extended to two more types of Greek marbles, with similar results. SEM and AFM were employed to reveal the micro- and nano-structure of the composite film {{as a function of the}} particle concentration. Enhanced hydrophobicity was explained by the Cassie-Baxter model...|$|R
40|$|Concrete {{structures}} {{are exposed to}} carbonation that may cause rapid decay, shortening their service life and raising maintenance and repair costs. Carbonation lowers the alkalinity of the concrete depassivating the steel reinforcement. Two limit states can be identified with regard to service life. The first limit state ends when the steel is depassivated. The second limit state is based on cracking of the concrete cover due to oxides generated during corrosion. The service life includes a certain propagation period of corrosion during which the cross-sectional area of steel is progressively decreased, the bond between steel and concrete is reduced and the effective cross-sectional area of concrete is diminished due to spalling of the cover. Surface treatment is commonly used to improve the resistance of concrete to carbonation. A barrier is formed retarding the carbonation reactions {{in the interior of}} the concrete. In this study surface protected concretes were compared with non-protected concretes. The used surface protected concretes presented generally lower carbonation diffusion coefficients than the non-protected concretes. The use of epoxy resin showed better protection than the use of acrylic and <b>siloxane</b> <b>resins.</b> The composition of the concretes is an important factor affecting the diffusion of carbonation. The influence of the water–cement ratio was very important. The carbonation diffusion coefficients increased with the water–cement ratio. The prescriptive methodology is not a guarantee to obtain the desired service lives of 50 or 100 years. The desired services lives were only obtained with the use of surface protection treatments...|$|E

40|$|Segmented {{polyurethane}} elastomers containing additional ordered structures {{within the}} hard or soft domains {{were developed to}} mimic the hierarchical structure and superior properties observed in spider silk fibers. The silk's toughness is related to a fiber morphology that includes P-pleated crystalline sheets within an amorphous matrix, {{as well as an}} additional interphase with an orientation and mobility between that of the two microphases. In the polyurethane mimics, bulky aromatic diisocyanates were incorporated between aliphatic hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) hard segments and poly(tetramethylene oxide) (PTMO) soft segments, to enhance the size and orientation of the interphase. The mixture of diisocyanates reduces the crystallinity of the HDI hard segments, allowing the polyurethane to form more well-organized domains observed by AFM imaging. The more interconnected hard domains allow the elastomers to deform to higher elongations and absorb more energy without a decrease of initial modulus. Shearing of the hydrogen-bonded hard domains orients the hard blocks at a preferred tilt angle of ± 20 ⁰ from the strain direction during tensile deformation. (cont.) While the average spacing of hard domains increases during deformation, the spacing of hard domains aligned with the strain decreases, and the spacing of hard domains at the preferred tilt angle remains constant. Strain-induced crystallization of the PTMO soft segments was observed in all samples; however, hard segments with mixed diisocyanates exhibited non-crystalline alignment of the hard domains. Several polyurethane nanocomposite structures were also created using particles that preferentially associate with hard or soft segments. HDI-PTMO polyurethane/Laponite nanocomposites provided modest mechanical property improvements (80 % increase in modulus and 15 % increase in toughness) without any loss of extensibility. The Laponite discs exhibited an exfoliated structure, associating with and reinforcing the hydrophilic polyurethane hard segments. HDI-PTMO polyurethane/MQ <b>siloxane</b> <b>resin</b> nanocomposites also exhibited particle association with the hard segments, providing a 60 % increase in modulus with a small loss of toughness. (cont.) However, composites of isobutyl-POSS dispersed in polyurethanes with mixed hard segments exhibited formation of POSS crystals associated with the soft segments at all loadings, resulting in tensile failure at strains 80 - 100 % lower than the pure polyurethane. by Gregory Stewart Pollock.

40|$|Epoxy resins need {{modifications}} by rubbery additives, fillers, etc. for {{enhancement of}} their usage in various applications. This study aims {{to determine the}} mechanical properties of silicone (i. e., amine-containing poly dimethyl <b>siloxane)</b> -modified <b>resins</b> in combinations with fly ash. The mechanical properties, especially tensile/flexural strength and moduli, were determined. Amine-containing silicone (ACS) was found to weaken the epoxy resin. However, ACS-modified epoxy resin was found to tolerate {{the addition of a}} small amount of fly ash filler as it had better tensile and flexural strengths compared with the unfilled, modified resin. In contrast to this, the unmodified resin was found to have its tensile and flexural strengths deteriorated by the filler. The reason for this behaviour was speculated to be due to the ACS acting as an additional coupling agent between the resin and the filler. These properties were sought to be correlated with free volume parameters measured from Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy. Free volume measurements appear to indicate enhanced epoxy-fly ash interactions by ACS. Scanning Electron Microscopy indicates better filler distribution in the ACS-modified resin compared with the unmodified resin...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the presented thesis was the development of photopolymerizable systems, which allow the production of parts with elastic properties {{by means of a}} stereolitography apparatus. For that purpose three basically different systems have been investigated regarding their suitability for the desired purpose: A. <b>resins</b> based on <b>siloxane</b> macromonomers B. <b>resins</b> based on oligomeric butadiene and C. resins based on monomeric acrylates and methacrylates By means of photopolymerisation polymers with the desired elastic properties have been created using resins of the type A and C. Elongation at break values of up to 155 % were achieved using e. g. methacryloxy-propyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane / n-hexylmethacrylate / ethylenglycol-dimethacrylate / 2 -dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate. It wasn't possible to get the desired elastomeric products using resins of type B. The <b>resins</b> on <b>siloxane</b> basis proofed to be reacting to sluggish for the use in a stereolithography apparatus. The acrylate resins on the other hand polymerized fast enough for the stereolithography environment. Using an acrylate resin based on 2 -hydroxyethylacrylate / n-decyl-methacrylate / ethylenglycoldimethacrylate experiments have been carried out to write a quadratic structure in a stereolithography apparatus.

40|$|Engineered pillars, {{pits and}} grooves spaced 3, 6, 9 and 12 pm apart were {{fabricated}} on <b>siloxane</b> modified acrylic <b>resin</b> films. The effect of feature size, geometry, and wettability on {{the settlement of}} different algae was evaluated. These films showed various antifouling performances to Ulothrix, Closterium and Navicula. For Navicula (length: 10 - 12 mu m), the feature size and geometry displayed a substantial correlation with the antifouling properties. The film with pillars spaced 3 mu m reduced Navicula settlement by 73 % compared to the control surface. For Closterium (length: 45 - 55 pm), their responses were governed by the same underlying thermodynamic principles as wettability, the largest reduction in Closterium, 81 %, was obtained on the surface with grooves spaced 12 mu m apart. For Ulothrix (length: 5 - 8 mm), the surface also showed the best antifouling performance, the reduction ratio of the settlement on the surface with grooves spaced 12 mu m apart could even reach 92 %. At last, physical fouling deterrent mechanisms for the films with various textures were analyzed in detail. The feature size and geometry display a substantial correlation with the antifouling properties when the size of fouling algae {{is close to the}} textures. With the increasing size for algae, antifouling performance was getting better on surface with pillars or grooves because the algae are bridged between two or more features other than stabilizing its entire mass on one single feature or able to settle between features.
