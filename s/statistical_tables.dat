2500|$|Kierkegaard also {{stresses}} the importance of the self, and the self's relation to the world, as being grounded in self-reflection and introspection. He argued in Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments that [...] "subjectivity is truth" [...] and [...] "truth is subjectivity." [...] This {{has to do with a}} distinction between what is objectively true and an individual's subjective relation (such as indifference or commitment) to that truth. People who in some sense believe the same things may relate to those beliefs quite differently. Two individuals may both believe that many of those around them are poor and deserve help, but this knowledge may lead only one of them to decide to actually help the poor. This is how Kierkegaard put it: [...] "What a priceless invention statistics are, what a glorious fruit of culture, what a characteristic counterpart to the de te narratur fabula [...] of antiquity. Schleiermacher so enthusiastically declares that knowledge does not perturb religiousness, and that the religious person does not sit safeguarded by a lightning rod and scoff at God; yet with the help of <b>statistical</b> <b>tables</b> one laughs at all of life." [...] In other words, Kierkegaard says: [...] "Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor's distance from everyday life – or the learner who should put it to use?" [...] This is how it was summed up in 1940.|$|E

60|$|His Grace {{had been}} a great patron and a zealous {{administrator}} of the New Poor Law. He had been persuaded that it would elevate {{the condition of the}} labouring class.

Lord Everingham overwhelmed him with quotations from Commissioners' rules and Sub-commissioners' reports, <b>statistical</b> <b>tables,</b> and references to dietaries. Sometimes with a strong case, the Duke struggled to make a fight; but Lord Everingham, when he was at fault for a reply, which was very rare, upbraided his father-in-law with the abuses of the old system, and frightened him with visions of rates exceeding rentals.|$|E
60|$|Composite pictures, are, however, {{much more}} than averages; they are rather the {{equivalents}} of those large <b>statistical</b> <b>tables</b> whose totals, divided {{by the number of}} cases, and entered in the bottom line, are the averages. They are real generalisations, because they include the whole of the material under consideration. The blur of their outlines, which is never great in truly generic composites, except in unimportant details, measures the tendency of individuals to deviate from the central type. My argument is, that the generic images that arise before the mind's eye, and the general impressions which are faint and faulty editions of them, are the analogues of these composite pictures which we have the advantage of examining at leisure, and whose peculiarities and character we can investigate, and from which we may draw conclusions that shall throw much light on the nature of certain mental processes which are too mobile and evanescent to be directly dealt with.|$|E
