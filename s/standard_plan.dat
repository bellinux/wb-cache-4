5|$|One of {{the effects}} of the Livonian Crusade in the Baltic was the {{introduction}} of stone and brick fortifications. Although there were hundreds of wooden castles in Prussia and Livonia, the use of bricks and mortar was unknown in the region before the Crusaders. Until the 13th century and start of the 14th centuries, their design was heterogeneous, however this period saw the emergence of a <b>standard</b> <b>plan</b> in the region: a square plan, with four wings around a central courtyard. It was common for castles in the East to have arrowslits in the curtain wall at multiple levels; contemporary builders in Europe were wary of this as they believed it weakened the wall. Arrowslits did not compromise the wall's strength, but it was not until Edward I's programme of castle building that they were widely adopted in Europe.|$|E

The plans are based on recent research to identify laminating processes, resin systems, structural properties of efficient beam cross sections, and preservative treatment processes. The results of these efforts are summarized. The <b>standard</b> <b>plans</b> are based upon nationally recognized allowable strength design methodologies and are for HS- 25 or IML- 80 loads. The <b>standard</b> <b>plans,</b> which are for northern red oak, red maple, and yellow poplar bridges, include details for design and construction of highway bridge superstructures and substructures The <b>standard</b> <b>plans</b> and specifications are being revised. The status of efforts to incorporate design efficiencies suggested by ongoing research and to convert the <b>standard</b> <b>plans</b> to a load resistance factor design basis are also presented...|$|R

25|$|The <b>standard</b> <b>plan</b> of Ottoman {{architecture}} {{was inspired}} {{in part by}} the example of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople/Istanbul, Ilkhanid works like Oljeitu Tomb and earlier Seljuk and Anatolian Beylik monumental buildings and their own original innovations. The most famous of Ottoman architects was (and remains) Mimar Sinan, who lived for approximately one hundred years and designed several hundreds of buildings, of which two of the most important are Süleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul and Selimiye Mosque in Edirne. Apprentices of Sinan later built the famous Blue Mosque in Istanbul and the Taj Mahal in India.|$|E
500|$|Beyond the {{hypostyle}} hall {{were one}} or more peristyle courts open to the sky. These open courts, which had {{been a part of}} Egyptian temple design since the Old Kingdom, became transitional areas in the <b>standard</b> <b>plan</b> of the New Kingdom, lying between the public space outside the temple and the more restricted areas within. Here the public met with the priests and assembled during festivals. At the front of each court was usually a pylon, a pair of broad, flat towers flanking the main gateway. The pylon is known from only scattered examples in the Old and Middle Kingdoms, but in the New it quickly became the distinctive and imposing façade common to most Egyptian temples. The pylon served symbolically as a guard tower against the forces of disorder and may also have been meant to resemble the hieroglyph for [...] "horizon", underscoring the temple's solar symbolism.|$|E
2500|$|All the new station {{buildings}} {{constructed in}} the 1950s and early 1960s for the quadruplication and electrification projects employed a Modernist idiom, but only the platform stations at Graceville (1959) and Chelmer (1959) on the Corinda line, and at Nundah (1960) and Eagle Junction (1963) on the northern line, were designed with butterfly roofs. Similarly designed, but with flat roof profiles were Sherwood (1960), Indooroopilly (late 1950s), Toowong (...) and Milton (1960). Taringa (mid-1950s), Toombul (...) and Wooloowin (1960) were butterfly-roofed overhead stations; Corinda (1960) was a flat-roofed overhead station; and Auchenflower (...) was a skillion-roofed overhead station. A <b>standard</b> <b>plan</b> was drawn up for Nundah and Graceville in 1955, but only Graceville and Chelmer were later constructed with the same pitch to their butterfly roofs. Nundah was given a flatter roof made with steel framing rather than reinforced concrete.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} Egyptian temples were small, impermanent structures, {{but through}} the Old and Middle Kingdoms their designs grew more elaborate, and they were increasingly built out of stone. In the New Kingdom, a basic temple layout emerged, which had evolved from common elements in Old and Middle Kingdom temples. With variations, this plan was used {{for most of the}} temples built from then on, and most of those that survive today adhere to it. In this <b>standard</b> <b>plan,</b> the temple was built along a central processional way that led through a series of courts and halls to the sanctuary, which held a statue of the temple's god. Access to this most sacred part of the temple was restricted to the pharaoh and the highest-ranking priests. The journey from the temple entrance to the sanctuary was seen as a journey from the human world to the divine realm, a point emphasized by the complex mythological symbolism present in temple architecture. [...] Well beyond the temple building proper was the outermost wall. In the space between the two lay many subsidiary buildings, including workshops and storage areas to supply the temple's needs, and the library where the temple's sacred writings and mundane records were kept, and which also served as a center of learning on a multitude of subjects.|$|E

40|$|This study aims {{to throw}} light on {{questions}} of 20 th-century rural housing construction using <b>standard</b> <b>plans</b> with features differing from traditional architecture, and how this was related to lifestyle. Houses built to <b>standard</b> <b>plans</b> are significant {{not only from the}} architectural viewpoint but also as regards modernisation and the changing lifestyle. These houses are often the forerunners of modernisation and innovations, setting a pattern. The state projects in the interwar years were also responses to the deepening social crisis. The ONCSA (National Folk and Family Welfare Fund) movement was undoubtedly the most influential among the construction projects using <b>standard</b> <b>plans</b> in the interwar years, {{not only because of the}} numbers involved (more than 10, 000 houses were built), but also because of the level of preparation and organisation. Construction with state support and using <b>standard</b> <b>plans</b> continued after the Second World War. A number of independent settlements were created in the early 1950 s using these <b>standard</b> <b>plans.</b> Ebes was a typical example of this socialist village-building. From the 1960 s there was a rapid proliferation of a new type of building, the square house that increasingly dominated the appearance of the village street and represented a complete departure from the earlier, traditional architectural forms and types. As a result of the new building types, modernisation and technical development, new objects and implements appeared in material culture, also influencing the lifestyle: it is sufficient to mention lighting, electrical appliances, mains water and modernised forms of heating...|$|R
