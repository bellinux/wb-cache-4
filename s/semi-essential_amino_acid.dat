In this study, a conventional management (CM) and two integrated cotton management strategies (IMS 1, IMS 2) were performed at two soil fertility levels to study the relationships among soil N, N assimilation, embryonic protein accumulation and protein quality. The levels of proteins, essential <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> and <b>semi-essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> especially those of glutamate, lysine, and methionine, were higher in IMS 1 and IMS 2 embryos than in CM embryos.

40|$|AbstractArginine is a <b>semi-essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> {{that serves}} as sole {{substrate}} for enzymes involved in diverse cell processes including redox balance via nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cell proliferation via arginase. Neurons that express nNOS require intracellular arginine to generate nitric oxide (NO). Using a TH+ neuronal cell line (CAD cells), we show that neuronal NO production is largely dependent on extracellular arginine. Although a small intracellular pool exists in CAD cells, the lack of mRNA for argininosuccinate synthase (AS), a rate limiting enzyme for arginine recycling, suggests that intracellular pools are not re-supplied by this mechanism in this sub-class of neurons. Rather, arginine is taken up from the extracellular media by two primary transport systems, the y+ and the y+L systems. The expression of CAT 1, CAT 3, y+LAT 1 and y+LAT 2 mRNAs supports the presence of each system. CAD cell arginine transport is depressed by increased extracellular K+ levels and demonstrates that variations in membrane potential control neuronal arginine uptake. Short term exposure to the oxidizing agents, rotenone and Angeli's salt, but not FeSO 4, increases arginine transport. The regulation of arginine uptake by physiological factors suggests that arginine supply adapts in a moment-to-moment fashion to the changing needs of the neuron...|$|E

BCT- 100, a pegylated recombinant human arginase, can deplete arginine and starve malignant cells of the amino acid. Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia is the most common cancer of childhood, yet for patients with high risk or relapsed disease prognosis remains poor. We show that BCT- 100 is cytotoxic to ALL blasts from patients in vitro by necrosis, and is synergistic in combination with dexamethasone. Against ALL xenografts BCT- 100 leads to a reduction in ALL engraftment and a prolongation of survival. ALL blasts express the arginine transporter CAT- 1, yet the majority of blasts are arginine auxotrophic due to deficiency in either argininosuccinate synthase (ASS) or ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC). Although endogenous upregulation or retroviral transduced increases in ASS or OTC may promote ALL survival under moderately low arginine conditions, expression of these enzymes cannot prevent BCT- 100 cytotoxicity at arginine depleting doses. RNA-sequencing of ALL blasts and supporting stromal cells treated with BCT- 100 identifies a number of candidate pathways which are altered in the presence of arginine depletion. Therefore BCT- 100 provides a new clinically-relevant therapeutic approach to target arginine metabolism in ALL. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved...|$|E

MoCpa 2 is an 1180 -amino acid protein which contains an ATP grasp domain and two CPSase domains. Targeted deletion of MoCPA 2 supported its role in de novo arginine biosynthesis in M. oryzae as mutant phenotypes were complemented by arginine but not ornithine. The ΔMocpa 2 mutant exhibited defects in asexual development and pathogenicity but not appressorium formation.

At pH 4, NVC- 422 completely killed both Escherichia coli and S. aureus within 5 min at a concentration of 32 g/ml. Finally, the effect of NVC- 422 in the treatment of an E. coli-infected granulating wound rat model was evaluated. Treatment of the infected granulating wound wit...|$|E
40|$|Central to {{the basis}} of {{ecological}} immunology are the ideas of costs and trade-offs between immunity and life history traits. As a physical barrier, the insect cuticle provides a key resistance trait, and Tenebrio molitor shows phenotypic variation in cuticular colour that correlates with resistance to the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae. Here we first examined {{whether there is a}} relationship between cuticular colour variation and two aspects of cuticular architecture that we hypothesised may influence resistance to fungal invasion through the cuticle: its thickness and its porosity. Second, we tested the hypothesis that tyrosine, a <b>semi-essential</b> <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> required for immune defence and cuticular melanisation and sclerotisation, can act as a limiting resource by supplementing the larval diet and subsequently examining adult cuticular colouration and thickness. We found that stock beetles and beetles artificially selected for extremes of cuticular colour had thicker less porous cuticles when they were darker, and thinner more porous cuticles when they were lighter, showing that colour co-varies with two architectural cuticular features. Experimental supplementation of the larval diet with tyrosine {{led to the development of}} darker adult cuticle and affected thickness in a sex-specific manner. However, it did not affect two immune traits. The results of this study provide a mechanism for maintenance of cuticular colour variation in this species of beetle; darker cuticles are thicker, but their production is potentially limited by resource constraints and differential investments in resistance mechanisms between the sexes...|$|E

30|$|There {{should be}} a balance between {{excitatory}} <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> and inhibitory <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> after brain injury. Mild hypothermia effectively decreases the damage of the cerebral tissue by reduction of glycerin and excitatory <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> release (Prandini et al. 2005), increases the inhibitory <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (Zhang et al. 2008) to protect neurons. Inhibitory <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> antagonizes the effects of excitatory <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> and mild hypothermia has a clear correlation between them.|$|R
40|$|The {{initiation}} {{of growth of}} a polyaromatic auxotrophic mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was inhibited by several <b>amino</b> <b>acids,</b> whereas growth of the parent prototroph was unaffected. A comparative investigation of <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> transport in the two strains employing 14 C-labeled <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> revealed that the transport of <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> in S. cerevisiae was mediated by a general transport system responsible for the uptake of all neutral as well as basic <b>amino</b> <b>acids.</b> Both auxotrophic and prototrophic strains exhibited stereospecificity for l-amino acids and a Km ranging from 1. 5 × 10 − 5 to 5. 0 × 10 − 5 M. Optimal transport activity occurred at pH 5. 7. Cycloheximide {{had no effect on}} <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> uptake, indicating that protein synthesis was not a direct requirement for <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> transport. Regulation of <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> transport was subject to the concentration of <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> in the free <b>amino</b> <b>acid</b> pool. <b>Amino</b> <b>acid</b> inhibition of the uptake of the aromatic <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> by the aromatic auxotroph did not correlate directly with the effect of <b>amino</b> <b>acids</b> on the {{initiation of}} growth of the auxotroph but provides a partial explanation of this effect...|$|R
