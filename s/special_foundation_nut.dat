40|$|Polarization-resolved edge-emitting {{electroluminescence}} (EL) {{studies of}} InGaN/GaN MQWs of wavelengths from near-UV (390 nm) to blue (468 nm) light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are performed. Although the TE mode is dominant {{in all the}} samples of InGaN/GaN MQW LEDs, an obvious difference of light polarization properties {{is found in the}} InGaN/GaN MQW LEDs with different wavelengths. The polarization degree decreases from 52. 4 % to 26. 9 % when light wavelength increases. Analyses of band structures of InGaN/GaN quantum wells and luminescence properties of quantum dots imply that quantum-dot-like behavior is the dominant reason for the low luminescence polarization degree of blue LEDs, and the high luminescence polarization degree of UV LEDs mainly comes from QW confinement and the strain effect. Therefore, indium induced carrier confinement (quantum-dot-like behavior) might {{play a major role in}} the polarization degree change of InGaN/GaN MQW LEDs from near violet to blue.
