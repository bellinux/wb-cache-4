The eye stolen by Danzo is later used by him to manipulate people for his benefits, including Mifune during the Kage Summit, but it is lost after he commits a suicide attack against Sasuke. The eye given to Itachi, on the other hand, is placed in one of his crows and used to take him out of Kabuto's reanimation jutsu. Itachi then destroys it so it could not be used by anyone again.

In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul. In doing so, Ottavio acted in opposition to the pope's desire to maintain the duchies as papal fiefs, and to Charles, whom he believed responsible for the plot to assassinate Pier Luigi.|$|E
