5000|$|Jericho Park, MD - 20 MW <b>Static</b> <b>Converter.</b> Jericho Park was {{constructed}} {{to replace the}} capacity lost when BG&E declined to renew the Benning rotary converter contract. BG&E proposed a <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> to replace Benning and Jericho Park came on service six years later. It consists of two 10 MW cycloconverter modules supplied by GE. Jericho Park was the first solid-state power supply introduced on the Amtrak network. It suffered from some filtering network problems caused by the highly distorted voltage present on the catenary and was ultimately downgraded from its original design capacity of 25 MW to 22 MVA. Amtrak has requested funding to rehabilitate portions of the converter in an ARRA request. During the twelve-month period that ended in August 2009, the Jericho Park converter used about 70 GWh of energy. Note that SEPTA's <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> plant at Wayne Junction is also based on this technology, although it was supplied by a different company; see SEPTA's 25 Hz Traction Power System.|$|E
50|$|These {{may be an}} {{alternative}} where {{the issue at hand}} is starting a motor, rather than polyphase power itself. The static phase converter is used to start a three-phase motor. The motor then runs on a single phase with a synthesised third pole. However, this makes the power balance, and thus motor efficiency, extremely poor, requiring de-rating the motor (typically to 60% or less). Overheating, and quite often destruction of the motor, will result from failing to do so. (Many manufacturers and dealers specifically state that using a <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> will void any warranty.) An oversized <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> can remove the need to de-rate the motor, but at an increased cost.|$|E

40|$|The Norwegian {{traction}} power {{system is a}} 15 kV single-phase 16 2 / 3 Hz power system. The {{traction power}} system is mainly supplied by rotary frequency converters that convert three-phase 50 Hz power from the utility grid to single-phase 16 2 / 3 Hz power. In recent times, static frequency converters (power electronic converters) have also been introduced. Parts of the traction power system are quite weak; consisting of long, radial lines with high impedance. Since the 1990 s, the introduction of advanced rail vehicles has revealed a poorly damped eigenmode around 1. 6 Hz in the rotary converters used to supply power to the system. In weak parts of the traction power system, the advanced rail vehicles can excite this eigenmode with their fast control systems, creating low frequency voltage oscillations in the traction power system. This thesis presents the work in investigating whether the static converters in the traction power system {{could be used to}} dampen low frequency oscillations and stabilise the traction power system. A central part of the work is the developing a model of a <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> in the PSCAD/EMTDC software, including a control system. For the purpose of recreating the low frequency oscillation problem, a rotary converter is also modelled, modifying synchronous machine models in the PSCAD model library. The traction power system is synchronised with the 50 Hz utility grid, so a control algorithm governing the frequency and phase angle of the <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> is implemented in the <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> control system, to allow both the <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> and rotary converter model to maintain synchronism and operate in parallel. An existing advanced rail vehicle model developed in [4] and implemented in PSCAD in [8] is also added, forming a small model of a traction power system. The model of a <b>static</b> <b>converter,</b> rotary converter and advanced rail vehicle are combined to form a test-bench to study the how the <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> control system can be used to mitigate the low frequency oscillation problem. A Power Oscillation Damping (POD) controller is implemented in the static converter's control system and tested. The <b>static</b> <b>converter</b> is found to provide extra stability to the traction power system when interconnected with a rotary converter, compared to situations were only rotary converters are present in the system, or worse, when a rotary converter operates in stand-alone mode. Implementation of a POD controller was also found to be effective in adding additional damping to the low frequency oscillations, but also revealed potential negative interaction issues with advanced rail vehicles. </p...|$|E
