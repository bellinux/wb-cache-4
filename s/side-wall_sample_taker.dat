40|$|In {{this report}} we {{describe}} the work done at Los Alamos National Laboratory in FY 1995 for the Hydrologic Resources Management Program funded by the US Department of Energy/Nevada Operations office. Budgetary cuts have required us to scale back our activities, particularly field work at the Nevada Test Site. We have collaborated {{with a number of}} government agencies and universities in work related to radionuclide migration through geologic media. In cooperation with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, we have demonstrated the utility of high-sensitivity gamma logging and have successfully improved the design of a bailer routinely used for water sampling. We analyzed a suite of <b>side-wall</b> <b>samples</b> from the BASEBALL drill-back and have interpreted the distribution pattern of test-related radionuclides. Though heterogeneously distributed, they show a general separation of volatile and refractory fractions. The distribution pattern suggests that there has been little movement of radioactive material within this cavity, which is 13 years old and below the static water level. This characterization of the BASEBALL cavity/chimney complex may have important implications for radionuclide migration elsewhere at the Nevada Test Site...|$|R
40|$|All {{women in}} Nijmegen, The Netherlands, with a {{histological}} diagnosis of severe dysplasia, or carcinoma in situ, or invasive carcinoma were investigated {{to see whether}} they had participated in a population screening programme. Within two years of diagnosis of a negative cervical smear, 45 women were found to have histologically confirmed severe epithelial abnormality of the cervix. From the same population as these apparently false negative cases, the number of true positive cases was available, and hence the sensitivity of cervical screening for severe dysplasia, or carcinoma in situ, and invasive carcinoma could be assessed. This was found to be 83 % after two years. The laboratory procedures which led to the high sensitivity for the cervical cytodiagnosis were analysed. Experienced <b>sample</b> <b>takers</b> and cytotechnologists are very important and can reduce sample and screening errors. A good administrative system is necessary to guarantee proper follow up for women with abnormal findings in their cervical smears...|$|R
40|$|During {{summer and}} fall 1998, 75 <b>sample</b> <b>takers</b> and 20 {{employees}} of laboratories of 26 institutes measuring emissions in Germany and Switzerland estimated the uncertainty of measuring results of 5 selected DVI-standard emission measuring methods. The applied method of systematic comparative estimation showed that the estimated total uncertainties U_T of the investigated measuring methods range between 12 % and 21 %. The results of the round robin estimation {{for one of the}} methods (dust measuring 2066 Part 7) with U_T= 15. 4 % are equal to those of the system for simulation of emissions (HLfU Kassel) with 15. 5 %. This confirms the expectation of the initiators of the project that the systematic comparative estimation is useful for the characterization of test methods and hence for the validation of methods.

The SAT, Graduate Record Examination (GRE), and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) compare individual student performance {{to the performance}} of a normative <b>sample.</b> Test <b>takers</b> cannot [...] "fail" [...] a norm-referenced test, as each test taker receives a score that compares the individual to others that have taken the test, usually given by a percentile. This is useful when there is a wide range of acceptable scores, and the goal is to find out who performs better.|$|R

40|$|Background: Developed {{countries}} adopted liquid-based cytology (LBC) cervical cytology, {{partly because}} of its lower proportions of unsatisfactory (U/S) /inadequate samples. This study was carried out to evaluate effect on the rate of U/S samples after introduction of LBC in our laboratory. Materials and Methods: An audit of U/S cervical samples was performed, which included split samples (n = 1000), only conventional Pap smear (CPS) smears (n = 1000), and only LBC samples (n = 1000). The smears were reviewed by two observers independently, and adequacy for the samples was assessed as per The Bethesda System 2001. The reasons for U/S rate in split samples were categorized into various cytologic and/or technical reasons. Results: U/S rate was far less in only LBC samples (1. 2 %) as compared to only CPS (10. 5 %) cases. Cases in the satisfactory but limited category were also less in only LBC (0. 4 %) as compared to only CPS (3. 2 %) samples. The main reasons for U/S smears in split samples were low cell count (37. 2 % in CPS; 58. 8 % in LBC). The second main reason was low cellularity with excess blood and only excess blood in CPS samples. Conclusion: There was a significant reduction of U/S rate in LBC samples as compared to CPS samples, and the difference was statistically significant. The main cause of U/S samples in LBC was low cellularity indicating a technical fault in sample collection. The main cause of U/S rate in CPS was low cellularity followed by low cellularity with excess blood. Adequate training of <b>sample</b> <b>takers</b> and cytologists for the precise cell count to determine adequacy in smears can be of great help in reducing U/S rate...|$|R
40|$|Active {{implementation}} of the education controlling systems into the educational process stipulates the realization of automatic control {{of the level of}} students’ training. In such circumstances, there arises an opportunity to explore integrated means which can be used to evaluate the quality of testing materials. An overview of embedded functions of the Moodle system for test analysis according to statistical characteristics is presented in the article. Empirical studies of the test on a representative <b>sample</b> of test <b>takers</b> help to evaluate the informativity of tasks. The test is formed by such a system of tasks which provides informative assessment of the level and quality of students’ training. Characteristics of the test as a means of pedagogical measuring show the dependence of informational content of the test on the characteristics of test tasks and on the level of students’ training. The work with the "Statistics" module is considered in detail. Pedagogical potential of built-in LMS Moodle services and their use in the educational measurement theory is shown...|$|R
30|$|Standing in {{contrast}} to the results presented here, Furstenberg (2010) finds a statistically significant widening of the black-white SAT gap in California following Prop 209. However, our analysis improves upon his in several ways. First, his College Board sample only includes the 1996 – 2000 cohorts; his paper compares the 1996 – 1997 cohorts to the 1998 – 2000 cohorts. However, interpreting results from 1996 – 1998 is difficult since, as discussed above, the UC Regents first announced their intention to end their use of racial preferences in July 1995. Thus, it is possible that students began responding to the policy change long before 1998, his first post-policy change year. Second, Furstenberg’s data consist of a 30 -percent <b>sample</b> of SAT <b>takers,</b> while we have obtained a more comprehensive dataset containing all Californian test takers, all black and Hispanic test takers nationwide, and a 25 -percent sample of the remaining non-Californian whites. All together, our sample contain 51 percent of test takers during the 1994 to 2001 period. As a result, our estimates are obtained from a much larger sample.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of Zechstein carbonate platform facies is often {{controlled by the}} pre-existing paleo-geography and commonly occur on uplifted fault blocks and along {{the margins of the}} Southern Permian Basin. Present day Zechstein distribution maps suggest that these platform facies are absent along the margins of the Elbow Spit High in the Dutch northern offshore, while based on the general geological setting their presence might be expected. Only several Dutch and UK wells have drilled the Zechstein or older formations in the study area. Well E 02 - 02 and A 16 - 01 have strong positive indicators for the {{presence of}} Zechstein platform facies, with good reservoir characteristics. Well E 02 - 02 drilled a Zechstein platform structure, which was confirmed by a <b>side-wall</b> core <b>sample.</b> A 16 - 01 found stromatolites along the SW margin of the Elbow Spit High, indicating a shallow water environment. Therefore it cannot be ruled out that platform facies exists in a large area along the margins of the Elbow Spit High. This has been investigated with the use of seismic data. First, seismic and petrophysical data will be used to characterize the Zechstein on seismic. That will be used, together with Zechstein analogues from the North-East Netherlands, to identify potential Zechstein platform structures. Second, top and base Zechstein is mapped in great detail and in specific areas the top Zechstein- 3 Anhydrite Member is mapped as well. The identified potential Zechstein platform structures are then compared and compared to the proven E 02 - 02 platform. The results show that the Zechstein Group contains several characteristic seismic properties {{that can be used to}} identify potential Zechstein platform structure, since a low amplitude seems to correlate with Zechstein platform structures. This study illustrates that Zechstein platform facies exists along the western and eastern margins of the Elbow Spit High, away from the wells that encountered this facies. A modified Zechstein distribution map has been proposed showing the areas with Zechstein platform facies along the Elbow Spit High. This map is based on the identified Zechstein platform structures and well data in the study area. Also a new area with possible Zechstein platform facies is proposed, that roughly correlates with the Step High...|$|R
40|$|At the University of California, Los Angeles, the Test of Oral Proficiency (TOP), an {{internally}} developed oral proficiency test, {{is administered}} to international teaching assistant (ITA) candidates to ensure an appropriate level of academic oral English proficiency. Test taker performances are rated live by two raters according to four subscales. While the subscale scores have potential as valuable feedback to major stakeholders, only a weighted {{average of the}} four subscale scores are currently reported and used. This study presents a way of extracting valuable information from the TOP subscale scores. In particular, it investigates an approach to obtaining oral English proficiency profiles based on the subscale score patterns of 960 TOP test takers. This study utilized item response theory and finite mixture modeling to investigate profiles of academic oral English proficiency {{in terms of the}} TOP subscales. A higher-order generalization of the graded response model was formulated to estimate subscale scores that accounted for structural dependencies and rater effects in the observed TOP scores. The estimated scores were clustered using a multivariate normal mixture model to yield subscale score profiles. The mixture model suggested seven profile groups and classified the TOP test takers into the seven groups. The profile groups were then interpreted and labeled based on characteristic score patterns and linguistic background shared by group members. To achieve a thorough understanding of the resulting profiles, discourse features of test <b>taker</b> performances <b>sampled</b> from different profile groups were closely examined. A small corpus was constructed based on the <b>sampled</b> test <b>taker</b> performances and compared to a reference corpus to explore the overall pattern of TOP test takers' language use. The comparison showed that the TOP test takers tended to use relatively fewer function words than speakers in the reference corpus. Characteristic features of each profile group's discourse were investigated through an identification and examination of discourse organizing lexical bundles. The results suggested that the use of metadiscourse and textual reference bundles with an explicit past reference point might be related to test takers' academic oral English proficiency...|$|R
