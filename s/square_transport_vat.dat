40|$|In this study, an {{improved}} error metric for morphodynamic models is introduced. Cur-rent error metrics, like the classical (Root) Mean Squared Error (RMSE), assume that predictions can be properly validated against observations by regarding the point-wise difference in bed level. This analysis inherently has {{the problem that}} phase differences of bottom features are not recognized, such that a misplaced feature is penalised twice, the so called double penalty effect. To reduce the double penalty effect, Bosboom and Reniers (2014) formulated errors metrics based on an optimal smooth displacement field between predictions and obser-vations. Since the employed image warping technique moves pixels rather than sand, sediment continuity is not guaranteed. To overcome this limitation, this study presents an error metric based on the effective (net) sediment transport difference between predic-tion and observation including a recipe to compute it: the Root Mean <b>Squared</b> <b>Transport</b> Error (RMSTE).

Understanding the origin of anomalous transport is essential, because it determines the likelihood of high-impact, low-probability events and therefore exerts a dominant control over the predictability of a system. The origin of anomalous transport, however, remains a matter of debate. In this thesis, we first investigate the pore-scale origin of anomalous transport through sandstone. From high-resolution (micron-scale) 3 D numerical flow and transport simula-tion, we find that transport at the pore scale is markedly anomalous. We demonstrate that this anomalous behavior originates from the intermittent structure of the velocity field at the pore scale, which in turn emanates from the interplay between velocity heterogeneity and velocity correlation.

This {{call for papers}} theme acknowledges the broader role that communication design plays in the way public spaces are defined, designed and managed. Areas for exploration may include - though not exclusively - design against crime, counter-terrorism, regeneration, emergency services and health and well-being. 'Public space' is defined broadly to suggest not only those 'open' spaces that are freely accessible (e. g. streets, town <b>squares,</b> parks, <b>transport</b> hubs), but also 'interior' public service spaces (e. g. hospitals, civic buildings, shopping centres).

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} issues and problems of the Åland Islands related to European integration and globalisation. These are migration (essay 1), competition in the domestic (local) market of Åland (essays 2 and 3), and the economy-wide consequences of changes in shipping and alcohol policy in the Nordic countries and in the European Union (essay 4). The analyses are conducted with an econometric examination of micro level data (essays 1 and 2) and with a dynamic applied general equilibrium model (essays 3 and 4) that was constructed {{during the course of}} this study. Essay 1 examines the characteristics of migration flows to and from the Åland Islands. Estimated migration equations are well in line with the current theories and earlier empirical results. In addition, it is shown that the local unemployment rate affects mainly the migration tendency of non-natives. However, the probability of living in Åland has a decreasing time trend for native Ålanders, while the opposite is true for the persons born in mainland Finland. Essay 2 tries to explain the high price level of groceries in Åland by comparing individual price observations in Åland to those in the southwestern part of mainland Finland. Lack of scale economies, as well as high concentration levels in retailing and in the food processing industry, are some of the suggested explanations. In addition, <b>transport</b> costs and <b>VAT</b> border administration are Åland-specific, yet minor factors in raising prices. There are not many policy options available for rectifying the situation, but added competition in the local market through relaxed entry barriers could be one measure. Essay 3 introduces a dynamic imperfect competition CGE model. One of the major contributions of the model is the introduction of migration that makes economic growth endogenous in the model. An increase in the threat of entry from outside the home region is simulated with the model. This would increase the concentration of local industries, but also would increase consumer welfare. Essay 4 studies the economy-wide consequences of changes in shipping and alcohol policy of the EU and the Nordic countries. The Finnish Government’s decision to increase subsidies to shipping from 2005 onward seems to compensate quite well for the decreased profitability of tax-free sales onboard.

40|$|The {{surf zone}} {{is defined by}} highly non-linear, {{breaking}} waves that have very different acceleration signatures beneath their respective crests and troughs. The consequences of this dissimilarity on sediment transport is not fully understood. This thesis develops methodologies to predict sediment transport under these asymmetric, skewed waves. Two different transport mechanisms are considered: bedload transport and "subsurface" transport. The potential for subsurface transport was first realized by Madsen (1974) who found that the large pressure gradient beneath a breaking wave was sufficient to drive a substantial porous-media flow, adequate to create a soil-mechanics type failure extending several centimeters into a sandy sediment bed. The theoretical model of Madsen (1974) is extended to obtain estimates of subsurface transport by subdividing the sediment in failure into distinct, kinematically admissible slip circles. An equation governing the rotation of each slip circle is developed, yielding the subsurface sediment's horizontal movement {{as a function of}} depth. By integration, subsurface transport can predicted. In addition, a method is developed for estimating bedload transport under breaking waves, accounting for the enhanced shear stress beneath the wave's crest. An existing bedload formula is used as the foundation for this predictive model. (cont.) The validity of the two predictive models is substantiated by experiments conducted in a laboratory wave flume. Breaking waves are passed over lightweight, plastic beads representive of uncohesive sediment. The surficial and subsurface transport is experimentally measured. Using velocity records from the laboratory waves, the theoretical models are used to make predictions of each type of transport. Both models produce good agreement with experimental observations. Finally, laboratory wave data from Madsen (1974) are scaled to the the size of waves typical of the surf zone. Using parameters characteristic of sand, the two models predict a subsurface transport of the same order as bedload transport for typical wave and sediment parameters. Furthermore, subsurface transport is found to be proportional to the characteristic length scale of the wave <b>squared,</b> while bedload <b>transport</b> is proportional to the length scale to the power of 1. 5. by William McKinney Durham.

Understanding the origin of anomalous transport is essential, because it determines the likelihood of high-impact, low-probability events and therefore exerts a dominant control over the predictability of a system. The origin of anomalous transport, however, remains a matter of debate. In this thesis, we first investigate the pore-scale origin of anomalous transport through sandstone. From high-resolution (micron-scale) 3 D numerical flow and transport simulation, we find that transport at the pore scale is markedly anomalous. We demonstrate that this anomalous behavior originates from the intermittent structure of the velocity field at the pore scale, which in turn emanates from the interplay between velocity heterogeneity and velocity correlation. Finally, we propose a continuous time random walk (CTRW) model that honors this intermittent structure at the pore scale and captures the anomalous 3 D transport behavior at the macroscale. To show the generality of our finding, we study transport through lattice networks with quenched disorder. We again observe anomalous transport originating from the interplay between velocity heterogeneity and velocity correlation. We extend the developed CTRW model to capture the full multidimensional particle transport dynamics for {{a broad range of}} network heterogeneities and for both advection- and diffusion-dominated flow regimes. We then study anomalous transport through fractured rock at the field-scale. We show that the interplay between heterogeneity and correlation in controlling anomalous transport can be quantified by combining convergent and push-pull tracer tests because flow reversibility is strongly dependent on correlation, whereas late-time scaling of breakthrough curves is mainly controlled by velocity heterogeneity. Our transport model captures the anomalous behavior in the breakthrough curves for both push-pull and convergent flow geometries, with the same set of parameters. Moreover, the inferred flow correlation length shows qualitative agreement with geophysical measurements. Thus, the proposed correlated CTRW modeling approach furnishes a simple yet powerful framework for characterizing the impact of flow correlation and heterogeneity on transport in porous and fractured media. Finally, we propose a joint flow-seismic inversion methodology for characterizing fractured reservoirs. Traditionally, seismic interpretation of subsurface structures is performed without any account of flow behavior. With the proposed methodology, we reduce the uncertainty by integrating dynamic flow measurements into the seismic interpretation, and improve the predictability of reservoir models by this joint use of seismic and flow data. This work opens up many possibilities of combining geophysical and flow information for improving subsurface characterization. by Peter Kyungchul Kang. Thesis: Ph.
