40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to define, in a natural way, an <b>order</b> <b>relation</b> on the set of antichains of an ordered set. Thus, the set of finite antichains becomes a sup-lattice. If moreover, the given ordered set is a <b>strictly</b> <b>ordered</b> {{commutative}} monoid, the finite antichains constitute also an ordered monoid. In 3, an ultrametric distance is introduced; it has values in the partially ordered set of finite antichains. This distance appears naturally in the study of rings of generalized power series. It will be used in a forthcoming paper (with Sibylla Prieβ-Crampe) concerning fixed points of contracting maps. Antichains have also been considered in the study of Gröbner bases, where they appear under names like "crowns" and it is likely that the present results will be useful in that context. By its simplicity, it is also expected that use of these ideas will be found in the theory of ordered sets and their applications...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{counting}} the number of popular matchings in a given instance. A popular matching instance consists of agents A and houses H, where each agent ranks a subset of houses according to their preferences. A matching is an assignment of agents to houses. A matching M is more popular than matching M' if the number of agents that prefer M to M' is more than {{the number of people that}} prefer M' to M. A matching M is called popular if there exists no matching more popular than M. McDermid and Irving gave a poly-time algorithm for {{counting the number of}} popular matchings when the preference lists are <b>strictly</b> <b>ordered.</b> We first consider the case of ties in preference lists. Nasre proved that {{the problem of}} counting the number of popular matching is #P-hard when there are ties. We give an FPRAS for this problem.
