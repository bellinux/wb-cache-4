25|$|Large {{quantities}} of polar molecules such as pyridine are {{absorbed into the}} bulk phase and not simply on the surface. <b>Solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>NMR</b> studies of ethanol absorbed in the bulk phase show that both protonated dimers, ((C2H5OH)2H+) and monomers, (C2H5OH2+) are present.|$|E
25|$|The analyte {{molecules}} {{in a sample}} can be partially ordered {{with respect to the}} external magnetic field of the spectrometer by manipulating the sample conditions. Common techniques include addition of bacteriophages or bicelles to the sample, or preparation of the sample in a stretched polyacrylamide gel. This creates a local environment that favours certain orientations of nonspherical molecules. Normally in solution NMR the dipolar couplings between nuclei are averaged out because of the fast tumbling of the molecule. The slight overpopulation of one orientation means that a residual dipolar coupling remains to be observed. The dipolar coupling is commonly used in <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>NMR</b> and provides information about the relative orientation of the bond vectors relative to a single global reference frame. Typically the orientation of the N-H vector is probed in a HSQC like experiment. Initially, residual dipolar couplings were used for refinement of previously determined structures, but attempts at de novo structure determination have also been made.|$|E
25|$|Saturation of {{the sample}} with energy applied at the {{resonant}} radiofrequency. This manifests in both CW and pulsed NMR; {{in the first case}} (CW) this happens by using too much continuous power that keeps the upper spin levels completely populated; in the second case (pulsed), each pulse (that is at least a 90° pulse) leaves the sample saturated, and four to five times the (longitudinal) relaxation time (5T1) must pass before the next pulse or pulse sequence can be applied. For single pulse experiments, shorter RF pulses that tip the magnetization by less than 90° can be used, which loses some intensity of the signal, but allows for shorter recycle delays. The optimum there is called an Ernst angle, after the Nobel laureate. Especially in <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> <b>NMR,</b> or in samples with very few nuclei with spins greater than zero, (diamond with the natural 1% of carbon-13 is especially troublesome here) the longitudinal relaxation times can be on the range of hours, while for proton-NMR they are more on the range of one second.|$|E

The most surprising result is the high occurrence of opaline silica as a component in these kidney stones. Opaline silica is a scarce mineral phase in renal calcification; however, we found that at least 48 % of the stones had a detectable proportion of silica. SEM images demonstrate the presence of micrometric objects (of spheroidal shape) in close association with monohydrated calcium oxalate crystals. X-ray fluorescence, XRD and 29 Si <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> MAS <b>NMR</b> demonstrate unambiguously the presence of amorphous silica, whose composition is comparable to that of natural opals.

40|$|Diltiazem {{is a drug}} used as a {{calcium channel}} blocker in the {{treatment}} of cardiovascular disorders. Because of poor aqueous solubility of the drug, hydrochloride salt has been marketed. Due to the short elimination half-life of diltiazem, extended-release formulations were developed. In the present work, the crystal engineering approach has been employed to obtain diltiazem forms with lower water solubility by treating with carboxylic acids. Three molecular salts of diltiazem with aspirin, niacin and L-malic acid were synthesized and characterized by a single crystal and powder XRD, DTA, <b>solid</b> <b>state</b> CP-MAS, <b>NMR</b> and UV/vis techniques. The single crystal structure determination allowed us to study supramolecular structures and proton transfer interactions from carboxylic acids to diltiazem in the <b>solid</b> <b>state,</b> while <b>NMR</b> studies – interaction in solution.
