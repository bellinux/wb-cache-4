25|$|The {{activity}} of the PAM enzyme system is dependent upon vitamin C (ascorbate), which is a necessary vitamin cofactor.

25|$|Relatively {{large doses}} of ascorbic acid may cause indigestion, {{particularly}} when taken {{on an empty}} stomach. However, taking vitamin C {{in the form of}} <b>sodium</b> <b>ascorbate</b> and calcium ascorbate may minimize this effect. When taken in large doses, ascorbic acid causes diarrhea in healthy subjects. In one trial in 1936, doses of up to 6grams of ascorbic acid were given to 29 infants, 93 children of preschool and school age, and 20 adults for more than 1400 days. With the higher doses, toxic manifestations were observed in five adults and four infants. The signs and symptoms in adults were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, flushing of the face, headache, fatigue and disturbed sleep. The main toxic reactions in the infants were skin rashes.|$|E

40|$|The enzyme 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylate (ACC) oxidase was {{extracted}} in a soluble {{form from}} mesocarp of ripe cherimoya fruit. ACC oxidase purification to near homogeneity {{was carried out}} in three chromatographic steps: anion exchange, chromatofocusing, and gel filtration. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 66 kDa by gel filtration, 62 kDa by native PAGE, and 35 kDa by SDS-PAGE, indicating that the enzyme could be active as a dimer. An isoelectric point at pH 4. 35 was estimated by chromatofocusing. The activity of semipurified enzyme eluted from Mono Q columns required Fe 2 +, <b>sodium</b> bicarbonate, and <b>ascorbate</b> (Km = 6. 5 mM). The pH optimum was at 7. 4 and the apparent Km with respect to ACC was 82 μM in the absence of added sodium bicarbonate (194 μM in the presence bicarbonate).

40|$|Fifty-six {{tuberculosis}} {{patients and}} twenty-eight control subjects were evaluated {{in a comprehensive}} investigation of cellular and humoral immune function in pulmonary TB. The patient group showed {{significantly higher levels of}} secretory IgA and serum IgG, IgA and IgM than did the control group but 7 % of patients displayed a selective secretory IgA deficiency. Levels of alpha- 1 -antitrypsin were also significantly higher in the patient group. There {{were no significant differences in}} levels of total haemolytic complement, C' 3 and C' 4. In moderate to moderately advanced TB patients there were no significant differences in T and B cell numbers nor in mitogen-induced lymphocyte transformation and lymphokine production, when compared with the control group. The range of PPD-induced lymphocyte transformation and lymphokine production levels encountered was similar in both groups although certain patients did not respond to the PPD antigen. Neutrophils from TB patients showed increased random motility in vitro but eight out of ten patients showed impaired directed motility (chemotaxis). Phagocytic and anti-microbial functions were normal in the patient group. The neutrophil chemotactic defect was reversible and could be corrected in vitro when the patients' cells were treated with <b>sodium</b> and calcium <b>ascorbate,</b> levamisole, metoprolol and propranolol...|$|R
40|$|After their random -llocation to one {{of three}} {{treatment}} aroups, 622 volunteers received either vitamin C or placebo in a maintenance dose of 500 mg once weekly and a therapeutic dose of 1500 mg daily on the 1 st day and 1000 mg on the next 4 days of any illness. Two forms of vitamin C were employed: a sustained-release capsule containing ascorbic acid and a regular tabet containing a mixture of <b>sodium</b> and calcium <b>ascorbate.</b> In the 448 subjects who completed an average of 15 weeks in the study of total of 635 episodes of illness were recroded. Respiratory symptoms were recorded on at least 1 day in 92 per cent of these episodes. There were no consistent or significant differences in the sickness experience of the subjects receiving the sustained-release vitamin capsules compared to those receiving the vitamin tablets, but subjects in both vitamin groups experienced less severe illness than subjects in the placebo group, with approximately 25 per cent fewer days spent indoors because of the illness (P smaller than 0. 05). These results are compatible with the belief that supplementary vitamin C can reduce the burden of winter illness, but the intake need not be as high as has sometimes been claimed...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{phenolic}} compounds and {{plant growth regulator}} has been proposed, to reduce {{the negative effects of}} stress. Salicylic acid is a substance that causes plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. This experiment was conducted in Zabol University during 2013 as factorial randomized complete block design with 3 replications. Factors included 4 levels of lead nitrate; 0 (control), 100, 200 and 300 mg per kg of soil and foliar application of salicylic acid at 3 levels of 0, 50 and 100 ppm. Addition of lead significantly reduced concentrations of potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphorous and nitrogen and increased concentrations of <b>sodium,</b> polyphenol oxidase, <b>ascorbate</b> peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and peroxidase. In addition, salicylic acid spraying had a significant influence on all traits, and salicylic acid spraying at 100 mL/L increased concentrations of potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, nitrogen and decreased concentrations of polyphenol oxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and peroxidase. In this study the interaction between salicylic acid and lead on potassium, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, nitrogen, sodium and catalase, guaiacol peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase were significant, and salicylic acid play moderating role and reducing the negative effects of lead toxicity. The results suggested salicylic acid application in basil can increase uptake of macro and micro nutrients required for plant growth and reduce the negative effects of stress lead-induced oxidative damage...|$|R

2500|$|Vitamin C is {{available}} in tablets, capsules, drink mix packets, in multi-vitamin/mineral formulations, in antioxidant formulations, and as crystalline powder. Tablet and capsule content ranges from 25mg to 1500mg per serving. The most commonly used compounds are ascorbic acid and <b>sodium</b> <b>ascorbate.</b> Timed release versions are available, as are formulations containing bioflavonoids such as quercetin, hesperidin, and rutin. In some countries, vitamin C as ascorbic acid crystals {{is available}} in bottles containing 300g to 1kg of powder.
