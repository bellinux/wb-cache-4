5|$|Noctilucent {{clouds are}} known to exhibit high radar reflectivity, in a {{frequency}} range of 50MHz to 1.3GHz. This behaviour is not well understood but a {{possible explanation is that}} the ice grains become coated with a thin metal film composed of sodium and iron, which makes the cloud far more reflective to radar, although this explanation remains controversial. Sodium and iron atoms are stripped from incoming micrometeors and <b>settle</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> layer just above the altitude of noctilucent clouds, and measurements have shown that these elements are severely depleted when the clouds are present. Other experiments have demonstrated that, at the extremely cold temperatures of a noctilucent cloud, sodium vapour can rapidly be deposited onto an ice surface.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} are mirror-image duplicates of others, and others die before having {{to make all the}} choices in their ruleset, leaving 411 {{distinct}} species (412 if the infinite straight-line worm is included). 336 of these species eventually die. 73 patterns exhibit infinite behaviour, that is, they <b>settle</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> repeating pattern that does not return to the origin. A further two are strongly believed to be infinite and one remains unsolved. Eleven of the rules exhibit complicated behaviour. They do not die even after many billions of iterations, nor do they adopt an obviously infinite pattern. Their ultimate fate was unknown until 2003 when Benjamin Chaffin developed new methods of solving them. After many hours of computer time, nine of the eleven rules were solved, leaving the worms with rules {1,0,4,2,0,2,0} and {1,0,4,2,0,1,5}. The first of these was solved by Tomas Rokicki, who determined that it halts after 57 trillion timesteps, leaving only {1,0,4,2,0,1,5} unsolved. According to Rokicki, the worm is still active after 5.21019 timesteps. He used an algorithm based on Bill Gosper's Hashlife to simulate the worms at extraordinary speeds. This behaviour is considerably more complex than the related rectangular grid worm, which has a longest path of only 16 segments.|$|E

25|$|Under Dhoni's captaincy, India won the 2011 World Cup. In {{the final}} against Sri Lanka, chasing 275, Dhoni {{promoted}} himself up the batting order, coming before an in form Yuvraj Singh. When {{he came to}} bat India needed more than six runs per over with three top order batsmen already dismissed. He started building a good partnership with Gautam Gambhir. Due to good strokeplay and active running between wickets, they kept up with the required run rate. Dhoni was on 60 off 60 balls, but later accelerated with a greater flow of boundaries, ending with 91 not out off 79 balls. Befitting the occasion, he finished the match of in style with a huge six over long-on off bowler Nuwan Kulasekara and won Man of the Match. Later in the post-match presentation, {{he admitted that he}} came up the order so as to counter the Muralitharan spin threat as he was very familiar with Murali's bowling, who was his team-mate in the Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Chennai Super Kings. He had come after the dismissal of Virat Kohli, also a right-handed batsman. By partnering the left-handed Gambhir, he ensured a right-left combination at the crease that makes it difficult for bowlers to <b>settle</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> rhythm.|$|E
25|$|Phil {{proposes to}} his girlfriend Suzy Branning (Maggie O'Neill) when she falsely claims that she is pregnant. Phil does not believe his friend, Shirley Carter (Linda Henry), when she tells him that Suzy is conning him; he stays with Suzy until he discovers she has schemed with his malevolent uncle, Archie (Larry Lamb). Although troubled by lapses in {{alcoholism}} due to numerous family upsets, Phil begins to <b>settle</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> relationship with Shirley, who becomes a mother figure for Ben and Louise, who is staying with Phil while Lisa is away. Phil is parted from both his children in 2010: Ben is sent to a juvenile offenders' unit for attacking Jordan Johnson (Michael-Joel David Stuart) and Louise returns to her mother, and then disappears after Lisa promises Phil can have contact at any time. Depressed, Phil starts {{a sexual relationship with}} drug addict Rainie Cross (Tanya Franks) and starts using crack cocaine, developing an addiction. Peggy locks him inside her home so he cannot have access to drugs, but, suffering withdrawal symptoms, he escapes and confronts Peggy, setting the pub on fire. Within minutes, the pub is ablaze and the roof collapses on Phil. He is rescued and Peggy leaves the next day, realising he is better off without her.|$|E
500|$|During the day, the {{reticulate}} whipray {{is generally}} inactive and spends much time resting motionless {{on the sea}} floor, sometimes buried in sand. In Shark Bay, Western Australia, this ray can be found resting singly or in small groups in very shallow water during high tide. Its lateral line extends {{to the tip of}} its extremely long tail, giving it advance warning of approaching predators such as bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) and hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna). The cowtail stingray (Pastinachus sephen) prefers to rest with the reticulate whipray over others of its own species, because the whiprays' longer tails grant them superior predator detection. These mixed-species groups often <b>settle</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> [...] "rosette" [...] with their tails pointing radially outward for maximum predator awareness.|$|E

[...] However, since he joined the club partway into the new season, he initially {{found it difficult to}} take over as first-choice goalkeeper. Gunn had been bought as a replacement for England international goalkeeper Chris Woods, who had moved to Rangers F.C. Meanwhile, reserve team keeper Graham Benstead made a series of good performances and Norwich were top of the league. Ken Brown wanted to be fair to Benstead and made Gunn wait. A 6–2 defeat at Anfield proved to be the catalyst for Gunn's promotion to the first team. He made his debut in a Full Members Cup win against Coventry City, conceding a penalty, and made his league debut in a 2–1 victory against Tottenham Hotspur at Carrow Road on 8 November 1986.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Anderson {{published}} her sixth novel, Taking Shelter. Set in Sydney in {{the winter}} of 1986, the novel's focus is twenty-one-year-old Beth Jeams and her relationships. Overwhelmed by her six half brothers, Beth travels to Sydney at the request of her cousin, Kyrie. Although she is engaged to Miles Ligard, a twenty-nine-year-old lawyer, {{at the beginning of the}} novel, he eventually admits that he is gay, and Beth leaves him. Almost immediately she meets and begins a relationship with Marcus Pirie, whom she discovers she had met in Rome when they were both children. When Beth discovers that she is pregnant, she and Marcus <b>settle</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> house owned by Juliet McCracken, who calls herself Miles' [...] "spare old godmother." [...] In fact, Juliet performs the role of fairy-godmother to a number characters in the novel, including Beth and Marcus; Elaine Barry suggests that this, along with Anderson's [...] "use of coincidence, dreams, [...] superficially happy ending," [...] makes Taking Shelter [...] "almost a parody of popular romantic fiction." ...|$|E
500|$|Joe Morgenstern from The Wall Street Journal {{wrote that}} the movie manages to keep a hold on its audience's attention. He thought that Douglas {{measured}} up to Gekko's standards in the film, believing {{that he was the}} only actor to sustain a [...] "sense of nasty fun", and felt that LaBeouf's effectiveness was within the range of the film-maker's direction, but was unimpressed with Brolin's portrayal of James. He concluded that the script takes an unconvincing jab at Gekko's [...] "spiritual regeneration," [...] which was due to a scene that he considered to be [...] "inherently illogical and emotionally inert." [...] The Daily Telegraphs David Gritten said that Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps lacked the [...] "punch" [...] of the original film and was annoyed by the number of cameos throughout the film. Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps received three out of five stars from Stephen Lambrechts of IGN Australia. Lambrechts felt that Stone's growth as a film director might mirror Gekko's as a person; having had used time to calm down over the years and <b>settle</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> more relaxed state of being. He concluded that the film's final result is not [...] "quite the incendiary attack that it could have been, but it still has plenty to say while also managing to be an entertaining crowd pleaser." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{two most}} common forms of herpes {{are caused by}} {{infection}} with herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV-1 is typically acquired orally and causes cold sores, HSV-2 is usually acquired during sexual contact and affects the genitals, however either strain may affect either site. Some people are asymptomatic or have very mild symptoms. Those that do experience symptoms usually notice them 2 to 20 days after exposure which last 2 to 4 weeks. Symptoms can include small fluid-filled blisters, headaches, backaches, itching or tingling sensations in the genital or anal area, pain during urination, Flu like symptoms, swollen glands, or fever. Herpes is spread through skin contact with a person infected with the virus. The virus affects the areas where it entered the body. This can occur through kissing, vaginal intercourse, oral sex or anal sex. The virus is most infectious during times when there are visible symptoms, however those who are asymptomatic can still spread the virus through skin contact. The primary attack is the most severe because the body {{does not have any}} antibodies built up. After the primary attack, one might have recurring attacks that are milder or might not even have future attacks. There is no cure for the disease but there are antiviral medications that treat its symptoms and lower the risk of transmission (Valtrex). Although HSV-1 is typically the [...] "oral" [...] version of the virus, and HSV-2 is typically the [...] "genital" [...] version of the virus, a person with HSV-1 orally CAN transmit that virus to their partner genitally. The virus, either type, will <b>settle</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> nerve bundle either {{at the top of the}} spine, producing the [...] "oral" [...] outbreak, or a second nerve bundle at the base of the spine, producing the genital outbreak.|$|E
