5|$|A {{sequel to}} Resurrection was planned as Joss Whedon had written an earth-set script for Alien 5, though Sigourney Weaver was not {{interested}} in this setting, but has remained open to reprise her role as Ellen Ripley for a fifth installment on the condition that <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> story. Although more sequels were planned to follow Resurrection, the series became a prequel series with the 2012 film Prometheus directed by Ridley Scott, who stated that the film precedes the story of Alien, but is not directly connected to the original film's franchise, and that Prometheus explores its own mythology and ideas.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, TGS star Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is {{informed}} by Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell) that he has health problems as Tracy has a weakened system only found on dead people. Tracy and his wife Angie Jordan (Sherri Shepherd) meet with Jack and Tracy reveals what Dr. Spaceman told him. Angie becomes concerned {{on whether or not}} their family will be taken care of after Tracy dies. Jack offers Angie a job in the entertainment business, and takes the opportunity to get even with Liz by assigning Angie as Liz's intern. Liz realizes that Angie's new job is Jack's way of messing with her, and explains to Angie that as her intern she is not getting paid and fires her. Angie gets upset with Jack and Liz but Jack offers her a reality show during TGSs time slot unless Liz signs the divorce papers. Liz, however, still refuses—even admitting <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> concept of a reality show starring Angie and would watch it. To get back at Jack, Liz holds a press conference and announces that she and Jack have decided to donate $5million to The Jack and Elizabeth Donaghy High School for Teen Drama, The Arts, and Feelings. The next day, Jack and Liz have a sit down meeting with NBC Human resource mediator Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane) to discuss their marriage as NBC has strict anti-nepotism guidelines. During the meeting, the two realize that they have had the longest and most meaningful relationship either of them has ever had, and apologize to each other with Liz agreeing to sign the divorce papers and Jack promising to restore TGSs budget.|$|E
25|$|Chibiusa's {{dream is}} to one day become a real lady, to have her own prince, and {{to be friends with}} {{everyone}} she knows. Meanwhile, she is a fairly ordinary little girl; <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> colour pink and red, pudding, pancakes, and rabbits. Her favorite school subject is drawing, while her least favorites are language classes. Her least favorite food is listed in the manga as carrots, just like Usagi, but they both eat them in the anime. Chibiusa hates taking care of the house and is afraid of such things as thunder and lightning, ghosts, vampires, dentists, and needles. She also likes to collect things with rabbits on them, and belongs to the Gardening Committee at school. She is very short when she first appears, but grows slightly taller as she gets older.|$|E

In this encounter, Hemingway specifically emphasizes how the wife [...] "likes" [...] the innkeeper, a word that is repeated often throughout the stories of In Our Time: [...] "The wife <b>liked</b> him. <b>She</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> deadly serious way he received any complaints. <b>She</b> <b>liked</b> his dignity. <b>She</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> way he wanted to serve her. <b>She</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> way he felt about being a hotel-keeper. <b>She</b> <b>liked</b> his old, heavy face and big hands".|$|R

25|$|Miss Lucilla Edith Cavell Teatime is a ladylike conwoman whose {{occasional}} lapses into verbal vulgarity {{make her}} all the more endearing. She has a liking for whisky, a game of dominoes and all things tasteful. She first steps off the train in Flaxborough (a town once described as having the fictional solidarity of Arnold Bennett's Five Towns) in the fourth mystery set there, Lonelyheart 4122. <b>She</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> town {{so much that she}} settles there, even though her attempt at swindling through a lonely-hearts bureau nearly makes her the third woman killed by another swindler. She appears in all subsequent Flaxborough novels except Blue Murder. By the eleventh volume, Plaster Sinners, she is the proprietress of the 'House of Yesteryear' in Northgate, Flaxborough, and a regular attender at local auctions. Her old talents and sleight of hand remain much in evidence. On one occasion two glass decanters are rendered extremely cheap when she casually transfers the stoppers to a tray of miscellaneous items, which she then bids for as well. Her final appearance is in Whatever's Been Going On At Mumblesby? where we find her with an assistant called Edgar and offering opinions on the marketability of such religious relics as saints' kneecaps. In the 1977 Murder Most English BBC television series, which offered adaptations of four of Colin Watson's Flaxborough novels, Lucy Teatime was portrayed by Brenda Bruce.|$|E
500|$|... "The Phone Message" [...] gained {{positive}} {{responses from}} critics. Jerry's dumping Donna because <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> commercial has been frequently cited {{as an example}} of how the show's central characters would often break up with people for [...] "fantastically insignificant reasons". In a 1998 article, the staff of South Carolina newspaper The State cited [...] "The Phone Message" [...] as [...] "the first episode that made an impression on [...] ", referring to Seinfeld as [...] "the comedic version of Hill Street Blues." [...] Entertainment Weekly critics Mike Flaherty and Mary Kaye Schilling graded the episode with a B+, calling it [...] "the first of two consecutive and classic George angst-fests, as Jason Alexander—master of frantic venom—begins to make the character his own." ...|$|E
500|$|Joss Whedon {{had written}} an Earth-set script for Alien 5, {{a sequel to}} Alien Resurrection, but Sigourney Weaver was not {{interested}} in this setting and sought to return the story to the planetoid from the first film. Weaver has remained open to a role in a fifth installment on the condition that <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> story. Before 20th Century Fox greenlit Alien vs. Predator, James Cameron had been collaborating on the plot for a fifth Alien film with another writer. Learning of Fox's plans for a crossover, he ceased work on his concept. Before he saw the film, Cameron had stated that it would [...] "kill the validity of the franchise", and that [...] "it was Frankenstein Meets Werewolf" [...] – like [...] "Universal just taking their assets and starting to play them off against each other". Although he later admitted to liking Alien vs. Predator, Cameron ruled out any future involvement with the series.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{lyrics are}} written in second person, {{a message from the}} singer to her ex-boyfriend {{detailing}} the hurt he caused her while they were dating. The refrain is a list of the seven traits the singer [...] "hates" [...] most about her ex, with the seventh item being her frustration that despite his flaws, he makes her love him. Ben Ratliff of The New York Times noted that the list actually [...] "runs to 8 to 11 things, depending on how you parse it". Henry Freedland of Paste magazine compared it to a similar list featured as a poem in the 1999 film 10 Things I Hate About You. In one verse, Cyrus asks for a sincere apology and states, [...] "If you text it, I'll delete it", which Molly Lambert of The New York Times said [...] "perfectly captur our confusing age of technologically mediated courtship." [...] The song concludes with a variation of the refrain, in which Cyrus names the seven things <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> most about her ex, again concluding with [...] "you make me love you".|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the episode is one of Fey's {{favorite}} words, which she used multiple times when she appeared as an anchor on the Saturday Night Live sketch Weekend Update. Fey explains that <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> word because [...] "it's {{one of the least}} graphic ways to describe the female genitals". This episode marks the final appearance of Edie Falco, who was hired for a three-episode arc. Falco made her debut in the episode [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] as Celeste Cunningham, a Congresswoman and romantic interest of Jack's. She appeared in [...] "Secrets and Lies", where James Carville helps the fledgling relationship. The pair breaks up in Episode 210, when they realize their careers prevent them from staying together. Falco said that she was [...] "thrilled for the opportunity to work with such great comic actors", and expressed her enjoyment of watching the series. Fey was [...] "thrilled to have such an amazing actress come join us", and joked that [...] "a lot of guys on our crew want The Sopranos ending explained to them", in which Falco was a series star.|$|E
500|$|On Behind the Bin, a making-of {{documentary}} about Dustbin Baby, Wilson said that [...] "lots {{and lots of}} people will identify with" [...] the central theme of adoption, as at fourteen [...] "you start to look at your mum and dad and think 'I'm nothing like them', and everyone seems to have fantasies about that they were adopted or something, and so I think that it's a typical teenage thing that you question who you are". Richards says that <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> idea that April [...] "went on a journey to try and find herself" [...] as [...] "a lot of people [...] try and do that {{because a lot of people}} get to the point where they're not really sure who they are any more". Richards also discusses the motif of April's paper dolls, saying that April can relate to them as in different places, she is [...] "still the same person", but that she is [...] "coloured in differently by different people and different surroundings". Alexandra Hewett, who played the Young April, described the dolls as April's [...] "only real friends".|$|E
6000|$|She {{became a}} {{familiar}} figure in the cattle-market, sitting waiting in the little booth. But <b>she</b> <b>liked</b> best to go to Derby. There her father had more friends.

The landlord was Brangwen's old friend, and Anna was made much of. She sat many a day in the cosy parlour talking to Mr. Wigginton, a fat man with red hair, the landlord.

500|$|A low-budget {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Lollipop (Param Pam Pam)" [...] was posted onto Maan Studio's YouTube channel on 22 December 2009 and filmed by Andrei Nemirschi in a restaurant. The whole clip portrays Stan and two fellow female dancers performing {{in front of}} a purple backdrop. It commences with Stan asking herself which sweets <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> most, with the words [...] "candy", [...] "chocolate" [...] and [...] "ice cream" [...] appearing on the screen. Following this, the other females are presented wearing white underwear until one of them is shown with a saxophone. Next, Stan is shown blowing a bubble with bubble gum and, after she further dances to the song, the clip ends with the screen displaying the phrase [...] "param pam pam" [...] and finally becoming dark. Scenes interspersed through the main video portrayed Stan seductively licking a lollipop. The clip was not received well by the audience. Spanish-language [...] music station Los 40 Principales named the video for [...] "Lollipop (Param Pam Pam)" [...] as one of Stan's best clips ever.|$|E

The two bicker all evening and sabotage each other's attempts to chat up people in the bar. Penny admits that <b>she</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> new, more assertive Leonard.
