500|$|Barbette's {{mother took}} him to the circus at an early age in Austin and he was fascinated by the wire act. [...] "The first time <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> to the circus in Austin, I knew I would be a performer, and from then on I'd work in the fields during the cotton-picking season to earn money in order to go to the circus as often as possible." [...] Barbette practiced for hours by walking along his mother's steel clothes line. He {{graduated}} from high school at the age of 14.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} surviving Christian depiction is a fresco of the 4th {{century in}} the Catacomb of Via Latina, Rome. [...] Four figures are on the bank, with Moses still in the water; the largest is the princess, who stretches out her arms, which the baby also does. [...] This gesture may derive from a textual variation found in Midrashic sources and the Aramaic translation of the Bible. In these [...] "she ... sent her female slave" [...] is changed to [...] "she stretched out her arm". [...] Though the context is Christian, many of the images here are of Old Testament subjects, and very likely reflect models adopted from an initially Jewish visual tradition, perhaps painted by artisans with sets of models for all religious requirements. [...] In the play Exagōgē by Ezekiel the Tragedian (3rd century BC), Moses recounts his finding, saying of the princess [...] "And straightway seeing me, <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> up", which may be reflected both in the New Testament Acts 7:20, and in artistic depictions where the princess is apparently first to grasp the ark.|$|E
2500|$|Radner {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan, to Jewish parents, Henrietta (née Dworkin), a legal secretary, and Herman Radner, a {{business}}man. Through her mother, Radner was a second cousin of business executive Steve Ballmer. She grew up in Detroit with a nanny, Elizabeth Clementine Gillies, whom she called [...] "Dibby" [...] (and on whom she based her famous character Emily Litella), and an older brother named Michael. She attended the exclusive University Liggett School in Detroit (it began its relocation to Grosse Pointe later that year). Toward {{the end of her}} life, Radner wrote in her autobiography, It's Always Something, that during her childhood and young adulthood, she battled numerous eating disorders: [...] "I coped with stress by having every possible eating disorder from the time I was nine years old. I have weighed as much as 160 pounds and as little as 93. When I was a kid, I overate constantly. My weight distressed my mother and <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> to a doctor who put me on Dexedrine diet pills when I was ten years old." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Old Chiltern {{is such a}} d---- cantankerous fellow, {{and perhaps}} Lady C. may say that I oughtn't to have taken {{advantage}} of her absence. But, what's the odds? If <b>she</b> <b>takes</b> <b>me</b> there'll be an end of it. If she don't, they can't eat me." ...|$|R
2500|$|... “Although she {{was well}} over forty, she had lost none of her high spirits; she was kind and affectionate, but her {{eccentric}} and despotic nature made her rather formidable. When she heard that I {{was going to marry}} her niece, <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> in hand. From that day my life was no longer my own. She was an early riser and she used to telephone me at eight in the morning. Sometimes she came to the Hotel du Rhin, where I was staying, and sat reading the papers in my room while I dressed. If I happened to be out, she sent her servants all over Paris to look for me and sometimes took part in the search herself. I never had a moment's peace. I had to lunch, dine, go to the theater and supper with her almost every day. She usually slept through the first act of a play, and then woke up with a start to declare that the performance was stupid and that she wished to go somewhere else. We often changed theaters two or three times in one evening. As she felt the cold, she made her footman sit on a chair at the door of her box, holding a small traveling bag filled with shawls, scarves and furs. All these objects were numbered. If by chance, she was awake and felt a draft, she would ask me to bring her such or such a number. I could have put up with all this but unfortunately she had a passion for dancing. At midnight, now wide awake, she would drag me to a night club where she danced till dawn.”The diplomat Maurice Paléologue wrote on 14 October 1913, [...] "Although she is fifty-three, she lives openly with an Argentinian blackguard, dances at Magic City with all comers till two in the morning and associates with the scum of the aerodromes." ...|$|E

6000|$|The sombre {{look in his}} face, which resembled that of a dreaming leopard, {{was due to the}} new {{and secret}} plans with which his mind was now engaged.

[...] "She despises me in it, and so does the mother, and so I reckon 'tis up to me to clean house." ...|$|R
6000|$|Brief as my absence had been, Mrs. Mackenzie {{had taken}} {{advantage}} of that moment again to outrage Clive and his father, and to announce that Rosa might go to see this Miss Newcome, whom people respected because she was rich, but whom she would never visit; no, never!

6000|$|... "Yes; I {{have been}} with her. Once <b>she</b> <b>took</b> <b>me</b> to your old home." [...] The color crept into Millicent's face. [...] "You don't seem to {{remember}} me, Lieutenant Blake." ...|$|E
