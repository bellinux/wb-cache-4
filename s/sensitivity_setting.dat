40|$|With the {{introduction}} of dual chamber pacemakers that have multiple atrial amplitude sensing values, selective P wave sensing is possible. Five consecutive patients were studied who had 1) retrograde atrioventricular conduction, 2) anterograde atrial signals that were at least 1. 4 times larger than their corresponding retrograde, atrial signals, and 3) dual chamber pulse generators {{that are capable of}} discriminating this difference in atrial amplitude. In each patient the pacemaker was programmed in the DDD mode and the posiventricular atrial refractory interval was at least 100 - ms shorter than the individual's minimal retrograde conduction time. Two atria! sensitivity settings were evaluated in each patient: a high setting to ensure sensing of both anterograde and retrograde P waves, and a lower setting to allow sensing of anterograde P waves only. Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring demonstrated that with a high <b>sensitivity</b> <b>setting,</b> each patient sustained endless loop tachycardia (mean number of episodes 41, range 6 to 143) and that a logy atria! <b>sensitivity</b> <b>setting</b> eliminated the tachycardia.

30|$|As visual {{impairment}} {{is common in}} elderly people, displaying road signs, speed limit data and traffic signs on the HUD (with optional audible cues) could improve elderly drivers’ road safety by enhancing the clarity of road/traffic signs [40]. In addition, elderly drivers, who need an early warning, due to a slower reaction time than younger drivers, will {{have the chance to}} decide when they want such information to be made available on the HUD. This will give them enough time (usually longer than for younger drivers) to perform the manoeuvres, before they are able to see the actual sign. This is probably a more effective alternative to ‘making road signs bigger to help elderly drivers’, as suggested by Box et al. [56]. Moreover, integrating the HUD into IVS has the potential to allow the driver to remain focused on the environment outside the vehicle while maintaining the situational awareness {{of the relationship between the}} vehicle and the external objects by offering the driver advice along with a bird’s eye view of what is around the vehicle and the distances from them.

40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{automated}} {{measurement of the}} hysteresis of the temperature-compensated inductance-to-frequency converter with a single quartz crystal is proposed. The new idea behind this method is a converter with two programmable analog switches enabling the automated measurement of the converter hysteresis, {{as well as the}} temperature compensation of the quartz crystal and any other circuit element. Also used is the programmable timing control device that allows the selection of different oscillating frequencies. In the proposed programmable method two different inductances connected in series to the quartz crystal are switched in a short time sequence, compensating the crystal’s natural temperature characteristics (in the temperature range between 0 and 50 °C). The procedure allows for the measurement of the converter hysteresis at various values of capacitance connected in parallel with the quartz crystal for the converter <b>sensitivity</b> <b>setting</b> at selected inductance. It, furthermore, enables the measurement of hysteresis at various values of inductance at selected parallel capacitance (sensitivity) connected to the quartz crystal. The article shows that the proposed hysteresis measurement of the converter, which converts the inductance in the range between 95 and 100 μH to a frequency in the range between 1 and 200 kHz, has only 7 × 10 − 13 frequency instability (during the temperature change between 0 and 50 °C) with a maximum 1 × 10 − 11 hysteresis frequency difference...|$|E
40|$|The {{continued}} {{efficacy of}} dual chamber pacing {{is predicated on}} the stability of both atrial and ventricular electrodes. The introduction of the tined atrial J lead has decreased the incidence of atrial lead dislodgment, allowing for continued effective sensing and pacing. To study the evolution of atrial pacing and sensing threshold, 54 patients with identical pulse generators and atrial electrodes were evaluated for 58 ± 29 weeks (mean ± SD). Immediately after pacemaker implantation in 39 patients, the amplitude of the atrial signal was measured by programming the pulse generator to the lowest sensitivity that assured pacing in the atrial synchronous mode. Three levels of atrial sensing were possible: high (0. 5 mV), intermediate (1. 3 mV) and low (2. 5 mV) sensitivity. Three patients had a high, 16 patients had a medium and 20 patients had a low atrial sensitivity. The P wave amplitude and slew rate measured on a physiologic recorder {{did not differ significantly}} between the latter two groups. The atrial charge threshold increased from 1. 8 ± 1. 3 microcoulombs (±C) to a maximal value of 2. 5 ± 1. 3 µC, 3 days to 1 week after implantation (p = 0. 02). This remained elevated for 1 to 3 months (p = 0. 05) and then decreased, remaining stable over the ensuing year. The atrial sensitivity for the group with noninvasive measurement did not change significantly, although there was considerable patient variation. For 54 % of the patients, atrial sensing remained stable or improved. In 26 % of the patients, further programming to higher sensitivity settings was required. In the remaining 20 % of the patients, the atrial <b>sensitivity</b> <b>setting</b> fluctuated. The atrial charge threshold increases in the early postoperative period and remains elevated for months. The atrial sensing threshold does not follow a predictable time course. Although there is little variation in the mean size of the atrial electrogram, atrial sensing must be continuously monitored to compensate for individual fluctuation in the stability of the atrial signal...|$|E
