25|$|Cullinan had a {{profound}} impact upon the city of Houston. In addition to being one of the key supporters {{for the development of the}} Houston Ship Channel, he also built the North <b>Side</b> <b>belt</b> railway. He supported venues such as the Houston Symphony Orchestra as well as the Museum of Fine Arts (Houston). He served as president of the Houston Chamber of Commerce from 1913 until 1919. During World War I, he served under Herbert Hoover as a special advisor to the Food Administration. For five years starting in 1928 he served on the Mount Rushmore National Memorial Committee. On March 11, 1937, Cullinan died during his visitation with Hoover in Palo Alto, California where he was overcome with pneumonia. Afterward his interest in TEXACO was split six ways between his sister Mary Nicholson and his children.|$|E

500|$|Two of the 454kg bombs hit {{amidships}} {{between the}} 15cm and 10.5cm gun turrets; both failed to explode and penetrated the ship completely. The first went through each deck and exited the ship through the double bottom, {{while the other}} was deflected by the torpedo bulkhead and penetrated the hull beneath the <b>side</b> <b>belt</b> armor. The third 454kg bomb hit aft of the rear 28cm turret, about [...] {{from the side of}} the ship. It too failed to detonate, and passed through the side of the hull, which was not protected by the main armor belt. These three hits caused significant flooding and caused an 8degree list to starboard. The forward and rear gun turrets were temporarily disabled, along with half of her anti-aircraft battery. Two men were killed and fifteen were injured in the attack. Damage control teams managed to correct the list with counter-flooding, and although draft increased by , Scharnhorst was able to leave for Brest at 19:30. On the morning of 25 July, one of the escorting destroyers shot down a British patrol plane. The ship reached Brest later that day and went into dry dock for repairs. While the damage was being repaired, a new radar system was installed aft, the power output for the forward radar was increased to 100kW, and the 53.3cm torpedo tubes were installed.|$|E

2500|$|Armour at {{the flight}} deck level would protect the hangar deck and the {{aircraft}} stored there from most bombs. The armour of the Illustrious class was intended to protect against 1,000 pound bombs. In the Illustrious class, the armoured flight deck extended for {{about two-thirds of the}} length of the ship, bounded by the two aircraft lifts (which were without the armour). The deck was closed by [...] armoured sides and bulkheads, forming an armoured box. The bulkheads had sliding armoured portals to allow access between the hangar and the aircraft lift. There were [...] lateral strakes of main deck armour that extended {{from the base of the}} hangar side-wall to the top of the main <b>side</b> <b>belt.</b> The latter protected the machinery, magazines and aircraft fuel and weaponry stores. The RN's closed and armoured hangars were capable of being environmentally sealed for protection against chemical weapon attack. The armoured design meant that it would have to be attacked with Armour Piercing (AP) bombs, which have much less blast effect than higher-capacity General Purpose (GP) bombs carrying about twice the explosive amount. GP bombs also caused severe hull damage if they exploded in the water close to the hull; AP bombs, much less so.|$|E
