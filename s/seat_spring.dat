40|$|Risk-based {{inspection}} methods enable {{estimation of}} the probability of failure on demand for spring-operated pressure relief valves at the United States Department of Energy&#x 27;s Savannah River Site in Aiken, South Carolina. This paper presents a statistical performance evaluation of soft <b>seat</b> <b>spring</b> operated pressure relief valves. These pressure relief valves are typically smaller and of lower cost than hard seat (metal to metal) pressure relief valves and can provide substantial cost savings in fluid service applications (air, gas, liquid, and steam) providing that probability of failure on demand (the probability that the pressure relief valve fails to perform its intended safety function during a potentially dangerous over pressurization) {{is at least as}} good as that for hard seat valves. The research in this paper shows that the proportion of soft <b>seat</b> <b>spring</b> operated pressure relief valves failing is the same or less than that of hard seat valves, and that for failed valves, soft seat valves typically have failure ratios of proof test pressure to set pressure less than that of hard seat valves...|$|E

The front brake was installed in the hub. The rear suspension also had telescopic oil-filled shock absorbers. The gasoline flowed down through flexible hoses. A panel in the frame allowed {{easy access to the}} <b>seat</b> <b>springs</b> to adjust the hardness of the seat’s suspension.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, rubber washers {{have been}} used at the seating {{arrangement}} of the primary springs of the axle box housing in the ICF design passenger coaches on the Indian Railways. The rubber washer is used directly on the axle box seating area. the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> sits on the washers. The lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> is a tubular structure and 3/4 section is partitioned by using a circular ring which is welded at the 3/4 section. On the top of <b>spring</b> <b>seat,</b> a polymer ring called NFTC ring sits. The primary spring sits on the NFTC ring. The lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> {{plays the role of}} a cylinder in the dashpot arrangement and is filled with oil. In the dashpot arrangement, the top portion is called the axle box guide. The axle box guide is welded to the bogie frame. The axle box guide works as a piston in the Lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> filled with oil. This helps in damping the vibrations caused during running train operation.|$|R

50|$|The primary {{suspension}} in an ICF Bogie {{is through a}} dashpot arrangement. The dashpot arrangement consists of a cylinder (lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat)</b> and the piston (axle box guide). Axle box springs are placed on the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> placed on the axle box wing of the axle box housing assembly. A rubber or a Hytrel washer is placed below the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> for cushioning effect. The axle box guide is welded to the bogie frame. The axle box guide acts as a piston. A homopolymer acetyle washer {{is placed on the}} lower end of the axle box guide. The end portion of the axle box guide is covered with a guide cap, which has holes in it. A sealing ring is placed near the washer and performs the function of a piston ring. The axle box guide moves in the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> filled with dashpot oil. This arrangement provides the dampening effect during the running of the coach.|$|R
5000|$|The Chopper's patent {{was applied}} for in the US in 1967. The Chopper was {{introduced}} at American trade shows in January 1969 {{but it was not}} until April 1969 when Raleigh Choppers were available for public to purchase. The bike featured a choice of a single-speed coaster hub, or a 3-speed or 5-speed Sturmey Archer gear hub, selected using a frame-mounted console gear lever — one of its [...] "cool" [...] features. Other features that appealed to the youth market were the unusual frame, long padded high-back <b>seat,</b> <b>sprung</b> <b>seat</b> at the back, high-rise (ape hanger) handlebars, 'bobbed' mudguards (fenders) and differently sized wheels — 16 in front and 20 in rear. The rear hoop above the seat resembled a dragster anti roll bar [...] "sissy bar". Even the kickstand was designed to give the stationary bicycle a lean reminiscent of a parked motorcycle. Tyres were wider than usual for the time, with a chunky tread on the rear wheel, featuring a red line around the sidewall.|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} erotic theatres in the U.S. were in California, {{and showed}} 35-millimetre low-production-quality independently produced films. In 1960 there existed about twenty theatres in the U.S. that showed erotic movies exclusively. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, they {{spread to the}} rest of the country. Small [...] "storefront" [...] theatres with only a few dozen <b>seats</b> <b>sprang</b> up, and by 1970, 750 pornographic theatres existed in the U.S. In the 1970s, theatres shifted from showing 35-millimetre sexploitation films to more explicit 16-millimetre [...] "beaver" [...] films. In the 1980s, some theatre owners began forming chains to cut their costs, and, by 1989, the number of U.S erotic theatres had fallen below 250.|$|R

40|$|A shaker with a Terfenol-D rod {{actuator}} {{includes a}} mass coupled to {{both ends of}} the rod through a <b>spring</b> <b>seat,</b> a <b>spring</b> seat/adjuster and a spring washer. The actuator is mounted inside a cylindrical coil, which in turn is mounted inside a cylindrical permanent magnet, which in turn is mounted inside a cylindrical housing. An electrical drive system provides a predetermined excitation signal to the coil to cause the rod to vibrate {{under the influence of the}} magnetic field generated by the coil. One embodiment features a vibrating mass on one end of the rod. An implantable shaker includes a seal to leak-proof the shaker and a coating of Biomer™. The implantable shaker can be implanted in an animal to test tissue response to certain vibrations. According to another embodiment, the Terfenol-D rod actuator is held in place on one end with a pre-stress adjusting screw, which is threaded into the end of the housing and fixed in place with a jam nut. In all embodiments, a <b>spring</b> base is <b>seated</b> on one end of the rod actuator and forms an annular coaxial air gap between it and a <b>spring</b> <b>seat,</b> so that the air gap remains constant when the rod actuator vibrates and the spring base moves coaxially with respect to the <b>spring</b> <b>seat...</b>|$|R

25|$|Saddles also {{vary with}} rider preference, from the {{cushioned}} ones favored by short-distance riders to narrower saddles which allow {{more room for}} leg swings. Comfort depends on riding position. With comfort bikes and hybrids, cyclists sit high over the seat, their weight directed down onto the saddle, such that a wider and more cushioned saddle is preferable. For racing bikes where the rider is bent over, weight is more evenly distributed between the handlebars and saddle, the hips are flexed, and a narrower and harder saddle is more efficient. Differing saddle designs exist {{for male and female}} cyclists, accommodating the genders' differing anatomies and sit bone width measurements, although bikes typically are sold with saddles most appropriate for men. Suspension seat posts and <b>seat</b> <b>springs</b> provide comfort by absorbing shock but can add to the overall weight of the bicycle.|$|R

50|$|Within 6 {{months of}} {{provision}} of Hytrel washers {{on all the}} main line coaches, the failure of Axle box housing increased. The reason was the axle box wing cracks. Hence on examination of the failed axle boxes, it was noticed that the Hytrel washers were forming a deep groove of 4 to 8mm on the seating area of the axle box <b>spring</b> <b>seating.</b> They washers were also increasing {{the diameter of the}} <b>spring</b> <b>seating</b> due to continuous hitting of the raised section of the sitting area.|$|R
50|$|The {{cylinder}} piston {{arrangement of the}} dashpot, i.e. the Lower <b>Spring</b> <b>seat</b> and the axle box guide is not fully sealed due to the limitation of the design and practical applicability. Its design provides that when a vertical vibration occurs during {{the movement of the}} railway coach, the axle box guide moves down. The downward movement of the Axle box guide puts pressure on the oil in the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat.</b> The oil rushes up. However, since there are holes in the guide cap, the oil passes through these holes into the hollow body of the axle box guide. This helps in dampening the vertical vibrations. The axle box guide displaces the oil in the lower <b>spring</b> <b>seat</b> and pushes it upwards. Since, only part quantity of oil is able to move up in the hollow portion of the axle box guide, the balance displaced oil moves up.|$|R

50|$|Little Falls, {{the county}} <b>seat,</b> <b>sprung</b> up when a second dam {{was built by}} the Little Falls Company (later called the Little Falls Manufacturing Company). This dam washed out, as the first had done, and Little Falls entered {{a long period of}} {{economic}} depression and stagnation as far as population growth. Bit by bit, Little Falls grew, until it was officially incorporated as a village in 1879. Another wave of immigration occurred between 1880 and 1920. A wide variety of ethnic groups chose Morrison County for their new home. This wave of immigration was spurred by the construction of the third dam at Little Falls in 1887. A group of investors from Louisville, Kentucky, led by M. M. Williams, provided the financing for this dam. They wanted to be sure their investment was successful. To this end, they worked to encourage other major industries to locate in the city, touting the water power as a prime feature.|$|R
