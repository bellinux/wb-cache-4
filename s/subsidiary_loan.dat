40|$|A {{number of}} {{financial}} institutions have two separate <b>subsidiaries</b> that make <b>loans</b> of similar type but differing risk. Common examples include bank holding companies that have both commercial bank and finance company subsidiaries, and “good bank/bad bank ” structures where the holding company retains ownership of both banks. Although one of the <b>subsidiaries</b> holds riskier <b>loans</b> than the other, such loan risk is difficult for outside investors to observe or verify ex ante. This {{raises the question of}} why these two activities are separately funded rather than being treated as separate divisions of a single corporation. We motivate the use of such “bipartite ” structures by appealing to the role of banks and similar institutions as delegated monitors. Because such institutions rely heavily on debt finance and have great flexibility in their choice and monitoring of loans, they may be tempted to exploit debt holders by risk-shifting: i. e., making inefficient risky loans or forgoing costly loan monitoring. A bipartite structure in which one subsidiary is supposed to hold safer loans and the other is supposed to hold riskier loans “insulates ” safer loans from riskier loans, reducing risk-shifting incentives in the safer subsidiary. Although the risk...|$|R

40|$|Commercial {{banks in}} Malaysia and Singapore have played an {{important}} role in the tremendous economic development that has taken place in the region over recent years. In the light of these developments, the objective of this study is to identify the determinants of profitability of commercial banks in Malaysia and singapore. The determinats of profitability and theories thereof used in this study are those frequently described in conventional banking studies and literature. The data for the studies have been extracted from the annual reports of sixteen local commercial banks in Malaysia and ten local commercial banks in Singapore. The period under purview covers financial statements for ten years from 1988 to 1997. The profitability determinants were basically divided into two main categories, namely the internal determinants and the external determinants. The internal determinants include management controllable factors such as liquidity, investment in securities, investment in <b>subsidiaries,</b> <b>loans,</b> non-performing loans, and overhead expenditure. Other determinants such as savings, current account deposits, fixed deposits, total capital and capital reserves, and money supply also play a major role in influencing the profitability. Similarly, external determinants includes those factors which are beyond the control of management of these institutions such as interest rates, inflation rates, market growth and market share. In order to incorporate the internal and external determinants into a single profitability model, it was necessary to include dummy variables to take account of inter-firm and inter temporal differences in the intercept. Thus, pooled regression analysis was applied to a linear model to analyse the profitabilty determinants of Malaysian and Singaporean commercial banks. Briefly the findings indicated that local commercial banks should focus their attention on strategies such as good mangement, a conservative lending policy, a well managed investment portfolio with good liquidity, productivity management, an outstanding of securities portfolio management and tight control over operating expenses to increase profitability. Several promising areas for future research are identified in this study such as interest rate spread or margin can be used as an exploratory variable in place of just market interest rates. Secondly, the variables loans portfolio may be used for bank management in structuring a sound, stable and profitable portfolio.

40|$|Foreign {{banks have}} greatly {{increased}} {{their presence in}} emerging market countries in recent years. This paper compares the performance of domestic banks and a long-established group of foreign banks during the recent crisis in Malaysia. We find that the sharpest differences are between banks mainly active in Asia (including all domestic and some foreign banks) and foreign banks not specialized in Asia. The latter group performed better than the rest during the crisis, maintaining higher profitability thanks to higher interest margins and lower nonperforming loans. Foreign banks did not abandon the local market during the crisis and received less government support than domestic institutions.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between the role of trade finance availability and the export intensity of foreign subsidiaries of multinational enterprises (MNEs). In developing our hypotheses, we draw upon insights derived from “new” internalisation theory (international business literature) and international trade finance (international economics literature). We empirically test these hypotheses using survey data compiled from subsidiary managers in six ASEAN countries, supplemented with host-country level data. We conceptualise, empirically test, and establish that the subsidiary-level capability in combining and utilising internal and external debts is an important subsidiary-specific advantage to support export intensity. We find that <b>subsidiaries</b> employ intra-firm <b>loans</b> from MNE internal capital markets and, to some extent, bank loans from external financial institutions to boost their export intensity. Subsidiaries may have concerns about foreign exchange risks, but the use of appropriate foreign exchange risk management is positively associated with export intensity.

40|$|A growing {{literature}} {{investigates the}} role of internal capital markets in mitigating financial constraints faced by the subsidiaries of a conglomerate. Most studies have relied on indirect tests based on correlations between the cash flows and the investment of the subsidiaries. In contrast, we avoid the widespread criticisms of such specifications by providing direct tests {{that focus on the}} mechanisms through which internal reallocations of funds occur. We find that internal capital markets are used by multibank holding companies to mitigate capital constraints faced by individual bank subsidiaries. In addition, we show that internal capital management within a multibank holding company involves not only the movement of capital to those subsidiaries with a relatively greater need for capital but also the movement of assets (loans) from less well capitalized to better capitalized subsidiaries by means of loan sales and purchases among the <b>subsidiaries.</b> Furthermore, net <b>loan</b> sales are used to allow efficiency-enhancing specialization among bank subsidiaries, insofar as those subsidiaries with the best loan origination opportunities are able to focus on loan originations even if they do not have sufficient capital to hold the loans. Our evidence is consistent with banks affiliated with holding companies more actively participating in loan sales and purchases because, by using their internal secondary loan market, they are able to avoid the "lemons" problem faced by stand-alone banks.

40|$|An Intermediary Holding Company (“IHC”) is {{a company}} that is {{interposed}} between an ultimate holding company and the operating subsidiaries of a group of companies. The IHC operates at an international level such that either its holding company or its subsidiaries or both are located in a country foreign to the IHC. Its main functions are to acquire, manage and dispose of the assets of the group of companies and to facilitate structural flexibility of a group of companies. Investors have tax and non-tax reasons for conducting business using an IHC, and, depending on the reasons, they determine the location of the IHC based on the characteristics of potential host countries. This thesis analyses the suitability of the South African corporate tax regime for the use of South African-resident Intermediary Holding Companies. The South African government has the objective of promoting South Africa as a gateway for investment in Africa and for this reason the present research is important. Such an objective could be adversely affected by a corporate tax regime that is not suitable for the operations of an IHC. Furthermore, the Katz Commission recommended in 1997 that South Africa should consider introducing a regime that is suitable for the location of holding companies. In discharging its functions the IHC attracts liability for corporate income tax, capital gains tax, controlled foreign company tax and dividends tax. It also exposes itself to anti-avoidance measures such as thin capitalisation and transfer pricing provisions. The existence of such taxes and anti-avoidance measures in the tax system of a country may deter investors from locating an IHC in such country. Exchange control regulations could also adversely affect the ability of the IHC to perform its functions effectively, as their purpose is to restrict the movement of capital out of the country. The South African legal system contains all these taxes and anti-avoidance measures as well as exchange control provisions. However, it also contains tax instruments that alleviate the tax burden on an investor using an IHC such as the participation exemption, advance tax rulings and a network of tax treaties. Against this background this thesis analyses the South African corporate tax system to determine whether it is suitable for locating an IHC. In the analysis, a comparative study is done of the tax systems of two of the most effective IHC host countries, namely the Netherlands and Mauritius. In addition, a brief discussion of the special features contained in the tax systems of Belgium, Ireland and the United Kingdom outlines why these jurisdictions are not necessarily successful in attracting IHCs. The thesis also discusses harmful tax practices and the attitude of the international community towards countries that engage in harmful tax competition {{in order to determine the}} limits to which a country should use the tax system to attract investment. Finally, the thesis makes recommendations as to what adjustments could be made in order to enhance the suitability of South Africa to host an IHC. The thesis recommends a special dispensation as regards corporate income tax and exchange control that would apply to wholly-owned South African companies that own foreign <b>subsidiary</b> shares and <b>loans</b> that consist of 80 % of the gross asset total of these companies.
