2500|$|When Mr Gladstone {{visited the}} North, you well {{remember}} when word {{passed from the}} newspaper to the workman that it circulated through mines and mills, factories and workshops, and they came out to greet the only British minister who ever gave the English people a right {{because it was just}} they <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> ... and when he went down the Tyne, all the country heard how twenty miles of banks were lined with people who came to greet him. Men stood in the blaze of chimneys; the roofs of factories were crowded; colliers came up from the mines; women held up their children on the banks that it might be said in after life that they had seen the Chancellor of the People go by. The river was covered like the land. Every man who could ply an oar pulled up to give Mr Gladstone a cheer. When Lord Palmerston went to Bradford the streets were still, and working men imposed silence upon themselves. When Mr Gladstone appeared on the Tyne he heard cheer no other English minister ever heard ... the people were grateful to him, and rough pitmen who never approached a public man before, pressed round his carriage by thousands ... and thousands of arms were stretched out at once, to shake hands with Mr Gladstone as one of themselves.|$|E
2500|$|Historia Anglorum. British Library, Royal MS 14 C VII, fols. 8v–156v. 358 x 250mm, ff 232 in all. A {{history of}} England, begun in 1250 and perhaps {{completed}} around 1255, covering the years 1070–1253. [...] The text is an abridgement of the Chronica, also drawing on Wendover's Flores Historiarum and Paris' earlier edited {{version of the}} Chronica. [...] Bound with it is the final part of Paris' Chronica Majora, covering the years 1254–1259 (folios 157–218), and prefatory material including an itinerary from London to Jerusalem and tinted drawings of the kings of England. All is in Paris' own hand, apart from folios 210–218 and 154v-156v, which are in a hand of the scribe who has added a note of Matthew Paris' death (f. 218v). [...] The Chronica concludes with a portrait of Paris on his death-bed, presumably not by him. By the 15th century this volume belonged to Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, son of Henry IV, who inscribed it [...] "Ceste livre est a moy Homffrey Duc de Gloucestre". [...] Later it was held by the bishop of Lincoln, who wrote a note that if the monks of St Albans could prove the book was a loan, they <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>it</b> back. [...] Otherwise it was bequeathed to New College, Oxford. [...] The fact that the book was acquired by a 16th-century Earl of Arundel suggests that Duke Humphrey's inscription was not entirely accurate, as New College would probably not have disposed of it.|$|E
