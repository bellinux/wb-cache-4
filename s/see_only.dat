5|$|Cycling is an {{increasingly}} popular {{way to get}} around London. The launch of a cycle hire scheme in July 2010 has been successful and generally well received. The London Cycling Campaign lobbies for better provision. But in the central parts (The City & City of Westminster) are common cyclists a rare thing to <b>see.</b> <b>Only</b> messenger with helmets and sport bikes are seen there. There is a general lack of bike roads. Further out from the city centre is however lots of bikes parked around tube stations and other.|$|E
5|$|Imprisoned debtors {{were allowed}} some social contact, but the regime for criminals was {{designed}} to be one of isolation, according to the separate system. Consequently, the seating in the prison chapel is designed to enclose each prisoner individually so that the preacher could see everyone but each could <b>see</b> <b>only</b> him. By 1878 the system was discredited and the inmates were transferred to the new gaol in the eastern outskirts of Lincoln. The prison in the castle was left without a use until the Lincolnshire Archives were housed in its cells.|$|E
5|$|The narrator, Charles, {{lives with}} his friend Juste in a large boarding-house {{populated}} almost entirely with students like themselves (Charles is studying law and Juste medicine). The sole exception is their middle-aged neighbor, Z. Marcas, of whom they <b>see</b> <b>only</b> momentary glimpses in the hall. They learn {{that he is a}} copyist, and living on an extremely small salary. When the students find themselves lacking the funds for tobacco, Marcas offers them some of his own. They become friends, and he tells them the story of his political career.|$|E

5|$|The {{manipulation}} {{of time at}} higher latitudes (for example Iceland, Nunavut or Alaska) has little impact on daily life, because the length of day and night changes more extremely throughout the seasons (in comparison to other latitudes), and thus sunrise and sunset times are significantly out of phase with standard working hours regardless of manipulations of the clock. DST is also of little use for locations near the equator, because these regions <b>see</b> <b>only</b> a small variation in daylight {{in the course of}} the year. The effect also varies according to how far east or west the location is within its time zone, with locations farther east inside the time zone benefiting more from DST than locations farther west in the same time zone.|$|E
5|$|Transmissions {{took place}} {{from a single}} {{arrowhead}} antenna mounted on {{the nose of the}} aircraft. This consisted of a folded dipole with a passive director in front of it, both bent rearward at about 35 degrees, projecting from the nosecone on a mounting rod. For vertical reception, the receiver antennas consisted of two half-wave unipoles mounted above and below the wing, with a reflector behind them. The wing acted as a signal barrier, allowing the antennas to <b>see</b> <b>only</b> the portion of the sky above or below the wing as well as directly in front. These antennas were angled rearward at the same angle as the transmitter. The horizontal receivers and directors were mounted on rods projecting from {{the leading edge of the}} wing, the antennas aligned vertically. The fuselage and engine nacelles formed the barriers for these antennas.|$|E

The Holy See also recognizes the State of Palestine, the only other non-UN member it recognizes besides Taiwan.|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{construction}} of identity {{is such a}} complex layer rooted with so many implications, and I believe that my attempt with that piece was to open the conversation to that by saying that identity could be a tragedy. If I let myself be <b>seen</b> <b>only</b> as a Cuban, that is a trap. If I let myself be <b>seen</b> <b>only</b> as woman, that is a trap. If I let myself be <b>seen</b> <b>only</b> as black, that is a trap. If I let myself be <b>seen</b> <b>only</b> as woman with Chinese ancestry, that is a trap. So, I wanted to open the conversation to the {{construction of}} identity, and especially within the history of Cuba. Cuba is such a place of encounters, no? Of merging ideas, merging of ethnicities, merging of traditions.... What I was trying to say is this is who I am".|$|R

25|$|Attitudinal barriers: {{are created}} by people who <b>see</b> <b>only</b> {{disability}} when associating with people with disabilities in some way. These attitudinal barriers can be witnessed through bullying, discrimination, and fear. These barriers include low expectations of people with disabilities. These barriers contribute to all other barriers. Attitudes towards people with disabilities in low and middle-income countries can be even more extreme.|$|E
25|$|Empedocles {{noted the}} {{limitation}} and narrowness of human perceptions. We <b>see</b> <b>only</b> a part but fancy {{that we have}} grasped the whole. But the senses cannot lead to truth; thought and reflection must look at the thing from every side. It is the business of a philosopher, while laying bare the fundamental difference of elements, to show the identity that exists between what seem unconnected parts of the universe.|$|E
25|$|Architect Arthur Cotton Moore {{said that}} massed, block-long {{building}} lines were necessary {{due to the}} need to use as much space as possible. To break up the monolithic, wall-like effect of this massing, each long facade was broken in multiple smaller facades and different architectural styles used to make the buildings visually interesting. Moore said he designed the walkways so that pedestrians <b>see</b> <b>only</b> one facade at a time, so consistency in architectural vision is maintained.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, a labiaplasty surgeon {{can earn}} up to $250,000 a month. Simone Weil Davis, {{professor}} of American studies, told Shameless magazine in 2005 that surgeons are perpetuating {{the idea that}} there is a right way for women's genitalia to look; because most women <b>see</b> <b>only</b> their own vaginas or pornographic images, it is easy to make them doubt themselves. The feminist organization, the New View Campaign, has spoken out against the existence of unregulated cosmetic surgery clinics as business enterprises, which it says trade on women's sexuality by appealing to their low self-esteem, thereby creating health risks.|$|E
25|$|The FBI in {{the past}} has {{identified}} individuals by the sequence number in which each individual has appeared on the list. Some individuals have even appeared twice, and often a sequence number was permanently assigned to an individual suspect who was soon caught, captured, or simply removed, before his or her appearance could be published on the publicly released list. In those cases, the public would <b>see</b> <b>only</b> gaps in the number sequence reported by the FBI. For convenient reference, the wanted suspect's sequence number and date of entry on the FBI list appear below, whenever possible.|$|E
25|$|A {{projection}} system with two CRTs {{was better than}} three, but still not practical for a home receiver. Baird continued to consider other solutions. One used a single conventional CRT with the two images displayed in a single frame, with {{the top half of}} the image containing the image for one color and the bottom the other. Lens systems focused on the display were positioned to <b>see</b> <b>only</b> the top or bottom image, passed them through filters, and then recombined them on a screen. There were drawings showing a similar system with three frames. Like many similar efforts from other experimenters, Baird abandoned this approach.|$|E

25|$|Today {{tourists}} <b>see</b> <b>only</b> the sculpted figurines of this clock, {{but behind}} this ensemble {{there is a}} mechanism that engages and that {{represents one of the}} most beautiful curiosities of the cathedral. The animated characters launch into movement at different hours of the day. One angel sounds the bell while a second turns over an hourglass. Different characters, representing the ages of life (from a child to an old man) parade in front of Death. On the last level are the Apostles, passing in front of Christ. The clock shows much more than the official time; it also indicates solar time, the day of the week (each represented by a god of mythology), the month, the year, the sign of the zodiac, the phase of the moon and the position of several planets. All these automatons are put into operation at 12:30 PM.|$|E
25|$|While the Pevensies {{are playing}} hide-and-seek, Lucy discovers a {{wardrobe}} and enters a wintry fantasy world called Narnia. Seeing a lamppost, Lucy encounters the faun Mr. Tumnus, who explains the land she has entered and invites {{her to his}} home. He puts Lucy to sleep by playing a lullaby on his flute. When Lucy wakes up, she finds Tumnus grieving, and he explains that Jadis, the White Witch, has cursed Narnia {{and it has been}} winter for 100 years. If a human is encountered they are to be brought to her. Tumnus cannot bring himself to kidnap Lucy, so he sends her home. When she returns to Professor Kirke's house, hardly any time has passed in the normal world; her siblings do not believe her story, and when they look in the wardrobe to <b>see</b> <b>only</b> a normal back.|$|E
25|$|First {{trying to}} examine the hole with a {{flashlight}} from above Gómez could <b>see</b> <b>only</b> darkness, so tied with a line of heavy rope around his waist he was lowered by several colleagues, and descending into the murk {{he realized it was}} a perfectly cylindrical shaft. At the bottom he came to rest in apparently ancient construction – a man-made tunnel, blocked in both directions by immense stones. Gómez was acquainted that archaeologists had previously discovered a narrow tunnel underneath the Pyramid of the Sun, and supposed he was now observing a kind of similar mirror tunnel, leading to a subterranean chamber beneath Temple of the Feathered Serpent. He decided initially to elaborate clear hypothesis and to obtain approval. Meanwhile, he erected a tent over the sinkhole to preserve it from {{the hundreds of thousands of}} tourists who visit Teotihuacán. Researchers reported that the tunnel was believed to have been sealed in 200 CE.|$|E
