I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [...] technique from airplanes...I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a <b>skid</b> <b>mark,</b> like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think." ...|$|E

5000|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, <b>skid</b> <b>marks</b> are {{not caused by}} pieces of rubber from the tire being {{deposited}} on the road because friction heats up the tire. <b>Skid</b> <b>marks</b> are actually bituminous oils in the asphalt that are heated because of the friction of breaking or accelerating and rise to the surface, leaving dark marks. This is why the marks fade. Within one hour, 3-4% of the mark has already faded.|$|R

The only thing left to convince him is the Trial of Combat, where Killjoy has to fight to the death with an opponent, which is <b>Skid</b> <b>Mark.</b> Batty Boop recognizes <b>Skid</b> <b>Mark</b> as one of her victims, who roofied her and raped her, leaving behind only one 'love bite' on him: an infection. <b>Skid</b> <b>Mark</b> turns into a monster, and claims whoever wins gets to keep Batty. An unnamed Clown Observer hands Killjoy a bag of tricks, compliments of Punchy and the clowns, which is ineffective. Batty tells Sandie if Killjoy loses, she won't {{be able to get out}} of Hell, so Sandie hands Killjoy his malice and crushes Skid Mark's head off. The Clowns revolt in the courtroom, where Batty kills Jezabeth and Punchy kills Bailiff. Beelzebub, in a fit of anger, incinerates everyone but Punchy, Freakshow, Sandie, Batty and Killjoy before disappearing. Killjoy opens the box, and presses a button, which will self-destruct Hell in a minute. The group escapes in the elevator up to Earth, where the clown posse pursue Sandie in the streets.|$|E

50|$|One {{aspect is}} the {{analysis}} of trace evidence such as <b>skid</b> <b>marks</b> on exposed surfaces, where contact between dissimilar materials leaves material traces of one left on the other.

50|$|Skid marks {{can also}} be formed where a ladder {{suddenly}} slips and the user falls to the ground, especially if the ladder feet are faulty or absent. Loss of the rubber feet or foot causes the aluminum stile {{to make contact with}} the ground, and if a hard surface like concrete or tiling, a <b>skid</b> <b>mark</b> shows how and why the ladder slipped. Unless fixed to the wall upon which they are leaning, ladders can slip down easily especially if leant at an angle lower than about 75 degrees. Such slip accidents tend to happen when the user is near the top, so increasing his or her chances of serious personal injury.|$|E
50|$|Scene {{inspections}} and data recovery involves visiting {{the scene of}} the accident and investigating all of the vehicles involved in the collision. Investigations involve collecting evidence such as scene photographs, video of the collision, measurements of the scene, eyewitness testimony, and legal depositions. Additional factors include steering angles, braking, use of lights, turn signals, speed, acceleration, engine rpm, cruise control, and anti-lock brakes. Witnesses are interviewed during accident reconstruction, and physical evidence such as tire marks are examined. The length of a <b>skid</b> <b>mark</b> can often allow calculation of the original speed of a vehicle for example. Vehicle speeds are frequently underestimated by a driver, so an independent estimate of speed is often essential in accidents. Inspection of the road surface is also vital, especially when traction has been lost due to black ice, diesel fuel contamination, or obstacles such as road debris. Data from an event data recorder also provides valuable information such as the speed of the vehicle a few seconds before the collision.|$|E
5000|$|The {{airport was}} the site of {{numerous}} accidents and mishaps, none of which were fatal. Many of the accidents were caused by the congested development around the airport.

On one landing attempt, a [...] "tail-dragger" [...] struck the object with its rear wheel and reportedly left a large black <b>skid</b> <b>mark</b> on the top of the screen.

40|$|Abstract. An {{expert system}} has been {{proposed}} to estimate {{the relationship between the}} vehicle pre-braking speed and the length of the <b>skid</b> <b>mark.</b> Since the length of the <b>skid</b> <b>mark</b> varies with many factors, there is no a single formula or equation which can represent the relationship between the vehicle pre-braking speed and the length of the <b>skid</b> <b>mark.</b> Therefore in this paper an expert system is built to estimate the relationship between the vehicle pre-braking speed and the length of the <b>skid</b> <b>mark.</b> The radial basis function (RBF) neural network is used for the expert system due to its shorter training time and higher accuracy. There are many factors affecting the <b>skid</b> <b>mark.</b> In this paper we choose 7 factors, i. e. brand of vehicle, vehicle displacement, year of manufacture, vehicle weight, vehicles with and without ABS, roadway surface, and vehicle speed for the training in the RBF neural network. The total number of the training data for the RBF neural network is 2619. The results showed that high accuracy is obtained for estimating the relationship between the vehicle pre-braking speed and the length of the <b>skid</b> <b>mark.</b> Thus the expert system proposed in this paper is demonstrated to be a suitable system for estimating the relationship between the vehicle pre-braking speed and the length of the <b>skid</b> <b>mark...</b>|$|E

For a critical case such as traffic accident reconstruction, however, the initial velocity of the car should be calculated precisely. In this study, in order to estimate the speed at the brake onset, rapid braking tests were executed on the proving ground. We compared with a skid length and wheel locking time of an expert driver and a general person. We verified that the <b>skid</b> <b>mark</b> of expert driver occurs longer than general person's. A new method is proposed to determine {{the speed of a}} vehicle at the brake onset of maximum braking, which could be applied to a reconstruction of vehicle with Non-ABS...|$|E
