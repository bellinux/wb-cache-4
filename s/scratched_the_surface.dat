He thought {{that the role of}} Lore was a chance for Spiner to showcase his abilities, but felt that the story only <b>scratched</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the possible routes that could have been taken. He thought the contraction issue was a problem, as despite saying that Data could not use them, he promptly used them throughout the episode including immediately after Lore was beamed off the ship which caused confusion as it [...] "punishes you for paying attention, because now you'll be half-convinced that the wrong robot was beamed away, and that Lore somehow won out in the end."

Bear had been writing a book {{entitled}} Hull Zero Three when he was approached to be the trilogy's author. At the first meeting with Bear regarding the book, he was told that it should be a [...] "classic Greg Bear giant – in the vein of Eon, Anvil of the Stars and so on", but inspired by Halo and its extended universe. The book and author were announced on April 6, 2009. 343 Industries' General Manager, Bonnie Ross, stated that the back and forth with Bear made [...] "the whole experience better", and was preferable to assigning the author his task with no feedback. Halo franchise development director Frank O'Connor stated, [...] "The enigma of the Forerunners is really at the heart of the drama and mystery of the Halo universe ... in all the games and the books so far we've only <b>scratched</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of the terrible events that engulfed the Forerunners and the Galaxy they protected 100,000 years ago". Although nothing was forced upon Bear in terms of story templates, he had numerous and comprehensive discussions about the history of the Halo universe and the major events of the Forerunner history had already been established through the information hidden in Halo 3. O'Connor said that the book is meant to have a [...] "hard sci-fi" [...] feel with a [...] "hint of space opera, in the mold of Banks, Reynolds and Bear himself." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{members of}} Our Lady Peace began writing new {{material}} together {{soon after the}} Gravity tour began. In October 2002 they returned briefly to Bob Rock's Maui studio to record two unfinished songs from Gravity that were planned to be released on a soundtrack, which never happened. [...] "Working with him on that soundtrack song was just another reaffirmation for us how well we work together," [...] Maida stated in an October interview. [...] "With the way this band has grown, and the way we've come to trust Bob, it would be ridiculous for us to look for another producer now. When we're all together, {{we feel like we}} can do anything. We have to go at least one more round with him. I think we just <b>scratched</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> of what we can do together." [...] By the end of 2002, the band was eager to re-enter the studio in Maui to begin laying down demos with Rock. Two new songs, [...] "Not Afraid" [...] and [...] "Talk is Cheap" [...] were premiered in March 2003 while touring in Europe with Avril Lavigne.|$|E

The {{unreleased}} material is [...] "some really out-there stuff, which hopefully will {{see the light of day}} at some point". Among these is a song Gorillaz wanted to record with Engelbert Humperdinck. [...] "He was supposed to do it, but then he declined, which was a real shame", Albarn explained to New York magazine. [...] "It's a very dramatic song, very moving. Arabic strings. It's imagining Earth losing its gravitational pull and starting to fall". As it turned out, Humperdinck's manager had listened to the proposed selection and declined the offer for him without his knowing. Humperdinck later stated in an interview that his manager declining the collaboration offer was [...] "the most grievous sin ever committed", and that he would have gladly collaborated with the Gorillaz if he had known they asked. With or without Humperdinck, Albarn insists the tune will eventually be released. [...] "I'm going to finish that off", he said. [...] "It just needs the vocal. We've made contact with Indian singer Asha Bhosle and I think it's definitely going to happen. I'll maybe duet with her; the song has these answering phrases". The band were also rebuffed by former Sex Pistols' frontman John Lydon and Tom Waits.|$|E

2500|$|Despite Clare {{showing a}} more [...] "vulnerable" [...] {{side in the}} weeks prior to her departure, in episodes that aired in July 2008, Bradley {{discovered}} her original plan to manipulate money from himself and other men in Walford, and subsequently shunned her, leaving Clare [...] "feeling isolated and unwanted by her closest friends and family". Bissix has discussed her character's departure and the [...] "softer side" [...] to Clare that emerged: [...] "she does genuinely care for [...] When he turns against her, {{it turns into a}} bit of a drunken mission for her and she wrecks Dot's house. When Dot comes back, she finds her {{in a bit of a}} state and hands her a Christianity leaflet. [...] actually sits and tries to pray". Kris Green from Digital Spy has suggested that the programme [...] "only really ever <b>scratched</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> with [...] " [...] and that there was still a lot that was undiscovered about the character, which Bissix has agreed with. She comments, [...] "This isn't a closed chapter. At the end of the day, she's been outed off the Square and with the character she is, she doesn't even know what's going on in her own head. Someone like Clare doesn't stick around Walford unless there's a reason. I like to believe in what I do and believe in my characters. I'm not going to stay in a job for no reason. Clare would definitely leave in this situation." [...] After one last [...] "huge row" [...] with Bradley and realising that she had no friends in Walford, Clare decided to leave, making her exit in an hour-long episode that aired on 7 August 2008. Discussing her exit, Bissix said, [...] "I leave Albert Square in the back of a Black Cab, of course! Which is how I left with Nigel 10 years ago so it feels kind of right. It’s better than going out in a [...] isn’t it? I don’t want to be killed off!" [...] She also revealed that she is hoping Clare Bates will return to EastEnders again one day, commenting, [...] "I don’t think it’s the end of Clare. I’m sure she’ll be back to cause trouble at some point." [...] In 2009, Bissix added that producers told her when she left in August 2008 that they were thinking of bringing her character back in a year or so. She added, [...] "but it's one of those things. I'll just have to wait and see." ...|$|E
