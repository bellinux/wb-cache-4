25|$|To be acceptable, any {{rule of law}} must {{be capable}} of being applied consistently, thus a {{definition}} of the criteria for this qualitative analysis must be supplied. Let us assume a purely factual analysis as a starting point. A injures B and leaves him lying in the road. C is a driver who fails to see B {{on the road and}} by running over him, contributes to the cause of his death. It would be possible to ask for a detailed medical evaluation at a post mortem to determine the initial degree of injury {{and the extent to which}} B's life was threatened, followed by a second set of injuries from the collision and their contribution. If the first incident merely damaged B's leg so that he could not move, it is tempting to assert that C's driving must have been the more <b>substantial</b> <b>cause</b> and so represents a novus actus breaking the chain. Equally, if B was bleeding to death and the only contribution that the driving made was to break B's arm, the driving is not a novus actus and does not break the chain. But this approach ignores the issue of A's foresight.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{the left}} {{considered}} {{reform of the}} anticlerical aspects of the constitution totally unacceptable, Historian Stanley Payne believed [...] "the Republic as a democratic constitutional regime was doomed from the outset", {{and it has been}} posited that such a [...] "hostile" [...] approach to the issues of church and state was a <b>substantial</b> <b>cause</b> of the breakdown of democracy and the onset of civil war. One legal commentator has stated plainly [...] "the gravest mistake of the Constitution of 1931—Spain's last democratic Constitution prior to 1978—was its hostile attitude towards the Catholic Church".|$|E
2500|$|Third party's {{inadvertent}} contribution R v Smith (1959) 2 QB 35 {{the defendant}} stabbed his victim {{twice in a}} barrack room brawl. Another soldier carried him to the medical centre but dropped him twice. The medical captain was very busy and failed to recognise {{the extent of the}} injuries. If the soldier had received proper treatment, he would have had a good chance of a complete recovery. Smith was convicted of manslaughter because the wound was the [...] "operating and <b>substantial</b> <b>cause</b> of death". [...] In R v Cheshire (1991) 3 AER 670, the victim was shot in the leg and stomach. In hospital, he suffered pneumonia and respiratory problems in intensive care so had a tracheotomy. After two months, he died. There was some medical negligence because the tracheotomy had caused a thickening of tissue ultimately causing suffocation. In upholding the conviction for murder, Beldam LJ laid down the following test: ...|$|E
2500|$|Third party's {{deliberate}} intervention R v Malcherek (1981) 73 Cr. App. R. 173. The {{victim was}} placed on a life support machine and, after determining that she was brain dead, the doctors turned off the machine. The defendant appealed the conviction of murder arguing that the doctors had broken the chain of causation [...] by deliberately switching off the life support machine. It was held that the original wounds were the operating and <b>substantial</b> <b>cause</b> of death, and that a life support machine does no more than hold {{the effect of the}} injuries in suspension and when the machine is switched off, the original wounds continue to cause the death no matter how long the victim survives after the machine's disconnection. In R v Pagett (1983) 76 Cr. App. R. 279, to resist lawful arrest, the defendant held a girl in front of him as a shield and shot at armed policemen. The police instinctively fired back and killed the girl. The Court of Appeal held that the defendant's act caused the death and that the reasonable actions of a third party acting in self-defence could not be regarded as a novus actus interveniens because self-defence is a foreseeable consequence of his action and had not broken the chain of causation.|$|E

5000|$|In S v Tembani, an {{important}} case in South African criminal law, especially {{in respect of}} the issue of legal causation, it seemed to the Witwatersrand Local Division, following the approach of English law, to be [...] "of overriding importance that the original wound inflicted by the accused was an operating and <b>substantial</b> <b>cause</b> of the death of the deceased." [...] If, at the time of death, the original wound is still an operating and <b>substantial</b> <b>cause</b> of death, then the death {{is a result of the}} wound, even if another cause was also operating. The court thus appeared to endorse the [...] "proximate-cause" [...] criterion, also known as direct-consequences or individualisation theory, of legal causation. The court added that death is not the result of the original wound if it is just the setting in which another cause operates. Only if the second cause is so overwhelming as to make the original wound merely part of the history may it be said that death does not flow from the wound.|$|E
