Cross-sectional. Colposcopy Clinic in a University hospital. A series of 119 women referred because of atypical <b>squamous</b> <b>cells</b> or LSIL between August 2000 and April 2001 were included. All women were subjected to a new cervical smear, HPV testing for the high-risk types using hybrid capture II (HCII), viral load measurement in relative light units (RLU) and colposcopy, with cervical biopsies (n = 97). Cervical lesions were graded using the CIN classification. Cervical biopsies revealed CIN 2 or CIN 3 in 11 % of the cases, equally among women referred because of atypical <b>squamous</b> <b>cells</b> or LSIL. The HCII test was positive in 16 % of women with atypical <b>squamous</b> <b>cells</b> and 52 % of those with LSIL (OR = 5. 8; 95 % CI 1. 4 to 26. 7). There was strong correlation between CIN 2 or CIN 3 and positivity for HPV DNA when this group was compared with women with only CIN 1 or normal cervix (OR = 7. 8; 95 % CI 1. 5 to 53. 4). In ROC analysis for HCII in diagnosing CIN 2 and CIN 3, the area under the ROC curve was 0. 784, and the viral load cutoff point of 10. 0 RLU/cutcuff presented 77 % sensitivity and 73 % specificity.

40|$|Infection {{with high}} risk Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{is the main}} known cause of cervical cancer. HPV induces different grades of lesions: among them, Atypical <b>squamous</b> <b>cells</b> of undetermined significance are abnormal lesions that could evolve in pre-cancer lesions or spontaneously regress. The mannose binding lectin (MBL) is an innate immunity serum protein also found in cervico-vaginal mucosa, whose expression {{is known to be}} affected by polymorphisms in exon 1 and promoter of the MBL 2 gene. In the present study the possible association between MBL 2 functional polymorphisms and susceptibility to develop atypical <b>squamous</b> <b>cells</b> of undetermined significance was investigated in a group of women from North-East of Italy, stratified for HPV infection status. The MBL 2 D and O alleles and the deficient producer combined genotypes, responsible for low MBL production, were more represented among atypical <b>squamous</b> <b>cells</b> of undetermined significance positive women than healthy controls and the results were confirmed when only HPV negative samples were considered.

OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of the study was}} to compare the incidence of invasive cervical cancer, following different management options pursued after an atypical <b>squamous</b> <b>cells</b> of undetermined significance/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion index smear. STUDY DESIGN: In this nationwide cohort study, we included all women aged 22 - 50 years and resident in Sweden 1989 - 2011 and with at least 1 cervical smear registered during the study period (n = 2, 466, 671). Followup of a first atypical <b>squamous</b> <b>cells</b> of undetermined significance/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cytological diagnosis within 25 months was classified as repeat cytology, colposcopy/biopsy, or without further assessment. Incidence rate ratios and 95 % confidence intervals of subsequent cervical cancer within 6. 5 years following atypical <b>squamous</b> <b>cells</b> of undetermined significance/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion were estimated using Poisson regression by age group and management strategy. RESULTS: Women managed with repeat cytology within 6 months after atypical <b>squamous</b> <b>cells</b> of undetermined significance or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cytology had a similar risk of cervical cancer compared with colposcopy/biopsy (incidence rate ratio, 1. 1, 95 % confidence interval, 0. 5 - 2. 5, and incidence rate ratio, 2. 0, 95 % confidence interval, 0. 6 - 6. 5, respectively) among women aged 22 - 27 years. For women aged 28 years and older, women managed with repeat cytology had a higher risk for cervical cancer than women managed with colposcopy/biopsy.
