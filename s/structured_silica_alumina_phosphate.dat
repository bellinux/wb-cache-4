40|$|Dimethyl ether (DME) is an industrially {{important}} intermediate, {{as well as}} {{a promising}} clean fuel, but the effective production through traditionally consecutive steps from syngas to methanol and then to DME has been hindered by the poorly organized structure of the conventional physical mixture catalyst. Here a Meso <b>structured</b> <b>Silica</b> <b>Alumina</b> support on which the catalyst Cu-ZnO has been impregnated was proposed to accomplish the DME direct synthesis from syngas. The catalysts has been characterized by techniques like BET surface area (N 2 adsorption studies), Temperature programmed Desorption (NH 3 - TPD), Temperature programmed Reduction (H 2 -TPR) and FTIR. Experimental set up and procedure for the synthesis has been discussed. The results obtained in these characterizations has been reported and analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: leaves 223 - 232. Alkylphenols are {{intermediates}} used in {{the synthesis}} of many important substances. The most signiﬁcant of the commercially important lower alkylphenols are cresols (methyl phenols) and xylenols (dimethyl phenols). The main markets for alkylphenol products are nonionic detergents, phenolic resins, polymer additives and agrochemicals. Of the western world cresol market, 55 % originates from synthetic cresols whereas 45 % originates from so-called “natural” cresols obtained from coal tars and reﬁnery caustics. The methylation of phenol is the only process speciﬁcally developed to produce cresols and xylenols. There are three cresol isomers, namely ortho, para and meta. It is possible to produce a high selectivity to o-cresol by alkylation of phenol with methanol over a basic or a Al 2 O 3 catalyst or a Fe/V catalyst. A mixture of the cresol isomers can be obtained over aluminium oxides with strong acid sites, <b>silica</b> <b>alumina,</b> zeolites, aluminium <b>phosphates</b> and phosphoric acid-Kieselguhr catalysts. However, direct synthesis of high purity m-cresol and p-cresol is desirable due to {{the high costs of}} separating these two isomers. Thus to synthesize p-cresol, a m-cresol free or very low m-cresol concentration in the product is desirable for puriﬁcation reasons and a high p/o-cresol ratio is also desirable in the product for yield reasons since separation of the p- and the o-cresols is economically possible...|$|R

Although a 3 wt% Re 2 O 7 /SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 /SnBu 4 is already active for the metathesis of unsaturated FAMEs, {{the results have}} shown that particle size of <b>silica</b> <b>alumina</b> support has a profound influence on its activity and selectivity. Consequently, high substrate conversions coupled with improved product yields (for mono- and diesters) and reaction rates were obtained upon using powder, as opposed to extrudate <b>silica</b> <b>alumina</b> as the support material.
