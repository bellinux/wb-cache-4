40|$|This {{tutorial}} paper {{gives an}} overview of the history and present state of the art in symbolic analysis of electronic circuits at the so-called circuit level. Symbolic analysis is defined as a technique generating a closed-form analytic expression for a <b>circuit</b> <b>characteristic</b> with the <b>circuit's</b> <b>elements</b> represented by symbols. Such analytic information complements the results from numerical simulations. The paper then describes the different application areas of symbolic analysis for the design of analog circuits. Symbolic analysis is mainly used as a means to obtain insight into a circuit's behavior, to generate analytic models for automated circuit sizing, and in applications requiring the repetitive evaluation of <b>circuit</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Next, the present capabilities and limitations of symbolic analysis, both in functionality and efficiency, are discussed. The major symbolic analysis methods are presented, and algorithmic details are provided for symbolic approximation, hierarchical decomposition, and symbolic distortion analysis. Finally, existing symbolic simulators are compared, and directions for future research are pointed out. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Several devices exhibiting memory {{effects have}} shown up in {{nonlinear}} circuit theory in recent years. Among others, these <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> include Chua's memristors, as well as memcapacitors and meminductors. These and other related devices seem to be beyond the, say, classical scope of circuit theory, which is formulated in terms of resistors, capacitors, inductors, and voltage and current sources. We explore in this paper the potential extent of nonlinear circuit theory by classifying such mem-devices {{in terms of the}} variables involved in their constitutive relations and the notions of the differential- and the state-order of a device. Within this framework, the frontier of first order circuit theory is defined by so-called hybrid memristors, which are proposed here to accommodate a characteristic relating all four fundamental circuit variables. Devices with differential order two and mem-systems are discussed in less detail. We allow for fully nonlinear <b>characteristics</b> in all <b>circuit</b> <b>elements,</b> arriving at a rather exhaustive taxonomy of C^ 1 -devices. Additionally, we extend the notion of a topologically degenerate configuration to circuits with memcapacitors, meminductors and all types of memristors, and characterize the differential-algebraic index of nodal models of such circuits.

40|$|Abstract—To {{judge whether}} the memristor can be {{interpreted}} as the fourth fundamental <b>circuit</b> <b>element,</b> we propose a variable-relation criterion of fundamental <b>circuit</b> <b>elements.</b> According to the criterion, we investigate the nature of three fundamental <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> and the memristor. From the perspective of variables relation, the memristor builds a direct relation between the voltage across it and the current through it, instead of a direct relation between the magnetic flux and the charge. Thus, it is better to characterize the memristor and the resistor as two special cases of the same fundamental <b>circuit</b> <b>element,</b> which is the memristive system in Chua’s new framework. Finally, the definition of memristor is refined according to the difference between the magnetic flux and the flux linkage...|$|R

30|$|In circuit quantum electrodynamics, the {{controllable}} {{interaction of}} <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> {{is a highly}} desirable resource for quantum computation and quantum simulation experiments. The most common method is a static capacitive or inductive coupling between cavities and/or qubits.

While this approach has proven to be useful for few coupled <b>circuit</b> <b>elements,</b> it seems impracticable for larger systems, where it is hard to provide sufficient detunings between all <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> [5]. Therefore, one may alternatively use tunable coupling elements such as qubits [6 – 9] or SQUIDs [10 – 15]. One particular example for an interesting application of such actively coupled <b>circuit</b> <b>elements</b> are quantum simulations of bosonic many-body Hamiltonians [16 – 20]. In such a scenario, the bosonic degrees of freedom can be represented by networks of (possibly nonlinear) superconducting resonators.

A more general scope of this device is the controllable routing of photonic states on a chip, which is interesting for quantum information as well as quantum simulation experiments.|$|R
