25|$|In 2005, it came {{to light}} that Shipman might have stolen {{jewellery}} from his victims. Over £10,000 worth of jewellery had been found <b>stashed</b> <b>in</b> his garage in 1998, and in March 2005, with Primrose Shipman asking {{for it to be}} returned to her, police wrote to the families of Shipman's victims asking them to identify the jewellery.|$|E
25|$|After {{the police}} arrive, Archie notices that an object has been <b>stashed</b> <b>in</b> {{the pocket of}} his topcoat. Concerned that he's being set up, Archie escapes the {{premises}} without examining the object. Back at Wolfe's house, the object is found to be a bloodstained fencing glove, in which a col de mort has been wrapped. A col de mort, it turns out, is a sharp metal fitting that can be attached to the end of an épée, so as to turn a relatively safe weapon into a deadly one.|$|E
25|$|Al-Bashir's {{long career}} has been riddled with war. Despite his pledge to end the 21-year civil war that had been {{carrying}} on {{when he took office}} in 1989, further conflict continued after that he prolonged. During the frequent fighting, Al-Bashir allegedly looted the impoverished nation of much of its wealth. According to leaked US diplomatic cables, $9billion of his siphoned wealth was <b>stashed</b> <b>in</b> London banks. Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the chief prosecutor, stated that some of the funds were being held in the part-nationalize Lloyds Banking Group. He also reportedly told US officials it was necessary to go public with the scale of Al-Bashir's extortion to turn public opinion against him.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} deal was finalised, Mitsubishi became embroiled in accusations that it had covered up {{complaints}} from customers about defects in their vehicles. A police raid on its headquarters in July 2000 uncovered hidden documents <b>stashed</b> <b>in</b> a locker, and soon after over 500,000 vehicles were recalled for repairs. Mitsubishi's shares fell by 13percent as these revelations became public, and over the summer, further investigations took a similar toll on the company's stock. By the end of August, following a second police raid, {{the total number of}} vehicles recalled had reached one million, while the share price had fallen by almost 30percent. As a result of the collapse in the value of Mitsubishi, DaimlerChrysler renegotiated a €200million reduction price of its stock purchase, while Kawasoe was forced to step down as chairman.|$|E

From a description provided by our source, I had easily identified the building in question, which was located in Baghdad's downtown Aadamiyah section. The ten crates of missile parts were <b>stashed</b> <b>in</b> a basement of the Baghdad headquarters of Saddam's own Ba'ath party. If we could achieve surprise and surround the site before the Iraqis could evacuate the crates, we would obtain the ultimate catch-22 situation: let us inside as promised and we would find the prohibited material; bar our entry and violate the Kofi Annan compromise, {{and in the process}} invite a devastating air strike by the United States. UNSCOM would be prepared to camp out around this site until the situation had been resolved one way or the other.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, {{the median}} strips of some autobahns were paved over {{to allow their}} {{conversion}} into auxiliary airstrips. Aircraft were either <b>stashed</b> <b>in</b> numerous tunnels or camouflaged in nearby woods. However, {{for the most part}} during the war, the autobahns were not militarily significant. Motor vehicles, such as trucks, could not carry goods or troops as quickly or in as much bulk and in the same numbers as trains could, and the autobahns could not be used by tanks as their weight and caterpillar tracks damaged the road surface. The general shortage of petrol in Germany during much of the war, as well as the low number of trucks and motor vehicles needed for direct support of military operations, further decreased the autobahn's significance. As a result, most military and economic freight was carried by rail. After the war, numerous sections of the autobahns were in bad shape, severely damaged by heavy Allied bombing and military demolition. Furthermore, thousands of kilometres of autobahns remained unfinished, their construction brought to a halt by 1943 due to the increasing demands of the war effort.|$|E

[...] At the end of the video, Lenoir has enough, and walks out. Montgomery notes that it is not clear whether Usher even makes it home, or if the song was even referring to the wife character, and not [...] "someone special <b>stashed</b> <b>in</b> a nearby suite."

500|$|Cordelia {{also appears}} in comic books and novels {{based on the}} Buffy and Angel {{television}} series. The Cordelia Collection, Vol. 1 by Nancy Krulik is a novelization of the Buffy episodes [...] "Out of Mind, Out of Sight", [...] "Some Assembly Required" [...] and [...] "Homecoming". These episodes tell specific incidents in which Cordelia becomes targeted: by a scorned classmate, to become a zombie's bride and by hunters {{in a case of}} mistaken identity. She appears in numerous Angel novels as a member of Angel Investigations, but some feature Cordelia more prominently; in Not Forgotten she uncovers exploitation of child immigrants, while in Haunted she appears as a contestant on a supernatural-themed reality television show when she has a vision about another applicant. Cordelia appears in the majority of Angel comics, published by Dark Horse Comics during 2000–2002 and set between episodes of the television series. She appears less frequently in those by IDW Publishing between 2005 and 2011, mainly in stories set in and after the fifth season. Cordelia typically plays a minimal role in the Dark Horse Angel comics. However, issue seventeen was a [...] "Cordelia Special", in which demonic items are <b>stashed</b> <b>in</b> Cordelia's apartment. In the Dark Horse Presents story [...] "Lovely dark and deep", Cordelia lands a role as the star of a demonic movie. Cordelia appears in the IDW Publishing comic mini-series , set after season five, in flashback scenes. She subsequently reappears in the mini-series , which sees Angel battle evil clones of his friends. Cordelia claims to be the genuine article, having returned from the dead, but Angel is unconvinced and kills her; his suspicions prove correct when her body immediately disintegrates like the other clones.|$|E
500|$|Preliminary {{results of}} studies on the pygmy slow loris {{indicate}} that its diet consists primarily of gums and nectar (especially nectar from Saraca dives flowers), and that animal prey makes up 30–40% of its diet. However, one 2002 analysis of pygmy slow loris feces indicated that it contained 98% insect remains and just 2% plant remains. The pygmy slow loris often returns to the same gum feeding sites and leaves conspicuous gouges on tree trunks when inducing the flow of exudates. Slow lorises have been reported gouging for exudates at heights ranging from [...] {{to as much as}} the gouging process, whereby the loris repetitively bangs its toothcomb into the hard bark, may be loud enough to be heard up to [...] away. The marks remaining after gouging can be used by field workers to assess loris presence in an area. Captive pygmy slow lorises also make characteristic gouge marks in wooden substrates, such as branches. It is not known how the sympatric pygmy and Bengal slow lorises partition their feeding niches. The plant gums, obtained typically from species in the family Fabaceae (peas), are high in carbohydrates and lipids, and can serve as a year-around source of food, or an emergency reserve when other preferred food items are scarce. Several anatomical adaptations present in slow lorises may enhance their ability to feed on exudates: a long narrow tongue {{to make it easier to}} reach gum <b>stashed</b> <b>in</b> cracks and crevices, a large cecum to help the animal digest complex carbohydrates, and a short duodenum to help quickly pass potentially toxic exudates. Slow lorises can use both hands to eat while hanging upside down from a branch. They spend about 20% of their nightly activities feeding.|$|E

2500|$|A {{judge ruled}} on 8 October 2002 that he was, therefore, fit to stand trial. This left Huntley facing life {{imprisonment}} if a jury {{were to be}} convinced of his guilt.
