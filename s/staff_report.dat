5|$|According to a Soviet General <b>Staff</b> <b>report,</b> 29 of the 35 major Luftwaffe {{raids on}} Soviet airfields in the Kursk sector in June 1943 were against dummy airfields. According to {{historian}} Antony Beevor, in contrast, Soviet aviation apparently succeeded in destroying more than 500 Luftwaffe aircraft on the ground. The Soviet deception efforts were {{so successful that}} German estimates issued in mid-June placed the total Soviet armoured strength at 1,500 tanks. The result {{was not only a}} vast underestimation of Soviet strength, but a misperception of Soviet strategic intentions.|$|E

25|$|Toronto City Council held public {{consultations}} on {{the proposal}} {{during the fall}} of 2013, leading to a city <b>staff</b> <b>report</b> addressing the proposal. At the same time, Porter mounted a public relations campaign, based around the porterplans.com web site. Porter customers were telephoned and e-mailed and radio and newspaper advertisements were bought by Porter asking {{for the public to}} register their support with Toronto Council. After the consultation, and study of consultant reports, City staff recommended in a report to delay acting on the proposal until 2015. Concerns about the required infrastructure, public health concerns and the lack of an airport master plan were cited by staff. The TPA was also seeking an extension of the airport management agreement as a condition of the proposal. City Council's Executive Committee on December 5 voted to delay consideration of the proposal until 2014.|$|E
25|$|On 31 December 2014, Modi {{announced}} that the Planning Commission had been scrapped. It was replaced with a body called the National Institution for Transforming India, or NITI Aayog. The Planning Commission was {{a legacy of the}} Indian Independence movement, although critics said that it was slowing economic growth. The new body includes the leaders of all 29 Indian states, but its full-time <b>staff</b> <b>report</b> directly to the prime minister. The move had the effect of greatly centralizing the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the prime minister. It also reduced the extent of control individual states had over their financial allocation from the union government, and unlike the planning commission, it does not have the power to allocate funds. The planning commission had received heavy criticism in previous years for creating inefficiency in the government, and of not filling its role of improving social welfare: however, since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice.|$|E

25|$|Settling {{into the}} Mayoral offices at City Hall, Johnson's first {{official}} engagement was an {{appearance at the}} Sikh celebrations for Vaisakhi in Trafalgar Square. His first policy initiative, issued that month, was a ban on drinking alcohol on public transport. He received criticism during the early weeks of his administration, largely because he was late to two official functions in his first week on the job, and because after three weeks he embarked on a holiday to Turkey. In July 2008 Johnson visited the closing ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, there offending his Chinese hosts with his attire. Rather than bringing a team of assistants {{with him to the}} job as Livingstone had done, Johnson built his team over the following six months. Those in City Hall who were deemed too closely allied to Livingstone's administration had their employment terminated. Johnson appointed Tim Parker to be first deputy mayor, but after Parker began taking increasing control at City Hall and insisted that all <b>staff</b> <b>report</b> directly to him, Johnson sacked him.|$|E

500|$|It {{was also}} {{possible}} to deploy radar decoys to confuse the defense. Decoys are made of lightweight materials, often strips of aluminum or mylar balloons, which can be packed in with the reentry vehicle (RV), adding little throw weight. In space, these are ejected to create a threat tube a few kilometers across and tens of kilometers long. Zeus had to get within about [...] to kill a warhead, which could be anywhere in the tube. The WSEG suggested that a single ICBM with decoys would almost certainly defeat Zeus. Considering a large missile with multiple warheads, a summer 1961 <b>staff</b> <b>report</b> by ARPA suggested a single missile could require four entire Zeus batteries to defeat it, making the system impractical.|$|E

500|$|On the Soviet side, all {{the tank}} units under Rotmistrov's 5th Guards Tank Army {{involved}} in the battle on 12 July suffered heavy losses. Rotmistrov later wrote that the 29th Tank Corps lost 60 percent of its armour and the 18th Tank Corps lost 30 percent on 12 July. A Soviet General <b>Staff</b> <b>report</b> recorded: [...] "Thus on 12 July, the 5th Guards Tank Army failed to accomplish its assigned mission. As {{a result of the}} frontal attack, the army's corps fought heavy battles against large enemy tank forces during which they were forced to assume defence." [...] Rotmistrov was forced to shift the 18th and 29th Tank Corps over to defence and reinforce them with infantry. They dug more trenches, dug in some of their tanks, laid new minefields, prepared anti-tank strong points and massed their artillery. The 10th Guards Mechanized and 24th Guards Tank Brigades of the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps made preparations to push Totenkopf back the next morning.|$|E
500|$|Under Johnson's proposal, {{there would}} be no change in the cent or nickel, but the dime and quarter would be made with a clad composition, that is {{copper-nickel}} bonded to a core of pure copper; the half dollar would have 80 percent silver faces and the core would contain 21 percent silver. [...] The clad alloy had similar electrical properties to silver, and so would work in existing vending machines. He also sent the Treasury <b>Staff</b> <b>Report</b> on which his recommendations were based. [...] This report had been expected in February, but had been repeatedly delayed, in part because outgoing Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon felt that his successor should approve the plan, as he would {{have to live with the}} consequences. The new secretary, Henry H. Fowler, had needed time to study the problem, further delaying the report's issuance. If adopted, the bill would reduce the need for silver in U.S. coinage by 90 percent.|$|E
500|$|Metro {{officials}} considered shifting construction {{funds from}} the southern Green Line to the northern Green Line in order to start construction on that end of the line, but the D.C. City Council opposed this shift. Metro held the court-ordered hearings in June 1982, at which Prince George's residents argued that they had voted for Metro's 1968 bond issue based on the original Green Line route. Metro promised attendees at the hearing that agency staff would study the Green Line route and issue a report recommending a route, after which construction on the Anacostia River tunnel would begin. The site of the tunnel thus became an issue, with some residents arguing for a tunnel from the Navy Yard under Anacostia Park to Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE, while others wanted the tunnel {{to take a more}} northerly route alongside the 11th Street Bridges to Good Hope Road SE. In October 1982, Metro estimated that opening of the Green Line to Anacostia would happen in the [...] "late 1980s", and in November a Metro <b>staff</b> <b>report</b> recommended construction of the Rosecroft Raceway route.|$|E

500|$|According to an MTV News <b>staff</b> <b>report,</b> as of July 2006, {{more than}} two {{thousand}} people had signed an online petition addressed to Beyoncé's record label, Columbia, demanding a reshoot for the video. By the end of August 2006, 5000 additional fans had signed it. The petition requested the clip to be taped again because it {{was considered to be}} [...] "an underwhelming representation of the talent and quality of previous music-video projects of Ms. Beyoncé". Included in the laundry list of offenses were [...] "a lack of theme, dizzying editing, over-the-top wardrobe choices, and unacceptable interactions" [...] between Beyoncé and her now-husband, Jay-Z. Beyoncé's dance moves were also called into question by the petition, qualifying them [...] as [...] "erratic, confusing and alarming at times". Additionally, fans complained about sexual theme depicted in the video, describing that some scenes as [...] "unacceptable interactions [...] " [...] while also complaining of a [...] "non-existent sexual chemistry" [...] between the two.

500|$|The {{adoption}} of the [...] "thirty-year rule" [...] in 1967 made available many of the papers of the Chamberlain government over the subsequent three years, helping to explain why Chamberlain acted as he did. The resultant works greatly fuelled the revisionist school, although they also included books that strongly criticised Chamberlain, such as Keith Middlemas's 1972 Diplomacy of Illusion (which portrayed Chamberlain as a seasoned politician with strategic blindness {{when it came to}} Germany). Released papers indicated that, contrary to claims made in Guilty Men, Chamberlain had neither ignored the advice of the Foreign Office nor had he disregarded and run roughshod over his Cabinet. Other released papers showed that Chamberlain had considered seeking a grand coalition amongst European governments like that later advocated by Churchill, but had rejected it on the ground that the division of Europe into two camps would make war more, not less likely. They also showed that Chamberlain had been advised that the Dominions, pursuing independent foreign policies under the Statute of Westminster, had indicated that Chamberlain could not depend on their help {{in the event of a}} Continental war.
