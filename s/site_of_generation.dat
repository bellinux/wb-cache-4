The hypothesis that the cardiac impact of ONOO- formation depends on its <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>generation,</b> intravascular or intramyocardial, was examined. Cardiac contractility was assessed by pressure-volume analysis to delineate vascular versus cardiac changes on direct infusion of ONOO- into the right atria of conscious dogs both with normal cardiac function and in heart failure. Additionally, ONOO- was administered to isolated murine cardiomyocytes to mimic in situ cardiac generation. When infused in vivo, ONOO had little impact on inotropy but led to systemic arterial dilation, likely {{as a result}} of rapid decomposition to NO 2 - and NO 3 -. In contrast, infused ONOO- was long lived enough to abolish beta-adrenergic (dobutamine) -stimulated contractility/relaxation, most likely through catecholamine oxidation to aminochrome. When administered to isolated murine cardiomyocytes, ONOO- induced a rapid reduction in sarcomere shortening and whole cell calcium transients, although neither decomposed ONOO- or NaNO 2 had any effect. Thus, systemic generation of ONOO- is unlikely to have primary cardiac effects, but may modulate cardiac contractile reserve, via blunted beta-adrenergic stimulation, and vascular tone, {{as a result of}} generation of NO 2 - and NO 3. However, myocyte generation of ONOO- may impair contractile function by directly altering Ca 2 + handling. These data demonstrate that the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>generation</b> within the cardiovascular system largely dictates the ability of ONOO- to directly or indirectly modulate cardiac pump function.

The equilibrium forward reaction rate constant (k(f) (eq)) has negative activation energy, in contrast to that found under irreversible conditions. In contradiction to the law of mass action, we demonstrate that the equilibrium constant depends on ONOO(-) concentration. Therefore, a wide range of k(f) (eq) values could be derived (7. 5 - 21 × 10 (9) M(- 1) s(- 1)). Of general interest, the variations in k(f) can thus be explained by its dependence on the distance between ONOO(-) particles (<b>sites</b> <b>of</b> <b>generation</b> <b>of</b> (*) NO and O(2) (*-)) ...|$|R

Considering the large specific surface area, which is desirable to disperse and stabilize the inorganic nanoparticles, the combination of BiVO 4 and graphene may effectively inhibit the aggregation of these nanoparticles and consequently give a higher photocatalytic performance. Recently, Ng et al. prepared a graphene decorated BiVO 4 through a facile photocatalytic reaction to improve its photo-response in visible light and found remarkable enhancement in photoelectrochemical water splitting compared to pure BiVO 4 under visible illumination. This enhancement {{is due to the}} longer electron lifetime of excited BiVO 4 as the electrons are injected to graphene instantly at the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>generation,</b> leading to a minimized charge recombination [20].

Abnormal patterns of circadian rhythms are associated with a large variety of affective disorders including depression. Sleep disruption {{is one of the major}} symptoms in depression,with majority of patients with major depression reporting difficulties with their sleep. Inhumans, the »biological clock« is the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>generation</b> of entrainment of circadian rhythms. It is located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the anterior hypothalamus and is functionally interconnected with the melatonergic system. Melatonergic receptors type 1 and 2 participate in the regulation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus activity. When stimulated,receptors type 1 mediate the amplitude of the suprachiasmatic nucleus activity while receptors type 2 control phase shifting of the same activity. On the neurobiological level, depression is complex mood disorder that is also associated with the functional impairment ofseveral central nervous systems including noradrenergic, serotonergic and dopaminergictransmitters and several hormonal systems. CONCLUSIONS There is a grooving evidence that dysfunction in circadian rhythm regulation andmelatonergic system function is involved in depression pathogenesis.

Mitochondria are increasingly considered the major O⋅− 2 source in a great variety of diseases and the aging process. Contradictory reports on mitochondrial O⋅− 2 release prompted us to critically investigate frequently used O⋅− 2 detection methods for their suitability. Due to the impermeability of the external mitochondrial membrane for most constituents of O⋅− 2 detection systems we decided to follow the stable dismutation product H 2 O 2. This metabolite was earlier shown to readily permeate into the cytosol. With the exception of tetramethylbenzidine none of the chemical reactants indicating the presence of H 2 O 2 by horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed absorbance change were suited due to solubility problems or low extinction coefficients. Tetramethylbenzidine-dependent H 2 O 2 detection was counteracted by rereduction of the dye through e− carriers of the respiratory chain. Although the fluorescent dyes scopoletin and homovanillic acid were found to be suited for the detection of mitochondrial H 2 O 2 release, fluorescence change was strongly affected by mitochondrial protein constituents. The present study has resolved this problem by separating the detection system from H 2 O 2 -producing mitochondria...|$|E

40|$|To {{understand}} the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in oxidative stress and redox signaling {{it is necessary to}} link their <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>generation</b> to the oxidative modification of specific targets. Here we have studied the selective modification of protein thiols by mitochondrial ROS that have been implicated as deleterious agents in a number of degenerative diseases and in the process of biological aging, but also as important players in cellular signal transduction. We hypothesized that this bipartite role might be based on different generator sites for "signaling" and "damaging" ROS and a directed release into different mitochondrial compartments. Because two main mitochondrial ROS generators, complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) and complex III (ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase; cytochrome bc 1 complex), are known to predominantly release superoxide and the derived hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) into the mitochondrial matrix and the intermembrane space, respectively, we investigated whether these ROS generators selectively oxidize specific protein thiols. We used redox fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis analysis to identify redox-sensitive targets in the mitochondrial proteome of intact rat heart mitochondria. We observed that the modified target proteins were distinctly different when complex I or complex III was employed as the source of ROS. These proteins are potential targets involved in mitochondrial redox signaling and may serve as biomarkers to study the generator-dependent dual role of mitochondrial ROS in redox signaling and oxidative stress...|$|E

Little is known about neural processes underlying the scale illusion. In this magnetoencephalographic study, we recorded steady-state responses to amplitude-modulated short tones having illusion-inducing pitch sequences, where the sound level of the modulated tones was manipulated to decrease monotonically with increase in pitch.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of particle-induced genotoxicity {{have been investigated}} mainly with asbestos fibers. The results are summarized and discussed in this paper. DNA damage can be produced by oxidoreduction processes generated by fibers. The extent of damage yield depends on experimental conditions: if iron is present, either on fibers or in the medium, damage is increased. However, iron reactivity does not explain all the results obtained in cell-free systems, as breakage of plasmid DNA was not directly associated {{with the amount of}} iron released by the fibers. The proximity of DNA to the <b>site</b> <b>of</b> <b>generation</b> of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is important because these species have an extremely short half-life. Damage to cellular DNA can be produced by oxidoreduction processes that originate from cells during phagocytosis. Secondary molecules that are more stable than ROS are probably involved in DNA damage. Oxidoreduction reactions originating from cells can induce mutations. Genotoxicity is also demonstrated by chromosomal damage associated with impaired mitosis, as evidenced by chromosome missegregation, spindle changes, alteration of cell cycle progression, formation of aneuploid and polyploid cells, and nuclear disruption. In some of these processes, the particle state and fiber dimensions are considered important parameters in the generation of genotoxic effects. - Environ Health Perspect 105 (Suppl 5) : 1073 - 1084 (1997) Key words: asbestos, genotoxicity, in vitro cell systems, lung cancer, man-made fibers...|$|E
