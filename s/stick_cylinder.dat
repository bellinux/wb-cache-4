40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with maintenance on a heavy equipment excavator 390 D series HE 4019, {{one of the main}} tools used to support the process of nickel production. Major constraint in using this tool is an insufficiently planned maintenance such that the tool affected operational and production process of nickel. Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) method is used to identify the risks of failure of critical components on the performance of the unit. Based on risk priority number (RPN), three critical components are found as leading causes of unit downtime. These are <b>stick</b> <b>cylinder</b> (RPN 288), fuel filter (RPN 280) and oil pan (RPN 240), respectively. Mean time between failure (MTBF) scores of <b>stick</b> <b>cylinder,</b> fuel filter and oil pan are 1, 288. 91 hours, 334. 04 hours and 1, 455. 77 hours, respectively. Each of making rod of the cylinder covered, periodically flushing the fuel tank and taking on a warning sign on the couplers and coating the gasket with an additional layer during installation, in the meantime, are proposed as preventive maintenance for each the three critical components...|$|E

50|$|Care must {{be taken}} when {{replacing}} gas cylinders that the bodok seal does not <b>stick</b> to the <b>cylinder</b> face when the cylinder is replaced and is thus 'lost' when the new cylinder is fitted and is therefore impossible to achieve a gas tight seal.|$|R
50|$|The {{prediction}} {{begins with}} the cup storing {{a number of the}} sticks. After the querent has finished their devotions to the main deity, the querent purifies the cylinder by revolving it around the incense burner three times and mixing the sticks by hand. The querent kneels in prayer, holding the cup between their palms and asking their question to the deity, either aloud or by whispering. This part needs to be done decisively as one should not shift questions or hesitate on the question {{in the middle of the}} rite. The shaking of the cylinder, which is usually tipped slightly downward, results in at least one <b>stick</b> leaving the <b>cylinder</b> and being dropped onto the floor. In most cases, if multiple <b>sticks</b> leave the <b>cylinder,</b> those fortunes do not count and must be shaken again. Each stick, with its designated number, represents one answer.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{formation}} of soot {{is influenced by}} the composition of air entrainment and structure of hydrocarbon in the fuel. Soot will then form during combustion in a diesel engine. Some of the soot particles will be released from the engine through the exhaust nozzle and some will <b>stick</b> to the <b>cylinder</b> walls. The soot that <b>sticks</b> to the <b>cylinder</b> wall can affect the lifetime of the lubricant oil. Subsequently this will decrease the durability of the diesel engine. By understanding the movement of the soot particles, the effect to the engine can be decreased. Therefore, the initial position and last position of soot particle was recognized through this study. The data for the {{formation of}} soot particles in the diesel engine was obtained from previous investigation. The study of soot movement at 8 ° crankshaft angle under the influence of drag force with different radial, axial and angular settings were carried out using a MATLAB routine. The results showed that the movement of soot particle will change with different parameter settings. Besides that, comparison of the results of soot particle movement influenced by drag force and without drag force has been carried out. It was observed that drag force caused shorter soot particle movement path and moves them away from the cylinder wall...|$|R
40|$|Double arm Master-Slave (M-S) {{manipulator}} {{has been}} {{attracted the attention}} of the robotics researchers today. The micro surgery is one of the big targets which M-S manipulator is expected to effectively perform. This paper describes about the human in the loop (HIL) simulator consisted of the prototype master manipulator and the virtual simulator of slave manipulator. Today, we have a challenge injecting drugs to a chick embryo’s blood vessels that are enough cultured in an artificial eggshell. The M-S manipulator is expected to apply for such a work like a micro surgery, ex. catching a blood vessel and <b>sticking</b> a <b>cylinder.</b> The embryo is extremely sensitive so that M-S manipulator should have both high operability and high accuracy movement. To evaluate the M-S manipulator quantitatively, we develop the human in the loop (HIL) simulator. The simulator is consisted with the prototype master manipulator and the virtual slave manipulator...|$|R
50|$|For the VIC-20, Commodore International {{introduced}} a joystick that was essentially {{identical to the}} Atari model with the exception that the top plate on the base was white instead of black. This prompted Atari to sue for patent violations. Commodore responded by introducing the 1311, a modified version that made the case more rectangular, changed the <b>stick</b> from a <b>cylinder</b> to a triangle, and replaced the single round fire button with a larger one running {{across the top of}} the stick, making it suitable for use in either hand. These changes also rendered it painful to use and it was widely panned.|$|R
5000|$|On the way home, Hartney and his gunner {{got into}} eleven more skirmishes, {{clearing}} three incidental machine gun jams. In one skirmish, they tailed another German {{and sent him}} down in a smoking plunge to earth for what was officially another [...] "out of control" [...] win. By the time the FE.2d landed, the gunner had run one gun dry; the other was jammed. The plane was a bullet-riddled wreck, trailing torn fabric. Seven bullets stuck in the engine's water jacket bled off its coolant, and the engine [...] "froze", with four of its Rolls-Royce pistons <b>sticking</b> to their <b>cylinder</b> walls. Tattered streamers of fabric torn by bullets trailed from the biplane. Somehow, the crew was uninjured.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{methodology}} is proposed to obtain non-dimensional distributions {{of the local}} mean velocity in an equilibrium boundary layer over a rigid submerged vegetation. The obtained non dimensional distributions are independent of the considered test sections and hydrodynamic conditions and {{are linked to the}} macroscopic characteristics of the boundary layer itself. The methodology is applied to local mean velocity distributions experimentally obtained in the layer of the current which flows over the vegetation. Vegetation has been modelled through brass <b>cylinder</b> <b>sticks</b> and a synthetic grass carpet. Velocities have been measured through an LDA system in different test sections and hydrodynamic conditions. Therefore, the results show the presence of a universal velocity distribution law, valid for an equilibrium boundary layer outside of the vegetated bottom, likewise already obtained in literature for uniform flows...|$|R
30|$|No similar {{standard}} exists yet {{to repeat}} this procedure for the depth axis, but through testing for planarity [20] precision, we measured the effective depth resolution to be 9.2 µm. The planarity target {{was made on}} a flat plane with a few hundred flat-topped <b>cylinders</b> <b>sticking</b> out of it with a discrete and known height. Our effective depth resolution then resulted from the observed planarity of the tops {{of each of these}} cylinders. The accuracy was measured through the capture of several checkerboards. The 3 -D locations of all corners in the checkerboard were then measured, and it was then checked how well they fit into the real flat checkerboard (with the checkers in a fixed grid). The difference in distance of the real position of each corner and our sampled position then produced the accuracy. This was repeated for multiple orientations. The depth accuracy was found to be 38 µm.|$|R
5000|$|A Moto Guzzi Technical Services {{representative}} {{tried to}} explain to LA Times columnist Susan Carpenter that Moto Guzzi engines are [...] "called 'transverse' because the engine is mounted with the crankshaft oriented front to back instead of left to right." [...] In spite of this, it could be assumed that those who call V-twin motorcycle engines [...] "transverse" [...] when they are mounted with the crankshaft front-to-back and the <b>cylinders</b> <b>sticking</b> out the sides are saying that to them, the engine's axis is the line passing from one cylinder to the other, at a right angle to the crankshaft, rather than going by the crankshaft's axis. Highly technical sources, such as V. Cossleter's Motorcycle Dynamics, or Gaetaeno Cocco's Motorcycle Design and Technology are careful not simply to use the terms [...] "longitudinal engine" [...] or [...] "transverse engine," [...] but rather to specify that they mark the engine's orientation based on the crankshaft, and so they will say [...] "transverse crankshaft engine" [...] or [...] "longitudinal crankshaft engine", or, conversely, [...] "transversely mounted cylinders" [...] in referenced to the classic BMW orientation, with a longitudinal crankshaft and cylinders at a right angle to the axis of the frame.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{a diesel}} engine, soot was {{produced}} due to incomplete fuel combustion in a combustion chamber. Some of this soot <b>sticks</b> to the <b>cylinder</b> wall and interferes with lubricant oil. This soot causes the lubricant oil to contaminate and this increases its viscosity. Contamination of lubricant oil {{is one of}} the major causes of engine wear. Therefore, the focus of this study is on soot movement in diesel engine that is the initial step to avoid contamination of lubricant oil. This work uses the data of the formation of soot particles from Kiva- 3 v obtained from previous investigation and then simulated it by a Matlab routine. Kiva- 3 v produced velocity vectors of the soot, fuel, temperature, pressure and others. Matlab routine uses trilinear interpolation and fourth order Runge Kutta method in order to calculate soot movement in a combustion chamber. In addition, the influence of drag force is considered in the calculation to achieve a higher accuracy. The objective of this study is to compare soot particle movement between 8 ° ATDC and 18 ° ATDC. Results show that 8 ° ATDC has a high risk to contaminate lubrication oil in certain location compare to 18 ° ATDC...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper compares a {{range of}} {{compartment}} models for diffusion MRI data on in vivo human acquisitions from a standard 60 mT/m system (Philips 3 T Achieva) and a unique 300 mT/m system (Siemens Connectom). The key aim is to determine whether both systems support broadly the same models or whether the Connectom higher gradient system supports significantly more complex models. A single volunteer underwent 8 h of acquisition on each system to provide uniquely wide and dense sampling of the available space of pulsed-gradient spin-echo (PGSE) measurements. We select a set of promising models from the wide set of possible three-compartment models for in vivo white matter (WM) that previous work and preliminary experiments suggest as strong candidates, but extend them to fit for compartmental T 2 and diffusivity. We focus on the corpus callosum where the WM fibre architecture is simplest and compare their ability to explain the measured data, using Akaike's information criterion (AIC), and to predict unseen data, using cross-validation. We also compare the stability of parameter estimates {{in the presence of}} i) noise, using bootstrapping, and ii) spatial variation, using visual assessment and comparison with anatomical knowledge. Broadly similar models emerge from the AIC and cross-validation experiments in both data sets. Specifically, a three-compartment model consisting of either a Bingham distribution of <b>sticks</b> or a <b>Cylinder</b> for the intracellular compartment, an anisotropic diffusion tensor (DT) model for the extracellular compartment, as well as an isotropic CSF compartment, performs consistently well. However, various other models also perform well and no single model emerges as clear winner. The WM data (with virtually no CSF contamination) do not support compartmental T 2 but partially support compartmental diffusivity. Evaluation of parameter stability favours simpler models than those identified by AIC or cross-validation. They suggest that the level of complexity in models underpinning currently popular microstructure imaging techniques such as NODDI, CHARMED, or ActiveAx, where the number of free parameters is about 4 or 5 rather than 10 or 11, may reflect the level of complexity achievable for a useful technique on current systems, although the 300 mT/m data may support more complex models...|$|R
