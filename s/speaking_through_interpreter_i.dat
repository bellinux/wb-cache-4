Jorissen and Bok marvelled at Kruger, {{in their eyes}} more suited to the 17th century than his own time. One night, when Kruger heard the two Dutchmen discussing celestial bodies {{and the structure of}} the universe, he interjected that if their conversation was accurate and the Earth was not flat, he might as well throw his Bible overboard. At the Colonial Office in Whitehall, Carnarvon and Kruger's own colleagues were astonished when, <b>speaking</b> <b>through</b> <b>interpreters,</b> he rose to what Meintjes calls [...] "remarkable heights of oratory", averring that the annexation breached the Sand River Convention and went against the popular will in the Transvaal. His arguments were undermined by reports to the contrary from Shepstone and other British officials, and by a widely publicised letter from a Potchefstroom vicar claiming that Kruger only represented the will of [...] "a handful of irreconcilables". Carnarvon dismissed Kruger's idea of a general plebiscite and concluded that British rule would remain.|$|R

2500|$|In 184 BC Flamininus was {{expelled}} from the Senate by the Censor, Cato the Elder, reportedly for unbecoming conduct during his consulship. In a speech before the Senate, Cato accused Flamininus {{of a number of}} charges, including being a pederast, a practice which he had picked up in Greece. Cato reported that during his consulship, Flamininus took his mistress with him to the north of Italy. Whilst there, a noble Boii and his family sought sanctuary in Flamininus’ tent. As the mistress had often told Flamininus that she had never seen a man die, the consul turned to her and asked her whether she wanted to see a Gaul die. The Boii noble was still <b>speaking</b> <b>through</b> an <b>interpreter</b> when Flamininus ordered his lictor to behead the Boii noble. However Anthony Everitt provides a different possible version of events. On page 305 of his book The Rise of Rome he says that Flamininus had been jokingly enticed by his young male lover and prostitute, Phillipus the Carthaginian, to make up for dragging Phillipus away from Rome and missing the Gladiatorial games, upon which Flamininus had a Celt seeking asylum called in and ran him through personally with his gladius. Everitt goes on to explain, on page 448, [...] "There are variations on this story, one being that the boy was a girl, another that the man killed was a condemned criminal rather than a distinguished Celt, a third that the prostitute requested the execution and, finally, that the deed was done by the lictor, not the consul himself. However in his account of the affair, Livy (39 42) claims to have read the speech Cato made about the affair, {{and there is no reason}} to doubt him. Cato's version is likely to be the nearest to the truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|I went {{myself to}} visit the native village on the hill behind Dorey, and took with me a small present of cloth, knives, and beads, to secure the good-will of the chief, and get him to send some men to catch or shoot birds for me. The houses were {{scattered}} about among rudely cultivated clearings. Two which I visited consisted of a central passage, {{on each side of}} which opened short passages, admitting to two rooms, each of which was a house accommodating a separate family. They were elevated at least fifteen feet above the ground, on a complete forest of poles, and were so rude and dilapidated that some of the small passages had openings in the floor of loose sticks, through which a child might fall. The inhabitants seemed rather uglier than those at Dorey village. They are, no doubt, the true indigenes of this part of New Guinea, living in the interior, and subsisting by cultivation and hunting. The Dorey men, on the other hand, are shore-dwellers, fishers and traders in a small way, and have thus the character of a colony who have migrated from another district. These hillmen or [...] "Arfaks" [...] differed much in physical features. They were generally black, but some were brown like Malays. Their hair, though always more or less frizzly, was sometimes short and matted, instead of being long, loose, and woolly; and this seemed to be a constitutional difference, not the effect of care and cultivation. Nearly half of them were afflicted with the scurfy skin-disease. The old chief seemed much pleased with his present, and promised (<b>through</b> an <b>interpreter</b> <b>I</b> brought with me) to protect my men when they came there shooting, and also to procure me some birds and animals. While conversing, they smoked tobacco of their own growing, in pipes cut from a single piece of wood with a long upright handle.|$|R
