5|$|Meanwhile, Jenna {{gets into}} trouble after she is misquoted in Maxim magazine, {{allegedly}} saying that <b>she</b> <b>hates</b> the troops. This happened due to Jenna mishearing the interviewer and thinking he meant theater troupes. The resulting outrage prompts Jack {{to get her}} an interview on Hardball with Chris Matthews to clear up the confusion over her comments. During the interview, Jenna confuses Osama bin Laden and then-Senator Barack Obama, who was running for the Democratic Party nomination for President. A further attempt to clear Jenna's name backfires when swastikas are accidentally brandished on the TGS with Tracy Jordan stage.|$|E
5|$|The reader {{progressively}} learns their history. Dobroselova originally {{lived in}} the country, but moved to St. Petersburg (which <b>she</b> <b>hates)</b> when her father lost his job. Her father becomes very violent and her mother severely depressed. Her father dies and they move in with Anna Fyodorovna, a landlady who was previously cruel to them but at least pretends to feel sympathy for their situation. Dobroselova is tutored by a poor student named Pokrovsky, whose drunken father occasionally visits. She eventually {{falls in love with}} Pokrovsky. She struggles to save a measly amount of money to purchase the complete works of Pushkin at the market for his birthday present, then allows his father to give the books to him instead, claiming that just knowing he received the books will be enough for her happiness. Pokrovsky falls ill soon after, and his dying wish is to see the sun and the world outside. Dobroselova obliges by opening the blinds to reveal grey clouds and dirty rain. In response Pokrovsky only shakes his head and then passes away. Dobroselova's mother dies shortly afterwards, and Dobroselova is left in the care of Anna for a time, but the abuse becomes too much and she goes to live with Fedora across the street.|$|E

60|$|She {{would not}} love {{him in a}} house any more. <b>She</b> said <b>she</b> <b>hated</b> houses, and {{particularly}} <b>she</b> <b>hated</b> beds. There was something distasteful in his coming to her bed.|$|R
60|$|Mishcha wagged slowly her old head. <b>She</b> <b>hated</b> the Oomgar, but <b>she</b> <b>hated</b> the Beast of Shadows more, and off she hopped again, {{stiff and}} cold, {{to seek out}} Thimble and Thumb.|$|R
5000|$|Millie Strathorn who {{sometimes}} confuses reality and fiction, believed that everything {{happening on the}} soap opera was real. Because <b>she</b> <b>hated</b> Rick's character, <b>she</b> <b>hated</b> Rick, so <b>she</b> submitted storylines that killed off Rick to the show’s writers. However, the writers never included any of her stories in the show.|$|R

25|$|Crystal Steele (Lisa Edelstein): one of {{the best}} Blade Runners on the job, and an expert in {{undercover}} work. <b>She</b> <b>hates</b> replicants, believing they should be exterminated.

60|$|The man's {{face and}} figure haunted {{her for it}} was the face and the figure of one whom she had learnt to <b>hate.</b> Yes! <b>She</b> <b>hated</b> him for his treason to Cæsar, for his {{allegiance}} to that rebel from Galilee; <b>she</b> <b>hated</b> every word which he had spoken in that arrogant, masterful way of his, when he smiled upon her threats and calmly spoke of immortality. <b>She</b> <b>hated</b> the voice which perpetually rang in her ear, the voice with which he spoke of his own soul being in the keeping of God--of One Whose Empire is mightier than that of Rome.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>hated</b> herself, <b>she</b> {{wanted to}} trample on herself, destroy herself. How could one become free? <b>She</b> <b>hated</b> religion, because it lent itself to her confusion. She abused {{everything}}. She {{wanted to become}} hard, indifferent, brutally callous to everything but just the immediate need, the immediate satisfaction. To have a yearning towards Jesus, only that she might use him to pander to her own soft sensation, use him {{as a means of}} reacting upon herself, maddened her in the end. There was then no Jesus, no sentimentality. With all the bitter hatred of helplessness <b>she</b> <b>hated</b> sentimentality.|$|R

25|$|Contrary to speculations, he did {{not leave}} the music {{industry}} at all.

On second thoughts, however, he had returned, in the hope-- ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>hated</b> {{him for the}} smile, for his masterful air, {{which seemed}} to imply that he humoured her because he scorned to use authority, but that when he did use it, hers must it be to obey him. Again she felt that {{everlasting}} calm, arguing such latent forces, was the thing <b>she</b> <b>hated</b> most in him.|$|R

He then kisses her on the lips and promises to give Asagiri a moonstone necklace for their wedding. Before he gets killed by Enju, he presents her with the necklace. Being a snow spirit like Asagiri, he also had the power of snow. Soul Symbol: Purity.|$|E

Shortly after {{breaking}} out of the mall with the group, she attempts to save a frightened student trapped {{on top of a}} truck in the parking lot. She and Shimada distract the zombies long enough for the student to escape, however Asami herself becomes trapped without any more bullets. Asami shouts that <b>she</b> <b>hates</b> Kohta, although Takashi immediately recognizes and tells Kohta that she is just yelling to attract the zombies so that they can escape. She shouts out one final request for Kohta not to allow her to become a zombie, and Kohta sadly aims his rifle at her head as she salutes goodbye.|$|E
25|$|Detective novelist Ariadne Oliver is Agatha Christie's humorous self-caricature. Like Christie, she is {{not overly}} fond of the detective whom she is most famous for creating–in Ariadne's case, Finnish sleuth Sven Hjerson. We never learn {{anything}} about her husband, {{but we do know}} that <b>she</b> <b>hates</b> alcohol and public appearances and has a great fondness for apples until she is put off them by the events of Hallowe'en Party. She also has a habit of constantly changing her hairstyle, and in every appearance by her much is made of her clothes and hats. Her maid Maria prevents the public adoration from becoming too much of a burden on her employer, but does nothing to prevent her from becoming too much of a burden on others.|$|E

It was a {{pleasant}} place among a few trees, {{at the end of a}} tiny garden, on the edge of a field. Her Uncle Tom and Winifred seemed to jeer at her, to cheapen her. She was miserable and desolate. But she would never give way.|$|R

6000|$|And so I came {{to realize}} how cruel {{must have been the}} pang that had driven her to this.
