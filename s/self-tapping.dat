5000|$|Sheet metal screws (sometimes called [...] "sheet-metal self-tappers", or P-K screws {{from the}} brand name Parker Kalon - who pioneered the {{manufacture}} of, but did not invent, these screws) are a type of <b>self-tapping</b> screw despite the thread created in the sheet of metal being small. Pan-head PK <b>Self-tapping</b> screws are common in electrical equipment, while flatter-headed truss or flat countersunk headed <b>self-tapping</b> screws are more common in aviation applications.|$|E
50|$|<b>Self-tapping</b> screws can {{be divided}} into two classes; those that {{displace}} material (especially plastic and thin metal sheets) without removing it are termed thread-forming <b>self-tapping</b> screws; self-tappers with sharp cutting surfaces that remove the material as they are inserted are termed self-cutting.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>self-tapping</b> screw is a screw {{that can}} tap its own hole {{as it is}} driven into the material. For hard [...] such as metal or hard plastics, the <b>self-tapping</b> ability is often created by cutting {{a gap in the}} {{continuity}} of the thread on the screw, generating a [...] and cutting edge similar to those on a tap. Thus, whereas a regular machine screw cannot tap its own hole in a metal substrate, a <b>self-tapping</b> one can (within reasonable limits of substrate hardness and depth). For softer substrates such as wood or soft plastics, the <b>self-tapping</b> ability can come simply from a tip that tapers to a gimlet point (in which no flute is needed). Like the tip of a nail or gimlet, such a point forms the hole by displacement of the surrounding material rather than any chip-forming drilling/cutting/evacuating action.|$|E

5000|$|Wall {{thickness}} of boss: Wall thicknesses for bosses {{should be less}} than 60 percent of the nominal wall to minimize sinking. However, if the boss {{is not in a}} visible area, then the wall thickness can be increased to allow for increased stresses imposed by <b>self-tapping</b> screws. It is recommended that wall {{thickness of}} boss should be around 0.6 times of nominal wall thickness depending on the material.|$|E
50|$|Sheet {{assembly}} of light aircraft is accomplished predominantly with rivets of alloys 2017-T4, 2117-T4, or 2024-T4. <b>Self-tapping</b> sheet metal screws {{are available in}} aluminum alloys, but cadmium-plated steel screws are employed more commonly to obtain higher shear strength and driveability. Alloy 2024-T4 with an anodic coating is standard for aluminum screws, bolts, and nuts made to military specifications. Alloy 6262-T9, however, is superior for nuts, because of its virtual immunity to stress-corrosion cracking.|$|E
50|$|Drywall screws heads have {{a curved}} taper, which {{allows them to}} self-pilot and install rapidly without having to be punched through the paper cover. When {{finished}} driving, these screws are recessed slightly into the drywall. Screws for light-gauge steel framing have an acute point and finely spaced threads. If the steel framing is heavier than 20-gauge, <b>self-tapping</b> screws with finely spaced threads must be used. In some applications, the drywall may {{be attached to the}} wall with adhesives.|$|E
50|$|Pocket-hole joinery, or pocket-screw joinery, {{involves}} {{drilling a hole}} at {{an angle}} — usually 15 degrees — into one workpiece, and then joining it to a second workpiece with a <b>self-tapping</b> screw. The technique, in addition to doweling, {{is said to have}} its roots in ancient Egypt, although much doubt is thrown on this theory. Older woodworking reference books never mention the technique of pocket-hole joinery and contemporary woodworking references describe it as new and nontraditional.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>self-tapping</b> screws {{are also}} self-drilling, which means that, in {{addition}} to the tap-like flute in the leading threads, there is also a preliminary drill-like fluted tip that looks much like the tip of a center drill. These screws combine a thrilling-like action and the fastener installation itself into only one driving motion (instead of separate drilling, tapping, and installing motions); they are thus very efficient in a variety of hard-substrate applications, from assembly lines to roofing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Self-tapping</b> screws {{are widely}} used for driving into sheet metal or {{plastics}} and forming their own thread. They may be either self-drilling, forming their own hole through unbroken material, or fitted into a pre-pierced hole. Self-drilling screws have some ability to cut a thread, as for a tap. Others work not by cutting, but rather by roll-forming the thread, pushing excess material {{out of the way}} by plastic deformation. This is one reason why ductile host materials, rather than brittle, are needed.|$|E
50|$|A saddle valve {{is mounted}} {{directly}} on to a pipe {{which is usually}} 1/2 inch copper tubing. Saddle valves are <b>self-tapping</b> devices. Once mounted on a line, with the included rubber seal in place, all that is required is to turn the valve clockwise until it pierces the water line. When the valve handle {{can no longer be}} turned, it is done tapping the pipe. Turning the handle counter-clockwise opens the valve. These valves can be installed without shutting off the main water supply.|$|E
50|$|The term {{is usually}} a misnomer, {{introduced}} mostly by Fender whose guitars traditionally had what is called bolt-on necks. Real bolted joints (i.e., using bolt coupled with a nut) exist—particularly in acoustic guitars—but are less common in electric guitars. However, at least one aftermarket manufacturer offers a replacement for Fender neckplates and screws that uses captive inserts—embedded in the guitar body {{by means of an}} external <b>self-tapping</b> thread — and M4 machine screws. The maker claims this permits a higher fastening torque than ordinary wood screws, and hence a better coupling between neck and body.|$|E
5000|$|The fuel inlet/fuel {{filter housing}} threads {{tend to be}} very fragile. When care is not taken to align the insert, it is {{possible}} for the fuel inlet to cross-thread and to strip when tightened in the main housing. There are several [...] "fixes" [...] available in the aftermarket: New, oversized, <b>self-tapping</b> fuel filter inserts; new fuel filter inserts that seal with O-rings; and Heli-Coil re-threading kits. In nearly all cases, the carburetor will require dis-assembly and internal cleaning of the aluminum thread residue, especially up to and including the needle and seat, (needle valve), to prevent flooding.|$|E
50|$|A {{possible}} {{distinction is}} that a screw is designed to cut its own thread; it has no need for access from or exposure {{to the opposite side}} of the component being fastened to. This definition of screw is further reinforced by the consideration of the developments of fasteners such as Tek Screws, with either round or hex heads, for roof cladding, self-drilling and <b>self-tapping</b> screws for various metal fastening applications, roof batten screws to reinforce the connection between the roof batten and the rafter, decking screws etc.On the other hand, a bolt is the male part of a fastener system designed to be accepted by a pre-equipped socket (or nut) of exactly the same thread design.|$|E
50|$|The Capelis XC-12 {{featured}} {{an unusual}} construction method {{with the main}} wing spar bolted together, {{and much of the}} metal skin attached with P-K <b>self-tapping</b> screws rather than rivets. These tended to vibrate loose, requiring tightening or replacing screws every few flights. After a 1938 emergency landing caused structural damage, promotional tours were quickly abandoned. The aircraft was then sold to RKO in 1939. The transport ended its career as a non-flying film prop, appearing in ground roles (in the 1942 Flying Tigers, starring John Wayne, and in other features) before reportedly being scrapped around 1950, after having slowly become a back lot relic. Flying shots in Five Came Back used a XC-12 miniature, due to the aircraft having been permanently grounded by the studio's insurance company.|$|E
50|$|Externally {{threaded}} inserts have threads on {{the outside}} and inside of the insert. The insert is threaded into a pre-tapped hole, or some inserts tap their own threads in a drilled or molded hole. It is then anchored by various means, such as a nylon locking element. Inserts that are anchored via Loctite are more commonly known by the trademarked name E-Z Lok. A thin walled solid bushing insert by the trademarked name TIME-SERT is locked in by rolling the bottom few internal thread into the base material with a special install driver which will permanently lock the insert in place. Key locking inserts, more commonly known by the trademarked name Keenserts, use keys that are hammered into grooves through the threads, permanently locking the insert. Inserts that are <b>self-tapping</b> and lock via friction are more commonly known by the trademarked names Tap-lok or Speedserts.|$|E
50|$|The design {{objective}} for the Model 33 was {{a machine that}} would fit into a small office space, match with other office equipment {{of the time and}} operate up to two hours per day on average. Since this machine was designed for light duty use, adjustments that Teletype made in previous teleprinters by turning screws were made by bending metal bars and levers. Many Model 33 parts were not heat treated and hardened. However, the base was die cast, but <b>self-tapping</b> screws were used, along with parts that snapped together without bolting. In another cost saving measure, the paper tape equipment was dependent on the keyboard and page printer mechanisms. Earlier Teletype machine designs, such as the Model 28 ASR, allowed the user to operate the keyboard to punch tape while transmitting a previously punched tape and to punch a tape while printing something else. Independent use of the paper tape punch and reader is not possible with the Model 33 ASR.|$|E
50|$|Typically, {{the ends}} of the rails are cleaned, aligned flat and true, and spaced apart 25 mm. This gap between rail ends for welding is to ensure {{consistent}} results in the pouring of the molten steel into the weld mold. In the event of a welding failure, the rail ends can be cropped to a 75 mm gap, removing the melted and damaged rail ends, and a new weld attempted with a special mould and larger thermite charge. A two or three piece hardened sand mould is clamped around the rail ends, and a torch of suitable heat capacity is used to preheat {{the ends of}} the rail and the interior of the mould. The proper amount of thermite with alloying metal is placed in a refractory crucible, and when the rails have reached a sufficient temperature, the thermite is ignited and allowed to react to completion (allowing time for any alloying metal to fully melt and mix, yielding the desired molten steel or alloy). The reaction crucible is then tapped at the bottom. Modern crucibles have a <b>self-tapping</b> thimble in the pouring nozzle. The molten steel flows into the mould, fusing with the rail ends and forming the weld. The slag, being lighter than the steel flows last from the crucible and overflows the mould into a steel catch basin, to be disposed of after cooling. The entire setup is allowed to cool. The mould is removed and the weld is cleaned by hot chiselling and grinding to produce a smooth joint. Typical time from start of the work until a train can run over the rail is approximately 45 minutes to more than an hour, depending on the rail size and ambient temperature. In any case, the rail steel must be cooled to less than 370 C before it can sustain the weight of rail locomotives.|$|E
30|$|<b>Self-tapping</b> screws {{of small}} sizes are {{commonly}} used in wood furniture and panel products {{on the assembly line}} or for do-it-yourself products applications. <b>Self-tapping</b> screws usually provide good holding ability and operation efficiency in wood working projects. In recent years, <b>self-tapping</b> screws, especially medium and large sizes, have drawn attention in timber engineering for connection application in Europe. They are not just an alternative fastener {{that can be used for}} timber connection. Certain requirements for current structure design and construction details need to be verified in the interest of safety. Most <b>self-tapping</b> screws can be laid out with small spacing and edge distance without the risk of splitting wood, which often happens with bolted connections. Uibel and Blaß [1] tried to identify suitable spacing and distance for <b>self-tapping</b> screws with corresponding minimum timber thickness. They further modeled a moving load during the screw-in process with factors of wood density, screw-in speed, angle between screw axis and growth ring tangent. The resulted split areas were simulated mostly by a FE model. This gave practical information about the application of <b>self-tapping</b> screws to timber construction.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{provides}} an experimental evaluation {{pertaining to the}} influence of steel <b>self-tapping</b> screw on its twisting-in specimens made of various materials and its twisting-out process. Main principles of the investigation methodology including description of  technological scheme of <b>self-tapping</b> screw electro-arc machining and specimens applied while executing the experiments and hardware measuring tools used for fixation of torque which has been applied to the <b>self-tapping</b> screw during its twisting-in in the specimen  and its twisting-out process have been presented in the paper. It has been established that the <b>self-tapping</b> screw electro-arc machining initiates formation of dimples (holes) which have solidified metal flows along their edges. The flows give a cutting ability to the screw and so they exert an influence on the conditions of screw’s interaction with the specimen during its twisting-in and twisting-out processes. The paper presents results of experimental investigations that demonstrate an impact of <b>self-tapping</b> screw electro-arc machining on its twisting-in in the specimens made of various materials and twisting-out procedure. In particular, it has been ascertained that torque value applied to the <b>self-tapping</b> screw with modified surface during twisting-in process is less in comparison with the <b>self-tapping</b> screw having an initial state of its surface {{and in the case of}} its twisting-out process the value is higher. In this respect difference between the indicated torque values is increasing when material hardness of the specimen becomes higher.   </p...|$|E
30|$|The {{structural}} glulam members fabricated with rapid-grown Japanese cedar plantation timber {{were constructed}} into a beam–girder structure with <b>self-tapping</b> screws to evaluate characteristic strength {{properties of the}} connection {{for the purpose of}} wood-framed construction application. It is suggested that <b>self-tapping</b> screws with 10  mm diameter showed better joint performance in maximum load capacity and dissipated energy than did 8  mm screw connections. <b>Self-tapping</b> screws with fully threaded shanks showed better initial stiffness on the joint than did half-threaded screw connections, but also showed less ductility. Further, both fully threaded and double-threaded sections also provided the joint with higher maximum load and better dissipated energy than did connections using screws with half-threaded shank. The nailing approach of using <b>self-tapping</b> screws is a key to influencing the structural performance of a joint. The results indicated that toe-nailing approach is superior to the face-nailing approach in the maximum load capacity, initial stiffness, and dissipated energy of a beam–girder connection. A <b>self-tapping</b> screw connection with derived allowable loading capacity for Japanese cedar glulam structure could compete as a viable bolt connection for use in wood-framed construction.|$|E
30|$|The {{characteristic}} strength properties of structural glulam connections assembled with <b>self-tapping</b> screws were examined following the ASTM testing procedure in the study. Four screw types with various numbers were designated at each connection of the beam–girder structure with different nailing schedules. The {{results indicated that}} the maximum load capacity and dissipated energy of a connection fastened with 10 -mm <b>self-tapping</b> screws were higher than those with 8 -mm screws. And, the screws with both double-threaded sections and fully threaded shanks were higher than those of single-threaded screws. An improvement on the initial stiffness of a connection was found when the number of <b>self-tapping</b> screws increased. The connections assembled with the toe-nailing approach from the beam’s bottom surface provided higher maximum loading capacity, medium initial stiffness, and a larger ductility factor, resulting in higher dissipated energy with less fragile failure. The derived allowable loading values for a beam–girder connection fastened with <b>self-tapping</b> screws using the face-nailing approach were close to the code values for bolted and pinned connections. And, a toe-nailing approach provided higher allowable loads for connections than using a face-nail approach.|$|E
30|$|The {{vertical}} withdrawal {{resistance of}} <b>self-tapping</b> screws from Japanese cedar structural glulam was also examined. The screws penetrated vertically into both the end section and width {{surface of the}} glulam member {{to a depth of}} 120  mm measured from the tip of <b>self-tapping</b> screws. Three types of screws (ST 8  ×  260, ST 10  ×  260, ST 7.5  ×  302) and two penetration directions were investigated and each testing condition had 12 replications.|$|E
40|$|Study Design: The pullout {{strength}} of a typical pedicle screw was evaluated experimentally for different screw insertion techniques. Objective: To conclude whether the <b>self-tapping</b> insertion technique is indeed the optimum one for <b>self-tapping</b> screws, {{with respect to the}} pullout strength. Summary of Background Data: It is reported in the literature that the size of the pilot-hole significantly influences the pullout {{strength of}} a <b>self-tapping</b> screw. In addition it is accepted that an optimum value of the diameter of the pilot-hole exists. For non <b>self-tapping</b> screw insertion it is reported that undertapping of the pilot-hole can increase its pullout strength. Finally it is known that in some cases orthopedic surgeons open the threaded holes, using another screw instead of a tap. Methods: A typical commercial <b>self-tapping</b> pedicle screw was inserted into blocks of Solid Rigid Polyurethane Foam (simulating osteoporotic cancellous bone), following different insertion techniques. The pullout force was measured according to the ASTM-F 543 - 02 standard. The screw was inserted into previously prepared holes of different sizes, either threaded or cylindrical, to conclude whether an optimum size of the pilot-hole exists and whether tapping can increase the pullout strength. The case where the tapping is performed using another screw was also studied. Results: For screw insertion with tapping, decreasing the outer radius of the threaded hole from 1. 00 to 0. 87 of the screw's outer radius increased the pullout force 9 %. For insertion without tapping, decreasing the pilot-hole's diameter from 0. 87 to 0. 47 of the screw's outer diameter increased its pullout force 75 %. Finally, tapping using another screw instead of a tap, gave results similar to those of conventional tapping. Conclusion: Undertapping of a pilot-hole either using a tap or another screw can increase the pullout strength of <b>self-tapping</b> pedicle screws. © 2010, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|E

Temporary fixation distal to the osteotomy is performed with a K-wire drilled through a guiding sleeve. Plate position is checked fluoroscopically. As the TomoFix is an internal fixator, precise fit to the femur is not necessary. After drilling, at least four <b>self-tapping</b> locking screws are inserted distally. Next, a bicortical <b>self-tapping</b> lag screw is inserted eccentrically in the dynamic part of the combi-hole directly superior to the osteotomy putting the osteotomy under axial compression.

30|$|To {{examine the}} {{influence}} of the number of fastened <b>self-tapping</b> screws on the strength of a connection, this study tested Japanese cedar glulam beam–girders fastened using the face-nailing approach. In general, the maximum load capacity of a connection fastened with 12 <b>self-tapping</b> screws was 11.7  % higher than that with 8 screws. Findings further showed the maximum load capacity of a connection fastened with a half-threaded shank and <b>self-tapping</b> screws had significant improvement when increasing from 8 to 12 screws, i.e., 38.6 and 63.3  % for 8 and 10  mm screws (F 8 - 260 - 12 and F 10 - 260 - 12), respectively. However, no further improvement in the maximum load capacity was found for the double-threaded and fully threaded screws as assembled from 8 to 12 screws. Some specimens fastened with 12 screws failed with a split along the glue line where screws were arranged during the assembly. It might limit the improvement of a connection through increasing number of fasteners. In the case of initial stiffness of a beam–girder connection, an improvement of 50.4  % was found when the number of <b>self-tapping</b> screws used to assemble the glulam structure was increased from 8 to 12. It also was noticed that the initial stiffness of the connection was doubled for the 8 -mm screw with double-threaded sections (FD 8 - 300 - 12). Although similar ductility was found for the connections fastened with 8 and 12 <b>self-tapping</b> screws, a 28.8  % higher dissipated energy was obtained for the connection with 12 screws.|$|E
