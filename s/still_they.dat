5|$|During this episode, {{the dogs}} had to {{interact}} with the main characters, which proved difficult. Actor Sean Bean reported that for the final scene where he has to sacrifice Lady, the animal was too scared to remain <b>still.</b> <b>They</b> had to keep rehearsing the scene until the dog felt comfortable, making a shot that should have taken a few minutes about three hours long.|$|E
5|$|These {{earliest}} tetrapods {{were not}} terrestrial. The earliest confirmed terrestrial forms are {{known from the}} early Carboniferous deposits, some 20 million years later. <b>Still,</b> <b>they</b> may have spent very brief periods out of water and would have used their legs to paw {{their way through the}} mud.|$|E
5|$|If handled {{correctly}} {{early in}} life, guinea pigs become amenable to {{being picked up}} and carried, and seldom bite or scratch. They are timid explorers and often hesitate to attempt an escape from their cage even when an opportunity presents itself. <b>Still,</b> <b>they</b> show considerable curiosity when allowed to walk freely, especially in familiar and safe terrain. Guinea pigs that become familiar with their owner will whistle on the owner's approach; they will also learn to whistle {{in response to the}} rustling of plastic bags or the opening of refrigerator doors, where their food is most commonly stored. In Switzerland, owning a single guinea pig is considered harmful to its well-being and forbidden by law.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s, they {{recorded}} with Al Green, Neil Diamond, Elvis Presley, Mike Harrison, Don Harrison Band, and Stephen <b>Stills.</b> <b>They</b> toured with <b>Stills</b> in 1971. In the 1980s, they played behind Sting and Peter Gabriel.|$|R

5|$|The {{bank has}} gained its funding from {{different}} sources, {{and the main}} contributors have shifted over time. In the initial years, donor agencies used to provide the bulk of capital at low rates. By the mid-1990s, the bank started to get most of its funding from the central bank of Bangladesh. More recently, Grameen has started bond sales {{as a source of}} finance. The bonds are implicitly subsidised, as they are guaranteed by the Government of Bangladesh, and <b>still</b> <b>they</b> are sold above the bank rate. In 2013, Bangladesh parliament passed 'Grameen Bank Act' which replaces the Grameen Bank Ordinance, 1983, authorising the government to make rules for any aspect of the running of the bank.|$|E
5|$|The most {{dangerous}} {{part of the}} operation was over by 02:15. The intruders had spent over an hour in British airspace. Now the journey back over the sea to Germany and the Netherlands was undertaken. The British had jammed German radio beacons and switched on others with the same frequency. It was hoped the move would fool German pilots into landing in Britain in error. Experienced pilots did not fall for the ruse. <b>Still,</b> <b>they</b> had to fly over the sea by dead reckoning. A consequence of this showed that while around only five Ju 88s were lost in combat over England, eight crews were missing, three were killed in crash-landings and had died from their injuries, six crews had baled out 11 aircraft crashed or were damaged on landing.|$|E
5|$|Since Alfred Eisenack first {{recognised}} {{and named}} {{the group in}} 1930, the Chitinozoa have proven incredibly useful as a stratigraphic markers in biostratigraphy during the Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian periods. Their utility {{is due to the}} rapidity of their morphological evolution, their abundance — the most productive samples bearing almost a thousand tests per gram — and the easy identification (due largely to the large variation in shapes) and short lifetimes (<10 million years) of most species. They are also widely distributed and appear in a variety of marine depositional settings, making correlation easier; better <b>still,</b> <b>they</b> can often be recognised in even quite strongly metamorphosed rocks. However, convergence of morphological form to similar environments sometimes leads to the mistaken identification of a species in several areas separated by vast differences in space and time, but sharing a similar depositional environment; clearly, this can cause major problems if the organisms are interpreted as being the same species. Aside from the acritarchs, chitinozoans were the only reliable means of correlating palæozoic units until the late 1960s, when the detailed study of conodonts and graptolites fully unleashed their stratigraphic potential.|$|E

25|$|Coral reefs occupy {{less than}} one percent of the surface area of the world oceans, but <b>still</b> <b>they</b> provide a home for 25 percent of all marine fish species. Reef {{habitats}} are a sharp contrast to the open water habitats that make up the other 99% of the world oceans.|$|E
25|$|In the Federal Republic of Germany, {{auxiliary}} {{police forces}} (Freiwilliger Polizeidienst or Sicherheitswacht) do solely {{exist in a}} few States: Baden-Württemberg, Bavaria, Hesse and Saxony. The auxiliary police (Freiwillige Polizei-Reserve (FPR)) of Berlin was dissolved in 2002. Their jurisdictions widely vary among the particular states. <b>Still</b> <b>they</b> generally exist {{for the purpose of}} crime prevention through mere presence.|$|E

25|$|The most {{significant}} loss in World War II was the deportation of the 1221 Jewish citizens to Auschwitz. The city was {{freed from the}} Nazis by the Red Army on March 28, 1945. On the next local elections in 1949, the local branch of the Communist party got only about 10% of the votes, <b>still</b> <b>they</b> became {{the leaders of the}} city.|$|E
25|$|On 19–21 February, Neptūnas {{competed in}} the newly formed Karaliaus Mindaugo taurė tournament. The team easily overcame BC Šiauliai 96–58 at the quarter-final, but was powerfully stopped at the semi-final by the {{upcoming}} champions Lietuvos rytas Vilnius 97–79. <b>Still,</b> <b>they</b> rehabilitated by winning the club's first Lithuanian Cup bronze medals after crushing Vytautas Prienai-Birštonas 88–51. Shortly after the competition, Gilvydas Biruta was replaced with Angus Brandt.|$|E
25|$|While most {{trade between}} Europe and East Asia had {{historically}} been conducted via Persian and Central Asian intermediaries, the Radhanites {{were among the}} first to establish a trade network that stretched from Western Europe to Eastern Asia. More remarkable <b>still,</b> <b>they</b> engaged in this trade regularly and over an extended period of time, centuries before Marco Polo and ibn Battuta brought their tales of travel in the Orient to the Christians and the Muslims, respectively. Indeed, ibn Battuta is believed to have traveled with the Muslim traders who traveled to the Orient on routes similar to those used by the Radhanites.|$|E

25|$|Logistics, nonetheless, {{were very}} bad for both armies, {{supported}} by whatever equipment was left over from World War I or could be captured. The Polish Army, for example, employed guns made in five countries, and rifles manufactured in six, each using different ammunition. The Soviets had many military depots at their disposal, left by withdrawing German armies in 1918–19, and modern French armaments captured in great numbers from the White Russians and the Allied expeditionary forces in the Russian Civil War. <b>Still,</b> <b>they</b> suffered a shortage of arms; both the Red Army and the Polish forces were grossly underequipped by Western standards.|$|E
25|$|Apollo was {{commissioned}} in July 1805 under Captain Edward Fellowes, who sailed {{her for the}} Mediterranean on 26 January 1806. In 1806 she operated off southern Italy. On 5 June boats from Apollo brought out a French brig near Agie Finucana, in the Gulf of Taranto, where she had run aground. The brig was transporting six 24-pounder guns, together with their carriages. The cutting out party had {{to work through the}} night under small-arms fire from the shore, as well as fire from a field piece. <b>Still,</b> <b>they</b> managed to retrieve the vessel while suffering only one man wounded. The guns were intended for a new battery opposite the lighthouse.|$|E
25|$|As {{military}} {{size and}} costs increased, new taxes were introduced or existing tax laws reformed {{in the late}} Empire to finance it, even though more inhabitants were available within {{the borders of the}} late Empire, reducing the per capita costs for an increased standing army was impractical. A large number of the population could not be taxed because they were slaves or held Roman citizenship, both of which exempted them from taxation. Of the remaining, a large number were already impoverished by centuries of warfare and weakened by chronic malnutrition. <b>Still,</b> <b>they</b> had to handle an increasing tax rate and so they often abandoned their lands to survive in a city.|$|E

25|$|Slave {{characters}} in general {{came to be}} low-comedy types with names that matched the instruments they played: Brudder Tambo (or simply Tambo) for the tambourine and Brudder Bones (or Bones) for the bone castanets or bones. These endmen (for {{their position in the}} minstrel semicircle) were ignorant and poorly spoken, being conned, electrocuted, or run over in various sketches. They happily shared their stupidity; one slave character said that to get to China, one had only to go up in a balloon and wait for the world to rotate below. Highly musical and unable to sit <b>still,</b> <b>they</b> constantly contorted their bodies wildly while singing.|$|E
25|$|In the off-season, the Kings made few {{adjustments}} to their roster by trading Macapagal to Coca Cola for guard Chris Pacana and Chia to Talk 'N Text for veteran Vic Pablo. They also boosted their backcourt by drafting Macky Escalona from Ateneo and acquiring Paul Artadi from Air21 after being traded by Purefoods. They also added depth by getting Willy Wilson. <b>Still,</b> <b>they</b> lacked interior presence {{due to the}} loss of Hatfield and injuries to Rafi Reavis and Billy Mamaril. Despite having Helterbrand back in the lineup, they have yet returned to their competitive form because Caguioa got injured. They won the opening game against Red Bull but finished the eliminations 8–10. They ended up in the wildcard phase where they met Air21 and lose 119–110, ending its title defense.|$|E
25|$|Evelyn Baldwin, {{sponsored}} by William Ziegler, organized the Ziegler Polar Expedition of 1901. Setting up a base on Alger Island, he stayed the winter exploring the area, {{but failed to}} press northwards. The expedition was largely regarded as an utter failure by the exploration and scientific community, which cited the lack of proper management. Unhappy with the outcome, Ziegler organized a new expedition, for which he appointed Anthony Fiala, second-in-command in the first expedition, as leader. It arrived in 1903 and spent the winter. Their ship, America, was crushed beyond repair in December and disappeared in January. <b>Still,</b> <b>they</b> made two attempts towards the pole, {{both of which were}} quickly abandoned. They were forced to stay another year, making yet another unsuccessful attempt at the pole, before being evacuated in 1905 by the Terra Nova.|$|E
