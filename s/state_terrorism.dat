5|$|In December 1829, Rosas became {{governor}} of the province of Buenos Aires and established a dictatorship backed by <b>state</b> <b>terrorism.</b> In 1831, he signed the Federal Pact, recognising provincial autonomy and creating the Argentine Confederation. When his term of office ended in 1832, Rosas departed to the frontier to wage war on the indigenous peoples. After his supporters launched a coup in Buenos Aires, Rosas was asked to return and once again took office as governor. Rosas reestablished his dictatorship and formed the repressive Mazorca, an armed parapolice that killed thousands of citizens. Elections became a farce, and the legislature and judiciary became docile instruments of his will. Rosas created a cult of personality and his regime became totalitarian in nature, with all aspects of society rigidly controlled.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to purges, banishments and censorship, Rosas took measures against {{the opposition and}} anyone else he deemed a threat that historians have considered <b>state</b> <b>terrorism.</b> Terror was a tool used to intimidate dissident voices, to shore up support among his own partisans and to exterminate his foes. His targets were denounced, sometimes inaccurately, as having ties to Unitarians. Those victimised included members of his government and party who were suspected of being insufficiently loyal. If actual opponents were not at hand, the regime found other targets that were punished to make an example. A climate of fear was used to create unquestioning conformity to Rosas' dictates.|$|E
5|$|Unrest {{then broke}} out across eastern Bolivia, as radicalized autonomist activists {{established}} blockades, occupied airports, clashing with pro-government demonstrations, police, and armed forces. Some formed paramilitaries, bombing state companies, indigenous NGOs, {{and human rights}} organisations, also launching armed racist attacks on indigenous communities, culminating in the Pando Massacre of MAS activists. The autonomists gained support from some high-ranking politicians; Santa Cruz Governor Rubén Costas lambasted Morales and his supporters with racist epithets, accusing the president of being an Aymara fundamentalist and a totalitarian dictator responsible for <b>state</b> <b>terrorism.</b> Amid the unrest, foreign commentators began speculating {{on the possibility of}} civil war.|$|E

5|$|In Chile, the Socialist Party {{candidate}} Salvador Allende won {{the presidential}} election of 1970, becoming the first democratically elected Marxist {{to become president of}} a country in the Americas. The CIA targeted Allende for removal and operated to undermine his support domestically, which contributed to a period of unrest culminating in General Augusto Pinochet's coup d'état on 11 September 1973. Pinochet consolidated power as a military dictator, Allende's reforms of the economy were rolled back, and leftist opponents were killed or detained in internment camps under the Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional (DINA). The Pinochet regime would go on {{to be one of the}} leading participants in Operation Condor, an international campaign of political assassination and <b>state</b> <b>terrorism</b> organized by right-wing military dictatorships in the Southern Cone of South America that was covertly supported by the US government.|$|E

25|$|Relations between France and New Zealand were {{strained}} for {{two short}} periods in the 1980s and 1990s over the French nuclear tests at Moruroa and {{the bombing of}} the Rainbow Warrior in Auckland harbour.

25|$|The {{dictatorship}} {{conducted the}} Dirty War against the political opposition, killing and injuring {{tens of thousands}} of political opponents and distantly related suspects in terrorist disappearances, kidnappings and tortures. In 1982 it was defeated in the Falklands War, which further damaged its popular support. Finally the junta allowed return to democracy with elections in 1983.

25|$|Supporters of {{the bombings}} {{generally}} assert that they caused the Japanese surrender, preventing massive casualties {{on both sides}} in the planned invasion of Japan: Kyūshū was to be invaded in October 1945 and Honshū five months later. It was thought Japan would not surrender unless there was an overwhelming demonstration of destructive capability. Those who oppose the bombings argue it was militarily unnecessary, inherently immoral, a war crime, or a form of <b>state</b> <b>terrorism.</b> Critics believe a naval blockade and conventional bombings would have forced Japan to surrender unconditionally. Some critics believe Japan was more motivated to surrender by the Soviet Union's invasion of Manchuria and other Japanese-held areas.|$|E

25|$|The ULFA is {{a revolutionary}} {{political}} organisation {{engaged in a}} liberation struggle against <b>state</b> <b>terrorism</b> and economic exploitation by India {{for the establishment of}} a sovereign, independent Assam for the Indigenous Assamese people. It does not consider itself a secessionist organisation, as it claims that Assam was never a part of India and as a matter of fact the Treaty of Yandaboo was signed in 1826 by General Sir Archibald Campbell on the British side, and by Governor of Legaing Maha Min Hla Kyaw Htin from the Burmese side. With the British army at Yandabo village, only 50 miles from the capital Ava, the Burmese were forced to accept the British terms without discussion.|$|E
25|$|Unlike war crimes, {{crimes against}} {{humanity}} can be committed during peace or war. They are not isolated or sporadic events, but are part either of a government policy (although the perpetrators need not identify themselves with this policy) or of a wide practice of atrocities tolerated or condoned by a government or a de facto authority. War crimes, murder, massacres, dehumanization, genocide, ethnic cleansing, deportations, unethical human experimentation, extrajudicial punishments including summary executions, use of WMDs, <b>state</b> <b>terrorism</b> or state sponsoring of terrorism, death squads, kidnappings and forced disappearances, military use of children, unjust imprisonment, enslavement, cannibalism, torture, rape, and political, racial, or religious repression may reach the threshold of {{crimes against humanity}} if {{they are part of}} a widespread or systematic practice.|$|E
25|$|Voigt was {{described}} by his former tutor in 1919 as “a first-rate and rather old-fashioned liberal”, and, as befitted the German Correspondent of a left-leaning liberal, if non-partisan, newspaper, Voigt was a champion of individual liberty and democracy. He worked closely with many on the left of German and Eastern European politics in the 1920s and 1930s, was {{a supporter of the}} Weimar Republic and broadly opposed to the post-war peace settlement, which he regarded as unfair and too harsh. He was a staunch and implacable opponent of injustice and the use of coercion and <b>state</b> <b>terrorism,</b> a crusading journalist determined to expose the cruelty and injustice meted out to the oppressed peoples and minorities of Central and Eastern Europe. He was also sceptical about the ability of the League of Nations to solve international disputes.|$|E

500|$|<b>State</b> <b>terrorism</b> {{was carried}} out by the Mazorca, an armed parapolice unit of the Sociedad Popular Restauradora {{political}} organization. The Sociedad Popular Restauradora and the Mazorca were creations of Rosas, who retained tight control over both. The tactics of the mazorqueros included neighborhood sweeps in which houses would be searched and occupants intimidated. Others who fell into their power were arrested, tortured and killed. Killings were generally by shooting, lance-thrusting or throat-slitting. Many were castrated, or had their beards scalped or their tongues cut out. [...] Modern estimates report around 2,000 people were killed from 1829 until 1852.|$|E
500|$|Although Kirchner repudiated the {{military}} forces {{who participated in}} the Dirty War, he overlooked the guerrilla movements of the time. The government ignored the 30th anniversary of the ERP attack on the tank regiment in Azul and the 15th anniversary of the 1989 attack on La Tablada barracks. According to Rosendo Fraga, Kirchner downplayed the presence of terrorist organizations during the Dirty War. Guerrillas who committed suicide or who were executed by their own organizations were re-categorized in 2006 as victims of <b>state</b> <b>terrorism,</b> and their survivors were compensated by the state. However, victims of the guerrillas were not compensated. Journalist Ceferino Reato said that the Kirchners sought to replace the theory of the two demons, which blamed the Dirty War on both {{the military}} and the guerrillas, with a [...] "theory of angels and demons", which blamed only the military.|$|E
