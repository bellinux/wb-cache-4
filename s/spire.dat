5|$|In 1724 the 14th century <b>spire</b> of the Church of the Holy Ghost in Crowcombe {{was damaged}} by a {{lightning}} strike. The top {{section of the}} <b>spire</b> was removed and is now planted in the churchyard, and stone from the <b>spire</b> {{was used in the}} flooring of the church. Inside the church, carved bench-ends dating from 1534 depict such pagan subjects as the Green Man and the legend of the men of Crowcombe fighting a two-headed dragon.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} quarter of 2006, Shelbourne Development issued two {{separate}} press releases regarding the construction and design of the <b>spire.</b> A November 2006 press release stated that construction of the Chicago <b>Spire</b> would begin in June 2007. In early December 2006, Shelbourne Development issued another press release stating that {{the design of the}} building had been revised. This included the removal of the hotel and the antenna mast, making the building consist solely of condominium units. The design change altered the twist to be consolidated towards the base of the building, which was also wider than the original plan. Additionally, the <b>spire</b> no longer tapered at the top, resulting in an increase in floor space and overall floor count. The revision also removed the separate parking structure from the original plan, instead incorporating underground parking into the <b>spire</b> itself. This first major redesign of the Chicago <b>Spire</b> was criticized by architectural critics and city officials.|$|E
5|$|St Denys' Church, Sleaford, is {{a medieval}} parish church in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, England. While {{a church and}} a priest {{are likely to have}} been present in the {{settlement}} since approximately 1086, the oldest parts of the present building are the tower and <b>spire.</b> The tower and <b>spire</b> can be dated to the late 12th and early 13th centuries; the stone broach <b>spire</b> is one of the earliest examples of its kind in England. The Decorated Gothic nave, aisles and north transept were built in the 14th century. The church was altered in the 19th century: the north aisle was rebuilt by the local builders Kirk and Parry in 1853 and the tower and <b>spire</b> were largely rebuilt in 1884 after being struck by lightning. St Denys' remains in use for worship by the Church of England.|$|E
5|$|At the September 2008 {{topping off}} ceremony, Donald Trump marketed his hotel by expressing {{doubts about the}} Chicago <b>Spire</b> ever being {{completed}} due to the financial crisis of 2007–2009.

5|$|Many of Daniel Libeskind's {{original}} concepts {{from the}} 2002 competition were discarded from the tower's final design. One World Trade Center's final design consisted of simple symmetries {{and a more}} traditional profile, intended to compare with selected elements of the contemporary New York skyline. The tower's central <b>spire</b> draws from previous buildings, such as the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. It also visually resembles the original Twin Towers, rather than being an off-center <b>spire</b> similar to the Statue of Liberty.|$|E
5|$|The Chicago <b>Spire</b> was a supertall {{skyscraper}} {{project at}} 400 N. Lake Shore Drive in Chicago, Illinois that failed financially after beginning construction. When originally proposed as the Fordham <b>Spire</b> in July 2005, the design had 116 stories {{and would have}} included a hotel and condominiums and been topped with a broadcast antenna mast. The design was by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, and Chicago developer Christopher T. Carley of the Fordham Company was spearheading the project. On 16 March 2006, the initial design of the building passed unanimously during that day's meeting of the Chicago Plan Commission. A court ruling on 4 November 2014 brought to a close the original development plan and the extended litigation over the nine-year-old project; developer Garrett Kelleher signed over the property location to the project's biggest creditor, Related Midwest, who announced {{that they would not}} build the <b>Spire.</b>|$|E
