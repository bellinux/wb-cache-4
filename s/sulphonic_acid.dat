Using known techniques, the membranes are made from homogeneous solutions comprising between 5 and 30 per cent PVDF by weight and between 0. 01 and 30 per cent <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acids</b> and/or their salts by weight; these salts are obtained by sulphonating the polyether ketones of formula (I) or by subsequent neutralization of the <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acids.</b> The membranes are then treated with methanolic solutions comprising between 0. 1 and 5 per cent of the above-mentioned <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acids</b> and/or their salts by weight.

40|$|Isolated lignins, {{obtained}} by extraction with formic and acetic acids, which are normally insoluble in aqueous bisulphite solution, {{have been shown}} to yield water-soluble lignin <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acids</b> after a prior treatment of the lignin with ozone. The alkaline cleavage of these lignin <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acids</b> has given rise to vanillin and acetovanillone, both of which have hitherto evaded isolation from these lignins. The use of formic acid as an ozonization solvent has been developed, and its characteristics in this capacity demonstrated by experiments on organic compounds of known structure. For the first time direct chemical evidence has been demonstrated for the presence of a carbonyl group in the solubilization of lignin by aqueous bisulphites. A study of various lignins has produced evidence to show that the carbonyl group is associated with an hydroxyl group and that the presence of both these groups is necessary for the formation of lignin <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acids.</b> A new interpretation of the process of delignification by means of aqueous bisulphite solution has been postulated in view of these new experimental findings...|$|R

It can also be produced by alkaline hydrolysis of polychlorinatedbenzenes at high temperature and pressure, by conversion of diazonium salts of chlorinated anilines, or by chlorination of phenolsulphonic acids and benzenesulphonic acids followed by removal of the <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> group. The hydrolysis of HCP gives chloranil.|$|E

Phosphate acid halides {{have been used}} to introduce phosphate groups into lead structures. Structures containing hydroxy groups have been introduced by reaction of the corresponding monochlorinated hydrin and the use of suitable epoxides amongst other methods. <b>Sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> groups may be introduced by either direct sulfonation or the addition of bisulfite to reactive C = C bonds amongst other methods.|$|E

A {{sulfonic acid}} {{can be thought of as}} sulfuric acid with one hydroxyl group replaced by an organic substituent. The parent compound (with the organic substituent replaced by hydrogen) is the hypothetical compound sulfurous acid. Salts or esters of sulfonic acids are called sulfonates.|$|E

50|$|This effect {{comes as}} a result of two {{similarly}} charged particles, one from the resin and one from the solution, failing to distribute properly between the two sides; there is a selective uptake of one ion over another. For example, in a sulphonated polystyrene resin, a cation exchange resin, the chlorine ion of a hydrochloric acid buffer should equilibrate into the resin. However, since the concentration of the <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> in the resin is high, the hydrogen of HCl has no tendency to enter the column. This, combined with the need of electroneutrality, leads to a minimum amount of hydrogen and chlorine entering the resin.|$|E
50|$|To mimic colitis and {{activate}} inflammatory T {{cells in}} an experimental condition, wild-type mice {{were treated with}} trinitrobenzen <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (TNBS). Thereafter, these mice were given PSA orally. Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (IL-17a and TNFα) in CD4+ cells was measured with ELISA. The researchers found that compared to the CD4+ cells in the control mice, CD4+ cells in PSA-treated mice produced reduced levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17a and TNFα. Furthermore, after intestinal colonization with B. fragilis, IL-23 expression by splenocytes was markedly reduced. These data suggest that PSA secreted by Bacteroides fragilis suppresses the inflammatory process during colitis by leading to increased production of IL-10 and decreased production of IL-17, TNFα, and IL-23.|$|E
5000|$|Physicochemical {{methods are}} based on the use of coagulants and {{adsorbents}} [...] Coagulants promote the coarsening and precipitation of fine-dispersed asphalt-resinous substances in oil. Adsorbents selectively absorb organic and inorganic compounds. These methods remove asphalt and resinous compounds, emulsified and dissolved water from oil. Adsorptive treatment with bleaching clays neutralizes free acid in acid-treated oil, unstable oxidized and sulphurized products as well as traces of <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid.</b> In addition, clay treatment leads to higher resistance to oil oxidation at high temperatures and increased colour stability. This process is used in clay polishing plants for waste oil re-refining and transformer oil regeneration systems for the reclamation of old transformer oil to as-new condition.|$|E

Final results concluded that exhaustion (%E) of the dyes on wool fibers {{increased with decreasing}} pH of application and that fixation (%F) of the dyes on wool fibers increased with increasing pH of application and the highest total fixation efficiency was achieved at pH 5.

5000|$|Some organic UV filters under UV {{radiation}} {{can generate}} reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) (OH, H2O2) (e.g. BP-3, octocrylene (OCR), OMC, phenylbenzimidazole <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> (PBS), PABA, etc.).The levels of H2O2 in waters of Mediterranean beach reached 270 nM/day {{as a result}} of Sunscreens. H2O2 as an oxidizing specie is responsible of damaging lipids, proteins and DNA and generating high stress levels in marine organisms. Inorganic UV-filters (i.e. TiO2) can also generate ROS, which is toxic for the marine phytoplankton [...]The toxicity of nano-TiO2 is due to its photochemical properties under solar radiation that depend on the radiation intensity, the crystalline structure and the concentration of the nanoparticles. In addition, the inert coating layer of the nanoparticles which protects against photoreactivity is dissolved in aquatic environments after being released from sunscreens.|$|E
50|$|Pauly {{published}} 71 {{papers on}} organic chemistry and physiological chemistry and filed at least 14 patents related to pharmaceutical products, fragrances and antiseptic preparations. He correctly confirmed {{the finding of}} Thomas Aldrich that the formula for adrenaline was C9H13NO3 {{despite the fact that}} he was not working with pure samples, which only emerged much later. Pauly spent many years studying the diazo-reactions of proteins. In 1904 he published a paper that described what became known as the Pauly reaction, a method of detecting the presence of the amino acids tyrosine or histidine in proteins. In 1915 Pauly used diazo-benzene arsinic acid rather than diazo-benzene <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> to prepare an insoluble diazo-compound. He found that a tyrosine ring took on two molecules of the diazo-compound to form a bis-diazo-tyrosine. A histidine ring did the same. These discoveries proved invaluable to the work of Karl Landsteiner on immunity and allergy.|$|E
50|$|The {{design by}} Wilson had {{elements}} of both the Mark I and the Whippet: a similar but smaller tracked rhomboid chassis of the former and fixed turret like the latter. A novel feature was the separate compartment in the back, housing the 100 hp (75 kW) engine (a four-cylinder shortened Ricardo design) and behind it the epicyclic transmission. Two fuel tanks at the back held 85 imperial gallons (386 L) of petrol. Other innovations were the ability to lay a smoke screen {{and the use of}} sloped armour {{in the front of the}} hull. The smoke screen device consisted of a <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> reservoir located over the exhaust pipe. Armament consisted of a maximum of five machine guns in the superstructure and two in the side doors. These hull doors looked a bit like miniature sponsons. The machine guns were removable and in practice fewer guns would have been taken along, the machine-gunner moving his gun when switching position; most sources give an estimate of four.|$|E

Ceric methane sulphonate was prepared as homogeneous solution as well as yellow crystalline solid in 2 M methane <b>sulphonic</b> <b>acid</b> under optimized conditions.
