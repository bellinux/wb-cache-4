In the 1950s methods of adjusting bomb yield were in their infancy and considerable thought was given to providing a means of swapping out a <b>standard</b> <b>yield</b> bomb for a smaller yield one in a 2 or 3 second time frame or to provide an alternative means of firing low yield bombs.

5000|$|Purification steps always {{lower the}} yield, through losses {{incurred}} during {{the transfer of}} material between reaction vessels and purification apparatus or imperfect separation of the product from impurities, which may necessitate the discarding of fractions deemed insufficiently pure. The yield of the product measured after purification (typically to >95% spectroscopic purity, or to sufficient purity to pass combustion analysis) is called the isolated yield of the reaction. Yields can also be calculated by measuring the amount of product formed (typically in the crude, unpurified product) relative to a known amount of an added internal standard, using techniques like gas / liquid chromatography, or NMR spectroscopy. A yield determined using this approach is known as an internal <b>standard</b> <b>yield.</b> Yields are typically obtained in this manner to accurately determine the quantity of product produced by a reaction, irrespective of potential isolation problems. Additionally, they can be useful when isolation of the product is challenging or tedious, or when the rapid determination of an approximate yield is desired. Unless otherwise indicated, yields reported in the synthetic organic and inorganic chemistry literature refer to isolated yields, which better reflect the amount of pure product one is likely to obtain under the reported conditions, upon repeating the experimental procedure.|$|E

Plasma and urine nicotine concentrations, carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) concentration, puffing behaviour, 24 -hour cigarette consumption, and butt nicotine content were measured. The changes in plasma nicotine and blood COHb concentrations showed that the smokers compensated for about two-thirds of the difference in standard yields when switched to either high- or low-nicotine cigarettes. Thus, compared with the medium-nicotine brand, the intake of nicotine and carbon monoxide was only about 10 % higher when subjects smoked the high-nicotine cigarettes, which had a <b>standard</b> <b>yield</b> 30 - 40 % higher than the medium brands; and only about 15 % lower when they smoked the low-nicotine cigarettes, which had a <b>standard</b> <b>yield</b> about 50 % lower than the medium brands.

40|$|When {{a society}} wants to control {{aggregate}} emission under a certain target level, {{is it more}} desirable to impose a tax or a regulatory standard on emission? To answer this question, we explore a model where plants are heterogeneous in productivity and monopolistically competitive {{in the production of}} a set of varieties of (dirty-) goods whose by-product is emission. The main result is that the <b>standard</b> <b>yields</b> higher welfare than the tax if and only if productivity dispersion is small and the monopoly power in the dirty-goods sector is strong. In the process of obtaining this result, we find that, if the plants have no access to an abatement technology, then the tax dominates the standard unambiguously. When the plants do have access to an abatement technology, there can be less price distortion under the standard than under the tax, in which case the <b>standard</b> can <b>yield</b> higher welfare.
