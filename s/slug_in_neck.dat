40|$|Slug (Snail 2) is {{a member}} of the Snail family of zinc-finger {{transcription}} factors with regulatory functions in development, tissue morphogenesis, and tumor progression. Little is known about <b>Slug</b> <b>in</b> normal adult tissue; however, a role for <b>Slug</b> <b>in</b> the skin was suggested by our previous observations of <b>Slug</b> expression <b>in</b> normal murine keratinocytes and Slug induction at wound margins. To study the impact of <b>Slug</b> <b>in</b> the skin, we compared patterns of gene expression in epidermis from Slug-null and wild-type mice. A total of 139 genes had significantly increased, and 109 genes had significantly decreased expression <b>in</b> <b>Slug</b> knockout epidermis. Altered expression of selected genes <b>in</b> <b>Slug</b> knockout epidermis was validated by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. Previously reported Slug targets were identified, in addition to novel genes, including cytokeratins, adhesion molecules, and extracellular matrix components. Functional classification of altered gene expression was consistent with a role for <b>Slug</b> <b>in</b> keratinocyte development and differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, motility, as well as angiogenesis and response to environmental stimuli. These results highlight the utility of genetic models to study the in vivo impact of regulatory factors in unperturbed skin and suggest that Slug has significant activities in the adult epidermis...|$|R

Sir Kay sets out to find food for his wearied king, and barges in on a manor near the castle of the Lord of Meyloant/Meliolant. He finds a dwarf roasting a peacock, and asks [...] "Are there any persons about?" [...] (as if a dwarf is not a human being). Ignored, Kay holds back his compulsion to kill the dwarf on the spot, and now says, in effect, that [...] "Since such a lovely bird as this is a mismatch for a humnchbacked dwarf, I shall have it for dinner." [...] The angered dwarf now tells him to leave or suffer the consequences. Kay hurls the dwarf to a pillar supporting the chimney, when {{the lord of the}} manor makes entrance. The lord asks what is going on, and Kay is characteristically rude. So the lord declares [...] "It is not in the habit of my family to refuse food to anyone who asks," [...] and he grabs the peacock (probably by its spit) and <b>slugs</b> Kay <b>in</b> the <b>neck,</b> leaving him with an indelible burn mark. Kay reports back to Arthur of his failure, and the courteous Gawain is sent. The lord of the manor (named Yder li biaus or [...] "Yder the Fair") is impressed and gives Arthur and his men a cordial invitation to his manor. (Potvin ed.

40|$|Purpose: In a {{previous}} genome-wide gene expression profiling analysis using an invasion cancer cell lines model, {{we have identified}} Slug as selectively overexpressed in the highly invasive cancer cells. Here, we investigated the clinical significance of <b>Slug</b> <b>in</b> lung adenocarcinoma {{and the role of}} <b>Slug</b> <b>in</b> the process of cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Experimental Design: Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was used to investigate <b>Slug</b> mRNA <b>in</b> surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma of 54 patients and its correlation with survival. We overexpressed <b>Slug</b> <b>in</b> a lung adenocarcinoma cell line with very low Slug levels and investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects of Slug expression. Results: High expression of <b>Slug</b> mRNA <b>in</b> lung cancer tissue was significantly associated with postoperative relapse (P = 0. 03) and shorter patient survival (P < 0. 001). The overexpression of Slug enhanced xenograft tumor growth and increased microvessel counts in angiogenesis assay. Both inducible and constitutive overexpression of Slug suppressed the expression of E-cadherin and increased the in vitro invasive ability. Zymography revealed increased matrix metalloproteinase- 2 activity <b>in</b> <b>Slug</b> overexpressed cells. ELISA, reverse transcription-PCR, and immunohistochemistry confirmed the increase of matrix metalloproteinase- 2 proteins and mRNA <b>in</b> <b>Slug</b> overexpressed cells and xenograft tumors. Conclusions: Slug expression can predict the clinical outcome of lung adenocarcinoma patients. Slug is a novel invasion-promoting gene in lung adenocarcinoma...|$|R
