40|$|This {{dissertation}} inquires {{into the}} relationship between income, aspirations, and life satisfaction in post-transition Russia. It first explores the channels through which adaptation and social comparison contribute to higher income aspirations. The results show that social comparison is a strong agent in shaping aspirations, while the effect of adaptation is relatively weak. Subsequently, the dissertation tests for the effect of aspirations on two separate satisfaction indices, satisfaction with life and satisfaction with economic conditions. This dissertation uses a Chamberlain random-effects ordered probit estimation to control for time-invariant unobservable individual traits. In contrast to previous studies, {{the results suggest that}} increases in aspirations {{have a positive effect on}} life satisfaction. This dissertation argues that this is caused by the expectations contained in income aspirations. Higher aspirations reflect an increase in needs commensurate to changes in own and others' income, but they also reflect improved income expectations based on the information provided by the present income of relevant others. The improved outlook embedded in the higher income aspirations causes the latter to have a positive effect on life satisfaction. This suggests that, ten years into the transition process, the reaction patterns of life satisfaction in Russia differ substantially from those in developed countries. While the relationship between life satisfaction and income or institutions has recently received a lot attention, the relationship between life satisfaction and accumulated wealth remains unexplored. This dissertation makes use of the 2008 Gallup World Poll and a novel wealth database compiled by the World Bank to evaluate the effect of wealth, produced capital, and natural resources on life satisfaction. The dissertation finds that both produced capital and natural capital have a positive effect on life satisfaction. The effect of good institutions and informal safety nets is also positive. However, in results that parallel findings from the resource curse literature, this dissertation shows that the positive effect of natural capital is due to diffuse natural resources like cropland, pastureland and forestry. <b>Subsoil</b> <b>asset</b> wealth has no significant effect on life satisfaction. Blood feuds represent a significant challenge to law enforcement, institutional consolidation and economic development due to the violence they generate and the other forms of crime they contribute to. This paper seeks to model and explain the decision making dynamics behind blood feuds. Rather than a simple retaliatory act, the violence associated with blood feuds is very much an integral aspect of an institutional framework that reflects a different set of ecological conditions and preferences. This paper incorporates different cultural and ecological aspects of various societies into a theoretical model that explains how blood feuds are sustained in a society. In addition, the model developed in this paper helps explain the longevity of blood feuds and reconcile different views from the anthropology literature...|$|R

40|$|Brunnschweiler and Bulte (2008) [1, 2] provide {{cross-country}} {{evidence that}} resource curse is a "red herring" once one corrects for endogeneity of resource exports and allows resource abundance to affect growth. Their {{results show that}} resource exports are no longer significant while value of <b>subsoil</b> <b>assets</b> has a significant positive effect on growth. But the World Bank measure of <b>subsoil</b> <b>assets</b> is proportional to current rents, and thus is also endogenous. Furthermore, their results suffer from an unfortunate data mishap, omitted variables bias, weakness of instruments, violation of exclusion restrictions and misspecification error. Correcting for these issues and instrumenting resource exports with values of proven reserves {{at the beginning of}} the sample period, there is no evidence for resource curse either and <b>subsoil</b> <b>assets</b> are no longer significant. However, the same evidence suggests that resource exports or rents boost growth in stable countries, but also make especially already volatile countries more volatile and thus indirectly worsen growth prospects.

These effects are particularly significant in countries with a comparatively lower institutional quality.

40|$|A new and {{extensive}} panel of outward {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI) at the sector level is used to estimate the determinants of non-resource and resource FDI. Since FDI is I(1), we estimate panel error-correction models of FDI with spatial lags for FDI and market potential. Our main result is that <b>subsoil</b> <b>assets</b> boost resource FDI, but crowd out non-resource FDI. The effect on non-resource FDI dominates, so that aggregate FDI is less in resource-rich countries. Spatial lags aggravate this crowding out of non-resource FDI. In addition, we find that (i) resource FDI is mainly vertical whereas other FDI is of the export-fragmentation variety; (ii) trade openness, free trade agreements and institutional quality do not impact non-resource FDI but institutional quality does {{have a positive effect on}} resource FDI; and (iii) the short-run dynamics comes mostly from shocks to FDI itself. Our main and ancillary results are robust to different measures of resource reserves and the oil price and to allowing for sample selection bias. co-integration tests; external margin; hydrocarbon reserves; outward sector level FDI; sample selection bias; spatial econometrics; <b>subsoil</b> <b>assets...</b>|$|E

This provides a means for the commercial depletion of <b>subsoil</b> <b>assets</b> to be set against national income. The results for 1981 to 2000 are presented in Oil and gas monetary balance sheet Since observed market values for transactions in the assets in situ are not widely available, the present value method is used to put a monetary value on the physical stocks of assets. This is an indirect valuation method measuring the current value of the asset's future streams of income by discounting the expected future rent, {{often referred to as the}} economic rent or resource rent. The method relies on information about the size of resource rent, the number of years for which the rent is to be received and the social discount rate to be applied. The resource rent is the net income from extraction defined as total revenue from sales less all costs incurred in the extraction process i. e. operating costs, depreciation of capital and allowances for decommissioning costs and the return on capital. The rate of return on capital is estimated to be 8 % in real terms, in line with Eurostat recommendations 1, but it is worth noting that the resulting valuations ar...|$|E
40|$|Abstract OnlyThe World Bank has {{constructed}} wealth {{accounts for}} nearly 15 years, {{most recently in}} The Changing Wealth of Nations. The accounts include produced capital, natural capital and human and social capital. Natural capital includes agricultural land, forests, <b>subsoil</b> <b>assets</b> and protected areas, but omit a number of critical natural capital stocks, {{one of which is}} fisheries. This omission reflects the lack of readily available data for fisheries accounts at the country level for most, if not all countries in the world. In general, fisheries and aquatic resources are poorly represented in most national environmental accounting efforts. In a recent review of natural capital accounting in The Changing Wealth of Nations, only a few countries, i. e., New Zealand, Iceland and Norway, construct monetary asset accounts for fisheries on a regular basis. We attempt to fill this gap in this contribution...|$|E
40|$|More than 10  years since a {{practical}} linkage between sustainable development and {{a measure of}} national wealth—expanded to include natural and environmental resources—was first posited, the empirical estimation of adjusted net savings, dubbed ‘genuine’ saving, has evolved considerably. In this paper we take stock of both progress achieved and the challenges that remain. We begin by recalling the key points made in Pearce and Atkinson (1993, Ecol Econ 8, 103), which presented the first cross-country estimates of savings rates adjusted to reflect depletion and degradation of the environment. We then briefly summarise {{the evolution of the}} theoretical argument linking savings and sustainability. However, the main focus of this paper is an aspect that concerned David Pearce greatly, namely the evolution of the measurement of genuine savings. We identify and consider the empirical evidence with regard to two particular measurement issues: the valuation of exhaustible resources and environmental degradation. Common to the both issues are concerns about measuring changes in national wealth in real world economies.
