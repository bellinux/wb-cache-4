40|$|The oyster culture, flourishing {{along the}} Belgian coast at the {{beginning}} of the century, perished entirely in the course of two World Wars. In 1956, it was taken on again intensively in the <b>Scour</b> <b>Basin</b> of Ostend. If we consider the obtained results with the affination of Flat and Portuguese oyster, this 86 ha closed basin, is of an exceptional productivity. Essays on the understanding of the origin of calcified oysters, done from 1960 until 1966, turned out to be very promising and an integral oyster culture from the larvae up to the adult oyster could be observed. In any case the last few years, eventhough compared to before a normal emission of larvae of Ostrea edulis, there has not been a fixation of the origin. Regular samples of plankton, effected from June until August, in 1969 and in 1970, revealed that the offspring of the Flat Oyster showed no growing, while the larvae of other bivalve species in the Scour Bassin, like Mytilus, Mya and Cardium, grew normally. Experiences of artificial oyster cultures in laboratory, effected in 1969 and in 1970, showed the same absence of growth when larvae were placed in water originating from the <b>Scour</b> <b>basin,</b> while in sea water originating from elsewhere, the offspring the stage of metamorphose of larvae was reached within 10 days. Possible causes for the unsuccessfulness are discussed in detail. We can deduce that the responsible factor would be of toxic order, and that its origin can most probably be found in the ever-growing pollution in the harbour of Ostend, which water feeds the <b>Scour</b> <b>basin...</b>|$|E
50|$|Desolation Wilderness {{supports}} predominantly red fir and {{lodgepole pine}} forests with associated {{species such as}} Jeffrey pine, mountain hemlock, ponderosa pine, western juniper, and western white pine. Most forested areas occur between 7,400-9,000 foot (2250-2750 m) elevations, becoming patchy to rare at higher elevations. These hardy trees take root in excessively rocky and often nutrient-poor soils. As much of the ground surface in Desolation is bedrock granite: soils are limited. Decomposed granite accumulations are often shallow deposits within glacially <b>scoured</b> <b>basins.</b> The most extensive forested areas are found on moist soils bordering lakes, streams, and meadows. The limited tree cover in Desolation is valuable for watershed protection, wildlife habitat, and aesthetics.|$|R
50|$|Llangorse Lake is a {{eutrophic}} glacial {{lake with}} a 5 mi circumference covering {{an area of}} 327 acre. The lake is 1 mi long and 505 ft above sea level. The lake is sited between the basins of the River Wye {{to the north and}} the River Usk to the south, and occupies a glacially <b>scoured</b> rock <b>basin</b> partly enhanced by morainic debris. The Afon Llynfi provides the main input of water into the lake and continues as the lake overflow stream. The lake has a maximum depth of 7.5m.|$|R
40|$|The Gulf of Maine, an embayment of the New England margin, is floored by shallow, glacially <b>scoured</b> <b>basins</b> {{that are}} partly filled with late Pleistocene and Holocene silt and clay {{containing}} 0. 7 to 1. 0 wt percent TiO 2, chiefly {{in the form}} of silt-size rutile. Eleven basins in the gulf are estimated to contain 479 X 100 metric tons of TiO 2 (to a depth of 10 m) in the U. S. exclusive conomic zone and 168 X 100 in Canada, based on analyses of surface sediment and of cores 10 to 20 m long. The U. S. annually consumes approximately 1 X 100 metric tons of TiO 2, of which 73 percent is imported. The inferred amount of fine-grained TiOe in the basins is large, and we interpret it to be predominantly rutile; but no attempt has been made yet to mine and beneficiate the fine-grained ore. Sedimentary rocks of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and northern Maine contain fine-grained rutile crystals and have been the major source of the fine-grained sediment in the Gulf of Maine basins during and after the Wisconsinan glaciation. We conclude that much of the rutile in the Gulf of Maine mud formed diagenetically in poorly cemented Carboniferous and Triassic coarse-•,rained sedimentary rocks of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick after the dissolution o...|$|R
50|$|The {{dominant}} {{rocks of}} the Seefeld Plateaus are Wetterstein limestone and main dolomite with scattered occurrences of bituminous slate. A {{branch of the}} ice age Inn Glacier <b>scoured</b> out several <b>basins</b> and left lakes behind such as the Wildsee, the Möserer See and the Wildmoossee as well as numerous raised bogs like the Reither Moor that were formed by the silting up of lakes.|$|R
50|$|Glacial {{motion is}} {{the motion of}} glaciers, which can be likened to rivers of ice. It has played an {{important}} role in sculpting many landscapes. Most lakes in the world occupy <b>basins</b> <b>scoured</b> out by glaciers. Glacial motion can be fast (up to 30 m/day, observed on Jakobshavn Isbræ in Greenland) or slow (0.5 m/year on small glaciers or in the center of ice sheets), but is typically around 1 metre/day.|$|R
50|$|To {{the east}} of the canyons are the high peaks of the Sierra Crest, which attain an {{elevation}} of 14248 ft at the summit of North Palisade, the highest point in the park. This is classic high Sierra country: barren alpine ridges and glacially <b>scoured</b> lake-filled <b>basins.</b> Usually snow free only from late June until late October, the high country is accessible only via foot and horse trails. The Sierran crest forms the eastern boundary of the park, from Mount Goethe in the north, down to Junction Peak, at the boundary with Sequoia National Park. Several passes cross the crest into the park, including Bishop Pass, Taboose Pass, Sawmill Pass, and Kearsarge Pass. All of these passes are above 11000 ft elevation.|$|R
50|$|Hallett Cove at {{this time}} {{was part of a}} river valley orientated with the {{mountain}} range to the NE. Ice had <b>scoured</b> a <b>basin</b> and meltwater from the retreating glacier formed a lake which deposited the sediments that can be seen today along the clifftops. Although no fossils have been found in these sediments, arthropod trails have been found in similar sediments further south. Dropstones and erratics, rocks carried by glaciers which drop when they melt, litter the beach where the Permian sediments that once held them have long since been eroded away. Smaller ones can be found still embedded in the sediments. Most of the dropstones, some bigger than cars, originated from sites hundreds of km to the south, however, several consist of rock not found in South Australia and their origin has yet to be determined. One erratic currently eroding out at the top of Black Cliff is dated 400 Million years older than the oldest Hallett Cove rocks. Made of Tillite, it is the earliest evidence of glaciation ever recorded.|$|R
40|$|When water {{released}} from an outlet in reservoir whether from gate, valves or tunnels or conduits and over spillway, it attains high velocity. This high velocity {{is generated by}} virtue of changing its potential head from the reservoir level {{to the level of}} the river on the downstream. This higher velocity causes scouring downstream structure. To safe guard against such <b>scouring,</b> suitable stilling <b>basin</b> are designed, in which energy of flowing water is reduced. In this paper, different types of stilling basin models designed by past investigators are presented with their appurtenances and these models are compared on the basis of stilling basin length...|$|R
40|$|Local <b>scour</b> {{downstream}} stilling <b>basins</b> is {{so complex}} {{that it makes}} it difficult to establish a general empirical model to provide accurate estimation for scour depth. Lack estimation of local scour can endanger to stability of hydraulic structure and can cause risk of failure. This paper presents Gene expression program (GEP) and artificial neural network (ANNs), to simulate local scour depth downstream hydraulic structures. The experimental data is collected from the literature for the scour depth downstream the stilling basin through a trapezoidal channel. Using GEP approach gives satisfactory results compared with artificial neural network (ANN) and multiple linear regression (MLR) modeling in predicting the scour depth downstream of hydraulic structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{paradigm}} of aquatic food webs has undergone fundamental revision {{over the past}} twenty years. Research suggests that a significant proportion of organic material and energy in aquatic ecosystems flows through a "microbial loop" before passage into the classic aquatic food web. Unique Antarctic conditions mean such "bottom-up" control can be of extreme importance during the austral winter. In order to investigate this, the microbial communities and physico-chemical properties of three saline lakes in the Vestfold Hills, eastern Antarctica, Ace, Highway and Rookery, were investigated between December 1995 and February 1997. The lakes of the Vestfold Hills were formed approximately 8000 years ago following a period of post-glacial marine transgression, which isolated seawater in glacially <b>scoured</b> <b>basins.</b> Post-formation, the chemistry and biology of this isolated seawater underwent significant changes creating a suite of lakes and ponds with highly varied chemical and biological compositions. This study was concerned with meromictic Ace Lake in particular. Physico-chemical results demonstrated that the lake was highly stratified. An upper, nutrient-poor mixolimnion was separated by a thermoclinelhalocline from a lower, nutrient-replete monimolimnion. The monimolimnion was further stratified in terms of oxygen; an oxycline separated an oxic upper stratum from an anoxic lower stratum. At the oxycline, organic substrate sedimenting from above and inorganic nutrients diffusing from below were entrained. This stable stratification exerted a profound influence on the microbial dynamics of Ace Lake. Over the course of its evolution the microbial food web of Ace Lake was truncated and a simple, low diversity community of bacteria, algae and Protozoa, with a paucity of metazoan zooplankton, now dominates. This evolutionary process was illustrated by the intermediate diversity of the protozoan community in recently formed, Rookery Lake. The most dominant micro-organisms in Ace Lake were those which were highly motile and employed versatile nutritional strategies, such as mixotrophy, to remain physiologically active during the austral winter. Ace Lake is an oligotrophic system which receives negligible allochthonous inputs of organic carbon and inorganic nutrients. However, a simple model of the carbon flux within Ace Lake highlighted the fact that autotrophic production within the plankton was insufficient alone to maintain the level of heterotrophic activity observed. Instead, the microbial plankton were dependent on regenerative fluxes of inorganic nutrients and slow-turnover autochthonous carbon, consistent with the concept of the microbial loop...|$|R
50|$|The Lewitz was formed, {{like the}} whole of Mecklenburg, in the last ice age. When the glacier melted it filled the Lewitz and the Stör valley with meltwater which <b>scoured</b> out a <b>basin,</b> 12,000 {{hectares}} in area. A 16 metre deep lake was formed. Later it suddenly emptied southwards. The lake became marshy and turned into peat {{over the course of}} the following millennia. Shallow waterbodies and fens (Niedermoore). In the Middle Stone Age its island-like hills, small lakes and woods offered hunters, gatherers and fishers suitable places to settle. Likewise the dried out, sandy moorlands were suitable for the arable farmers and cattle breeders of the New Stone Age. During that time several Funnelbeaker culture earthworks were constructed.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the rocks}} in the park belong to the Archeon Quetico Subprovince, of the Superior Physiographic province, {{associated}} with the Kenoran Orogeny. These consist of schists and gneisses {{in the west and}} central portion of the park, and granitic rocks of the Vermillion Granitic Complex (2.69 to 2.64 Ga) in the east and southeast. The Kabetogama-Kenora dike swarm (2.2. to 2.1 Ga) follows a northwesterly trending Precambrian fault system. The northwest corner of the park contains metamorphosed rocks of the Wabigoon subprovince, which form a northeast trending greenstone belt. A lateral strike-slip fault separates the two subprovinces, referred to as the Rainy Lake-Seine River fault zone. It is this northwest area of the park, on the Kabetogama peninsula, which saw a gold rush from 1893 to 1898. The Little American Mine, on Little American Island, is one of 13 abandoned mines within park boundaries. Terminal moraines are found in the southern portion of the park, while the northern portion contains glacially <b>scoured</b> lake <b>basins,</b> but accumulations of glacial outwash and glacial till less than 100 feet is the norm. Lake Agassiz deposits are evident within the park, while glacial striations and glacial erratics are common.|$|R
50|$|The {{volumes of}} coal transported along the canal {{were lower than}} had been predicted, {{hampered}} {{by the lack of}} a proper link from Coalisland to the collieries, but trade in flaxseed, grain, rock salt, timber, fish and coarse hardware gradually built up. However, its condition deteriorated, and by 1801, it was almost derelict. Control of inland waterways was returned to central government, and the Directors General of Inland Waterways send an engineer called Henry Walker to inspect it. He began work on repairing the canal, but was dismissed and replaced by John Brownrigg in September 1801, as similar work he had carried out on the Newry Canal was alleged to be defective. Brownrigg reported that much of the canal was dangerous, and a third opinion was sought from the engineer Daniel Monks. Between 1801 and 1812, over £20,000 was spent on the canal, which included <b>scouring</b> the <b>basin</b> at Coalisland, building wharves, stores and boundary walls around it, rebuilding of lock walls and floors, dredging the whole canal to give a depth of 4.5 ft, repairs to lock houses, puddling of the lower reaches where it passed through peat, and upgrading of the towpaths.|$|R
500|$|Prior to its opening, Tennant {{estimated}} that the canal would carry 99,994 tons per year, and generate £7,915 in income. Traffic built up, and by the 1830s, annual tonnage was around 90,000 tons, but revenues were less than anticipated, and produced a profit of about £2,500 per year. Initially, it {{was known as the}} Neath and Swansea Junction Canal, but by 1845 it had become known as the Tennant Canal. The water was [...] deep between Red Jacket and Aberdulais, and [...] deep from Red Jacket to Swansea harbour. This provided a large reservoir of water, which was used to <b>scour</b> the tidal <b>basin</b> at Port Tennant. Boats typically carried 25 tons, which allowed them to work on the Neath Canal as well. Several short branches were built, including one to the Vale of Neath Brewery which opened in 1839 and was privately funded by the brewery. In the same year, the Glan-y-wern Canal was dredged and re-opened.|$|R
40|$|Upper and Middle Waterton lakes fill a glacially <b>scoured</b> bedrock <b>basin</b> {{in a large}} (614 km 2) {{watershed}} in {{the eastern}} Front Ranges of the Rocky Mountains of southern Alberta, Canada and northern Montana, U. S. A. The stratigraphic infill of the lake has been imaged with 123 km of single-channel FM sonar (‘chirp’) reflection profiles. Offshore sonar data are combined with more than 2. 5 km of multi-channel, land-based seismic reflection profiles collected from a large fan-delta. Three seismic stratigraphic successions (SSS I to III) are identified in Waterton Lake resting on a prominent basal reflector (bedrock) that reaches a maximum depth of about 250 m below lake level. High-standing rock steps (reigels) divide the lake into sub-basins that can be mapped using lake floor reflection coefficients. A lowermost transparent to poorly stratified seismic succession (SSS I, up to 30 m thick) is present locally between bedrock highs and has high seismic velocities (1750 – 2100 m=s) typical of compact till or outwash. A second stratigraphic succession (SSS II, up to 50 m thick), occurs throughout the lake basin and is characterised by continuous, closely spaced reflectors typical of repetitively bedded and rhythmically laminated silts and clays most likely deposited by underflows from fan-deltas; paleo-depositional surfaces identify likely source areas during deglaciation. Intervals of acoustically transparent seismic facies, up to 5 m thick, are present within SSS II. At {{the northern end of}} Upper Waterton Lake, SSS II has a hummocky surface underlain by collapse structures and chaotic facies recording the melt of buried ice. Sediment collapse may have triggered downslope mass flow...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBarrage {{regulators}} are {{considered as one}} of the most important projects in the Egyptian irrigation practice, which is obvious by its controlling of the released discharge and both of upstream and downstream water levels. In the present time, the ministry of water resources and irrigation starts to construct new barrages on the River Nile instead of the oldest ones, which are not able to withstand the requirements of increasing head difference between the upstream and downstream water levels upon the gates. The present study was focused on investigating the effect of different shapes of stilling basins of regulator on the length of the submerged hydraulic jump, velocity profiles along the apron, and local scour downstream regulator floor. Extensive experimental program was conducted on a re-circulating flume with 1. 0 m wide, 26. 0 m long and 1. 2 m deep, with discharges range from 40 to 190 l/s. The relative velocity near bed, and shear Reynolds number were studied to fix the best shape of stilling basin that could reduce both of length of submerged hydraulic jump and local <b>scour</b> downstream stilling <b>basin.</b> Statistical equation was developed to correlate the length of submerged jump with the other independent parameters. Finally, clear matching of results from the length of jump and velocity analysis was investigated...|$|R
40|$|Block ramps {{can reduce}} the impact of anthropic river {{restoration}} structures on the river eco-systems. The correct assessment of their effects on the river system {{in which they are}} located is depending on several factors. Among others, the most relevant are: the hydraulic and geometric parameters characterizing the river branch and the geometry of the stilling basin. In particular, this last aspect is of fundamental importance as the downstream stilling basin has a significant role both for the structure stability and for the dissipative process. Nevertheless, the stilling basin geometry is a key parameter for scour morphology characteristics. The aim of the present paper is to compare the morphological characteristics of the <b>scour</b> hole in <b>basins</b> characterized by different geometries downstream of block ramps. Namely, the analysis of scour hole profiles and characteristics were conducted for stilling basins with the same width of the upstream ramp and compared with those occurring in symmetrically and asymmetrically enlarged basins, in order to highlight similitudes and differences. The comparison of scour typologies occurring under different stilling basin configurations was discussed and analyzed. The results of the analysis put in evidence the prominent effect of the stilling basin configurations on both scour hole dimensions and flow features. In particular, the knowledge of different scour typologies occurring in the tested stilling basins could be extremely beneficial for a correct design of the structure...|$|R
40|$|A basinÃ¢Â�Â�like area {{containing}} three interior layer deposits (ILDs) on {{the southern}} margin of Coprates Chasma was studied. We interpret the area as an ancestral basin and demonstrate that ILD deposition postdates {{the formation of the}} current wall rock slopes. The geometry of the ILD and the wall rock spurs form a catchment area between each ILD and the plateau to the south. Erosional remnants of extensive ash or dust layers deposited on the plateau south of Valles Marineris also crop out {{on the southern}} plateau of Coprates Chasma. A mass balance calculation suggests that the volume of each ILD is compatible with the volume of the ash or dust that would have been deposited within each catchment area. We propose that the ILDs likely formed by episodically washing such aerially deposited material down from chasma walls. Rifting of the IusÃ¢Â�Â�MelasÃ¢Â�Â�Coprates graben opened the enclosed basin and removed any standing water. Faults within the ILDs are compatible with this chasm opening. Sulfates are associated with the ILDs and lightÃ¢Â�Â�toned material on the basin floor. We suggest that they result from water alteration of preexisting deposits, though the timing of that alteration may predate or postdate the breaching of the <b>basin.</b> <b>Scours</b> within one ILD are similar to terrestrial glacial scours.
