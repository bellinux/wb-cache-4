25|$|A water {{treatment}} plant in Boudouaou, which provides more than 12% of the treated water to the Boumerdès and Algiers, suffered light damage to the clarifiers and clear water storage tanks. The water pipeline from the Keddara Dam to the {{water treatment}} plant was broken at a concrete junction structure at the dam, {{as well as at}} the treatment plant. The main power plant in Cap Djenet suffered minor to moderate damage. A high voltage <b>switch</b> <b>yard</b> located near Réghaïa had heavy damage.|$|E
25|$|Most nuclear {{stations}} require {{two distinct}} sources of offsite {{power feeding station}} service transformers that are sufficiently separated in the station's switchyard and can receive power from multiple transmission lines. In addition in some nuclear stations the turbine generator can power the station's house loads while the station is online via station service transformers which tap power from the generator output bus bars {{before they reach the}} step-up transformer (these stations also have station service transformers that receive offsite power directly from the <b>switch</b> <b>yard).</b> Even with the redundancy of two power sources total loss of offsite power is still possible. Nuclear power stations are equipped with emergency power.|$|E

40|$|Freight {{railroad}} terminals receive inbound trains, classify or regroup railcars, {{and build}} outbound trains.

Finally, we illustrate the use of simulation model to improve terminal operations. ...|$|R
