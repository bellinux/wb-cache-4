25|$|There is <b>scientific</b> <b>concern</b> that {{extended}} spaceflight might {{slow down the}} body's ability to protect itself against diseases. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and cause both short and long-term damage to the bone marrow stem cells which create the blood and immune systems. In particular, it causes 'chromosomal aberrations' in lymphocytes. As these cells {{are central to the}} immune system, any damage weakens the immune system, which means that in addition to increased vulnerability to new exposures, viruses already present in the body—which would normally be suppressed—become active. In space, T-cells (a form of lymphocyte) are less able to reproduce properly, and the T-cells that do reproduce are less able to fight off infection. Over time immunodeficiency results in the rapid spread of infection among crew members, especially in the confined areas of space flight systems.|$|E

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to these criticisms, Harris received {{support from a}} number of humanist and atheist figures, including Ben Goldacre, Simon Singh and Dave Gorman.

50|$|There is {{also some}} <b>scientific</b> <b>concern</b> that {{extended}} spaceflight might {{slow down the}} body’s ability to protect itself against diseases.

Radiation can cause both {{short and long term}} consequences to the bone marrow stem cells which create the blood and immune systems. Because the interior of a spacecraft is so small, a weakened immune system and more active viruses in the body can lead to a fast spread of infection.|$|E

5000|$|Dionne's {{first major}} {{publication}} was his 1882 Les oiseaux du Canada ("The Birds of Canada"), which he dedicated to Provancher. It replaced a smaller, mostly outdated book published in 1860 by James MacPherson Le Moine. Les oiseaux du Canada, while well {{received in the}} French community, received mixed reviews from English-language scholars, particularly Montague Chamberlain, who deplored [...] "its utter worthlessness as an authentic work". The precise amount of personal jealousy (Chamberlain was preparing his own Catalogue of Canadian Birds) and <b>scientific</b> <b>concern</b> (Dionne's work only truly covered Quebec, and used the soon-to-be obsolete classification of Coues) is difficult to assess.

5000|$|The policy {{recommendations}} have proved controversial.

[...] In a 2010 paper, Nierenberg's son Nicolas disputes each of these points, arguing that the scientific conclusions of the report reflected the current consensus and pointing out that other climate reports from the time also stopped short of recommending near-term energy-policy changes.|$|E

50|$|As {{articulated}} originally by René Descartes, {{and named}} much later, the Critical mode of inquiry seeks {{to arrive at}} the undistorted truth by filtering one's encounter with reality through a lens of extreme suspicion and doubt. Since its emergence as the predominant epistemic paradigm of Modernity, the Critical mode has been assailed by many thinkers, including those mentioned previously, for breeding a pervasive skepticism toward higher-order realities and ideals that contributes to an attitude of rootlessness, nihilism, and despair by disparaging meaning, purpose, and value so that they function only as arbitrary or evolved creations of the human mind. Those critics have noted the resulting idolization of reductionistic objectivity to such an extent as to naively overlook the presence of the observer from the observation, and to devalue subjective experience (as opposed to behavior) as a <b>scientific</b> <b>concern.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} to the economic and environmental significance of droughts, <b>scientific</b> <b>concern</b> has been expressed regarding climate change impacts on future drought frequency, duration, and severity over various regions of the globe including Canada. Climate models are projecting considerable increases to temperature and in general, small increases to precipitation over southern Canada. This translates into future increases of summer continental interior drying and associated risk of droughts. The increased drought risk is attributed {{to a combination of}} increased temperature and potential evapotranspiration not being balanced by precipitation. Note that considerable uncertainty exists with respect to future precipitation, particularly on a regional basis. Furthermore, there is little consensus regarding future changes to teleconnections and since these patterns {{have a significant impact on}} temperature and precipitation over Canada, insight into the relative occurrence of future drought remains a huge knowledge gap.|$|E

50|$|Inulin was {{discovered}} in 1804 by German scientist Valentin Rose. He found “a peculiar substance” from Inula helenium roots by boiling water extraction. The substance was named inulin because of I. helenium, {{but it is also}} called helenin, alatin, and meniantin. Indigestible polysaccharides were of great <b>scientific</b> <b>concern</b> {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century. Irvine used chemical methods like methylation to study the molecular structure of inulin, and designed the isolation method for this new anhydrofructose. During studies of renal tubules in the 1930s, researchers searched for a substance that can serve as a biomarker that is not reabsorbed or secreted after introduction into tubules. Richards introduced inulin because of its high molecular weight and its resistance to enzymes. Today, inulin is used as an active ingredient for functional foods, and it is also used to determine the glomerular filtration rate.|$|E
5000|$|According to Guillermo Paz-y-Miño-C and Avelina Espinosa, the {{historical}} conflict between evolution and religion is intrinsic to the incompatibility between scientific rationalism/empiricism {{and the belief}} in supernatural causation; these authors have formally proposed the incompatibility hypothesis (IH) to explain the [...] "everlasting-conflict-science-and-faith". According to Jerry Coyne, views on evolution and levels of religiosity in some countries, along with the existence of books explaining reconciliation between evolution and religion, indicate that people have trouble in believing {{both at the same}} time, thus implying incompatibility.According to Lawrence Krauss, compatibility or incompatibility is a theological concern, not a <b>scientific</b> <b>concern.</b> [...] In Lisa Randall's view, questions of incompatibility or otherwise are not answerable since by accepting revelations one is abandoning rules of logic which are needed to identify if there are indeed contradictions between holding certain beliefs.

50|$|Crew {{living on}} the International Space Station (ISS) are {{partially}} protected from the space environment by Earth's magnetic field, as the magnetosphere deflects solar wind around {{the earth and the}} ISS. Nevertheless, solar flares are powerful enough to warp and penetrate the magnetic defences, and so are still a hazard to the crew. The crew of Expedition 10 took shelter as a precaution in 2005 in a more heavily shielded part of the station designed for this purpose. However, beyond the limited protection of Earth's magnetosphere, interplanetary manned missions are much more vulnerable. Lawrence Townsend of the University of Tennessee and others have studied the most powerful solar flare ever recorded. Radiation doses astronauts would receive from a flare of this magnitude could cause acute radiation sickness and possibly even death. There is <b>scientific</b> <b>concern</b> that extended spaceflight might slow down the body's ability to protect itself against diseases. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and cause both short and long-term damage to the bone marrow stem cells which create the blood and immune systems.
