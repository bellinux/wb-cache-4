5|$|Einstein's {{equations}} are {{the centerpiece}} of general relativity. They provide a precise formulation {{of the relationship between}} spacetime geometry and the properties of matter, using the language of mathematics. More concretely, they are formulated using the concepts of Riemannian geometry, in which the geometric properties of a <b>space</b> (<b>or</b> a spacetime) are described by a quantity called a metric. The metric encodes the information needed to compute the fundamental geometric notions of distance and angle in a curved <b>space</b> (<b>or</b> spacetime).|$|E

5|$|Although Yarralumla {{is one of}} {{the largest}} suburbs in Canberra by area, its {{population}} remains quite small because more than half of its area consists of open <b>space</b> <b>or</b> non-residential development, including Weston and Stirling Parks, the Royal Canberra Golf Club, and the grounds of Government House. A relatively high proportion of houses are occupied by diplomatic missions.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, it was {{announced}} that Voyager 1 might have become the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space, having detected a marked change in the plasma environment on August 25, 2012. However, until September 12, 2013, it was still an open question as to whether the new region was interstellar <b>space</b> <b>or</b> an unknown region of the Solar System. At that time, the former alternative was officially confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Some exact {{solutions}} describe {{gravitational waves}} without any approximation, e.g., a wave train traveling through empty <b>space</b> <b>or</b> Gowdy universes, varieties of an expanding cosmos filled with gravitational waves. But for gravitational waves produced in astrophysically relevant situations, {{such as the}} merger of two black holes, numerical methods are presently {{the only way to}} construct appropriate models.|$|E

50|$|K-theory {{involves}} {{the construction of}} families of K-functors that map from topological <b>spaces</b> <b>or</b> schemes to associated rings; these rings reflect {{some aspects of the}} structure of the original <b>spaces</b> <b>or</b> schemes. As with functors to groups in algebraic topology, the reason for this functorial mapping is that it is easier to compute some topological properties from the mapped rings than from the original <b>spaces</b> <b>or</b> schemes. Examples of results gleaned from the K-theory approach include the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch theorem, Bott periodicity, the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, and the Adams operations.|$|R

In addition {{it was one of the}} 10 founders of the European Space Agency in 1975 and is the seventh largest contributor to the ESA budget. In the private sector, several companies are implicated in the space industry such as Oerlikon <b>Space</b> <b>or</b> Maxon Motors who provide spacecraft structures.|$|E
5|$|The Circus {{is seen as}} the {{pinnacle}} of Wood's work. It consists of three long, curved terraces designed by the elder John Wood to form a circular <b>space</b> <b>or</b> theatre intended for civic functions and games.

5|$|A Markov {{chain is}} a type of Markov process that has either {{discrete}} state <b>space</b> <b>or</b> discrete index set (often representing time), but the precise definition of a Markov chain varies. For example, it is common to define a Markov chain as a Markov process in either discrete or continuous time with a countable state space (thus regardless of the nature of time), but it is also common to define a Markov chain as having discrete time in either countable or continuous state space (thus regardless of the state space).|$|E

5|$|According to the {{economic}} theory behind congestion pricing, {{the objective of this}} policy is the use of the price mechanism to make users more aware of the costs that they impose upon one another when consuming during the peak demand, and that they should pay for the additional congestion they create, thus encouraging the redistribution of the demand in <b>space</b> <b>or</b> in time, or shifting it to the consumption of a substitute public good; for example, switching from private transport to public transport.|$|E
5|$|Commercial 'dolphin encounter' {{enterprises}} and tours operate in many countries. The documentary film The Cove documents how dolphins are captured {{and sold to}} some of these enterprises (particularly in Asia) while the remaining pod is slaughtered. In addition to such endeavors, the individuals swim with and surface near surfers at the beach. Bottlenose dolphins perform in many aquaria, generating controversy. Animal welfare activists and certain scientists have claimed that the dolphins do not have adequate <b>space</b> <b>or</b> receive adequate care or stimulation. However, others, notably SeaWorld (backed by different scientists), counter that the dolphins are properly cared for, have lots of environmental stimulation and enjoy interacting with humans.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the switch}} to 3D, the game is still played {{primarily}} from an overhead perspective similar to the original 2D Metal Gear games. However, the camera angle will change during certain situations, such as a corner view when Snake flattens himself to a wall next to an open <b>space,</b> <b>or</b> into first-person when crawling under tight spaces or using certain items such as the binoculars or a sniper rifle. The player can also use the first-person view while remaining idle to look around Snake's surroundings or see what's ahead of him.|$|E

50|$|In mathematics, {{there are}} usually many {{different}} ways to construct a topological tensor product of two topological vector spaces. For Hilbert <b>spaces</b> <b>or</b> nuclear <b>spaces</b> there is a simple well-behaved theory of tensor products (see Tensor product of Hilbert spaces), but for general Banach <b>spaces</b> <b>or</b> locally convex topological vector spaces the theory is notoriously subtle.|$|R

5|$|Kiarostami's {{style is}} notable {{for the use}} of long shots, such as in the closing {{sequences}} of Life, and Nothing More... and Through the Olive Trees, where the audience is intentionally distanced physically from the characters to invite reflection on their fate. Taste of Cherry is punctuated throughout by shots of this kind, including distant overhead shots of the suicidal Badii's car moving across the hills, usually while he is in conversation with a passenger. The physical distancing techniques stand in juxtaposition to the dialogue, which always remains in the foreground. Like the coexistence of private and public <b>space,</b> <b>or</b> the frequent framing of landscapes through car windows, this fusion of distance with proximity has been seen as a way of generating suspense in the most mundane of moments.|$|E
5|$|Main {{memory in}} a {{parallel}} computer is either shared memory (shared between all processing elements in a single address <b>space),</b> <b>or</b> distributed memory (in which each processing element has its own local address space). Distributed memory refers {{to the fact that}} the memory is logically distributed, but often implies that it is physically distributed as well. Distributed shared memory and memory virtualization combine the two approaches, where the processing element has its own local memory and access to the memory on non-local processors. Accesses to local memory are typically faster than accesses to non-local memory.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{development}} at this time consisted of new residential areas away from the old city centre. Queen Square was the first speculative development by John Wood, the Elder, who lived {{in one of the}} houses. The Circus consists of three long, curved terraces designed by the elder John Wood to form a circular <b>space</b> <b>or</b> theatre intended for civic functions and games. The games give a clue to the design, the inspiration behind which was the Colosseum in Rome. The most spectacular of Bath's terraces is the Royal Crescent, built between 1767 and 1774 and designed by the younger John Wood. Gay Street links Queen Square to The Circus. All of which were designed by John Wood, the Elder in 1735 and completed by his son John Wood, the Younger.|$|E

5|$|Other {{aspects of}} the excise law also caused concern. The law {{required}} all stills to be registered, and those cited for failure to pay the tax had to appear in distant Federal, rather than local courts. The only Federal courthouse was in Philadelphia, some 300 {{miles away from the}} small frontier settlement of Pittsburgh. From the beginning, the Federal government had little success in collecting the whiskey tax along the frontier. Many small western distillers simply refused to pay the tax. Federal revenue officers and local residents who assisted them bore the brunt of the protester's ire. Tax rebels harassed several whiskey tax collectors and threatened or beat those who offered them office <b>space</b> <b>or</b> housing. As a result, many western counties never had a resident Federal tax official.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} arise when {{the concentration of}} metabolically active gases is increased. These range from the toxic effects of oxygen at high partial pressure, through buildup of carbon dioxide due to excessive work of breathing, increased dead <b>space,</b> <b>or</b> inefficient removal, to the exacerbation of the toxic effects of contaminants in the breathing gas due to the increased concentration at high pressures. Hydrostatic pressure differences between {{the interior of the}} lung and the breathing gas delivery, increased breathing gas density due to ambient pressure, and increased flow resistance due to higher breathing rates may all cause increased work of breathing and fatigue of the respiratory muscles.|$|E
5|$|Smithfield {{comprises}} {{the market as}} its central feature surrounded many old buildings on three sides and a public open <b>space</b> (<b>or</b> Rotunda Garden) at West Smithfield, beneath {{which there is a}} public car park. The south side is occupied by St Bartholomew's Hospital (known as Barts in common parlance), and on the east side by the Priory Church of St Bartholomew the Great. The Church of St Bartholomew the Less is located next to the King Henry VIII Gate, the hospital's main entrance. The north and south of the square are now closed to through traffic, as part of the City's security and surveillance cordon known as the Ring of steel. Security for the market is provided by its market constabulary.|$|E
