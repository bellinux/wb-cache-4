40|$|Time-dependent {{statistical}} {{characteristics of}} load process and <b>strength</b> <b>degradation</b> process {{are critical to}} lifetime distribution of series mechanical systems. Conventional rain-flow counting method for lifetime distribution estimation has limited practical application due to its strict requirement for statistical properties of load process.

SDPD and failure dependence of components jointly bring considerable difficulties in prediction of system lifetime distribution and system residual lifetime distribution.

As an alternative solution, the use of high-performance fiber-reinforced cement composites (HPFRCC) with an economical type of Poly Vinyl Alcohol (PVA) fibers in column elements was investigated in this paper. Six column specimens with 2 / 3 scale including three standard reinforced columns and three columns using PVA fibers were tested. In the research work herein presented, biaxial cyclic lateral loads were applied to specimens subjected to either 10 % or 30 % constant axial loads. The experimental results are presented and the global behaviors of the tested columns are discussed, particularly focusing on stiffness and <b>strength</b> <b>degradations</b> due to increasing cyclic demand. Test results indicated superior damage tolerance and stable inelastic load-displacement responses up to 5 % or 9 % drift for the HPFRCC columns, even though they suffered severe shear cracks.

40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} of {{parameter}} determination in the fatigue residual <b>strength</b> <b>degradation</b> model is proposed. The new method and minimization technique are compared experimentally {{to account for}} the effect of tension-compression fatigue loading on structural materials. It is shown that the correlation between experimental results and the theoretical prediction of the fatigue life, fatigue life distribution obtained by the proposed method is very reasonable. Inroduction For the first time, a statistical approach to the residual <b>strength</b> <b>degradation</b> model under fatigue loading was formulated by Broutman [1]. Yang [2] proposed the residual <b>strength</b> <b>degradation</b> model, which made the fatigue characteristics prediction possible. And then he validated the proposed model with experimental data. Though the residual <b>strength</b> <b>degradation</b> model, which is expressed such as Weibull distribution [3 - 5], requires the exact parameter determination, however, it is not easy. Many physicist studied hard for the parameter determination method [2 - 5], but the results are not sufficient. This paper proposed a new method for the parameter determination. In order to validate the proposed method, experiments were undertaken to acquire fatigue performances of spheroidal graphite cast iron and carbon/epoxy composite materials under tension-compression fatigue loading...|$|E

40|$|The thermal shock/fatigue {{behavior}} of monolithic and composite hot-gas candle filters obtained from various manufacturers was evaluated. The composite filters {{were made of}} both oxide and nonoxide materials; the monolithic filters were made only of nonoxide materials. During single-cycle thermal shock tests, composite filters show little or no <b>strength</b> <b>degradation</b> when quenched from temperatures between 900 and 1000 {degrees}C. At higher quenching temperatures, slow <b>strength</b> <b>degradation</b> was observed. Regular monolithic SiC filters showed no <b>strength</b> <b>degradation</b> when quenched from temperatures up to {approx} 700 - 900 {degrees}C, whereas at higher quenching temperatures, the strength decreased at a relatively sharper rate. On the other hand, recrystallized monolithic SiC filters showed higher initial strength and retained this strength to higher quenching temperatures when compared with regular SiC filters.

40|$|When {{subjected}} to {{events such as}} earthquakes, engineering structures typically exhibit a nonlinear and hysteretic behaviour with stiffness and <b>strength</b> <b>degradations.</b> Though a reliable evaluation of safety conditions should {{take into account the}} nonlinear dynamic and evolutionary nature of the structural response, the experimental identification of a nonlinear behaviour under dynamic and seismic loading is, to date, an open problem. The present research aims at evaluating the potential of different restoring force models for simulating the seismic response of hysteretic structural systems, with special emphasis on the two main problems encountered when applying this approach to full-scale structures under intense excitation: (a) a markedly time-dependent behaviour; (b) need to compare among different restoring force models, either expressed in a parametric or polynomial form. In particular, polynomial models will be formulated both in terms of restoring force and its derivative, in order to present a comprehensive discussion of different strategies. The nonlinear identification technique employed in this paper is required to account for a time-dependent behaviour. In fact, in presence of degradation or any other time-varying characteristics, instantaneous identification certainly constitutes an enhancement of the classical restoring force based approach, and may as well provide checks on the consistency of the assumed model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Factors {{affecting}} {{the shape of}} failure rate curve are analyzed, and four elements including load, <b>strength,</b> <b>degradation</b> and lifetime index (namely, the number of load application and time) are proposed for calculating the failure rate of components. Taking the number of load application and time as the life index, respectively, the failure rate models of components consisting of four elements is developed, which can embody the effect of parameters of load, <b>strength,</b> <b>degradation</b> and life. Then, the rules that the reliability and failure rate changes as life index are studied. The result shows that the failure rate curves are partially or whole bathtub-shaped. For different parameters of load, strength and <b>strength</b> <b>degradation,</b> the curves of reliability and failure rate of components changing with time present different shapes.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this paper, a {{wear-out}} model, {{which is}} based on the concept of deterministic <b>strength</b> <b>degradation</b> and equal ranking between static and residual strengths, is used to assess the fatigue behaviors of several different sandwich beams. The model requires only two parameters to describe the <b>strength</b> <b>degradation</b> in fatigue. One parameter represents the rate of <b>strength</b> <b>degradation</b> and the other a relative fatigue life. A new approach is used to determine these parameters from experimental data. The model is shown to be able to describe rather well both the static strength distributions and the fatigue stress-life relations of the sandwich beams. The residual strength distribution after 5000 cycles was predicted for the Eglass–vinylester–D 100 balsa wood sandwich at 60 % maximum stress level with the f and s obtained through the fitting method developed in this paper.

The experimental program conducted in two models of HRSP-UHSC specimens were loaded by {{combination of a}} constant axial compression force and quasi static lateral cyclic loads through actuators on the loading frame. The lateral loads were based on displacement controls in ACI 374. 1 - 05 (2005). The constant axial compression forces were applied into the HRSP- 70 and HRSP- 60 of 0. 075 fc’Ag and 0. 15 fc’Ag, respectively. The experimental {{results indicate that the}} increasing of the axial compression force ratio enhances the shear strength significantly, but then it experiences higher <b>strength</b> <b>degradations</b> with lower attainment of drift ratio and displacement ductility factor.
