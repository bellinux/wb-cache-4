500|$|By then, {{the rivalry}} between the FW boats and the BC Express boats was quite heated and it soon {{came down to}} a race. The Conveyor had proved itself to be swifter than its sister ship Operator, as had the BX proven swifter than the BC Express, <b>so</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> in July, the Conveyor's Captain Shannon {{challenged}} Captain Browne to a race to Quesnel from Soda Creek. The rules were rather odd, as the BX was still obligated to stop and deliver her mail at several different landings whereas the Conveyor had no such obligation and could run right through. As the race progressed, it soon became obvious to all that the BX was the faster boat, as she had stayed ahead {{for most of the}} race, despite having to stop several times. At one landing the BX had more mail to deliver than usual and had fallen behind the Conveyor, but she soon caught up and was passing her opponent [...] when Captain Johnson rammed the BX with the Conveyor. Captain Browne immediately pulled over to inspect his boat for damages and the Conveyor pulled ahead again. Fortunately Browne soon discovered that the Conveyor had hit the BX just where the shear of her guards met {{and that there was no}} serious damage. In fact, when Browne arrived in Quesnel, he had almost caught up with the Conveyor again.|$|E
2500|$|The Greaseman {{pseudonym}} originated {{while he}} was in college. [...] "In those days of top 40, everybody who was on the radio was 'cookin'; cookin' with the Temptations, cookin' Four Tops, that kind of thing. Which meant they were really rockin'. One day I said I was cookin' with heavy grease. It was my way of saying I was out-cookin' the other guys.

2500|$|... "The Angel and the One" [...] {{serves as}} the album's closer. Some members of the band have claimed that this is their {{favorite}} track, including Pat Wilson. Cuomo stated that initially the song [...] "started out as a really standard pop song called 'bad girl' and had a verse and a chorus and bridge and all that stuff. And I just wasn't satisfied with it. It was too normal. <b>So</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> I sat down with my acoustic guitar and I just played [...] song over and over, on basically looping it. My fingers hurt so much, I just kept playing it. And over the hour that I was playing it, the song slowly evolved and it smoothed over and the sections blurred into each other. And it turned into this spiritual reverie that is really just one long [...] development without any distinction between sections." ...|$|E

2500|$|Every second {{lunar month}} has only 29 days, <b>so</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> must have two (of the 30) epact labels {{assigned}} to it. The reason for {{moving around the}} epact label [...] "xxv/25" [...] rather than any other {{seems to be the}} following: According to Dionysius (in his introductory letter to Petronius), the Nicene council, on the authority of Eusebius, established that the first month of the ecclesiastical lunar year (the paschal month) should start between 8 March and 5 April inclusive, and the 14th day fall between 21 March and 18 April inclusive, thus spanning a period of (only) 29 days. A new moon on 7 March, which has epact label [...] "xxiv", has its 14th day (full moon) on 20 March, which is too early (not following 20 March). So years with an epact of [...] "xxiv", if the lunar month beginning on 7 March had 30 days, would have their paschal new moon on 6 April, which is too late: the full moon would fall on 19 April, and Easter could be as late as 26 April. In the Julian calendar the latest date of Easter was 25 April, and the Gregorian reform maintained that limit. So the paschal full moon must fall no later than 18 April and the new moon on 5 April, which has epact label [...] "xxv". 5 April must therefore have its double epact labels [...] "xxiv" [...] and [...] "xxv". Then epact [...] "xxv" [...] must be treated differently, as explained in the paragraph above.|$|E
