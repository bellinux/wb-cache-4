Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is highly reactive and quite unstable; its salts are mostly used for their bleaching and sterilising abilities. They are very strong oxidising agents, transferring an oxygen atom to most inorganic species. Chlorous acid (HOClO) is even more unstable and cannot be isolated or concentrated without decomposition: it is known from the decomposition of aqueous chlorine dioxide. However, <b>sodium</b> <b>chlorite</b> is a stable salt and is useful for bleaching and stripping textiles, as an oxidising agent, and {{as a source of}} chlorine dioxide. Chloric acid (HOClO2) is a strong acid that is quite stable in cold water up to 30% concentration, but on warming gives chlorine and chlorine dioxide. Evaporation under reduced pressure allows it to be concentrated further to about 40%, but then it decomposes to perchloric acid, chlorine, oxygen, water, and chlorine dioxide. Its most important salt is sodium chlorate, mostly used to make chlorine dioxide to bleach paper pulp. The decomposition of chlorate to chloride and oxygen is a common way to produce oxygen in the laboratory on a small scale.

Methods: The agar diffusion assay was used to determine bacterial growth inhibition.

The combination of 10 percent povidone iodine and 0. 5 percent <b>sodium</b> hypo <b>chlorite</b> produced additive antibacterial effects against L. acidophilus. Interference was seen in some combinations such as 0. 01 percent chlorhexidine and 0. 25 percent sodium lauryl sulphate, 0. 5 percent sodium hypochlorite and 10 percent povidone iodine, and 0. 01 percent cetyl pyridium chloride and 0. 1 percent sodium fluoride. However, 0. 1 percent sodium fluoride combined with 0. 01 percent chlorhexidine did not interfere with the antibacterial effects of chlorhexidine against S. mutans or S. sanguinis. Conclusions: Combinations of common antiseptics and fluoride compounds can produce interference, synergistic, or additive effects.

Six different cantaloupes (Melon 1 to Melon 6) were individually treated. The concentration of residues in the rind for all six cantaloupes was 19. 26 ± 7. 99 ug chloride/g rind slurry and 4. 83 ± 2. 26 ug chlorate/g rind slurry. Residues were also detected in the flesh for Melon 1, 2 and 3 (0. 13 ±-. 07 ug chlorite/g flesh) but were present at very low concentrations such that the anionic species could not be identified, so total residues were reported in terms of chlorite equivalents. These residues were believed to have been caused by contamination of the flesh from residues in the rind, via the knife used for cutting during sample preparation. For Melon 4, 5, and 6 a different cutting technique was employed to prevent residue crossover and consequently no residues (at the limit of detection) were detected in the flesh. A worst-case scenario wherein flesh of cantaloupe was directly exposed to chlorine dioxide gas showed that in this case, the only residue formed was chloride (8. 12 ± 1. 01 ug Cl-/g flesh). Chlorite and chlorate are the two anions of concern, of which, chlorite was not detected and chlorate was only present in the rind. The concentration of chlorate residues that were transferred to the flesh, when the treated cantaloupe was cut, was too low to be of concern.

40|$|Development of {{heterogeneous}} {{metal oxide}} catalytic system with selective redox transition and highly recyclic feature is of challenging research in synthetic organic chemistry. In consideration with stability and reusability, very limited {{attention has been}} given so for. Nafion® is a rigid perfluropolymer backbone containing polymer bearing ion-exchangeable sulfonic acid terminal group (-SO 3 -. H+), extensively used as a solid-state protonic conductor in fuel cell applications and seldom used for chemical modification and in synthetic organic chemistry. In this thesis, we are presenting nano ruthenium oxide pyrochlore (Ru 2 Pb 2 O 7, Pyc) modified Nafion® membrane (designated as |NPyc|) catalyst for selective organic functional group transformations including oxidation of alcohols to aldehyde and ketone, amine to nitriles under ambient conditions. We are covering preparation, characterization by XRD, SEM, SECM, AFM, TGA, XAS and catalytic organic synthesis in triphasic medium with cooxidants such as H 2 O 2, NaOCl and O 2. Under optimal working condition, the membrane catalyst showed very good selectivity and good turnover for wide range of organic compounds. The |NPyc| catalyst can be recycled over > 100 times without any catalytic degradation. As to the mechanism, a high valent-oxo ruthenium redox species, perruthenate/ruthenate redox couple (Pyc-RuO 4 -/Pyc-RuO 42 -) exists in the |NPyc| believed to participate in the oxidation reaction with the co-oxidants. In continuation to the above studies, a novel ruthenium functionalized nickel hydroxide (designated as Ru/Ni(OH) 2) catalyst containing specific Ru-Ru and Ru-OHhydroxo bondings was prepared by simple solution phase procedures and characterized by XRD, IR, TGA, SEM, XPS and XAS (EXAFS and XANES). By using this as a new catalyst, series of alcohols were cleanly oxidized to corresponding aldehydes and ketones with higher turnover factors (~ 132 h- 1) than that of the literature reports, which were based on the monomeric Ru and Ru-Ru bonded catalysts. The Ru/Ni(OH) 2 can be recycled and reused without any leaching of metals. As to the mechanism, a low valent-hydroxo ruthenium species (Ru-OH) exists {{on the surface of the}} Ru/Ni(OH) 2 believed to participate in the aerobic alcohol oxidation reaction via a hydridometal pathway.

Alternatively, hydrogen peroxide may be efficiently used in small-scale applications.|$|E
5000|$|Chlorine dioxide, ClO2, is an {{unstable}} gas {{and is used}} in situ or stored as dilute aqueous solutions. Despite these limitations it finds large-scale applications for the bleaching of wood pulp, fats and oils, cellulose, flour, textiles, beeswax, skin, and {{in a number of}} other industries. It can be prepared by oxidizing <b>sodium</b> <b>chlorite</b> with chlorine ...|$|E
50|$|In {{all cases}} these {{alteration}} zones are metasomatism {{effects in the}} strictest sense, resulting in addition of potassium, silica, magnesium, and depletion of <b>sodium.</b> <b>Chlorite</b> minerals are usually more magnesian in composition within the footwall alteration zone of a VMS deposit than equivalent rocks within the same formation distally. The hangingwall to a VMS deposit is often weakly sodium depleted.|$|E
50|$|The free acid, chlorous acid, HClO2, is only stable at low concentrations. Since it {{cannot be}} concentrated, {{it is not}} a {{commercial}} product. However, the corresponding sodium salt, <b>sodium</b> <b>chlorite,</b> NaClO2 is stable and inexpensive enough to be commercially available. The corresponding salts of heavy metals (Ag+, Hg+, Tl+, Pb2+, and also Cu2+ and NH4+) decompose explosively with heat or shock.|$|E
50|$|Mixing <b>sodium</b> <b>chlorite</b> {{solution}} {{with a weak}} food-grade {{acid solution}} (commonly citric acid), both stable, produces short-lived acidified <b>sodium</b> <b>chlorite</b> (ASC) which has potent decontaminating properties. Upon mixing the main active ingredient, chlorous acid is produced in equilibrium with chlorite anion. The proportion varies with pH, temperature, and other factors, ranging from approximately 5-35% chlorous acid with 65-95% chlorite; more acidic solutions result in {{a higher proportion of}} chlorous acid. Chlorous acid breaks down to chlorine dioxide which in turn breaks down to chlorite anion and ultimately chloride anion. ASC is used for sanitation of the hard surfaces which come in contact with food and as a wash or rinse for a variety of foods including red meat, poultry, seafood, fruits and vegetables. Because the oxo-chlorine compounds are unstable when properly prepared, there should be no measurable residue on food if treated appropriately. ASC also is used as a teat dip for control of mastitis in dairy cattle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>chlorite,</b> {{like many}} {{oxidizing}} agents, {{should be protected}} from inadvertent contamination by organic materials to avoid {{the formation of an}} explosive mixture. The chemical is highly stable in pure form and does not explode on percussive impact (unless organic contaminants are present, e.g. a greasy hammer striking the chemical on an anvil) and will also ignite if combined with a strong reducing agent.|$|E
