The setup is composed of a fading emulator, an anechoic chamber, and multiple probes.

These signals are synthesized {{by members of the}} LuxI family of proteins. To understand the mechanism of acyl-HSL synthesis we have purified the Pseudomonas aeruginosa RhlI protein and analyzed the kinetics of acyl-HSL synthesis by this enzyme. Purified RhlI catalyzes the synthesis of acyl-HSLs from acyl–acyl carrier proteins and S-adenosylmethionine. An analysis of the patterns of product inhibition indicated that RhlI catalyzes <b>signal</b> <b>synthesis</b> by a sequential, ordered reaction mechanism in which S-adenosylmethionine binds to RhlI as the initial step in the enzymatic mechanism.

A composite control strategy is proposed in this paper, which uses both local and non-local feedback channels to achieve enhanced damping and improved robustness. Special local signals and their non-local equivalents are identified for series reactive and shunt real power injection devices, which facilitate the design of controllers with a simple structure and fewer parameters.

40|$|Abstract—Silicon {{nanowire}} transistors with Schottky-barrier contacts exhibit both-type and-type characteristics under dif-ferent bias conditions. Polarity controllability {{of silicon}} nanowire transistors has been further demonstrated {{by using an}} additional polarity gate. The device can be configured as-type or-type by controlling the polarity gate voltage. This paper extends this ap-proach by using three independent gates and shows its interest to implement dual-threshold-voltage configurable circuits. Polarity and threshold voltage of uncommitted devices are determined by applying different bias patterns to the three gates. Uncommitted logic gates can thus be configured to implement different logic functions, targeting either high-performance or low-leakage applications. Dual-threshold-voltage design is thereby achievable {{through the use of}} a wiring scheme on an uncommitted pattern. With the polarity controllability of the three-independent-gate device, a range of logic functions is also obtained by replacing and GND by complementary input <b>signals.</b> <b>Synthesis</b> results of ISCAS’ 85 and VTR sequential benchmark circuits with these devices show, before place and route, comparable performance and 51 % reduction of leakage power consumption compared to 22 -nm low-standby-power FinFET technology.

Stronger market signals generally led to intensification and/or expansion of agriculture or increased non-farm labor, while changes in agents’ risk attitudes prompted heterogeneous local responses to global market signals.
