Aim: To calculate indirect cost and thus total cost per sample of various tests at Hematopathology laboratory (HPL) Settings and Design: Activity-based costing (ABC) method {{is used to}} calculate per cost test of the hematopathology laboratory. Material and Methods: Information is collected from registers, purchase orders, annual maintenance contracts (AMCs), payrolls, account books, hospital bills and registers along with informal interviews with hospital staff. Results: Cost per test decreases as total number of samples increases. Maximum annual expense at the HPL is on <b>reagents</b> and <b>consumables</b> followed by manpower. Cost per test is higher for specialized tests which interpret morphological or flow data and are done by a pathologist.

Both assays yielded good correlation of quantitative results (r = 0. 95) among clinical specimens, with a mean difference of − 0. 34 log 10 copies/ml. Testing of healthy donor plasma specimens yielded “target not detected” results by ART, with “HIV- 1 RNA detected, < 40 copies/ml” results for 3. 3 % (3 of 90 samples) of these specimens by CTM. Both the m 2000 sp/m 2000 rt (ART) and docked CAP/CTM 96 (CTM) instrument systems were capable of operating with continuous, uninterrupted workflow. When daily maintenance and cleaning were included, ART and CTM run durations (5 h 52 min and 6 h 4 min, respectively) and hands-on times (53 min and 46 min, respectively) were similar for a run batch size of 24. While ART was more flexible in terms of run batch size, CTM required fewer user interventions and consistently produced higher specimen throughput rates at 8, 16, and 24 h.

Objectives:  To validate a new, commercially available multiplex female array produced by Quansys Biosciences against individual immunoassays for the quantification of six hormones in urine samples from women in different reproductive stages. Methods:  Urine samples were analyzed using the new Quansys multiplex female hormone array and compared with well‐established individual immunoassays for adiponectin, free cortisol, c‐peptide, estrone‐ 3 ‐glucuronide (E 1 G), follicle stimulating hormone beta‐subunit (FSH‐beta), and human chorionic gonadotropin beta‐subunit (hCG‐beta). Correlations between assays were assessed using Pearson correlation, linear regression and Bland–Altman analysis. The temporal profiles of free cortisol, E 1 G, FSH‐beta, and hCG‐beta were also compared. Results:  The multiplex array was highly correlated with the individual immunoassays for five of the tested hormones (Pearson's correlation coefficient ≥ 0. 75), and yielded temporal patterns of hormone profiles consistent with the individual immunoassays for free cortisol, E 1 G, FSH‐beta, and hCG‐beta. Conclusions:   The Quansys multiplex female hormone array is a valid alternative method to individual immunoassays for the quantification of stress, reproductive and energetic hormones and metabolites in human urine samples {{and can be used}} to examine the dynamic interactions between these hormones.

Our participation in external quality assessment (EQA), specially with EMQN, gave {{us the opportunity to}} improve the reports of our genetic tests, to compare our performance/scores with other European laboratories, and to be permanently updated with the most recent recommendations for best practice in human molecular diagnosis. Since 2005, our lab has been participating in the EMQN external quality assessment program for the molecular diagnosis of hereditary haemochromatosis HFE-associated (HH-HFE). Since then, our score regarding the genotyping category has achieved every year the highest marks (2. 0), while for the interpretation category, in two years, the mean score was 1. 75. These scores lead us to improve the “interpretation section” of our reports in order to give the best result to the physicians and patients. In addition of a correct genotyping, the report “interpretation section” is particularly important, it should include the main suggestions for the best patient’s clinical management: i) immediate impact of the result for the patient, ii) patient’s clinical follow-up and other diagnostic options, iii) long term-impact (specially in predictive tests), iv) relevance of the result for relatives and, v) recommendations of genetic counselling. In accordance with OCDE disease specific guidelines for quality assurance in molecular genetic testing, and with the requirements of ISO 15189, in 2014 we were the first Portuguese laboratory accredited by IPAC, for HH-HFE - variants p.

Accreditation under the International Standard ISO 15189 is challenging but contributes to introduce improvements in our current practice because it comprises “management requirements” (e. g. quality management system, external services and supplies, preventive and corrective actions, control of records) and “technical requirements” (e. g. accommodation and environmental conditions, laboratory equipment, <b>reagents</b> and <b>consumables,</b> training and qualifications of personnel, examination processes, results reporting).

Due to all these factors, readings of glucose concentration by PBGMs may differ from those of chemistry analysers, and this should be taken into account when shifting from one method to the other. Furthermore, because the results depend on the PBGM, the same device should be used and all measurements should be made under the same environmental conditions and using the same blood sampling technique for serial measurements of blood glucose to be comparable.

This will be accomplished with a device about the size of a paperback novel capable of maneuvering, heating and cooling microliter-scale quantities of liquid on a Printed Circuit Board treated to be highly-water repellent. The individual articulation of droplets will be accomplished utilizing a phenomenon of altering the interface between droplets and the hydrophobic surface. The effective automation and volume reduction of a PCR thermocycler of the proposed project opens up the technique for formerly precluded applications, such as rural or third-world medical diagnosis and field usage. In addition, person-hours and total reagents used in a traditional bench-top PCR assay will be reduced. This project entails a fair number of uncertainties that will be experimentally investigated. Project planning and management include stages to determine certain characteristics and capabilities of the device that will influence the final design...|$|R
40|$|Bacteria {{can exist}} as planktonic, the {{lifestyle}} in which single cells exist in suspension, and as biofilms, which are surface-attached bacterial communities {{embedded in a}} selfproduced matrix. Most of the antibiotics and the methods for antimicrobial work {{have been developed for}} planktonic bacteria. However, the majority of the bacteria in natural habitats live as biofilms. Biofilms develop dauntingly fast high resistance towards conventional antibacterial treatments and thus, there is a great need {{to meet the demands of}} effective anti-biofilm therapy. In this thesis project it was attempted to fill the void of anti-biofilm screening methods by developing a platform of assays that evaluate the effect that screened compounds have on the total biomass, viability and the extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) layer of the biofilms. Additionally, a new method for studying biofilms and their interactions with compounds in a continuous flow system was developed using capillary electrochromatography (CEC). The screening platform was utilized with a screening campaign using a small library of cinchona alkaloids. The assays were optimized to be statistically robust enough for screening. The first assay, based on crystal violet staining, measures total biofilm biomass, and it was automated using a liquid handling workstation to decrease the manual workload and signal variation. The second assay, based on resazurin staining, measures viability of the biofilm, and it was thoroughly optimized for the strain used, but was then a very simple and fast method to be used for primary screening. The fluorescent resazurin probe is not toxic to the biofilms. In fact, it was also shown in this project that staining the biofilms with resazurin prior to staining with crystal violet had no effect on the latter and they can be used in sequence on the same screening plate. This sequential addition step was indeed a major improvement on the use of <b>reagents</b> and <b>consumables</b> and also shortened the work time. As a third assay in the platform a wheat germ agglutinin based assay was added to evaluate the effect a compound has on the EPS layer. Using this assay it was found that even if compounds might have clear effect on both biomass and viability, the EPS layer can be left untouched or even be increased. This is a clear implication of the importance of using several assays to be able to find “true hits” in a screening setting. In the pilot study of screening for antimicrobial and anti-biofilm effects using a cinchona alkaloid library, one compound was found to have antimicrobial effect against planktonic bacteria and prevent biofilm formation at low micromolar concentration. To eradicate biofilms, a higher concentration was needed. It was also shown that the chemical space occupied by the active compound was slightly different than the rest of the cinchona alkaloids as well as the rest of the compounds used for validatory screening during the optimization processes of the separate assays...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} tiered {{service delivery}} model (ITSDM) {{has been proposed}} to provide 'full-coverage' of CD 4 services throughout South Africa. Five tiers are described, defined by testing volumes and number of referring health-facilities. These include: (1) Tier- 1 /decentralized point-of-care service (POC) in a single site; Tier- 2 /POC-hub servicing processing 600 samples/day and serving > 100 or > 200 health-clinics, respectively. The objective {{of this study was}} to establish costs of existing and ITSDM-tiers 1, 2 and 3 in a remote, under-serviced district in South Africa. Historical health-facility workload volumes from the Pixley-ka-Seme district, and the total volumes of CD 4 tests performed by the adjacent district referral CD 4 laboratories, linked to locations of all referring clinics and related laboratory-to-result turn-around time (LTR-TAT) data, were extracted from the NHLS Corporate-Data-Warehouse for the period April- 2012 to March- 2013. Tiers were costed separately (as a cost-per-result) including equipment, staffing, <b>reagents</b> and test <b>consumable</b> costs. A one-way sensitivity analyses provided for changes in reagent price, test volumes and personnel time. The lowest cost-per-result was noted for the existing laboratory-based Tiers- 4 and 5 ($ 6. 24 and $ 5. 37 respectively), but with related increased LTR-TAT of > 24 - 48 hours. Full service coverage with TAT < 6 -hours could be achieved with placement of twenty-seven Tier- 1 /POC or eight Tier- 2 /POC-hubs, at a cost-per-result of $ 32. 32 and $ 15. 88 respectively. A single district Tier- 3 laboratory also ensured 'full service coverage' and < 24 hour LTR-TAT for the district at $ 7. 42 per-test. Implementing a single Tier- 3 /community laboratory to extend and improve delivery of services in Pixley-ka-Seme, with an estimated local ∼ 12 - 24 -hour LTR-TAT, is ∼ $ 2 more than existing referred services per-test, but 2 - 4 fold cheaper than implementing eight Tier- 2 /POC-hubs or providing twenty-seven Tier- 1 /POCT CD 4 services...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} the molten oxide electrolysis (MOE) process for the extraction of oxygen for life support and propellant, and silicon and metallic elements for use in fabrication on the Moon. The Moon is rich in mineral resources, but it is almost devoid of chemical reducing agents, therefore, molten oxide electrolysis is ideal for extraction, since the electron is the only practical reducing agent. MOE has several advantages over other extraction methods. First, electrolytic processing offers uncommon versatility in its insensitivity to feedstock composition. Secondly, oxide melts boast the twin key attributes of highest solubilizing capacity for regolith and lowest volatility of any candidate electrolytes. The former is critical in ensuring high productivity since cell current is limited by reactant solubility, while the latter simplifies cell design by obviating the need for a gas-tight reactor to contain evaporation losses as would be the case with a gas or liquid phase fluoride reagent operating at such high temperatures. Alternatively, MOE requires no import of <b>consumable</b> <b>reagents</b> (e. g. fluorine and carbon) as other processes do, and does not rely on interfacing multiple processes to obtain refined products. Electrolytic processing has the advantage of selectivity of reaction {{in the presence of a}} multi-component feed. Products from lunar regolith can be extracted in sequence according to the stabilities of their oxides as expressed by the values of the free energy of oxide formation (e. g. chromium, manganese, Fe, Si, Ti, Al, magnesium, and calcium). Previous work has demonstrated the viability of producing Fe and oxygen from oxide mixtures similar in composition to lunar regolith by molten oxide electrolysis (electrowinning), also called magma electrolysis having shown electrolytic extraction of Si from regolith simulant. This paper describes recent advances in demonstrating the MOE process by a joint project with participation by NASA KSC and MSFC, and Ohio State University and MIT. Progress in measuring cell efficiency for oxygen production, development of non reacting electrodes, and cell feeding and withdrawal will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{extraction}} and use {{of resources}} on the Moon, known as In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), can potentially reduce the cost and risk of human lunar exploration while also increasing science achieved. By not having to bring all of the shielding and mission consumables from Earth {{and being able to}} make products on the Moon, missions may require less mass to accomplish the same objectives, carry more science equipment, go to more sites of exploration, and/or provide options to recover from failures not possible with delivery of spares and consumables from Earth alone. The concept of lunar ISRU has been considered and studied for decades, and scientists and engineers were theorizing and even testing concepts for how to extract oxygen from lunar soil even before the Apollo 11 mission to the Moon. There are four main areas where ISRU can significantly impact how human missions to the Moon will be performed: mission consumable production, civil engineering and construction, energy production, storage, and transfer, and manufacturing and repair. The area that has the greatest impact on mission mass, hardware design and selection, and mission architecture is mission consumable production, in particular, the ability to make propellants, life support consumables, and fuel cell <b>reagents.</b> Mission <b>consumable</b> production allows for refueling and reuse of spacecraft, increasing power production and storage, and increased capabilities and failure tolerance for crew life support. The other three areas allow for decreased mission risk due to radiation and plume damage, alternative power systems, and failure recover capabilities while also enabling infrastructure growth over Earth delivered assets. However, while lunar ISRU has significant potential for mass, cost, and risk reduction for human lunar missions, it has never been demonstrated before in space. To demonstrate that ISRU can meet mission needs and to increase confidence in incorporating ISRU capabilities into mission architectures, terrestrial laboratory and analog field testing along with robotic precursor missions are required. A stepwise approach with international collaboration is recommended. The first step is to understand the resources available through orbital and surface exploration missions. Resources of particular interest are hydrogen, hydroxyl, water, and other polar volatile resources recently measured by Chandrayaan, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), and the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS). The second step is to demonstrate critical aspects of ISRU systems to prove ISRU is feasible under lunar environmental and resource conditions (ex. subscale oxygen extraction from regolith). The third step is to perform integrated missions with ISRU and other connected systems, such as power, consumable storage, surface mobility, and life support at a relevant mission scale to demonstrate ISRU capabilities as well as the critical interfaces with other exploration systems. If possible, the mission should demonstrate the use of ISRU products (ex. in a rocket engine or fuel cell). This dress rehearsal mission would be the final step before full implementation of ISRU into human missions, and may be performed during human lunar exploration activities. This stepwise approach is the most conservative approach, and may only be possible with international cooperation due to the limited number of robotic missions each nation/space agency can perform within their budget...|$|R
