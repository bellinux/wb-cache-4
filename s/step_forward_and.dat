Shane screams that walkers are not people and shoots one of the captive walkers before breaking the locks off the barn doors. Walkers start to file out, and Shane, Andrea, T-Dog (IronE Singleton), Daryl, and Glenn execute the zombies while the others watch. At the last moment, Sophia (Madison Lintz) emerges from the barn, dead and zombified. The group is paralyzed with shock and sadness, unable to act as Sophia walks towards them. Only Rick is able to <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> shoot her.|$|E
5|$|The Comet {{is widely}} {{regarded}} both as an adventurous <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> a supreme tragedy; nevertheless, the aircraft's legacy does include numerous advances in aircraft design and in accident investigations. The inquiries into the accidents that plagued the Comet 1 were {{perhaps some of the}} most extensive and revolutionary that have ever taken place, establishing precedents in accident investigation; many of the deep-sea salvage and aircraft reconstruction techniques employed have remained in use within the aviation industry. In spite of the Comet being subjected to what was then the most rigorous testing of any contemporary airliner, pressurisation and the dynamic stresses involved were not thoroughly understood {{at the time of the}} aircraft's development, nor was the concept of metal fatigue. While these lessons could be implemented on the drawing board for future aircraft, corrections could only be retroactively applied to the Comet.|$|E

25|$|First, {{the townspeople}} would be {{gathered}} in a public place. Although attendance was voluntary, those who failed to show would automatically be suspect, so most would come.

As part of this bargain they would need to inform on other heretics.|$|E
25|$|The two-handed pass is {{sometimes}} called a chest-pass. It is executed by holding the ball at chest height with the passer having their elbows bent next to the body at chest height. The passer then moves the ball forward, extending their elbows forward while they <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> release the ball. The purpose of the two-handed pass is to accurately deliver the ball to another player who is in motion. It is used because it ensures accuracy, both for long and short distances.|$|E

25|$|Hedwig {{grows more}} erratic and {{unstable}} {{as the evening}} progresses, until she finally breaks down, stripping off her wig, dress, and make-up, forcing Yitzhak to <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> sing ("Hedwig's Lament"/"Exquisite Corpse"). At the height of her breakdown, she seems to transform into Tommy Gnosis, who both begs for and offers forgiveness in a reprise of the song she wrote for him ("Wicked Little Town (Reprise)"). Hedwig, out of costume, finds acceptance within herself, giving her wig to Yitzhak. At peace, Hedwig departs the stage as Yitzhak takes over her final song, dressed fabulously in drag ("Midnight Radio").|$|E
25|$|The {{apparent}} lack {{of reaction}} by numerous neighbors purported to have watched the scene or to have heard Genovese's cries for help, although erroneously reported, prompted research into diffusion of responsibility and the bystander effect. Social psychologists John M. Darley and Bibb Latané started this line of research, showing that contrary to common expectations, larger numbers of bystanders decrease the likelihood that someone will <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> help a victim. The reasons include the fact that onlookers see that others are not helping either, that onlookers believe others will know better how to help, and that onlookers feel uncertain about helping while others are watching. The Genovese case thus became a classic feature of social psychology textbooks.|$|E
25|$|Government {{repression}} of political dissent has dropped sharply since the mid-1990s. The previous decades are sometimes {{described as the}} Years of Lead (Les Années de Plomb), and included forced disappearances, killings of government opponents and secret internment camps such as Tazmamart. To examine the abuses committed {{during the reign of}} King Hassan II (1961–1999), the government has set up an Equity and Reconciliation Commission (IER), which is to rehabilitate the victims, and pay compensation for state outrages against them. This has been hailed internationally as a big <b>step</b> <b>forward,</b> <b>and</b> an example to the Arab world. However, the IER has also come under attack from parts of the human rights-community, since its mission was not to reveal the identities of or prosecute human rights offenders, which most of the victims were requesting.|$|E

500|$|In 2009, Idaho gubernatorial {{candidate}} Rex Rammell {{announced plans to}} hold {{a series of meetings}} with believing Mormon men, which were to include discussion of the White Horse Prophecy. [...] In response, LDS Church officials issued a statement saying the church is [...] "politically neutral" [...] and hoping that [...] "the campaign practices of political candidates would not suggest that their candidacy is supported by or connected to the church." [...] Rammell later retracted his original plan to limit his meetings only to LDS men, apologizing to [...] "all those citizens who are not members of the LDS faith, who have expressed a sincere interest in attending my meetings and discussing this prophecy and how we can <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> save the United States Constitution".|$|E
500|$|Lilienthal {{had made}} [...] "whirling arm" [...] tests on {{only a few}} wing shapes, and the Wrights mistakenly assumed the data would apply to their wings, which had a {{different}} shape. The Wrights took a huge <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> made basic wind tunnel tests on 200 wings of many shapes and airfoil curves, followed by detailed tests on 38 of them. The tests, according to biographer Fred Howard, [...] "were the most crucial and fruitful aeronautical experiments ever conducted in so short a time with so few materials and at so little expense". An important discovery was the benefit of longer narrower wings: in aeronautical terms, wings with a larger aspect ratio (wingspan divided by chord—the wing's front-to-back dimension). Such shapes offered much better lift-to-drag ratio than the broader wings the brothers had tried so far.|$|E
500|$|After Lwaxana and Timicin {{spend an}} evening together, {{he tries to}} explain the custom of the Resolution. [...] He tells her that a fixed age had to be {{selected}} by the Kaelons because just randomly choosing a time to die would be heartless. Lwaxana finds the practice barbaric and refuses to accept the Kaelon tradition. [...] She tells Timicin how a Betazed woman on her planet successfully fought the tradition of wearing ornate wigs that contained live, captive birds. [...] It only took one courageous woman to <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> end this cruel tradition. [...] Lwaxana also compares Timicin's plans to end his life with his research to save his star. If it is Timicin's time to die, Lwaxana argues, perhaps it is also time for his star to die as well, so why should he {{continue to try to}} prevent it? Timicin thinks about what Lwaxana has told him.|$|E

500|$|As Somerset {{was content}} to stand and let his foes come to him, the opening move of the battle {{was made by the}} Yorkists. [...] Noticing the {{direction}} and strength of the wind, Fauconberg ordered all Yorkist archers to <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> unleash a volley of their arrows from what would be the standard maximum range of their longbows. With the wind behind them, the Yorkist missiles travelled farther than usual, plunging deep into the masses of soldiers on the hill slope. The response from the Lancastrian archers was ineffective as the heavy wind blew snow in their faces. They found it difficult to judge the range and pick out their targets and their arrows fell short of the Yorkist ranks; Fauconberg had ordered his men to retreat after loosing one volley, thus avoiding any casualties. Unable to observe their results, the Lancastrians loosed their arrows until most had been used, leaving a thick, prickly carpet in {{the ground in front of}} the Yorkists.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Shaunna Murphy was {{a little}} more {{critical}} of the episode, though she did call it [...] "game-changing." [...] Noting that it [...] "felt rushed," [...] she [...] "would have preferred a slow-burning mystery spread out over several episodes over this dramatic, Nikki and Paulo-style stand-alone sendoff." [...] Murphy however concluded that Graham's death was [...] "one of the coolest sequences we've seen so far on this show." [...] The A.V. Club columnist Oliver Sava graded [...] "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" [...] with a C. He also noted negative similarities to the television series Lost, explaining, [...] "Remember when Jack, Sawyer, and Kate were stuck in the polar-bear cages, and the plot just wandered in an aimless haze? The time when a bunch of viewers started jumping off because the writers kept adding questions without ever giving answers? What took Lost 44 episodes, OUAT has done in seven." [...] Unlike other reviewers, Sava called the ending a [...] "frustrating conclusion," [...] and believed that [...] "Horowitz and Kitsis [...] one <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> two steps back with this development." ...|$|E
500|$|Daniel Montesinos-Donaghy of Den of Geek stated [...] "After the {{excellent}} pilot episode, 'Day One' {{is both a}} <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> a step backward. As silly as {{the idea of a}} nymphomaniac extra-terrestrial gas is, the cast throw themselves into it with aplomb, quipping their way to the relatively gripping conclusion." [...] Patrick Holm of Total Sci-Fi felt that the second episode [...] "equates the word 'adult' with sex and swearing – more of a playground definition than a serious drama. In the conclusion of his review, Jonathan Capps of Noise to Signal felt that the episode was [...] "certainly nothing to get excited about, but I think it won't be too indicative of later episodes, as we're still getting to know these characters, and that has to take the fore in the first few episodes. However, Chris' [...] painfully simplistic, heavy-handed and often clichéd interpretation of sci-fi (some of Jack's techno-babble is frankly embarrassing) could prove to be a worrying factor later in the series." [...] A reviewer of TV Fodder felt [...] "Day One" [...] was a [...] "great second episode", adding [...] "there doesn't seem to be anything I don't like about this show".|$|E

5000|$|In Pakistan, a {{variation}} that uses two dice allows backwards movement. The dice are rolled and the die values {{can be used}} independently or in combination to move two pieces or a single piece forwards or backwards or both. For example, if the roll gives 1 and 4, the player can move a single piece 4 <b>steps</b> <b>forwards</b> <b>and</b> then 1 <b>step</b> backwards, or 1 <b>step</b> <b>forwards</b> <b>and</b> 4 <b>steps</b> backwards, or 1 then 4 <b>steps</b> <b>forwards</b> or backwards. Or the player can move a piece 1 <b>step</b> <b>forwards</b> or backwards, <b>and</b> another piece 4 <b>steps</b> <b>forwards</b> or backwards.|$|R
500|$|In October 2013, Nye began soliciting {{donations}} for {{the purchase}} of Angkor I, which was scheduled to return to the gallery unless $55,000 could be raised by 5pm on November 1, 2013. Two weeks prior to this deadline, the council had raised $31,750, more than $20,000 short of the asking price. In an interview published by The Oregonian, Nye said, [...] "Lee Kelly is a living legend and the pride of Oregon's artistic community. And his studio is right here in Clackamas County. He's a local treasure." [...] She also wrote in a press release, [...] "It would be a terrible loss to the community to have this sculpture removed, but it's fast becoming a reality". The council's board chair, Shari Newman, also stressed the urgent need for financial assistance, saying [...] "We’re more than halfway there, but what we really need is a handful of lead donors to <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> make this important work a permanent part of the City’s collection. And we need them now." [...] During the final two weeks of the fundraising campaign, the council draped a black parachute over the sculpture and posted signs requesting financial assistance, such as [...] "Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, this sculpture is leaving... Let's hope it's not." ...|$|E
500|$|The King's Company {{was forced}} with some {{reluctance}} to commission the technically advanced and expensive Theatre Royal playhouse {{by the success}} of the rival Duke's Company, which was drawing fascinated crowds with their [...] "moveable" [...] or [...] "changeable" [...] scenery and visually gorgeous productions at the former Lisle's Tennis Court at Lincoln's Inn Fields. Imitating the innovations at Lincoln's Inn Fields, the Theatre Royal also featured moveable scenery with wings or shutters that could be smoothly changed between or even within acts. When not in use, the shutters rested out of sight behind the sides of the proscenium arch, which also served as a visual frame for the on-stage happenings. The picture-frame-like separation between audience and performance was a new phenomenon in English theatre, though it had been found on the Continent earlier. However, theatre design in London remained ambivalent about the merits of the [...] "picture-box" [...] stage, and for many decades to come, London theatres including Drury Lane had large forestages protruding beyond the arch, often including the thrust stages found in the Elizabethan theatres. The players could still <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> bridge the distance between performer and audience, and in addition, it was not unusual for audience members to mount the stage themselves.|$|E
500|$|A few of {{the holders}} of Wentworth grants were {{originally}} from northwestern Connecticut; and some of them, including Remember Baker and Seth Warner, were relatives of Allen. In 1770, a group of Wentworth grant holders asked Allen to defend their case before New York's Supreme Court, a move that presented Allen with his first big stage. This move to leadership was not unusual; he was known among his contemporaries {{to be willing to}} <b>step</b> <b>forward</b> <b>and</b> take control. The trial, for which Allen hired Jared Ingersoll to represent the grantholder interest, began in July 1770, pitting Allen against politically powerful New York grant-holders, including New York's Lieutenant Governor Colden, James Duane (who was prosecuting the case), and Robert Livingston, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court (who was presiding over the case). The trial was brief, and the outcome unsurprising, as the court, citing their fraudulently issued nature, refused to allow the introduction of Wentworth's grants as evidence. Before departing for Bennington with the news, Allen was visited by Duane, who offered Allen payments which Duane described in his diary as payment [...] "for going among the people to quiet them". Allen denied taking any money; even if he did, none of his actions appeared to honor Duane's request. According to Allen's account he was outraged, and left his visitors with veiled threats, indicating that attempts to enforce the judgment would be met with resistance.|$|E
