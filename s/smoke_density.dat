With formulations containing aluminium diethyl phosphinate, the highest requirement of 600 V (numeric value of the highest voltage at which an electrical insulating material withstands 50 drops of electrolytic test solution) is achieved. Further benefits of polyamides and polyesters containing aluminium diethyl phosphinate are low <b>smoke</b> <b>density</b> which makes them suitable for rolling stock applications to EN 45545, as well as good light stability which is needed for outdoor applications.|$|E

40|$|A {{program to}} assess the impact of smoke on digital Instrumentation and Control (I and C) safety systems began in 1994, funded by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission Office of Research. Digital I and C safety systems are likely {{replacements}} for today`s analog systems. The nuclear industry has little experience in qualifying digital electronics for critical systems, part of which is understanding system performance during plant fires. The results of tests evaluating the performance of digital circuits and chip technologies exposed to the various smoke and humidity conditions representative of cable fires are discussed. Tests results show that low to moderate <b>smoke</b> <b>densities</b> can cause intermittent failures of digital systems. Smoke increases leakage currents between biased contacts, leading to shorts. Chips with faster switching times, and thus higher output drive currents, are less sensitive to leakage currents and thus to smoke. Contact corrosion from acidic gases in smoke and inductance of stray capacitance are less important contributors to system upset. Transmission line coupling was increased because the smoke acted as a conductive layer between the lines. Permanent circuit damage was not obvious in the 24 hrs of circuit monitoring. Test results also show that polyurethane, parylene, and acrylic conformal coatings are more effective in protecting against smoke than epoxy or silicone. Common-sense mitigation measures are discussed.

This study analyzes HCW incineration trends during emergency situations and smoke from HCW incineration processes in Haiti. The study was prompted by the current arguments about the climate change and the growing health effects associated with BC emissions. The conceptual framework was based on both adverse health effects from BC emissions exposure and climate change potential of BC emissions. Therefore, {{the goal was to}} determine whether cardboard HCW sharps containers emit lower BC emissions to the atmosphere during the incineration process, relative to the plastic sharps containers, and the pattern of emergency HCW incineration before and after the 2010 earthquake and cholera emergencies in Haiti.

The heat release rate and fire reaction properties of thermoset matrix composites reinforced with combustible fibres (aramid, extended-chain polyethylene) or non-combustible fibres (glass, carbon) were determined over a range of heat flux levels using the oxygen consumption cone calorimeter technique. The fire reaction properties that were measured were time-to-ignition, <b>smoke</b> <b>density,</b> carbon monoxide yield, carbon dioxide yield, mass loss rate and total mass loss. It is discovered that these reaction properties (apart from ignition time) are linearly related to the heat release rate for composites containing non-combustible fibres.

40|$|Nuclear {{power plants}} are {{converting}} to digital {{instrumentation and control}} systems; however, the effects of abnormal environments such as fire and smoke on such systems are not known. There are no standard tests for smoke, but previous smoke exposure tests at Sandia National Laboratories have shown that digital communications can be temporarily interrupted during a smoke exposure. Another concern is the long-term corrosion of metals exposed to the acidic gases produced by a cable fire. This report documents measurements of basic functional circuits during and up to 1 day after exposure to smoke created by burning cable insulation. Printed wiring boards {{were exposed to the}} smoke in an enclosed chamber for 1 hour. For high-resistance circuits, the smoke lowered the resistance of the surface of the board and caused the circuits to short during the exposure. These circuits recovered after the smoke was vented. For low-resistance circuits, the smoke caused their resistance to increase slightly. A polyurethane conformal coating substantially reduced the effects of smoke. A high-speed digital circuit was unaffected. A second experiment on different logic chip technologies showed that the critical shunt resistance that would cause failure was dependent on the chip technology and that the components used in the smoke exposures were some of the most smoke tolerant. The <b>smoke</b> <b>densities</b> in these tests were high enough to cause changes in high impedance (resistance) circuits during exposure, but did not affect most of the other circuits.

An over all model of the automatic fire detection shall give the opportunity to simulated the process of fire detection including the fire, the fire sensor and the processing of the sensor signal. For the different parts of the over all model realisations exist. There are different types of fire models and models for fire sensors. But these are separate models. To allow the simulation of a fire sensor signal from the fire up to the response of the sensor the models have to be combined. One model to simulate fires is the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. This model is combined with a fire sensor model, that simulates the response of a fire sensor to a given fire situation, which is defined by the input parameters of the sensor model. For this combination an interface between the two models is build up. Inside this interface the output parameters of the fire model are converted to the necessary input parameters of the sensor model. In the first approach only smoke sensor are considered. For the simulation of the smoke development during a fire the fire model gives informations about the <b>smoke</b> mass <b>density</b> as results. The smoke sensor model needs informations about the size distribution of the smoke particles. So the different parameters have to be converted. Therefore mechanisms which influence the particle size distribution but not the <b>smoke</b> mass <b>density</b> have to be implemented in the interface.

These programs involved comparison of the response and alarm time of optical and ionization type smoke sensors to smoldering and flaming coal combustion in a smoke chamber. Coal combustion experiments conducted in the smoke chamber demonstrated that a CO concentration of 5 ppm above ambient corresponded to an optical density of 0. 022 m 1. For the four smoke sensors for which a continuous analog signal was available, a smoke sensor alarm {{was defined as the}} average background signal plus ten times the peak-to-peak noise. This alarm criterion resulted in the association of the alarm for three of the four sensors with a <b>smoke</b> optical <b>density</b> of 0. 022 m- 1. and 0. 033 m- 1 for the fourth smoke sensor. The smoke sensors used in the smoke chamber studies were incorporated into large scale diesel fuel fire experiments conducted under normal ventilation conditions in the Safety Research Coal Mine (SRCM) at the Pittsburgh Research Center.

The goal {{of this study was to}} estimate daily particulate matter (PM; PM 10 and PM 2. 5) concentrations at a zip-code level for southern California before, during and after the 2003 southern California wildfires. On average, heavy smoke from the fires increased PM 10 3 and PM 2. 5 concentration by 160 and 100 mu g m(- 3), respectively. Missing PM concentrations from the every 3 rd or 6 th day routine measurements or due to the incapacitation of monitors and/or stations by the fires were estimated based on (1) temporal profiles of continuous TEOM or BAM data at co-located or closely located sites; and (2) light extinction, meteorological conditions, and smoke information extracted from MODIS satellite images at a 250 m resolution. Light extinction coefficient, smoke, and relative humidity were the most important factors strongly associated with PM concentrations, especially PM 2. 5. Spatial interpolations of PM concentrations were performed using inverse distance weighting (IDW), kriging or cokriging methods for the non-fire periods. Kriging was not superior to IDW in many cases due to the small number of monitoring stations. Since the fire and smoke created highly heterogeneous pollution surfaces, typical IDW and kriging could not work during the fires. Polygons were created based on satellite images to represent each smoke-covered area under different <b>smoke</b> <b>densities.</b> Concentrations were assigned to each polygon using measured or valid estimated concentrations at the corresponding monitoring stations, or at other stations under similar smoke conditions. In summary, population-weighted PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations were 190 and 90 mu gm(- 3), and 125 and 75 mu g m(- 3) under heavy and light smoke conditions, respectively, in contrast to concentrations of 40 and 20 mu g m(- 3) for PM 10 and PM 2. 5, respectively, during the non-fire periods. The methodology we developed in this study is also applicable to other regions to a greater or lesser extent based on the availability of satellite, visibility and air quality data.
