40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate in detail the mineralogical soil composition in order to obtain a clearer picture of the extent to which it and the related pedogenetic process taking place in locations marked as solods on the R = 1 : 50, 000 soil map of the Vojvodina Province (Nejgebauer et al., 1971) correspond to the <b>solodization</b> process described in the literature. In the profiles of the soils we studied in the regions of western Bačka and southern Srem, illite was the dominant clay mineral, but some specific phenomena were also observed that from the pedogenetic point of view are typical of a soil type previously described in the literature (solod), namely the greater contribution of quartz, in the surface horizons of the total soil sample (which is indicative of clay mineral decomposition and destruction), the predominance of illite and kaolinite in the surface horizons of the clay fraction, and the fact that in the Bt,g horizon the kaolinite content decreased considerably and illuviation occurred of chlorite and vermiculite, two highly dispersive minerals from the smectite group...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Despite its importance, {{studies of}} {{mangrove}} soils are scarce, especially from a pedological perspective. The {{objective of this}} work was to study the genesis of soils in a mangrove environment in northeastern Brazil (Ilhéus, Bahia) through a morphological, physical, chemical and mineralogical characterization. All soils presented a sandy texture, which {{is related to the}} parent material (Quaternary sand deposits). The tidal flooding and resulting hydromorphic conditions is responsible for dominance of dark grey colors, and high organic matter contents (paludization process). As well as the high values of electrical conductivity (EC) and dominance of Na+ in the saturation extract (salinization and <b>solodization</b> processes, respectively). Contrastingly, the M 3 profile, with aninga (Montrichardia linifera) vegetation, a non-exclusive mangrove plant, showed colors with high chromas due to a lesser influence of tidal flooding. The pH values and the SO 4 =/Cl- ratios indicated the presence of sulfidic material and, thus, the occurrence of the sulfidization process. The soil organic matter fractionation evidenced the humin as the fraction with the highest content, probably because of removal of most soluble fractions due to tidal action. Similar to mangrove soils from southeast Brazil, the XRD analysis identified kaolinite, mica and expandable 2 : 1 minerals in the clay fraction...|$|E
