5|$|By {{repeated}} scanning, bats can mentally {{construct an}} accurate {{image of the}} environment in which they are moving and of their prey item. However, some species of moth have exploited this, such as the tiger moths which produces aposematic ultrasound <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> warn bats that they are chemically protected. Other moth species can produce <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> jam bat echolocation. Many moth species have a hearing organ called a tympanum, which responds to an incoming bat signal by causing the moth's flight muscles to twitch erratically, sending the moth into random evasive maneuvers.|$|E
5|$|The SCN {{projects}} {{to a set}} of areas in the hypothalamus, brainstem, and midbrain that are involved in implementing sleep-wake cycles. An important component of the system is the reticular formation, a group of neuron-clusters scattered diffusely through the core of the lower brain. Reticular neurons send <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> the thalamus, which in turn sends activity-level-controlling <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> every part of the cortex. Damage to the reticular formation can produce a permanent state of coma.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the beating of}} signal and idler waves, which have imbalanced <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratios, in a phase-sensitive parametric amplifier. Imbalanced <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratios are achieved in two ways; first by imbalanced noise loading; second by varying idler <b>to</b> <b>signal</b> input power ratio. In the case of imbalanced noise loading the phase-sensitive amplifier improved the <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratio from 3 to 6 dB, {{and in the case}} of varying idler <b>to</b> <b>signal</b> input power ratio, the <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratio improved from 3 to in excess of 20 dB...|$|R

Passive wake-up radios use passive diodes {{to build}} the {{envelope}} detector that rectifies the RF <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> the baseband <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> detect data.

5|$|Axons {{transmit}} <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> other neurons {{by means}} of specialized junctions called synapses. A single axon may make as many as several thousand synaptic connections with other cells. When an action potential, traveling along an axon, arrives at a synapse, it causes a chemical called a neurotransmitter to be released. The neurotransmitter binds to receptor molecules in the membrane of the target cell.|$|E
5|$|In the tropics, a {{plentiful}} {{supply of}} phytoplankton is continuously available for starfish larvae to feed on. Spawning {{takes place at}} any time of year, each species having its own characteristic breeding season. In temperate regions, the spring and summer brings an increase in food supplies. The first individual of a species to spawn may release a pheromone that serves to attract other starfish to aggregate and to release their gametes synchronously. In other species, a male and female may come together and form a pair. This behaviour is called pseudocopulation and the male climbs on top, placing his arms between those of the female. When she releases eggs into the water, he is induced to spawn. Starfish may use environmental <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> coordinate the time of spawning (day length to indicate the correct time of the year, dawn or dusk to indicate the correct time of day), and chemical <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> indicate their readiness to breed. In some species, mature females produce chemicals to attract sperm in the sea water.|$|E

50|$|The {{implication}} {{is that when the}} radar is noise limited the variation of <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratio is an inverse fourth power. Halving the distance will cause the <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratio to increase (improve) by a factor of 16. When the radar is volume clutter limited, however, the variation is an inverse square law and halving the distance will cause the <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> clutter to improve by only 4 times.|$|R
5|$|Mimicry {{occurs when}} an {{organism}} (the mimic) simulates signal properties of another organism (the model) to confuse a third organism. This {{results in the}} mimic gaining protection, food, and mating advantages. There are two classical types of defensive mimicry: Batesian and Müllerian.

5|$|The {{basal ganglia}} are {{a group of}} {{interconnected}} structures in the forebrain. The primary function of the basal ganglia appears to be action selection: they send inhibitory <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> {{all parts of the}} brain that can generate motor behaviors, and in the right circumstances can release the inhibition, so that the action-generating systems are able to execute their actions. Reward and punishment exert their most important neural effects by altering connections within the basal ganglia.|$|E

40|$|We {{test the}} IDL package EZ_Ages for {{validity}} on spectra with low <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratios.

40|$|The {{main idea}} {{of this paper is}} to propose an innovative,benchmarking tool based on genetic {{algorithm}} to evaluate robustness of visible and invisible watermarking techniques. Image fidelity metrics such as mean square error(MSE), <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratio(SNR),peak <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratio(PSNR), weighted peak <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratio(WPSNR) are being used. However, when large quantities of data are to be assessed, subjective metrics such as mean opinion score(MOS),signal <b>to</b> noise ratio(SNR),peak <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratio(PSNR) are not pragmatic since it needs experts and inordinate amount of time. PSNR and WPSNR are independent of human visual system(HVS) parameters and hence they are inappropriate scales to measure potential research results. This brings out a new image fidelity metric called Enhanced Weighted peak <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratio(EWPSNR) which is experimentally proven to be better than PSNR and WPSNR...|$|R

5|$|After the {{initiation}} of the strategic aerial bombardment of North Vietnam (Operation Rolling Thunder) in March 1965, Washington saw that program as its chief method of relaying <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> Hanoi to cease its support of the southern insurgency.

40|$|Abstract — The Ad-hoc {{wireless}} {{networks are}} assuming great importance {{because of the}} ease of operation and their operation without any infrastructure. On the other hand, {{it has its own}} characteristics like operation from low-capacity battery, frequent change of routing and connectivity etc [...] Bit Error Rate (BER) of any wireless data network is critically dependent on the <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise and distortion(SINAD) ratio or <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> noise ratio(SNR) or <b>signal</b> <b>to</b> interference ratio(SIR) parameters of a receiver. The degradation in receiver performance can be made up theoretically by boosting the transmitter power level but the maximum power level is also highly regulated. Consequently, solution by reducing the interference is more relevant for Ad-hoc nodes.

5|$|Chemical {{communications}} in animals {{rely on a}} variety of aspects including taste and smell. Chemoreception is the physiological response of a sense organ (i.e. taste or smell) to a chemical stimulus where the chemicals act as <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> regulate the state or activity of a cell. A semiochemical is a message-carrying chemical that is meant to attract, repel, and convey information. Types of semiochemicals include pheromones and kairomones. One example is the butterfly Phengaris arion which uses chemical signals as a form of mimicry to aid in predation.|$|E
5|$|Each sensory system {{begins with}} {{specialized}} receptor cells, such as light-receptive neurons in the retina of the eye, or vibration-sensitive neurons in the cochlea of the ear. The axons of sensory receptor cells travel into {{the spinal cord}} or brain, where they transmit their <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> a first-order sensory nucleus dedicated to one specific sensory modality. This primary sensory nucleus sends information to higher-order sensory areas that are dedicated to the same modality. Eventually, via a way-station in the thalamus, the signals are sent to the cerebral cortex, where they are processed to extract the relevant features, and integrated with signals coming from other sensory systems.|$|E
5|$|Fireflies use {{light to}} attract mates. Two systems are {{involved}} according to species; in one, females emit {{light from the}}ir abdomens to attract males; in the other, flying males emit <b>signals</b> <b>to</b> which the sometimes sedentary females respond. Click beetles emit an orange light from the abdomen when flying and a green light from the thorax when they are disturbed or moving about on the ground. The former is probably a sexual attractant but the latter may be defensive. Larvae of the click beetle Pyrophorus nyctophanus live in the surface layers of termite mounds in Brazil. They light up the mounds by emitting a bright greenish glow which attracts the flying insects on which they feed.|$|E
