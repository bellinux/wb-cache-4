40|$|When {{employment}} increases, a corres-ponding rise {{in hours}} worked can usuallybe expected. And indeed, from 1976 to 2000, changes in employment were fairly accurately reflected in hours worked. However, since 2000, this relationship has greatly diminished (Chart A). From 2000 to 2004, employment rose 8. 1 %, {{compared with only}} 4. 3 % for overall hours worked. Such a differen-tial is unprecedented. The robust employment growth was surprising. Lower growth in hours seemed more consistent with reduced economic growth in Canada and the <b>stagnation</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> in the United States. This contrast led some economists to question Cana-da’s exceptional employment record in recent years (RBC 2004). If employment is growing more rapidly than hours, then average hours per worker are declining. Accord-ing to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), average weekly hours actually worked declined for three consecutive years— 2001, 2002 and 2003 —before rising slightly in 2004. The decline fro...|$|E
40|$|The {{models of}} racial {{discrimination}} developed and the detailed empirical analysis of the post World War II U. S. economy {{are consistent with the}} two central hypotheses: (1) there is no dominant tendency within U. S. capitalism towards elimination {{of racial discrimination}}, and (2) until the late 19702 ̆ 7 s, public sector employment increased racial equality. ^ Neoclassical models of racial discrimination and related empirical studies are criticized: (1) for emphasizing one aspect of racial equality, earnings, while de-emphasizing unemployment because of the difficulty of integrating it into neoclassical theory; (2) for incorrectly theorizing production as a purely technical process resulting in a one-sided emphasis on market forces for racial equality while abstracting from tendencies that reproduce inequality; and (3) for failing to analyze the distinct behavior and outcomes between the public and private sector. Blacks are more likely than whites, and increasingly so, to work in the public sector, and their proportion <b>of</b> private sector <b>employment</b> is declining. ^ A social relations theory of production based on cooperation and conflicts among black employees, white employees and employers is constructed. The likely equilibrium is racial inequality in earnings and employment. Other results derived are that improvement in earnings by race decrease black <b>employment,</b> and growth <b>of</b> government <b>employment</b> or affirmative action causes black to white earnings and employment to increase. ^ The implications of the model are consistent with actual trends. It is demonstrated that black to white earnings grew until the mid 19702 ̆ 7 s for both men and women, and have been stationary since. Further the relation between black and white unemployment has substantially worsened since 1975. Both trends are shown to be statistically significant. A cause of the deterioration in the relation between black and white unemployment rates is the <b>stagnation</b> <b>of</b> government <b>employment.</b> ^ The study concludes with an analysis of present public policy. The author finds that current attacks on affirmative action and cutbacks in human services and public sector employment have halted progress towards racial equality and will increase inequality in earnings and unemployment between blacks and whites, and among blacks. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{consider}} {{the extent to}} which the <b>stagnation</b> <b>of</b> household consumption is responsible for the decade-long recession in Japan during the 1990 s and early 2000 s and the reasons for the <b>stagnation</b> <b>of</b> household consumption during this period and find that the <b>stagnation</b> <b>of</b> private investment (and inventory investment) rather than that of household consumption was the major cause of the decade-long recession, that household consumption was nonetheless relatively stagnant during this decade, and that the <b>stagnation</b> <b>of</b> household consumption was due primarily to the <b>stagnation</b> <b>of</b> household disposable income, the decline in household wealth (which in turn was due primarily to the collapse of land and equity prices), and to a lesser extent, increased uncertainty about the future (especially about old age in general and old-age pensions in particular), the deterioration of future prospects, and deflationary expectations concerning consumer prices. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{starting}} point for this article is the idea put forward by Gadrey (2008, 2010) that environmental problems and a policy of addressing them by introducing an environmental tax could trigger economic contraction and downscaling and a shrinking of the service sector in developed economies. The {{purpose of this article}} is to test these hypotheses using an evolutionary simulation model. To this end, we use a model of endogenous growth and structural change into which an environmental dimension is incorporated. The results of our simulations certainly reveal structural change within service industries but no change in the distribution <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> between services and manufacturing. Furthermore, we show that the environmentally desirable <b>stagnation</b> <b>of</b> labour productivity in the capital goods sector is compatible with a largely positive growth trend in the economy as a whole, with the development of knowledge-intensive business services apparently able partially to offset the <b>stagnation</b> <b>of</b> productivity in the capital goods sector. We conclude by emphasising the need for environmental innovation in service activities and casting doubt on the long-term effectiveness of an environmental tax in the fight against pollution...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{analyze the}} causes of the {{prolonged}} slowdown of the Japanese economy in the 1990 s and find that the <b>stagnation</b> <b>of</b> investment, especially private fixed investment, was the primary culprit. I then investigate the causes <b>of</b> the <b>stagnation</b> <b>of</b> household consumption during the 1990 s and find that the <b>stagnation</b> <b>of</b> household disposable income, the decline in household wealth, and increased uncertainty about the future are among the contributing factors. Finally, I consider whether demand side factors or supply side factors were more important as causes of the prolonged slowdown of the Japanese economy in the 1990 s and conclude that the former (especially misguided government policies) were probably more important. ...|$|R
30|$|Since the mid- 1990 s, {{the global}} growth engine of {{capitalism}} has remained stagnant {{for the past}} 20  years. The <b>stagnation</b> <b>of</b> economic growth is sometimes interpreted as {{a continuation of the}} aftermath of the global real estate bubble caused by the subprime mortgage crisis. However, the real estate bubble itself was caused by the structural distortion of capitalism, coming from the growth <b>stagnation</b> <b>of</b> capitalism for which the expected income rate of capital investment is very low. Thus, it is not proper to interpret that the current stagnant growth of capitalism is the aftermath of the subprime mortgage crisis. A theoretical and practical discussion to define and interpret the growth <b>stagnation</b> <b>of</b> capitalism around the world is necessary to guarantee an alternative in handling the problem.|$|R

40|$|Over {{recent decades}} some Latin American {{countries}} have experienced an important development {{due to the}} positive effect of tourism on the services sector. Our model relates tourism with the increase of Value-Added in services, taking into account other important variables which influence the evolution of this sector and explain the important differences among developed and less developed countries. Besides tourism, the industrial evolution is also very important to improve the development of services through some inter-sector relations. The model suggests that some <b>stagnation</b> <b>of</b> services development in many countries is due largely to a lack of industrial investment, specially in countries with a low level of tourism. Our main conclusions are that both factors, industry and tourism, need to be increased generally to contribute to development <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> and production <b>of</b> the services sector.. ...|$|R

Patients in the three groups were all treated for 2 weeks. Results: The total significant effective rates for IBS were 54. 1 %, 28. 8 % and 21. 9 % in the DGO-H, DGO-L, and placebo groups, and the total effective rates for the syndrome <b>of</b> <b>stagnation</b> <b>of</b> qi and cold were 54. 1 %, 25. 8 % and 23. 4 % in the three groups, respectively.
