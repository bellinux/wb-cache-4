40|$|Local {{patterns}} of seed regeneration and trade that occur outside the formal breeding sector (seed exchange networks) {{can have a}} strong influence on the genetic diversity and evolution of traditional crop varieties. Despite this, {{little is known about}} the extent to which seed exchange networks influence gene flow and genetic structure in traditional crop varieties. Here we study barley (Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare) in rural communes of Northern Morocco in 2008 and 2009. We quantified seed regeneration and exchange by farmers within the seed exchange network using structured interviews. Using SSR markers, we also quantified the neutral genetic diversity and structure of a complex of traditional varieties referred to as Beldi that is managed in this exchange network. The majority of farmers (> 88 %) report cultivating Beldi. Most seeds of Beldi (70 � 90 %) are maintained on-farm, while the remainder of seeds are obtained from local markets within the commune. Beldi has high genetic diversity and there is weak but significant genetic structure between communes (FST = 0. 031). From SSR marker data there is evidence of a high level of gene flow between communes not reported in interviews. Seeds purchased in local markets likely represent seeds from a larger geographic region, leading to lower genetic structure among communes than expected based on the reported level of on-farm seed regeneration and local <b>sourcing</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed.</b> We discuss the implications of this seed exchange network for the conservation of traditional barley varieties in the study region...|$|E

40|$|Red {{onion is}} one of the main horticultural {{commodities}} in Indonesia. Generally red onion is cultivated by using tuber as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds.</b> The weakness <b>of</b> the use of tuber as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds,</b> besides the high cost also the quality <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> is less well guaranteed because it almost always carries of the pathogen disease. To overcome the weakness of red onion cultivation with tuber, the alternative is the cultivation with the <b>seed</b> <b>of</b> botani (True <b>Seed</b> <b>of</b> Shallot/TSS). The weakness <b>of</b> botanical <b>seeds</b> as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> is the low germination/growing power. Therefore, to solve the problem of red onion cultivation with TSS, has been done research on the modification of growing medium and giving of plant growth regulator to produce <b>seeds</b> <b>of</b> red onion origin <b>of</b> botanical <b>seed</b> (TSS).

I briefly pointed out the positives and negatives of individual used methods, such as reclamation, that aims to restore the vegetation cover quickly, but is very expensive and species that appear on the reclaimed locations aren't nearly as rare, as those on locations that are left to natural succession. Natural succession has the best results if the location is in close vicinity to a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>seeds.</b> Reclaimed areas show a significantly lower biodiversity and hinder protection of rare and key species as opposed to natural succession. To avoid this, in some cases we can use smaller interventions instead of reclamation, and these interventions should be done as delicately as possible {{with the principles of}} natural succession in mind.

In 2008 Fiedler, Jedwab and Parker [5] used this viewpoint to show how to construct and enumerate all known 2 h-phase Golay sequences of length 2 m, starting from two <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> Golay <b>seed</b> pairs. The first <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> pairs is the trivial Golay pair of length 1, which gives rise to “standard” Golay sequences; the second source is the set of 512 non-standard “cross-over” 4 -phase Golay pairs of length 8, which give rise to non-standard 4 -phase Golay sequences of length 2 m for each m⩾ 4.

This {{study investigated the}} potential of larval culture as a sustainable <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>seed</b> stock by quantifying reproduction, larval metamorphosis, and juvenile survival and growth of C. matthewsi. The accuracy of using surface area (2 -dimensional) measurements {{as a proxy for}} juvenile growth was also assessed against volumetric (3 -dimensional) data. Coscinoderma matthewsi is gonochoric and releases parenchymellae larvae over several weeks, corresponding with increasing sea surface temperatures, over the Austral summer (26. 6 °C in November and 29. 1 °C in January). Sexual maturity is size dependent and smaller individuals (1267. 78 cm 3 ± 405. 66) were non-reproductive. There were no size differences between males and females and both sexes occur in equal proportions. Male reproductive output (ROI) (4. 33 % ± 0. 75) was higher than females (1. 62 % ± 0. 15). Larval metamorphic success was 98. 0 % ± 2 after 72 h post-release. Juvenile survival over seven months was independent of settlement density and ranged between 18 % and 30 %. Using surface area underestimated growth of juvenile sponges by approximately half in comparison to volume estimates.
