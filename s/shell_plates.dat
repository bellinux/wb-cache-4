25|$|Early {{molluscs}} {{appear to}} have grazed on microbial mats, so it is natural to hypothesize that grazing molluscs were also restricted to areas where the mats could survive. The earliest known fossils of monoplacophoran ("single-plated") molluscs date from the Early Cambrian, where they grazed on microbial mats. Most modern monoplacophorans live on soft subtrates in deep parts of the seas, although one genus lives on hard substrates {{at the edges of}} continental shelves. Modern monoplacophorans have less diverse shell forms than fossil genera. Unfortunately the oldest known fossils of polyplacophorans (molluscs with multiple <b>shell</b> <b>plates)</b> are from the Late Cambrian, when the substrate revolution had significantly changed marine environments. Since they are found with stromatolites (stubby pillars built by some types of microbial mat colony), it is thought that polyplacophorans grazed on microbial mats. Modern polyplacophorans mainly graze on mats on rocky coastlines, although a few live in the deep sea. No fossils have been found of aplacophorans (shell-less molluscs), which are generally regarded as the most primitive living molluscs. Some burrow into the sea-floors of deep waters, feeding on micro-organisms and detritus; others live on reefs and eat coral polyps.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{operculum}} {{is a novel}} {{structure in}} gastropod molluscs. Because the operculum shows notable similarities to the <b>shell</b> <b>plate,</b> we asked whether there were an evolutionary link between these two secretory organs. We found {{that some of the}} genes involved in shell-field development are expressed in the operculum, such as dpp and grainyhead, whereas engrailed and Hox 1 are not. Specific knockdown of dpp by injection of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) resulted in malformation of the <b>shell</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>shell</b> <b>plate</b> was smaller due to failure of activation of cell proliferation in the shell-field margin. The expressions of grainyhead and chitin synthase 1 in the shell field margin were suppressed by dpp-dsRNA. However, matrix secretion was not completely abolished, and the expressions of ferritin, engrailed or Hox 1 were not affected by dpp-dsRNA, indicating that dpp is partly involved in the developmental pathway for shell matrix secretion. We also present evidence that dpp performs a key role in operculum development. Indeed, dpp-dsRNA impaired matrix secretion in the operculum as well as expression of grainyhead. Based on these observations that dpp is important for development of both the <b>shell</b> <b>plate</b> and operculum, we conclude that co-option of dpp to the posterior part of the foot contributed to the innovation of the operculum in gastropods...|$|R

50|$|Most land slugs have, {{within the}} mantle, the {{remnants}} or residue of what was, in the evolutionary past, a larger external shell. In most slugs, this remnant {{takes the form}} either of a small internal shell (a thin shelly plate), or a collection of calcareous (chalky) granules. In this species there is an internal <b>shell</b> or <b>shell</b> <b>plate</b> which resembles that found in land slugs of the genus Limax. In other words, the <b>shell</b> <b>plate</b> in this species is oval in shape, solid, and chalky, with a transparent conchiolin (horny) base. The <b>shell</b> <b>plate</b> is usually somewhat convex above and concave beneath, with a few indistinct concentric lines of growth, and is covered outwardly with a very thin transparent periostracum (a protein layer), and with the nucleus (the oldest growth part) situated near the front. In young Kerry slugs the shell is very thin and convex, abruptly cut off behind, and with an extremely thin layer that projects in front and contains minute granules.|$|R

5000|$|Short and stubby icebreakers are {{generally}} built using transverse framing {{in which the}} <b>shell</b> <b>plating</b> is stiffened with frames placed about 400 to 1000 mm apart as opposed to longitudinal framing used in longer ships.

While the <b>shell</b> <b>plating,</b> which is {{in direct contact with}} the ice, can be up to 50 mm thick in older polar icebreakers, the use of high strength steel with yield strength up to [...] in modern icebreakers results in the same structural strength with smaller material thicknesses and lower steel weight.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} usage of {{floating}} frames in boats. A floating frame is a transverse frame fittedto the longitudinal stiffener flanges without contact with the <b>shell</b> <b>plating,</b> {{as opposed to the}} traditionalfixed frame which is welded to the <b>shell</b> <b>plating</b> with the stiffeners most commonly fitted through cut outsin the frame. To study the floating frame structure in a bigger perspective a finite element analysis is performed on amid ship compartment of an existing 60 m high speed catamaran ferry. The analysis is performed on amodel with scantlings as the original craft but with introduced floating frames. Stresses are analysed withrespect to maximum allowable stress as given in the DNV-rules for HAZ. High stresses are found {{in the bottom of the}} frames due to the reduced bending stiffness without effectiveflange from the <b>shell</b> <b>plating.</b> A large deformation in the <b>shell</b> <b>plating</b> relative the transverse frames isfound, creating high stresses in the stiffener webs. This deformation is induced by a large verticaldeformation of the frames. It is concluded that the transverse frames requires an increased stiffness to achieve acceptable stress levels. Possible solutions to increase stiffness are discussed, further studies are required to achieve an acceptablestructure. A design criterion for stiffeners in floating frame constructions is evaluated. The criterion considers theinteraction between a concentrated contact force and a bending moment with the purpose of simplifyingthe design process of stiffeners. The criterion is a combination of design methods from DNV HSLC andEurocode 9. The design criterion is found to give conservative results, although not unreasonably conservative. Thecriterion is suitable for the design of smaller work boats where the scantlings traditionally are not veryoptimized...|$|R
