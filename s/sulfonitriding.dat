40|$|Purpose: The main aim of {{the paper}} was to {{investigate}} the structure and properties of the surface layers of the C 45, 42 CrS 4, 42 CrMoS 4 steels after <b>sulfonitriding</b> at a temperature of 540 and 570 °C. The thickness of zones occurring in the sulphonitric layer was defined just as their chemical and phase composition and microhardness. Moreover, abrasion resistance in the zones of sulfonitrided layers was investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The following experimental techniques were used: light microscopy (LM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) method, Vickers microhardness, abrasion tests. Findings: Changes of microhardness in the zones of sulfonitrided layers have been presented. It has been stated that the surface layers of steels C 45, 41 CrS 4 and 42 CrMoS 4 after gas <b>sulfonitriding</b> at 570 °C are composed of four zones which are: external zone of sulfides with grain-like structure, zone of nitride phases with compound structure and with round sulfides precipitates, zone of nitride phases with diversified structure depending on chemical composition of the steel base of hardness 262 HV for steel 41 CrS 4 and 330 HV for steel 42 CrMoS 4, zone of nitride phases in the form of elongated precipitates in matrix of C 45 steel or diffusion zone of micro-hardness 500 - 700 HV at the distance of 100 - 110 mm from the surface of 41 CrS 4 and 42 CrMoS 4 steels. Research limitations/implications: Impossibility of microhardness measurement in the external zone of the sulfonitrided layer. Practical implications: <b>Sulfonitriding</b> is a process of termochemical treatment used for vehicle and device parts on a large scale. Originality/value: Varied morphology of zones of the upper layers revealed by the method of scanning electron microscopy...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} results of {{abrasive}} and adhesive wear resistance of selected grades of {{nodular cast iron}} with carbides are presented. It was demonstrated, that the maximum wear resistance has got nodular cast iron with the microstructure of upper bainite, lower bainite and carbides. This cast iron with hardened steel and <b>sulfonitrided</b> steel is the most advantageous friction pair during adhesive wear testing. It was found, that the least advantageous friction pair is pearlitic nodular cast iron with carbides and normalized steel...|$|R
40|$|The {{current work}} {{presents}} the research results of abrasion wear and adhesive wear at rubbing and liquid friction of new austenitic, austenitic-ferritic (“duplex”) cast steel and {{gray cast iron}} EN-GJL- 250, spheroidal graphite iron EN-GJS- 600 - 3, pearlitic with ledeburitic carbides and spheroidal graphite iron with ledeburitic carbides with a microstructure of the metal matrix: pearlitic, upper bainite, mixture of upper and lower bainite, martensitic with austenite, pearlitic-martensitic-bainitic-ausferritic obtained in the raw state. The wearing quality test was carried out on a specially designed and made bench. Resistance to abrasion wear was tested using sand paper P 40. Resistance to adhesive wear was tested in interaction with steel C 55 normalized, hardened and <b>sulfonitrided.</b> The liquid friction was obtained using CASTROL oil. It was stated that austenitic cast steel and “duplex ” are characterized by a similar value of abrasion wear and adhesive wear at rubbing friction. The smallest decrease in mass was shown by the cast steel in interaction with the <b>sulfonitrided</b> steel C 55. Austenitic cast steel and “duplex ” in different combinations of friction pairs have a higher wear quality than gray cast iron EN-GJL- 250 and spheroidal graphite iron EN-GJS- 600 - 3. Austenitic cast steel and “duplex ” are characterized by a lower wearing quality than the spheroidal graphite iron with bainitic-martensitic microstructure. In the adhesive wear test using CASTROL oil the tested cast steels an...|$|R
