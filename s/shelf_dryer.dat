40|$|Introduction. The wet {{granulation}} technique {{is often used}} {{in the preparation of}} free-flowing granules in the manufacture of tablets and capsules. It is very important that granules obtained by this technology be dried before further processing. And also, {{it is important that the}} method of drying is entirely controlled and managed and the result is quite predictable. In recent years, microwave drying of granules make a considerable interest. Microwave drying is especially useful for moisture sensitive materials which are mostly pharmaceutical substances. Microwave drying technology is useful for dosage forms with high purity, since this method provides the possibility of drying in the same container production, which reduces the chance of cross contamination of matter and its direct contact with staff. The aim of this work was to study the effect of microwave radiation on the technological properties of natural zeolite peets compared to traditional convection method and to determine the optimal drying modes and specific humidity of the material. Material & methods. Granules were prepared by {{wet granulation}} technology by using a laboratory granulator NG- 12. As the humidifier we used potato starch gel and PVP in an amount of 25 % by weight of the dry product. The resulting granules were divided into two equal parts and subjected to drying in a microwave oven (Delfa D 20 MW) of installed capacity (119 W, 280 W, 336 W, 462 W, ​​ 595 W and 700 W) and <b>shelf</b> <b>dryer</b> to a residual moisture level of 0. 01 g. w. /g. d. m. or less. Determination of the specific humidity of granules was carried out by mass loss on drying. Fractional composition of granules was determined using a standard set of sieves with the diameter of the holes 2. 0; 1. 0; 0. 5 and 0. 25 mm. The friability of the granules was determined using friabilator Pharma Test PTF 10 E / ER, Germany. To characterize the fluidity of granule Carr`s indicator (IC) and coefficient Hausnera (HR). Results & discussion. The results of experimental studies have shown a significant impact of intensity microwave radiation on the rate of drying material. With an increase in power from 119 watts to 700 watts time spent on drying decreased more than twice. Changing the speed of drying material took place in two periods. In the first period (humidity of 0, 29 - 0, 05 g. w. /g. d. m.) free moisture located mainly on the surface of the granules is removed in the first period, in the second period (0, 04 - 0, 05 g. w. /g. d. m.) moisture from the inner pores of the material is removed. Type of drying does not significantly affect the distribution of particle size. Different amounts of microwave radiation also not significantly affect the size and rheological properties of the granules. The last one was confirmed by values of Carr`s index and coefficient of Hausner. Both indicators showed that all series of obtained granules have very good flowability. Study of the influence of specific humidity values on the mechanical strength of granules and tablets obtained on the basis showed that its most optimal level, which can be recommended both for granules and for tablets, is based on their range of 0, 03 - 0, 05 g. w. /g. d. m. Knowing the limits of specific humidity allows to choose optimal modes of power microwave radiation for drying a natural zeolite granules. Conclusion. The effect of microwave radiation on the dynamics of natural zeolite pellets drying on the value of their technological properties. Optimal levels of specific humidity for granules and tablets, providing the best technological properties, is 0, 03 - 0, 05 g. w. /g. d. m. On the basis of data obtained, the reasonable duration of the process of drying, depending on the power of the microwave radiation, is 3 - 14 minutes...|$|E

40|$|Freeze-drying {{is often}} used in {{manufacture}} of pharmaceuticals to remove a solvent {{in such a way}} that the sensitive molecular structure of the active substance of a drug is least disturbed, and to provide a sterile powder that can be quickly and completely rehydrated. In this work heat transfer rates in a laboratory-scale freeze-dryer have been measured to investigate the contribution of different heat transfer modes. Pure water was partially dried under low-pressure conditions and sublimation rates were determined gravimetrically. The heat transfer rates were observed to be independent of the separation distance between a product vial and a <b>dryer</b> <b>shelf</b> and linearly dependent on the pressure in the free molecular limit. However, under higher pressures the heat transfer rates were independent of pressure and inversely proportional to the separation distance. Previous heat transfer studies in conventional freeze-drying cycles have attributed a dominant portion of the total heat transfer to radiation, the rest to conduction, whereas the convection has been found insignificant. While the measurements revealed the significance of the radiative and gas conduction components, the convective component was found to be comparable to the gas conduction contribution at pressures greater than 100 mTorr. The current investigation suggests that the convective component of the heat transfer cannot be ignored at typical laboratory-scale freeze-drying conditions...|$|R
40|$|Rack solar drier is {{one example}} of useful {{utilization}} of solar energy, but has not widely used by the public, yet. Using this solar drier we can dry our fish and agricultural products without fossil fuels. Solar dryer works by absorbing sunlight by four blackened flat collectors, and the heat generated by the collectors was transferred by air flow to the plenum chamber and drying chamber consisting of <b>shelves.</b> The solar <b>dryer</b> used in this experiment has dimension of 4, 66 m length by 4, 66 m width and by 1, 95 m height. The dryer has a capacity of around 50 kg materials that can be dried during 20 hours. Based on our testing it was observed that the decrease in water level was not uniform among the shelves position. The final moisture content was highest in the top shelves, followed by middle shelves and bottom shelves. The average final moisture content was 16, 95 %. The time required for drying was 20 hours, with an average moisture load of 10, 46 kg H 2 O. The average drying rate was 0, 5228 kg H 2 O/jam or 2, 10 % wet basis per hour. In this experiment intensity of solar radiation was measured to be 634, 88 Watt/m 2, and electric power of 12, 83 Watt was used to run small fan in order to exhaust moist air. The average energy used (Qe) for drying banana chips was 37124, 58 kJ per each drying process and the average energy input used during the drying process (Qrs) was 147. 227, 87 kJ. This meant that average drying efficiency was 27, 07 %. Technically, it can be concluded that solar dryer can be used as an alternative to drying agricultural commodities...|$|R
40|$|The {{body of work}} {{presented}} in this thesis are in three main parts: [1] the effect of ultrasound on freezing events of ionic systems, [2] the importance of formulation osmolality in freeze drying, and [3] a novel system for increasing primary freeze drying rate. Chapter 4 briefly presents the work on method optimisation, which {{is still very much}} in its infancy. Aspects of freezing such as nucleation and ice crystal growth are strongly related with ice crystal morphology; however, the ice nucleation process typically occurs in a random, non-deterministic and spontaneous manner. In view of this, ultrasound, an emerging application in pharmaceutical sciences, has been applied to aid in the acceleration of nucleation and shorten the freezing process. The research {{presented in}} this thesis aimed to study the effect of sonication on nucleation events in ionic solutions, and more importantly how sonication impacts on the freezing process. This work confirmed that nucleation does occur in a random manner. It also showed that ultrasonication aids acceleration of the ice nucleation process and increases the freezing rate of a solution. Cryopreservation of animal sperm is an important aspect of breeding in animal science especially for endangered species. In order for sperm cryopreservation to be successful, cryoprotectants as well as semen extenders are used. One of the factors allowing semen preservation media to be optimum is the osmolality of the semen extenders used. Although preservation of animal sperm has no relation with freeze drying of pharmaceuticals, it was used in this thesis to make a case for considering the osmolality of a formulation (prepared for freeze drying) as a factor for conferring protein protection against the stresses of freeze drying. The osmolalities of some common solutes (mostly sugars) used in freeze drying were determined (molal concentration from 0. 1 m to 1. 2 m). Preliminary investigation on the osmolality and osmotic coefficients of common solutes were carried out. It was observed that the osmotic coefficient trend for the sugars analysed could be grouped based on the types of sugar they are. The trends observed show the need for further studies to be carried out with osmolality and to determine how it may be of importance to protein or API protection during freeze drying processes. Primary drying is usually the longest part of the freeze drying process, and primary drying times lasting days or even weeks are not uncommon; however, longer primary drying times lead to longer freeze drying cycles, and consequently increased production costs. Much work has been done previously by others using different processes (such as annealing) in order to improve primary drying times; however, these do not come without drawbacks. A novel system involving the formation of a frozen vial system which results {{in the creation of a}} void between the formulation and the inside wall of a vial has been devised to increase the primary freeze drying rate of formulations without product damage. Although the work is not nearly complete, it has been shown that it is possible to improve and increase the primary drying rate of formulations without making any modifications to existing formulations, changing storage vials, or increasing the surface area of freeze <b>dryer</b> <b>shelves...</b>|$|R
