5|$|The term Żydokomuna {{originated}} {{in connection with}} the Russian Bolshevik Revolution and targeted Jewish communists during the Polish-Soviet War. The emergence of the Soviet state was seen by many Poles as Russian imperialism in a new guise. The visibility of Jews in both the Soviet leadership and in the Polish Communist Party further heightened such fears. In <b>some</b> <b>circles,</b> Żydokomuna came {{to be seen as a}} prominent antisemitic stereotype expressing political paranoia.|$|E
5|$|Phips, whose motives {{continue}} to be debated by historians today, claimed this {{was a violation of}} the terms of capitulation, and consequently declared the agreement void. He allowed his troops to sack the town and destroy the church, acts that he had promised to prevent in the oral surrender agreement. He had the fortifications destroyed, removing all of their weaponry. Before he left, he convinced a number of Acadians to swear oaths of allegiance to the English crown, appointed a council of locals to administer the town, and then sailed back to Boston, carrying Meneval and his garrison as prisoners of war. Phips received a hero's welcome and was lavished with praise, although he was criticized in <b>some</b> <b>circles</b> (and has been vilified in French and Acadian histories) for allowing the sacking of Port Royal.|$|E

5|$|The State President of the South African Republic, Paul Kruger, {{was not an}} easy man to work with, and in <b>some</b> <b>circles</b> it was {{predicted}} that Reitz would quickly find himself subordinated to Kruger. This was not the case, however. On occasion the two men clashed on matters of policy, but Reitz remained true to his own convictions, gaining some influence over Kruger in the process. Originally praised by the British for his diplomatic courtesy, their attitude quickly changed when they understood that Reitz was a protagonist of Transvaal independence. Reitz was sometimes rather brazen in his political statements, so when he – incorrectly – claimed the South African Republic to be a fully sovereign state, the British jumped on him.|$|E
5|$|Ripostes, {{published}} in October 1912, begins Pound's shift toward minimalist language. Michael Alexander describes the poems as showing a greater concentration {{of meaning and}} economy of rhythm than his earlier work. It was published when Pound had just begun his move toward Imagism; his first {{use of the word}} Imagiste appears in his prefatory note to the volume. The collection includes five poems by Hulme and a translation of the 8th-century Old English poem The Seafarer, although not a literal translation. It upset scholars, as would Pound's other translations from Latin, Italian, French and Chinese, either because of errors or because he lacked familiarity with the cultural context. Alexander writes that in <b>some</b> <b>circles,</b> Pound's translations made him more unpopular than the treason charge, and the reaction to The Seafarer was a rehearsal for the negative response to Homage to Sextus Propertius in 1919. His translation from the Italian of Sonnets and ballate of Guido Cavalcanti was also {{published in}} 1912.|$|E
