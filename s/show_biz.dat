500|$|M. Thomas Inge {{described}} Mansfield, Monroe and Jane Russell as {{personification of}} the bad girl in popular culture, as opposed to Doris Day, Debbie Reynolds and Natalie Wood personifying the good girl. Mansfield, Monroe and Barbara Windsor {{have been described as}} representations of a historical juncture of sexuality in comedy and popular culture. Evangelist Billy Graham once said, [...] "This country knows more about Jayne Mansfield's statistics than the Second Commandment." [...] As late as the mid-1980s she remained one of the biggest TV draws. As an indication of her impact on popular culture today, there are numerous cultural references to the Hollywood sex symbol and Playboy Playmate in recent films, books, TV and music. Numerous <b>show</b> <b>biz</b> people were dubbed [...] "Jayne Mansfield" [...] over the time, including Italian actress Marisa Allasio and professional wrestler Missy Hyatt.|$|E
500|$|Krusty the Clown, born Herschel Shmoikel Pinchas Yerucham Krustofski, {{was born}} in the Lower East Side of Springfield and is the son of Hyman Krustofski. Very little is known about his mother, aside from her name being Rachel and that she died when Krusty was around thirteen. Hyman {{strongly}} opposed Krusty's wish to become a clown and make people laugh, believing that it would distract him from his religion, wanting the boy to go to yeshiva instead. However, Krusty performed slapstick comedy behind his father's back. One day, he was performing at a rabbis' convention when one joking rabbi squirted seltzer on him, washing off his clown makeup. When Rabbi Krustofski found out, he disowned his son, and did not speak to him for 25 years. Krusty was later reconciled with his father with the assistance of Bart and Lisa Simpson. It was later revealed that Krusty did not have a Bar Mitzvah service, because Hyman feared he would violate the sanctity of the rites by [...] "acting up". Krusty had two adult Bar Mitzvah ceremonies: a Hollywood gala which Krusty uses to stage a comeback after his show is cancelled, then a simple ceremony intended to reconnect with his father. After leaving the Lower East Side of Springfield, Krusty started his <b>show</b> <b>biz</b> career as a street mime in Tupelo, Mississippi. (a reference to Elvis Presley's birthplace) Krusty later discovered that he has a daughter named Sophie. He had met Sophie's mother when she served as a soldier in the Gulf War and he was entertaining the troops. After spending the night together, he prevented her from assassinating Saddam Hussein to protect his Saddam-themed comedy act. After that she started hating clowns, and kept their daughter a secret from Krusty. Krusty and Sophie bonded over time, and while not a full-time father, he is known to keep up with her birthdays and to also make occasional in-show references to 'my daughter'.|$|E
