40|$|<b>Silt</b> <b>loads</b> in the Olifants and Sabie river systems {{inside the}} Kruger National Park, were {{monitored}} by collecting water samples every consecutive {{week for a}} period of 20 months. The variation in silt concentration, changes in selected physico-chemical water quality variables and fish mortalities during flushing (i. e. release of silt, by sluicing) of the Phalaborwa Barrage, were also monitored. The Olifants River inside the Kruger National Park carried high <b>silt</b> <b>loads</b> in summer; in the dry season the suspensoid load was greatly reduced. A similar pattern was observed in the Sabie River, but the <b>silt</b> <b>loads</b> were generally lower. It was apparent that <b>silt</b> <b>loads</b> released from the Phalaborwa Barrage led to large variations in the natural <b>silt</b> <b>loads</b> of the Olifants River. These increased amounts of silt (25 000 mg/ 1 to &gt; 70 000 mg/ 1) caused drastic reductions in the dissolved oxygen concentration of the water, ranging from &gt; 6 mg/ 1 to 0 mg/ 1. Depending on the severity and duration of the flushing, fish succumb to such <b>silt</b> <b>loads.</b> These findings, as well as published information, indicate that the management strategy of flushing to improve storage capacity is ecological unacceptable. It is therefore suggested that the use of the Phalaborwa Barrage as a future reservoir should be critically re-evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Although this {{document}} has been {{funded by the}} USEPA under contract to MRI, {{it does not necessarily}} reflect the views of the Agency, and no official endorsement is inferred. Note: this paper was modified to conform to EPA review comments [...] A review of source activity data sources suggests that a significant deficiency exists in the methods for gathering activity data for paved and unpaved roads. The resultant data sets are suspected of being inadequate for proper spatial and temporal representation of emission inventories. This paper presents improved methodologies to construct activity datasets for development of fugitive dust emission estimates by county and by month. The required data sets include paved road <b>silt</b> <b>loading,</b> unpaved road <b>silt</b> content, and unpaved road moisture content. This paper demonstrates how the new activity data sets help to improve the reliability of emission inventory calculations. The <b>silt</b> <b>loading</b> data for paved roads have been divided into baseline contributions from ubiquitous sources and hot spot contributions from application of antiskid materials and from mud/dirt track-out. The baseline <b>silt</b> <b>loading</b> is found to be inversely proportional to the traffic volume on a paved road. The amount of antiskid material is related to the annual snowfall in a region. The hotspot contribution from mud/dirt track-out is dependent on the number of construction sites and the extent of industrial activities involving aggregate handling and transport. Fugitive dust emissions from unpaved roads depend on the silt content that in turn is related to whether native soil or road aggregate is utilized as the surface material. The moisture content of unpaved roads is related to climatic parameters that influence moisture accumulation and moisture loss in the top surface layer. Moisture loss also is dependent on the volume of vehicle traffic because of the enhanced evaporation rate. Unpaved road traffic volume can be predicted on the basis of rural road mileage and rural population density...|$|R

During the wet season the river beds are eroded by the floodwaters and large quantities of fresh and saline water flow out across the tidal flats, where silt is deposited. Large <b>silt</b> <b>loads</b> are also carried out to sea, some of the silt being deposited as a nutrient rich layer on the sea floor, contributing to the muddy waters that characterise Kakadu's coastline.|$|R

5000|$|As {{early as}} 2,000 years ago, the Anasazi {{were known to}} build dams and {{sophisticated}} irrigation systems on tributaries of the San Juan River to irrigate their crops. During the initial period of European settlement in the 1800s, small private dams were built to supply water to farms and mining operations, and to generate hydroelectricity (an early hydro project was the Tacoma power station, built on the Animas River in 1905.) In 1901, the Turley survey concluded that the San Juan River contained enough water to irrigate up to 1300000 acre, but due to {{the high cost of}} delivering water to desert lands, neither private investors nor the federal government were willing to fund such large projects.

The silt-loading and associated data collected over these years at one sampling site may inherently possess site-specific characteristics that can be better incorporated by using panel data models. The factors that are identified as significant are the presence of curbs and gutters, shoulder type, pavement conditions, {{and the presence of}} construction activities in the vicinity of roadways. The presence of curbs and gutters, stabilized shoulders, and good pavement conditions would result in decreased silt loadings. Conversely, the presence of construction activities within the immediate vicinity of sampled areas would result in increases of silt loadings on the roadway surfaces. Based on the analysis of the results, it was recommended that constructing curbs, gutters and stabilized shoulders, preventing or reducing construction track-out from construction activity, and improving pavement conditions be the preferred control measures to reduce silt-loading on paved roadways...|$|R
