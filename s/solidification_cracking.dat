40|$|Abstract. <b>Solidification</b> <b>cracking</b> during welding is {{very serious}} problem for {{practical}} use. Therefore, {{there are so many}} reports concerning <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking.</b> Normally, <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking</b> susceptibility of material is quantitatively evaluated using Trans-Varestraint test. On the other hand, local <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking</b> strain was tried to measure precisely using in-situ observation method, called MISO method about 30 years ago. Recently, digital high-speed video camera develops very fast and its image quality is very high. Therefore, we have started to observe solidification crack using in site observation method.

40|$|The {{large-scale}} {{cast steel}} {{has been used}} in broad fields of industries, such as power generation, construction, vessels, and automobiles. In the solidification process of a hummer used for press machine, for example, sometimes defects such as shrinkage cavity, segregation and cracks appear at hummer 2 ̆ 7 s surface. Shrinkage cavity and segregation can be predicted by performing non-steady state heat transfer analysis; and therefore such two types of defects can be eliminated by using chills which control solidification process. However, uneven cooling rates at different regions of the large-scale cast steel generate thermal stresses, which cause <b>solidification</b> <b>cracks,</b> between the chills. For causing those cracks, thermal stress may be important; however, there have been few studies for this thermal stress analysis. In this study, a three dimensional thermal elasto-plastic stress analysis has been performed by using finite element method in connection with three dimensional non-steady state heat transfer analysis, including interaction between the temperature and stress field. The results provide further understanding of the observed <b>solidification</b> <b>crack</b> failure for large-scale cast steel...|$|R

40|$|Grain {{refinement}} is {{an important}} possibility to enhance the weldability of aluminium weld metal that is usually defined by its susceptibility to <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking.</b> In this study, grain refinement was achieved through the addition of commercial grain refiner containing titanium and boron to the GTA weld metal of aluminium alloy 6082. The weld metal mean grain size could be reduced significantly from about 70 µm to a saturated size of 21 µm with a change in grain shape from columnar to equiaxed. The grain refinement prevented the formation of centreline <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking</b> that was present only in welds with unrefined grain structure. A variation of torch speed led to a strong change of solidification parameters such as cooling rate that was measured in the weld metal and the corresponding solidification rate and thermal gradient. The ratio thermal gradient/growth rate (G/R) decreased from 50 K s/mm 2 (high torch speed) to 10 K s/mm 2 (low torch speed). However, the variation of torch speed did not change the tendency for <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking.</b> The microstructure of unrefined and completely refined weld metal was compared.

This study investigates the tendency of Co-based WC + NiCr composite layers to cracking during the laser cladding process.

The microstructure of the clad layer was composed of Co-based dendrite and brittle eutectic phases at the dendritic boundaries. And WC particles were distributed on the matrix forming intermediate composition region by partial melting of the surface of particles. The overlaid specimen exhibited tensile residual stress, which was accumulated through the beads due to contraction of the coating layer generated by rapid solidification, while the non-clad specimen showed compressive. Also, the specimen overlaid with 55 wt% stellite# 6 and 45 wt% technolase 40 s showed a tensile stress higher than the specimen overlaid with 100 % stellite# 6 possibly, due to the difference between thermal expansion coefficients of the matrix and WC particles. Such tensile stresses can be potential driving force to provide an easy crack path ways for large brittle fractures combined with the crack initiation sites such as the fractured WC particles, pores and <b>solidification</b> <b>cracks.</b> WC particles directly caused clad cracks by particle fracture under the tensile stress.

Although weld <b>solidification</b> <b>cracks</b> can be eliminated through addition of filler alloy, the additives modify the alloy or base-metal constituents and may not always be desirable.

40|$|Weld <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking</b> is an {{important}} issue in fusion welding. If undetected, the cracking defects can act as stress concentration sites which lead to premature failure via fatigue, as well as offer favourable sites for hydrogen assisted cracking and stress corrosion cracking. For welded steel products such as deep sea oil and gas transportation pipes, such defects heighten the risk of catastrophic in-service failures. Such failures can lead to devastating environmental, economic, and social damage. In this thesis, a comprehensive review of literature associated with steel linepipe and <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking</b> defects is first presented. Fluid flow prior to solidification is then observed and quantified in situ using a novel synchrotron X-ray radiography approach. The flow is dynamic at velocities up to 0. 52 m/s and primarily driven via Marangoni flow. The relationship between the microstructure and mechanical properties of the welded linepipe are extensively characterised, with a new equation derived to assess fracture toughness based on the size and distribution of carbonitride precipitates. Weld residual stresses are measured both before and after linepipe expansion in the U-forming, O-forming and expansion process for the first time using a neutron diffraction technique.

HR-I 60 alloy is a solid solution strengthened Ni-Co-Cr-Si alloy. The alloy is designed to resist corrosion in sulfidizing and other aggressive high temperature environments. Silicon is added ({approx} 2. 75 %) to promote the formation of a protective oxide scale in environments with low oxygen activity. HR- 160 alloy has found applications in waste incinerators, calciners, pulp and paper recovery boilers, coal gasification systems, and fluidized bed combustion systems.

A previous study by DuPont, et al. [1] showed that silicon promoted <b>solidification</b> <b>cracking</b> in the commercial alloy.

40|$|The 2 -mm {{butt joints}} of ZE 41 A-T 5 sand {{castings}} were laser welded using 1. 6 mm EZ 33 A-T 5 tiller wire and a continuous wave Nd:YAG system at {{a power of}} 4 kW, surface defocusing and various welding speeds. Compared with the base metal, the fusion zone showed significant grain refinement due to high cooling rate. No grain coarsening was observed in the heat affected zone (HAZ). The porosity area percentage and total <b>solidification</b> <b>crack</b> length in the fusion zone (FZ) were reduced as the welding speed increased from 4 to 7 m/min. Fusion zone area, total penetration depth, and weld width decreased with increased welding speed. The hardness in the FZ was similar to or higher than the base metal after a natural aging of about one year, {{but there was a}} drop in the hardness of the HAZ. The HAZ width decreased with increasing the welding speed. Tensile test showed that a joint efficiency of approximately 75 - 90 % was obtained. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} {{is especially}} suitable for complex-shaped 3 D parts with integrated and optimized functionality realized by filigree geometries. Such designs benefit from low safety factors in mechanical layout. This demands ductile materials that reduce stress peaks by predictable plastic deformation instead of failure. Al–Cu wrought alloys are established materials meeting this requirement. Additionally, they provide high specific strengths. As the designation “Wrought Alloys” implies, {{they are intended}} for manufacturing by hot or cold working. When cast or welded, they are prone to <b>solidification</b> <b>cracks.</b> Al–Si fillers can alleviate this, but impair ductility. Being closely related to welding, Laser Beam Melting in Powder Bed (LBM) of Al–Cu wrought alloys like EN AW- 2219 can be considered challenging. In LBM of aluminium alloys, only easily-weldable Al–Si casting alloys have succeeded commercially today. This article discusses the influences of boundary conditions during LBM of EN AW- 2219 on sample porosity and tensile test results, supported by metallographic microsections and fractography. Load direction was varied relative to LBM build-up direction. T 6 heat treatment was applied to half of the samples. Pronounced anisotropy was observed. Remarkably, elongation at break of T 6 specimens loaded along the build-up direction exceeded the values from literature for conventionally manufactured EN AW- 2219 {{by a factor of}} two...|$|R
