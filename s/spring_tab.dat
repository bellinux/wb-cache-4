25|$|The {{performance}} of the Sea Fury was striking; {{in comparison with the}} 15 years older Hawker Fury biplane the Sea Fury was nearly twice as fast and had double the rate of climb despite far heavier equipment and greater range. The Sea Fury Mk X was capable of attaining a maximum speed of 460mph and climb to a height of 20,000 feet in under five minutes. The Sea Fury was reportedly a highly aerobatic aircraft with favourable flying behaviour at all heights and speeds, although intentional spinning of the aircraft was banned during the type's military service. During flight displays, the Sea Fury could demonstrate its ability to perform rapid rolls at a rate of 100 degrees per second, attributed to the <b>spring</b> <b>tab</b> equipped ailerons.

A subsequent investigation concluded that the accident happened following a structural failure of the port tailplane, and ruled out the possibility that another aircraft was involved.|$|E
2500|$|The fatal {{accident}} occurred on 4 March 1962. A Douglas DC-7C named Star of Robbie Burns (registration: G-ARUD) operating the Douala—Lisbon sector of Caledonian Airways flight 153 (a Lourenço Marques — Luxembourg charter {{on behalf of}} Trans Africa Air Coach of London) crashed shortly after a night takeoff from Douala Airport's runway 12, killing all 111 occupants (ten crew and 101 passengers). At {{the time of the}} accident, the weather was very hot and humid. After a long takeoff run on the airport's [...] long runway, the aircraft gained insufficient height to clear the trees close to the runway end. The aircraft's port wing struck trees [...] above aerodrome elevation, some [...] from the runway end and [...] from the extended centreline. This resulted in the aircraft crashing into a tidal swamp and exploding on impact. Although this was the only {{fatal accident}} in Caledonian's history, it was the deadliest air disaster in British aviation history at the time. The commission of inquiry probing the accident determined that the evidence at the crash site seemed to suggest that a jammed elevator <b>spring</b> <b>tab</b> mechanism prevented the aircraft from attaining sufficient height to clear the obstacles in the runway end's vicinity. This would have resulted in abnormal elevator control forces during takeoff. It was also consistent with tests showing this to prolong takeoff runs that had an attendant risk of losing height during flap retraction when the aircraft became airborne. The commission of inquiry also described a number of adverse features that might have aggravated the circumstances in which the accident occurred. It had furthermore not been able to exclude the possibility of an instrument failure as a probable accident cause as the instruments were either not recovered or too damaged for a valid expert examination.|$|E

This work covers {{his early years}} to the Sputnik launch. His interests have been in research in aeronautics and in the related problems of spaceflight. After an introduction, his early life through the college years is reviewed, and his early interest in model airplanes is described. The first assignment for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), which would later become NASA, was with the Flight Research Division. His early work involved "Flying Qualities", i. e., the stability and control characteristics of an airplane. The next chapter describes his early analytical studies. His work during World War II {{in the design of}} military airplanes, and the other effects of the war on research activities, is covered in the next two chapters. This research was involved in such innovations and refinements as the swept wing, the flettner <b>tabs,</b> servo <b>tabs,</b> <b>spring</b> <b>tabs</b> and whirlerons. The rest of the work covers the research which Mr. Hewitt was involved in, after the war until the Sputnik launch. These areas include unsteady lift, measurements of turbulence in the atmosphere, gust alleviation, and lateral response to random turbulence. He was also involved in several investigations of airplane accidents. The last two chapters cover the administration of the Langley Research Center, and the dawn of the Space Age.

Inasmuch as the spring was preloaded, the tab-spring system was a nonlinear one. Frequency of the tab was the most significant parameter in this study, and an increase in flutter speed with increasing frequency is indicated. At a given frequency, the tab of high aspect ratio is shown to have a slightly lower flutter speed than the one of low aspect ratio.

The results support a perceptual constancy model in olfaction. Chem. Senses 22 : 177 - 180, 1997. Nasal dilators are widely used by high school, college and professional athletes. The nasal dilator is an adhesive device consisting of two tabs {{at the ends of}} a connecting plastic <b>spring.</b> The <b>tabs</b> of the dilator are placed on the nares such that the spring, by its elasticity, continuously dilates the nasal valve. Nasal dilators have been shown to reduce the sound intensity and number of snores per minute, especially during slow wave sleep (Hoijer et al., 1992; Hoffstein et al, 1993). In addition, dilators have been shown to reduce the frequency and severity of obstructed breathing during somnolence (Hoijer et al., 1992). Using rhinomanometry in awake, sitting subjects, Hoijer and co-workers (1992) observed that nasal dilators decreased nasal resistance by an average of 18 % compared with undilated controls. However, the effect, if any, this decreased resistance has on olfactory ability has yet to be studied. Certainly, one possibility is that the decreased resistance could affect sniff vigor. This change in sniff vigor could in turn, as proposed by Teghtsoonian et al. (1978) and Youngentob et al. (1986), influence the size of the perceptual response. Methods, results and discussion In experiment 1, 10 subjects (six females and four males, 22 - 40 years old) were recruited from the SUNY Health Science Center.

25|$|To prevent scarring, it is {{prudent to}} {{periodically}} inspect the brake pads for wear. A tire rotation {{is a logical}} time for inspection, since rotation must be performed regularly based on vehicle operation time and all wheels must be removed, allowing ready visual access to the brake pads. Some types of alloy wheels and brake arrangements will provide enough open space to view the pads without removing the wheel. When practical, pads that are near the wear-out point should be replaced immediately, as complete wear out leads to scarring damage and unsafe braking. Many disc brake pads will include some sort of soft steel <b>spring</b> or drag <b>tab</b> {{as part of the}} pad assembly, which is designed to start dragging on the disc when the pad is nearly worn out. The result is a moderately loud metallic squealing noise, alerting the vehicle user that service is required, and this will not normally scar the disc if the brakes are serviced promptly. A set of pads can be considered for replacement if the thickness of the pad material is the same or less than the thickness of the backing steel. In Pennsylvania, the standard is 1/32".|$|R
40|$|In {{conjunction}} with a program {{of research on the}} general problem of stability of airplanes in the climbing condition, tests have been made of a spring-loaded tb which. is referred to as a ?springy tab,? installed on the elevator of a low-wing scout bomber. The tab was arranged to deflect upward with decrease in speed which caused an increase in the pull force required to trim at low speeds and thereby increased the stick-free static longitudinal stability of the airplane. It was found that the springy tab would increase the stick-free stability in all flight conditions, would reduce the danger of inadvertent stalling because of the definite pull force required to stall the airplane with power on, would reduce the effect of center-of-gravity position on stick-free static stability, and would have little effect on the elevator stick forces in accelerated f 11 ght. Another advantage of the springy tab is that it might be used to provide almost any desired variation of elevator stick force with speed by adjusting the tab hinge-moment characteristics and the variation of <b>spring</b> moment with <b>tab</b> deflection. Unlike the bungee and the bobweight, the springy tab would provide stick-free static stability without requiring a pull force to hold the stick back while taxying. A device similar to the springy tab may be used on the rudder or ailerons to eliminate undesirable trim-force variations with speed...|$|R
