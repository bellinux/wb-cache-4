5|$|A broad muzzle {{is found}} on the river otter's flat head, and the ears are round and inconspicuous. The rhinarium is bare, with an obtuse, {{triangular}} projection. Eyes of the animal are small and placed anteriorly. A short, broad rostrum for exhaling and a long, broad cranium define the relatively flat skull. The river otter's nostrils and ears close during submersion, inhibiting water from entering them. Its vibrissae (whiskers) are long and thick, enhancing <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> underwater and on land.|$|E
40|$|Purpose We {{investigated}} the <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> of patients under local anesthesia who underwent insertion of a totally implantable venous access device (TIVAD). Methods Using semi-structured interviews, {{we conducted a}} qualitative exploratory study of 20 patients. The insertion procedure consisted of four successive phases. Immediately after TIVAD insertion, patients {{were asked to describe}} their <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> in the modalities hearing, sight, touch, smell, and taste during each phase. Descriptions were documented in a Sensory Information Grid (SIG), which was composed of a row and column matrix of entries for the four phases of the procedure and the five sensory modalities. Verbatim descriptions of patients were assigned labels using a descriptive coding process. This approach is called the SIG-method. Results We found that patients experienced many <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> during the TIVAD procedure. <b>Sensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> mainly occurred during preparation of the patient and surgical equipment (phase 2) and during the actual TIVAD insertion (phase 3). Patients perceived fewer olfactory sensations. No taste perceptions were mentioned. Conclusions Patients under local anesthesia reported numerous <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> during surgical TIVAD insertion. The use of the SIG-method emerged to be a suitable method for assessing and documenting patients’ <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions.</b> Reported descriptions can be used in two ways: (1) to develop a structured questionnaire to quantitatively assess <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions,</b> and (2) to prepare patients for what to expect with regard to sensory information experienced before, during, and after TIVAD insertion. This method for exploring and documenting <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> can be applied to other insertions or interventions. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Almost {{all adult}} arachnids have eight legs, and arachnids may be easily {{distinguished}} from insects by this fact, since insects have six legs. However, arachnids also have two further pairs of appendages {{that have become}} adapted for feeding, defense, and <b>sensory</b> <b>perception.</b> The first pair, the chelicerae, serve in feeding and defense. The next pair of appendages, the pedipalps, have been adapted for feeding, locomotion, and/or reproductive functions. In Solifugae, the palps are quite leg-like, so that these animals appear to have ten legs. The larvae of mites and Ricinulei have only six legs; a fourth pair usually appears when they moult into nymphs. However, mites are variable: as well as eight, there are adult mites with six or even four legs.|$|E
25|$|Gustav Fechner began {{conducting}} psychophysics {{research in}} Leipzig in the 1830s, articulating {{the principle that}} human perception of a stimulus varies logarithmically according to its intensity. Fechner's 1860 Elements of Psychophysics challenged Kant's stricture against quantitative study of the mind. In Heidelberg, Hermann von Helmholtz conducted parallel research on <b>sensory</b> <b>perception,</b> and trained physiologist Wilhelm Wundt. Wundt, in turn, came to Leipzig University, establishing the psychological laboratory which brought experimental psychology to the world. Wundt focused on breaking down mental processes into the most basic components, motivated in part by an analogy to recent advances in chemistry, and its successful investigation of the elements and structure of material. Paul Flechsig and Emil Kraepelin soon created another influential psychology laboratory at Leipzig, this one focused on more on experimental psychiatry.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the predictability of clothing comfort from psychological <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> by using feed-forward backpropagation network in the system of Artificial Neural Network (ANN). In order to achieve the objective, a series of wear trials were conducted, in which eleven <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> (clammy, clingy, damp, sticky, heavy, prickly, scratchy, fitness, breath, thermal and comfort) were rated by twenty-two professional athletes in a controlled laboratory. They were asked to wear 4 different garments in each trial and rate the above <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> during their 90 minutes exercising period. The scores then were inputted into five different feed-forward backpropagation neural networks models, which consist of six different number of hidden and output transfer neurones. Results showed that good correlation was found between predicted and actual comfort ratings with significance at p< 0. 001 level with all five models, indicating the overall comfort performance was predictable by using neural networks, particularly, in the models with log sigmoid hidden neurones and pure linear output neurone. Models with a single log sigmoid hidden-layer with 15 neurones or 3 hidden layers, each with 10 log sigmoid hidden neurones are able to produce better predictions than the other models for this particular data set in the study.

40|$|Unusual {{novel foods}} like insects {{generally}} hold little sensory appeal for consumers, but {{little is known}} about the underlying <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> and how the properties of the food contribute to acceptance. This study examined the <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> of 3 unusual novel foods (lamb brain, frog meat, mealworms) that were claimed to be present in beef burger patties. Dutch consumers (n = 100) performed descriptive sensory evaluations and assessed food appropriateness of four different burger patties before and after tasting, and reported their willingness to eat again. The 4 samples were presented in different combinations with 4 labels claiming either 100 % beef or 75 % beef and 25 % novel ingredient, to explore how the food's identity and properties contribute to <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions.</b> Beliefs about the food's taste were informed by species-related associations, and tended to be more negative when the food had never been tasted before. While these pre-consumption beliefs had some influence on <b>sensory</b> <b>perceptions</b> after tasting, the food's properties mainly determined the consumption experience. However, the low willingness to eat had more to do with food appropriateness than the actual taste of the food. The food's taste nevertheless exerts an influence on the perceived food appropriateness and should not be neglected. While incorporating unusual novel foods within a familiar product could help to create more positive expectations, it is still less appealing than the original products that consumers are familiar with. We recommend that future research on novel food acceptance should take into account that perceptions differ between novel and familiar foods, and that product development for culturally inappropriate foods requires selecting suitable product types and adjustment of its properties to match both consumer motivations and taste expectations. </p...|$|R

25|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that approximately 68% of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy experience disturbances in <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> such as dysgeusia. In a pilot study involving twelve lung cancer patients, chemotherapy drugs were infused with zinc in order to test its potential as a treatment. The results indicated that, after two weeks, no taste disturbances were reported by the patients who received the zinc-supplemented treatment while most of the patients in the control group who did not receive the zinc reported taste alterations. A multi-institutional study involving a larger sample size of 169 patients, however, indicated that zinc-infused chemotherapy did not {{have an effect on the}} development of taste disorders in cancer patients. An excess amount of zinc in the body can have negative effects on the immune system, and physicians must use caution when administering zinc to immunocompromised cancer patients. Because taste disorders can have detrimental effects on a patient's quality of life, more research needs to be conducted concerning possible treatments such as zinc supplementation.|$|E
25|$|To justify such {{a radical}} move towards the {{depiction}} {{of the world in}} unrecognizable terms, Antliff and Leighten argue that the emergence of Cubism transpired during an era of dissatisfaction with positivism, materialism and determinism. The 19th century theories upon which such philosophies were based, came under attack by intellectuals such as the philosophers Henri Bergson and Friedrich Nietzsche, William James and the mathematician Henri Poincaré. New philosophical and scientific ideas emerged based on non-Euclidean geometry, Riemannian geometry and the relativity of knowledge, contradicting notions of absolute truth. These ideas were disseminated and debated in widely available popularized publications, and read by writers and artists associated with the advent of Cubism. Popularized too were new scientific discoveries such as Röntgen's X-rays, Hertzian electromagnetic radiation and radio waves propagating through space, revealing realities not only hidden from human observation, but beyond the sphere of <b>sensory</b> <b>perception.</b> Perception was no longer associated solely with the static, passive receipt of visible signals, but became dynamically shaped by learning, memory and expectation.|$|E
25|$|Jung {{was one of}} {{the first}} people to define {{introversion}} and extraversion in a psychological context. In Jung’s Psychological Types, he theorizes that each person falls into one of two categories, the introvert and the extravert. These two psychological types Jung compares to ancient archetypes, Apollo and Dionysus. The introvert is likened with Apollo, who shines light on understanding. The introvert is focused on the internal world of reflection, dreaming and vision. Thoughtful and insightful, the introvert can sometimes be uninterested in joining the activities of others. The extravert is associated with Dionysus, interested in joining the activities of the world. The extravert is focused on the outside world of objects, <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> and action. Energetic and lively, the extrovert may lose their sense of self in the intoxication of Dionysian pursuits. Jungian introversion and extraversion is quite different from the modern idea of introversion and extroversion. Modern theories often stay true to behaviourist means of describing such a trait (sociability, talkativeness, assertiveness etc.) whereas Jungian introversion and extraversion is expressed as a perspective: introverts interpret the world subjectively, whereas extraverts interpret the world objectively.|$|E

500|$|A {{perception}} {{in this context}} is any sensory experience, and the three broad types of perceptual disturbance are hallucinations, pseudohallucinations and illusions.

An illusion is defined as a false <b>sensory</b> <b>perception</b> in the presence of an external stimulus, in other words a distortion of a sensory experience, and may be recognized as such by the subject. A pseudohallucination is experienced in internal or subjective space (for example as [...] "voices in my head") and is regarded as akin to fantasy.|$|E

The first day he was nauseated and the inverted landscape felt unreal, but by the second day just his own body position seemed strange, and by day seven, things felt normal. A sense of strangeness returned when the glasses were taken out, though the world looked straight side up; he found himself reaching out with the right hand when he should have used the left, and the other way around. Then he tried the experiment outdoors. [...] He also tried another experiment disrupting the mental link between touch and sight. There he wore a set of mirrors attached to a harness as shown in the figure allowing, and forcing, him to see his body from above. He found the senses adapted in a similar way over three days. His interpretation was that we build up an association between sight and touch by associational learning over a period of time. During certain periods, the disconnect between vision and touch made him feel as if his body was not where his touch and proprioceptive feeling told him it was. This out-of-body experience, caused by an altered but normal <b>sensory</b> <b>perception,</b> vanished when he attended to the issue critically, focusing on the disconnect.|$|E
