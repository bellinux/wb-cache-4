5|$|Because it is <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> nearest major landmass, the {{ecosystem}} of Kohala has experienced {{the phenomenon of}} geographic isolation, resulting in an ecosystem radically {{different from that of}} other places. Invasive species introduced by man present a problem to Kohala's ecosystem, as they push native species out of their habitat. There are several initiatives to preserve Kohala's ecosystem. Crops, especially sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), have been harvested on the Leeward side of the volcano for centuries as well. The northern part of the island is named after the mountain, with two districts named North and South Kohala. King Kamehameha I, the first King of the Kingdom of Hawaii, was born in North Kohala, near Hawi.|$|E
5|$|There are {{the remains}} of various broch towers in {{southern}} Scotland that appear to date from the period immediately prior to or following Agricola's invasion. They are about fifteen in number and are found in four locations: the Forth valley, close to the Firth of Tay, the far south-west and the eastern Borders. Their existence <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main centres of broch-building {{is something of a}} mystery. The destruction of the Leckie broch may have come {{at the hands of the}} Roman invaders, yet like the nearby site of Fairy Knowe at Buchlyvie a substantial amount of both Roman and native artefacts have been recovered there. Both structures were built in the late 1st century and were evidently high-status buildings. The inhabitants raised sheep, cattle and pigs, and benefited from a range of wild game including Red Deer and Wild Boar.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately, TNOs are <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sun {{that they}} are very cold, hence {{producing}} black-body radiation around 60 micrometres in wavelength. This wavelength of light is impossible to observe on the Earth's surface, but only from space using, e.g. the Spitzer Space Telescope. For ground-based observations, astronomers observe the tail of the black-body radiation in the far infrared. This far infrared radiation is so dim that the thermal method is only applicable to the largest KBOs.|$|E
25|$|From 1905 Anton Tschudi {{started selling}} lots from his farm Øvre Høybråten, which were {{affordable}} for ordinary workers. However, to settle <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city center {{it was necessary}} to get a better transport service. Trains were available from Lørenskog, but the first service did not arrive at Oslo East Station until 07:40, too late for industry workers. They were therefore often forced to spend the weeks in the city center and the weekends with their families at Høybråten. The matter was corrected from 21 April 1908, when a new red eye services commenced.|$|E

25|$|Away {{fans for}} league matches were {{originally}} accommodated {{in the upper}} level, in the north west corner, which can hold a maximum of 3,000 fans. However, plans were made {{at the end of}} the 2007–2008 season to relocate the away supporters to the far end of the upper level of the Leazes End. This location has attracted criticism due to the poor view offered by being <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pitch due the height of the stand, and the 14 flights of stairs to reach the upper level. For FA Cup matches the lower section of the corner is also used.|$|E
25|$|A {{check valve}} lets gas flow in one {{direction}} only. It is usually a chamber containing a ball that is pressed against one end by a spring. Gas flow one way pushes {{the ball out of}} the way, and a lack of flow or a reverse flow allows the spring to push the ball into the inlet, blocking it. Not to be confused with a flashback arrestor, a check valve is not designed to block a shock wave. The shock wave could occur while the ball is <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> inlet that the wave will get past the ball before it can reach its off position.|$|E

25|$|Two {{years after}} Asian Football Confederation (AFC) {{came into being}} in 1954, the first ever AFC Asian Cup was staged in Hong Kong with seven of the 12 {{founding}} members vying for the title to become Asia's best football team. The qualifying process involved the hosts plus {{the winners of the}} various zones (central, eastern and western). It was only a four-team tournament, a format that also existed for 1960 and 1964. Each sub-confederation already hosts their own biennial championship, each with varying degrees of interest. Dominance has swung between the East and West <b>so</b> <b>far.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> superiority of South Korea {{in the early years of}} the competition, the tournament became the preserve of Iran who won three consecutive tournaments in 1968, 1972 and 1976 which also hosted the first and last editions.|$|E
25|$|Also in the 1960s, the Sunday School Board, in {{its most}} ambitious {{publishing}} project, produced the 12-volume Broadman Bible Commentary. Its first volume, covering Genesis and Exodus, came out in 1969. In addition to providing further fuel for the controversy surrounding the Creation account in Genesis, a section written by G. Henton Davies, an English Baptist, questioned {{the reliability of the}} biblical episode in which God commands Abraham to sacrifice his son, Isaac, on the grounds that such an event was morally troubling. This new publication immediately stirred a new phase of the ongoing controversy. Some argued that the Convention was trying to stifle dissent. Others pointed out that since Broadman Press was owned by the SBC, its publications should not stray <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> beliefs of most Southern Baptists.|$|E
25|$|While {{the state}} rooms {{occupied}} {{the northern and}} eastern wings of the palace and the private rooms of the Imperial Family occupied the western wing, {{the four corners of}} the building contained the smaller rooms, which were the apartments of lesser members of the Imperial Family, often being of two floors. This {{is one of the reasons}} that the palace can appear a confusing assortment of great halls or salons with no obvious purpose located in odd corners of the palace. The fact that the Malachite Drawing Room is separated from the equally large Gold Drawing Room by a series of bedrooms and small cabinets initially seems unusual. However, when considered in the context that the Malachite Drawing Room was the principal reception room of the Empress' apartment while the Gold Drawing Room was the principal reception room of the apartment of her daughter-in-law, the Tsarevna, the arrangement of the rooms makes more sense. Similarly the vast White Hall, <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other grand halls, was in fact the principal hall of the Tsarevich's and Tsarevna's apartments. Thus the Winter Palace can be viewed as a series of small palaces within one large palace, with the largest and grandest rooms being public while the residents lived in suites of varying sizes, allocated according to rank.|$|E

On 16 June, he received a dispatch from the King which contained troubling news. The King's advisors on the council of war had overturned Rupert's defensive policies, sending the garrisons of Reading and Abingdon on an offensive in the West Country. This had left Oxford exposed to a sudden threat from the Parliamentarian armies commanded by the Earl of Essex and Sir William Waller and forced the King to leave the city in haste and head to Worcester, where he was still in danger.

500|$|ReMixes {{are added}} to the site after being {{submitted}} by their creators and passed by a panel of judges based on standards and guidelines encouraging arrangement creativity and high production quality. Since the site's founding, more than 150 works have been removed after initially being admitted, generally due to stricter enforcement of the site's standards after the admission of the work. To meet the inclusion standards, works must demonstrate significant arrangement work rather than being a [...] "MIDI rip", a term used for works which take a transcription of the source material and make only minor modifications to it. Other barriers to inclusion include stolen or unoriginal recordings, cover versions that change the performance but not the music itself, arrangements which differ <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> source material as to be unrecognizable, and obvious sub-par execution. The site also maintains a database of the skills of members of its community to encourage artist collaboration.

Only after this did Dugard identify herself as Jaycee Dugard. It was later suggested that Dugard was beginning to show signs of Stockholm syndrome. In a 2016 interview with Diane Sawyer of ABC News, Dugard stated that her compassion and willingness to interact with her captor were only means of surviving. Dugard: [...] "The phrase [...] implies that hostages cracked by terror and abuse become affectionate towards their captors." [...] "Well it's, really, it's degrading, you know, having my family believe that I was in love with this captor and wanted to stay with him.

500|$|In 1951 Tippett {{moved from}} Limpsfield to a large, {{dilapidated}} house, Tidebrook Manor in Wadhurst, Sussex. As The Midsummer Marriage neared completion {{he wrote a}} song cycle for tenor and piano, The Heart's Assurance. This work, a long-delayed tribute to Francesca Allinson (who had committed suicide in 1945), was performed by Britten and Pears at the Wigmore Hall on 7 May 1951. The Midsummer Marriage was finished in 1952, after which Tippett arranged some of the music as a concert suite, the Ritual Dances, performed in Basel, Switzerland, in April 1953. The opera itself was staged at Covent Garden on 27 January 1955. The lavish production, with costumes and stage designs by Barbara Hepworth and choreography by John Cranko, perplexed the opera-going public and divided critical opinion. According to Bowen, most [...] "were simply unprepared for a work that departed <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> methods of Puccini and Verdi". Tippett's libretto was variously described as [...] "one of {{the worst in the}} 350-year history of opera" [...] and [...] "a complex network of verbal symbolism", and the music as [...] "intoxicating beauty" [...] with [...] "passages of superbly conceived orchestral writing". A year after the première, the critic A.E.F.

Perrineau received swimming lessons in preparation for this episode. Perrineau was unaware that his character had been captured by the Others until he was told Michael {{was going to kill}} Ana Lucia and Libby. Perrineau described shooting the scenes in [...] "Two for the Road" [...] where Michael murders Ana Lucia and Libby as a [...] "tough day". The last scene shot of season two was Michael and Walt sailing away from the Island. As it was a long camera shot, Perrineau had to sail the boat <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pier, that by the time he returned, all the equipment had already been packed away. He said, [...] "It felt fitting, actually. Like; that's it". Perrineau knew he would be back one day, but as the producers did not reveal any details to him, he did not know when.
