40|$|Neck pain in {{association}} with the dynamic work environment of the fighter pilot is a well-discussed issue. Spinal symptoms in these pilots were recognized as a serious aero medical problem. Often described contributing factors of neck pain in this population are head movements under high +Gz load, <b>seat-back</b> <b>angle,</b> forward bent posture, head worn equipment, the use of night vision goggles and numbers of fligh...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} <b>seat-back</b> <b>angle</b> and {{accelerometer}} height at the seat-back on seat-back x-axis frequency-weighted root-mean-square (r. m. s.) acceleration {{have been investigated}} in field experiments. Experiment 1 investigated the range and variability, of frequency-weighted r. m. s. acceleration at the same measurement position, where the <b>seat-back</b> <b>angle</b> was 24 degrees from vertical {{on the floor and}} the accelerometer height was 38 cm up from the seat cushion surface. Experiment 2 investigated ranges of frequency-weighted r. m. s. acceleration between the reference position, which was the position used in experiment 1, and test positions at different seat-back angles, 4 degrees ahead of and 4 degrees behind the reference position. Experiment 3 investigated the range of frequency-weighted r. m. s. acceleration between the reference position which was the same as in experiments 1 and experiment 2, and test positions at different accelerometer heights at the seat-back from a seat cushion surface, 2. 5 cm higher, 2. 5 cm lower and 5 cm lower than the reference position. This investigation clarifies that different seat-back angles and accelerometer heights at the seat-back affect the frequency-weighted r. m. s. acceleration at these measurement positions, which is beyond the exposure values at which people are able to distinguish different vibration acceleration magnitudes...|$|E
