5|$|The Friday the 13th films {{generally}} received negative reception {{from professional}} critics, {{in contrast to}} other slashers like Halloween. Critics disliked how the series favored high body counts over plot and character development and how each film was almost indistinguishable from the last. Nevertheless, the films were a financial success, prompting Paramount to release more sequels contingent on the box office appeal. When comparing Friday the 13th to the other top-grossing American slasher franchises—A Nightmare on Elm Street, Child's Play, Halloween, the Hannibal Lecter series, Psycho, Saw, Scream, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre—and adjusting for the 2011 inflation, Friday the 13th is the highest grossing horror franchise in the United States, with approximately $687.1 million. A Nightmare on Elm Street follows with $592.8 million, with the Hannibal Lecter film series closely behind with $588.7 million. Then comes Halloween with $557.5 million, <b>Saw</b> <b>with</b> $457.4 million, Scream with $442.9 million, Psycho with $376.3 million, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre with $304.6 million, and the Child's Play film series rounding out the list with approximately $203 million. The financial success has extended to home release, with more than five million DVDs sold by 2005.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006, the Center for Naval Analyses {{released}} a report on U.S. small arms in combat. The CNA conducted surveys on 2,608 troops returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past 12 months. Only troops who fired their weapons at enemy targets were allowed to participate. 341 troops were armed with M249 SAWs, making up 13 percent of the survey. 71 percent of M249 users (242 troops) {{reported that they were}} satisfied with the weapon. 40 percent of users preferred feeding the <b>SAW</b> <b>with</b> the soft 100-round pouch, while 21 percent chose the soft and hard 200-round pouches each. 60 percent (205 troops) were satisfied with handling qualities, such as handguards, size, and weight - of those dissatisfied, just under half thought that it was too heavy. M249 users had the lowest levels of satisfaction with weapon maintainability at 70 percent (239 troops), most due to the difficulty in removing and receiving small components and poor corrosion resistance. The SAW had the highest levels of stoppages at 30 percent (102 troops), and 41 percent of those that experienced a stoppage said it had a large impact on their ability to clear the stoppage and re-engage their target. 65 percent (222 troops) did not need their machine guns repaired while in theater. 65 percent (222 troops) were confident in the M249's reliability, defined as level of soldier confidence their weapon will fire without malfunction, and 64 percent (218 troops) were confident in its durability, defined as level of soldier confidence their weapon will not break or need repair. Both factors were attributed to high levels of soldiers performing their own maintenance. 60 percent of M249 users offered recommendations for improvements. 17 percent of requests were for making the weapon lighter, and another 17 percent were for more durable belt links and drums, as well as other modifications, such as a collapsible stock.|$|E

25|$|After a re-provisioning stop in New Orleans, Austin {{arrived at}} Sisal on 6 January 1842 {{where she met}} up with San Bernard and the San Antonio. From there the flotilla, {{under the command of}} Commodore Moore, again cruised the Mexican coast in search of prizes. After a stop at the port of Campeche, they {{continued}} on to Veracruz where they took up station as close to shore as conditions permitted. On 6 February, Austin and San Bernard sighted, pursued, and captured the 180-ton Mexican brig Progreso which was sent to Galveston with a small prize crew. Throughout the month of February, bad weather plagued the two Texas ships and they captured no more ships. On 17 February, Austin hoisted the United States flag and sailed into Veracruz harbor to get a first-hand look at the Mexican situation. In Veracruz, Moore <b>saw</b> <b>with</b> alarm an old commercial steamer undergoing naval conversion and a new schooner readying as well. Austin released her captives in Progreso's boats, exited the harbor, and set sail for Cayo Arcos and rendezvous with the San Antonio.|$|E
25|$|According to {{reporter}} James Renner, Dean Runkle is {{a possible}} prime suspect in the FBI investigation. Multiple witnesses say that he matches the man they <b>saw</b> <b>with</b> Mihaljevic {{on the day she}} vanished. Runkle also may have volunteered at the Lake Erie Nature and Science Center in Bay Village {{at the time of the}} murder. All four girls who received suspicious phone calls (with Mihaljevic being the last one) had visited it in the weeks before the abduction, and may have written their names and other personal information in the Center's visitor logbook. Runkle denied remembering this to police, but at least eight former students and teacher's aides reported that Runkle had spoken of being present at the center. Although Renner describes Runkle as an eccentric teacher, no hard evidence supports this view. Runkle himself denies any involvement in the murder of Mihaljevic and the FBI has never officially declared him a suspect. Since Runkle is exceptionally well liked as a teacher by many former students, Renner became the subject of strong criticism, unlike anything he had faced from naming previous suspects, when he named Runkle.|$|E

40|$|Material-saving and {{energy-saving}} {{belong to}} the basic requirements imposed on contemporary manufacturing processes. The realization of these processes gives measurable profi ts, not only economical but also ecological. In the case of wood <b>sawing</b> <b>with</b> circular <b>saw</b> blades, material and energy-savings are dependent on total overall set of teeth (theoretical kerf) and teeth position accuracy {{in relation to the}} workpiece. Hence, it is necessary to achieve a decrease of both raw material and energy losses by the use of narrow-kerf saw blades, an increase of sawing accuracy, as well as a reduction of spacing in case of <b>sawing</b> <b>with</b> a gang of circular saws. However, meeting these requirements in the case of rip <b>sawing</b> <b>with</b> circular <b>saw</b> blades is a quite diffi cult issue and depends on many factors. The detailed analyses concerning ways of chip transportation in the kerf slot, saw blade stiffness, saw blade movement and workpiece feeding accuracy are the proof of these inconvenient technical problems in sawmills. Hence, the realization of economical wood <b>sawing</b> <b>with</b> circular <b>saw</b> blades seems not to be viable until the whole system of sawing fulfils the defined requirements. Thanks to the application of the proecological technology (circular saw blades of a new design), in the examined industrial case, the following results have been achieved: an increase of about 18 % in the amount of side lumber, roughly 16 % less sawdust (as an effect of kerf reduction) and about 16 % lower values of the cutting power consumption...|$|R

25|$|The Breton-Prétot {{machine was}} a saw {{designed}} {{to cut the}} barbed wire protecting enemy trenches of World War I. The first version consisted of a small circular saw, driven by a six hp engine, attached to a long lever that was placed on a small cart with four wheels, {{that had to be}} pushed towards its objective. Breton proposed the machine to the French government in November 1914 and a prototype was tried in January 1915, when it was shown that the system in this form had little practicality. The use of caterpillar tracks was discussed that same month, but since none was available at that time, the system was then mounted at Liancourt {{on the back of a}} Bajac tractor in an attempt to obtain all-terrain mobility, towards the end of February 1915. The small circular saw was replaced by a large vertical <b>saw</b> <b>with</b> thirteen teeth, but a larger horizontal circular saw was added, just above ground level to cut the barbed-wire poles. In July the system was again changed, the horizontal saw being left out and large deflection shields being placed to protect the wheels. Eight small bronze cannon were used as simulation weights.|$|E
25|$|Hybrid {{table saws}} are {{designed}} {{to compete in the}} market with high-end contractor table saws. They offer some of the advantages of cabinet saws at a lower price than traditional cabinet saws. Hybrid saws on the market today offer an enclosed cabinet to help improve dust collection. The cabinet can either be similar to a cabinet <b>saw</b> <b>with</b> a full enclosure from the table top to the floor or a shorter cabinet on legs. Some hybrid saws have cabinet-mounted trunnions and some have table-mounted trunnions. In general, cabinet-mounted trunnions are easier to adjust than table-mounted trunnions. Hybrid saws tend to be heavier than contractor saws and lighter than cabinet saws. Some hybrid saws offer a sliding table as an option to improve cross cutting capability. Hybrid saw drive mechanisms vary more than contractor saws and cabinet saws. Drive mechanisms can be a single v-belt, a serpentine belt or multiple v-belts. Hybrid saws have a 1.5 or 2hp motor and thus the ability to run on a standard 15 or 20 amp 120 volt American household circuit, while a cabinet saw's 3hp or larger motor requires a 240 volt supply.|$|E

In his 1946 review, Charles Lamberton was unable to provide a definitive allocation, confused by the various similarities he <b>saw</b> <b>with</b> aardvarks, pangolins, armadillos, and anteaters. He believed it was most likely a primitive, isolated member of [...] "Edentata", a group in which he included aardvarks, pangolins, and Xenarthra (sloths, armadillos, and anteaters). He rejected some alternatives, such as a close affinity to aardvarks or the possibility that the material assigned to Plesiorycteropus did not in fact represent a single animal. Bryan Patterson, who revised tubulidentates (the order of which the aardvark is the only living representative) in the 1970s, accepted Plesiorycteropus {{as a member of the}} group, dismissing many similarities with pangolins and other animals as convergent. However, he placed it as the only member of its own subfamily Plesiorycteropodinae in view of its differences from other tubulidentates (subfamily Orycteropodinae), and hypothesized that it arrived on Madagascar in the Eocene, at the same time as the lemurs. Johannes Thewissen, who critiqued some aspects of Patterson's classification in 1985, also accepted Plesiorycteropus as a tubulidentate without comment.|$|E
