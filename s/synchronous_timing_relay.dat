40|$|This report {{addresses}} modulation and synchronization {{techniques for}} a multi-frequency time {{division multiple access}} (MF-TDMA) system with onboard baseband processing. The types of synchronization techniques analyzed are asynchronous (conventional) TDMA, preambleless asynchronous TDMA, bit <b>synchronous</b> <b>timing</b> with a preamble, and preambleless bit <b>synchronous</b> <b>timing.</b> Among these alternatives, preambleless bit <b>synchronous</b> <b>timing</b> simplifies onboard multicarrier demultiplexer/demodulator designs (about 2 : 1 reduction in mass and power), requires smaller onboard buffers (10 : 1 to approximately 3 : 1 reduction in size), and provides better frame efficiency as well as lower onboard processing delay. Analysis and computer simulation illustrate that this technique can support a bit rate of up to 10 Mbit/s (or higher) with proper selection of design parameters. High bit rate transmission may require Doppler compensation and multiple phase error measurements. The recommended modulation technique for bit <b>synchronous</b> <b>timing</b> is coherent QPSK with differential encoding for the uplink and coherent QPSK for the downlink...|$|R

40|$|Multiagent systems {{arise in}} several domains of engineering. Examples include arrays of mobile sensor {{networks}} for aggregate imagery, autonomous highways, and formations of unmanned aerial vehicles. In these contexts, agents {{are governed by}} vehicle dynamics and often constraints, and the control objective is achieved by cooperation. Cooperation refers to the agreement of the agents to 1) have a common objective with neighboring agents, with the objective typically decided offline, and 2) share information online to realize the objective. To be viable, the control approach for multiagent systems should be distributed, for autonomy of the individual agents and for scalability and improved tractability over centralized approaches. Optimization-based techniques are suited to multiagent problems, in that such techniques can admit very general objectives. Receding horizon control is an optimization-based approach that is applicable when dynamics and constraints on the system are present. Several researchers have recently explored the use of receding horizon control to achieve multi-vehicle objectives. In most cases, the common objective is formulated, and the resulting control law implemented, in a centralized way. This dissertation provides a distributed implementation of receding horizon control with guaranteed convergence and performance comparable to a centralized implementation. To begin with, agents are presumed to be individually governed by heterogeneous dynamics, modelled by a nonlinear ordinary differential equation. Coupling between agents occurs in a generic quadratic cost function of a single optimal control problem. The distributed implementation is generated by decomposition of the single optimal control problem into local problems, and the inclusion of local compatibility constraints in each local problem. The coordination requirements are globally <b>synchronous</b> <b>timing</b> and local information exchanges between neighboring agents. For sufficiently fast update times, the distributed implementation is proven to be asymptotically stabilizing. Extensions for handling inter-agent coupling constraints and partially <b>synchronous</b> <b>timing</b> are also explored. The venue of multi-vehicle formation stabilization demonstrates {{the efficacy of the}} implementation in numerical experiments. Given the generality of the receding horizon control mechanism, there is great potential for the implementation presented here in dynamic and constrained distributed systems...|$|R

We introduce a transformation tech-nique from synchronous algorithms to indulgent algorithms (Guerraoui, in PODC, pp. 289 – 297, 2000), which induces only a constant overhead in terms of time com-plexity in well-behaved executions. Our technique is based on a new abstraction we call an asynchrony detector, which the participating processes implement collectively. The resulting transforma-tion works for the class of colorless distributed tasks, including consensus and set agreement. Interestingly, we also show that our technique is relevant for colored tasks, by applying it to the renaming problem, to obtain the first indulgent renam-ing algorithm...|$|R

50|$|Timing relays are {{arranged}} for an intentional delay in operating their contacts. A very short (a {{fraction of a}} second) delay would use a copper disk between the armature and moving blade assembly. Current flowing in the disk maintains magnetic field for a short time, lengthening release time. For a slightly longer (up to a minute) delay, a dashpot is used. A dashpot is a piston filled with fluid that is allowed to escape slowly; both air-filled and oil-filled dashpots are used. The time period can be varied by increasing or decreasing the flow rate. For longer time periods, a mechanical clockwork timer is installed. Relays may be arranged for a fixed timing period, or may be field adjustable, or remotely set from a control panel. Modern microprocessor-based <b>timing</b> <b>relays</b> provide precision <b>timing</b> over a great range.|$|R
40|$|A new {{asynchronous}} interconnection {{network is}} introduced for globally-asynchronous locally-synchronous (GALS) chip multiprocessors. The network {{eliminates the need}} for global clock distribution, and can interface multiple <b>synchronous</b> <b>timing</b> domains operating at unrelated clock rates. In particular, two new highly-concurrent asynchronous components are introduced which provide simple routing and arbitration/merge functions. Post-layout simulations in identical commercial 90 nm technology indicate that comparable recent synchronous router nodes have 5. 6 - 10. 7 x more energy per packet and 2. 8 - 6. 4 x greater area than the new asynchronous nodes. Under random traffic, the network provides significantly lower latency and competitive throughput over the entire operating range of the 800 MHz network and through mid-range traffic rates for the 1. 36 GHz network, but with degradation at higher traffic rates. Preliminary evaluations are also presented for a mixedtiming (GALS) network in a shared-memory parallel architecture, running both random traffic and parallel benchmark kernels, as well as directions for further improvement. ...|$|R

This self-routed hierarchical architecture employs <b>synchronous</b> <b>timing</b> and distributed traffic-control signaling to eliminate optical buffering and to reduce the required routing logic, greatly facilitating a photonic implementation. In previous work, we have shown the efficient scalability of the architecture under uniform and random traffic conditions while maintaining high throughput and low-latency performance. This paper reports {{on the performance of}} the Data Vortex architecture under nonuniform and bursty traffic conditions. The results show that the switch architecture performs well under modest nonuniform traffic, but an excessive degree of nonuniformity will severely limit the scalability. As long as a modest degree of asymmetry between the number of input and output ports is provided, the Data Vortex switch is shown to handle very bursty traffic with little performance degradation.

40|$|Abstract-In {{field and}} {{laboratory}} bioassay experiments, {{we show that}} larvae of the codling moth, Cydia pomonella, cocoon in aggregations. This aggregation behavior of fifth-instar larvae prior to pupation and arrestment of eclosed adult males by mature female pupae seems to allow mating as soon as an adult female ecloses. This <b>synchronous</b> <b>timing</b> is realized because foraging fifth-instar are attracted by cocoon-spinning larvae and prepupae, but not by pupae, and because male pupae develop faster than female pupae. Eclosed males are arrested by sex pheromone that disseminates from female pupae even before adult females eclose. Communication in C. pomonella within and among developmental stages (larva-larva and pupa-adult, respectively) may be a strategy to procure mates. If so, our data add to current knowledge that attraction of mates in insects relies on communication among adults, or pupae and adults.

40|$|The {{explosion}} {{in the number of}} states due to several interacting components limits the application of model checking in practice. Compositional reasoning ameliorates this problem by reducing reasoning about the entire system to reasoning about individual components. Such reasoning is often carried out in the assume-guarantee paradigm: each component guarantees certain properties based on assumptions about the other components. Naïve applications of this reasoning can be circular and, therefore, unsound. We present a new rule for assume-guarantee reasoning, which is sound and complete. We show how to apply it, in a fully automated manner, to properties specified as <b>synchronous</b> <b>timing</b> diagrams. We show that timing diagram properties have a natural decomposition into assume-guarantee pairs, and liveness restrictions that result in simple subgoals which can be checked efficiently.

40|$|Abstract—We present {{experimental}} and numerical studies {{of a novel}} packet-switch architecture, the data vortex, designed for large-scale photonic interconnections. The selfrouting multihop packet switch efficiently scales to large port counts (10 k) while maintaining low latencies, a narrow latency distribution, and high throughput. To facilitate optical implementation, the data-vortex architecture employs a novel hierarchical topology, traffic control, and <b>synchronous</b> <b>timing</b> that act to reduce the necessary routing logic operations and buffering. As {{a result of this}} architecture, all routing decisions for the data packets are based on a single logic operation at each node. The routing is further simplified by the employment of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) -encoded header bits, which enable packet-header processing by simple wavelength filtering. The packet payload remains in the optical domain as it propagates through the data-vortex switch fabric, exploiting the transparency and high bandwidths achievable in fiber optic transmission.

Due to a lack of long, continuous, high-resolution paleoclimate archives from mid-southern latitudes, it remains unclear what factors control changes in its intensity and how past changes affected the climates of landmasses in their path. Here we show growth rate and stable isotope (18 O, 13 C) profiles from a South Island, New Zealand, stalagmite (HW 3) that permit centennial-scale investigation of Southern Hemisphere westerly paleointensity between 73 and 11 ka. Correlation between HW 3 growth rate and isotope profiles suggests sensitivity to changes in annual precipitation, a factor controlled by westerly intensity. Low growth rates and relatively enriched isotope ratios define long-term trends in HW 3, supporting existing evidence that weaker westerlies predominated during the last glacial period. Abrupt millennial-scale events occur frequently, such that the HW 3 record resembles Greenland ice core stable isotope profiles. Furthermore, nearly <b>synchronous</b> <b>timing</b> of nine prominent wet and cool intervals with Heinrich events supports studies showing that increased westerly intensity is closely linked to North Atlantic cooling.
