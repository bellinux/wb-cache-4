500|$|While {{on patrol}} {{near the mouth}} of the Co Chien River {{in the early hours of}} 20 June, the skipper of Point League noted a large radar contact which, upon further investigation, was found to be running without {{navigation}} lights. After informing the CSC of the situation the cutter went to general quarters and spotlighted the incoming trawler. The trawler ignored a hail from Point League and two bursts of machine gun fire across its bow. The trawler returned with heavy machine gun fire hitting the cutter's bridge and wounding the executive officer and a crewman manning the mortar on the forecastle. The trawler dropped the line on a towed junk and picked up speed in an effort to beach along the shore. When the commanding officer of Point League noticed that the trawler was headed for shoal water {{near the mouth of}} the river, he let the trawler run aground [...] from shore and moved to a position [...] away while keeping the target illuminated with mortar rounds. Point League then came under fire from Viet Cong elements operating from just behind the shoreline. With assistance from Point Slocum the two cutters poured machine gun fire into the grounded trawler. Just after dawn the trawler was sunk by what was probably a scuttling charge resulting in a large fire. At 07:15 destroyer escort [...] arrived on scene and assumed control of the operation. With the assistance of two U.S. Air Force F-100 Super Sabre aircraft providing close air <b>support,</b> <b>resistance</b> from the shoreline was finally controlled. It was decided by the commanding officer of the Haverfield that salvage of the trawler would be attempted in order to learn more about the trawler, its origins and the cargo on board. The crews of the two cutters were joined by Point Hudson and dock landing ship [...] and several RVN junks in fighting the fire and beginning salvage operations. After patching the hull and dewatering; the trawler was eventually towed to the RVN shipyard at Vung Tau. The [...] trawler yielded valuable information about the capabilities of that particular class of trawler. It was carrying about [...] of small arms and ammunition of recent manufacture in China and North Korea. The surviving log and navigation charts helped determine the trawler's origin and two possible destinations.|$|E

5000|$|Gröber remains {{controversial}} to {{this day}} because of his stance during the Nazi era. In particular, {{in the first two}} years after the National Socialists' seizure of power, he hoped that the Church would be able to come to terms with them, and that it would be better to dialogue with them than to <b>support</b> <b>resistance.</b> For tactical reasons, Adolf Hitler repeatedly encouraged such hopes. Thus Gröber wrote in an exhortation dated November 8, 1933 on the subject of the vote and plebiscite regarding Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations, that it was a duty to the fatherland to show unanimity with one's fellow countrymen. Among the populace, his policy of cooperation gained Gröber the nickname of Der braune Bischof (the brown Bishop). Thus during the course of the subordination of provincial governments to the Nazi central government, he directed a congratulatory telegram to the National Socialist politician appointed as proconsul in Baden, Robert Heinrich Wagner, containing the following message: [...] "At the mighty task which lies before you, I place myself as the chief shepherd of Catholics in Baden unreservedly at your side." [...] At the diocesan synod in Freiburg from April 25-28, 1933, he advised the diocesan clergy: [...] "no provocation and no useless martyrdom." ...|$|E
