25|$|The {{governments of}} Britain and the United <b>States</b> <b>repeatedly</b> protested the brutal {{treatment}} of Romanians Jews. They were aliens {{who had no}} civil or political rights. The government tolerated their frequent humiliation, blocked entry into many professions and government service. It engaged in arbitrary expulsions as vagabonds, and tolerated violent pogroms around the country. Many Jews fled to the United States.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{recognizing}} Cuba's {{transition into}} an independent republic, United States Governor Charles Edward Magoon assumed temporary military rule {{for three more}} years following a rebellion led in part by José Miguel Gómez. In the following 20 years the United <b>States</b> <b>repeatedly</b> intervened militarily in Cuban affairs: 1906–09, 1912 and 1917–22. In 1912 U.S. forces were sent to quell protests by Afro-Cubans against discrimination.|$|E
500|$|The {{reputation}} of corrupt and arbitrary state legislatures continued to decline as the Senate joined the House of Representatives implementing popular reforms. Judge Bybee {{has argued that}} the amendment led to complete [...] "ignominy" [...] for state legislatures without the props of a state-based check on Congress. Progressive measures were enacted to enable the federal government to supersede the discredited <b>states</b> <b>repeatedly</b> over decades. However, Schleiches argues that the separation of state legislatures and the Senate has had a beneficial effect on the states, as it has allowed state legislative campaigns to focus on local rather than national issues.|$|E

2500|$|Statements of President Chávez over a {{potential}} coup {{involvement of the}} United States are varied. Shortly before the coup attempt, Chávez dismissed possible hostility from the United States, since [...] "times had changed." [...] After the coup, however, Chávez asserted numerous times that United States government officials knew about plans for a coup, approved of them, and assumed they would be successful, alleging that [...] "two military officers from the United States" [...] {{were present in the}} headquarters of coup plotters. Chávez would also state after the coup that there was [...] "little evidence" [...] that the United States orchestrated the plan. Rear Admiral Carlos Molina, a central leader of the coup, later said that [...] "We felt we were acting with US support... we agree that we can’t permit a communist government here. The US has not let us down yet." [...] However, the United <b>States</b> <b>repeatedly</b> informed the Venezuelan opposition {{that they would not be}} supported if there were a coup and President George W. Bush denied the United States' involvement.|$|E
2500|$|Through 2008, the United <b>States</b> <b>repeatedly</b> {{refused to}} rule out using nuclear weapons in an attack on Iran. The U.S. Nuclear Posture Review made public in 2002 {{specifically}} envisioned {{the use of nuclear}} weapons on a first strike basis, even against non-nuclear armed states. Investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported that, according to military officials, the Bush administration had plans for the use of nuclear weapons against [...] "underground Iranian nuclear facilities". When specifically questioned about the potential use of nuclear weapons against Iran, President Bush claimed that [...] "All options were on the table". According to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientist, Bush [...] "directly threatened Iran with a preemptive nuclear strike. It is hard to read his reply in any other way." [...] The Iranian authorities consistently replied that they were not seeking nuclear weapons as a deterrent to the United States, and instead emphasize the creation of a nuclear-arms free zone in the Middle East. The policy of using nuclear weapons on a first-strike basis against non-nuclear opponents is a violation of the US Negative Security Assurance pledge not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear members of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) such as Iran. Threats of the use of nuclear weapons against another country constitute a violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 984 and the International Court of Justice advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons.|$|E
