25|$|Mechanically, {{fourth-generation}} Glock pistols are {{fitted with}} a dual recoil <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> to help reduce perceived recoil and increase service life expectancy. Earlier subcompact Glock models such as the Glock 26 and Glock 30 have already used a dual recoil <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> which was carried over to the fourth-generation versions of those models. The slide and barrel shelf have been resized, and the front portion of the polymer frame has been widened and internally enlarged, to accommodate the dual recoil <b>spring</b> <b>assembly.</b> The trigger mechanism housing has also been modified {{to fit into the}} smaller-sized grip space.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, an {{integrated}} recoil <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> replaced the original two-piece recoil spring and tube design. The magazine was slightly modified, changing the floorplate and fitting the follower spring with a resistance insert at its base.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, Ruger {{produced}} a limited-run P89X convertible model, which {{came with a}} second barrel and recoil <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> that allowed conversion between 9mm and [...]30 Luger calibers. Ruger only made 5750 with both barrels.|$|E

2500|$|In late July 2012, the U.S. Marines {{placed a}} $22.5 million order for 12,000 M1911 pistols for MEU(SOC) forces. The new 1911 was {{designated}} M45A1 or [...] "Close Quarters Battle Pistol" [...] CQBP. [...] The M45A1 features a dual recoil <b>spring</b> <b>assembly,</b> Picatinny rails and is cerakoted tan in color.|$|E
2500|$|The Ruger SR9c {{started to}} ship in January 2010, {{according}} to Ruger. The SR9c is lighter and dimensionally smaller {{compared to the}} SR9, but {{it has the same}} grip width (measured across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. [...] The manual safety, adjustable rear sights, and updated version of the trigger are all present in the compact version also. In contrast to the SR9 recoil <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> the SR9c pistols are fitted with a dual recoil <b>spring</b> <b>assembly.</b> The SR9c is normally supplied with two magazines. The standard 10-round compact magazine features a flat bottom floor plate, with an extended floor plate also included. The second magazine is a full-size 17-round unit featuring a grip adapter that transforms the short compact SR9c grip into a full-sized grip. [...] However, in jurisdictions where the number of rounds in a firearm are limited by law the SR9c is shipped from Ruger with two 10-round magazines and two extended floor plates. [...] Additional retraction grooves (serrations) are located on the front sides of the SR9c slide, making it easier to operate and press-check the slide. The Ruger SR9c was chosen as the Shooting Industry Academy of Excellence's Handgun of the Year in 2010.|$|E
2500|$|The motor is {{attached}} to the frame at one end. [...] The hinges for the damper bar are attached at each end, and the <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> and the pedal are usually attached in the middle. [...] Two banks of resonator tubes are laid into grooves in the frame so that they straddle the damper bar. [...] The resonators are not firmly fastened to the frame. [...] The ends of the shafts that gang the disks are attached to the drive of the motor via a drive belt similar to an O-ring.|$|E

2500|$|In September 2011, Glock {{announced}} a recoil spring exchange {{program in which}} the manufacturer voluntarily offers to exchange the recoil <b>spring</b> <b>assemblies</b> of its fourth-generation pistols (with {{the exception of the}} [...] "subcompact" [...] Glock 26 and Glock 27 models) sold before 22 July 2011 at no cost [...] "to ensure our products perform up to GLOCK’s stringent standards", according to the company.|$|R
2500|$|The 92A1 and 96A1 [...] were {{introduced}} in 2010, based on elements from the 92FS and 90two. The overall shape and styling builds on the 92FS with more parts commonality than the 90-two had. From the 90-two comes a heavier slide construction combined with a slightly altered frame to accommodate the picatinny rail and [...]40 S power levels. While most internal components are compatible with standard 92 models, the slide, frame, captive recoil <b>spring</b> <b>assembly,</b> and takedown lever and button of the 92A1 and 96A1 are not interchangeable with other models other than the 90-two.|$|E
2500|$|At the 2010 SHOT Show, Glock {{presented}} the [...] "fourth generation", now dubbed [...] "Gen4" [...] by Glock itself. [...] Updates centered on ergonomics and the recoil <b>spring</b> <b>assembly.</b> Some parts of fourth-generation Glock pistols cannot be interchanged {{with those of}} the previous generations. The initial two fourth-generation models announced were the full-sized Glock 17 and Glock 22, chambered for the 9×19mm Parabellum and [...]40 S cartridges, respectively. The pistols were displayed with a modified rough-textured frame, grip checkering, and interchangeable backstraps of different sizes. [...] "Gen4" [...] is rollmarked on the slide next to the model number to identify the fourth-generation pistols.|$|E
2500|$|The Glock 26 is a 9×19mm [...] "subcompact" [...] variant {{designed}} for concealed carry and {{was introduced in}} 1995, mainly for the civilian market. It features a smaller frame compared to the Glock 19, with a pistol grip that supports only two fingers, a shorter barrel and slide, and a double-stack magazine with a standard capacity of 10 rounds. A factory magazine with a +2 extension gives a capacity of 12 rounds. In addition, factory magazines from the Glock 17, Glock 18, and Glock 19, with capacities of 15, 17, 19, 31 and 33 rounds, will function in the Glock 26. More than simply a [...] "shortened" [...] Glock 19, design of the subcompact Glock 26 required extensive rework of the frame, locking block, and <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> that features a dual recoil spring.|$|E
50|$|In 930 AD, the {{constitution}} of Iceland was instituted which made Iceland a self-governing country with a people’s assembly called the Althing (alþingi). The Althing represented the people and met once a year to make laws and judge important cases. Matters of lesser importance were dealt with by local <b>spring</b> <b>assemblies,</b> regulated by local chiefs. The Althing was {{an important part of}} Icelandic culture and would be integral in their struggle to become an independent nation.|$|R

50|$|These {{embodied}} political decrees {{which all}} {{subjects of the}} kingdom were bound to observe. They often bore the name of edictuin or of constitutio, and the provisions made in them were permanent. These capitularies were generally elaborated by {{the king of the}} Franks in the autumn assemblies or in the committees of the <b>spring</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Frequently we have only the proposition made by the king to the committee, capitula tractanda cum comitibus, episcopis, et abbatibus, and not the final form which was adopted.|$|R
2500|$|The system {{comprises}} two {{suspension cylinders}} mounted horizontally {{on each side}} of the platform chassis. Inside the cylinders are two springs, one for each wheel, mounted at each end of the cylinder. The springs are connected to the front leading swinging arm and rear trailing swinging arm, that act like bellcranks by pull rods (tie rods). These are connected to spring seating cups in the middle of the cylinder, each spring being compressed independently, against the ends of the cylinder. Each cylinder is mounted using an additional set of springs, originally made from steel, called [...] "volute" [...] springs, on later models made from rubber. These allow the front and rear suspension to interconnect. When the front wheel is deflected up over a bump, the front pull rod compresses the front spring inside the cylinder, against the front of the cylinder. This also compresses the front [...] "volute" [...] spring pulling the whole cylinder forwards. That action pulls the rear wheel down on the same side via the rear <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> and pull rod. When the rear wheel meets that bump a moment later, it does the same in reverse, keeping the car level front to rear. When both springs are compressed on one side when travelling around a bend, or front and rear wheels hit bumps simultaneously, the equal and opposite forces applied to the front and rear spring assemblies reduce the interconnection. It reduces pitching, which is a particular problem of soft car suspension.|$|E
6000|$|THE RELIGIOUS DRAMA. In its {{simplicity}} the drama {{is a familiar}} story retold to the eye by actors who [...] "make believe" [...] {{that they are the}} heroes of the action. In this elemental form the play is almost as old as humanity. Indeed, {{it seems to be a}} natural impulse of children to act a story which has given them pleasure; of primitive men also, who from time immemorial have kept alive the memory of tribal heroes by representing their deeds in play or pantomime. Thus, certain parts of Hiawatha are survivals of dramatic myths that were once acted at the <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> of the Algonquin Indians. An interesting fact concerning these primitive dramas, whether in India or Greece or Persia, is that they were invariably associated with some religious belief or festival.|$|E

50|$|Recoil and counter-recoil were {{controlled}} hydraulically {{by means of}} a piston and spring combination connected to the recoiling mechanism and operating in an oil-filled recuperator cylinder mounted to the stationary trunnion block assembly. The recoiling mechanism of the gun included the tube and tube extension, recuperator piston and piston rod, lock frame <b>assembly,</b> driving <b>spring</b> <b>assemblies,</b> and the breechblock assembly. The nonrecoiling parts included the trunnion block group, the feed box and feeding mechanism, the recuperator cylinder and bushing, the back plate group, and the manual charger assembly.|$|R
50|$|Powder Deaerators {{consist of}} two {{parallel}} drums - a filter drum and a pressure drum - which rotate in opposite directions. The drums are driven via drive motor and spur gear. The filter drum is {{coated with a}} porous sinter metal layer. It is connected to a vacuum line via a hollow shaft creating a negative pressure within the filter drum. An adjusting device serves for {{the setting of the}} gap width between the rollers. On the adjusting device there are <b>spring</b> <b>assemblies</b> to generate the necessary pressure.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine frame}} was welded in one piece. Sport had no front brake, but the motocarro had a drum brake {{on the front}} wheel. The front {{suspension}} consisted of a Girdervork with a central helical spring without damping. The [...] "frame" [...] was a simple structure consisting of two box girders that ran from the engine to the rear axle and frame were supported by two tubes from the seatpost. Above the rear axle, two leaf <b>spring</b> <b>assemblies</b> mounted, which does not afveerden the engine, but the container does.|$|R

25|$|Widely imitated, {{the safety}} bicycle {{completely}} replaced the high-wheeler in North America and Western Europe by 1890. Meanwhile, John Dunlop's reinvention of the pneumatic bicycle tire in 1888 {{had made for}} a much smoother ride on paved streets; the previous type were quite smooth-riding, when used on the dirt roads common at the time. As with the original velocipede, safety bicycles had been much less comfortable than high-wheelers {{precisely because of the}} smaller wheel size, and frames were often buttressed with complicated bicycle suspension <b>spring</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The pneumatic tire made all of these obsolete, and frame designers found a diamond pattern to be the strongest and most efficient design.|$|R

Here I {{was even more}} {{interested}} in the jays, and it was indeed chiefly for the pleasure of seeing them, when they are best to look at, that I visited this forest. I had also formed the idea that there was no place in England where the jay could be seen to better advantage, as they are, or until recently were, exceedingly abundant at Savernake, and were not in constant fear of the keeper and his everlasting gun. Here one could witness their early <b>spring</b> <b>assemblies,</b> when the jay, beautiful at all times, is seen at his very best.|$|R

50|$|To {{fasten the}} binding, the <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> was lifted, sliding on a plastic disk. After being raised {{slightly}} it could move forward, releasing all {{tension on the}} clips. A metal clip prevented it from moving under the boot area, while also acting as a mounting spot for a safety strap. The boot could then be forced onto the angled upper area of the clips, forcing them to open outward, and then fastened by pushing the spring back down to re-apply tension. Step-in action in the S-2/3/4 series was accomplished by a small spring-loaded pin catch on the cams. When the <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> was lifted, the pin was forced upward into a hole on the T-arm running to the spring, holding it forward. When the skier stepped in, the pin would be pushed down and release the arm, springing the clips closed. The S-9 model improved on this using a large lever over the <b>spring</b> <b>assembly</b> that released spring pressure by pushing the spring forward when it was pushed down with a ski pole. The lever also had a finger that pressed up on the sole of the boot, helping it pop open the clips. This gave the system true step-in, step-out behaviour.|$|E

50|$|Public {{addresses}} {{on matters}} of importance were delivered at the Law Rock and there the assembly was called to order and dissolved. The Lögrétta, the legislative section of the assembly, was its most powerful institution. It comprised the 39 district goðar plus nine additional members and the Lawspeaker. As the legislative section of Althing, the Lögrétta took a stand on legal conflicts, adopted new laws and granted exemptions to existing laws. Althing of old also performed a judicial function and heard legal disputes {{in addition to the}} <b>spring</b> <b>assemblies</b> held in each district. After the country had been divided into four quarters around 965 AD, a court of 36 judges (fjórðungsdómur) was established for each of them at Althing. Another court (fimmtardómur) was established early in the 11th century. It served as a supreme court of sorts, and assumed the function of hearing cases left unsettled by the other courts. It comprised 48 judges appointed by the goðar of Lögrétta.|$|R
