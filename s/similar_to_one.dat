5|$|Across {{the street}} from the Longfellow House–Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site is the {{municipal}} park known as Longfellow Park. In the middle sits a memorial by sculptor Daniel Chester French dedicated in 1914. In addition to a bust of the poet, a carved bas-relief by Henry Bacon depicts the famous characters Miles Standish, Sandalphon, the village blacksmith, the Spanish student, Evangeline, and Hiawatha. The monument is <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> French designed for the street that leads to Sunnyside, the former home of Washington Irving.|$|E

Traces of the abbot's house were discovered during building works in 1989 and a small oval window was incorporated into the new building. Archaeological investigations have found graves with human remains, dating to the thirteenth to fifteenth century, and a medieval conduit, <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> excavated at Saint Augustine's Abbey in Bristol.|$|E
5|$|A Boston man (Joe Towne) is {{attacked}} by a shadowy, ghost-like figure; his wife (Michelle Harrison) returns home to find he disintegrates into ash upon being touched. After learning all of the victims had recently visited a hospital before dying, Agent Broyles (Lance Reddick) explains the case is <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> he had trouble with in the past, in which his obsessive behavior effectively ended his marriage to his wife Diane. The suspect, an Eastern European man, had contacted him four years ago sounding distraught {{and asked him to}} figure out a special formula, which Broyles was unable to solve. Walter (John Noble) and Peter (Joshua Jackson) study the victim's remains at their lab and begin studying the formula given to Broyles.|$|E

5|$|A {{tower was}} {{built out of}} {{the remains of the}} roof, <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> that had existed at Claremont Road, and a system of defences and {{blockades}} were built. A core of around 30 protesters ensured that there were always people staying there (a legal requirement for a squatted home, as well as a defence against eviction). They were finally evicted on 21 June 1995, whereupon, as at Claremont Road, the building was immediately demolished. The total cost of removing the protesters from Munstonia was given to be £239,349.52, not including additional costs of security guards.|$|E
5|$|At Sinclair's home, Jenny {{discovers that}} he is a Nazi secret agent and knocks him out. She is later {{detained}} and forced to leave a message for Cliff to bring the rocket pack to the Griffith Observatory in exchange for her life. Just before he is arrested by the FBI and taken to Hughes and Peevy, Cliff hides the rocket pack. Hughes explains that his rocket pack is a prototype, <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> that Nazi scientists have, up to now, been unsuccessful in developing, and shows them a horrifying propaganda film that reveals the scope of the Nazis' plans, depicting an army of flying soldiers invading the United States. The FBI agents mention that they are tracking a Nazi spy in Hollywood, whom Cliff realizes to be Sinclair. When Hughes demands the return of the rocket pack, Cliff explains that he needs it to rescue Jenny; he escapes, inadvertently leaving behind a clue to where he is headed.|$|E
5|$|On 29 February {{a rocket}} {{launcher}} <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> seized in the 1999 raid was found near an army base in Dungannon, County Tyrone, and on 15 March three men were arrested {{following the discovery}} of 500lb of home-made explosives when the RUC searched two cars in Hillsborough, County Down. On 6 April a bomb attack took place at Ebrington Barracks in Derry. RIRA members lowered a device consisting of 5lb of homemade explosives over the perimeter fence using ropes, and the bomb subsequently exploded damaging the fence and an unmanned guardhouse.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 7November 1974, the children's nanny, Sandra Rivett, was bludgeoned {{to death in the}} {{basement}} of the Lucan family home. Lady Lucan was also attacked; she later identified Lucan as her assailant. As the police began their murder investigation, Lucan telephoned his mother, asking her to collect the children, and then drove a borrowed Ford Corsair to a friend's house in Uckfield, East Sussex. Hours later, he left the property and vanished without trace. The car was found abandoned in Newhaven, its interior stained with blood and its boot containing a piece of bandaged lead pipe <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> found at the crime scene. A warrant for Lucan's arrest was issued a few days later, and in his absence the inquest into Rivett's death named him as her murderer, the last occasion in Britain a coroner's court did so.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the best}} known of these tells of a {{stranger}} who arrived at the club on a stormy night. Invited in, he joined the members in a card game. One player dropped his card on the floor and when he bent under the table to retrieve it noticed that the stranger had a cloven hoof. At this point the visitor disappeared in a ball of flame. This story, which is found in texts from at least the 1930s, is very <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> associated with Loftus Hall, County Wexford. The Loftus family owned a hunting lodge – known as Dolly Mount – which was also to be found on Mount Pelier Hill.|$|E
5|$|The turuma's {{design was}} very <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> {{of the other}} types of {{archipelago}} frigates, the hemmema. The primary difference was that hemmemas were rowed from the gundeck, providing the oarsmen with better leverage by placing them closer to the waterline. The later hemmemas were also considerably larger, more heavily armed and of a more robust construction. Naval historian Jan Glete has gone as describing them as variations on the same type, especially when considering the pre-war designs. The crew varied between 220 and 266, depending on the model. Between 128 and 152 of these were required to man all the oars.|$|E

5|$|There are {{potential}} problems when the MSE is applied in a cross-cultural context, when the clinician and patient are from different cultural backgrounds. For example, the patient's culture might have different norms for appearance, behavior and display of emotions. Culturally normative spiritual and religious beliefs {{need to be}} distinguished from delusions and hallucinations - these may seem <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> who does not understand that they have different roots. Cognitive assessment must also take the patient's language and educational background into account. Clinician's racial bias is another potential confounder.|$|E
5|$|Xu Xing of the Chinese Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) in Beijing, {{along with}} Peter Makovicky, {{formerly}} of the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York City and others, published a cladistic analysis in the 2002 description of Liaoceratops. This analysis is very <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> published by Makovicky in 2001. Makovicky, who currently works at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, also included this analysis in his 2002 doctoral thesis. Xu and other colleagues added Yinlong to this analysis in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Abraham Lincoln {{was assassinated}} by John Wilkes Booth on Good Friday, April 14, 1865, while {{attending}} a play at Ford's Theatre as the American Civil War was {{drawing to a}} close. The assassination occurred {{five days after the}} surrender of Robert E. Lee and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service. In 1864, Booth formulated a plan (very <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> of Thomas N. Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy) to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president. Learning that the President and Grant would be attending Ford's Theatre, Booth formulated a plan with co-conspirators to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at the theater, as well as Vice President Johnson and Secretary of State Seward at their homes. Without his main bodyguard, Ward Hill Lamon, Lincoln left to attend the play Our American Cousin on April 14. At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} {{that at one}} time the manuscript was in the possession of Cardinal Bessarion, because the minuscule supplement has a text <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> of Bessarion's manuscripts. T. C. Skeat believes that Bessarion's mentor, the patriarchal notary in Constantinople John Chortasmenos, had the book brought to Rome from Constantinople {{around the time of the}} fall of the Byzantine Empire. According to Paul Canart, the decorative initials added to the manuscript in the Middle Ages are reminiscent of Constantinopolitan decoration of the 10th century, but the poor execution gives the impression they were added in the 11th or 12th century, and likely not before the 12th century in light of the way they appear in connection with notes in a minuscule hand at the beginning of the book of Daniel. T. C. Skeat, a paleographer at the British Museum, first argued that Codex Vaticanus was among the 50 Bibles that the Emperor Constantine I ordered Eusebius of Caesarea to produce. The similarity of the text with the papyri and Coptic version (including some letter formation), parallels with Athanasius' canon of 367 suggest an Egyptian or Alexandrian origin.|$|E
5|$|Many of Tom Swift's fictional inventions {{describe}} actual {{technological developments}} or predate technologies now considered commonplace. Tom Swift Among the Diamond Makers (1911) {{was based on}} Charles Parsons's attempts to synthesize diamonds using electric current. Tom Swift and His Photo Telephone was published in 1912. Sending photographs by telephone was not fully developed until 1925. Tom Swift and His Wizard Camera (1912) features a portable movie camera, not invented until 1923. Tom Swift and His Electric Locomotive (1922) was published {{two years before the}} Central Railroad of New Jersey began using the first diesel electric locomotive. The house on wheels that Tom invents for 1929's Tom Swift and His House on Wheels pre-dated the first house trailer by a year.Tom Swift and His Diving Seacopter (1952) features a flying submarine <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> planned by the United States Department of Defense four years later in 1956,. Other inventions of Tom's have not happened, such as the device for silencing airplane engines that he invents in Tom Swift and His Magnetic Silencer (1941).|$|E
5|$|Orthrozanclus reburrus ("Dawn scythe with bristling hair") was {{discovered}} in 2006 and formally described in 2007. This animal had a soft, unarmored underside, but the upward-facing surfaces were armored by: a small shell, near the front end; three zones of armor plates, which fitted close to the body and one of which ran all the way round the animal; 16 to 20 long, upwards-curving spines {{on each side of}} the body. The arrangement of Orthrozanclus′ armor plates is very similar to that of its Burgess Shale contemporary Wiwaxia. Its shell is very <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> of the two Burgess Shale shell types labelled Oikozetetes; the forward shell of halkieriids, most fossils of which are dated to the Early Cambrian; and those of other Early Cambrian fossils such as Ocruranus and Eohalobia. These similarities suggest that Orthrozanclus was an intermediate form between Wiwaxia and the Halkieriids and that all three of these taxa formed a clade, in other words a group that consists of a common ancestor and all of its descendants. So Orthrozanclus was also drawn into the complex debate about whether Wiwaxia is more closely related to molluscs or to polychaete worms.|$|E
