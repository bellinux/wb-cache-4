5000|$|A delayed surface {{marker buoy}} (DSMB), {{decompression}} buoy or deco buoy {{is similar to}} a surface marker buoy but is deployed whilst the diver is submerged and generally only {{towards the end of the}} dive. The buoy marks the diver's position underwater so the boat <b>safety</b> <b>cover</b> can locate the diver even though the diver may have drifted some distance from the dive site while doing decompression stops. A reel and line connect the buoy on the surface to the diver beneath the surface. Alternative means of marking one's position while doing decompression stops are diving shots and decompression trapezes.|$|E
50|$|These covers are {{typically}} attached all winter, by hooked bungee cords or hooked springs {{connected to the}} pool deck, and are usually made {{in a variety of}} materials including coated or laminated vinyl or polypropylene mesh. They are custom designed to stop leaf debris from entering the pool but more importantly they also provide safety for animals and small children when designed and installed properly. The custom <b>safety</b> <b>cover</b> was invented in 1957 by Fred Meyer Jr. of Meyco Pool Covers when he found a dead animal in his pool. Today covers are made to meet ASTM safety barrier standards and have kept animals, people and even large vehicles out of the pool. They are not popular in warmer climates, due to the five to ten minutes it takes to fit/remove them, making them inconvenient for repeated application and removal.|$|E
50|$|The inaugural race {{took place}} in 1973, when {{it was called the}} Bens of Jura Fell Race. The founder was George Broderick who, after {{recognising}} the potential for a tough fell race on the island during a visit there in 1970, returned the following year to carry out further investigation. It was intended to hold the first race in 1972, with the Glasgow and Strathclyde Officers' Training Corps having agreed to control the radio communications for the race. However, difficulty in securing suitable rescue cover for the day of the race led to postponement until 14 July 1973. The event was held again in both 1974 and 1975 but a low number of entries for the 1976 race, coupled with concerns over the dependability of the <b>safety</b> <b>cover</b> on the mountain summits, resulting in the race being cancelled.|$|E

The priority that ranked the highest was pest management with 30 % of respondents choosing this as their primary challenge in vegetable production. Cucurbit was the crop that gave respondents the most problems. The second biggest priority for vegetable growers was wildlife management, specifically deer in sweet corn, followed by damage to cucurbits. For rankings of all priorities see the results and Appendices below.

30|$|Many studies into port safety {{focus on}} many {{specific}} aspects and shed much light on how safety {{can be improved}} and what {{the underlying causes of}} accidents can be. Nevertheless, these studies, and any study, are faced with the complexities of gathering data in a field whereby some may be withheld for lawsuits, and where some data may be missed. For example, the above case study of Kaohsiung would suggest that where CCTV coverage is not comprehensive, or when {{there is a lack of}} police personnel, some infringements may go amiss. Furthermore, although these studies shed valuable light on many factors, it is possible that the interrelated nature of all the elements involved in contributing to port safety mean that it would be fruitful for more holistic studies to be undertaken. As the above results show, in Kaohsiung, the approaches to port <b>safety</b> <b>cover</b> all these areas, and practices are very thorough with regard to following international regulations, updating facilities, ascertaining who is responsible for which area, attempting to respond to force majeure events, and in ensuring due diligence and governance. However, it may well be the case that it is the complex interconnection of force majeure events, the state of facilities, human factors, governance policies and the implementation of international regulations that, when combined, all contribute to port safety. With regard to the value of the above findings for port operators and government officials, we would argue that what the above shows is the complex interrelated nature of all the elements we have looked at, and how it is important to be aware of this in any approach to risk reduction and port safety. We do not, however, make the claim that the full extent and impact of these factors on port safety is revealed by our study. Rather, we argue, in line with the recommendations of the literature [35, 46] that the above study represents a qualitative study that shows the need for more in-depth semi-quantitative and quantitative studies to fully explore the relationships between the factors involved. Moreover, that the results can be considered as key to aiding city development, but to be contextualized within appropriate theories and planning to help achieve practical implementation [1]. In this way they can be most effectively integrated into an overall process designed to consider port safety as part of developing the city for the future.|$|E

Temporal logics and for-mal verification assure functional correctness. Formal safety analysis techniques give rigorous proof of cause-consequence relationships. finally statistical mod-els and mathematical optimization help to minimize risk and give advice for design decisions. In this paper we sketch an example and illustrate how such an integrated approach can be done and what benefits it provides...|$|R
