5|$|Oak <b>savanna</b> {{is a type}} of {{grassland}} with scattered oak trees, {{found on}} the lowest slopes of the Table Rocks. The Takelma tribe often set fires in the oak <b>savanna</b> and chaparral regions to prevent brush overgrowth, creating foraging areas for animals such as deer and elk. It also prevented large wildfires. Oregon white oak and ponderosa pine are the most common trees found in the region. Buckbrush, sticky whiteleaf manzanita, Pacific madrone, deerbrush, birchleaf mountain mahogany, and Pacific poison oak are also common.|$|E
5|$|The Plum River raid was a bloodless {{skirmish}} {{that occurred}} at present-day <b>Savanna,</b> Illinois, on May 21, 1832, {{as part of}} the Black Hawk War. Most of the settlement's inhabitants, except for a few defenders, had fled for Galena, Illinois, before the raid happened. A small band of Native Americans, either Sauk or Fox, attacked the settlement while only three of the six defenders were present. The men who were present fell back to the blockhouse and a firefight ensued for about one hour, after which the attackers withdrew. No one was killed or injured during the attack, but in its aftermath Colonel James M. Strode dispatched a detachment of militia to <b>Savanna.</b> They returned to Galena without incident and the settlement at <b>Savanna</b> was temporarily abandoned.|$|E
25|$|Flooded <b>savannas</b> are <b>savannas</b> {{that are}} flooded {{seasonally}} or year-round. They are classified with flooded <b>savannas</b> as the flooded grasslands and <b>savannas</b> biome, which occurs {{mostly in the}} tropics and subtropics.|$|R
25|$|Temperate <b>savannas</b> are {{mid-latitude}} <b>savannas</b> with wetter {{summers and}} drier winters. They are classified with temperate <b>savannas</b> and shrublands as the temperate grasslands, <b>savannas,</b> and shrublands biome, that for example cover {{much of the}} Great Plains of the United States. (See {{areas such as the}} Central forest-grasslands transition).|$|R
30|$|Open {{habitats}} specifically included open woods, mesic open woods, dry open woods, semi-open dry woods, low open woods, sparsely wooded areas, dry open oak woods, prairies, acid prairies, barrens, bogs (i.e., fire-maintained bogs of {{the southeast}} USA), bog margins, borders of bays and shrub bogs, depressions in bogs and pine <b>savannas,</b> depressions in flatwoods or pine <b>savannas,</b> poorly drained pinelands and pine <b>savannas,</b> flatwoods, sandhills, <b>savannas,</b> pine <b>savannas,</b> pine seepage slopes, moist edges of scrub oak-pine barrens, wet pine flatwoods, and wet pine <b>savannas.</b> I assumed that non-native species were not indicative {{of any of these}} habitats, regardless of whether they had become naturalized within these habitats.|$|R
5|$|Chad {{has several}} regions: a desert {{zone in the}} north, an arid Sahelian belt in the centre and a more fertile Sudanian <b>Savanna</b> zone in the south. Lake Chad, after which the country is named, is the largest wetland in Chad and the second-largest in Africa. The capital N'Djamena is the largest city.|$|E
5|$|N. nigricollis usually inhabits <b>savanna</b> and {{semi-desert}} {{regions of}} Africa. However, {{they can be}} found at altitudes up to , as well as in tropical and subtropical regions of central Africa in moist <b>savanna</b> and cleared former forest regions, particularly near rivers and streams. Adaptable snakes, Naja n.nigricollis occurs in southeastern Nigeria where their habitat has been transformed from rainforest to man-made farmlands, plantations, suburban areas, and a few fragmented forests. This species of cobra has found advantages in the drastic changes which have taken place in Nigeria's rainforests. A study by herpetologist Luca Luiselli suggests this snake now forages in much drier microhabitats.|$|E

5|$|The {{habitat of}} the Cuban macaw was open <b>savanna</b> terrain with {{scattered}} trees, {{typical of the}} Zapata Swamp area. Cuba was originally widely covered in forest, much of which has since been converted to cropland and pastures. Lomas de Rompe, where the macaw was also reported, had rainforest-like gallery forest.|$|E
5|$|In Predynastic and Early Dynastic times, the Egyptian climate {{was much}} less arid than it is today. Large regions of Egypt were covered in treed <b>savanna</b> and traversed by herds of grazing ungulates. Foliage and fauna were far more {{prolific}} in all environs and the Nile region supported large populations of waterfowl. Hunting would have been common for Egyptians, and {{this is also the}} period when many animals were first domesticated.|$|E
40|$|<b>Savannas</b> {{are one of}} {{the largest}} and least known {{vegetation}} types on the surface of the earth. They are so poorly known that they have neither been adequately mapped nor has their area been measured. However, the total area of <b>savannas</b> in the world may be almost 1 million square miles. In South America, they cover an area probably larger than any other type of vegetation on the continent. <b>Savannas</b> occupy over 20 % of the area of Brazil, as much as 100, 000 square miles in Venezuela, and not much less in Bolivia and Columbia (vide Shantz, 1954). Although <b>savannas</b> are larger in extent than the Tropical Rain Forests, they have attracted less attention. With the accelerating population increase in the world, <b>savannas</b> will become increasingly important for food production and settlement...|$|R
50|$|These grasslands are {{classified}} with tropical and subtropical <b>savannas</b> and shrublands as the tropical and subtropical grasslands, <b>savannas,</b> and shrublands biome. Notable tropical and subtropical grasslands include the Llanos grasslands of South America.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>savannas</b> {{are home}} to many rare plants, {{including}} at least two endemic species: Rhynchospora aripoensis and Xyris grisebachii. They also provides a habitat for several rare and threatened animals.

5|$|Prior to the 1940s, {{wildfires}} {{burned through}} the Little Applegate River watershed frequently. The United States Forest Service began fire suppression {{efforts in the}} 1920s, and a smokejumper station was built about 20 years later. Species that depend on fire to reproduce—such as ponderosa pine—declined in population, while Douglas-fir and white fir spread. Buckbrush and manzanita, normally chaparral plants, encroached on the oak <b>savanna</b> regions. The vegetation in the watershed continues to grow denser, making it more susceptible to insect infestations and disease.|$|E
5|$|Snakes {{such as the}} ringneck snake, western yellow-bellied racer, striped whipsnake, and Pacific gopher snake live in the oak <b>savanna</b> region. Birds such as the oak titmouse, ash-throated flycatcher, white-breasted nuthatch, western bluebird, violet-green swallow, acorn woodpecker, black-headed grosbeak, and American kestrel {{have also}} been found in this region. The rocks {{are known to be}} the northernmost place blue-gray gnatcatchers inhabit. Gall wasps live in this area, often {{creating}} galls in oak trees by injecting their larva into their leaves and branches.|$|E
5|$|The Ethiopian hare (Lepus fagani) is {{a species}} of mammal in the family Leporidae. It was first {{described}} in 1903, by the British mammologist Oldfield Thomas.

30|$|Our {{analyses}} {{indicating that}} seasonal fuel characteristics and weather conditions jointly contribute to determine fire behavior in these West African humid <b>savannas</b> {{is consistent with}} studies of Higgins et al. (2000) in southern African <b>savannas,</b> and Platt et al. (2015) in humid <b>savannas</b> of southeastern North America. In particular, in Lamto Reserve, fuel moisture and air humidity are highly predictive of fire behavior; these variables are relatively easily measured in the field. The models presented {{in this study are}} novel and could be useful tools for assessing and monitoring various fire regimes in the humid <b>savannas</b> of West Africa. To date, no other work is available {{that can be used to}} predict fire behavior in this region.|$|R
5|$|The Santa Rosa fossil site, where LACM 149371 was found, {{is in the}} Ucayali Region of Peru. The Santa Rosa fauna also {{contains}} fossils of various unique species of marsupials and hystricognath rodents, a possible bat, and some notoungulates (a unique extinct group of South American ungulates). The age of this fauna is unclear, and estimates range from near the Eocene–Oligocene boundary (~35mya) to the late Oligocene (~25mya). The Santa Rosa mammals may have lived in a <b>savanna</b> habitat that contained rivers.|$|E
5|$|The wet {{season is}} the main period of {{vegetation}} growth within the <b>Savanna</b> climate regime. However, this also means that wet season {{is a time for}} food shortages before crops reach their full maturity. This causes seasonal weight changes for people in developing countries, with a drop occurring during the wet season until {{the time of the first}} harvest, when weights rebound. Malaria incidence increases during periods of high temperature and heavy rainfall.|$|E
