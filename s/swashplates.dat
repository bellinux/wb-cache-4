50|$|Older model {{helicopters}} use three independent servos {{to manipulate}} the <b>swashplate.</b> The elevator servo is used to tilt the <b>swashplate</b> forward and aft (longitudinal cyclic), varying the aircraft's pitch. The aileron servo is used to tilt the <b>swashplate</b> left and right (lateral cyclic), varying the aircraft's roll. The collective pitch servo raises and lowers the entire <b>swashplate,</b> varying the collective, and hence the pitch of all the rotor blades collectively. An intermediate mechanical mixing system is used to transfer the control inputs from the servos to the <b>swashplate,</b> therefore the name of mechanical CCPM (mCCPM). This requires an elaborate system of control rods and levers, which often contains many ball bearings.|$|R

50|$|Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars {{are flat}} plates that can scan up to sixty degrees in any {{direction}} from directly ahead of them. By mounting an AESA radar on a <b>swashplate,</b> the <b>swashplate</b> angle {{is added to the}} electronic scan angle. The typical <b>swashplate</b> angle chosen for this application is 40 degrees so the radar can scan a total angle of 200 degrees out of 360.|$|R
5000|$|A {{principal}} {{disadvantage of}} the coaxial rotor design is the increased mechanical {{complexity of the}} rotor hub. The linkages and <b>swashplates</b> for two rotor systems need to be assembled atop the mast, which is more complex {{because of the need}} to drive two rotors in opposite directions. Because of the greater number of moving parts and complexity, the coaxial rotor system is more prone to mechanical faults and possible failure. Coaxial helicopters are also more prone to the [...] "whipping" [...] of blades and blade self-collision according to critics.|$|E
5000|$|At AgustaWestland and its partner companies, a {{total of}} two dozen {{full-time}} engineers worked on the project in a skunkworks-style of development at AgustaWestland’s Cascina Costa facility in Italy. According to Wang, those appointed to the team were handpicked, and were typically young and passionate; each member had a specific specialty in one area. The team quickly decided that, instead of pursuing an electric-powered but otherwise conventional airplane or helicopter, a more radical approach would be adopted: A twin-rotor electric tiltrotor, lacking any transmission or <b>swashplates.</b> Wang summarised the team's philosophy as [...] "Anything that is bordline impossible, we want to do".|$|E

50|$|The <b>swashplate</b> engine uses a <b>swashplate</b> {{in place}} of a {{crankshaft}} to translate the motion of a piston into rotary motion. Internal combustion engines and Stirling engines have been built using this mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] A raised <b>swashplate</b> causing {{negative}} collective {{blade pitch}} and thus down-force. Note that the control arms {{are on the}} trailing side of the blades, causing the raised <b>swashplate</b> to decrease the blade pitch.|$|R
50|$|Other <b>swashplate</b> {{and control}} design have been used. For instance, Kaman Aircraft {{helicopters}} {{do not use}} a traditional <b>swashplate</b> and instead operate servo flaps on the rotor blades to adjust the angle of attack of the blades.|$|R
50|$|Coaxial rotors are {{a pair of}} rotors mounted {{one above}} {{the other on the}} same shaft and turning in {{opposite}} directions. The advantage of the coaxial rotor is that, in forward flight, the lift provided by the advancing halves of each rotor compensates for the retreating half of the other, eliminating one of the key effects of dissymmetry of lift: retreating blade stall. However, other design considerations plague coaxial rotors. There is an increased mechanical complexity of the rotor system because it requires linkages and <b>swashplates</b> for two rotor systems. Also, because the rotors must rotate in opposite directions, the mast is more complex, and control linkages for pitch changes to the upper rotor system must pass through the lower rotor system.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design of}} the Abeille was {{directed}} by René Dorand at the helicopter division of SNCAC. An intermeshing rotor layout was chosen instead of a tail rotor design, following the examples of the 1939 Flettner Fl 265 and the Kellet XR-8 of 1944. Its twin, two blade rotors were driven by shafts which leaned out of the fuselage side-by-side. The rotor blades, which began some way from the hub, tapered strongly. Pitch and roll were adjusted from the control column by altering cyclic pitch via a pair of <b>swashplates</b> and yaw by changing the relative collective pitch of the two rotors with the pedals. Forward tilt of the rotor shafts was automatically linked to forward speed. A single lever controlled both the collective pitch and the throttle through an electrical link. The Abeille was powered by a [...] Renault 12S, an inverted, liquid-cooled V-12 engine.|$|E

50|$|A <b>swashplate</b> {{controls}} the collective and cyclic {{pitch of the}} main blades. The <b>swashplate</b> moves up and down, along the main shaft, to change the pitch of both blades. This causes the helicopter to push air downward or upward, depending on the angle of attack. The <b>swashplate</b> can also change its angle to move the blades angle forwards or backwards, or left and right, to make the helicopter move in those directions.|$|R
50|$|To {{control the}} {{collective}} {{pitch of the}} main rotor blades, the entire <b>swashplate</b> must be moved up or down along its axis without changing {{the orientation of the}} cyclic controls. Conventionally, the entire <b>swashplate</b> is moved along the mainshaft by a separate actuator. However, some newer model helicopters remove this mechanically complex separation of functionalities by using three interdependent actuators that can each move the entire <b>swashplate.</b> This is called cyclic/collective pitch mixing.|$|R
50|$|A common {{variable}} displacement pump used in vehicle technology is the axial piston pump. This pump has several pistons in cylinders arranged {{parallel to each other}} and rotating around a central shaft. A <b>swashplate</b> at one end is connected to the pistons. As the pistons rotate, the angle of the plate causes them to move in and out of their cylinders. A rotary valve at the opposite end from the <b>swashplate</b> alternately connects each cylinder to the fluid supply and delivery lines. By changing the angle of the <b>swashplate,</b> the stroke of the pistons can be varied continuously. If the <b>swashplate</b> is perpendicular to the axis of rotation, no fluid will flow. If it is at a sharp angle, a large volume of fluid will be pumped. Some pumps allow the <b>swashplate</b> to be moved in both directions from the zero position, pumping fluid in either direction without reversing the rotation of the pump.|$|R
50|$|The {{swashplate}} {{consists of}} two main parts: a stationary swashplate and a rotating swashplate. The stationary (outer) swashplate is mounted on the main rotor mast and {{is connected to the}} cyclic and collective controls by a series of pushrods. It is able to tilt in all directions and move vertically. The rotating (inner) swashplate is mounted to the stationary swashplate by means of a bearing and is allowed to rotate with the main rotor mast. An anti-rotation link prevents the inner swash from rotating independently of the blades, which would apply torque to the actuators. The outer swashplate typically has an anti-rotation slider as well to prevent it from rotating. Both <b>swashplates</b> tilt up and down as one unit. The rotating swashplate is connected to the pitch horns by the pitch links. Alternative mechanics to the stationary (outer) swashplate are the hexapod and the universal joint.Swashplates for helicopters having two rotors mounted on the same shaft are much more complex than the single rotor helicopters.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>swashplate</b> is {{a device}} that {{translates}} input via the helicopter flight controls into motion of the main rotor blades.

A variable-angle <b>swashplate</b> causes the pistons to reciprocate a greater or lesser distance per rotation, allowing output flow rate and pressure to be varied (greater displacement angle causes higher flow rate, lower pressure, and vice versa).|$|R

40|$|Although robust {{models of}} fluid film {{behavior}} between the slipper / <b>swashplate</b> lubricating interface in positive displacement machines have been developed, measuring this same fluid film thickness {{to a highly}} accurate degree inside a relatively unaltered axial piston unit has never been accomplished until now.
