25|$|The Chinese {{animation}} {{industry and}} access to the latest technology, such as 3D computer-generated imagery technology, is actively supported by the Chinese government and included in the latest national planning. In part this may be because of a desire to increase Chinese <b>soft</b> <b>power.</b> The same technology as in Hollywood is available and much postproduction is outsourced to China. Successful indigenous artistic creativity is seen as a problem and may be restricted by factors such as production being aimed at getting government patronage rather than public approval, censorship, and some story lines based on Chinese culture not appealing to foreign audiences. DreamWorks Animation, in a joint venture with Chinese companies, will set up a studio in Shanghai that may eventually get bigger than DreamWorks HQ, in part to avoid to quota restrictions on foreign films with China within a decade having been predicted to become the world's biggest cinema and entertainment market. Disney has also entered into a partnership in order to help develop the Chinese animation industry.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} how <b>soft</b> lens <b>power</b> affects rigid gas-permeable (RGP) lens {{power and}} visual acuity (VA) in piggyback fittings for keratoconus. Methods: Sixteen keratoconus subjects (30 eyes) {{were included in}} the study. Piggyback contact lens fittings combining Senofilcon-A soft lenses of − 6. 00, − 3. 00, + 3. 00 and + 6. 00 D with Rose K 2 RGP contact lenses were performed. Corneal topography was taken on the naked eye and over each soft contact lens before fitting RGP lenses. Mean central keratometry, over-refraction, RGP back optic zone radius (BOZR) and estimated final power as well as VA were recorded and analyzed. Results: In comparison to the naked eye, the mean central keratometry flattened with both negative lens powers (p 0. 05). RGP’s BOZR decreased significantly with both positive in comparison with both negative <b>soft</b> lens <b>powers</b> (all p 0. 05). Estimated RGP’s final power increased significantly with positive in comparison with negative lens powers (all p 0. 05). Visual acuity did not change significantly between the different <b>soft</b> lens <b>powers</b> assessed (all p > 0. 05). Conclusion: The use of negative-powered soft lenses in piggyback fitting reduces RGP lens power without impacting VA in keratoconus subjects...|$|R

2500|$|Most of the {{arguments}} that the President does not possess <b>soft</b> <b>power</b> stem from a strict interpretation of the Constitution and what are regarded as the traditional roles of the President.

In the context of the Constitution, the word advice does not carry its typical meaning of mere opinion or suggestion. The President is obliged to follow the Cabinet's advice. Thus, the President does not have any liberty to exercise <b>soft</b> <b>power.</b> Furthermore, {{it has been argued that}} since the President is elected to exercise the powers defined in the Constitution, the concept of [...] "political legitimacy" [...] posited by proponents would appear to be undermined by <b>soft</b> <b>power,</b> which has an unspecified and ambiguous scope.|$|E

40|$|Congress has {{significantly}} more constitutional power {{than we are}} accustomed to seeing it exercise. By failing to make effective use of its power, Congress has invited the other branches to fill the vacuum, resulting in a constitutional imbalance. This Article considers a number of constitutional tools that individual houses—and even individual members—of Congress, acting alone, can deploy in interbranch conflicts. Although the congressional powers discussed in this Article are clearly contemplated in constitutional text, history, and structure, {{many of them have}} received only scant treatment in isolation. More importantly, they have never before been considered in concert as a set of tools in an ongoing interbranch power struggle. This holistic perspective is necessary because these powers in combination are much greater than the sum of their parts. Borrowing terminology from international relations scholarship, this Article groups the congressional powers under discussion into “hard” and “soft” varieties. Congressional hard powers are tangible and coercive; the hard powers discussed in this Article are the power of the purse and the contempt <b>power.</b> Congressional <b>soft</b> <b>powers</b> are intangible and persuasive; <b>soft</b> <b>powers</b> considered by this Article include Congress’s freedom of speech and debate, the houses’ disciplinary power over their own members, and their power to determine the rules of their proceedings. Each of these powers presents opportunities for Congress to enhance its standing with the public, and thereby enhance its power. This Article aims to demonstrate both the ways in which these powers are mutually supporting and reinforcing {{and the ways in which}} Congress underutilizes them. In doing so, the Article examines a number of examples of congressional use of, and failure to use, these powers, including the release of the Pentagon Papers, the 1995 – 1996 government shutdowns and 2011 near-shutdown, the 2007 – 2009 contempt-of-Congress proceedings against White House officials, and the use of the filibuster, among others. The Article concludes by arguing that Congress should make a more vigorous use of these powers and by considering their implications for the separation of powers more generally...|$|R
40|$|SAX J 2103. 5 + 4545 is the Be/X-ray binary {{with the}} {{shortest}} orbital period. It shows extended bright and faint X-ray states that {{last for a}} few hundred days. The main objective of this work is to investigate {{the relationship between the}} X-ray and optical variability and to characterise the spectral and timing properties of the bright and faint states. We have found a correlation between the spectral and temporal parameters that fit the energy and power spectra. Softer energy spectra correspond to <b>softer</b> <b>power</b> spectra. That is to say, when the energy spectrum is <b>soft</b> the <b>power</b> at high frequencies is suppressed. We also present the results of our monitoring of the Halpha line of the optical counterpart since its discovery in 2003. There is a correlation between the strength and shape of the Halpha line, originated in the circumstellar envelope of the massive companion and the X-ray emission from the vicinity of the neutron star. Halpha emission, indicative of an equatorial disc around the B-type star, is detected whenever the source is bright in X-rays. When the disc is absent, the X-ray emission decreases significantly. The long-term variability of SAX J 2103. 5 + 4545 is characterised by fast episodes of disc loss and subsequent reformation. The time scales for the loss and reformation of the disc (about 2 years) are the fastest among Be/X-ray binaries. Comment: 12 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables, to be published in MNRA...|$|R

30|$|In this article, we have {{proposed}} four FFR schemes for layered video multicast over relay networks, namely Hard FFR, Traditional FFR, Soft FFR, and Two-step <b>power</b> <b>soft</b> FFR.

Simulation results showed that cell-edge users could receive over 10 % more video layers using the Traditional FFR, Soft FFR, and Two-step <b>power</b> <b>soft</b> FFR schemes than with the conventional relay scheme. These three schemes are each suited to a different distribution of users, and thus the selection of which scheme is most appropriate {{will depend on how}} the network of users is distributed.
