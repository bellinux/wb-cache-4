I have been indebted to nothing in Black which I have not ascertained by reference to the Italian biographer, and quoted nothing stated by Tasso himself but from the works. Black's Life, which is a free version of Serassi's, modified by the translator's own opinions and criticism, is elegant, industrious, and interesting. Serassi's was the first copious biography of the poet founded on original documents; and it deserved to be translated by Mr. Black, though servile to the house of Este, and, as might be expected, far from being always ingenuous. Among other instances of this writer's want of candour is the fact of his having been the discoverer and <b>suppresser</b> of the manuscript review of Tasso by Galileo. The best summary account of the poet's life and writings which I have met with is Ginguéné's, in the fifth volume of his Histoire Littéraire, &c.

Here we used eye-tracking to investigate the role of attentional deployment in emotion regulation success. We hypothesized that differences in the deployment of attention to emotional areas of complex visual scenes may be a contributing factor to the differential effects of these two strategies on emotional experience. Eye-movements, pupil size, and self-reported negative emotional experience were measured while healthy young adult participants viewed negative IAPS images and regulated their emotional responses using either cognitive reappraisal or expressive suppression. Con-sistent with prior work, reappraisers reported feeling significantly less negative than <b>suppressers</b> when regulating emotion as compared to a baseline condition. Across both groups, participants looked away from emotional areas during emotion regulation, an effect that was more pronounced for <b>suppressers.</b> Critically, irrespective of emotion regulation strategy, participants who looked toward emotional areas of a complex visual scene were more likely to experience emotion regulation success.

Both mouse and human pRB-deficient primary fibroblasts resulted, upon release from a mitotic block, in proliferating aneuploid cells possessing supernumerary centrosomes.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate whether this restoration of regulator cell function is the only mechanism in the prevention of diabetes by 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3. We tested therefore if 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 could prevent cyclophosphamide-induced diabetes, since diabetes occurring after cyclophosphamide injection is believed to be due to an elimination of <b>suppresser</b> cells. NOD mice treated with 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 (5 microg/kg every 2 days) from the time of weaning were clearly protected against diabetes induced by cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg body wt at 70 days old) (2 / 12 (17 %) versus 36 / 53 (68 %) in control mice, P < 0. 005). By co-transfer experiments it was demonstrated that cyclophosphamide had indeed eliminated the <b>suppresser</b> cells present in 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 -treated mice. Since cyclophosphamide injection did not break the protection offered by 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3, it was clear that diabetogenic effector cells were affected by 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 treatment as well. This was confirmed by the finding that splenocytes from 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 -treated mice were less capable of transferring diabetes in young, irradiated NOD mice, and by the demonstration of lower Th 1 cytokine levels in the pancreases of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 -treated, cyclophosphamide-injected mice. This better elimination of effector cells in 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 -treated mice could be explained by a restoration of the sensitivity to cyclophosphamide-induced apoptosis in both thymocytes and splenocytes, in normally apoptosis-resistant NOD mice. Altogether, these data indicate that the protection against diabetes offered by 1, 25 (OH) 2 D 3 may be independent of the presence of <b>suppresser</b> cells, and may involve increased apoptosis of Th 1 autoimmune effector cells. status: publishe...|$|E

However, tuning of the acoustical parameters in a hearing aid in order to optimize the speech intelligibility {{may result in a}} harsh and unpleasant sound. This is so especially the case in listening environments where intermittent relative high-frequency and high-level transient noise (e. g. chinks) are present. In this dissertation, a new approach to minimizing the unpleasantness experienced by hearing aid wearers from such transient noise is presented. The approach relies on the selective identification and reduction of transients carried out so as to minimally affect the intelligibility of contemporaneous speech. Simple and straightforward signal processing has been used, which means that the transient suppression method can be implemented {{as a part of a}} digital ear-level hearing aid of today's standard without exceeding the available computational capacity. For real-time evaluation purposes, a two-channel wearable master hearing aid (signal processing unit), based on a general purpose digital signal processor, has been designed. The evaluations conducted in this work, based on a software prototype implementation of the transient <b>suppresser,</b> show that: (1) transients having half the peak level of that of contemporaneous speech can be detected with sufficient precision; (2) a group of moderately cochlear hearing impaired persons showed, in a blind paired comparison test, a clear preference for the transient <b>suppresser</b> over a hearing aid with conventional signal processing; and (3) in a later test with another group of persons having similar hearing impairments, no negative effect was found from the transient <b>suppresser</b> on the ability to understand speech.

New less calcemic analogues of calcitriol are being developed, and some are under clinical evaluation. To investigate whether these compounds possess important differences in their action on bone cells, we have studied their effects [with and without parathyroid hormone (PTH) ] on the release and synthesis of the resorptive osteotropic cytokine, interleukin- 6 (IL- 6). MethodsMG 63 and SaOS- 2 human osteoblastic cell lines were cultured for 6 or 24 hours in media containing calcitriol, the sterols of interest, or 1 – 34 synthetic PTH. IL- 6 release was assayed by commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IL- 6 mRNA levels were assessed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. ResultsWe found that calcitriol and paricalcitol behaved in a similar fashion, resulting in increased IL- 6 release only at higher concentrations (10 - 7 to 10 - 9 m). In contrast, 22 -oxacalcitriol and 1, 25 -dihydroxydihydrotachysterol 2 stimulated release to a similar extent but at concentrations three to four orders of magnitude lower (10 - 11 to 10 - 13 m), despite being less potent as <b>suppressers</b> of parathyroid function than calcitriol.

40|$|Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF 2) is {{a genetic}} {{disorder}} {{characterized by the}} develop-ment of multiple tumors in the central nervous system. Recently, the NF 2 gene has been cloned and found to encode a novel member of the protein 4. 1 family which is thought to link integral membrane proteins to the cytoskeleton. The identification of the NF 2 tumor <b>suppresser</b> gene has allowed us to screen for pathological mutations in the gene. We have studied germline mutations in the NF 2 gene by direct sequence analysis of genomic DNA from blood samples of NF 2 patients. In the present report, we demonstrate a novel pathological missense mutation in a patient with NF 2, which reveals that the variant observed may affect important functional regions or alter the protein {{on a larger scale}} by affecting conformation or degradation...|$|E
40|$|MiR- 122 {{is a novel}} tumor <b>suppresser</b> and its {{expression}} induces {{cell cycle}} arrest, or apoptosis, and inhibits cell proliferation in multiple cancer cells, including {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) cells. Radioresistance of cancer cell leads to the major drawback of radiotherapy for NSCLC and the induction of radiosensitization could be a useful strategy to fix this problem. The present work investigates the function of miR- 122 in inducing radiosensitization in A 549 cell, a type of NSCLC cells. MiR- 122 induces the radiosensitization of A 549 cells. MiR- 122 also boosts the inhibitory activity of ionizing radiation (IR) on cancer cell anchor-independent growth and invasion. Moreover, miR- 122 reduced the expression of its targeted genes related to tumor-survival or cellular stress response. These results indicate that miR- 122 would be a novel strategy for NSCLC radiation-therapy...|$|E
40|$|Transforming Growth Factor-β (TGF-β) {{signaling}} {{in cancer}} has been termed the “TGF-β paradox”, acting {{as both a}} tumor <b>suppresser</b> and promoter. The complexity of TGF-β signaling within the tumor is context dependent, and greatly impacted by cellular crosstalk between TGF-β responsive cells in the microenvironment including adjacent epithelial, endothelial, mesenchymal, and hematopoietic cells. Here we utilize normal, weaning-induced mammary gland involution as a tissue microenvironment model to study the complexity of TGF-β function. This article reviews facets of mammary gland involution that are TGF-β regulated, namely mammary epithelial cell death, immune activation, and extracellular matrix remodeling. We outline how distinct cellular responses and crosstalk between cell types during physiologically normal mammary gland involution contribute to simultaneous tumor suppressive and promotional microenvironments. We also highlight alternatives to direct TGF-β blocking anti-cancer therapies {{with an emphasis on}} eliciting concerted microenvironmental-mediated tumor suppression...|$|E
