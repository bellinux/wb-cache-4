500|$|In Paris, Ahmadzaï worked obsessively to {{complete}} the recording of [...] "Impressive Instant", applying his characteristic sound mangling. He used the Antares Auto-Tune plug-in set for the pitch correction. Explaining that the audio processor kept the characteristic of the voice, he recalled that Madonna was not afraid to use it, unlike other artists; <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> to sing {{a little out of}} tune and vibrato. The song had LFO sweeps at its beginning, panning from its left and right, which created the backdrop of the track. To achieve this, Ahmadzaï used a Nord Lead synthesizer, passed through an audio filter. The bass used in the song was subdued, and did not contain any music in high or mid-range. Instead of using a Minimoog synthesizer, Ahmadzaï used a Korg Prophecy analog-modelling synthesizer which added a different texture to the song. Audio filters were used for the first appearance of a melody and Madonna's voice was processed through an Eventide 3000 harmonizer, finally adding effects from filters and E6400 emulator. Also, Ahmadzaï added his characteristic stuttering sounds to the song, explaining: ...|$|E

2500|$|In April 2015, Miller {{published}} The Story: A Reporter's Journey, {{a memoir}} that focused largely on her reporting {{during the second}} Gulf War. Her former colleague Neil Lewis characterized most of the reviews as [...] "unreservedly critical." [...] Writing in The New York Times, former Los Angeles Times reporter Terry McDermott wrote that although [...] "this is not a score-settling book," [...] he found it [...] "sad and flawed". Ιn The Washington Post, Erik Wemple wrote that the book's [...] "dynamic" [...] of [...] "Judy Miller against the world" [...] lends her book an aspect that is [...] "both depressing and desperate". A review in The Columbia Journalism Review called the book [...] "less a memoir than an apologia and an assault". In The Daily Beast, Lloyd Grove characterized Miller's work as [...] "self-pitying". Criticizing Miller's failure to fully {{take responsibility for the}} flaws in her reporting, Matt Taibbi wrote in Rolling Stone, [...] "Most of The Story is a tale of dog after scheming dog eating Miller's homework.... Mostly, <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> a lot of rotten luck. Or at least, that's how it reads. It's a sweeping, epic non-apology. Every bad thing Miller has ever been accused of turns out to be wrong or taken out of context, according to her." ...|$|E

60|$|Poor little Mrs. Peter! She was {{so anxious}} that she couldn't sit still. She felt that <b>she</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> to do {{something}} to warn Peter. She stole out from the dear Old Briar-patch and halfway to where Old Man Coyote was hiding. He was so busy watching the doorway of the old house where Peter was hiding that he didn't notice her at all. Little Mrs. Peter found a bunch of tall grass behind which she could sit up and still not be seen. So there she sat without moving for a long, long time, never once taking her eyes from Old Man Coyote and the doorway of the old house. By and by she saw Peter poke his nose out to see if the way was clear. Old Man Coyote saw him too, and began to grin. It was a hungry, wicked-looking grin, and it made little Mrs. Peter very, very angry indeed.|$|E
6000|$|Let those laugh who will; {{older and}} wiser {{men and women}} might have taken lessons of these budding heroes and heroines; for here all was honest, sincere, and fresh; the old world had not taught them falsehood, self-interest, or mean ambitions. When they lost or won, they frankly grieved or rejoiced, and wore no masks except in play, and then got them off as soon as possible. If blue-eyed Lizzie frowned, or went home with Joe, Ned, with a wisdom older lovers {{would do well to}} imitate, went in for another game of foot-ball, gave the {{rejected}} apple to little Sally, and whistled [...] "Glory Hallelujah," [...] instead of [...] "Annie Laurie," [...] which was better than blowing a rival's brains out, or glowering at womankind forever after.

6000|$|Accordingly they hiked. But to [...] "hike" [...] along a deep-rutted, pebbly lane in frail, silver-hued {{slippers}} {{with high}} French heels, {{is not an}} exhilarating performance. Rilla managed to limp and totter along {{until they reached the}} harbour road; but she could go no farther in those detestable slippers. She took them and her dear silk stockings off and started barefoot. That was not pleasant either; her feet were very tender and the pebbles and ruts of the road hurt them. Her blistered heels smarted. But physical pain was almost forgotten in the sting of humiliation. This was a nice predicament! If Kenneth Ford could see her now, limping along like a little girl with a stone bruise! Oh, what a horrid way for her lovely party to end! <b>She</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> to cry--it was too terrible. Nobody cared for her--nobody bothered about her at all. Well, if she caught cold from walking home barefoot on a dew-wet road and went into a decline perhaps they would be sorry. She furtively wiped her tears away with her scarf--handkerchiefs seemed to have vanished like shoes!--but she could not help sniffling. Worse and worse! ...|$|E
