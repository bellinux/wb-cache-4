25|$|Ragweeds are monoecious, most {{producing}} inflorescences {{that contain}} both staminate and pistillate flowers. Inflorescences {{are often in}} the form of a spike or raceme made up mostly of staminate flowers with some pistillate clusters around the base. <b>Staminate</b> <b>flower</b> heads have stamens surrounded by whitish or purplish florets. Pistillate flower heads have fruit-yielding ovules surrounded by many phyllaries and fewer, smaller florets. The pistillate flowers are wind pollinated, and the fruits develop. They are burs, sometimes adorned with knobs, wings, or spines.|$|E
2500|$|The {{structure}} of the staminate flowers has been interpreted differently. The original describers of the species, Aaron Goldberg and Cirilo Nelson, considered that each <b>staminate</b> <b>flower</b> was basically just a single stamen, with a flattened filament about 3–5mm long grading into an anther about 2.5mm long. Two staminate flowers from the original specimen were re-examined by Andrew Doust and Peter Stevens. They concluded that each <b>staminate</b> <b>flower</b> definitely had two anthers, closely pressed together. They were unable to make a firm choice between two interpretations. The first is that the staminate flowers are basically as described by Goldberg and Nelson, except there are two stamens with fused or closely pressed filaments and anthers rather than one. The second, which they preferred, is that Goldberg and Nelson's [...] "filament" [...] is actually a pedicel (i.e. a stem on which {{the parts of the}} flower are carried) and that their [...] "anther" [...] consists of two closely pressed structures each made up of a tepal with a fused anther inside it. Either way, the flowers of Haptanthus hazlettii have [...] "a morphology unlike that of any other angiosperm".|$|E
2500|$|Typha are aquatic or semi-aquatic, rhizomatous, {{herbaceous}} perennial plants. The {{leaves are}} glabrous (hairless), linear, alternate and mostly basal on a simple, jointless stem that bears the flowering spikes. The plants are monoecious, with [...] unisexual flowers that develop in dense racemes. The numerous male flowers form a narrow spike {{at the top}} of the vertical stem. Each male (<b>staminate)</b> <b>flower</b> is reduced to a pair of stamens and hairs, and withers once the pollen is shed. Large numbers of tiny female flowers form a dense, sausage-shaped spike on the stem below the male spike. In larger species this can be up to [...] long and [...] thick. The seeds are minute, [...] long, and attached to fine hairs. [...] When ripe, the heads disintegrate into a cottony fluff from which the seeds disperse by wind.|$|E
5000|$|The tops of {{the stem}} {{branches}} are occupied by plentiful spike inflorescences from March to June. The shrub is generally monoecious, with each upright inflorescence holding mostly <b>staminate</b> <b>flowers</b> with a few pistillate flowers clustered near the bottom. The <b>staminate</b> <b>flowers</b> have large, woolly leaflike bracts.|$|R

40|$|Andromonoecy, the {{production}} of both male and hermaphrodite flowers in the same individual, is a widespread phenomenon that occurs in approximately 4, 000 species distributed in 33 families. Hypotheses {{for the evolution of}} andromonoecy suggest that {{the production}} of intermediate proportions of <b>staminate</b> <b>flowers</b> may be favored by selection acting through female components of fitness. Here we used the andromonoecious herb Solanum carolinense to determine the pattern of selection on {{the production of}} <b>staminate</b> <b>flowers.</b> A multivariate analysis of selection indicates that selection through female fitness favors the production of <b>staminate</b> <b>flowers</b> in at least one population. We conclude that this counterintuitive benefit of <b>staminate</b> <b>flowers</b> on female fitness highlights the importance of considering female components of fitness in the evolution of andromonoecy, a reproductive system usually interpreted as a "male" strategy...|$|R
50|$|The {{leaves are}} 2 to 4 inches long, rigid, oval-shaped, irregularly toothed, and borne on small petioles. <b>staminate</b> <b>flower</b> heads are spherical with minute flowers. pistillate flowers have longer peduncles.|$|E
5000|$|A flower {{having only}} {{functional}} stamens and lacking functional carpels {{is called a}} <b>staminate</b> <b>flower,</b> or (inaccurately) male. [...] A plant with only functional carpels is called pistillate, or (inaccurately) female.|$|E
5000|$|The larger pistillate {{flowers are}} borne in dyads, {{similarly}} subtended by a triangular bract, {{and accompanied by}} a sterile <b>staminate</b> <b>flower</b> and two, two keeled bracteoles. The sterile <b>staminate</b> <b>flower</b> {{is similar to the}} fertile but is slightly contorted with empty anthers. The pistillate has a striate, cup shaped calyx with triangular, valvate lobes, and the corolla splits to the base into similar triangular segments. There are six epipetalous staminodes, with triocular, triovulate, scaly, ovoid gynoecium and three fleshy, divergent, rugose stigmas, attached at the base. The fruit is globose or ovoid, beaked, with apical stigmatic remains and covered in vertical rows or magenta to brown scales. The single seed has a basal embryo, a thick sarcotesta and a sweet, homogeneous endosperm.|$|E

50|$|The Ostryopsis-Carpinus-Ostrya subclade {{is defined}} by <b>staminate</b> <b>flowers</b> without a perianth, operculate pollen {{apertures}} with endexine not thickening at apertural region, a base chromosome number of 8, and a plicate leaf vernation pattern. Several characters, including glabrous receptacle of <b>staminate</b> <b>flowers,</b> smooth nutlet surface, and secondary veins extending directly into leaf teeth, differentiate Ostryopsis from Carpinus and Ostrya.|$|R
50|$|The {{inflorescence}} is a spike {{of several}} <b>staminate</b> <b>flower</b> heads. There are often some pistillate heads just below these, with some pistillate heads borne on lateral branches. The fruit is an achene covered in spines. The achenes are usually dispersed when they stick to animals. The plant {{has been observed}} to have a lifespan of about 50 years.|$|E
50|$|Carex rossii {{produces}} a dense clump, or solid mat of slender stems {{up to about}} 40 cm from a shallow network of rhizomes. The pale to dark green leaves are usually longer than the stems. The inflorescences contain one or more <b>staminate</b> <b>flower</b> spikes above more rounded pistillate spikes. The fruit is three-sided, and covered in a greenish or brownish perigynium.|$|E
5000|$|Despite bearing strong {{resemblance}} {{to members of}} the Plectocomiinae, in preparing illustrations for the palm survey Genera Palmarum, Marion Sheehan discovered a single sterile, <b>staminate</b> <b>flower</b> among the pistillate members. The absence of such a flower previously obscured its relationship with the Calaminae, which it also closely resembles. This find, despite its rarity, seems to confirm its placement in the Calaminae subtribe.|$|E
25|$|Stamens: Five to twelve. In <b>staminate</b> <b>flowers</b> exserted, in pistillate short, often wanting.|$|R
40|$|Two non-mutually {{exclusive}} hypotheses {{regarding the}} benefits of andromonoecy (producing perfect and female-sterile flowers on the same plant) are tested using Solanum carolinense. Results indicate that (1) <b>staminate</b> <b>flowers</b> are cheaper to produce than perfect flowers, even after correcting for their relative position in the inflorescence; (2) the resources saved by producing <b>staminate</b> <b>flowers</b> are not re-allocated to other fitness enhancing functions; and (3) the main morphological characteristic of <b>staminate</b> <b>flowers,</b> pistil reduction, does not increase either pollinator visitation or siring success of open-pollinated plants. These results indicate that neither the resource savings hypothesis nor the increased pollen donation hypothesis explains the evolution and maintenance of andromonoecy in S. carolinense...|$|R
5000|$|Calyx: Yellow green; <b>staminate</b> <b>flowers</b> campanulate, five-lobed, hairy. Pistillate flowers smaller, five-parted; disk rudimentary.|$|R
50|$|Ambrosia cheiranthifolia is a rhizomatous {{perennial}} herb growing erect to {{a maximum}} height around 40 centimeters. Several clones usually grow in a dense patch. The stems and herbage are silvery green with a coating of rough gray hairs. The oblong leaves are 3 to 7 centimeters long and oppositely arranged on the lower plant but alternate on the upper stems. The inflorescence contains <b>staminate</b> <b>flower</b> heads in clusters with a few pistillate heads in leaf axils below the clusters.|$|E

50|$|The flower {{heads are}} in a leafy panicle. The involucres are hemispheric to bell shaped. This species is {{dioecious}} (pistillate and <b>staminate</b> <b>flowers</b> occur on separate plants). Both staminate and pistillate heads are 3.5 - 5 mm long. Phyllaries are in 4-6 series, ovate, and glabrous. The receptacles are convex to conic and honeycombed. The <b>staminate</b> <b>flowers</b> range from 20-30 and there are 19-43 pistillate flowers.|$|R
50|$|Brasenia {{exhibits}} wind pollination. The flowers have {{a two-day}} blooming period. On the first day, the functionally female, or pistillate flower, extends {{above the surface}} of the water and exposes the receptive stigmas. The flower then recedes below the water surface and on the following day emerges as a functionally male, or <b>staminate</b> <b>flower.</b> It is elevated higher than on the previous day and the anther-bearing filaments are extended beyond the female carpels. The anthers dehisce, releasing the pollen, and the flower is then withdrawn below the water where the fruit develops.|$|E
5000|$|Acanthophoenix is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} palm family from the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean, where they are commonly called palmiste rouge. A genus long in flux, three species are currently recognized, though unsustainable levels of harvesting for their edible palm hearts have brought them all to near extinction in habitat. They {{are closely related to}} the Tectiphiala and Deckenia genera, differing {{in the shape of the}} <b>staminate</b> <b>flower.</b> [...] The name combines the Greek words for [...] "thorn" [...] and [...] "date palm".|$|E
5000|$|Flowers: April. Monœcious, without petals, the staminate spike {{naked in}} {{pendulous}} catkins (aments). The staminate ament buds are axillary and {{form in the}} autumn. During the winter they resemble leaf-buds, only twice as large. They begin to lengthen {{very early in the}} spring, and when full grown are about 1+1/2 in long. The <b>staminate</b> <b>flower</b> is composed of three to twenty stamens crowded on a hairy torus, adnate to the base of a broadly ovate, acute boot-shaped scale, green below the middle, bright red at apex. The pistillate aments are one-half to three-fourths of an inch long with ovate, acute, hairy, green scales and bright scarlet styles.|$|E
50|$|The inflorescences are {{round and}} head-like; they contain both pistillate and <b>staminate</b> <b>flowers.</b> The pistillate flowers have 2 to 4 sepals that are equal and fused to almost the tip, and one ovary. The <b>staminate</b> <b>flowers</b> have 4 sepals and 4 stamens. The flowers measure about a {{millimeter}} long. The fruit {{produced by the}} flowers are lenticular achenes and are enclosed by the calyx.|$|R
5000|$|Pistils: Ovary superior, hairy, {{abortive}} in the <b>staminate</b> <b>flowers,</b> two to three-celled; style short; stigma two to three-lobed; ovules two in each cell.|$|R
5000|$|Stamens: In <b>staminate</b> <b>flowers</b> {{as many of}} the {{divisions}} of the calyx and opposite to them; filaments short; anthers elongated, two-celled; cells opening by lateral slits; connectives hairy.|$|R
5000|$|In female plants the {{inflorescence}} usually features {{one main}} branch and the branchlets may grow {{from the main}} axil, the branch, or both. The branchlets are subtended by netlike bracts, often enclosing them, each small branch bearing up to 20 pistillate flowers, each flower held in two distinct bracteoles. A sterile <b>staminate</b> <b>flower</b> is usually absent. [...] The pistillate flowers are larger, calyx similar, with six staminodes. The filaments are joined to form a tube, the empty anthers flattened, gynoecium ovular, trioculate and scaly. There are three conspicuous fleshy stigmas, reflexed, with a basally attached ovule. The beaked fruit is ovoid to pear shaped, covered in reflexed scales, with a thin mesocarp. Each fruit carries one basally attached seed with a basal embryo.|$|E
50|$|Palm to 20 m tall, trunk to 26 cm in {{diameter}} and expanded at the base. Leaves about 3 m long with a moderate lateral twist. Crownshaft is green. Pinnae have silver/grey scales below and tend to be semi-pendulous in the apical 1/3. They lack ramenta on the midrib below. The infiorescence, branched to 3 orders, usually holds the branches erect though they become pendulous in fruit; it is usually wider than long and remains green with maturation of the fruit. Flowers are white/cream. <b>Staminate</b> <b>flower</b> has 13-19 stamens. Fruit is red/brick-red at maturity, 17-25 mm long. Fibres in the mesocarp are in two distinct layers, the outer with thin straight fibres, the inner with thick, fiat to 0.3 mm wide, usually held tight in the dried state.|$|E
