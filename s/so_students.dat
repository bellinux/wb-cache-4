25|$|Israel {{has closed}} {{schools in the}} West Bank for months during periods of conflict. In 1989 200,000 {{students}} were kept out of class from January to July. During Israeli curfews imposed during 2002 teachers and students created makeshift schools in halls, living rooms and alleys <b>so</b> <b>students</b> {{would not have to}} travel by car or bus to get to schools. Israel's separation barrier has separated some students from their schools, leading to long waits at checkpoints. In 2008 Israel closed two charity schools for needy children because Israel suspected they were tied to Hamas. Schools in Gaza also close during clashes, as during the November 2012 Operation Pillar of Defense.|$|E
25|$|Undergraduates at {{many older}} {{universities}} also wear gowns; {{the most common}} essentially a smaller knee-length version of the BA gown, or the Oxford Commoners gown which is sleeveless lay type gown and has two streamers at the back at Oxford. At Cambridge, most colleges have their own distinctive design of gown. This {{is not the case}} at the Ancient Scottish universities, such as the University of St Andrews, where the undergraduate gown is scarlet and typically features a velveteen collar. Undergraduate gowns are seldom worn (even in institutions that prescribe them) nowadays except in the older universities. Most new universities do not prescribe them since academic dress has fallen out of daily use <b>so</b> <b>students</b> would hardly, if ever, wear them.|$|E

25|$|Students that {{attend a}} nursing college {{or just a}} nursing school receive the same degree that one would who {{graduated}} from a nursing university, {{but they do not}} have the same educational background. The classes offered at nursing colleges and nursing schools are focused on more practical aspects of nursing. These institutions do not offer many general education classes, <b>so</b> <b>students</b> who attend these schools will solely be focusing on their nursing educations while they are in school. Students who attend a nursing college or school do have the opportunity to become a midwife or a public health nurse. They have to go through a training institute for their desired field after graduating from the nursing school or college. Japanese nurses never have to renew their licenses. Once they have passed their exam, they have their license for life.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, Wellington was {{expanding}} rapidly, and, due to the city's hilly terrain, good {{building land}} was at a premium. When new residential developments were proposed for Kelburn, it was suggested that a cable car or funicular could be built to provide easy access. In 1898, a number of people prominent {{in the development of the}} residential subdivisions founded the Kelburne & Karori Tramway Company. The plan was to build a tramway between the city and Kelburn, and link it by carriage to Karori, a settlement on the far side of Kelburn. The company began purchasing land for the construction of the tramway, and negotiated with the Karori authorities for a new road (now Upland Road) to link the upper terminus with Karori. In 1898, the City Council granted permission for the venture, on condition that it had the option to purchase the operation at a later date. The location of Victoria University of Wellington was influenced by the company's offer of a donation of £1000 if the university were located in Kelburn, <b>so</b> <b>students</b> would patronise the car when travelling between the city and the university. Several of the Company investors like Martin Kennedy were supporters of Seddon, who stalled on releasing land on the alternative Mount Cook Gaol site for the university, although this site was widely supported in Wellington.|$|E
500|$|As of 2009, the {{curriculum}} is accelerated for each group, which is separated by grade and age; students are instructed a minimum of one year above their current grade level. (For example, the first group is taught at a second grade level.) Students are grouped within their class to allow each of them work {{at the level of}} their ability, and they may work several years beyond their current level if they can do <b>so.</b> <b>Students</b> may join older groups to study subjects, which they are exceptionally advanced; however, age groups are usually kept together [...] "for social and emotional values".

According to student tradition, stepping on the [...] "PH" [...] will cause a student to become cursed, with the effect that the offender will fail his or her degree and <b>so</b> <b>students</b> are known to jump over the cobblestones when passing.

2500|$|Students {{may choose}} from 23 {{accredited}} undergraduate baccalaureate and 5 graduate master's degree programs offered through the university's colleges. [...] The University has developed new partnerships that expand {{the range of}} programs and resources for students. [...] Taking advantage of its location on the coast, the university's Marine Biology Department operates two research vessels: the R/V Sea Otter (a [...] twin diesel vessel owned by NOAA) and the R/V Tiger (a [...] outboard work boat). [...] In the fall of 2007 Savannah State teamed with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to offer a new course in environmental regulations, <b>so</b> <b>students</b> can deepen understanding of policy and implementation issues. [...] The program also helps them learn about specific environmental topics.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the free schools, [...] "pay schools" [...] also existed, particularly for education beyond simple literacy. Before the American Civil War, rich families employed private tutors. Other schools were funded at least partially by parents within a community, and they also had control over the school as a community. Some were known as field schools, because communities often built in a field by the community. After the American Civil War, the Peabody Foundation distributed funds to help construct field schools, as later did the Rosenwald Foundation, which established Rosenwald Schools in Virginia and other Southern states to assist in educating African Americans. Church groups also established schools, especially to educate Native Americans and remote mountain communities. Rev. Frederick Never established over a dozen in the Blue Ridge Mountains, of which Blue Ridge School still exists today. Baptist and other missionaries founded others, including the Manassas Industrial School and Rappahannock Industrial Academy. Some schools operated only in the winter months <b>so</b> <b>students</b> could assist their farming families; others closed during the winter months. Privately funded education also included private tutors or boarding schools abroad for richer or luckier families.|$|E

2500|$|McKenzie {{believed}} that students' daily activities needed strict structure and supervision. [...] "It {{is not merely}} enough to open {{the doors of the}} classroom and let the students succeed or fail as their own caprice, or even their own judgment shall determine." [...] "If guidance and control can save the student from present mistaken inclination and provides for his future and permanent good, the University has a solemn duty to perform." [...] Indeed, close oversight of students' daily regimen offered opportunities for early intervention in matters of academics and conduct, especially among weaker students. Hours were set for daily activities such as meals, sleep, recitations, and study periods, and attendance at weekly chapel and religious services required. Interactions between the sexes were carefully regulated and supervised, and girls were [...] "carefully chaperoned." [...] Strict routines protected students [...] "from themselves" [...] and helped direct conservation of [...] "every physical and moral strength" [...] <b>so</b> <b>students</b> can [...] "survive the scholastic tests which are put upon them." [...] In addition to promoting academic [...] focus, daily routines taught the lessons of [...] "regularity, promptness, reliability, continuity, and [...] thoroughness," [...] which are fundamental attributes of [...] "good [...] citizenship and moral and religious [...] character." ...|$|E
2500|$|Research has {{identified}} {{a number of}} demographic characteristics that appear to be important influences on cheating, including age, gender and grade point average. Older students, females, and students with higher academic achievement are less likely to cheat, whereas students involved with many extra-curricular activities are more likely to do <b>so.</b> <b>Students</b> involved in [...] extra-curricular activities may be less committed to their studies, or may have more demands on their time, which interfere with their studies, creating a greater incentive to cheat. [...] It has been found that younger students are somewhat more likely to cheat: one study finding the highest incidence of cheating occurs during sophomore year at college. Although cheating might be expected to decline with greater moral development, one experiment found that there was no relationship between how a student performed on a morality test and his likelihood of cheating (that is, students at a pre-conventional stage of morality are as likely to cheat as those at a post-conventional stage). [...] Higher academic procrastination was also found to increase the frequency of seven different forms of academic misconduct (using fraudulent excuses, plagiarism, copying from someone else in exams, using forbidden means in exams, carrying forbidden means into exams, copying parts of homework from others, and fabrication or falsification of data) as well as the variety of academic misconduct. This German panel study among thousands of university students argues that academic misconduct might be a coping-strategy to overcome the negative consequences of academic procrastination such as lower performance.|$|E
