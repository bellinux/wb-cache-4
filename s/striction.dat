The surface parameterization is constructed using the NURBS basis functions and line geometry.

All {{the advantages of the}} NURBS basis such as shape control and the local modification property are also applicable and bequeathed to the dual NURBS ruled surface. The problem of drawing the lines defined by dual unit vectors is also resolved. Towards this direction, we propose a simple technique to calculate the surface’s <b>striction</b> curve in order to draw the rulings of the surface within the <b>striction</b> curve neighborhood. The on-screen 3 D plot of the surface is realized in a pre-defined specific region close to the <b>striction</b> curve.

40|$|For the {{computational}} {{analysis of}} biological problems—analyzing data, inferring networks and complex models, and estimating model parameters—it {{is common to}} use a range of methods based on probabilistic logic constructions, sometimes collectively called machine learning methods. Probabilistic modeling methods such as Bayesian Networks (BN) fall into this class, as do Hierarchical Bayesian Networks (HBN), Probabilistic Boolean Networks (PBN), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and Markov Logic Networks (MLN). In this re- view, we describe the most general of these (MLN), and show how the above-mentioned methods are related to MLN and one another by the imposition of constraints and re- <b>strictions.</b> This approach allows us to illustrate a broad landscape of constructions and methods, and describe some of the attendant strengths, weaknesses, and constraints {{of many of these}} methods.

These concepts are interlinked and together define the nature of each of the probabilistic logic methods. Finally, we discuss the initial applications of MLN to ge- netics, show the relationship to less general methods like BN, and then mention several examples where such methods could be effective in new applications to specific biological and medical problems...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} efficiency of water development in Utah, including transfer systems, has seldom been examined, nor has {{the costs of}} public policies which result in deviations from efficient allocations. In order that public officials be better informed about water allocations, the present effort examines the efficient allocation of water in time frames up to 2020 under several alternative assumptions and calculates the cost of alternative policies. Us ing mathematical programming techniques, a computer mode l is developed to determine the supply (marginal cost) and demand (value of marginal product) relationships for agricultural water, given depletions for municipal and industrial (M 2 ̆ 6 I) and wetland requirements. The model maximizes net profit per acre t o an average agriculturalist in each of ten study areas in Utah. Proposed interbasin transfers and their costs are included in supply. The optimal solution gene rated is an efficient allocation, since maximization of net profits occurs only when value of marginal product equals marginal cost. The requirements for M 2 ̆ 6 I water are projected into the future using trending and probable industrial development. An efficient allocation (optimal solution) is generated by the model f or 1965, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 20 20. Th e timing of investments in water distribution systems can be determined from these solutions. Using alternative assumptions about policies (minimum inflows to Great Salt Lake and water salvage) several alternative temporal distributions are determined. Additionally, the effect of restrictions on groundwater pumping (present levels of storage must be maintained) are examined. The costs to users in higher supply curves (marginal costs) are approximated by areas between supply curves. In addition, losses to agricultural users from diminished efficient new production can be approximated. The critical factors in large proposed water transfers in Utah {{appear to be the}} growth of M 2 ̆ 6 I requirements along the Wasatch Front, particularly in the Jordan River Basin. Sufficient water is available in the Colorado River Basins to provide maximum transfers, full oil shale and power generation development, and efficient agricultural production. Restrictions on groundwater pumping and water salvage in the Jordan River Basin and maintenance of high inflows to Great Salt Lake make transfers necessary sooner. The costs of such restrictions approaches 25 percent of the total investment by agriculture in transfer systems. If no r e <b>strictions</b> are made, but investment in these systems occurs now, a loss of foregone returns to alternative investment equal to about 70 percent of the total agricultural investment is incurred by society...|$|R
40|$|Conservation {{rules are}} central to our {{understanding}} of the physical world, they place re- <b>strictions</b> on how particles can move and dictate what can occur during an interaction. However, it is often taken for granted how a conservation law is implemented. For example, “conservation of momentum” is the condition that the sum of incoming and outgoing momenta equals zero. In particular, we place a constraint on the momenta by means of a linear function. The assumption of a linear conservation rule is intimately linked to both the geometry of momentum space and locality of the corresponding interaction. In this thesis we investigate the link between locality and conservation rules in a variety of settings. Part 1 is principally concerned with scalar particles. We begin by constructing the interaction vertex for an arbitrary scattering process in a generic spacetime, showing that curvature is not sufficient to induce a non-local interaction. Along the way we develop a notion of covariant Fourier transform which is used to translate between spacetime and momentum space in the presence of a non-trivial geometry. We also explore the effect on quantum fields of explicitly imposing non-locality via the “Relative Locality” framework. It is found that the fields depend, implicitly, on a fixed point in momentum space with fields based at different points related by a non-local transformation. On the other hand, all non-local behavior in the action can be concentrated in the interaction term. In the second part of this thesis we generalize the analysis of Part 1 to particles with internal structure, specifically spin. Of particular interest was the possibility that the presence of internal degrees of freedom could provide a sufficient modification of the vertex factor to allow for non-local interactions. Utilizing the coadjoint orbit method we develop a classical model of the relativistic spinning particle called the “Dual Phase Space” model (DPS) which allows for a coherent analysis of the vertex factor. We find that in addition to locality in the standard spacetime variable, interactions are “local” in a second “dual” spacetime variable. Inspired by this overt “duality” we show that DPS can be reformulated as a bilocal model. Specifically, DPS can be realized as the relativistic extension of a mechanical system consisting of two particles coupled by a rigid rod with fixed angular momentum about the center of mass. Interpreted in this way the model is easily quantized and yields the correct values for the spin quantum numbers. Next we consider a spinorial parameterization of DPS which is entirely first class and reveals several insights into how spin affects the dynamics of a relativistic particle. In particular, we find that the spin motion acts as a Lorentz contraction on the four-velocity and that, in addition to proper time, spinning particles posses a second gauge invariant observable which we call proper angle. The notion of a “half-quantum” state is also introduced as a trajectory which violates the classical equations of motion but which does not produce an exponential suppression in the path integral. In the final chapter of the thesis we explore an extension of the Dual Phase Space Model which includes continuous spin particles. This extended model is then generalized to deSitter spacetime where we present a fully covariant parameterization of the model...|$|R
