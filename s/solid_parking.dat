50|$|Each of {{the four}} county commissioners {{represents}} {{an area of the}} county, or precinct, that is designed to be roughly proportional in population to each of the other such areas. In addition to serving as voting members of the court, county commissioners are often charged with overseeing county roads and bridges within their precinct, and are sometimes also responsible for <b>solid</b> waste collection, <b>parks</b> and other services within the precinct. In rural counties, the role of the county commissioner outside of the commissioners court tends to be quite substantial, while in urban counties, the delivery of county services is frequently consolidated in county-wide departments, with the bulk of a commissioner's time being devoted to the commissioners court. The commissioners are elected to staggered, four-year terms, with two taking office every other year, and are elected by the votes of the precinct represented.|$|R
5000|$|Municipal utility districts, {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "MUDs", {{play a significant role in}} Round Rock. Each is a special-purpose district that provides public utilities such as water, wastewater, storm water, and sometimes roads, <b>parks,</b> <b>solid</b> waste, and other infrastructure and services to the residents of each district. MUDs are typically formed by a residential developer as a means to install utilities and roads to a project when a city is not ready or able to provide them. The developer gets reimbursed over time from the fees levied by the MUD, and at some point the area may be annexed by the city to bring the development into the city's tax base once the basic infrastructure costs are paid off. [...] The MUD is represented by its own board of directors who are voted on by the residents of the district, and it has the authority to condemn land, add additional land area, and levy fees in lieu of property taxes to maintain the utilities and other facilities.|$|R

I is separand from the city by the green ring and Koliště street and i tis adjacent to the boundary of the zone of urban conservation area. The urban land is a point on the axis of Kapitána Jaroše Avenue leading from Lužánky Park towards the green ring of historic centre. I based the proposed project on the traditional shape of a house with an inner courtyard, which I adjusted to the shape of a corner plot. The aim was to create a sheltered quiet place. The proposal adapts by its height and scale and observes continues in the present street line. The aforementioned scale became the impulse for the distribution of construction materials carrying the 3 separately functioning solids. The aim of the proposal is to create three separately operating facilities that complement its functions. Creative work is accompanied by exposition of objects and subsequent sale. Therefore, the idea of produce, make, sell, translates into the functional design as workshops and studios, a gallery and design shop. The axis Kapitána Jaroše Avenue to the green ring intersecting the plot solved the shaping of the resulting model that supports this connection. The place is the completion of the axial connection between the two parks. Therefore, the land is covered with a green platform which penetrates among houses.

40|$|Proceedings of the 2011 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 11, 12, and 13, 2011, Athens, Georgia. Maintenance and {{improvement}} of Georgia’s infrastructure {{is vital to}} our economy, safety, environment and quality of life. To help assure that this infrastructure {{meets the needs of}} the citizens of Georgia, the Georgia Section of ASCE developed the 2009 Georgia Infrastructure Report Card. It was released in January 2009. As {{was the case in the}} previous report card (2003), Georgia’s infrastructure once again received an overall grade of “C. ” Eleven infrastructure categories were assessed: wastewater, drinking water, stormwater, energy, dams, school facilities, transit, bridges, airports, <b>solid</b> waste, and <b>parks.</b> This paper will focus on the condition of Georgia’s infrastructure within the following Water Resources categories: Wastewater “C” – Even though the City of Atlanta invested over $ 1 billion upgrading its aging sewer system since 2003, the majority of communities are consistently underfunding maintenance of their collection systems. Utility rate structures need to be adjusted to meet both capital improvement and maintenance costs. Drinking Water “C+” – While drinking water quality is good, much needs to be done to maintain the distribution system. There are also water supply concerns that were brought to the forefront during the recent drought. Reduced water revenues that resulted from required water conservation measures put the capital improvement programs of many municipalities in jeopardy. Stormwater “D+” – Some progress was made in the past five years; however, most of the progress was in planning with the development of the Georgia State-wide Water Plan and the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District’s Watershed Management Plan. Little has been implemented and most municipalities still do not have a dedicated funding source for maintenance of stormwater infrastructure. Dams “D” – As of January 2009, one-third of the highhazard dams in the state, which are dams that could cause the loss of life if they fail, were considered deficient. The Georgia Safe Dams Program was woefully underfunded and understaffed, which resulted in a dam failure analysis backlog of more than 500 dams. This is an area of critical investment need on the state level. Sponsored by: Georgia Environmental Protection Division U. S. Geological Survey, Georgia Water Science Center U. S.
