In order to compare {{language}} models, or to measure the quality of an acquired model with respect to an empirical distribution, or to evaluate the progress of a learning process, we propose to use distances based on the L 2 norm, or quadratic distances.

40|$|Abstract. Many {{practical}} and complex problems in industry and business {{such as the}} routing problems, scheduling, networks design, telephone routing etc.,. are {{in the class of}} intractable combinatorial (discrete) or numerical (continuous or mixed) optimization problems.

In the past few years, several modern metaheuristic algorithms that apply to both domains have been developed for solving such problems. They include population based, iterative based, <b>stochastic,</b> <b>deterministic</b> and other approaches. Classification can be made in two important groups of natural inspired and population based algorithms: evolutionary algorithms (EA) and swarm algorithms.

The material representation consists of a geometrical configuration based on a two-dimensional granular fluid, which shows to be suitable when studying nanostructure formation.
