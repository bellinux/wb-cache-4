50|$|Filming a car driving {{slowly in}} reverse, then playing the footage {{backwards}} {{at a higher}} speed gives {{the illusion of a}} car quickly approaching as the camera darts in front of it stylishly. Clever fades give the impression of time changes while <b>smash</b> <b>cuts</b> add tension <b>to</b> a scene in which the protagonist wakes up after passing out. Certain edits were also introduced to the film to time footage to different dialogue, adding certain information and leaving other information out. These edits are noticeable, as the actors' mouths are not always moving in sync with their dialogue. One particular scene, in which de Ravin's character floated toward the camera, used a green screen, but it was edited out of the film before its completion.|$|R
50|$|A <b>smash</b> <b>cut</b> is a {{technique}} in film and other moving picture media where one scene abruptly <b>cuts</b> <b>to</b> another for aesthetic, narrative, or emotional purpose.

50|$|A clichéd {{use of a}} <b>smash</b> <b>cut</b> is in {{a murder}} scene: the killer brings a knife {{plunging}} down into his victim, and just before the blade pierces the skin, the scene is suddenly replaced with a non-violent use of a cutting edge, such as the chopping of vegetables. <b>Smash</b> <b>cuts</b> are often used when a character wakes up from a nightmare to simulate the jarring nature of that experience.|$|R

5000|$|Smash cutting {{can also}} be used to comedic effect: for example, {{directly}} after a prediction is made, cutting to the future showing the prediction to have been humorously, and often outlandishly, wrong. One specific variety of <b>smash</b> <b>cut</b> is known in the United States as a Gilligan cut, so named for the TV show Gilligan's Island which frequently depicted a given character resolutely declaring his or her intentions immediately before a <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> a scene depicting the character doing the exact opposite.
