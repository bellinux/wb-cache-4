40|$|This thesis {{builds on}} {{previous}} research on effects of <b>price</b> presentation <b>order</b> on consumer choice. Previous research has used primarily offline stimuli, such as restaurant menus and sequential presentation of apartments to examine <b>price</b> <b>order</b> effects. This study adds online SaaS plan pricing tables as a new entry to that set of stimuli. Further, no previous study has examined the <b>price</b> <b>order</b> effect {{and the effect of}} a free choice in the same experiment, which is a novel contribution from this thesis to the area of research. A mixed factorial experiment design was employed, in which participants were randomly assigned to 4 treatments differing on the <b>price</b> presentation <b>order</b> and the presence of a free choice. Respondents had to choose a plan on two pricing tables. The two pricing tables differed on product category familiarity, the within-subjects factor, which tested results from previous research in the new SaaS context. Effects of <b>price</b> presentation <b>order,</b> presence of a free choice, and product category familiarity were tested against plan choice. The results confirm that <b>price</b> presentation <b>order</b> affects consumer choice, as found in previous research. Contrary to previous research, product category familiarity did not moderate the effect of <b>price</b> presentation <b>order</b> on plan choice, which may be a consequence of a weaker than expected manipulation. The presence of a free choice was not found to have an effect on plan choice...|$|R
30|$|<b>Pricing</b> and <b>ordering</b> {{decisions}} play {{crucial role}} in optimizing the costs of inventory systems. So, firms try to employ these optimal decision strategies to content their customers. Recently, many researches were performed {{in the area of}} supply chain by employing <b>pricing</b> and <b>ordering</b> decisions. For instance, Abad (2003) applied the optimal <b>pricing</b> <b>ordering</b> strategies with partial backordering shortage for a deteriorating item. Arcelus et al. (2005); Liu (2006) and Zhang and Bell (2007) considered <b>pricing</b> and <b>ordering</b> problem under various assumptions. Chao et al. (2008) discussed a distribution network design problem and utilized pricing and inventory policies under trade credits. Sajadieh and Akbari Jokar (2009) examined <b>pricing,</b> <b>ordering</b> and shipment policies in a two- echelon supply chain. Xiao et al. (2010) surveyed <b>pricing,</b> <b>ordering</b> and lead time policies in a three-echelon supply chain where demand is uncertain. Shao et al. (2011) employed pricing and inventory policies in a supply chain involving a supplier and multiple retailers for single product. Thangam (2012) studied pricing and lot-sizing decisions in a supply chain model for a deteriorating product where the supplier provides the retailer a full trade credit period for payments and the retailer offers the partial trade credit to end users. Noori-daryan et al. (2014) discussed pricing and inventory policies in a four-echelon supply chain composed of a supplier, a manufacturer, a distributor and multi- retailers under rework process. Taleizadeh and Noori-daryan (2015) determined <b>pricing,</b> manufacturing and <b>ordering</b> decisions in a three-echelon supply chain including a supplier, a producer and several retailers. Therefore, some authors as Sadjadi et al. (2015), Taleizadeh and Charmchi (2015), Esmaeilzadeh and Taleizadeh (2016), Vijayashree and Uthayakumar (2017) and Sundara Rajan and Uthayakumar (2017) surveyed optimal <b>pricing</b> and <b>ordering</b> policies under different settings.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} a {{decentralized}} supply chain {{in which the}} manufacturer sells a short lifecycle product using wholesale price (only) contracts to a price-setting retailer, who in turn sells it to the market. Our two-period framework captures the salient features of this product: Price-sensitive stochastic retail demand; non-stationary demand and cost parameters; correlated demands which enable updating of demand characteristics; and limited, but possibly more than one, pricing, replenishment and wholesale pricing (contracting) opportunities. First, we develop a benchmark model where the integrated chain can <b>price</b> and <b>order</b> {{at the beginning of}} each period. We then model four decentralized decision-making paradigms with increasing degrees of decision flexibilities: Neither <b>pricing</b> nor <b>ordering</b> recourse; only <b>pricing</b> recourse; <b>pricing</b> and <b>ordering</b> recourses; and finally, <b>pricing,</b> <b>ordering</b> and contracting recourses. A novel transformation technique allows us to analytically characterize all the five models, and reduce the complex profit maximization problems in each case to a mere one-dimensional search. Subsequently, based on a numerical study, we systemat-ically compare the values and behaviors of the optimal decisions for the five models. In addition, we offer managerial insights as to how optimal decisions behave temporally and how they are affected by system characteristics like price elasticity, demand correlation and demand uncertainty. A more detailed investigation comparing the optimal profits for the five models allows us to identify the values of <b>pricing,</b> <b>ordering</b> and contracting flexibilities from the viewpoint of the two channel part-ners. Our analysis generates managerial suggestions as to which decision-making paradigm might be most suitable for the chain depending on the business environment and on the lifecycle phase of the product...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, a {{discount}} model is proposed to coordinate <b>pricing</b> and <b>ordering</b> decisions in a two-echelon supply chain (SC). Demand is stochastic and price sensitive while lead times are fixed. Decentralized decision making where downstream decides on selling <b>price</b> and <b>order</b> size is investigated. Then, joint <b>pricing</b> and <b>ordering</b> decisions are extracted where both members {{act as a}} single entity aim to maximize whole SC profit. Finally, a coordination mechanism based on quantity discount is proposed to coordinate both <b>pricing</b> and <b>ordering</b> decisions simultaneously. The proposed two-level discount policy can be characterized from two aspects: (1) marketing viewpoint: a retail price discount to increase the demand, and (2) operations management viewpoint: a wholesale price discount to induce the retailer to adjust its order quantity and selling price jointly. Results of numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed policy is suitable to coordinate SC and improve the profitability of SC {{as well as all}} SC members in comparison with decentralized decision making.|$|R

40|$|Retailing {{channels}} {{are increasingly being}} dominated by 'power' retailers {{who are in a}} position to dictate <b>prices</b> and <b>ordering</b> schedules to manufacturers and suppliers. A dominant retailer, such as Wal-Mart, has the 'power' to decide retail prices of products because there are so many manufacturers who are keen to sell their products through or to such a large and powerful retailer. Several products, such as electronic products, can be sold in the market for some periods during their lifecycles before they retreat, except when they are not popular with consumers after been introduced. Therefore, in case of such products, the retailer should not just consider a single-period <b>pricing</b> and <b>ordering</b> policy. It should make dynamic <b>pricing</b> and <b>ordering</b> decisions based on market demand forecast, in order to obtain maximum cumulative profit from the product during its lifecycle. In this study, we consider this scenario and construct a two-period model to discuss <b>pricing</b> and <b>ordering</b> problems for a dominant retailer with demand uncertainty in a declining price environment. We show that the maximum expected profit function is continuous concave, so the optimal solution to <b>pricing</b> and <b>ordering</b> policy exists and it is the one and only. We also analyze sensitivity of retailer's expected profit to the effects of parameters of price-discount sharing scheme and market demand. Dominant retailer Demand uncertainty Optimization...|$|R
