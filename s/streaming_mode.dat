30|$|As {{the mode}} {{switching}} between single stream and dual streams is {{done at the}} user side based on maximizing SE, one may argue that the chosen mode {{may not be the}} most energy efficient one. Interestingly, as the total power consumption is the same for the two mode according to the power model given by (4), the choice made at the user side can lead to the most energy efficient mode, which can be explained as follows. Comparing (11) with (19), we can know that the denominators of the expressions on the right side are the same, so the value of estimated EE is determined by the numerators. Thus if the sum of transport block size of the preferred MCS levels for dual <b>stream</b> <b>mode</b> is greater than that for single <b>stream</b> <b>mode,</b> dual <b>stream</b> <b>mode</b> is selected by the user, and vice versa. So the energy efficient criterion for mode selection between single stream and dual streams is the same as maximizing SE criterion.|$|R

Thus it improves the downlink peak data rate and system throughput greatly. For the MIMO technology in HSDPA, the so-called dual stream transmit adaptive antennas (D-TxAA) is applied, in which the Node B would select single <b>stream</b> <b>mode</b> or dual <b>stream</b> <b>mode</b> based on the channel conditions.|$|R

Padding oracle attacks allow the attacker to gain knowledge of the plain text without attacking the block cipher primitive itself.

The {{way in which the}} PCO is connected to the PC (e.g., IEEE1394, Ethernet, USB etc.) will dictate the maximum achievable speed and thereby frequency and resolution using this method. Block mode utilizes the on-board memory of the PCO to collect a block of data which is then transferred to the PC after the block has been recorded. The PCO hardware then resets and records another block of data. This process happens very quickly, but the time taken will vary according {{to the size of the}} block of data and the speed at which it can be transferred. This method enables a much higher sampling speed, but in many cases the hardware will not record data whilst it is transferring the existing block, meaning that some data loss will occur.|$|E

40|$|It {{is crucial}} for ATM to {{efficiently}} support existing data applications. One of the promising methods of supporting data over ATM uses connectionless servers providing a packet switching service in the ATM network. There are two primary methods for forwarding cell based datagrams in a connectionless server: reassembly mode, where the datagrams are reconstructed before forwarding, and <b>streaming</b> <b>mode,</b> where each cell is forwarded as it arrives. The two modes impact the packet loss probability at a connectionless server, the packet delay, the interleaving method used, the AAL used, and the buffer space required. This paper investigates the performance of two forwarding modes.

40|$|Work on the {{generalisation}} of cartographic line data, so {{that small}} scale map {{data can be}} derived from larger scales, has {{led to the development of}} algorithms for a variety of generalisation operations, including line simplification. A major objective when capturing linear digital map data is the creation of accurate representation of naturally occurring lines, using a minimum of processing time and storage. When paper maps are converted into a digital representation using manual digitising methods, one time saving method used is that of <b>stream</b> <b>mode</b> digitising. In <b>stream</b> <b>mode</b> the digitiser samples continuously as the cursor is moved along the manuscript line. Co-ordinate density in <b>stream</b> <b>mode</b> is usually determined by time interval, which can lead to the generation of surplus co-ordinate data. For a number of practical considerations this superfluous data should be eliminated. These considerations include: 1. Reduced storage space: this may reduce a data set by up to 75 % (Jenks 1989), which will result in faster data retrieval and management. 2. Faster vector processing: for example, a simplified polygon boundary will reduce the number of boundary segments to be checked for shading or point in polygon algorithms. 3. Reduced plotting time. For these and other reasons, a multitude of line simplification (conditioning) algorithms have been developed. There are many studies that have discussed the merits of different algorithms, these include McMaster (1983), McMaster (1987) and Zhilin (1988). These studies contain detailed descriptions of many of these algorithms. A brief discussion is given here of the major types of simplification algorithm.

User input is forwarded to the server, and the rendered images are relayed through a dedicated remote display protocol to the user’s device.
