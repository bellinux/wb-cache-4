40|$|Radioactive waste {{transport}} package {{was developed to}} transport eight drums of low and intermediate level waste(LILW) {{in accordance with the}} IAEA and domestic related regulations. The package is classified with industrial package IP- 2. IP- 2 package is required to undergo a free drop test and a <b>stacking</b> <b>test.</b> After free drop and stacking tests, it should prevent the loss or dispersal of radioactive contents, and loss of shielding integrity which would result in more than 20 % increase in the radiation level at any external surface of the package. The objective {{of this study is to}} establish the safety test method and procedure for <b>stacking</b> <b>test</b> and to prove the structural integrities of the IP- 2 package. <b>Stacking</b> <b>test</b> and analysis were performed with a compressive load equal to five times the weight of the package for a period of 24 hours using a full scale model. Strains and displacements were measured at the corner fitting of the package during the <b>stacking</b> <b>test.</b> The measured strains and displacements were compared with the analysis results, and there were good agreements. It is very difficult to measure the deflection at the container base, so the maximum deflection of the container base was calculated by the analysis method. The maximum displacement at the corner fitting and deflection at the container base were less than their allowable values. Dimensions of the test model, thickness of shielding material and bolt torque were measured before and after the <b>stacking</b> <b>test.</b> Throughout the <b>stacking</b> <b>test,</b> it was found that there were no loss or dispersal of radioactive contents and no loss of shielding integrity.

According to this process sheet, the sample crate was manufactured to do the <b>stacking</b> <b>test.</b> During the test, experimental data were recorded and processed. Applying inverse method combined with finite element method, the CAE model was quickly reconstructed on {{the basis of}} 3 D solid model. By finite element analysis, deflections of the model were computed. By comparing deflections to experimental data, elastic modulus of the model can be adjusted to meet the requirements. The research on elastic modulus will establish the foundation for determining CAE model and optimization of structural design of wooden crates...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} if the possible interpretations of the UN stacking recommendation could lead to different results. If this is possible the recommendation would need to be rewritten to eliminate the possibility of the same product passing or failing within the standard. The focus of this study was a plastic jerrican filled with water. The acceptable methods that are mentioned in the recommendation are the type of compression and the optional use of a fixture to simulate nesting. Each jerrican was filled in accordance with the recommendation and allowed to Condition in the testing room at 23 °C and 50 % humidity for at least 24 hours. The packagings were tested until an appropriate stacking load was placed on to the package. At these loads, the deflections were compared from each test set up as described by the UN recommendation. A statistical evaluation was used to compare the results from each set up with a single variable. This test showed that it was unlikely that the same deflections would occur with the different set ups and that unguided compression would have greater deflections. A long term <b>stacking</b> <b>test</b> was performed at 40 °C and showed that unguided <b>stacking</b> <b>test</b> would also have a faster creep rate. The position of the package under the unguided compression was also studied. A CAD image was used to control the position of the package as it was moved to specific offsets. This showed a 1 cm offset could greatly change the deflection and that the movement on the bottom of the plate would change the angle of the swivel platen. Digital Imaging Correlation (DIC) was used to highlight the internal localized stress. These stresses were analyzed in both guided and unguided compression. The different methods will give different overall deflections at the same load...|$|E

The <b>stack</b> <b>test</b> article contained twenty-four 75 cm active length Delta 8 scandiastabilized zirconia cells.

The Phase II POCD 8 R 1 <b>stack</b> <b>test</b> operated for approximately 410 hrs before being aborted due to a sudden decrease in voltage accompanied by a rapid increase in temperature. The POCD 8 R 1 test article contained forty-eight 100 cm active length Delta 8 scandiastabilized zirconia cells arranged {{in an array of}} six bundles, with each bundle containing eight cells. Cell development activities resulted in an approximate 100 % improvement in cell power at 900 °C.

By carefully selecting the raw materials for all three layers, {{it is possible to}} manufacture near-net-shape half-cells.

The primarily experimental work included contacting studies, sealing of a model stack, thermal and re-oxidation cycling. Also an attempt was made to correlate cell fracture in the stack with pore sizes determined from computer tomography. The contacting studies were carried out using pressure sensitive foils. The load to achieve full contact on anode and cathode side of the cell was assessed and applied in the subsequent model <b>stack</b> <b>test.</b> The <b>stack</b> experiment permitted a detailed analysis of stack compaction during sealing. During steady state operation thermal and re-oxidation cycling the changes in open cell voltage and acoustic emissions were monitored. Significant softening of the sealant material was observed at low temperatures. Heating in the thermal cycling loop of the stack appeared to be less critical than the cooling. Re-oxidation cycling led to significant damage if a critical re-oxidation time was exceeded. Microstructural studies permitted further insight into the re-oxidation mechanism. Finally, the maximum defect size in the cell was determined by computer tomography.
