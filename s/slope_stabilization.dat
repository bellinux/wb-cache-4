40|$|Introduction: Increasing public {{awareness}} of the desireability of protecting the environment from soil erosion caused by wind and water has centered attention on large construction projects such as highways and housing subdivisions, as well as on individual building sites and parking lots. If unattended, sediment produced from these areas pollutes surface water, restricts drainage, fills reservoirs, damages adjacent land, and upsets the natual ecology of lakes and streams. The search continues for products and practices that will prevent or lessen the amount of sediment leaving construction sites. Products currently in use include chemical as well as organic materials, and they are applied with varying degrees of success. Many designed to stabilize the unprotected soil for a long enough period of time for vegetation to become established are in wide use and are quite effective (Clyde et al. 1978). Moreover, applying organic material to the soil surface around shallow-rooted crops has been a cultural practice for many years (Russell 1961). Janick (1963) summarized the effects of mulching as conservation of soil moisture, reduction of surface runoff and erosion, reduction of evaporation, and possible control of weeds. Others (Borst and Woodburn 1942; Duley 1939) have indicated the value of mulches in reducing runoff and erosion. Mulching has been reported as superior to other treatments for reducing soil and water losses and stabilizing bare slopes before grass is established (Swanson et al. 1965). Gilbert and Davis (1967) and Blaser (1962), in studies of highway <b>slopes</b> <b>stabilization,</b> found mulches improved seed germination and seedling growth by conserving moisture and protecting highway slopes against erosion. Many materials have been evaluated for use as a mulch, including bark, wood wastes, soybean residues, wheat straw, and seawee (Bollen and Glennie 1961; Kidder at al, 1943; Latimer and Percival 1947). McKee et al. (1964) found wheat straw {{to be one of the}} best mulches, particularly when used to aid vegetation establishment on steep cut slopes of highways. Osborne and Gilbert (1978) also demonstrated that shredded hardwood bark mulch provided adequate erosion control on highway slopes. CONWED Corporation produces and markets wood fiber mulches that are intended to foster plant growth and inhibit erosion. The objective of this study was to evaluate, using simulated rainfall and sunlight, the effectiveness of various fiber mulches for controlling erosion to facilitate the establishment and growth of barley on a 2 : 1 (50 percent) slope...|$|R

The flow problem is solved using a mixed-hybrid Finite Element method. For the construction of lines orthogonal to the streamlines pseudopotentials are used. Pseudopotentials are evaluated using a standard Finite Element method. The grid generator determines stagnation points and uses local values of the streamfunctions {{for the construction of}} streamlines. Both interior wells and anisotropic conditions can be handled. The grid is used for the simulation of multicomponent reactive transport, using a Finite Volume approach with <b>slope</b> limiter <b>stabilization</b> of advection-dominated transport. The reactive sub-problem is solved by the solver for differential-algebraic systems DASSL. Coupling of reactive processes and advective-dispersive transport is done by the operator-split method.

The streamline-oriented grid leads to a significant improvement in the approximation of transverse mixing compared to a rectangular grid, leading to different results in the prediction of reactive transport.

40|$|The studies {{presented}} in this PhD thesis have the general aim to contribute in the understanding the complex and almost unknown “world” of woody root biology. In particular the work {{has been focused on}} two major issues: 1) root response to mechanical stress and 2) mechanisms involved in lateral root emission from a secondary structure. Results of these studies are described in the chapter I and chapter II. Chapter I. The response of Populus nigra woody root to mechanical stress imposed by bending. To investigate the root response to mechanical stress, during the first period of the PhD project an experimental system represented by bent poplar taproots has been set up. The first results obtained by the analysis of this experimental system are reported in the paper published by Scippa et al., (2008). The data obtained showed that poplar taproot responds to mechanical stress increasing the lateral root emissions, biomass and lignin content, activating stress-responsive genes and altering the metabolic pathways. Starting from these results, in the second phase, to dissect the mechanisms involved in the woody root response to bending a temporal and spatial analysis have been carried out. In particular after modeling the forces distribution along the bent taproot, the morphological and lignin changes were analyzed together with the alteration of proteins profiles. The use of 2 DE coupled to the MS/MS allowed the identification of 211 well resolved proteins which represent the first woody root proteome map. In addition all the data obtained at the different level of investigation were further verified and elaborated by multivariate statistical analysis identifying important temporal and spatial protein markers. Chapter II. Identification and characterization of an activation-tagged gene encoding an AP 2 /ERF protein that regulates lateral root emission. To investigate mechanisms involved in lateral root emission from a secondary structure, a suitable experimental system is required. In details, after screening of 627 independent activation-tagged transgenic lines in tissue culture, a transgenic hybrid poplar (Populus tremula X Populus alba), with dominant root phenotype, was identified. The cause of the observed phenotype was the hyperactivation (insertion of a strong 35 S transcriptional enhancer) of the gene encoding for a protein of AP 2 /ERF family (PtaERF 003). The root phenotype was increased through IAA application to the growth medium and metabolic profiling was characterized. The data obtained address the use of the transgene as model to further identify the molecular factors controlling lateral root emission from the secondary growth. In addition the possibility of producing trees with strongly lateral root phenotype could have significant economic and environmental benefits, including ensure of a good anchorage, <b>slopes</b> <b>stabilization</b> and reduced risk of landslides.

30|$|It {{can also}} be {{observed}} from the two graphs that FS increases in a linear progression with increase in either of the shear strength parameters. These linear relationships reinforces that dump waste materials obey Mohr–Coulomb principles [60]. However, the inclination of the FS is more noticeable with friction angle than cohesion for similar ranges of variation of cohesion and internal friction (Fig.  16). All the values of FS that fall below 1 (which is the minimum threshold value required to keep a slope theoretically stable) suggests that the slope is unstable at that values of cohesion and friction angles or have probably failed [27, 28, 30, 31, 32, 38, 60], and probably by circular mode. This suggests that the analyzed slope would be critically stable with cohesion at 40  kPa and/or internal friction angle greater 35 ° with FS marginally above 1.0. But, {{it should be noted}} that with FS equal to 1 or slightly greater than 1, the <b>slope</b> would require <b>stabilization</b> to increase the FS to 1.5 which is often recommended and normally used to augment for the inconsistencies in modeling. The method of benching (which help moderate slope height and angle) proposed by Maduka et al. [38] can be employed to improve the slope stability.|$|R

40|$|Biological (or biotechnical) {{stabilization}} of banks {{based on the}} stabilization effect of grass has a fundamental disadvantage for reinforcement constructions {{and that is the}} delay in their functionality. It starts to be functional only several weeks after the sowing and its full function can be usually guaranteed for as late as the following vegetation period. Moreover, grass carpets on slopes forming banks of watercourses are damaged by erosion caused by the flow of water in the watercourse but also water flowing down the slopes. Other damage is inflicted by “trampling”, i. e. the damage caused by the movement of people (anglers, rowers, hikers, etc.). This can be prevented to a degree by pre-grown grass carpets. These will bring about the stabilization effect sooner but the resistance of a pre-grown grass carpet is finally the same as when a suitable grass mixture is sown. Therefore, in need of functional reinforcement significantly more resistant than a grass carpet, mostly stone or gravel riprap on the <b>slope</b> above the <b>stabilization</b> toe is designed.

40|$|Slope {{stability}} {{is the major}} issues associated with the overburden dumps in the opencast mining scenario. Statistical data reveals {{that more than half}} of the accidents occurring in the opencast working are due to the failure of the slope and reason behind this is the improper design of the benches and insufficient works on finding the geo- technical parameters. The most effective and simple way to cope with the slope failure are precise determination of the geo-technical parameters of the overburden dump and then proper designing of the benches using numerical modeling, water pressure simulation, Limit Equilibrium Method etc. The most influencing factors that contribute to the enhanced slope stability are: cohesion and angle of internal friction. In recent year a new trend has come i. e. using of fly ash mixed with the overburden dump. There are few reasons and advantages associated with this, like huge amount of the fly ash being generated from the thermal power plants raise a serious question about their disposal besides creating adverse effects on the local environment. According to Ministry of Environment and Forest i. e. MoEF’s guidelines, any mine situated within 50 km from a power plant must use at least 25 % fly ash as its backfill material. In this project the stability of overburden dumps mixed with fly ash at KTK opencast mine of SCCL was studied. Coming to advantage with it is that optimum mixing of the fly ash with the dump raises the cohesion which imparts a better factor of safety than the conventional method of dumping. The reason for the increase in the cohesion of the fly ash and overburden dump mixture is fly ash has ability to bind the particles strongly. This project work exhibits the extensive study of the factors contributing to the <b>slope</b> stability, various <b>stabilization</b> techniques for <b>slope</b> stability, laboratory oriented works regarding finding the geo-technical parameters of the overburden and fly ash, and finally then optimum design of the bench of the overburden dump mixed with fly ash using the geotechnical parameters.
