6000|$|... "I now <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> {{the other}} letters {{from left to}} right are, M, M, a small d, A, a small d, and then the final B." ...|$|E
60|$|And perhaps they'll <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> however old {{the world}} is it's ever young, and that when all's said and done the most {{permanent}} {{on the face of}} the earth is what seems the most transitory--the ideal.|$|E
6000|$|Could you not re-write the story, and inject into it {{the social}} [...] atmosphere, {{and return it}} to us for further consideration? It [...] is <b>suggested</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have the hero, Van Sweller, drop [...] in for luncheon or dinner once or twice at ---- [10] or at the [...] ---- [11] which will be in line with the changes desired.|$|R
6000|$|... "Unless I am greatly mistaken," [...] he said, [...] "your long {{experience}} in such things has even <b>suggested</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> sir, <b>that</b> Miss Gwilt {{might turn out}} to be known to the police?" ...|$|R
6000|$|CHR. But did you think, when {{at first}} he <b>suggested</b> it <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> {{there was such a}} man to be found, of whom it might justly be said, that He never {{committed}} sin? ...|$|R
6000|$|This, Mitchy frankly showed, {{was more}} {{difficult}} to say, but he in time brought it out. [...] "Well, of appearing to <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> my existence, in a prolonged state of singleness, may ever represent for her any real alternative." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my dear, I merely {{wanted to}} <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Slope {{seems to think}} that if Mr. Harding be not appointed, public feeling in the matter would be against us, and that the press might perhaps take it up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was inevitable," [...] he declared. [...] "It is not, of course, a {{pleasant}} subject of conversation {{for you or}} for me, yet I think I may venture to <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> your sister's--er--indiscretions--have reached a point which makes a separation between you almost a necessity." ...|$|E
6000|$|The captain's voice {{checked the}} general {{outbreak}} of laughter. [...] "That will do, quarter-master. Let it be understood that nobody is {{to shoot the}} bird--and let me <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> sir, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> might have expressed your sentiments quite as effectually in less violent language." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} you would have said then,--how loudly you would have abused me,--had I not written! Would you not have told me then that I had not the courage to be open with you?" [...] He paused for an answer, but she made none. [...] "But I do {{recognise}} the necessity of my becoming subject to abuse in this state of affairs. I have been in no respect false, nor in any way wanting in affection. When I <b>suggested</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> £600 a-year between us, with an increasing family, and lodgings in Marylebone, would be uncomfortable, you shuddered at the prospect. When I explained <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would have the worst of it because my club would be open <b>to</b> me, <b>you</b> were almost angry with me because I seemed to imply that there could be any other than one decision." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Luncheon {{might have}} {{followed}} as an after-thought," [...] he replied. [...] "My real mission was <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should marry me." ...|$|R
60|$|I would <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> {{this is only}} a very extreme {{instance}} of the general state of affairs, that there may be finer and subtler differences of level between one term and another, and that terms may very well be thought of as lying obliquely and as being twisted through different levels.|$|E
6000|$|... "Really," [...] the Marquis expostulated, [...] "you are {{behaving}} {{in a most}} unreasonable manner. I am here to discuss the past. For any wrong which you may consider I have done you, I express my regret. I <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> your daughter's present position in life should reconcile you to what has happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive me," [...] he said; [...] "I do {{not like}} interfering with other people's business, but for reasons {{unconnected}} with myself I <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> {{it would be wise}} to stop this ship and get out the boats. The sea is calm; if it is not left till too late there should be no difficulty in launching them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{should be}} the last person <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should do {{anything}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> ought not <b>to</b> do to—” began Mrs. Bebberly Cumble impressively.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was just}} coming back <b>to</b> tell <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I loved <b>you</b> still. I was going <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> took lessons from some good professional. And I found you gone!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They did. You {{might have}} put it more harshly with truth. But I want <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{let me take a}} share in your venture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} understand," [...] said the master, {{slightly}} resenting the classification, [...] "that my reason for inquiring about the permanency of your daughter's attendance was {{simply because it}} might be necessary to arrange her studies in a way more suitable to her years; perhaps even to <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> a young ladies' seminary might be more satisfactory"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Mrs. Stringham {{presently}} brought out, [...] "I {{tell you}} all when I tell you that Maud asks me to <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> it may perhaps {{be better for the}} present not to speak of him: not to speak of him to her niece, that is, unless she herself speaks to you first. But Maud thinks she won't." ...|$|E
60|$|TWISDEN. Let me {{be frank}} with you. [Telling his points {{off on his}} fingers] We have your {{admission}} that you changed this stopped note for value. It will be our duty to inform the Bank of England {{that it has been}} traced to you. You will have to account to them for your possession of it. I <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> it will be far better to account frankly to us.|$|E
6000|$|Duke, this I'd say: [...] Events <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> us <b>that</b> <b>you</b> come up [...] With {{all your}} force, behind the village here, [...] And act as our reserve.|$|R
60|$|That's not so satisfactory--unless they contradicted one another; {{in which}} case I venture <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have grasped at all events the {{elements}} of the Egyptian problem.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I admit that; indeed, {{you might}} put it more harshly with truth. But I want <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{let me take}} a share in your venture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you {{are really}} not busy," [...] he said, [...] "I was about to <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> you should come back to town with me and lunch. I do not expect, of course, to take up your day for nothing," [...] he continued. [...] "You will understand, as a {{professional}} man, that when your services are required by the authorities, they expect {{and are willing to}} pay for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'As to looking, I {{have heard}} it said, Mrs Ned,' {{returned}} Mr George, angrily, 'that a cat is free to contemplate a monarch; and therefore I hope I have some right, having been born {{a member of this}} family, to look at a person who only came into it by marriage. As to eating, I beg to say, whatever bitterness your jealousies and disappointed expectations may <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> I am not a cannibal, ma'am.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I say, {{though there}} is not that tie between us, do not, I entreat, assail me with {{unnecessary}} taunts, or misinterpret what I say, or would say. I was only going to <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> {{it would be a}} mistake to suppose that it is only you, who have been selected here, above all others, for advancement, confidence and distinction (selected, in the beginning, I know, for your great ability and trustfulness), and who communicate more freely with Mr Dombey than anyone, and stand, it may be said, on equal terms with him, and have been favoured and enriched by him--that {{it would be a mistake}} to suppose that it is only you who are tender of his welfare and reputation. There is no one in the House, from yourself down to the lowest, I sincerely believe, who does not participate in that feeling.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I beg <b>to</b> thank <b>you</b> {{for your}} {{interesting}} pamphlet, and {{to add that}} I shall be very happy to accept an article from you on the subject[54] for [...] "Household Words." [...] I should already have <b>suggested</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> I should have great pleasure in receiving contributions from one so well and peculiarly qualified to treat of many interesting subjects, but that I felt a delicacy in encroaching on your other occupations. Will you excuse my remarking that to make an article on this particular subject useful, {{it is essential to}} address the employed as well as the employers? In the case of the Sheffield grinders the difficulty was, for many years, not with the masters, but the men. Painters who use white lead are with the greatest difficulty persuaded to be particular in washing their hands, and I daresay that I need not remind <b>you</b> <b>that</b> one could not generally induce domestic servants to attend to the commonest sanitary principles in their work without absolutely forcing them to experience their comfort and convenience.|$|R
6000|$|... "You have heard, no doubt, {{that his}} wedding ring has been taken. Does <b>that</b> <b>suggest</b> {{anything}} <b>to</b> <b>you?</b> Suppose <b>that</b> some enemy {{of his old}} life had tracked him down and committed this crime, what possible reason could he have for taking his wedding ring?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{should have}} thought this hardly the moment to intrude upon my sorrow,' he said at last. 'If <b>you</b> have condolences <b>to</b> offer, I venture <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> might {{conveniently}} send them {{by means of the}} penny post.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr Bold," [...] {{said the}} other, stopping, and {{speaking}} with some solemnity, [...] "if you act justly, say {{nothing in this}} matter but the truth, and use no unfair weapons in carrying out your purposes, I shall have nothing to forgive. I presume you think I am not entitled to the income I receive from the hospital, and that others are entitled to it. Whatever some may do, I shall never attribute to you base motives because you hold an opinion opposed to my own and adverse to my interests: pray do what you consider to be your duty; I can give you no assistance, neither will I offer you any obstacle. Let me, however, <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> you can in no wise forward your views nor I mine, by any discussion between us. Here comes Eleanor and the ponies, and we'll go in to tea." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'In {{the course}} of a few hours, my dear Bounderby,' Mr. Gradgrind proceeded, in the same {{depressed}} and propitiatory manner, 'I appear to myself to have become better informed as to Louisa's character, than in previous years. The enlightenment has been painfully forced upon me, and the discovery is not mine. I think there are - Bounderby, you will be surprised to hear me say this - I think there are qualities in Louisa, which - which have been harshly neglected, and - and a little perverted. And - and I would <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>that</b> - that if you would kindly meet me in a timely endeavour to leave her to her better nature for a while - and to encourage it to develop itself by tenderness and consideration - it - it would be the better for the happiness of all of us. Louisa,' said Mr. Gradgrind, shading his face with his hand, 'has always been my favourite child.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Now I do {{assure you}} most positively”—proceeds the epistle—“that I {{represent}} these matters fairly; {{and you can}} easily understand how restrictions so absurd on their very face must have operated, in those days, to retard the progress of true Science, which makes its most important advances—as all History will show—by seemingly intuitive leaps. These ancient ideas confined investigation to crawling; and I need not <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> crawling, among varieties of locomotion, is a very capital thing of its kind;—but because the tortoise is sure of foot, for this reason must we clip {{the wings of the}} eagles? For many centuries, so great was the infatuation, about Hog especially, that a virtual stop was put to all thinking, properly so called. No man dared utter a truth for which he felt himself indebted to his soul alone. It mattered not whether the truth was even demonstrably such; for the dogmatizing philosophers of that epoch regarded only the road by which it professed to have been attained. The end, with them, was a point of no moment, whatever:—‘the means!’ they vociferated—‘let us look at the means!’—and if, on scrutiny of the means, it was found to come neither under the category Hog, nor under the category Aries (which means ram), why then the savans went no farther, but, calling the thinker a fool and branding him a ‘theorist,’ would never, thenceforward, have any thing to do either with him or with his truths.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mr. Bascom, kindly, [...] "if {{you have}} any more I was going <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{distribute}} 'em round among the boys. That's the way I do, and most folks don't guess they're your bills. See?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Near {{the end of}} the hearings, lawyer Leslie Thomas {{confronted the}} police officer [...] "V59" [...] with the {{possibility}} that a gun had been planted, saying: [...] "I'm going <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> V59, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> knew where the gun was before the officers had gone round (the fence), because you, and all of your colleagues had planted it there." [...] The officer replied: [...] "I did not plant any gun at any scene. I find that highly offensive." [...] Thomas also accused officer [...] "W70" [...] of inconsistencies and omissions in testimony.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have sent}} her away," [...] Mr. Fentolin replied, [...] "until {{we come to}} a clear understanding, you and I. <b>You</b> seem <b>to</b> be a {{harmless}} enough person, Mr. Hamel but appearances are sometimes deceptive. It has been <b>suggested</b> <b>to</b> me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are a spy." ...|$|R
