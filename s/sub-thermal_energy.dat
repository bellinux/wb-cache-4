40|$|The dissociation-desorption {{dynamics}} of D_ 2 upon the Sn/Pt(111) surface alloy {{are dependent on}} the surface concentration of Sn. The p(2 x 2) Sn/Pt(111) alloy surface (#THETA#_S_n = 0. 25 ML), is initially #approx# 30 times less reactive towards D_ 2 adsorption than clean Pt(111). On the (#sq root# 3 x #sq root# 3) R 30 deg Sn/Pt(111) alloy surface (#THETA#_S_n = 0. 33 ML), increased inhibition of D_ 2 adsorption is reported, with S_o #approx# 10 "-" 5 at low energy, coinciding {{with the loss of}} stable Pt_ 3 hollow sites and a significant reduction in the D atom binding energy. Sticking on the #sq root# 3 alloy is activated with an increased energy threshold of #approx# 280 meV, with no evidence that vibration enhances dissociation. The barrier to dissociation remains in the entrance channel before the D_ 2 bond begins to stretch. Vibrational excitation is, however, observed in nitrogen desorption from the catalytic reaction of NO + H_ 2 over Pd(110). For a surface at 600 K, N_ 2 vibrational state population ratios of P(v= 1 /v= 0) = 0. 50 #+-# 0. 05 and P(v= 2 /v= 0) = 0. 60 #+-# 0. 20 are reported. Desorption occurs via the N(ad) + N(ad) recombination channel with little energy released into translation and rotation. The translational energy release observed is dependent on the N_ 2 vibrational state, with translational temperatures of 425 K, 315 K and 180 K reported for the v= 0, 1 and 2 states respectively. <b>Sub-thermal</b> <b>energy</b> releases and normally directed angular distributions suggest the influence of a trapping mechanism, recombining molecules scattering through a molecularly adsorbed state, with a transition state of large d_N_N responsible for the product vibrational excitation. Although N_ 2 dissociation on Fe(100) forms a simple overlayer structure, on Fe(110), molecular chemisorption does not occur at or above room temperature and the sticking is extremely small (#approx# 10 "-" 6 to 10 "-" 7). Activated nitrogen bombardment can be used to prepare a 'surface nitride' with a structure related to the geometry of bulk Fe_ 4 N. Scanning tunnelling microscopy yields atomic scale features that cannot be explained by simple overlayers. It is proposed that the uppermost iron layer reconstructs to generate quasi-octahedral sites between the top two layers, with sub-surface nitrogen in these sites forming a model for the 'surface nitride' structure.

40|$|Negative ion {{formation}} through {{electron transfer}} in collisions between K(nd) Rydberg atoms (10 ≤ n ≤ 110) and C 7 F 14 and 1, 1, 1 -C 2 Cl 3 F 3 is studied {{and provides a}} novel means to explore electron capture by these molecules at <b>sub-thermal</b> <b>energies.</b> The data suggest electron attachment to C 7 F 14 occurs through two channels, one leading {{to the formation of}} long-lived C 7 F 14 - ions and the other to C 7 F 14 - ions that experience rapid autodetachment. On the other hand, electron attachment to 1, 1, 1 -C 2 Cl 3 F 3 results directly in dissociation and the formation of Cl- ions. The present data are discussed in light of earlier results obtained with swarm and threshold photoelectron spectroscopy techniques...|$|R
