40|$|Abstract — Energy {{dissipation}} {{arrangements are}} the most important part in the design of a spillway for a dam. Various types of baffle piers and <b>stilling</b> <b>basins</b> have been tried so far. However, the hydraulic jump type-stilling basin is found to be the most efficient one. The main goal {{of this study is to}} introduce a ₒ shape of baffle pier, which has maximum energy dissipation. In this study, 14 different models of baffle piers were used for dissipating water energy downstream a heading up structure. One row of each model of baffle piers was used with a fixed position. Bed material used for runs was a uniform sand d 50 = 0. 8 mm. The dimensions of the scour hole for each run were measured and used for the comparison between the performances of the used models for energy dissipation. Results in general show that, models with concave surfaces make the flow to change its direction more than the others with low turbulence intensity in recirculation zone downstream baffle piers and dissipate more energy than other forms. This leads to a stable hydraulic condition and shorter <b>stilling</b> <b>basins.</b> In addition, the study shows that the vertical semi-circular section (model No. 7) has the most effect among other tested models for dissipating water energy...|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} of slab protection {{at the bottom}} of spillway <b>stilling</b> <b>basins</b> or plunge pools downstream of large dams came to the great practical interest when the protection under the hydraulic jump <b>stilling</b> <b>basins</b> in some hydraulic plants was seriously damaged by floods smaller than maximum design value. This thesis offers novel practical design criteria to define the concrete thickness of spillway <b>stilling</b> <b>basins</b> and plunge pools lining. In the case of spillway <b>stilling</b> <b>basins,</b> the study presents a new experimental procedure that can define the global instantaneous uplift force. Results from detailed experiments of the statistical structure of turbulence pressure fluctuations {{at the bottom of}} hydraulic jumps is reported. Here, the whole spatial correlation structure of the fluctuating pressure field is required in order to evaluate slab stability. This is computed via simultaneous acquisition of the point pressure fluctuations on a dense grid in the hydraulic jump region, requiring a severe experimental work. As an alternative, one can evaluate the pressure spatial correlation structure via auto-correlation using one point pressure acquisition and applying the Taylor hypothesis. To adopt the Taylor hypothesis, one must know the pressure propagation celerity in space that can be obtained by comparing the whole spatial pressure correlation with the pivot point pressure auto-correlation. The experiments were performed by simultaneous pressure acquisitions {{at the bottom of a}} hydraulic jump for Froude numbers of the incident flow ranging from 4. 9 to 10. 3. From experiments, a criterion to define the pressure celerity as a function of the incident flow velocity is presented. The results highlight a good agreement between the relevant pressure statistical parameters as measured and the ones computed using the Taylor hypothesis. The comparison between the slab thicknesses, as computed via Taylor hypothesis, with the ones retrievable in literature, as obtained by direct force measurement on instrumented slabs in laboratory conditions, highlights the accuracy of the proposed approach that presents undeniable practical advantages. While this simplified approach based on Taylor hypothesis is used to assess the pressure field acting on the slab, the pressure propagation at the lower surface of the slab is evaluated using a 3 D model based on unsteady flow analysis of seepage through porous media. By this approach, it is possible to consider the effect of finite thickness foundation layers, typical in the case of earth dams, rock-fill dams and in other dam types. Slabs with unsealed joints are considered and compared to the case of sealed joints. The dynamic behavior of anchored slabs is also investigated. These results are relevant to a robust and safe design and maintenance of <b>stilling</b> <b>basins</b> downstream of large dams. In the case of plunge pools, the {{stability of}} concrete slabs or rock blocks under the impact of an impinging jet is theoretically analyzed, with reference to the mean characteristics of the flow field: pressure and velocity. In cases when the mean components are relevant respect to the fluctuating ones this analysis is exhausting. In other cases, a separate evaluation of the fluctuation effects in lining design is treated, by means of experimental evidences. The mean dynamic pressure at the bottom depends strongly on the impingement angle that assumes a relevant role in the design of floor protections. In plunge pools, that are confined upstream by the presence of the drop structure, the impingement angle is theoretically determined by mass balance and momentum conservation, resulting independent on the jet entrance angle at the plunge pool water surface. The theoretical results are compared with literature experimental evidences and numerical simulations. This highlights the capability of the proposed theoretical framework to correctly interpret the physical phenomena and to produce suitable engineering approaches...|$|R
40|$|Debris-flows {{are very}} {{destructive}} phenomena {{which can cause}} material damages and victims: many efforts are devoted by the scientific and technical communities to the modelling and the design of proper countermeasures. The mitigation of the debrisflow effects can be accomplished in three ways: non-structural countermeasures (hazard mapping, insurance policies, regulatory interventions), active structural countermeasures (drainage systems, reforestation), passive structural countermeasures (check-dams, flow-breakers, <b>stilling</b> <b>basins).</b> The passive structural countermeasures consist of proper devices able to intercept the destructive flow, subdividing it {{into a number of}} minor flows, thus causing the formation of horizontal- and vertical-axis eddies like the hydraulic jump and, finally, reducing the debris-flow energy. Their design can be accomplished through the determination of the number, shape and size of the flow-breakers, check-dams and <b>stilling</b> <b>basins,</b> which are optimal to cause the loss of energy, and finally the debris-flow to stop; moreover, the design must fulfill the proper structural requirements, because of the loads exerted by the debris-flow on the cited devices. At present, there are not available general design criteria for these passive countermeasures, and physical and mathematical modelling are applied case by case. In this paper a type of check-dam is considered, consisting of a number of square shaped vertical elements, made of concrete or metal. It is shown that the repeated use of a mathematical model of debris-flow, where the momentum and mass conservation equations are discretized through the Finite Volume Method, can supply non-dimensional relations between the relevant design parameters (debris-flow energy losses and total loads exerted on the structures, number and size of the vertical elements) and the dynamical characteristics of the flow (discharge, velocity, height, bed slope). These relations can lead to a better interpretation of the physical model experiments, with decreasing in their implementation costs and, if judicious caution is used, to useful design formulas...|$|R
40|$|Some {{cases of}} damage {{experienced}} on chute and spillway <b>stilling</b> <b>basins</b> operating under flood conditions {{have shown the}} importance to understanding the hydrodynamic force involved {{in the design of}} the lining. The computations of the slab uplift force, starting from the pressure field acting on the bottom, require the knowledge of the spatial covariance function of the fluctuating pressures in hydraulic jump region. This needs the simultaneous acquisition of pressure data in a large number of mesh points in the slab area. From an experimental point of view, this simultaneous acquisition at a large number of probes can be prohibitive because it is too expensive in terms of time consumption and laboratory setup. To overcome these problems one can invoke the Taylor hypothesis that allows defining the spatial correlation via autocorrelation at a single point, by assuming a proper value of the propagation celerity of the fluctuating pressure. The objective of this paper is to explore the validity of the Taylor hypothesis and provide a criterion to define this celerity. This is performed via an experimental analysis, for several Froude numbers of the hydraulic jump incident flow. For all test series, the pressure spatial correlation related to several pivot points was obtained. By comparison with autocorrelation in time-resolved single-point measurements at the pivot, the pressure celerity value on the slab surface was obtained. At constant Froude number, a relationship able to define this celerity in space is pointed out. The spatial covariance of pressure fluctuations, as calculated by the proposed approach, shows a good agreement with measurements and verifies the validity of the Taylor hypothesis. As a consequence the possibility is highlighted to use single point pressure measurements in order to estimate the force acting on a slab in spillway <b>stilling</b> <b>basins...</b>|$|R
