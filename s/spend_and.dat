5|$|More people {{joined the}} middle class in the 1950s, with more money to <b>spend,</b> <b>and</b> the {{availability}} of consumer goods expanded along with the economy, including the automobile. Americans were spending more time in their automobiles and viewing them {{as an extension of}} their identity, which helped to fuel a boom in automobile sales. Most businesses directly or indirectly related to the auto industry saw tremendous growth during the decade. New designs and innovations appealed to a generation tuned into fashion and glamour, and the new-found freedom and way of life in the suburbs had several unforeseen consequences for the inner cities. The 1950s saw the beginning of white flight and urban sprawl, driven by increasing automobile ownership. Many local and national transportation laws encouraged suburbanization, which in time ended up damaging the cities economically.|$|E

A 'countercyclical' fiscal policy refers to the opposite approach: reducing <b>spending</b> <b>and</b> raising taxes during a boom period, and increasing spending/cutting taxes during a recession.|$|R

25|$|The key {{features}} of the 2011 CBA included changes related to health and safety, including {{a reduction in the}} number of off-season practices, a prohibition against training camp “two-a days", and a limit on contact practices in both the preseason and regular season. The new CBA also featured increases in player benefits, including retroactive pension increases for retired players and the creation of a neuro-cognitive benefit for players affected by concussions and other similar injuries. Also, the agreement promised an increase up to $1.5 million in salary guarantees for injured players and a new revenue split, offering players between 47 percent and 48.5 percent of all revenue. Changes were also made in contract-related benefits, with an increase in minimum player salaries and salary cap minimums, including the guarantee of a 99% -95% league wide <b>spend</b> <b>and</b> a requirement that each club would have to spend an average of 89% of the salary cap over four-year periods.|$|E
25|$|In late 2008, Krugman {{published}} a substantial updating {{of an earlier}} work, entitled The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008. In the book, he discusses {{the failure of the}} United States regulatory system to keep pace with a financial system increasingly out-of-control, and the causes of and possible ways to contain the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s. In 2012, Krugman published End This Depression Now!, a book which argues that looking at the available historical economic data, fiscal cuts and austerity measures only deprive the economy of valuable funds that can circulate and further add to a poor economy – people cannot <b>spend,</b> <b>and</b> markets cannot thrive if there is not enough consumption and there cannot be sufficient consumption if there is large unemployment. He argues that while it is necessary to cut debt, it is the worst time to do so in an economy that has just suffered the most severe of financial shocks, and must be done instead when an economy is near full-employment when the private sector can withstand the burden of decreased government spending and austerity. Failure to stimulate the economy either by public or private sectors will only unnecessarily lengthen the current economic depression and make it worse.|$|E

This {{is the right thing}} to do and we are going to do it...the same way families do; the same way some governments do and all businesses do. [...] We are going to adjust our spending to what we believe is the available and in this case the fair amount of revenue. [...] I know often with good reason there has been an opportunity in higher education to adjust tuition to match what the place wanted to <b>spend,</b> <b>and</b> I just think we've reached the point where we ought to break that pattern." [...] The first tuition freeze required the university to find $40 million in savings or new revenue. In order to make up for the lost revenue from tuition freezes, Daniels and the Purdue Board of Trustees focused on finding operating efficiencies such as consolidating information technology data centers, investing cash reserves and switching to a consumer-driven health plan for employees.|$|E

Gamasutra estimated that, in October 2009 and February 2010, 50 percent of Nintendo DS unit sales were DSi consoles.

[...] "If I take another term, I will be in the White House till 1933… Ten years in Washington is longer than any other man has had it—too long!" [...] In his memoirs, Coolidge explained his decision not to run: [...] "The Presidential office takes a heavy toll of those who occupy it and those who are dear to them. While we should not refuse to <b>spend</b> <b>and</b> be spent in the service of our country, it is hazardous to attempt what we feel is beyond our strength to accomplish." [...] After leaving office, he and Grace returned to Northampton, where he wrote his memoirs. The Republicans retained the White House in 1928 in the person of Coolidge's Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover. Coolidge had been reluctant to endorse Hoover as his successor; on one occasion he remarked that [...] "for six years that man has given me unsolicited advice—all of it bad." [...] Even so, Coolidge had no desire to split the party by publicly opposing the nomination of the popular commerce secretary.|$|E
