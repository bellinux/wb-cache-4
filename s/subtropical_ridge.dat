5|$|Most {{tropical}} cyclones form on {{the side}} of the <b>subtropical</b> <b>ridge</b> closer to the equator, then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving north and northeast into the main belt of the Westerlies.

Areas west of Japan and Korea tend to experience many fewer September–November tropical cyclone impacts during El Niño and neutral years. During El Niño years, the break in the <b>subtropical</b> <b>ridge</b> tends to lie near 130°E, which would favor the Japanese archipelago. During La Niña years, the formation of tropical cyclones, and the <b>subtropical</b> <b>ridge</b> position, shift westward across the western Pacific Ocean, which increases the landfall threat to China and greater intensity to Philippines. Those that form near the Marshall Islands find their way to Jeju Island, Korea.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{persistent}} winds {{from west}} to east on the poleward sides of the <b>subtropical</b> <b>ridges</b> located in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, ocean currents are driven {{in a similar manner}} in both hemispheres. The currents in the Northern Hemisphere are weaker than those in the Southern Hemisphere due to the differences in strength between the westerlies of each hemisphere. The process of western intensification causes currents on the western boundary of an ocean basin to be stronger than those on the eastern boundary of an ocean. [...] These western ocean currents transport warm, tropical water polewards toward the polar regions. [...] Ships crossing both oceans have taken advantage of the ocean currents for centuries.|$|R
500|$|Because of {{conservation}} of potential vorticity {{caused by the}} northward-moving winds on the <b>subtropical</b> <b>ridge's</b> western periphery and the increased relative vorticity of northward moving water, transport is balanced by a narrow, accelerating poleward current, which flows along the western boundary of the ocean basin, outweighing the effects of friction with the western boundary current known as the Labrador current. [...] The conservation of potential vorticity also causes bends along the Gulf Stream, which occasionally break off due to {{a shift in the}} Gulf Stream's position, forming separate warm and cold eddies.

50|$|During November 3, {{an area of}} low {{pressure}} developed over the Bay of Bengal, under the influence of active northeast monsoon conditions. On November 5, the IMD identified the system as a depression and designated it with the identifier 'BOB 04'. This was followed by the JTWC issuing a TCFA and subsequently initiating advisories on the system. The JTWC designated it '05B' and was reporting 35 kn winds around the center on November 6. Later that day, the IMD upgraded BOB 04 into a Deep Depression. The system drifted northwards {{over the next couple of}} days, maintaining its intensity. Located between two <b>subtropical</b> <b>ridges,</b> BOB 04 mostly showed quasi-stationary motion. However, albeit the adequately favorable conditions for further intensification, BOB 04 failed to intensify further.

50|$|Talas, {{being located}} in a very weak {{steering}} environment hardly moved in 24 hours and was effectively trapped between strong <b>subtropical</b> <b>ridges</b> and an anticyclone. Talas failed to strengthen {{for a very long}} time and remained loosely organized with all the convection located in the periphery. Early on August 28, Talas started to strengthen after a whole day in dry winds. The low-level circulation center started to get consolidated with deep convective bands wrapping into it. Talas was expected to make landfall over central Japan with strong winds. Talas then moved into an environment favorable for slow development, with moist winds and significantly warm sea surface temperatures. The center became well organized with convective bands tightly wrapped into it. Wind shear decreased and the center was wrapped with more tightly curved banding. The JTWC reported that there was more confidence in the strength and position of the system. They JTWC reported that they were expecting a peak intensity of 90 kn.|$|R

5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Edouard quickly strengthened {{due to the}} establishment of an upper-level anticyclone over the storm. The storm moved to the west in response to a strong <b>subtropical</b> <b>ridge</b> to its north, and Edouard strengthened into a hurricane on August 23. Due to very favorable conditions, the hurricane rapidly strengthened on August 24 and August 25 to peak as a 145mph (230km/h) Category4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Scale. A weakness in the <b>subtropical</b> <b>ridge</b> allowed for a motion more to the west-northwest, and the hurricane passed about 250mi (400km) north of the Lesser Antilles on August 28. For three days during this time, Edouard maintained Category4 intensity, though weakened late on August 28 due to an eyewall replacement cycle and vertical shear.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 21, {{the motion}} {{shifted to the}} north as it moved along the {{northwest}} periphery of the <b>subtropical</b> <b>ridge.</b> That general motion continued throughout the day, however, Helene began to turn more northeastward that evening {{along the edge of}} the <b>subtropical</b> <b>ridge,</b> east of Bermuda. A decrease in wind shear and relatively warm water around 81°F (27°C) kept the intensity mostly stationary, keeping Helene as a Category1 hurricane. The intensity held around 80mph (130km/h) before strengthening slightly late on September 22, despite losing some tropical characteristics (it was operationally downgraded to a tropical storm for a brief period) as it accelerated northeast in the north Atlantic. A QuikSCAT analysis early on September 23 confirmed a high-end Category1 hurricane with 90mph (145km/h) winds.|$|E
5|$|When a {{tropical}} cyclone crosses the <b>subtropical</b> <b>ridge</b> axis, normally through {{a break in}} the high-pressure area caused by a system traversing the Westerlies, its general track around the high-pressure area is deflected significantly by winds moving towards the general low-pressure area to its north. When the cyclone track becomes strongly poleward with an easterly component, the cyclone has begun recurvature, entering the Westerlies. A typhoon moving through the Pacific Ocean towards Asia, for example, will recurve offshore of Japan to the north, and then to the northeast, if the typhoon encounters southwesterly winds (blowing northeastward) around a low-pressure system passing over China or Siberia. Many tropical cyclones are eventually forced toward the northeast by extratropical cyclones in this manner, which move from west to east {{to the north of the}} <b>subtropical</b> <b>ridge.</b> An example of {{a tropical}} cyclone in recurvature was Typhoon Ioke in 2006, which took a similar trajectory.|$|E

50|$|Noru {{struggled}} to intensify significantly {{for two days}} owing to relatively low ocean heat content values and its asymmetric structure, until it was upgraded to a severe tropical storm at around 00:00 UTC on July 23. Subsequently, Noru slowed down and remained stationary, due to a complex steering environment consisting of ridging on three sides. The steering flow also transitioned from a <b>subtropical</b> <b>ridging</b> to the west to a near equatorial ridge {{to the south of}} the system. Noru rapidly intensified into the first typhoon of 2017 around 12:00 UTC, featuring a 20 km (12 mi) diameter pinhole eye embedded in an extremely compact core located about 900 km (560 mi) east of the Bonin Islands, thanks to moderate eastward outflow, anomalously warm SSTs and low vertical wind shear. After that, the eye repeatedly reappeared and filled due to increasing vertical wind shear offset by improving poleward outflow into the upper-low associated with Tropical Storm Kulap. Noru also started to track east-southeastward under the steering influence of a near equatorial ridge to the south.|$|R
5|$|With the <b>subtropical</b> <b>ridge</b> to its north, Isa tracked to {{the north}} and {{gradually}} curved to the west. It slowly intensified, due to it being a large tropical cyclone, and late on April 13 JTWC upgraded the storm to typhoon status; at the same time, JMA continued to assess Isa as a minimal tropical storm, and did not upgrade it to a typhoon until April 16. Isa maintained a nearly due-westward movement, although tropical cyclone prediction models anticipated a quick turn {{to the north}}. The JTWC recognized the northward model bias, which was described as under-analyzing the strength of the <b>subtropical</b> <b>ridge.</b> By April 16, the typhoon attained the equivalence of a Category3 tropical cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and despite a potential threat to Guam the typhoon remained 260km (160mi) south of the island.

At this point, Isa became an annular typhoon, with a large eye and a lack of spiralform rainbands, while moving nearly due northward, through a weakness in the <b>subtropical</b> <b>ridge.</b> Simultaneously, JMA assessed the typhoon as attaining peak 10-min winds of 155km/h (100mph).|$|E

5|$|Danielle {{levelled}} off {{somewhat in}} intensity after that round of rapid intensification, only gradually strengthening afterward due to structural {{changes in the}} storm related to the small wind field relative {{to the size of}} the eye.

Beginning late on August 15, at about 35°W, Danielle began to recurve to the northwest and eventually north while continuing to gradually strengthen. Early on August 16, the recurvature became more pronounced, and Danielle turned abruptly northward in the central Atlantic Ocean as an upper-level trough opened up a large break in the ridge. That movement took it along the eastern side of the <b>subtropical</b> <b>ridge,</b> preventing Danielle from moving any farther west and becoming any threat to North America or the Caribbean.

40|$|The midlatitude zonal {{westerlies}} {{continued to}} be stronger than normal during June, {{as they have for}} most of the year so far. As during the previous month (Dickson 1972), the 700 -mb flow was not strong over the United States, but was anomalously strong over the oceans, where deep Aleutian and Icelandic Lows were observed with stronger than normal midocean ridges (figs. 1, 2). The gradient over the north Atlantic was especially remarkable, as 700 -mb heights mere 118 m above normal east of Newfoundland but 115 m below normal between Scotland and Iceland. The peak 700 -mb mean wind speed was 19 m/s, which is 12 m/s above normal at that location just southeast of the tip of Greenland (fig. 4).

50|$|At {{the start}} of October 2016, a broad area of {{atmospheric}} convection persisted, to the east-southeast of Anderson Air Force Base on Guam. The system was located within a favourable environment for further development, with low vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures.

It was subsequently classified as a tropical depression during October 4, by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), while it was located about 1000 km to the northeast of Manila in the Philippines, to the east to the Babuyan Group of Islands. Later that day, PAGASA had named the system Julian. The JTWC started issuing advisories on the system while it moved westward during October 5, with the designation of 22W. Despite Julian having a disorganised structure while crossing the Luzon Strait, the system was located in an area of light to moderate wind shear and very warm sea surface temperatures. After satellite imagery had depicted a significant increase of convection, all agencies upgraded Julian to a tropical storm, with the JMA naming it as Aere.
