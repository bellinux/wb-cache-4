40|$|The trans-histone {{regulatory}} {{cross talk}} between H 2 BK 123 ubiquitination (H 2 Bub 1) and H 3 K 4 and H 3 K 79 methylation {{is not fully}} understood. In this study, we report that the residues arginine 119 and threonine 122 in the H 2 B C-terminal helix are important for transcription and cell growth and play a direct role in controlling H 2 Bub 1 and H 3 K 4 methylation. These residues modulate H 2 Bub 1 levels by controlling the chromatin binding and activities of the deubiquitinases. Furthermore, we find an uncoupling of the H 2 Bub 1 -mediated coregulation of both H 3 K 4 and -K 79 methylation, as these H 2 B C-terminal helix residues {{are part of a}} distinct surface that affects only Set 1 -COMPASS (complex proteins associated with Set 1) -mediated H 3 K 4 methylation without affecting the functions of Dot 1. Importantly, we also find that these residues interact with Spp 1 and control the chromatin association, integrity, and overall <b>stability</b> <b>of</b> <b>Set</b> 1 -COMPASS independent of H 2 Bub 1. Therefore, we have uncovered a novel role for the H 2 B C-terminal helix in the trans-histone cross talk as a binding surface for Set 1 -COMPASS. We provide further insight into the trans-histone cross talk and propose that H 2 Bub 1 stabilizes the nucleosome by preventing H 2 A-H 2 B eviction and, thereby, retains the “docking site” for Set 1 -COMPASS on chromatin to maintain its stable chromatin association, complex stability, and processive methylation...|$|E
