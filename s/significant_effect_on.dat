Increased meat weight and size was accompanied by a 15% reduction in intra-muscular fat and 25% reduction in total fat weight. No other significant effects were observed. A second backcross study conducted in Japan of Limousin and Japanese Black breeds identified similar changes to meat and fat quantities in cattle homozygous for the F94L mutation.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this research was}} {{to examine the effects of}} the big-five personality traits and organizational commitments on organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). The research method of this study was a mixed method combining quantitative and qualitative methods. For the quantitative research method, data were collected from 144 support staff at Ubon Ratchathani Rajabhat University, Thailand and the hypotheses were tested using the stepwise multiple regression analysis technique. For the qualitative research method, in-depth interviews with 11 support staff were used to explain the quantitative findings. The findings revealed that the components of the big-five personality traits and organizational commitments which significantly affected OCB were agreeable personality, continuance commitment, conscientious personality, affective commitment, and emotionally-stable personality. In examining intensively each dimension of the OCB as a dependent variable, the results showed the following: 1) agreeable personality, affective commitment, conscientious personality, and normative commitment had positive <b>significant</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> altruistic behavior; 2) conscientious personality, agreeable personality, and continuance commitment had positive <b>significant</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> conscientious behavior; 3) affective commitment and agreeable personality had positive <b>significant</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> sportsmanship behavior; 4) emotionally stable personality and continuance commitment had positive <b>significant</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> courteous behavior; and 5) continuance commitment, agreeable personality, conscientious personality, and emotionally-stable personality had positive <b>significant</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> civic virtue behavior...|$|R

5|$|An {{experimental}} vaccine {{was found}} to clear the amyloid plaques in early human trials, {{but it did not}} have any <b>significant</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> dementia. Researchers have been led to suspect non-plaque Aβ oligomers (aggregates of many monomers) as the primary pathogenic form of Aβ. These toxic oligomers, also referred to as amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), bind to a surface receptor on neurons and change the structure of the synapse, thereby disrupting neuronal communication. One receptor for Aβ oligomers may be the prion protein, the same protein that has been linked to mad cow disease and the related human condition, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, thus potentially linking the underlying mechanism of these neurodegenerative disorders with that of Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

Lessons itself was reprinted for over a century. However, because of the disrepute that educational writings fell into, largely due to the low esteem awarded Barbauld, Trimmer, and others by contemporary male Romantic writers, Barbauld's Lessons has rarely been studied by scholars. In fact, it has only been analysed in depth since the 1990s.|$|E
