500|$|On 2 July 1941, Galland led JG 26 {{into combat}} against a {{formation}} of No. 226 Squadron Blenheim bombers. Galland's fighter {{was hit by}} a 20 mm round from one of the bombers escort fighters. The armour plate fitted to the Bf 109 just days earlier saved Galland's life. Wounded in the head he managed to land and was again hospitalised {{for the second time in}} a few days. Just earlier that week, when the armour plate was installed, he severely berated his mechanic, Gerhard Meyer, who welded it in, when he hit his head on the canopy upon entering his aircraft. That same mechanic received [...] "a grateful <b>slap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back". Galland had been shot up and shot down twice in the space of four days. The Blenheim brought his tally to 70.|$|E
500|$|After his {{retirement}} from an mechanical failure, Bräck stated it affected his championship chances slightly and {{his retirement}} {{from the race}} was [...] "something that you don't want to have happen but unfortunately it happens sometimes and today {{it was one of}} those days." [...] Three days after the race, Tracy and Takagi was penalized by CART chief stewart Chris Kneifel for [...] "unjustifiable risk" [...] and for causing several caution periods by contact with other competitors. Tracy had two championship points deducted and was placed on probation for the next three road or street course races, while Takagi also had two points taken off his total and was given a probation period of three events. Kneifel said why the penalties were issued: We did not want to simply issue probations without accompanying them with a strong signal that actions like this will not be tolerated. Championship points are very hard-earned, and they're more valuable than money. We want our response to send out the very strong message that this isn't a <b>slap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wrist, or a token punishment.|$|E
500|$|When {{they come}} outside, Mark {{and the others}} welcome them warmly. [...] Leslie enjoys herself at the party and, when the beer runs out and the party is about to end, she keeps it going by {{retrieving}} the wine and cheese from the gift basket. [...] The next morning, she feels guilty and, despite her boss Ron's (Nick Offerman) assurance that [...] "t's {{not that big a}} deal," [...] Leslie issues a public apology to every government official in Pawnee, including a link to the new pit website. [...] Later, however, she learns April has placed a drunken video of herself drinking the rest of the wine on the site, even though she is only 19. [...] Ron tells Leslie an ethics board has called for a disciplinary hearing with Leslie. [...] Leslie apologizes to the board and defends April, accepting responsibility for the video. [...] As the questions from the board continue, Ron angrily defends Leslie, insisting, [...] "Leslie has never broken a rule in her life, to the point that it's annoying." [...] He abruptly ends the meeting and insists they will have to go through him to give Leslie anything more than a <b>slap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wrist.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of the video, critics commented on the {{resemblance}} between Rihanna's ex-boyfriend Chris Brown and her fictional love interest in the video, Dudley O'Shaughnessy, and how the video's content appeared to be somewhat of a reenactment of the assault upon Rihanna by Brown on the evening of the 2009 Grammy Awards. Chris Doplan of Consequence of Sound said that O'Shaughnessy strongly resembled Brown in his appearance. Amanda Dobbins of New York magazine concurred with Doplan, and wrote that O'Shaughnessy has short blond hair like Brown once had. Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine also thought that O'Shaughnessy's character is a depiction of Brown, especially in relation to the scene which features the couple in a car, with O'Shaughnessy driving recklessly and Rihanna begging him to stop. William Goodman of Spin provided an analysis of the video with regard to the Brown comparisons. Like many reviewers, he noted the resemblance between Brown and O'Shaughnessy, writing [...] "The clip stars a dead ringer for Brown, complete with dyed hair and bulging biceps". Goodman commented upon the video's opening narration, which was actually voiced by Agyness Deyn, [...] "The video opens with a Rihanna voice-over that warns, 'You almost feel ashamed that someone could be that important. No one will ever understand how much it hurts... you almost wish that you could have all that bad stuff back, so that you have the good." [...] In conclusion, Goodman commented that [...] the scene showing an altercation in a car is reminiscent of Brown's assault on Rihanna, which occurred inside a car. Goodman wrote: [...] "during a heated argument between the couple in a muscle car, the Brown look-alike gives the Barbadian beauty a <b>slap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> face. Convinced yet?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite these criticisms, however, both Francesa and Russo {{balked at}} the idea that Imus should be [...] fired as host of his nationally {{syndicated}} radio program Imus in the Morning. They disagreed, too, that the then proposed two-week suspension was merely, as one journalist had characterized it, [...] "a <b>slap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wrist." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first major}} tour was by an English {{team led by}} Graham Gooch in March 1982. Twelve cricketers, 11 of them with Test caps, had agreed in secret to make a one-month tour of the republic. The news only broke when they arrived in Johannesburg. The players {{expected}} a brief public outcry and ICC <b>slap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wrist. Instead they were the subject of global outrage among press and politicians, and labelled [...] "the Dirty Dozen" [...] in the Houses of Parliament.|$|E

2500|$|... (In {{romance and}} courting: santóng paspasan {{literally}} means 'holy speeding' {{and is a}} euphemism for sexual intercourse. It refers to the two styles of courting by Filipino boys: one is the traditional, protracted, restrained manner favoured by older generations, which often featured serenades and manual labour for the girl's parents; the other is upfront seduction, which {{may lead to a}} <b>slap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> face or a pregnancy out of wedlock. The second conclusion is known as pikot or what Western cultures would call a 'shotgun marriage'. This proverb is also applied in terms of diplomacy and negotiation.) ...|$|E

One day, his teacher {{arranged}} {{a meeting between}} Sivaya Subramuniyaswami and his long-awaited satguru, Sage Yogaswami. After a deep and inner meeting, Yogaswami gave him the name Subramuniya, an epithet of Sri Murugan. Subra means [...] "the light than emanates out from the central source." [...] Muni means a silent teacher, and ya means restraint. Subramuniya means a self-restrained soul who remains silent or speaks out from intuition. After a few visits, Jnanaguru Yogaswami initiated Subramuniya into sannyasa and ordained him into his lineage with a <b>slap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back giving the following instructions: ...|$|E
2500|$|As of 2006, {{there were}} 7700 police {{officers}} in Finland. [...] That police force was shown to be more law-abiding than firemen. However, it was revealed {{there are a few}} dozen cases each year in which police officers are convicted of crimes committed while on duty, 5 to 10 percent of the hundreds of such crimes prosecuted annually – the number of such crimes being shown to increase yearly. Police officers are most often suspected of traffic related crimes (endangering road safety, vehicular collisions etc.) which constitute approximately 50% of all cases. These types of cases were also the most likely to be dismissed before proceeding to the prosecutor for consideration. Second most numerous category is the use of force, approximately 20%, which proceed to the prosecutor without a fail apart from few off-duty petty assaults. In Finland, a petty assault could mean a <b>slap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cheek.|$|E

2500|$|Gould was {{averse to}} cold and wore heavy {{clothing}} (including gloves), even in warm places. He was once arrested, presumably {{mistaken for a}} vagrant, while sitting {{on a park bench}} in Sarasota, Florida, dressed in his standard all-climate attire of coat(s), hat and mittens. He also disliked social functions. He hated being touched, and in later life he limited personal contact, relying on the telephone and letters for communication. On one visit to Steinway Hall in New York City in 1959, the chief piano technician at the time, William Hupfer, greeted Gould by giving him a <b>slap</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back. Gould was shocked by this, and complained of aching, lack of coordination, and fatigue because of the incident. He went on to explore the possibility of litigation against Steinway & Sons if his apparent injuries were permanent. He was known for cancelling performances at the last minute, which is why Bernstein's above-mentioned public disclaimer opens with, [...] "Don't be frightened, Mr. Gould is here... will appear in a moment." ...|$|E
