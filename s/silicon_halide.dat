40|$|This {{literature}} survey {{is associated with}} the highly useful compound NHC supported halosilylenes. Silylenes are the silicon analogues of singlet carbenes, are highly reactive compounds with dicoordinate divalent silicon atoms. They are the silicon counterparts to carbenes and plays a very important role in silicon chemistry. Parent silylene and its derivatives R 2 Si: with small organic groups R represent reactive intermediates (generally formed in-situ), which have been investigated in the gas-phase, in diluted solutions, and in frozen rare-gas matrices at low temperatures. Prior to 1994, silylenes existed only as reactive intermediates (generally formed in-situ), isolable only in low-temperature matrixes. The field of stable silylene research has grown dramatically since the first isolation of a stable N-heterocyclic silylene by West et al. in 1994. Since then, several stable halosilylenes have been synthesized, some in fact showing remarkable thermal stability. NHC has a carbon centre with a lone pair of electrons. Carbon donates its lone pair of electron and binds strongly with silicon in low oxidation state making it stable enough to be isolated. The bond formed is yet facile enough to break for the use of monomeric SiX 2 under specific reaction conditions. They are isolated in varying crystalline form with different thermal stabilities depending on the NHC and <b>silicon</b> <b>halide</b> used. My work highlights the synthesis of such NHC supported halosily lenes, their reactions to make several silicon analogues of carbon compounds, Si-Si multiple bond, Si-E (E = main group element, transition metal) bonds, etc., and their characterization using 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, 29 Si NMR and molecular & electronic structural analysis using X-ray and computational methods as DFT Turbomole at BP/TZVP...|$|E

The feasibility of the basic process to make and collect silicon was demonstrated. The jet impaction/separation process was demonstrated to be a purification process. The rate at which gas phase species from silicon particle precursors, the time required for silane decomposition to produce particles, and the competing rate of growth of silicon seed particles injected into a decomposing silane environment were determined.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using continuous high-temperature reactions of alkali metals and <b>silicon</b> <b>halides</b> to produce <b>silicon</b> {{in large quantities}} and of suitable purity {{for use in the}} production of photovoltaic solar cells was demonstrated.

Further experiments at higher reagent flow rates were performed in a low temperature flow tube configuration with co-axial injection of reagents and relatively pure silicon was produced. A high temperature graphite flow tube was built and continuous separation of Si from NaCl was demonstrated. A larger scaled well stirred reactor was built. Experiments were performed to investigate the compatability of graphite based reactor materials of construction with sodium. At 1100 to 1200 K none of these materials were found to be suitable.

40|$|Nitrogen {{physisorption}} {{measurements of}} silicon nitride materials obtained from silicon diimide show the valuable porosity of these compounds in the mesopore regime and very high specific surface areas up to 1000 m(2) g(- 1), suitable for catalytic applications. The pore {{size of the}} solids is effectively tailored by the variation of parameters {{in the manufacture of}} the diimide source. Si(NH) (2) is obtained by reacting <b>silicon</b> <b>halides</b> with gaseous ammonia in an organic solvent followed by sublimation of the by-products in an ammonia flow at elevated temperatures (773 - 1273 K). The nature of the solvent, halide source and precipitation temperature strongly affect the average pore size and specific surface area of the product. The pore size can be adjusted in a range from 5. 6 to 9. 1 nm, as derived from nitrogen physisorption isotherms. The elemental composition of the porous nitrides varies from Si 2 N 2 (NH) to Si 3 N 4 and depends on the temperature of the heat treatment. IR measurements indicate a high number of amino groups present on the inner surface of the solids, suitable for further functionalization. The materials are amorphous according to XRD powder patterns and show broad Si- 29 MAS NMR lines. The low sintering tendencies in vacuum, ammonia and under ammonothermal conditions are essential for development of the compounds as high temperature catalysts...|$|R
2500|$|Silicon and {{silicon carbide}} readily react with all four stable halogens, forming the colourless, {{reactive}} and volatile silicon tetrahalides. Silicon tetrafluoride {{may also be}} made by fluorinating the other <b>silicon</b> <b>halides,</b> and is produced by the attack of hydrofluoric acid on glass. Heating two different tetrahalides together also produce a random mixture of mixed halides, which may also be produced by halogen exchange reactions. The melting and boiling points of these species usually rise with increasing atomic weight, though there are many exceptions: for example, the melting and boiling points drop as one passes from SiFBr3 through SiFClBr2 to SiFCl2Br. The shift from the hypoelectronic elements in group 13 and earlier to the group 14 elements {{is illustrated by the}} change from an infinite ionic structure in aluminium fluoride to a lattice of simple covalent silicon tetrafluoride molecules, as dictated by the lower electronegativity of aluminium than silicon, the stoichiometry (the +4 oxidation state being too high for true ionicity), and the smaller size of the silicon atom compared to the aluminium atom. Silicon tetrachloride is manufactured on a huge scale as a precursor to the production of pure silicon, silicon dioxide, and some silicon esters. The silicon tetrahalides hydrolyse readily in water, unlike the carbon tetrahalides, again because of the larger size of the silicon atom rendering it more open to nucleophilic attack and the ability of the silicon atom to expand its octet which carbon lacks. The reaction of silicon fluoride with excess hydrofluoric acid produces the octahedral hexafluorosilicate anion [...]|$|R
40|$|Silicon carbide (SiC) is a {{superior}} material for electronic and optoelectronic devices functioning under harsh environment {{because of its}} excellent properties. Among multiple processes involved in the fabrication of silicon carbide-based devices, one important step is to deposit SiC films on substrates to acquire the desired functionality. Currently, halide chemical vapor deposition emerges as a potent technique for growing silicon carbide epitaxial layers with a high deposition rate {{in the range of}} 50 - 300 &# 956;m/hr. Experimental studies of the <b>silicon</b> carbide <b>halide</b> chemical vapor deposition process suggest that the temperature field, gas velocity field, gas-phase and surface chemistry in the reactor has profound influence on the deposition rate, the quality, and the properties of the as-deposited epitaxial films. In this dissertation, a comprehensive mathematical model is developed for <b>silicon</b> carbide <b>halide</b> chemical vapor deposition process including gas dynamics, heat and mass transfer, gas-phase and surface chemical reaction mechanism, and radiofrequency induction heating. The governing equation system of this model is discretized by finite volume method, and solved by iterative solver to predict the thermal and flow field, gas composition and film deposition rate. Two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations of the deposition process in a horizontal hot-wall reactor using silicon tetrachloride, propane, and hydrogen as precursors are performed over a wide range of operational parameters to quantify the effects of deposition temperature, precursor flow rate and reactor configuration. Special attention is directed to the etching of silicon carbide films by hydrogen chloride {{and its impact on the}} film deposition rate at different processing conditions. Simplified chemical reaction mechanism is obtained using two-dimensional study, which makes the threedimensional simulation feasible using available computing resource. Threedimensional simulation is performed to address issues such as the film uniformity and the effects of buoyancy flow and deposition pressure on the film growth. Modified reactor design and process parameters are examined for controlling the reactive gas flow in a reactor chamber and enhancing the deposition rate. Our simulation shows that the formation of hydrogen chloride and the associated etching effect can be reduced by employing a modified gas delivery system...|$|R
30|$|There {{are various}} methods to prepare silica nanoparticles. Adam et al. [20] {{synthesized}} spherical nanosilica from agricultural biomass as RH via the sol–gel method.

However, the sol–gel technique [19, 21 – 23] is the most common method for silica synthesis. It involves simultaneous hydrolysis and condensation reaction. In this process, a sol of sodium silicate or <b>silicon</b> alkoxide or <b>halide</b> gets converted into a polymeric network of gel. During silica synthesis by sol–gel process under certain conditions like restriction of gel growth, silica gets precipitated. In such preparation, the steps involved are coagulation and precipitation from silica solution. In the present investigation, we have focused our effort on preparing stable nanosilica from sodium silicate which was synthesized from Vietnamese rice husk using the sol–gel technique.|$|R

In this work a novel simulation tool is presented that treats the physics of a plasma process, from reactor scale down to atomistic scale, in one unified model. The simulator consists of a hierarchy of four modules that are linked together in a self-consistent way: A plasma bulk module, a plasma sheath module, a feature module, and a moleculardynamics module. The simulator is able to treat realistic process conditions, and is additionally computational very efficient. It is therefore suited as a TCAD tool for the microelectronic industry. As example, the reactive ion etching of <b>silicon</b> in an <b>halide</b> containing environment (fluorine, chlorine, and bromine, respectively) is investigated. The feed gas is additionally diluted with argon. The discharge is rf driven; the substrate, which typically sits {{on one of the}} electrodes, is in direct contact with the plasma.
