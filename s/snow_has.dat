5|$|There {{are four}} main {{mechanisms}} for movement of deposited snow: drifting of unsintered snow, avalanches of accumulated snow on steep slopes, snowmelt during thaw conditions, {{and the movement}} of glaciers after <b>snow</b> <b>has</b> persisted for multiple years and metamorphosed into glacier ice.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} cold-adapted and {{hibernate}}s in the winter. In Great Britain, {{males and females}} hibernate for about 150 and 180 days respectively. In northern Sweden hibernation lasts 8–9 months. On mild winter days, they may emerge to bask where the <b>snow</b> <b>has</b> melted and will often travel across snow. About 15% of adults and 30–40% of juveniles die during hibernation.|$|E

25|$|Snow at {{sea level}} is {{occasionally}} recorded on mainland Australia, but is more frequent in Tasmania where snowfalls {{at sea level}} can occur during the winter months. <b>Snow</b> <b>has</b> been recorded across most of Tasmania, though it is rare on the northern coast at sea level. Snow is rare in the southernmost capitals like Melbourne and Hobart, falling less than once every five years, {{and in the other}} capitals it is unknown (however <b>snow</b> <b>has</b> fallen in the hill suburbs of Perth and Adelaide). However, there are extensive, well-developed ski fields in the Great Dividing Range, a few hours' drive from Melbourne and Sydney. Light snow generally falls every winter in Canberra, however, and other cities that may receive regular seasonal snowfalls include Orange, Oberon, Lithgow and Katoomba in New South Wales.|$|E

25|$|Arctic regions notably release {{more heat}} back into space {{than what they}} absorb, {{effectively}} cooling the Earth. This has been a concern since arctic ice and <b>snow</b> <b>has</b> been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures, creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker (being water or ground which is darker color) and reflects less heat back into space. This feedback loop results in a reduced albedo effect.|$|E
25|$|Avalanche {{initiation}} {{can start}} {{at a point}} with {{only a small amount}} of snow moving initially; this is typical of wet snow avalanches or avalanches in dry unconsolidated snow. However, if the <b>snow</b> <b>has</b> sintered into a stiff slab overlying a weak layer then fractures can propagate very rapidly, so that a large volume of snow, that may be thousands of cubic meters, can start moving almost simultaneously.|$|E

25|$|While light snowfalls are {{not unusual}} on {{the peaks of}} the Porongurup and Stirling Range, it is very unusual for snow to fall to ground level {{anywhere}} in Western Australia. However, <b>snow</b> <b>has</b> been recorded in Mount Barker on several occasions. On 28 August 1992, with a maximum temperature of 7.2 degrees Celsius, two falls of snow were recorded. That same year, on 19 November, a light snowfall was recorded just two weeks before summer, this was {{the latest in the}} year snow had been recorded in the whole of Western Australia.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, snow falls {{frequently}} on the highlands near the east coast, {{in the states}} of Victoria, New South Wales and Tasmania and in the Australian Capital Territory. There is a regular snow season in several areas which have seasonal ski tourism industries. Snow also falls with some regularity on the Great Dividing Range {{as far north as}} Stanthorpe, Queensland and in isolated parts of South Australia and Western Australia, but outside these areas, snow is an extremely rare occurrence. <b>Snow</b> <b>has</b> also fallen on Uluru and near Alice Springs on at least one occasion.|$|E

King Tommen Baratheon, Joffrey's eight-year-old brother, now rules in King's Landing under his mother, Cersei Lannister. Brienne, the Maid of Tarth, is on a mission to find Sansa Stark, aided by Jaime Lannister.

25|$|Snowstorms and rainstorms are {{important}} contributors to avalanche danger. Heavy snowfall will cause {{instability in the}} existing snowpack, both because of the additional weight and because the new <b>snow</b> <b>has</b> insufficient time to bond to underlying snow layers. Rain has a similar effect. In the short-term, rain causes instability because, like a heavy snowfall, it imposes an additional load on the snowpack; and, once rainwater seeps down through the snow, it acts as a lubricant, reducing the natural friction between snow layers that holds the snowpack together. Most avalanches happen during or soon after a storm.|$|E
25|$|Light {{snowfall}} typically {{falls on}} nearby Mount Buninyong and Mount Warrenheip {{at least once}} a year but in the urban area only during heavy winters. Widespread frosts and fog are more common during the cooler months. <b>Snow</b> <b>has</b> been known to fall heavily. Heavy snow seasons occurred in 1900–1902 and 1905–1907 (with record falls in 1906), and moderate snow seasons were recorded during the 1940s and 1980s. Recent snowfalls to have occurred within the urban area were in 2006, 2008, 2014 and 2016, with falls in November 2006 (light, also the latest snowfall on record), July 2007 (heavy), June 2008 (light), August 2008 (light), August 2014 (moderate) and June 2016 (light).|$|E

25|$|The high Mediterranean {{mountains}} above 1700 metres presents {{some special}} characteristics. Winters are very harsh and long; {{the thickness of}} the snow and strong frosts prevent almost any type of biological activity. Once the <b>snow</b> <b>has</b> disappeared, the soil dries quickly due to the strong sun and high temperatures reached in summer. The period of time suitable for the growth of vegetation is therefore very short and for the above-mentioned reasons, the land is dry most of the time. Under such conditions, the forest enters a state of crisis, being replaced by piornales (ciste and broom formations) and thickets pluvinulares accompanied at lower levels by Scots pine, often isolated individuals twisted and deformed by the snow.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Madison, Wisconsin, instituted its Red Bikes Project, {{a public}} bike sharing program. These red-painted {{bicycles}} {{were available for}} the use of the general public, primarily in the student areas of State Street between the University of Wisconsin campus and the Wisconsin State Capitol. Initially, the only rule regarding the use of a Red Bikes Project bicycle was that it was required to remain outside and unlocked, and thus available for any passerby. After a surge in bicycle thefts and vandalism, the program was modified to require a valid credit card and $80 in security deposits for both the bicycle and the now-mandatory bicycle lock. The program is now only available seasonally, from spring (when all <b>snow</b> <b>has</b> melted) to 30 November.|$|E
25|$|The Southern Schneeferner is {{surrounded}} by the peaks of the Wetterspitzen and the Wetterwandeck. It is also a remnant of the once great Platt Glacier. Today, the Southern Schneeferner extends up {{as far as the}} arête and therefore has no protection from direct sunshine. It has also been divided into two basins by a ridge of rock that has appeared as the <b>snow</b> <b>has</b> receded. It is a matter of debate whether the Southern Schneeferner should still be classified as a glacier. The Southern Schneeferner also reached its last high point in 1979, when it covered an area of 31.7 hectares. This had shrunk by 2006 to just 8.4 hectares however. The highest point of the glacier lies at an elevation of 2,665 metres and the lowest at 2,520metres.|$|E
