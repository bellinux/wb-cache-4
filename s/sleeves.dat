5|$|In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting {{his players}} {{to be more}} {{distinctly}} dressed, updated the kit, adding white <b>sleeves</b> and changing the shade to a brighter pillar box red. Two possibilities have been suggested for {{the origin of the}} white <b>sleeves.</b> One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf.|$|E
5|$|New {{home and}} away kits were brought in {{for the first time}} in two years. The home kit {{included}} red shirts with a white collar and white trims on the <b>sleeves,</b> white shorts and red socks.

5|$|Regardless {{of which}} story is true, {{the red and}} white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn the {{combination}} ever since, aside from two seasons. The first was 1966–67, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts; this proved unpopular and the white <b>sleeves</b> returned the following season. The second was 2005–06, the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury, when the team wore commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their first season in the stadium; the club reverted to their normal colours {{at the start of}} the next season. In the 2008–09 season, Arsenal replaced the traditional all-white <b>sleeves</b> with red <b>sleeves</b> with a broad white stripe.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} examine on {{the effectiveness}} of tapered <b>sleeve</b> connector in providing confinement effect to embedded reinforcement bar. The objectives of the investigation are to study the bond mechanism of grouted <b>sleeve</b> connector and to study the effects of confinement provided by the grouted <b>sleeve</b> connector. Two different configurations (welded bar <b>sleeve</b> and tapered <b>sleeve)</b> of <b>sleeve</b> connector were used in this study. Various <b>sleeve</b> diameters were used in this research to study their effects on the bond mechanism. The bond failure progression inside the grouted <b>sleeve</b> connector was observed visually as halved welded steel bar connector and tapered head connector were used. The experimental works consisted two phases where phase I was the testing of plain grouted <b>sleeve.</b> Phase II involved the testing steel fibre reinforced grout <b>sleeve.</b> Steel fibres of 0 %, 0. 5 %, 0. 75 % and 1. 0 % were introduced to the connector in a way so the grout inside the connector will exhibit post-cracking behaviour. Pull-out tests were carried out and it was observed that the performance of tapered <b>sleeve</b> was better than welded bar <b>sleeve</b> due to higher confinement level. The provision of sufficient confinement stress able to delay the development of splitting cracks. The test result showed that welded bar <b>sleeve</b> was governed by splitting failure mode, whereas tapered <b>sleeve</b> failed in pull-out failure mode...|$|R

5|$|Arsenal's home colours {{have been}} the {{inspiration}} {{for at least three}} other clubs. In 1909, Sparta Prague adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time; in 1938, Hibernian adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt <b>sleeves</b> in their own green and white strip. In 1920, Sporting Clube de Braga's manager returned from a game at Highbury and changed his team's green kit to a duplicate of Arsenal's red with white <b>sleeves</b> and shorts, giving rise to the team's nickname of Os Arsenalistas. These teams still wear those designs to this day.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the performance of}} the proposed grouted <b>sleeve</b> connector with and without steel spiral as transverse reinforcement under incremental tensile load until failure. The connector utilized mild steel pipe as <b>sleeve</b> where the <b>sleeve</b> consists of external and internal <b>sleeve</b> with the diameter of the external <b>sleeve</b> is larger than internal <b>sleeve.</b> The mild steel pipe and the steel spiral are used to confine and reinforce the grout and the two discontinued bars spliced end-to-end configuration in the <b>sleeve.</b> The test shows that, there are two modes of failure which were bar slipped and bar fractured outside the <b>sleeve.</b> Eleven specimens out of fourteen shows satisfactory results as it failed due to bar fractured outside the <b>sleeve</b> and achieve satisfactory ultimate tensile capacity. The stiffness and the ductility of the connectors also satisfy. Grouted <b>sleeve</b> connectors with steel spiral perform better compared to connectors without a steel spiral. The test shows that {{the performance of the}} grouted <b>sleeve</b> connector with or without steel spiral was governed by grout-bar bond, anchorage length and confinement action provided by the <b>sleeve</b> and the steel spiral. The connectors have a potential to be used in connecting precast concrete structure...|$|R
30|$|Figure  7 {{also shows}} the stress arch is most obvious {{within a certain}} range from the <b>sleeve</b> end. Within the range, the soil plug {{undertakes}} the {{major part of the}} internal shaft resistance, and the stress value increases with the penetration depth. The simulation results accord with the study of Lobo-Guerrero and Vallejo (2007), the contact stress mainly was concentrated at the bottom of <b>sleeve</b> end, and was delivered to the interior of the <b>sleeve</b> in a short distance from the <b>sleeve</b> end. During <b>sleeve</b> jacking, the void ratio is slightly smaller than the void ratio in initial stress state due to the monotonic shear between the soils and <b>sleeve</b> wall. Compared to the <b>sleeve</b> jacking, the arching effect of vibratory <b>sleeve</b> driving is relatively weaker, since the cyclic shear between the soils and <b>sleeve</b> wall makes void ratio decrease to the minimum value (Henke and Grabe 2008). The soil plug is compacted under vibratory action, which makes the soils at the bottom of <b>sleeve</b> difficult to be squeezed into the <b>sleeve.</b> Consequently, the arching effect is relatively weaker.|$|R
5|$|Chapman also {{advocated}} {{the use of}} white footballs and numbered shirts, as well as adding hoops to Arsenal's socks {{to make it easier}} for players to pick each other out. He later made a further change to Arsenal's kit, adding white <b>sleeves</b> to the previously all-red shirt and brightening the colour, before a match against Liverpool on 4 March 1933; the same kit theme of red with white <b>sleeves</b> or trim survives to this day. The tradition of both teams walking out together at the FA Cup Final was started in 1930 due to Herbert Chapman's involvement with both clubs, and has continued since.|$|E

30|$|When the <b>sleeve</b> {{is being}} driven, the <b>sleeve</b> {{transfers}} the periodic vibrating load to the soils around the <b>sleeve</b> (Ekanayake et al. 2013). The strain in the soils around the <b>sleeve</b> continues to increase, and the cohesion and shear strength gradually decrease. Compared to the infinite soils outside the <b>sleeve,</b> the soil plug inside the <b>sleeve</b> undergoes stronger cyclic shear force {{transferred from the}} <b>sleeve</b> wall. Therefore, the fluctuation of the internal shaft resistance is more obvious {{than that of the}} external shaft resistance. As the result, the soil strength and cohesion decrease under cyclic shearing action. Because of the decrease in the soil strength and cohesion, the soil plug becomes partially-plugged, and the penetration resistance of <b>sleeve</b> is much smaller than those by other installation methods.|$|R
