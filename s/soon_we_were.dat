25|$|We {{would often}} cross the broad avenue with the martial {{sounding}} name... The one that separated Courbevoie from Puteaux. It {{was in the}} peaceful garden of that welcoming household {{only a few years}} before the terrible year of 1914 that forms were born that, 50 years later, one would still think were new! We returned there often and <b>soon</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> spending our Sunday afternoons not merely conversing about aesthetic novelties but rather kicking a ball around or indulging in a spot of archery.|$|E
2500|$|It {{says in the}} Akathist that St. Herman envisioned [...] "an Episcopal throne in this land." [...] (Ikos 11) It doesn't say {{anything}} about multiple thrones, but onean autocephalous Church in this landone {{that came to be}} in 1970 [...] [...] I look back on those seminary years and years later when there was much hope for a united church in America. [...] There were pan-Orthodox celebrations; Sunday of Orthodoxy gatherings were major events and the spirit of the faithful and clergy was elevated in this gathering of the Church. [...] Now we look back just ten years later and find the gathering of bishops at Ligonier is hailed as the greatest event of American Orthodoxy! [...] I wonder how the canonization of America's first saint is relegated to some lesser place in the life of Orthodoxy in America. [...] Even Ligonier was hopeful {{to those of us who}} were serving the churches in multiple jurisdictions. [...] <b>Soon</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> disappointed when hierarchs removed their names from the documents that were prepared; one on evangelism and the other on administrative unity.|$|E
60|$|The crowd obeyed, {{opening a}} path, and <b>soon</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> face to face.|$|E
6000|$|... "White girl be no fool. Indian friend; no hurt one hair of her head. <b>Soon</b> <b>we</b> <b>be</b> in {{camp and}} she will see what a friend Yellow Elk has been." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We are in {{for more}} trouble from the Wyandots and Shawnees. But, Bessie, I don't believe it will come <b>soon.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> too well {{protected}} here for anything but a protracted siege." ...|$|R
5000|$|Let’s {{just listen}} to the music of the morning,For <b>soon</b> <b>we</b> must <b>be</b> on our way."-October 1962 ...|$|R
60|$|The breeze {{served us}} admirably. We skimmed before {{it like a}} bird, {{the coast of the}} island {{flashing}} by and the view changing every minute. <b>Soon</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> past the high lands and bowling beside low, sandy country, sparsely dotted with dwarf pines, and <b>soon</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> beyond that again and had turned the corner of the rocky hill that ends the island on the north.|$|E
60|$|<b>Soon</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{running through}} a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither ship nor boat to be seen.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Harrison was {{introduced}} to the others, and <b>soon</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> seated, on the piazza, and I was relating my experiences.|$|E
60|$|So <b>soon</b> as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{clear of}} the crowd—‘Mr. Robbie?’ said I, bowing.|$|R
50|$|Our {{religion}} {{is all about}} forgiving {{but there is a}} limit. I have passed on the word to the Roman Catholic associations and the Parish Association also. Their representatives and 20 other pastors will <b>be</b> here <b>soon.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> also planning to take out a protest rally in the city to voice our concern.|$|R
60|$|TREHERNE. Man alive, {{you told}} me all about it <b>soon</b> after <b>we</b> <b>were</b> wrecked.|$|R
60|$|<b>Soon,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{once more}} afloat; by our side, Media sociably seated; {{six of his}} paddlers, perched upon the gunwale, swiftly urging us over the lagoon.|$|E
60|$|The girl they bound also, {{and then}} they {{fastened}} us together. In the meantime they had brought our craft alongside the disabled battleship, and <b>soon</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> transported to the latter's deck.|$|E
60|$|When Frank {{threw the}} saddle over Satan I {{interrupted}} {{him and said}} I would care for my horse henceforward. <b>Soon</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> under way, the horses fresh, the dogs scenting the keen, cold air.|$|E
60|$|The Major, as <b>soon</b> as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> alone, turned upon me his impassive countenance.|$|R
5000|$|... "This is {{the fate}} of our {{generation}} - that we stand between two eras. We never belonged to the period which ends today. Whether we will ever belong to the time to come, and if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> made to it by us could, whether it will come so <b>soon?</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> in the middle between them. In an empty room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Delay not, son, but get to thy saving work. An {{we bring}} not the water back again, and <b>soon,</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> ruined, {{and the good}} work of two hundred years must end. And see thou do it with enchantments that be holy, for the Church will not endure that work in her cause be done by devil's magic." ...|$|R
60|$|The next morning, {{before we}} had {{finished}} our breakfast, a messenger from the Agency came in {{to say that a}} carryall was at the door, and <b>soon</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> on our way toward the Fort.|$|E
60|$|<b>Soon</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> all smoking so hard, {{that the}} canopied howdah, under which we reclined, sent up purple wreaths like a Michigan wigwam. There {{we sat in}} a ring, all smoking in council--every pipe a halcyon pipe of peace.|$|E
60|$|<b>Soon,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> all strung {{along the}} main-topsail-yard; the ship rearing and {{plunging}} under us, like a runaway steed; each man gripping his reef-point, and sideways leaning, dragging the sail over toward Jackson, whose business {{it was to}} confine the reef corner to the yard.|$|E
5000|$|In a blog DeLeon posted after Cash {{decided to}} leave the band he said, [...] "Thank you again to {{everyone}} for your unending support, you've made the tour and this summer one we'll never forget. We hope to see everybody again <b>soon.</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> happier than ever and have so many songs <b>we</b> <b>are</b> dying to show you guys! Get ready... the best is yet to come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, anyhow, {{your son}} is sound and well--if sorrowful and angry. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> {{relieved}} that night. And there are rumours that very <b>soon</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to have a holiday and a refit. We lost rather heavily. <b>We</b> have <b>been</b> praised. But all along, Essex has done well. I can't reckon to get back yet, but there are such things as leave for eight-and-forty hours or so in England....|$|R
5000|$|... "How <b>Soon</b> <b>We</b> Forget" [...] <b>is</b> a 1987 single by Colonel Abrams, {{from his}} album You and Me Equals Us. The single was Abrams' last of four number one hits {{on the dance}} play charts. [...] "How <b>Soon</b> <b>We</b> Forget" [...] <b>was</b> also Abrams' most {{successful}} single on the soul charts, reaching number six.|$|R
60|$|I did {{not think}} much of her words at the time, but {{afterwards}} they came back to me. So we slipped away together, followed by the dog Koos, and <b>soon</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> running over the veldt with our faces set towards the country of the Zulu tribe.|$|E
60|$|I {{firmly believe}} the water {{came through the}} wood. First it began to ooze, then to trickle. It {{was like trying to}} carry moist sugar in a thin paper bag. <b>Soon</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> taking in water as though we had opened a door in her bottom.|$|E
60|$|<b>Soon</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{rattling}} {{over the}} stones in Piccadilly, wrapped in greatcoats, {{for the morning}} wind was cold. We saw the Earl of March and Ruglen getting out of a chair before his house, opposite the Green Park, and he stopped swearing at the chairmen to wave at us.|$|E
50|$|So <b>Soon</b> <b>We</b> Change <b>is</b> a 1979 album from Temptations singer, David Ruffin. It was {{his first}} album for Warner Bros. Records after years of being with Motown.|$|R
6000|$|THE {{news was}} all over town in two minutes, {{and you could see}} the people tearing down on the run from every which way, some of them putting on their coats as they come. Pretty <b>soon</b> <b>we</b> <b>was</b> {{in the middle of a}} crowd, and the noise of the {{tramping}} was like a soldier march. The windows and dooryards was full; and every minute somebody would say, over a fence: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{can this}} mean?" [...] she thought. [...] "How {{could they have}} missed us so <b>soon?</b> <b>We</b> <b>are</b> seldom out of our cabin before eight o'clock. I cannot {{comprehend}} it!" [...] And then a thought came to her which made her face grow pale. [...] "Is it possible," [...] she said to herself, [...] "that {{any of the others}} have come? I must go immediately and find out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did he?" [...] she {{answered}} indifferently, and I think we spoke no more {{until we were}} in Windyghoul. <b>Soon</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> barely conscious of each other's presence. Never since have I walked between the school- house and Thrums in so short a time, nor seen so little on the way.|$|E
60|$|Presently, all {{swollen with}} conceit, I went up-stairs and gave my {{prisoner}} his liberty. He gave me good-morning civilly; and I gave {{the same to}} him, smiling down upon him, from the heights of my sufficiency. <b>Soon</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> set to breakfast, {{as it might have}} been the day before.|$|E
60|$|<b>Soon</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{beyond the}} reach of Turkish missiles, though still within sound of the guns. Our pace showed that we were making what I suppose my {{military}} friends would style a forced march. Nicholas was evidently unwilling to converse on the object of our march, but at length gave way a little.|$|E
5000|$|... "Very <b>soon</b> <b>we</b> {{would both}} <b>be</b> {{completely}} twisted, {{but there was}} no going back." ...|$|R
60|$|Accordingly, next day, as <b>soon</b> as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> alone {{together}} I {{put the question}} to her, although not without a nervous qualm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Forward, Sir Hugh," [...] said Day {{a little}} nervously. [...] "This part of Venice has no good name, for many wicked deeds are done here, but <b>soon</b> <b>we</b> shall <b>be</b> through it." ...|$|R
