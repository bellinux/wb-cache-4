5|$|Greer Stadium {{was home}} to a rare {{baseball}} occurrence on August 6 and August 7, 1988, when Nashville and Indianapolis exchanged no-hitters on back-to-back nights. First, Indianapolis' Randy Johnson and Pat Pacillo combined for a no-hit loss against the Sounds, a 1–0Nashville win. That game was won by Nashville when Lenny Harris walked to first base, <b>stole</b> second base, <b>stole</b> third base, and then came home, scoring on a groundout. The next night, Nashville's Jack Armstrong pitched a no-hit game against the Indians, a 4–0Sounds victory. This {{was the first time}} in American Association history that teams played in back-to-back no-hit games, and was the third no-hitter in Sounds franchise history.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Henderson broke Lou Brock's {{major league}} single season record by {{stealing}} 130 bases, a total {{which has not}} been approached since.

Henderson's 130 steals outpaced nine of the American League's 14 teams that season. He also led the AL in walks (116), was 4th in runs (119) and 3rd in on base % (.398).|$|E
5|$|In {{another of}} her studies, Morgan worked with a fox breeder to {{study the effects of}} diets that {{contained}} low and normal amounts of B vitamins. The experimental group (the vitamin-restricted foxes) developed a fine, sparse gray coat that resembled the fashionable fur of the silver fox. Morgan found that the foxes with normal intake of B vitamins had shiny black fur. After the experiments, a fur <b>stole</b> was made out of fur from both the experimental and control groups. Morgan wore the <b>stole</b> on at least two important occasions – her presentation of the study data in 1939 and her Garvan Medal award ceremony ten years later.|$|E

The most valuable peltries come from eastern Canada which, although the smallest, are the silkiest and darkest.|$|R

5|$|Some species, {{including}} frigatebirds, gulls, and skuas, {{engage in}} kleptoparasitism, stealing food items from other birds. Kleptoparasitism {{is thought to}} be a supplement to food obtained by hunting, rather than a significant part of any species' diet; a study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds <b>stole</b> at most 40% of their food and on average <b>stole</b> only 5%. Other birds are scavengers; some of these, like vultures, are specialised carrion eaters, while others, like gulls, corvids, or other birds of prey, are opportunists.|$|E
