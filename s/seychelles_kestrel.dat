50|$|Recently {{the island}} {{has been created}} as a {{wildlife}} reserve. It {{is the home of}} the extremely rare Seychelles white-eye and other birds such as the <b>Seychelles</b> <b>kestrel,</b> Seychelles blue pigeon and the Madagascar turtle-dove. It also has two species of gecko.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Seychelles</b> <b>kestrel</b> (Falco araeus) {{is a small}} bird of prey {{belonging}} to the genus Falco in the falcon family, Falconidae. It is endemic to the Seychelles Islands where {{it is the only}} breeding bird of prey. It is known in Seychellois Creole as the katiti after its loud, shrill call.|$|E
50|$|The largest falcon is the {{gyrfalcon}} {{at up to}} 65 cm in length. The smallest falcons are the kestrels, {{of which}} the <b>Seychelles</b> <b>kestrel</b> measures just 25 cm. As with hawks and owls, falcons exhibit sexual dimorphism, with the females typically larger than the males, thus allowing {{a wider range of}} prey species.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} as an IBA by BirdLife International because it supports populations of <b>Seychelles</b> <b>kestrels,</b> <b>Seychelles</b> blue pigeons, Seychelles scops owls, Seychelles swiftlets, Seychelles bulbuls, Seychelles white-eyes and Seychelles sunbirds.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} {{identified}} as an IBA by BirdLife International because it supports populations of <b>Seychelles</b> <b>kestrels,</b> <b>Seychelles</b> blue pigeons, Seychelles swiftlets, Seychelles bulbuls and Seychelles sunbirds. Reptiles and amphibians found at the site include the Seychelle Islands tree frog, six caecilians, four geckos, two skinks and two snakes, {{all of which are}} endemic. Hawksbill turtles nest on the beaches and green turtles feed along the coast. Most of the Praslin population of the Seychelles fruit bat roosts in the IBA.|$|R
50|$|The Important Bird Area (IBA) {{comprises}} a {{tract of}} 20 ha of dense shrubland and rocky areas with caves and large boulders {{at an altitude}} of 250-458 m. The vegetation is dominated by exotic plants, principally Cinnamomum verum, Tabebuia pallida and Chrysobalanus icaco. Scattered trees include Sandoricum indicum, Falcataria moluccana (= Paraserianthes falcataria) and Pterocarpus indicus, with some endemics such as Phoenicophorium borsigianum, Deckenia nobilis and Paragenipa wrightii. It was exploited for cinnamon, timber and firewood until the late 20th century. The site has been identified as an IBA by BirdLife International because it supports populations of <b>Seychelles</b> <b>kestrels,</b> <b>Seychelles</b> blue pigeons, Seychelles swiftlets, Seychelles bulbuls and Seychelles sunbirds. The site also supports small numbers of Seychelles’ endemic reptiles and amphibians.|$|R
5000|$|The {{prominent}} avifauna, both endemic {{and global}} species, {{with the palm}} trees as their habitat, are: the Seychelles black parrot (Coracopsis barklyi) (called an [...] "enigmatic bird" [...] that feeds on {{the fruits of the}} palm trees and they are akin to the vasa parrots of Madagascar), Alectroenas pulcherrimus (Seychelles blue pigeon); Hypsipetes crassirostris (Seychelles bulbul); Nectarinia dussumieri (Seychelles sunbird); Collocalia francica (Mascarene swiftlet); and Falco araea (<b>Seychelles</b> <b>kestrel).</b>|$|E
50|$|Its closest {{relative}} is the <b>Seychelles</b> <b>kestrel,</b> F. araea. Their ancestors diverged {{probably less}} than one million years ago (roughly around the early Ionian)It is the smallest of all kestrels, otherwise similar to the Madagascar kestrel (and originally considered the same species). Its range is reduced to Mahé, with a few pairs on Silhouette Island, North Island and Praslin. Its diet is mainly lizards. The species' status, as the following one's, is Vulnerable according to the IUCN.|$|E
50|$|Flagship species include: the Seychelles magpie robin and the Seychelles warbler, {{have been}} spectacularly {{rescued from the}} brink of {{extinction}} by BirdLife International, Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts, Island Conservation Society, Nature Seychelles, private islands (Fregate and Denis) and the Government of Seychelles. These birds, once restricted to one island each, have been translocated to many others. The national bird is the rare Seychelles black parrot. Seychelles has 12 endemic bird species. These are the Aldabra drongo, Seychelles magpie robin, Seychelles paradise flycatcher, Seychelles fody, Seychelles scops-owl, Seychelles white-eye, Seychelles swiftlet, <b>Seychelles</b> <b>kestrel,</b> Seychelles blue pigeon, Seychelles bulbul, Seychelles warbler and Seychelles sunbird. In addition, the islands were formerly home to the Seychelles parakeet, a species that became extinct in the late 1800s.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{requirement for}} biologists conserving vulnerable species of wildlife and managing genetic {{problems associated with}} small population size is to evaluate existing evidence regarding what is known of a species’ recent population history. For endemic island species in particular, current genetic impoverishment {{could be due to}} either a recent population crash or a consequence of an evolutionary history of sustained isolation and small effective population size. Interpreting any given case can often be further complicated by incomplete or contradictory evidence from historical field surveys that might suggest a very different demographic history. Here, we use the case of the <b>Seychelles</b> <b>kestrel</b> (Falco araea), an island endemic previously listed as critically-endangered but now relatively common, to illustrate how genetic data from microsatellite genotypes of 100 – 150 -year-old museum specimens reveals a recent and severe population crash since the 1940 s to approximately eight individuals, before the population recovered. We re-interpret the historical population trajectory of the <b>Seychelles</b> <b>kestrel</b> {{in the light of the}} minimal intervention required for this species to recover. We examine different ecological explanations for the decline and apparently unassisted recovery of the <b>Seychelles</b> <b>kestrel,</b> review the evidence for similarly unaided recoveries elsewhere and discuss the implications of unaided population recoveries for future species conservation programmes. Demographic profiles from historical genetic signatures can provide highly informative evidence when evaluating past and future recovery efforts for endangered species...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{evolutionary}} relationships of kestrels from mainland Africa, Indian Ocean islands and related areas. We construct a molecular phylogeny of African kestrels, using approximately 1. 0 kb of mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence. Our molecular results support an Old World origin for typical kestrels and an ancient divergence of kestrels into the New World, and indicate a more recent radiation of kestrels from Africa via Madagascar towards Mauritius and the Seychelles. Phylogenetic placement of the Australian kestrel suggests a recent origin from African kestrel stock. We compare evolutionary relationships based on kestrel plumage pattern and morphology to our molecular results for the African and Indian Ocean kestrels, and reveal some consistency with the different island forms. We apply a range of published avian cytochrome b substitution rates to our data, {{as an alternative to}} internal calibration of a molecular clock arising from incomplete paleontological information. We align these divergence estimates to the geological history of Indian Ocean island formation inferred from potassium-argon dating methods. The arrival of kestrels on Mauritius appears consistent with the cessation of volcanic activity on Mauritius. The estimated time and route of divergence of the <b>Seychelles</b> <b>kestrel</b> from Madagascar may be compatible with the emergence of smaller islands during Pleistocene sea level fluctuations...|$|E
