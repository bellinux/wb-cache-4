40|$|Current front turn-signal lamps in the U. S. {{predominantly}} use clear {{lenses and}} amber bulbs. However, clear-lens lamps {{are more susceptible}} than amber-lens lamps to sun reflections that may be interpreted as turn signals (<b>sun</b> <b>phantoms).</b> In this study, we quantified the relevant photometric differences in direct sunlight between these two lamp types for a large sample of current lamps, and presented inferences for likely effects on driver performance. Although our data confirm that, in general, clear-lens lamps are likely to provide signals that are less discriminable, the variability within each lamp type is large. In other words, some clear-lens turn lamps currently on the road {{are likely to be}} resistant to <b>sun</b> <b>phantoms,</b> and some amber-lens lamps are not. The report also discusses the desirable photometric levels of turn signals for effective performance in direct sunlight. Finally, it is argued that an indirect benefit of turn-signal lamps that are near low-beam headlamps is that, because of their higher required intensities, {{they are likely to be}} less susceptible to <b>sun</b> <b>phantoms</b> than lamps farther away from low beams...|$|R

Addressed with equal ardor by that other man, whose age, whose character, whose modest devotion offered her every assurance of happiness that a woman could desire, she had struggled against herself, and had begged him to give her a day to consider. That day was now drawing to an end.

60|$|Cameron {{experienced}} a singular exaltation. He had lightened his comrade's burden. Wonderfully {{it came to}} him that he had also lightened his own. From that hour it was not torment to think of Nell. Walking with his comrade through the silent places, lying beside him under the serene luminous light of the stars, Cameron began to feel the haunting presence of invisible things that were real to him--phantoms whispering peace. In the moan of the cool wind, in the silken seep of sifting sand, in the distant rumble of a slipping ledge, in the faint rush of a shooting star he heard these phantoms of peace coming with whispers of the long pain of men at the last made endurable. Even in the white noonday, under the burning <b>sun,</b> these <b>phantoms</b> came to be real to him. In the dead silence of the midnight hours he heard them breathing nearer on the desert wind--nature's voices of motherhood, whispers of God, peace in the solitude.|$|R

5000|$|In Superman II, as Superman {{saves the}} city of Paris from {{destruction}} by hurling a nuclear bomb into space, the resulting nuclear explosion inadvertently shatters the Phantom Zone and releases the three prisoners. Now free, General Zod and his cohorts travel to Earth, wreaking havoc with the powers granted to them by Earth's yellow <b>sun.</b> The <b>Phantom</b> Zone appears in Richard Donner's cut of Superman II, released in November 2006. In this version (per the original shooting script prior to being altered by director Richard Lester for the theatrical version), the Phantom Zone is shattered by the rocket Superman threw into space in the first Superman film. The Zone is shown splitting into three separate shards, one containing each villain, before it finally shatters, freeing them. Jor-El presents a visual representation of the Phantom Zone and its occupants in a recorded message embedded in the education crystals housed at the Fortress of Solitude, unaware that he is actually talking to Lex Luthor and Miss Teschmacher. After defeating Zod and his followers, Superman uses a time-warp to keep the three criminals imprisoned in the Phantom Zone while undoing the damage they had done during their time on Earth.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} {{feasibility}} of unified intensity-modulated arc therapy (UIMAT) which combines intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) optimization and delivery to produce superior radiation treatment plans, {{both in terms of}} dosedistribution and efficiency of beam delivery when compared with either VMAT or IMRT alone. Methods: An inverse planning algorithm for UIMAT was prototyped within the pinnacle treatment planningsystem (Philips Healthcare). The IMRT and VMAT deliveries are unified within the same arc, with IMRT being delivered at specific gantry angles within the arc. Optimized gantry angles for the IMRT and VMAT phases are assigned automatically by the inverse optimization algorithm. Optimization of the IMRT and VMAT phases is done simultaneously using a direct apertureoptimization algorithm. Five treatment plans each for prostate, head and neck, and lung were generated using a unified optimization technique and compared with clinical IMRT or VMAT plans. Delivery verification was performed with an ArcCheck <b>phantom</b> (<b>Sun</b> Nuclear) on a Varian TrueBeam linear accelerator (Varian Medical Systems). Results: In this prototype implementation, the UIMAT plans offered the same target dose coverage while reducing mean doses to organs at risk by 8. 4 % for head-and-neck cases, 5. 7 % for lung cases, and 3. 5 % for prostate cases, compared with the VMAT or IMRT plans. In addition, UIMAT can bedelivered with similar efficiency as VMAT. Conclusions: In this proof-of-concept work, a novel radiation therapy optimization and delivery technique that interlaces VMAT or IMRT delivery within the same arc has been demonstrated. Initial results show that unified VMAT/IMRT {{has the potential to be}} superior to either standard IMRT or VMAT...|$|R
40|$|On September 28, 351 AD, Emperor Constantius II {{defeated}} the usurper Magnentius {{in the battle}} at Mursa. While the battle is described in several ancient sources, the present study focuses on the account given by Philostorgius. Philostorgius is the first known author to have included in {{his description of the}} battle the appearance of a cross in the sky, drawing on the writings of an unknown Arian historian. But for all its seemingly miraculous connotations, Philostorgius’ story is no mere figment of the imagination. It is based on a perfectly natural meteorological phenomenon, the parhelia or <b>phantom</b> <b>suns,</b> which had been observed on May 7, 351, in the sky above Jerusalem. They were interpreted at the time as the sign of Christ’s cross, and the contemporary Jerusalem bishop, Cyril, provided a detailed description in a letter to Emperor Constantius. But while the Bishop already saw this phenomenon as a sign of God’s favour to Constantius, the appearance of the cross above Jerusalem was not immediately associated with the slightly later conflict at Mursa. This connection was only established by Arian historians, who used the story of the vision before the Mursa battle to glorify Emperor Constantius, a supporter of Arianism. The earliest source known today is an anonymous Arian historian writing in the late 4 th century: his work provided the basis for Philostorgius’ account of the Mursa battle. Still, the association of the visions above Jerusalem and Mursa is perhaps not to be attributed merely to the Arian authors’ partiality to Emperor Constantius. It may have been prompted by two natural but hardly everyday celestial phenomena as well: on May 28, 355, the Balkans, including Mursa, witnessed a total solar eclipse, while August 8, 351, brought a partial eclipse to an area of the Balkans (but not to Mursa). The two eclipses may have influenced Philostorgius’ account of the Mursa battle. While neither the eclipse nor the parhelia visible in Jerusalem could have been seen in the Mursa area in 351, Philostorgius (and his source before him) may have subsequently related the story of {{the sign of the cross}} to the memory of the eclipse. Constantinople had witnessed both eclipses: the later eclipse suggested associations with the Mursa battle because of the temporal proximity, while the earlier was, like the cross above Jerusalem, easily attributed with the help of some pious imagination to Whitsuntide, when Constantius (according to Philostorgius) defeated Magnentius at Mursa. (The Whitsunday of 355 was celebrated on June 4, a mere 6 days after the date of the total eclipse.) In addition to associating the appearance of the cross in the sky above Jerusalem with the battle of Mursa, the reports on the miraculous celestial phenomenon as given by Philostorgius and the anonymous Arian historian diverge from Bishop Cyril’s report in another significant detail. According to both historians, the appearance of the cross above Jerusalem had been accompanied by two other less common phenomena in the sky: a rainbow and a halo around the cross. As Bishop Cyril’s letter to Constantius makes no reference to either, although the parhelion is normally accompanied by both, the anonymous Arian historian as well as Philostorgius after him must have relied on a source which drew on the observations of an unknown eyewitness to the events in Jerusalem – a source that was perhaps unfamiliar with Cyril’s description or complemented it with additional information. The parhelion is a fairly frequent phenomenon, reported in antiquity by pagan as well as by Christian authors. This relative frequency, coupled with a vague memory of the two solar eclipses, may well have contributed to the transfer of the Jerusalem story to the Mursa account. Moreover, Philostorgius seems to have enjoyed writing about miracles, including Constantine’s vision of the cross before the battle of the Milvian Bridge. While his report on the latter is shorter than his account of the conflict at Mursa, the portrayal of Constantine’s vision contains all the essential elements used to describe the appearance of the cross above Jerusalem and Mursa. It might thus be supposed that Philostorgius, who draws on an anonymous Arian historian in extending the vision of the cross from Constantine to Constantine’s son, Constantius, used the elements from his model’s description to complement the extant report on Constantine’s vision...|$|R
