Ten years later, the boy, now a young adult, enters a bar where he is given a list of options to define his name, {{difficulty}} level, <b>special</b> <b>skill,</b> and preferred era. After selecting these, the player must choose which nation to sail with initially: the English, the Dutch, the Spanish, or the French. In every case the voyage on this ship is harsh and the captain treats the hero and his fellow crew like slaves until he incites a mutiny by his ill treatment. The crew sets the captain adrift and names the hero the new captain. After this mutiny, the ship is the hero's and he is located a short distance from a major city of the ship's nationality.|$|E

500|$|Unlike normal gameplay, {{where all}} {{character}} and background graphics are two-dimensional (2D), combat is rendered entirely in 3D. Wild Arms uses a turn-based battle {{system in which}} the player inputs commands at the start of each round designating which actions take place. The order in which each character and enemy performs these actions is based on their [...] "response" [...] (RES) statistic, which denotes how quickly a particular character can act. [...] The higher a character's response, {{the more likely they are}} to act before an enemy. The player has the option every round to either use a restorative item from their inventory, use a <b>special</b> <b>skill,</b> run from combat, or attack. Enemy units are defeated when their hit points, a numerical representation of their vitality, reaches zero. Hit points can be reduced by attacking an enemy, either with standard attacks or spells.|$|E

30|$|The {{problem is}} that, ideally, {{specialist}} registrars {{are expected to}} have accomplished at least two <b>special</b> <b>skills</b> modules before completing their training.

Maybe the answer would be to allow trainees to register for <b>special</b> <b>skills</b> modules before their final two years of training. However, this would raise concerns as to whether they will be ready to undertake those modules at such a junior stage, and whether this may impact on their intermediate core training.|$|R
