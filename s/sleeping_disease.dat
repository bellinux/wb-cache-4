40|$|<b>Sleeping</b> <b>disease</b> in {{rainbow trout}} is {{characterized}} by an abnormal swimming behaviour of the fish which stay on their side {{at the bottom of}} the tanks. This sign is due to extensive necrosis and atrophy of red skeletal muscle induced by the <b>sleeping</b> <b>disease</b> virus (SDV), also called salmonid alphavirus 2. Infections of humans with arthritogenic alphaviruses, such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), are global causes of debilitating musculoskeletal diseases. The mechanisms by which the virus causes these pathologies are poorly understood due to the restrictive availability of animal models capable of reproducing the full spectrum of the disease. Nevertheless, it has been shown that CHIKV exhibits a particular tropism for muscle stem cells also known as satellite cells. Thus, SDV and its host constitute a relevant model to study in details the virus-induced muscle atrophy, the pathophysiological consequences of the infection of a particular cell-type in the skeletal muscle, and the regeneration of the muscle tissue in survivors together with the possible virus persistence. To study a putative SDV tropism for that particular cell type, we established an in vivo and ex vivo rainbow trout model of SDV-induced atrophy of the skeletal muscle. This experimental model allows reproducing the full panel of clinical signs observed during a natural infection since the transmission of the virus is arthropod-borne independent. The virus tropism in the muscle tissue was studied by immunohistochemistry together with the kinetics of the muscle atrophy, and the muscle regeneration post-infection was observed. In parallel, an ex vivo model of SDV infection of rainbow trout satellite cells was developed and virus replication and persistence in that particular cell type was followed up to 73 days post-infection. These results constitute the first observation of a specific SDV tropism for the muscle satellite cells...|$|E

40|$|Changes in {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} (ANS) activity can result {{from a variety of}} factors including physical movement, postural changes, <b>sleeping,</b> <b>disease,</b> and aging. For social and personality psychologists the value of examining the ANS may be that in many situations ANS responses can indicate shifts in emotion, motivation, attention, and preferences. Several obvious advantages of using ANS responses have been well established. For example, ANS responses are not susceptible to self-report biases often engendered in sensitive contexts in which individuals might be unwilling to report their unexpurgated feelings (Gardner, Gabriel, & Deikman, 2000; Guglielmi, 1999). Additionally, obtaining data “on-line ” allows for a dynamic analysis of moment-to-moment reactions that does not require introspective responses from participants. There are, however, some advantages that are less obvious. ANS responses can temporally precede conscious awareness revealing emotional responses or preferences that participants cannot yet report (Bechara, Damasio, Tranel, & Damasio, 1997). Finally, some patterns of ANS responding may be linked to mental and physical health vulnerabilities, which would allow social and personality psychologists, along with clinical and health psychologist, to draw links between social contexts or dispositions and disease etiology and progression.

Among the pathogenic protozoa, Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania donovani are hemoflagellates that cause particularly serious <b>diseases</b> (<b>sleeping</b> sickness, Chagas <b>disease,</b> and leishmaniasis, respectively). The drugs currently available to treat these infections are limited by marginal efficacy, severe toxicity, and spreading drug resistance. Camptothecin is an established antitumor drug and a well-characterized inhibitor of eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I. When trypanosomes or leishmania are treated with camptothecin and then lysed with SDS, both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA are cleaved and covalently linked to protein. This is consistent with the existence of drug-sensitive topoisomerase I activity in both compartments. Camptothecin also inhibits the incorporation of [3 H]thymidine in these parasites.

The etiological agent of PD and SD is salmonid alphavirus (SAV), an unusual {{member of the}} Togaviridae (genus Alphavirus). SAV replicates at lower temperatures in fish. Outbreaks of SAV are associated with large economic losses of ~ 17 to 50 million $/year. Current control strategies rely on vaccination with inactivated virus formulations that are cumbersome to obtain and have intrinsic safety risks. In this research {{we were able to}} obtain non-infectious virus-like particles (VLPs) of SAV via expression of recombinant baculoviruses encoding SAV capsid protein and two major immunodominant viral glycoproteins, E 1 and E 2 in Spodoptera frugiperda Sf 9 insect cells.

40|$|Salmonid alphavirus (SAV; {{also known}} as Salmon {{pancreas}} disease virus; family Togaviridae) causes pancreas disease and <b>sleeping</b> <b>disease</b> in Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout, respectively, and poses a major burden to the aquaculture industry. SAV infection in vivo is temperature-restricted and progeny virus is only produced at low temperatures (10 – 15 °C).

Finally, a vaccination-challenge model in Atlantic salmon demonstrates the biological significance of our findings and shows that SAV replicon DNA vaccines encoding E 2 elicit protective immunity only when E 1 is co-expressed.

40|$|<b>Sleeping</b> <b>disease</b> (SD) is {{currently}} a matter of concern for salmonid fish farmers {{in most parts of}} the world. A viral etiology of SD has recently been suspected, since virus-like particles have been observed in infected rainbow trout cells. In salmonid-derived cell lines, the maximal rate of virus production was observed at 10 °C, while little virus was produced at 14 °C. Through biochemical, physicochemical, and morphological studies, SD virus (SDV) was shown to be an enveloped virus of roughly 60 nm in diameter. The genome consists of 12 kb of RNA, with the appearance of a 26 S subgenomic RNA during the time course of SDV replication. The screening of a random-primed cDNA library constructed from the genomic RNA of semipurified virions facilitated the identification of a specific SDV cDNA clone having an open reading frame related to the alphavirus E 2 glycoproteins. To extend the comparison between SDV structural proteins and the alphavirus protein counterparts, the nucleotide sequence of the total 4. 1 -kb subgenomic RNA has been determined. The 26 S RNA encodes a 1, 324 -amino-acid polyprotein exhibiting typical alphavirus structural protein organization. SDV structural proteins showed several remarkable features compared to other alphaviruses: (i) unusually large individual proteins, (ii) very low homology (ranging from 30 to 34 %) (iii) an unglycosylated E 3 protein, and (iv) and E 1 fusion domain sharing mutations implicated in the pH threshold.

40|$|<b>Sleeping</b> <b>disease</b> virus (SDV) is {{a member}} of the new Salmonid alphavirus genus within the Togaviridae family. The {{single-stranded}} RNA genome of SDV is 11, 894 nucleotides long, excluding the 3 ′ poly(A) tail. A full-length cDNA has been generated; the cDNA was fused to a hammerhead ribozyme sequence at the 5 ′ end and inserted into a transcription plasmid (pcDNA 3) backbone, yielding pSDV. By transfection of pSDV into fish cells, recombinant SDV (rSDV) was successfully recovered. Demonstration of the recovery of rSDV was provided by immunofluorescence assay on rSDV-infected cells and by the presence of a genetic tag, a BlpI restriction enzyme site, introduced into the rSDV RNA genome. SDV infectious cDNA was used for two kinds of experiments (i) to evaluate the impact of various targeted mutations in nsP 2 on viral replication and (ii) to study the virulence of rSDV in trout. For the latter aspect, when juvenile trout were infected by immersion in a water bath with the wild-type virus-like rSDV, no deaths or signs of disease appeared in fish, although they were readily infected. In contrast, cumulative mortality reached 80 % in fish infected with the wild-type SDV (wtSDV). When rSDV-infected fish were challenged with wtSDV 3 and 5 months postinfection, a long-lasting protection was demonstrated. Interestingly, a variant rSDV (rSDV 14) adapted to grow at a higher temperature, 14 °C instead of 10 °C, was shown to become pathogenic for trout.

Phylogenetic analysis places SPDV and SDV between the New World viruses of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and Eastern equine encephalitis virus and the Old World viruses of Aura virus and Sindbis virus. When compared to each other, SPDV and SDV show 91. 1 % nucleotide sequence identity over their complete genomes, with 95 and 93. 6 % amino acid identities over their nonstructural and structural proteins, respectively. Notable {{differences between the}} two viruses include a 24 -nucleotide insertion in the C terminus of nsP 3 protein of SPDV and amino acid sequence variation at the C termini of the capsid and E 1 proteins. Experimental infections of Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout with SPDV and SDV confirmed that the disease lesions induced by SPDV and SDV were similar in nature. Although infections with SPDV and SDV produced similar levels of histopathology in rainbow trout, SDV induced significantly less severe lesions in salmon than did SPDV. Virus neutralization tests performed with sera from experimentally infected salmon indicated that SPDV and SDV belonged to the same serotype; however, antigenic variation was detected among SDV and geographically different SPDV isolates by using monoclonal antibodies.
