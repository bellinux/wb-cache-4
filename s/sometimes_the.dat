5|$|The male half wears a jata-mukuta (a headdress formed of piled, matted hair) on his head, {{adorned with}} a {{crescent}} moon. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>the</b> jata-mukuta is adorned with serpents and the river goddess Ganga flowing through the hair. The right ear wears a nakra-kundala, sarpa-kundala ("serpent-earring") or ordinary kundala ("earring"). <b>Sometimes,</b> <b>the</b> male eye is depicted smaller than the female one and a half-moustache is also seen. A half third eye (trinetra) is prescribed on the male side of the forehead in the canons; a full eye may also be depicted in middle of forehead separated by both the sides or a half eye may be shown above or below Parvati's round dot. A common elliptical halo (prabhamandala/prabhavali) may be depicted behind the head; <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> shape of the halo may differ on either side.|$|E
5|$|Adult Eurasian rock pipits have a {{complete}} moult in August–September, at which time juveniles replace their body and some wing covert feathers, giving them an appearance very like the adults.

5|$|Although it {{is still}} {{commonly}} parboiled before preparation, evidence suggests that even this procedure may not make Gyromitra esculenta entirely safe for consumption. When consumed, the principal active agent, gyromitrin, is hydrolyzed into the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine (MMH). The toxin affects the liver, central nervous system, and <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> kidneys. Symptoms of poisoning involve vomiting and diarrhea several hours after consumption, followed by dizziness, lethargy and headache. Severe cases may lead to delirium, coma and death after five to seven days.|$|E

5|$|Although the MSS was {{the most}} useful {{instrument}} on Landsat 2, <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> data recorded was anomalous. The U.S. Geological Service (USGS) would identify these anomalies and document them. Known issues on the MSS are: banding, coherent noise, data loss, impulse noise, oversaturation, scan correlated shift (SCS), scan mirror pulse, and transmission striping. Transmission striping occurred when data from an individual sensor was lost. Most commonly, multiple data losses occurred simultaneously, resulting in an image with colored bands on it. This form of data anomaly could not be corrected in post processing.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the colored}} volva, A.atkinsoniana resembles A.onusta, which differs from A.atkinsoniana {{by the small}} to {{medium-sized}} fruit bodies with a grayish veil as dark gray to brownish gray warts and a basal bulb which is usually somewhat rooting. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>the</b> fruit bodies of A.atkinsoniana are confused with A.microlepsis which can be distinguished {{by the presence of}} reddish-brown to grayish-brown volval remnants and the rooting bulb of A.atkinsoniana.|$|E
5|$|Before his {{execution}} {{a convicted felon}} was usually detained in custody for three market days, on each {{of which he was}} publicly displayed in the stocks, accompanied by the stolen goods.

5|$|Conservapedia's {{article on}} {{evolution}} presents evolution as a naturalistic theory that lacks support and that conflicts with {{evidence in the}} fossil record that creationists perceive to support creationism. The entry also suggests that <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> Bible has been more scientifically correct than the scientific community. Schlafly has defended the statement as presenting an alternative to evolution.|$|E
5|$|Decorated rustication. Sebastiano Serlio had {{decorated}} the blocks of ashlar in his rustication; {{by the end}} of the 16th century, Sicilian architects were ornamenting the blocks with carvings of leaves, fish-scales, and even sweets and shells; shells were later to become among the most prevalent ornamental symbols of Baroque design. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>the</b> rustication would be used for pillars rather than walls, a reversal of expectations and almost an architectural joke (illustration 2).|$|E
5|$|Distortion in the molars is {{the most}} common health problem found in woolly mammoth fossils. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>the</b> {{replacement}} was disrupted, and the molars were pushed into abnormal positions, but some animals are known to have survived this.

They can move {{backwards}} and forwards through {{statements in the}} testimony, and can choose to press the witness {{for more information on}} a particular statement; <b>sometimes,</b> <b>the</b> witness will revise their testimony based on this. If the player spots a lie or a contradiction in the testimony, they can present evidence to demonstrate the contradiction. If the player presents incorrect evidence, the judge's confidence in the player will be lowered; if the judge's confidence in the player is depleted, the game ends.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the wings}} {{consists}} of a thin membrane supported by a system of veins. The membrane is formed by two layers of integument closely apposed, while the veins are formed where the two layers remain separate; <b>sometimes</b> <b>the</b> lower cuticle is thicker and more heavily sclerotized under a vein. Within each of the major veins there is a nerve and a trachea, and, since the cavities of the veins are connected with the hemocoel, hemolymph can flow into the wings.|$|E

It is also common under pines. The most similar and also the most closely related fungus is Lactarius fennoscandicus, a boreal to subalpine species. Its cap is distinctly zoned and brown-orange. <b>Sometimes</b> <b>the</b> cap has purple-grey tones. The stem is pale to blunt orange-ochre.|$|E
