5|$|Walter Law was {{a friend}} of Andrew Carnegie, who {{described}} Law as always having an interest in reading and writing. When he found a phrase to be clever or intriguing, Law would document it for further use. Carnegie wrote that Law often made new friends, and had an attractive personality. Law's personal interest was largely in his personal library of 7,000 volumes, which he collected for more than forty years. His library was said to contain many works of classic literature and history; on a vacation to Europe, Law mostly spent time in Greece visiting historic sites. He was {{also a member of the}} Alpine Club, Aldine Association, the American Fine Arts Society, Ardsley Casino (now Ardsley Country Club), the Astronomical <b>Society</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific,</b> New York's Century Association, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Players, and Sleepy Hollow Country Club. Law and his wife were on the Aqueduct Guard Citizens' Committee, a committee tasked with providing for the needs of the New York Guard troops who were protecting the Old Croton Aqueduct during World War I. In 1892, Law also received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Yale University.|$|E

The dance is so {{important}} that each variety has to be carefully staged and prepared for. Special members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tribe are designated to survey particular dances to see if they've been performed to satisfaction. Mistakes and poorly conducted dances could mean a loss of social position, or <b>the</b> stiffness <b>of</b> penalties; such as having to host a potlatch to regain prestige. The German anthropologist Franz Boas found a total of fifty-three different characters in Kwakwaka'wakw dance, each of them with a different role.|$|R

In Tonga, middle classes both reproduce aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> older rank-based system with which they continue to coexist and innovate new forms of acting and being, many of which emerged with <b>the</b> diasporic explosion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>society.</b> While "middle-classness" is fragile and shifting, it is constituted by four important characteristics: an intense awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extralocal; a valorization of consumption; multiple modes <b>of</b> livelihood; and <b>the</b> commoditization <b>of</b> structures of reciprocity.
