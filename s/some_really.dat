500|$|The video {{generally}} received positive reception, although Dupri's cameo {{was ultimately}} panned. A review considered {{the portrayal of}} Jackson [...] "walking down <b>some</b> <b>really</b> shady parts of the neighbourhood in pursuit of Jermaine Dupri" [...] as unrealistic. In an interview with Launch.com, Jackson said she was not hesitant to feature Dupri in the video, although revealed it was the director's idea to do so.|$|E
500|$|Some reviewers {{complained about}} the episode's length. A Buzzsugar.com review stated that [...] "there was {{something}} off about this week's episode. It's never really a good thing when I'm checking the clock and feeling antsy at the 20-minute mark of an hour-long episode." [...] An IGN review said [...] "while there's <b>some</b> <b>really</b> funny moments in this episode, overall I really started to feel that hour running time. Of course, as always, that doesn't make this a bad episode, just not one of their best." ...|$|E

He added, [...] "there were <b>some</b> <b>really</b> loving, caring moments between four people: a hotel room here and there – a really amazing closeness. Just four guys who loved each other.

500|$|Many {{critics also}} praised Current's guitar {{work on the}} album, with Richards writing that his riffs [...] "come ripping from his {{amplifier}} like sunbeams through a smog of distortion". Writing for Spin, Chuck Eddy wrote that Current's guitar chords [...] "soar Byrds-like or surf Ventures-like out of melodic stomps that seem basic, but aren't". K. Ross Hoffman, writing for Allmusic, praised the song [...] "Wrapped Up" [...] for its [...] "strong, slinky riff", while Bevan praised it for the way it [...] "runs along <b>some</b> <b>really</b> beautiful ribbons of guitar melody".|$|E

500|$|The exact {{genre of}} Nightcrawler {{has been the}} subject of debate. While most critics agree that the film {{predominantly}} features thriller elements, other descriptions have been used, including dark comedy, drama, horror, and neo-noir. When asked about the film's genre, Gilroy stated: [...] "I see Nightcrawler as having genre elements in the sense that it’s a thriller. It also has some strong dramatic elements and I think I understand the question as there's <b>some</b> <b>really</b> strong elements of drama." [...] Gyllenhaal particularly noted the comedic elements, commenting: [...] "Gilroy and I were laughing pretty much the whole movie." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} {{were almost}} universally praised. Andrew Bub of GameSpy asserted that Nintendo should have used Iridion to advertise the Game Boy Advance, {{as it took}} {{full advantage of the}} system's power. A year after its release, TechTV's Miguel Concepcion argued it was still the best-looking game for the system. Miguel Lopez of GameSpot lauded the graphics, writing that [...] "while it's ultimately all smoke and mirrors, Iridions world is richly detailed, has remarkable depth, and is unbelievably fluid. It's often hard to tell if the game's backgrounds are composed of streaming full motion video or just <b>some</b> <b>really</b> fancy math-powered 2D bitmaps." ...|$|E

500|$|The ship's {{constant}} movement also impacted character animation. Once the ship's movement reached a certain angle, Hansen {{and any other}} characters on deck start to slide, and have to compensate in whatever direction was necessary relative to their position. According to Levastre, this meant Hansen required nine times the animations usually seen in third-person games (center, front, back, left, right and four intermediary positions). Ultimately, Hansen had {{two hundred and fifty}} separate animations, and most of the non-player characters had one hundred and fifty. According to Antonin Delboy, lead animator on the game, [...] "all the technical decisions were taken in favor of animation, both in terms of quality and quantity, which is very rare on this kind of project." [...] Basic animation was produced with 3D Studio Max software. Inverse kinematics were then used to create the nine directional animations, with the engine calculating the level of character compensation depending on the angle of the ship. Each character movement is composed of basic animation and compensation animation, and Delboy says that in total, the game contains more than nine hundred animations, allowing for over five thousand possible movements. Levastre stated [...] "The interaction between the storm and the characters that are on the deck sometimes creates <b>some</b> <b>really</b> breathtaking moments. And on top of that, we managed to offer <b>some</b> <b>really</b> intense action sequences featuring far more enemies than in most horror games." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post also praised Ramirez's performance, {{calling her}} [...] "the most genuine character". Although he enjoyed Ramirez's performance, Pascua was {{critical}} {{of the rest of}} the episode, writing: [...] "The funeral wasn't as sad as I thought it would be. There were so many pre-episode pictures up that I thought the funeral would take up half the show, then it was five minutes and it wasn't sad at all. The core group walked away and Izzie spread the giggles. She laughs at the fact that she has cancer, like this was all <b>some</b> <b>really</b> badly written show. Oh wait, it is." ...|$|E

I don't know. We have <b>some</b> <b>really</b> cool albums, but I don't think we'll ever do that again." [...] King was equally unsure, commenting, [...] "Probably not.

500|$|The band {{immediately}} started {{to search for}} a replacement vocalist and found Howard Jones of Blood Has Been Shed. Jones disliked the band's sound when he first heard it. He commented, [...] "I was like, 'Meh.' I come from hardcore and dirtier metal, and Killswitch sounded so clean. But the more I listened to it, I realized there's <b>some</b> <b>really</b> good songs here". After hearing about Leach's vocal problems, Jones contacted the band and was accepted as the replacement. Philip Labonte of All That Remains tried out for lead vocals but lost to Jones, who had to quickly memorize seven songs for his debut at the 2002 Hellfest.|$|E
500|$|The voice actors {{also showed}} {{appreciation}} for adult fans. Andrea Libman, who plays Pinkie Pie and Fluttershy, {{found that more}} people wanted to meet her {{as a result of}} the show, and commented that among the fan community, [...] "there's <b>some</b> <b>really</b> talented artists doing really amazing stuff".

Kavner commented, [...] "What I do is not mimicry or an impersonation, but more of an assimilation. [...] {{we did a lot of}} looking at people to find out who to base our characters on.

[...] Shahryar Rizvi of Dallas Observer gave the song a mixed review, criticizing its lyrics: [...] " [...] {{if you read}} between the lines in 'It Girl', it becomes clear that Derulo has <b>some</b> <b>really</b> weird taste in women." [...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the song a negative review, [...] "with the charts now welcoming the return of the organic singer-songwriter", Derulo may not have equipped enough himself with [...] "his own gut-wrenching ballad." ...|$|E
500|$|Unusual filming {{techniques}} were also used.

[...] On the subject of using not only a challengingly minuscule method of filming but also additional sound effects, supervising producer Paul Rabwin recounts, [...] "I had to set up a very, very highly magnified lens to try to get this little device coming right at us.
