40|$|Mastitis, an {{inflammation}} of the mammary glands, is a major disease affecting dairy animal worldwide. Propionate {{is one of the}} main short-chain fatty acid that can exert multiple effects on the inflammatory process. The purpose of this study is to investigate the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate</b> against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced mastitis model in mice. The data mainly confirm that inflammation and blood–milk barrier breakdown contribute to progression of the disease in this model. In mice with LPS, <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate</b> attenuates the LPS-induced histopathological changes, inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), and interleukin- 1 β (IL- 1 β) production, myeloperoxidase activity in mammary tissues. Given their importance in the blood–milk barrier, tight junction proteins occludin and claudin- 3 are further investigated. Our results show that <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate</b> strikingly increases the expressions of occludin and claudin- 3 and reduces the blood–milk barrier permeability in this model. Furthermore, in LPS-stimulated mouse mammary epithelial cells (mMECs), LPS increased the expressions of phosphorylated (p) -p 65, p-IκB proteins, which is attenuated by <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate.</b> Finally, we examine the possibility that propionate acts as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, the results show that both <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate</b> and trichostatin A increase the level of histone H 3 acetylation and inhibit the increased production of TNF-α, IL- 6, and IL- 1 β in LPS-stimulated mMECs. These data suggest that <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate</b> protects against LPS-induced mastitis mainly by restoring blood–milk barrier disruption and suppressing inflammation via NF-κB signaling pathway and HDAC inhibition...|$|E

Paracetamol was included in bread products with added lactic acid or <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate</b> and used as a marker for the rate of gastric emptying in healthy subjects. In parallel, postprandial glycemia, insulinemia, and satiety were evaluated. The influence of lactic acid, propionic acid, and <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate</b> was also studied in rats after they were tube-fed with glucose solutions. The bread products with lactic acid or <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate</b> both lowered blood glucose and insulin responses. The bread with <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate</b> also prolonged satiety. The reason for the lowered metabolic responses with <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate</b> was probably a lowered {{gastric emptying rate}}, as judged from reduced blood paracetamol concen-trations; {{there was no such}} effect observed with bread with added lactic acid. A similar amount of lactic acid in solution tube-fed to rats did not affect the disappearence of glucose from the stomach. In contrast with the finding in humans, <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate</b> had no effect on the rate of gastric emptying in rats whereas an equimolar solution of propionic acid reduced gastric emptying rate in rats. Possibly, less of this acid was produced in the gastric contents after a bolus load of a <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate</b> solution (in rats) than in an eating situation. Also, the pH and/or the osmolarity may be im-portant, and when provided in excessive amounts, lactic acid reduced the gastric emptying rate in rats.

40|$|Whole-cell (ICa) {{and single}} Ca 2 + channel {{currents}} were measured in inspiratory neurones of neonatal mice (4 – 12 days old). During whole-cell recordings, ICa slowly declined and disappeared within 10 – 20 min. The run-down was delayed during hypoxia, indicating ICa potentiation. Ca 2 + channels {{were recorded in}} cell-attached patches using pipettes which contained 110 mm Ba 2 +. L-type Ca 2 + channels exhibited a non-ohmic I–V relationship. The slope conductance was 24 pS below and 50 pS above their null potential. The open probability of the channels increased during oxygen depletion, reaching a maximum 2 min after the onset of hypoxia. Restoration of the oxygen supply brought the channel activity back to initial levels. The channel activity was enhanced by 3 – 30 μmS(–) Bay K 8644, an agonist of L-type Ca 2 + channels. The open probability was increased about 3 -fold and the activation curve was shifted by 20 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction. In {{the presence of the}} agonist, channel open time increased and long openings appeared. Agonist-modulated channels were also potentiated during oxygen depletion. The effect was due to an increase in open time and a decrease in closed time. The channels were inhibited by bath application of nifedipine (10 μm) and nitrendipine (20 μm). Weak bases such as NH 4 Cl and TMA increased and weak acids such as <b>sodium</b> acetate and <b>propionate</b> decreased activity of the channels, indicating that they are modulated by intracellular pH. Bath application of 1 μm forskolin enhanced the channel activity, whereas 500 μm NaF suppressed it. L-type Ca 2 + channels were modulated by an agonist for mGluR 1 / 5 receptors, (S) - 3, 5 -dihydrophenylglycine (DHPG, 5 μm). In its presence, the hypoxic facilitation of channels was abolished. After blockade of L-type Ca 2 + channels, the respiratory response to hypoxia was modified. The transient enhancement of the respiratory rhythm (augmentation) was no longer evident and the secondary depression occurred earlier. We suggest that L-type Ca 2 + channels contribute to the early hypoxic response of the respiratory centre. Glutamate release during hypoxia stimulates postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors, which activate the Ca 2 + channels...|$|R
40|$|The human colon {{adenocarcinoma}} {{cell line}} HT- 29 in culture exhibits a cyclic AMP production system highly sensitive to vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), making HT- 29 cells a unique cultured cell system {{for studying the}} mechanism of VIP action [Laburthe, Rousset, Boissard, Chevalier, Zweibaum & Rosselin (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 75, 2772 - 2775]. The quantitative characteristics of VIP receptors in HT- 29 cells and their structural requirement and molecular size were studied. 125 I-labeled VIP bound in a time-dependent manner to HT- 29 cell homogenates. At equilibrium (60 min incubation at 30 degrees C), unlabelled VIP in the 0. 01 - 10 nM concentration range competed with 125 I-VIP for binding to cell homogenates. Scatchard analysis of binding data gave a straight line, indicating that VIP bound to a single population of sites with a KD of 0. 12 +/- 0. 02 nM and a capacity of 120 +/- 9 fmol/mg of protein. The structural requirement of these receptors was studied with peptides structurally related to VIP, either natural or synthetic. Several peptides inhibited 125 I-VIP binding to HT- 29 cell homogenates with the following order of potency, which {{is typical of the}} human VIP receptor: VIP (IC 50 = 0. 1 nM) greater than VIP-(2 - 28) -peptide (IC 50 = 13 nM) greater than human growth hormone releasing factor (IC 50 = 56 nM) greater than peptide histidine isoleucine amide (IC 50 = 80 nM) greater than secretin (IC 50 greater than 10 000 nM). To characterize the molecular component(s) of the VIP receptor in HT- 29 cells, 125 I-VIP was covalently bound to cell homogenates by using the cross-linker dithiobis(succinimidyl <b>propionate).</b> <b>Sodium</b> dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel autoradiographic studies of affinity-labelled cell homogenates revealed two major bands, corresponding to 125 I-VIP-protein complexes of Mr 66 000 and 16 000. The labelling of the Mr- 66 000 component was specific, since it was abolished by native VIP, whereas that of the Mr- 16 000 component was not. Densitometric scanning of autoradiographs indicated that the labelling of the Mr- 66 000 complex was inhibited by low VIP concentrations in the 0. 1 - 10 nM range (IC 50 = 0. 6 nM), but was unaffected by 1 microM-glucagon or octapeptide of cholecystokinin. It was also decreased by VIP-(2 - 28) -peptide with a potency 1 % that of VIP.

40|$|Background: Foods {{with a low}} glycemic index are {{increasingly}} being acknowledged as beneficial for individuals with disorders related to the insulin resistance syndrome. The presence of certain salts of organic acids {{has been shown to}} lower the glycemic index of bread products and one of the suggested mechanisms is a lowered gastric emptying rate (GER). One obvious pitfall with many of the common techniques for GER measurement is that the food structure, and hence the gastric release of nutrients, may be affected by enclosure of the marker for gastric emptying, eg, paracetamol. Ultrasonography is a noninvasive method for which the above pitfall is to a large extent avoided. Objective: The main objective was to evaluate the use of ultrasonography to determine whether the lowered glycemic and insulinemic responses to bread ingestion after the addition of <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate</b> are explained by a specific effect of propionate on the GER. Design: The effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate</b> in bread was evaluated in 9 healthy volunteers. Barley bread products, with or without added <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate,</b> were ingested as breakfast after an overnight fast. The GER was monitored for 2 h by ultrasonography; during this period, capillary blood was withdrawn repeatedly for measurement of blood glucose and insulin.

40|$|To {{identify}} plasma metabolites used as biomarkers {{in order}} to distinguish cirrhotics from controls and encephalopathics. A clinical study involving stable cirrhotic patients with and without overt hepatic encephalopathy was designed. A control group of healthy volunteers was used. Plasma from those patients was analysed using 1 H - nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We used the Carr Purcell Meiboom Gill sequence to process the sample spectra at ambient probe temperature. We used a gated secondary irradiation field for water signal suppression. Samples were calibrated and referenced using the <b>sodium</b> trimethyl silyl <b>propionate</b> peak at 0. 00 ppm. For each sample 128 transients (FID's) were acquired into 32 K complex data points over a spectral width of 6 KHz. 30 degree pulses were applied with an acquisition time of 4. 0 s {{in order to}} achieve better resolution, followed by a recovery delay of 12 s, to allow for complete relaxation and recovery of the magnetisation. A metabolic profile was created for stable cirrhotic patients without signs of overt hepatic encephalopathy and encephalopathic patients as well as healthy controls. Stepwise discriminant analysis was then used and discriminant factors were created to differentiate between the three groups. Eighteen stabled cirrhotic patients, eighteen patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy and seventeen healthy volunteers were recruited. Patients with cirrhosis had significantly impaired ketone body metabolism, urea synthesis and gluconeogenesis. This was demonstrated by higher concentrations of acetoacetate (0. 23 ± 0. 02 vs 0. 05 ± 0. 00, P < 0. 01), and b-hydroxybutarate (0. 58 ± 0. 14 vs 0. 08 ± 0. 00, P < 0. 01), lower concentrations of glutamine (0. 44 ± 0. 08 vs 0. 63 ± 0. 03, P < 0. 05), histidine (0. 16 ± 0. 01 vs 0. 36 ± 0. 04, P < 0. 01) and arginine (0. 08 ± 0. 01 vs 0. 14 ± 0. 02, P < 0. 03) and higher concentrations of glutamate (1. 36 ± 0. 25 vs 0. 58 ± 0. 04, P < 0. 01), lactate (1. 53 ± 0. 11 vs 0. 42 ± 0. 05, P < 0. 01), pyruvate (0. 11 ± 0. 02 vs 0. 03 ± 0. 00, P < 0. 01) threonine (0. 39 ± 0. 02 vs 0. 08 ± 0. 01, P < 0. 01) and aspartate (0. 37 ± 0. 03 vs 0. 03 ± 0. 01). A five metabolite signature by stepwise discriminant analysis could separate between controls and cirrhotic patients with an accuracy of 98 %. In patients with encephalopathy we observed further derangement of ketone body metabolism, impaired production of glycerol and myoinositol, reversal of Fischer's ratio and impaired glutamine production as demonstrated by lower b-hydroxybutyrate (0. 58 ± 0. 14 vs 0. 16 ± 0. 02, P < 0. 0002), higher acetoacetate (0. 23 ± 0. 02 vs 0. 41 ± 0. 16, P < 0. 05), leucine (0. 33 ± 0. 02 vs 0. 49 ± 0. 05, P < 0. 005) and isoleucine (0. 12 ± 0. 02 vs 0. 27 ± 0. 02, P < 0. 0004) and lower glutamine (0. 44 ± 0. 08 vs 0. 36 ± 0. 04, P < 0. 013), glycerol (0. 53 ± 0. 03 vs 0. 19 ± 0. 02, P < 0. 000) and myoinositol (0. 36 ± 0. 04 vs 0. 18 ± 0. 02, P < 0. 010) concentrations.

40|$|Metabolic {{flexibility}} {{is defined as}} the ability of an organism to adapt from fuel oxidation to fuel availability. It is well established that obesity results in loss of metabolic flexibility, however, the exact mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, it is critical to understand the mechanism underlying metabolic flexibility to tackle the epidemic of obesity. An energy-restricted diet will lead to weight loss. However, little is known regarding the mechanisms behind the improvement in metabolic flexibility with weight loss following an energy-restricted diet. In investigation 1, I compared the effects of an energy-restricted diet and a control diet over 12 weeks on overweight and obese volunteers to elucidate the underlying mechanism of metabolic flexibility. The results demonstrated that weight loss is associated with significant reductions in body fat composition, waist circumference, hip circumference, visceral fats, blood pressure, and an improvement in postprandial insulin sensitivity. This translates into an improvement in metabolic health and metabolic flexibility. However, the underlying mechanism remained unclear. Furthermore, dietary modification using short chain fatty acids provides an attractive avenue to improve metabolic flexibility. However, the evidence for the role of short chain fatty acids in improving human metabolic {{flexibility is}} lacking.

40|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activity of}} organic acids {{in combination with}} nonchemical treatments was evaluated for inactivation of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium within 1 min. It was observed that {{the effectiveness of the}} multiple-hurdle treatments was temperature (P ≤ 0. 05) and pH (P ≤ 0. 05) dependent and corresponded to the degree of organic acid lipophilicity (sodium acetate being least effective and <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate</b> being the most effective). This led to the hypothesis that the loss in viability was due at least in part to cell membrane disruption. Evaluation of osmotic response, potassium ion leakage, and transmission electron micrographs confirmed treatment effects on the cell membrane. Interestingly, all treatments, even those with no effect on viability, such as with sodium acetate, resulted in measurable cellular stress. Microarray experiments explored the specific response of S. Typhimurium to sodium acetate and <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate,</b> the most similar of the tested treatments in terms of pKa and ionic strength, and found little difference in the changes in gene expression following exposure to either, despite their very different effects on viability. Taken together, the results reported support our hypothesis that treatment with heated, acidified, organic acid salt solutions for 1 min causes loss of S. Typhimurium viability at least in part by membrane damage and that the degree of effectiveness can be correlated with lipophilicity of the organic acid. Overall, the data presented here indicate that a combined thermal, acidified <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate</b> treatment can provide an effective antimicrobial treatment against Salmonella...|$|E

40|$|The {{miscibility}} {{range for}} water- sodium propionate- pentanol mixtures {{has been determined}} at 298 K. The phase equilibria are compared with ‘normal’ and ‘ detergentless ’ microemulsion systems. <b>Sodium</b> <b>propionate</b> imposes a very slight salting out action (if any) on pentanol in dilute aqueous solutions. However, pentanol gains full miscibility with concentrated salt solutions. Volumetry was chosen to detect the interactions between the components since {{it has been found}} to monitor both changes in the environment of the hydrocarbon chains as well as large shifts in the polar association equilibria. According to the apparent molar volumes the enhanced solubility of pentanol is apparently obtained through dissociation of the alcohol com-plexes. Interestingly the concentrated hydrotrope solvent seems to be apolar in character. The state of the hydrotrope is almost entirely determined by the relative amount of (hydration) water. The interaction between pentanol and <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate</b> also seems to be of importance in dilute pentanol solutions. The absence of extended association structures in the syste...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper aims {{to study}} the impact of {{different}} carbon sources on phosphorus removal after the (AO) 2 SBR system was started successfully. Four kinds of carbon resources were used in sequence experiments to observe the impact of different carbon resources on phosphorus release at anaerobic condition, uptake aerobic condition, uptake anoxic condition and phosphorus removal of the (AO) 2 SBR system. And the carbon sources are sodium acetate, <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate,</b> glucose, sodium acetate + <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate</b> separately. The experiment result shows that the phosphorus release and uptake of active sludge at anaerobic/aerobic/anoxic condition was preferable with sodium acetate as carbon source. And the phosphorus removal rate of (AO) 2 SBR system and TP concentration in the effluent were 95 % and under 0. 5 mg·L- 1 respectively. The phosphorus removal rate of (AO) 2 SBR system was only 60 % with glucose as carbon resource. This study concluded that it is beneficial for the biological phosphorus removal to choose organics with short carbon chain, such as sodium acetate, as carbon source...|$|E

Acesso restrito. p. 1 - 7 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of sodium lactate and <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate,</b> both in combination with sodium acetate, on strains of Listeria monocytogenes in artificially inoculated soft cheeses. Minas Frescal and Coalho cheeses, inoculated with a mix of L. monocytogenes 1 ⁄ 2 a and Scott A, underwent two treatments: 2 % (w ⁄ v) sodium lactate in combination with 0. 25 % (w ⁄ v) sodium acetate and 2 % (w ⁄ v) <b>sodium</b> <b>propionate</b> in combination with 0. 25 % (w ⁄ v) sodium acetate. The samples were analysed immediately and after 7 days at 10 C. The growth of the pathogen was inhibited in cheeses containing the salts of organic acids, and the effects of treatment were statistically significant (P < 0. 05). However, there was no difference between the types of treatment applied. Our data demonstrate that the effectiveness of the salts of organic acids depended on the initial concentration of L. monocytogenes and that a higher concentration of the salts is necessary to ensure sustained inactivation of target pathogens because they are weakly antilisterial when the soft cheeses are stored at 10 C...|$|E
