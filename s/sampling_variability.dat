It can occur during data collection, coding, transfer, or analysis.

30|$|Principal {{component}} {{analysis of the}} 947 superimposed configurations {{in the space of}} the 78 form variables showed a substantial proportion of the total <b>sample</b> <b>variability</b> in the first four PCs (26 %, 10 %, 8 %, and 5 %, resp.). The variance on PCs beyond the third (all 5 % or less of the total) trail off gradually suggesting no strong patterns of intercorrelation amongst the variables. Nonetheless, the first two PCs together only represent 36 % of total <b>sample</b> <b>variability</b> and the first four only 49 %. In fact, it requires the first 27 PCs as a group to account for 90 % of total sample variation. This suggests that the bivariate approach used in constructing fit panels may be ignoring a substantial and important aspect of total <b>sample</b> <b>variability.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A power {{analysis}} allows {{estimation of the}} probability of detecting upward or downward trends in abundance using linear regression, given number of samples and estimates of <b>sample</b> <b>variability</b> and rate of change. Alternatively, the minimum number or precision of samples required to detect trends with a given degree of confidence can be computed. The results are applicable to an experimental situation in which samples are taken at regular intervals in time or space. The effects of linear and exponential change and of having <b>sample</b> <b>variability</b> {{be a function of}} abundance are investigated. Results are summarized graphically and, as an example, applied to the monitoring of the California sea otter population with aerial surveys...|$|R

40|$|Ever {{since the}} days of Francis Bacon it has been claimed that people {{perceive}} the world as less variable and more regular than it actually is. Such misperception, if shown to exist, could explain a host of perplexing behaviors. However, the only evidence supporting the claim is indirect, and there is no explanation of its cause. As a possible cause, we suggest the use of <b>sample</b> <b>variability</b> as an estimate of population variability. This is so since the sampling distribution of sample variance is downward attenuated, the attenuation being substantial for sample sizes that people are likely to consider. The results of five experiments show that people use <b>sample</b> <b>variability,</b> uncorrected for <b>sample</b> size, in tasks in which a correction is normatively called for, and indeed perceive variability as smaller than it actually is. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of inter-annual {{variability}} and serial correlation on the statistical power of monitoring schemes to detect trends in biomass of bream (Abramis brama) in Lake Veluwemeer (The Netherlands). In order to distinguish between `trueÂ¿ system variability and <b>sampling</b> <b>variability</b> we simulated {{the development of the}} bream population, using estimates for population structure and growth, and compared the resulting inter-annual variabilities and serial correlations with those from field data. In all cases the inter-annual variability in the field data was larger than in simulated data (e. g. for total biomass of all assessed bream Â¿Â¿=Â¿ 0. 45 in field data, and Â¿Â¿=Â¿ 0. 03 Â¿ 0. 14 in simulated data) indicating that <b>sampling</b> <b>variability</b> decreased statistical power for detecting trends. Moreover, <b>sampling</b> <b>variability</b> obscured the inter-annual dependency (and thus the serial correlation) of biomass, which was expected because in this long-lived population biomass changes are buffered by the many year classes present. We did find the expected serial correlation in our simulation results and concluded that good survey data of long-lived fish populations should show low <b>sampling</b> <b>variability</b> and considerable inter-annual serial correlation. Since serial correlation decreases the power for detecting trends, this means that even when <b>sampling</b> <b>variability</b> would be greatly reduced, the number of sampling years to detect a change of 15 %Â·yearÂ¿ 1 in bream populations (corresponding to a halving or doubling in a six-year period) would in most cases be more than six.

40|$|Recent {{analyses}} {{have claimed}} the possible presence of non-stationarity, {{produced by the}} presence of either trend or long-term climatic fluctuations, in some historical hydrometeorological records observed in Europe as well as in other countries. Such non-stationarity might exert a remarkable effect on the estimation of the frequency distribution of the extreme events. However, {{it is well known that}} a reliable assessment of the presence of non-stationarity in hydrological records is not an easy task, because of the limited extension of the available data sets. This makes difficult distinguishing between non-stationarity, <b>sample</b> <b>variability</b> and long-term climatic fluctuations. This paper analyses two long rainfall records observed in the Emilia-Romagna region, in Northern Italy, in order to assess whether non-stationarity might be present. The results are compared with the outcomes of regional analyses aimed at assessing the presence of non-stationarity at regional scale. Moreover, some synthetic data are analysed, in order to assess how much the <b>sample</b> <b>variability</b> of a short stationary series might induce effects which could at first glance be ascribed to non-stationarity. ...|$|R

Among their findings, they found that, the overall sample standard deviation, the between <b>sample</b> <b>variability</b> of the individual error rates of the function (QDF) under normal or non-normal distributions was quite large. In the computation of the overall sample standard deviation, the between <b>sample</b> <b>variability</b> of the individual error rates in the QDF on normal or non-normal distributions was quite large and for that instability of QDF is pronounced. Also the actual error rates were considerably larger than the optimal rates in the case of zero mean difference (this is a very difficult problem in assignment). The QDF for non-normal samples generally did not do substantially worse than when the QDF was derived under normal samples which were obtained after transformation. Lachenbruch etÂ al.
