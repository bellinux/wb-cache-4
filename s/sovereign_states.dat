5|$|James VI and I (James Charles Stuart; 19 June 1566– 27 March 1625) was King of Scotland as James VI from 24 July 1567 and King of England and Ireland as James I {{from the}} union of the Scottish and English crowns on 24 March 1603 {{until his death in}} 1625. The kingdoms of Scotland and England were {{individual}} <b>sovereign</b> <b>states,</b> with their own parliaments, judiciary, and laws, though both were ruled by James in personal union.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{ratification}} {{and implementation of}} the United States Constitution, the thirteen <b>sovereign</b> <b>states</b> followed the Articles of Confederation, created by the Second Continental Congress and ratified in 1781. However, the national government that operated under the Articles of Confederation was too weak to adequately regulate the various conflicts that arose between the states. The Philadelphia Convention set out to correct weaknesses of the Articles that had been apparent even before the American Revolutionary War had been successfully concluded.|$|E
5|$|In the 1880s, Alfred Comyn Lyall, an {{administrator}} of the British Raj who also studied history, revisited Tod's classification and asserted that the Rajput society was in fact tribal, based on kinship rather than feudal vassalage. He had previously generally agreed with Tod, who acknowledged claims that blood-ties played some sort of role {{in the relationship between}} princes and vassals in many states. In shifting the emphasis from a feudal to a tribal basis, Lyall was able to deny the possibility that the Rajput kingdoms might gain sovereignty. If Rajput society was not feudal, then it was not on the same trajectory that European nations had followed, thereby forestalling any need to consider that they might evolve into <b>sovereign</b> <b>states.</b> There was thus no need for Britain to consider itself to be illegitimately governing them.|$|E
50|$|Antioquia {{became a}} <b>sovereign</b> <b>state</b> in 1858, by {{recognition}} as Estado de la Federación {{in the constitution}} of the Granadine Confederation. Antioquia issued its first postage stamps on September 1 1868. A postal exchange agreement with the <b>sovereign</b> <b>state</b> of Bolívar was established a few years later. With the Constitution of 1886, the <b>sovereign</b> <b>state</b> became a department, along with all the other states of Colombia, butthey continued with their postal services and stamps until 1906, when the national government took over all the services previously performed by the departments.|$|R

5|$|The Convention {{agreed on}} several principles. Most importantly, {{they agreed that}} the Convention should go beyond its mandate merely to amend the Articles of Confederation, and instead should produce a new {{constitution}} outright. While some delegates thought this illegal, the Articles of Confederation were closer to a treaty between <b>sovereign</b> <b>states</b> than they were to a national constitution, so the genuine legal problems were limited. Another principle they agreed on was that the new government would have all {{the powers of the}} Confederation Congress, plus additional powers over the states. Once agreeing on these principles, the Convention voted on the Virginia plan and signaled their approval for it. Once this was done, they began modifying it.|$|E
5|$|George VI's reign saw the {{acceleration}} of {{the dissolution of the}} British Empire. The Statute of Westminster 1931 had already acknowledged the evolution of the Dominions into separate <b>sovereign</b> <b>states.</b> The process of transformation from an empire to a voluntary association of independent states, known as the Commonwealth, gathered pace after the Second World War. During the ministry of Clement Attlee, British India became the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan in 1947. George relinquished the title of Emperor of India, and became King of India and King of Pakistan instead. In 1950 he ceased to be King of India when it became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations and recognised his new title of Head of the Commonwealth; he remained King of Pakistan until his death. Other countries left the Commonwealth, such as Burma in January 1948, Palestine (divided between Israel and the Arab states) in May 1948 and the Republic of Ireland in 1949.|$|E
5|$|The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is an {{international}} financial institution that offers loans to middle-income developing countries. The IBRD {{is the first of}} five member institutions that compose the World Bank Group and is headquartered in Washington, D.C., United States. It was established in 1944 with the mission of financing the reconstruction of European nations devastated by World War II. The IBRD and its concessional lending arm, the International Development Association, are collectively known as the World Bank as they share the same leadership and staff. Following the reconstruction of Europe, the Bank's mandate expanded to advancing worldwide economic development and eradicating poverty. The IBRD provides commercial-grade or concessional financing to <b>sovereign</b> <b>states</b> to fund projects that seek to improve transportation and infrastructure, education, domestic policy, environmental consciousness, energy investments, healthcare, access to food and potable water, and access to improved sanitation.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the first}} billion years of Earth's history, life {{appeared}} in the oceans and began to affect the Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as much as 4.1 billion years ago. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties, and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. In {{the history of the}} Earth, biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinction events. Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct. Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary widely; most species have not been described. Over 7.4 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival. Humans have developed diverse societies and cultures; politically, the world has about 200 <b>sovereign</b> <b>states.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following {{the fall}} of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna (convened in 1814) founded the German Confederation (Deutscher Bund), a loose league of 39 <b>sovereign</b> <b>states.</b> The {{appointment}} of the Emperor of Austria as the permanent president of the Confederation reflected the Congress's failure to accept Prussia's influence among the German states, and acerbated the long-standing competition between the Hohenzollern and Habsburg interests. Disagreement within restoration politics partly led {{to the rise of}} liberal movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman Metternich. The Zollverein, a tariff union, furthered economic unity in the German states. National and liberal ideals of the French Revolution gained increasing support among many, especially young, Germans. The Hambach Festival in May 1832 was a main event in support of German unity, freedom and democracy. In the light of a series of revolutionary movements in Europe, which established a republic in France, intellectuals and commoners started the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states. King Frederick William IV of Prussia was offered the title of Emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, leading to a temporary setback for the movement.|$|E
5|$|On 25 April 1991, the Croatian Parliament {{decided to}} hold an {{independence}} referendum on 19 May. The decision {{was published in the}} official gazette of the Republic of Croatia and made official on 2 May 1991. The referendum offered two options. In the first, Croatia would become a sovereign and independent state, guaranteeing cultural autonomy and civil rights to Serbs and other minorities in Croatia, free to form an association of <b>sovereign</b> <b>states</b> with other former Yugoslav republics. In the second, Croatia would remain in Yugoslavia as a unified federal state. Serb local authorities called for a boycott of the vote, which was largely followed by Croatian Serbs. The referendum was held at 7,691 polling stations, where voters were given two ballots—blue and red, with a single referendum option each, allowing use of either or both of ballots. The referendum question proposing independence of Croatia, presented on the blue ballot, passed with 93.24% in favor, 4.15% against, and 1.18% of invalid or blank votes. The second referendum question, proposing that Croatia should remain in Yugoslavia, was declined with 5.38% votes in favor, 92.18% against and 2.07% of invalid votes. The turnout was 83.56%.|$|E
