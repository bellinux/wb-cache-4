The importance of this study is manifested in numerous applications such as oil and gas transportation where dynamic loading can be the result of an accident. The classical Bernoulli-Euler beam theory is adopted to describe the dynamic behaviour of an elastic pipe and a new governing equation of a long pipe transporting gas or liquid is derived. This governing equation incorporates the effects of inertia, centrifugal and Coriolis forces due to the flowing medium. This equation can be normalised to demonstrate that only two non-dimensional parameters govern the static and dynamic response of the system incorporating a pipe and flowing medium. The transient response of this system is investigated based on a standard perturbation approach. Further, a numerical method utilising the finite difference method is developed and applied to investigate the dynamic response of a simply <b>supported</b> <b>pipe.</b> It is demonstrated that the previous dynamic models which largely ignore the internal flow effects and interactions between the flow and structure normally produce a large error and are inapplicable to the analysis of many practical situations. One interesting effect identified in the numerical study is that at certain flow ratio the system becomes dynamically unstable and any, even very small, external perturbation leads to a growing unstable dynamic behaviour.

It is assumed that the mass-flow rate is prescribed and constant and the pipe cross section is piecewise uniform. An existing beam element capable of handling large motions is modified to include {{the effect of the}} fluid flow and the initial curvature of the pipe. The modified element is incorporated in a finite-element based multibody system dynamics program, which takes care of the connection with other parts of the system and the simulation. The element is applied in several test problems: the buckling of a simply <b>supported</b> <b>pipe,</b> the flutter instability of a cantilever pipe, and the motion of a curved pipe that can rotate about an axis perpendicular to its plane.

40|$|It {{is known}} to all, the {{spilling}} of pipeline may cause serious problems, especially when the pipe conveying petroleum, natural gas or other toxic substance. There are countless accidents during past century. Once the spilling occurs, the vibration of the pipe would aggravate spill situation and even result in crack of the pipe. The consequence will be more severe when the fluid inside is compressible. To prevent {{the detriment of the}} spilling model is developed by assuming the leakages as orifices or nozzles and a 2 -D vertical simply <b>supported</b> <b>pipe</b> is selected to analyze the phenomena of the oscillation. Combining these two models, the oscillation model for the pipe with leakage is set up and the spilling effect is analyzed by numerical method.

The lateral vibration model of nanotube conveying steady flow is derived {{based on the}} Timoshenko beam theory. The control partial differential equations are dealt with Fourier transform and the wave form solutions are obtained. The wave propagation matrix and reflection matrices at different boundary conditions are gained. By using the wave train closure principle, the wave characteristic equation for natural frequency computation of nanotube conveying fluid is established. In the example, the natural frequencies of simply <b>supported</b> <b>pipe</b> conveying fluid and the critical velocity of simply supported nanotube conveying fluid are computed and the results show great agreement with that in existing literature.

The importance of this study is manifested in numerous applications, such as oil and gas transportations, where dynamic loading can be the result of an accident. The classical Bernoulli-Euler beam theory was adopted to describe the dynamic behavior of an elastic pipe and a new governing equation of a long pipe transporting gas or liquid was derived. This governing equation incorporated the effects of inertia, centrifugal, and Coriolis forces due to the flowing water. This equation can be normalized to demonstrate that only two non-dimensional parameters governed the static and the dynamic responses of the system incorporating a pipe and flowing water. The transient response of this system was investigated based on a standard perturbation approach. Moreover, it had been demonstrated that the previous dynamic models, which largely ignored the internal flow effects and interactions between the flow and the structure, normally produced a large error and are inapplicable to the analysis of many practical situations.

40|$|Water hammer {{represents}} a complex hydraulic phenomenon with significant consequences {{on the proper}} functioning and safety of operation for pipe and conduit systems. The complexity and intricate physics of water hammer translated into significant difficulties associated firstly, with finding a proper solution for understanding the mechanism of its occurrence and, secondly, relating to proposing technically and economically viable design methods and devices that would help reduce and mitigate water hammer effects. In this context, the present thesis deals with the numerical modeling of the transient behaviour of water pipe segments. Following an extensive literature review of the state-of-the-art on the water hammer mechanisms and past work on experimental, analytical and numerical analysis of this phenomenon, a three dimensional numerical model of the water hammer in a pipe which considers the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) is developed using a Finite Element Method – Finite Volume Method (FEM-FVM) technique. Structural and fluid computational results based on rapid and slow gate closure scenarios are compared with existing closed-form solutions of the water hammer. A parametric study is also performed on a simply <b>supported</b> <b>pipe</b> segment to {{determine the influence of}} various design parameter. A systematic sensitivity analysis was conducted and a ranking mechanism was established for the importance of each parameter on the fluid fields and structural response. A first comparative analysis is conducted on horizontally and vertically bent elevated pipe segments to quantify the influence of the bend angle on the results. A second comparative analysis is performed on a horizontally bent segment buried in soil to determine the influence of the pipe interaction with the soil on the response. It is observed that the thickness, span, initial velocity and bend angle {{had a significant impact on}} the pressure and structural response. The presence of soil was observed to have a significant benefit in decreasing the von-Mises stresses...|$|E
40|$|The primary aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the effects of a flowing medium on the transient response for different types of pipes subjected to dynamically applied loading. The types of support include a cantilever pipe, encastre pipe, propped cantilever pipe, and simply <b>supported</b> <b>pipe.</b> The topic is very important in many industrial and military applications including offshore structures, oil and gas, power stations, petrochemical and defence industries where critical pipe components transporting a gas or liquid can be subjected to impact loading due to an accident. In many previous studies, such effects were largely ignored, simplified or considered negligible. The conducted study demonstrated that in many practically important cases, the influence of flowing medium on transient response is not small and has to be taken into consideration. The classical Bernoulli-Euler beam theory is adopted to describe the dynamic behaviour of an elastic pipe and a new governing equation of a long pipe transporting gas or liquid is derived. This governing equation incorporates the effects of inertia, centrifugal and Coriolis forces due to the flowing medium. This equation can be normalised to demonstrate that only two non-dimensional parameters govern the static and dynamic response of the system incorporating a pipe and flowing medium. The transient response of this system is investigated based on a standard perturbation approach. Further, a numerical method utilising the finite difference method is developed and applied to investigate the dynamic response of pipes with different support. It is demonstrated that the previous dynamic models which largely ignore the internal flow effects and interactions between the flow and structure normally produce a large error and are inapplicable to the analysis of many practical situations.
