40|$|Now forging parts {{papermaking}} machines uses {{many different}} designs presses. Regardless {{of the type}} of construction, the water is filtered through paper to canvas cloth in the transverse direction, filtering water from the cloth can occur in the longitudinal direction (simple presses) or in the transverse direction (shaft with blind holes, grooved shaft, <b>suction</b> <b>shaft).</b> Presses of the native papermaking machines provide a dry cloth when pressed, about 35 ? 40 %. That is not enough, as for drying the paper spent a huge amount of thermal energy in the form of steam, so the development of the press, providing a significant increase in dry is relevant. One way of increasing dryness is usage of shoe press, which by increasing the length of the contact area increased while pressing, so dry cloth before drying section increasing to 50 ? 55 %. Work of presses of papermaking machine is measured by the amount of water removed, and uniform moisture content across the width of fabric after the presses. Dehydration capacity of presses depends primarily on the length of the extrusion zone delighted shaft and on the number of these zones. When pressing simultaneously with dehydration of the paper web changing its structure, increases the contact area between the fibers and the coupling strength between them. In the existing literature does not sufficiently covered shoe-type presses calculation that does not allow constructing them because kinetic regularities of the process is unknown. The {{purpose of this article is}} to establish the kinetics of the compaction and main parameters shoe-type press needed to develop methods of calculation and design shoe presses. In the conventional two-shaft presses created considerable common pressure gradient and significantly lower hydraulic pressure gradient. In the developed design will increase the hydraulic pressure gradient by summing the camera of the shoe-type heated compressed air. Under the influence of the total pressure break down the cell structure of the paper web from which water is removed that the action of hydraulic pressure filtered in cloth, from cloth in the grooves of the shaft.

40|$|Liquid ring pump {{is widely}} applied in many {{industry}} fields {{due to the}} advantages of isothermal compression process, simple structure, and liquid-sealing. Based on the actual operating cycle of “suction-compression-discharge-expansion,” a universal theoretical model for performance of liquid ring pump was established in this study, {{to solve the problem}} that the theoretical models deviated from the actual performance in operating cycle. With the major geometric parameters and operating conditions of a liquid ring pump, the performance parameters such as the actual capacity for <b>suction</b> and discharge, <b>shaft</b> power, and global efficiency can be conveniently predicted by the proposed theoretical model, without the limitation of empiric range, performance data, or the detailed 3 D geometry of pumps. The proposed theoretical model was verified by experimental performances of liquid ring pumps and could provide a feasible tool for the application of liquid ring pump...|$|R
40|$|Nitrate (NO₃⁻) {{leaching}} from agriculture {{has become}} an increasigly important issue in New Zealand. There {{has been an increase}} in NO₃⁻ leaching in recent years, with the cause of this mainly due to increases in cattle numbers and the application of N fertilisers. NO₃⁻ leaching is of importance due to its economic cost to farmers, environmental impact and potential health risk. Economic cost to the farmers occurs when leached nitrogen (N) has to be replaced with fertiliser N. There is also a major environmental concern about eutrophication. Eutrophication causes an increase in algae and aquatic life and reduces the recreational value of waterways. Winter forage grazing systems leach disproportitally high amounts of N, compared {{with the rest of the}} farming system. There are very few measurements of nitrate leaching losses from below winter grazed fodder beet (FB) in New Zealand. Measurements are needed urgently to quantify and ultimately minimise NO₃⁻ losses from these systems. The current systems of measuring NO₃⁻ leaching suffer from limitations such as being labour intensive, the inability to measure nitrate leaching under cultivation and the need to scale up results from small plots or lysimeters. The objective of this research project was to develop a new system of measuring N leaching that could accurately quantify N leaching under a winter grazed FB crop without the limitations of current systems. The suction cup and lysimeter array (SCALAR) system was developed to overcome these limitations. This was done through having a single collection/retrieval site, changing the depth of the top of the <b>suction</b> cup <b>shaft</b> to below the level of cultivation in soil, increasing the number of suction cups per unit area and having a large measurement area (0. 16 ha). The SCALAR system was developed and tested in this research project. The results showed that the SCALAR system successfully overcome the limitations of previous measurement systems. The results of this study showed the total N leaching under the winter grazed FB crop was 106. 9 kg N/ha. Of this, 101. 5 kg N/ha was leached in the form of NO₃⁻ and 5. 4 kg N/ha was leached in the form of ammonium (NH₄⁺). However, these values are likely to have been affected by the development and testing of the SCALAR system and are therefore not considered to be representative of a typical winter grazed FB crop. Future research is still needed to quantify N leaching losses under a winter grazed FB crop using the SCALAR system that has been developed in this project. The SCALAR system will potentially remain in the ground for 20 - 30 years, allowing it to be used in future research to quantify N leaching under a variety of farming systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} pile {{foundations}} in conventional geotechnical engineering practice {{is based on}} the soil mechanics principles for saturated soils. These approaches are also extended to pile foundations that are placed totally or partially above the ground water table (i. e., vadose zone), where the soil is typically in a state of unsaturated condition. Such approaches lead to unrealistic estimations of the load carrying capacity and the settlement behavior of pile foundations. Some studies were undertaken in recent years to understand the influence of the matric suction towards the bearing capacity of model pile foundations placed in unsaturated fine-grained and coarse-grained soils. The conventional   and methods were modified to interpret the contribution of shaft carrying capacity of single piles in fine-grained soils (e. g., Vanapalli and Taylan 2011, Vanapalli and Taylan 2012). Also, the conventional method has been used to understand the contribution of matric <b>suction</b> towards the <b>shaft</b> resistance in unsaturated sands (Vanapalli et al. 2010). One of the key objectives of the present research study is directed to determine the contribution of matric suction towards the bearing capacity and settlement behavior of model single pile foundations in unsaturated sands. A series of single model pile load tests were performed in a laboratory environment to study the contribution of the matric suction towards the total, shaft, and base bearing capacity of the model piles with three different diameters (i. e., 38. 30, 31. 75, and 19. 25 mm) in two unsaturated sands (i. e., a clean commercial sand and a super fine sand). Hanging column method (i. e., plexi glass water container) was used to control the matric suction values in the compacted sands in the test tank by varying the water table. The results of the testing programs indicate the significant contribution of the matric suction towards the bearing capacity of single model piles (i. e., 2 to 2. 5 times of base bearing capacity and 5 times of shaft bearing capacity under unsaturated conditions in comparison with saturated condition). The test results were interpreted successfully by modifying the conventional methods for estimating the pile shaft bearing capacity (i. e., β method) and base bearing capacity (i. e., Terzaghi 1943, Hansen 1970 and Janbu 1976). In addition, semi-empirical methods were proposed for predicting the bearing capacity of single model piles using the effective shear strength parameters (i. e., c' and ϕ') and the soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC). There is a good agreement between the measured and the predicted bearing capacity of single model piles using the semi-empirical models proposed in this study. In addition, numerical investigations were undertaken using the commercial finite element analysis program SIGMA/W (Geostudio 2007) to simulate the load-displacement (i. e., p-δ) behavior of the single model piles for the two sands (i. e., clean commercial sand and super fine sand) under saturated and unsaturated conditions. An elastic-perfectly plastic Mohr-Coulomb model that takes into account the influence of the matric suction was used to simulate the load-displacement (i. e., p-δ) behavior. The numerical approach proposed in this thesis is simple and only requires the information of the effective shear strength parameters (i. e., c' and ϕ'), the elastic modulus (i. e., Esat) under saturated conditions, the soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC), and the distribution of the matric suction with respect to depth. The approaches proposed in this thesis can be extended to determine the in-situ load carrying capacity of single piles and also simulate the load-displacement (i. e., p-δ) behavior. The studies presented in this thesis are promising and encouraging to study their validity in-situ conditions. Such studies will be valuable to implement the mechanics of unsaturated soils into geotechnical engineering practice...|$|R
