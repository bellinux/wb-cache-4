500|$|Murray {{designed}} a version {{driven by a}} complex series of clutches running from the engine to a large single fan {{at the back of}} the car. Therefore, the faster the engine ran, the stronger the <b>suction</b> <b>effect.</b> Like the Lotus, it had sliding [...] "skirts" [...] that sealed the gap between the sides of the cars and the ground. These prevented excessive air from being sucked into the low pressure area under the car and dissipating the ground effect. There was a rule banning [...] "moveable aerodynamic devices", but the fan also drew air through a horizontally mounted radiator over the engine. Using a fan to assist cooling was legal—Brabham had used a small electric fan to this effect on the BT45Cs at the South American races at the start of the year—and Brabham claimed that this was the primary effect of the new device. These claims were lent some legitimacy by the cooling system design issues that had affected the original design at the start of the year.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: During the {{six years}} long Pasachalk project devoted to the {{mechanical}} behaviour of high porosity chalks from North Sea oilfields, the constitutive model Pasachalk (Collin et al., 2002) was proposed based on the Barcelona Basic Model (BBM) (Alonso et al., 1990). The approach {{was based on the}} similarities found between the oil-water interactions (oil and water being the non wetting and wetting fluid respectively) in oil reservoir chalk and the air-water interactions in unsaturated soils. This approach appeared to be relevant to interpret the subsidence of the seafloor during waterflooding operations for enhanced oil recovery that has been observed in North Sea oilfields (e. g. Ekofisk oilfield). Another important component of subsidence was then related to the creep behaviour of the multiphase chalk (De Gennaro et al., 2003). A modified Pasachalk model was proposed to account for time effects using the framework of Perzyna’s viscoplasticity (1964) but without considering <b>suction</b> <b>effects.</b> Based on available experimental results (Priol et al., 2007), {{a modified version of the}} viscoplastic Pasachalk model including <b>suction</b> <b>effects</b> is proposed in this paper. ...|$|R

The length of time for which the <b>suction</b> <b>effect</b> can be maintained depends mainly on how long it takes for air or water to leak back into the cavity between the cup and the surface, equalizing the pressure with the surrounding atmosphere.

50|$|At {{high angle}} of attack, with the fan off, the airfoil fully stalls, {{and a large}} wake is present. However, when the fan is turned on, the <b>suction</b> <b>effect</b> of the fan draws the air in, {{completely}} eliminating the wake. The result is {{a significant increase in}} lift. In addition to maintaining flight at very high angles of attack, lift and drag forces can be managed through circulation control. In particular, if the exhaust is deflected downward as it leaves the propulsor, a circulation control effect is realized. Even at low angle of attack, high lift coefficients have been shown with CFD and validated with wind tunnel experiments.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an unconventional}} constitutive model for soils, {{which deals with}} a unified thermo-mechanical modelling for unsaturated soils. The relevant temperature and <b>suction</b> <b>effects</b> are studied in light of elasto-plasticity. A generalized effective stress framework is adopted, which includes a number of intrinsic thermo-hydro-mechanical connections, to represent the stress state in the soil. Two coupled constitutive aspects are used to fully describe the non-isothermal behaviour. The mechanical constitutive part is built on the concepts of bounding surface theory and multi-mechanism plasticity, whereas water retention characteristics are described using elasto-plasticity to reproduce the hysteretic response {{and the effect of}} temperature and dry density on retention properties.

Since the pore size distribution curves before and after loading appeared to be comparable {{in the range of}} pore sizes covered by mercury intrusion (entrance diameter between 363. 6 µm and 5. 5 nm), it was concluded, based onmicrostructure considerations, that swelling occurred in pores with diameter smaller than 5. 5 nm, from a water transfer within the clay matrix from inter-platelets to intra-platelets pores. This mechanism might occur when excavating galleries in areas of the Excavation damaged zone that support instantaneous unloading sequences, as a first desaturation process prior to subsequent evaporation due to the ventilation of galleries...|$|R
