5000|$|A device-independent <b>SNA</b> <b>protocol,</b> it is {{used for}} {{peer-to-peer}} communications between two systems, for example, between a computer and a device (e.g. terminal or printer), or between computers. LU6.2 is used by many of IBM's products, including Common Programming Interface for Communications Intersystem Communications (CICS ISC), and Information Management System.|$|E
50|$|Most {{terminals}} {{were connected}} to minicomputers or mainframe computers and often had a green or amber screen. Typically terminals communicate with the computer via a serial port via a null modem cable, often using an EIA RS-232 or RS-422 or RS-423 or a current loop serial interface. IBM systems communicated over a coaxial cable using IBM's <b>SNA</b> <b>protocol,</b> but for many DEC, Data General and NCR (and so on) computers there were many visual display suppliers competing against the computer manufacturer for terminals to expand the systems. In fact, the instruction design for the Intel 8008 was originally conceived at Computer Terminal Corporation as the processor for the Datapoint 2200.|$|E
5000|$|The IBM 3279 was IBM's first colour Terminal. It was {{introduced}} in 1979. The 3279 was widely used as an IBM mainframe terminal before PCs became commonly used for the purpose. It {{was part of the}} 3270 series, using the 3270 datastream. [...] Terminals could be connected to a 3274 controller, either channel connected to an IBM mainframe or linked via an SDLC (Synchronous Data Link Control) link. In the Systems Network Architecture (<b>SNA)</b> <b>protocol</b> these terminals were logical unit type 2 (LU2). The basic model 2 used red, green for input fields, and blue and white for output fields. However, there were other models with seven colours and different screen sizes, and one kind had a loadable character set {{that could be used to}} show graphics.|$|E
5000|$|Data-Link Switching (DLSw) (Systems Network Architecture (<b>SNA)</b> {{tunneling}} <b>protocol)</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|... {{with the}} {{popularity}} {{and growth of}} TCP/IP, SNA is changing from being a true network architecture to being what could be termed an [...] "application and application access architecture." [...] In other words, there are many applications that still need to communicate in SNA, but the required <b>SNA</b> <b>protocols</b> are carried over the network by IP.|$|R
50|$|Connection to non-SNA {{networks}} was difficult. An application which needed {{access to}} some communication scheme, which was not supported in {{the current version of}} SNA, faced obstacles. Before IBM included X.25 support (NPSI) in SNA, connecting to an X.25 network would have been awkward. Conversion between X.25 and <b>SNA</b> <b>protocols</b> could have been provided either by NCP software modifications or by an external protocol converter.|$|R
5000|$|IBM Network Control Program (NCP) is a {{communications}} program {{running on the}} 3705 and subsequent 37xx communications processors that, among other things, implements the packet switching <b>protocol</b> defined by <b>SNA.</b> The <b>protocol</b> performed two main functions: ...|$|R
50|$|As {{was typical}} for ATM {{hardware}} of this era, the IBM 3624 had a two distinct high-level communications protocols. The first, a direct mainframe attachment through SDLC links was an IBM <b>SNA</b> LU0 <b>protocol.</b> The second was an {{attachment to the}} IBM 3600 and 4700 series of banking equipment, and was a start stop TDM loop with time slots assigned to specific 36xx series equipment at 1200 bit/sec.|$|R
25|$|IBM, AT and DEC {{were the}} first major {{corporations}} to adopt TCP/IP, despite having competing internal <b>protocols</b> (<b>SNA,</b> XNS, DECNET). In IBM, from 1984, Barry Appelman's group did TCP/IP development. (Appelman later moved to AOL {{to be the head}} of all its development efforts.) They navigated the corporate politics to get a stream of TCP/IP products for various IBM systems, including MVS, VM, and OS/2. At the same time, several smaller companies began offering TCP/IP stacks for DOS and MS Windows, such as the company FTP Software, and the Wollongong Group. The first VM/CMS TCP/IP stack came from the University of Wisconsin.|$|R
5000|$|Genera also {{featured}} {{the most extensive}} networking interoperability software seen to that point. A local area network system called Chaosnet had been invented for the Lisp Machine (predating the commercial availability of Ethernet). The Symbolics system supported Chaosnet, but also {{had one of the}} first TCP/IP implementations. It also supported DECnet and IBM's <b>SNA</b> network <b>protocols.</b> A Dialnet protocol used phone lines and modems. Genera would, using hints from its distributed [...] "namespace" [...] database (somewhat similar to DNS, but more comprehensive, like parts of Xerox's Grapevine), automatically select the best protocol combination to use when connecting to network service. An application program (or a user command) would only specify the name of the host and the desired service. For example, a host name and a request for [...] "Terminal Connection" [...] might yield a connection over TCP/IP using the Telnet protocol (although there were many other possibilities). Likewise, requesting a file operation (such as a Copy File command) might pick NFS, FTP, NFILE (the Symbolics network file access protocol), or one of several others, and it might execute the request over TCP/IP, Chaosnet, or whatever other network was most suitable.|$|R
50|$|IBM {{does not}} market a direct {{hardware}} {{replacement for the}} IBM 3745 providing all of the 3745/3746 interfaces. However, IBM offers a software emulation product that provides a subset of 3745/3746 function, IBM's Communications Controller for Linux on System z. CCL is a software emulation that runs on the mainframe under Linux on System z. The NCP (Network Control Program) licensed {{for use in the}} 3745/3746 continues to be licensed for use with CCL. CCL employs the IBM OSA adapter for physical connectivity. Low and medium speed lines must be supported through router ports. Alternatively, in many cases it is possible to migrate away from networking protocols supported by the 3745 and CCL, relying solely on the <b>SNA</b> and TCP/IP <b>protocol</b> support provided by z/OS Communications Server.|$|R
50|$|IBM had an innovator's role in {{pervasive}} technologies that were less visible as well. In 1974, IBM announced Systems Network Architecture (<b>SNA),</b> a networking <b>protocol</b> for computing systems. SNA is a uniform {{set of rules}} and procedures for computer communications to free computer users from the technical complexities of communicating through local, national, and international computer networks. SNA became {{the most widely used}} system for data processing until more open architecture standards were approved in the 1990s. In 1975, IBM researcher Benoit Mandelbrot conceived fractal geometry—a new geometrical concept that made it possible to describe mathematically the kinds of irregularities existing in nature. Fractals had a great impact on engineering, economics, metallurgy, art and health sciences, and are integral to the field of computer graphics and animation.|$|R
5000|$|... 1970: Relational databasesIBM {{introduces}} relational databases which {{call for}} information stored within {{a computer to}} be arranged in easy-to-interpret tables to access and manage large amounts of data. Today, nearly all database structures {{are based on the}} IBM concept of relational databases.1970: Office copiersIBM introduces its first of three models of xerographic copiers. These machines mark the first commercial use of organic photoconductors which since grew to become the dominant technology. 1971: Speech recognitionIBM achieves its first operational application of speech recognition, which enables engineers servicing equipment to talk to and receive spoken answers from a computer that can recognize about 5,000 words. Today, IBM's ViaVoice recognition technology has a vocabulary of 64,000 words and a 260,000-word back-up dictionary.1971: Floppy diskIBM introduces the floppy disk. Convenient and highly portable, the floppy becomes a personal computer industry standard for storing data.1973: Winchester storage technologyThe IBM 3340 disk unit—known as [...] "Winchester" [...] after IBM's internal project name—is introduced, an advanced technology which more than doubled the information density on disk surfaces. It featured a smaller, lighter read/write head that was designed to ride on an air film only 18 millionths of an inch thick. Winchester technology was adopted by the industry and used for the next two decades.1973: Nobel PrizeDr. Leo Esaki, an IBM Fellow who joined the company in 1960, shares the 1973 Nobel Prize in physics for his 1958 discovery of the phenomenon of electron tunneling. His discovery of the semiconductor junction called the Esaki diode finds wide use in electronics applications. More importantly, his work in the field of semiconductors lays a foundation for further exploration in the electronic transport of solids.1974: SNAIBM announces Systems Network Architecture (<b>SNA),</b> a networking <b>protocol</b> for computing systems. SNA is a uniform set of rules and procedures for computer communications to free computer users from the technical complexities of communicating through local, national, and international computer networks. SNA becomes the most widely used system for data processing until more open architecture standards were approved in the 1990s.|$|R
