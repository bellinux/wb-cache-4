40|$|SUMMARY During a 1 -year period 398 new {{patients}} were seen with disciform <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> (530 eyes). The lesions were studied retrospectively, {{and those in}} which the neovascular tissue did not underlie the fovea, and therefore were treatable, were identified. The following conclusions were drawn: (1) Treatment is possible in most patients with good acuity and few with poor acuity. (2) Treatment is possible in {{a large proportion of}} patients with a short history and few with a long history of visual loss. (3) As many as 500 % of all patients with <b>senile</b> disciform <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> may be amenable to treatment if seen early enough {{in the course of their}} disease. (4) Over one-third of eyes with lesions that are untreated have a visual acuity of 6 / 60 or better 3 years after the onset of symptoms. (5) If a controlled trial proves that treatment is beneficial, these results emphasise the need for rapid referral and show that these patients will generate a large additional clinical load. The early reports of photocoagulation in <b>senile</b> disciform <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> showed poor visual results after treatment (Zweng et al., 1968; Schneider, 1970; l'Esperance, 1971). With a better understand-ing of the disease process (Gass, 1967; Teeters and Bird, 1973 a,b) a more rational approach to photo-coagulation has evolved.

40|$|AIM: To explore {{curative}} {{effect of}} different drugs in treatment of <b>senile</b> wet <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> METHODS: We selected 98 patients 98 eyes with <b>senile</b> wet <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> from July 2014 to January 2016 in our hospital as the research subjects. They {{were divided into}} control group and research group as the administration sequence, 49 patients in each group. Research group was treated with ranibizumab. The control group was treated with Conbercept. Both once per month and for 3 mo. RESULTS: Uncorrected visual acuity, central macular retinal thickness and area of choroidal neovascularization(CNV) leakage before treatment {{of the two groups}} were not statistically different(P > 0. 05). At 1, 3 and 6 mo after treatment, the uncorrected visual acuity was improved significantly, the central macular retinal thickness decreased significantly, and the area of CNV leakage decreased significantly(P P P > 0. 05). In the follow up period, there was no severe complications in the two groups, such as persistent high intraocular pressure, retinal detachment or tear, endophthalmitis, or other systemic complications. There were subconjunctival hemorrhage in 10 eyes in research group, 8 eyes in control group, all of which recovered within 15 d after treatment. Transient elevated intraocular pressure occurred in 7 eyes in research group, in 9 eyes in control group. The complication rates of the two groups were not significant(P > 0. 05).

40|$|<b>Senile</b> disciform <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> is {{classified}} into two groups: the pigment epithelial detachment (PED) {{group and the}} non-pigment epithelial detachment group. It {{is not clear whether}} choroidal neovascularization occurs in the PED group, although {{it has been shown that}} choroidal neovascularization takes place in the latter group. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the relationship between PED and choroidal neovascularization, visual prognosis, and the probability of photocoagulation for PED in <b>senile</b> disciform <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> Our retrospective study consists of 29 consecutive untreated patients (30 eyes) over 50 years of age all having PEDs except for one patient. The results are as follows: 1. Detachment was defined as serous (S-PED) in 9 eyes, combined (C-PED) in 12 eyes, and hemorrhagic (H-PED) in 9 eyes. 2. Detachment larger than 5 disc diameters was discovered in 1 of the 9 eyes (11. 1 %) in S-PED, none in the 12 eyes (0 %) in C-PED, and 3 of the 9 eyes (33. 3 %) in H-PED. 3. Incidence of the notch sign was observed in 56 % of S-PED, 67 % in C-PED, and 89 % in H-PED. In proportion to the extent of hemorrhage in the PED, incidence of the notch sign was increased. Abnormal hyperfluorescence was detected quite close to PED in all the patients under fluorescein angiography. 4. We classified the abnormal hyperfluorescence including the notch sign into three types based on the angiograms: patch-, tuft-, and reticular. These types were nearly always found to have subpigment epithelial neovascularization. The shape was different from those of pigment epithelial detachment (PED), and early irregular filling and late slight leakage of the dye were different from those of pigment epithelial detachment (PED) and atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). 5. Prognosis for visual acuity was rather good. However, it is highly possible that we can directly treat choroidal neovascularization in a notch, which is not covered with subpigment epithelial blood, before neovascular membrane reaches the center of the foveal avascular zone.

40|$|Clinical and {{pathological}} examination {{was performed on}} 378 eyes from 216 patients aged 43 to 97 years. This series represented eyes in which the fundi were normal or showed various manifestations of <b>senile</b> <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> The eyes were divided into six groups according to the histological appearance of a linear deposit {{at the base of}} the retinal pigment cells. Groups I and II were considered to represent normal ageing, Groups III and IV the progressive development of <b>senile</b> <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> and Groups V and VI the end-results. Group I showed no basal linear deposit. Thickening and hyalinization of Bruch's membrane was noted as early as the fifth decade. Group II showed patchy development of the basal linear deposit in relation to thickened or basophilic segments of Bruch's membrane, or over intercapillary hyalinization extending to the level of the outer surface of the choriocapillaris. Almost all eyes in these two groups retained a normal fundus appearance but visual acuity declined with age even in the absence of other causes. In Group III the basal deposit formed a thin continuous layer associated with moderate degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium. More than half the eyes had developed a clinical disturbance of pigmentation and in most vision was reduced. Group IV was characterized by thickening of the deposit and more pronounced disturbance of the pigment epithelium. Clinically most eyes showed coarse pigmentary changes and vision was in the order of 6 / 24. 14 - 3 per cent of eyes in this group showed early neovascularization from the choroid. In Group V the pigment epithelium disappeared to produce circumscribed areas of depigmentation. The basal linear deposit could be traced throughout the depigmented area in most eyes. Thin fibrovascular sheets were found beneath the pigment epithelium in 41 - 7 per cent of eyes. Group VI represented disciform degeneration. The basal linear deposit could often be demonstrated as a disrupted hyalinized layer incorporated into the scar. Disciform degeneration was an alternative end-result to geographical atrophy. In each group the clinical and histological findings may be modified by the presence of drusen or by atrophy of the choroid. The basal linear deposit consisted of banded fibres embedded in granular material lying between the plasma infoldings and the basement membrane of the retinal pigment epithelium. This deposit seems to be a manifestation of gradual failure of the pigment epithelium and proved to be the most suitable criterion by which to study the natural history of <b>senile</b> <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration...</b>|$|E

Visually threatening eye disease that requires urgent treatment or referral is important, despite its rarity. Early detection and treatment of amblyopia is important in children. In diabetic retinopathy, a potentially blinding disease, maculopathy and proliferative retinopathy require immediate referral. Chronic simple glaucoma and cataracts cause gradual loss of vision in the older adult. Sudden loss of vision can be caused by optic neuritis, which is occasionally the first sign of multiple sclerosis.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{determine}} whether poor fetal growth, {{as determined by}} size at birth, is associated with increased risk of age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> METHODS. A total of 660 men and women born in Sheffield, United Kingdom, between 1922 and 1930 and whose size at birth was available were traced and invited {{to take part in}} the study. Of these, 392 attended for ophthalmic examination. Age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> in these volunteers was determined by the Wisconsin Age-Related Maculopathy Grading System. RESULTS. The mean birth weight of subjects with <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> (early or late) was heavier than that of those without (7. 6 lb vs. 7. 3 lb, respectively; P = 0. 03). After adjustment for age, gender, and risk factors for <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration,</b> a significantly increased risk of <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> was found in subjects with higher birth weight (odds ratio [OR] 1. 5, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 1 – 2. 0 for each SD [1 lb, 5 oz] increase in birth weight). Other parameters describing size at birth showed a weaker relation or no relation with <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration,</b> but one of the measures of fetal proportion (head circumference-to-birth weight ratio) was significantly associated with risk of <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> Subjects with <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> had a significantly lower head circumference-to-birth weight ratio than did those without (11. 2 vs. 12. 0 respectively, P = 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS. The finding that age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> was associated with increased rather than decreased birth weight was unexpected. Failure of the developing fetus’s normal brain-sparing mechanism is a possible explanation for our finding of a lower head circumference-to-birth weight ratio among subjects with <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration.</b> <br/...|$|R

RESULTS: There were 175 cases and 175 controls {{with a mean age of}} 75. 4 years and 75. 5 years, respectively, of whom 236 (67. 4 %) were female. Of the cases with age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration,</b> 159 (45. 4 %) had age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> in their left eyes, 154 (44. 0 %) in their right eyes, and 138 (39. 4 %) in both eyes. Of the cases with age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> in their left eyes, 47. 8 % had the dry type, 40. 3 % had the wet type, and the type was unknown for 11. 9 %. The comparable figures for right eyes were: 51. 9 %, 34. 4 %, and 13. 7 %, respectively. The main effects model was dominated by higher sunlight exposure (OR [odds ratio]: 3. 3) and a family history of age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> (OR: 4. 3). Other factors included hypertension (OR: 2. 1), smoking (OR: 2. 2), and being of the Mestizo race, which lowered the risk of age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> (OR: 0. 40).

In this study, novel multifunctional silica-based magnetic nanoparticles (SMNPs) were strategically designed and prepared as targeting drug delivery system to achieve higher specificity and better solubility. 2, 7, 12, 18 -Tetramethyl- 3, 8 -di-(1 -propoxyethyl)- 13, 17 -bis-(3 -hydroxypropyl) porphyrin, shorted as PHPP, was used as photosensitizer, which was first synthesized by our lab with good PDT effects. Magnetite nanoparticles (Fe 3 O 4) and PHPP were incorporated into silica nanoparticles by microemulsion and sol–gel methods. The prepared nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. The nanoparticles were approximately spherical with 20 – 30 nm diameter. Intense fluorescence of PHPP was monitored in the cytoplasm of SW 480 cells. The nanoparticles possessed good biocompatibility and could generate singlet oxygen to cause remarkable photodynamic anti-tumor effects. These suggested that PHPP-SMNPs had great potential as effective drug delivery system in targeting photodynamic therapy, diagnostic magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic hyperthermia therapy.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY This paper {{describes}} bilateral {{tears of}} the {{retinal pigment epithelium}} (RPE) which followed photocoagulation treatment of retinal pigment epithelial detachment (PED) in the right eye and which occurred spontaneously in the left eye. A 66 -year-old Japanese male presented with PED approximately 4 x 6 disc diameters in size in his right eye, and one disc diameter in the left eye, both in the macular regions. The right PED was treated by placing a row of argon laser photocoagulation along {{the margin of the}} PED, with avoidance of the papillomacular bundle. Five days after treatment the PED enlarged peripherally beyond the coagulated site. Nineteen days later an RPE tear developed at the temporal edge of the detachment in the right eye. The remaining detached RPE retracted centrally, forming curled folds. About 40 days after the initial examination the patient complained of sudden reduction of vision in his left eye. At this time an enlargement of the PED was found in his left eye. One week after this examination a small RPE tear was found in the nasal border of the PED in the left eye.

In both 1981 and 1984 single-gene disorders accounted for 30 % of total blindness and congenital defects for another 10 - 11 %. Genetically determined conditions, diabetes, and <b>senile</b> <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> (SMD) were the three leading causes of registration in each year, 1980 - 4. We calculated mean ages of registration and mean ages of death {{over the last four}} years for five major aetiological groups. Patients with genetic conditions were registered at a much younger age and had a correspondingly longer duration of blindness (21 years as compared with 5 years for either diabetes or SMD). Total 'person-years of blindness' was then calculated from the product of this duration of blindness and the total numbers registered in each group. This index shows that the overall individual and population impact of monogenic blindness is overwhelmingly greater than that of other causes (6849 person-years compared with 270 for diabetes and 430 for SMD). In view of this frequency and duration of monogenic blindness, and also of the substantial hereditary liability to relatively common causes of blindness such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and high myopia, we suggest that more attention needs to be paid to elucidating the genetic contribution to blindness...|$|E

Design: Population-based cross-sectional study in an elderly Japanese-Brazilian population from Londrina (Paraná, Brazil). METHODS: The study included 483 (80. 5 %) of the 600 registered members of a local association for Japanese immigrants and their descendants, aged 60 years and up. The presence of early and late-stage age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> was determined using the standard protocol and the international classification system. RESULTS: The {{mean age of the}} study subjects was 71 years. The overall prevalence of age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> was 15. 1 % (CI 95 %; 12 - 18. 7). The prevalence of early-stage age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> was 13. 8 % (CI 95 %; 10. 9 - 17. 3), geographic atrophy was present in 0. 4 % and neovascular age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> in 0. 8 %. Age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> was significantly (p= 0. 004) and linearly (p= 0. 001) associated with age. CONCLUSION: Our study population displays a prevalence of early and late-stage age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> and component lesions similar to those of other Western countries, and data suggest a higher prevalence than that reported for populations in Japan. Since the age-related <b>macular</b> <b>degeneration</b> prevalence tends to rise as the population ages, studies identifying risk factors and exploring prevention methods are becoming increasingly important...|$|R
