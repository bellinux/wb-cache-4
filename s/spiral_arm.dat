5|$|A {{majority}} of spiral galaxies, including our own Milky Way galaxy, have a linear, bar-shaped band of stars that extends outward {{to either side}} of the core, then merges into the <b>spiral</b> <b>arm</b> structure. In the Hubble classification scheme, these are designated by an SB, followed by a lower-case letter (a, b or c) that indicates the form of the spiral arms (in the same manner as the categorization of normal spiral galaxies). Bars are thought to be temporary structures that can occur {{as a result of a}} density wave radiating outward from the core, or else due to a tidal interaction with another galaxy. Many barred spiral galaxies are active, possibly as a result of gas being channeled into the core along the arms.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, an overdensity {{of stars}} in the region was {{announced}} to be the Canis Major Dwarf, the closest satellite galaxy to Earth.

Investigation of the area yielded only ten RR Lyrae variables—consistent with the Milky Way's halo and thick disk populations rather than a separate dwarf spheroidal galaxy. On the other hand, a globular cluster in Puppis, NGC 2298—which appears {{to be part of the}} Canis Major dwarf system—is extremely metal-poor, suggesting it did not arise from the Milky Way's thick disk, and instead is of extragalactic origin.|$|E
5|$|Various {{morphological}} {{features of}} galaxies can affect {{their potential for}} habitability. Spiral arms, for example, are the location of star formation, but they contain numerous giant molecular clouds and a high density of stars that can perturb a star's Oort cloud, sending avalanches of comets and asteroids toward any planets further in. In addition, the high density of stars and rate of massive star formation can expose any stars orbiting within the spiral arms for too long to supernova explosions, reducing their prospects for the survival and development of life. Considering these factors, the Sun is advantageously placed within the galaxy because, {{in addition to being}} outside a <b>spiral</b> <b>arm,</b> it orbits near the corotation radius, maximizing the interval between spiral-arm crossings.|$|E
25|$|Gravitational {{perturbation}} {{of planets}} and planetesimals by nearby stars becomes less likely as {{the density of}} stars decreases.

40|$|In Paper I (Bae & Zhu 2017), we {{explained}} how a planet excites multiple <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> in a protoplanetary disk. To examine whether various characteristics of observed <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> {{can be used}} to constrain the masses of unseen planets and their positions within their disks, we carry out two-dimensional simulations varying planet mass and disk gas temperature. A larger number of <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> form with a smaller planet mass and a lower disk temperature. For a range of disk temperature characterized by the disk aspect ratio 0. 04 ≤ (h/r) _p ≤ 0. 15, three or fewer <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> are excited interior to a planet's orbit when M_p/M_* ≳ 3 × 10 ^- 4 and two <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> when M_p/M_* ≳ 3 × 10 ^- 3. Exterior to a planet's orbit, multiple <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> can form only in cold disks with (h/r) _p ≲ 0. 06. Constraining the planet mass with the pitch angle of <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> requires accurate disk temperature measurements that might be challenging even with ALMA. However, the property that the pitch angle of planet-driven <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> decreases away from the planet can be a powerful diagnostic to determine whether the planet is located interior or exterior to the observed spirals. The arm-to-arm separations increase as a function of planet mass, consistent with previous studies; however, we find that the exact slope depends on disk temperature as well as the radial location where the arm-to-arm separations are measured. We apply these diagnostics to the <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> seen in MWC 758 and Elias 2 - 27.

40|$|We study {{formation}} and long-term {{evolution of a}} circumstellar disk in a collapsing molecular cloud core using a resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulation. While the formed circumstellar disk is initially small, it grows as accretion continues and its radius becomes as large as 200 AUs {{toward the end of}} the Class-I phase. A pair of grand-design <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> form due to gravitational instability in the disk, and they transfer angular momentum in the highly resistive disk. Although the <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> disappear in a few rotations as expected in a classical theory, new <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> form recurrently as the disk soon becomes unstable again by gas accretion. Such recurrent <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> persist throughout the Class- 0 and I phase. We then perform synthetic observations and compare our model with a recent high-resolution observation of a young stellar object Elias 2 - 27, whose circumstellar disk has grand design <b>spiral</b> <b>arms.</b> We find good agreement between our theoretical model and the observation. Our model suggests that the grand design <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> around Elias 2 - 27 are consistent with material arms formed by gravitational instability. If such <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> commonly exist in young circumstellar disks, it implies that young circumstellar disks are considerably massive and gravitational instability is the key process of angular momentum transport.

25|$|A {{reason that}} our galaxy is {{considered}} rare by Rare Earth {{is because it}} appears to have suffered fewer collisions with other galaxies over the last 10 billion years, and its peaceful history may have made it more hospitable to complex life than galaxies which have suffered more collisions, and consequently more supernovae and other disturbances. The level of activity of the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way may also be important: {{too much or too little}} and the conditions for life may be even rarer. The Milky Way black hole appears to be just right. The orbit of the Sun around the center of the Milky Way is indeed almost perfectly circular, with a period of 226 Ma (1 Ma=1 million years), one closely matching the rotational period of the galaxy. However, the majority of stars in barred spiral galaxies populate the spiral arms rather than the halo and tend to move in gravitationally aligned orbits, so there is little that is unusual about the Sun's orbit. While the Rare Earth hypothesis predicts that the Sun should rarely, if ever, have passed through a <b>spiral</b> <b>arm</b> since its formation, astronomer Karen Masters has calculated that the orbit of the Sun takes it through a major <b>spiral</b> <b>arm</b> approximately every 100 million years.

25|$|Lenticular {{galaxies are}} {{unique in that}} they have a visible disk {{component}} as well as a prominent bulge component. They have much higher bulge-to-disk ratios than typical spirals and do not have the canonical <b>spiral</b> <b>arm</b> structure of late-type galaxies, yet may exhibit a central bar. This bulge dominance {{can be seen in the}} axis ratio (i.e. the ratio between the observed minor and major axial of a disk galaxy) distribution of a lenticular galaxy sample. The distribution for lenticular galaxies rises steadily in the range 0.25 to 0.85 whereas the distribution for spirals is essentially flat in that same range. Larger axial ratios can be explained by observing face-on disk galaxies or by having a sample of spheroidal (bulge-dominated) galaxies. Imagine looking at two disk galaxies edge-on, one with a bulge and one without a bulge. The galaxy with a prominent bulge will have a larger edge-on axial ratio compared to the galaxy without a bulge based on the definition of axial ratio. Thus a sample of disk galaxies with prominent spheroidal components will have more galaxies at larger axial ratios. The fact that the lenticular galaxy distribution rises with increasing observed axial ratio implies that lenticulars are dominated by a central bulge component.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Studying star {{formation}} in <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> tells {{us not only}} about the evolution of {{star formation}}, and molecular clouds, but can also tell us about the nature of spiral structure in galaxies. I will address both these topics using the results of recent simulations and observations. Galactic scale simulations are beginning to examine in detail the evolution of GMCs as they form in <b>spiral</b> <b>arms,</b> and then disperse by stellar feedback or shear. The overall timescale for this process appears comparable to the crossing time of the GMCs, a few Myrs for 105 M clouds, 20 Myr or so for more massive GMCs. Both simulations and observations show that the massive clouds are found in the <b>spiral</b> <b>arms,</b> likely as a result of cloud-cloud collisions. Simulations including stars should also tell us about the stellar age distribution in GMCs, and across <b>spiral</b> <b>arms.</b> More generally, recent work on spiral galaxies suggests that the dynamics of gas flows in <b>spiral</b> <b>arms</b> are different in longlived and transient <b>spiral</b> <b>arms,</b> resulting in different age patterns in the stars.

2500|$|While a {{planetary}} system may enjoy a location favorable to complex life, {{it must also}} maintain that location for a span of time sufficiently long for complex life to evolve. Hence a central star with a galactic orbit that steers clear of galactic regions where radiation levels are high, such as the Galactic Center and the spiral arms, would appear most favourable. If the central star's galactic orbit is eccentric (elliptic or hyperbolic), it will pass through some spiral arms, but if the orbit is a near perfect circle and the orbital velocity equals the [...] "rotational" [...] velocity of the spiral arms, the star will drift into a <b>spiral</b> <b>arm</b> region only gradually—if at all. Therefore, Rare Earth proponents conclude that a life-bearing star must have a galactic orbit that is nearly circular about the center of its galaxy. The required synchronization of the orbital velocity of a central star with the wave velocity of the spiral arms can occur only within a fairly narrow range of distances from the Galactic Center. This region is termed the [...] "galactic habitable zone".
