40|$|In this article, {{restrictions}} on the constituents of Kronecker <b>products</b> of <b>spin</b> characters of the double covers of the symmetric groups are derived. This is then used to classify homogeneous and irreducible <b>products</b> of <b>spin</b> characters; as an application of this, certain homogeneous 2 -modular tensor products for the symmetric groups are described. 1 Introduction In recent years, a number of results on Kronecker products of complex S n -characters have been obtained. In particular, the rectangular hull for the constituents in such products was found, and this {{was used for the}} classication of products with few homogeneous components; see [1] for this classication result and references to related work. Here, we provide similar results for <b>products</b> of <b>spin</b> characters for the double covers e S n of the symmetric groups. The rectangular hull for <b>spin</b> <b>products</b> is determined in Theorem 3. 2; this result serves as a crucial tool for the classication of homogeneous <b>spin</b> <b>products</b> in Theorem 4 [...] ...|$|R

Spin flips occur with Glauber-type rates generalised {{to the case}} of two temperatures. Driven by the temperature differential, the spin chain settles into a non-equilibrium steady state which corresponds to the stationary solution of a master equation. We construct a perturbation expansion of this master equation in terms of the temperature difference and compute explicitly the first two corrections to the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution.

40|$|AbstractThe {{selection}} of a solvent or a solvent system is a fundamental and a crucial step in spinning fibres using a selected process. Solvent selection determines the critical minimum polymer concentration and the critical minimum chain entanglement which allows the spinning of nanofibres rather than other hybrid morphologies such as beaded structures. Pressurised gyration, which simultaneously combines the use of gas pressure and rotation, is used as the processing and forming route for spinning fibres in this work. This study investigates 23 different solvents and solvent systems spread on a wide area of a Teas graph and able to dissolve the functional polymer polyethylene (terephthalate) (PET) and <b>spin</b> <b>products</b> by the application of pressurised gyration. The results are mapped on a Teas graph to identify the solubility–spinnability region. Based on this solubility–spinnability region, various solvents and binary solvent systems that allow the making of PET fibres are suggested. Scaling laws {{for the relationship between}} polymer concentration and specific viscosity are identified. The structural evolution in the fibres prepared is elucidated. For the first time, a mathematical model to scale fibre diameter with respect to flow properties and processing parameters encountered in pressurised gyration has been successfully developed...|$|R
