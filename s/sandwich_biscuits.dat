25|$|Palestinian {{officials}} estimated on 4 September that, with 17,000 homes {{destroyed by}} Israeli bombing, the reconstruction would cost $7.8 billion, {{which is about}} 3 times Gaza's GDP for 2011. Gaza City suffered damage to 20–25% of its housing and Beit Hanoun with 70% of its housing uninhabitable. The New York Times noted that damage in this third war was more severe than in the two preceding wars, where {{in the aftermath of}} the earlier Operation Cast Lead the damage inflicted was $4 billion, 3 times the then GDP of Gaza's economy. Strikes on Gaza's few industries will take years to repair. Gaza's main power plant on Salaheddin Road was damaged. Two sewage pumping stations in Zeitoun were damaged. The biggest private company in Gaza, the Alawda biscuit and ice cream factory, employing 400, was destroyed by a shelling barrage on 31 July, a few days after undertaking to supply its Choco <b>Sandwich</b> <b>biscuits</b> to 250,000 refugees in response to a request from the World Food Programme; other strikes targeted a plastics factory, a sponge-making plant, the offices of Gaza's main fruit distribution network, the El Majd Industrial and Trading Corporation's factory for cardboard box, carton and plastic bag production, Gaza's biggest dairy product importer and distributor, Roward International. Trond Husby, chief of the UN's Gaza development programme in Gaza, commented that the level of destruction now is worse than in Somalia, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Uganda.|$|E
5000|$|The verb to {{sandwich}} has {{the meaning}} [...] "to position anything between two other things {{of a different}} character, or to place different elements alternately," [...] and the noun sandwich has related meanings derived from this more general definition. For example, an ice cream sandwich consists of a layer of ice cream between two layers of cake or biscuit. Similarly, Oreos and Custard Creams are described as <b>sandwich</b> <b>biscuits</b> (UK/Commonwealth) or sandwich cookies (US) because they consist of a soft filling between the baked layers.|$|E
50|$|Cookies or {{biscuits}} may be mass-produced in factories, made {{in small}} bakeries or home-made. Biscuit or cookie variants include <b>sandwich</b> <b>biscuits,</b> such as Custard creams, Jammie Dodgers, Bourbons and Oreos, with marshmallow or jam filling and sometimes dipped in chocolate or another sweet coating. Cookies are often served with beverages such as milk, coffee or tea. Factory-made cookies {{are sold in}} grocery stores, convenience stores and vending machines. Fresh-baked cookies are sold at bakeries and coffeehouses, with the latter ranging from small business-sized establishments to multinational corporations such as Starbucks.|$|E

5000|$|In 2004, Arnott's {{caused a}} {{controversy}} when they released limited edition Tim Tam Tia Maria and Kahlua Mint Slice varieties, flavoured {{with the popular}} alcoholic liqueurs. The Australian Drug Foundation suggested selling the biscuits in supermarkets was [...] "potentially dangerous" [...] by [...] "normalising" [...] the taste of alcohol for children. An Arnott's spokesperson observed that a customer [...] "would need to consume your body weight of biscuits every hour to reach a blood-alcohol content of [...]05".Tim Tam Chocolate <b>Sandwich</b> <b>Biscuits</b> are manufactured in Indonesia by Halo Arnotts.

5000|$|Pâté Sablé same {{ingredients}} as pâté sucrée, but {{the butter}} is creamed with {{the sugar and}} the eggs before the flour is folded in. This mixes the butter more evenly, which makes the dough puff much less, creating a more [...] "snappy" [...] and dry pastry, instead of the crumbly texture of the previous doughs. Sablés work better for sweet tarts, tea biscuits, and piped shapes than other short doughs, as they hold their shape much more efficiently, and are the basis for gingerbread and <b>sandwich</b> <b>biscuits.</b> No water is needed, neither is the dough particularly temperature-sensitive.|$|E

40|$|A gas {{chromatography}} tandem mass spectrometry {{has been developed}} and validated for the separation, detection, identification and quantification of acrylamide in bread, biscuits and similar products. The method showed good precision with values lower than 6 %. A good sensitivity was achieved for bread with 2. 41 and 7. 23 µg kg- 1 limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ), respectively, while for biscuits, LOD and LOQ were 4. 63 and 13. 89 µg kg- 1, respectively. Accuracy obtained through the bias of 2 certified reference materials ("crisp bread - ERM®-BD 272 " and "rusk - ERM®-BD 274 ") gave a value below 1. 68 - 2. 52 %. The method was applied by analyzing 49 types of bread, biscuits and other similar products. The results showed different levels of acrylamide in bread (values ranged between 7. 6 and 165. 6 µg kg- 1), biscuits (between LOD and 2405. 0 µg kg- 1), <b>sandwich</b> <b>biscuits</b> with cream (112. 6 - 570. 4 µg kg- 1), biscuits for infants and young children (between LOD and 801. 7 µg kg- 1), gingerbread (349. 5 - 955. 5 µg kg- 1) and crackers (347. 8 - 366. 1 µg kg- 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Gas {{chromatography}} (GC) {{coupled with}} mass spectrometer (MS) or ﬂame ionization detector (FID) {{is the most}} widely used technique for determination of fatty acids (FA), including trans fatty acids (TFA). TFA are associated with an undesirable effect on serum lipid profiles, and thus may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, being considered in this respect, worse than saturated fat. The aim {{of this study was to}} optimize and validate a GC method for the quantification of FA in foods. Moreover, the developed method was applied for the FA quantification in bakery products. FA methyl esters were separated in SP- 2560 column (100 m x 0. 25 mm i. d., 0. 25 µm). GC method was validated regarding linearity, limits of detection and quantification, recovery, accuracy and precision. FA profile of different types of bakery products (filled and unfilled sweet biscuits, <b>sandwich</b> <b>biscuits,</b> brioche with filling, filled croissants, salty snacks, wafers and crackers) was determined. According to the obtained results, the validated method presented good linearity for the following concentrations: palmitic acid (27 – 2730 µg/mL); palmitoleic acid (35 – 202 µg/mL); stearic acid (27 – 2730 µg/mL); oleic acid (45 – 4547 µg/mL); linoleic acid (45 – 4549 µg/mL); linolenic acid (53 – 300 µg/mL); elaidic acid (7 – 135 µg/mL); and linoelaidic acid (6 – 102 µg/mL). Determination coefficients (r 2) were always equal or greater than 0. 9989, indicating suitability for quantification. The most abundant saturated FA found in the analysed bakery products was palmitic acid. In summary, the validated method is suitable for routine analysis of FA. Moreover, FA profile of foodstuffs could be used for several purposes, namely for labelling of foods and quality control. This work was funded by National Institute of Health Dr. Ricardo Jorge, I. P.
