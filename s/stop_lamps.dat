25|$|One {{potential}} problem with flashing <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> in the United States (and Canada) is the regulations that permit flashing <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> {{to be used}} in lieu of separate rear turn signal and hazard warning lamps.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of twin rear {{fog lamps}} say two lamps provide vehicle {{distance}} information not available from a single lamp. Proponents of the single rear fog lamp say dual {{rear fog lamps}} closely mimic the appearance of illuminated <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> (which are mandatorily installed in pairs), reducing the conspicuity of the stop lamps' message when the rear fogs are activated. To provide some safeguard against rear fog lamps being confused with <b>stop</b> <b>lamps,</b> UN Regulation 48 requires a separation of at least 10cm between the closest illuminated edges of any stop lamp and any rear fog lamp.|$|E
25|$|Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) {{are being}} used with {{increasing}} frequency in automotive lamps. They offer very long service life, extreme vibration resistance, and can permit considerably shallower packaging compared to most bulb-type assemblies. LEDs also offer a potential safety benefit when employed in stop lights, because when power is applied they rise to full intensity approximately 250 milliseconds (¼ second) faster than incandescent bulbs. This fast rise time not only improves the intentional conspicuity of the stop lamp, but could also provide following drivers with increased time {{to react to the}} appearance of the <b>stop</b> <b>lamps.</b> However, this faster rise time has not been shown to make cars with LED <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> less likely to be struck from behind.|$|E

25|$|Conspicuity for {{the rear}} of a vehicle is {{provided}} by rear position lamps (also called tail lamps or tail lights). These are required to produce only red light and to be wired such that they are lit whenever the front position lamps are lit, including when the headlamps are on. Rear position lamps may be combined with the vehicle's <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> or separate from them. In combined-function installations, the lamps produce brighter red light for the stop lamp function and dimmer red light for the rear position lamp function. Regulations worldwide stipulate minimum intensity ratios between the bright (stop) and dim (rear position) modes, so that a vehicle displaying rear position lamps will not be mistakenly interpreted as showing <b>stop</b> <b>lamps,</b> and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|International UN Regulations {{explicitly}} permit vehicle signal lamps with intensity automatically increased during bright {{daylight hours}} when sunlight reduces {{the effectiveness of}} the <b>stop</b> <b>lamps,</b> and automatically decreased during hours of darkness when glare could be a concern. Both US and UN regulations contain provisions for determining the minimum and maximum acceptable intensity for lamps that contain more than a single light source.|$|E
25|$|The CHMSL is {{intended}} to provide a warning to drivers whose view of the vehicle's left and right <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> is blocked by interceding vehicles. It also provides a redundant stop light signal {{in the event of}} a stop lamp malfunction. In North America where rear turn signals are permitted to emit red light, the CHMSL also helps to disambiguate brake lights from rear position lights and turn signal lights.|$|E

25|$|The linear {{format of}} the neon light source lends itself to centre high-mount <b>stop</b> <b>lamp</b> installation, and neon lights offer the same nearly instant rise time as LEDs. However, neon tubes require a ballast.|$|R
25|$|In Canada and the US {{the rear}} signals may be amber or red. American {{regulators}} and other proponents of red rear turn signals have historically asserted {{there is no}} proven safety benefit to amber signals, though it has been recognized since the 1960s that amber turn signals are more quickly spotted than red ones. International proponents of amber rear signals say they are more easily discernible as turn signals, and U.S. studies in the early 1990s demonstrated improvements in the speed and accuracy of following drivers' reaction to <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> when the turn signals were amber rather than red.|$|E
25|$|The 1952 Volkswagen Bus was {{equipped}} with only one stop lamp, mounted centrally and higher than {{the left and right}} rear lamps which did not produce a stop lamp function. The 1968–1971 Ford Thunderbird could be ordered with optional supplemental high-mounted stop and turn signal lights integrated into the left and right interior trim surrounding the backglass. The Oldsmobile Toronado from 1971 to 1978, and the Buick Riviera from 1974 to 1976 had similar dual high-mounted supplemental stop/turn lights as standard equipment; these were located {{on the outside of the}} vehicle below the bottom of the backglass. This type of configuration was not widely adopted at the time. Auto and lamp manufacturers in Germany experimented with dual high-mount supplemental <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> in the early 1980s, but this effort, too, failed to gain wide popular or regulatory support.|$|E
25|$|On {{passenger}} cars, the CHMSL may {{be placed}} above the back glass, {{affixed to the}} vehicle's interior just inside the back glass, {{or it may be}} integrated into the vehicle's deck lid or into a spoiler. Other specialised fitments are sometimes seen; the Jeep Wrangler and Land Rover Freelander have the CHMSL on a stalk fixed to the spare wheel carrier. Trucks, vans and commercial vehicles sometimes have the CHMSL mounted to the trailing edge of the vehicle's roof. The CHMSL is required by regulations worldwide to be centred laterally on the vehicle, though UN Regulation 48 permits lateral offset of up to 15cm if the vehicle's lateral centre is not coincident with a fixed body panel, but instead separates movable components such as doors. The Renault Master and Ford Transit van, for example, uses a laterally offset CHMSL for this reason. The height of the CHMSL is also regulated, in absolute terms and with respect to the mounting height of the vehicle's conventional left and right <b>stop</b> <b>lamps.</b> Depending on the left and right lamps' height, the lower edge of the CHMSL may be just above the left and right lamps' upper edge.|$|E
50|$|A center high-mount <b>stop</b> <b>lamp</b> was installed. The {{regulation}} {{called for}} a third brake light {{at the base of}} the rear window. However, due to the design of the van's rear lights, it was below the tail lights, making the name something of a misnomer.|$|R
25|$|Effective {{with the}} 1986 model year, the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Transport Canada {{mandated}} that all new passenger cars come {{equipped with a}} CHMSL. The requirement was extended to light trucks and vans for the 1994 model year. Early studies involving taxicabs and other fleet vehicles found that a third, high-level <b>stop</b> <b>lamp</b> reduced rear-end collisions by about 50%. Once the novelty effect wore off as most vehicles on the road came to be equipped with the central third <b>stop</b> <b>lamp,</b> the crash-avoidance benefit declined. However, it did not decline to zero, and a CHMSL is so inexpensive to incorporate into a vehicle {{that it is a}} cost-effective collision avoidance feature even at the long-term enduring crash-reduction benefit of 4.3%.|$|R
25|$|Minor changes {{occurred}} from 1986 to 89, {{including new}} paint colors, a center high mount <b>stop</b> <b>lamp</b> (CHMSL) midway through 1986 for North American models, a {{move away from}} the fade-prone brown carpet and new turn signal levers. Some 1988 models featured automatic seatbelts that extended from a large device between the front seats.|$|R
2500|$|Other {{methods of}} severe-braking {{indication}} {{have also been}} implemented; some Volvo models make the <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> brighter, and some BMWs have [...] "Adaptive Brake Lights" [...] that effectively {{increase the size of}} the stop lights under severe braking by illuminating the tail lamps at brighter-than-normal intensity. As long as the brighter-than-normal <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> are within the regulated maximum intensity for <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> in general, this kind of implementation does not require specific regulatory approval since the <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> are under all conditions operating in accord with the general regulations on <b>stop</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... {{devices are}} the lamps and reflectors {{that make a}} vehicle {{conspicuous}} and visible with respect to its presence, position, direction of travel, change in direction or deceleration. Such lamps may burn steadily, blink, or flash, depending on their intended and regulated function. Most must be fitted in pairs—one left and one right—though some vehicles have multiple pairs (such as two left and two right <b>stop</b> <b>lamps)</b> and/or redundant light sources (such as one left and one right stop lamp, each containing two bulbs).|$|E
2500|$|Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, and BMW have {{released}} vehicles equipped {{to convey a}} special light signal when the vehicle is braked rapidly and severely. This is officially referred to as [...] "emergency stop signal", and UN Regulation 48 calls for the lamps providing the ESS to flash at 4 Hz when a passenger car decelerates at greater than 6m/s2 or a truck or bus decelerates at greater than 4m/s2. Mercedes vehicles flash the <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> for the ESS, while vehicles from the Volkswagen Group of manufacturers (VW, Audi, SEAT and Skoda) flash the hazard flashers.|$|E
50|$|In 1998 Wipac was {{acquired}} by Carclo {{and in recent years}} became specifically known for LED lights for vehicles including the high mounted <b>stop</b> <b>lamp</b> for the 1995 Cadillac Catera, one of the first multifunction LED tail lamps for the 2001 Porsche Carrera GT, and the front and rear lights for the 2011 Lamborghini Aventador.|$|R

5000|$|For MY 1993, Ford did a minor {{redesign}} of the SHO interior, updating the center console. Other changes for 1993 included a trunklid spoiler, with integrated center high mount <b>stop</b> <b>lamp,</b> and [...] "Italian" [...] or directional Slicer wheels. With {{the addition of}} Italian slicers the SHO now had right and left specific wheels.|$|R
2500|$|In the United States and Canada since 1986, in Australia and New Zealand since 1990, and in Europe {{and other}} {{countries}} applying UN Regulation 48 since 1998, a central stop (brake) lamp mounted higher than the vehicle's left and right <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> and called a [...] "centre high mount stop lamp (CHMSL)", is also required. The CHMSL (pronounced [...] ) is sometimes informally called the [...] "centre brake lamp", the [...] "third brake light", the [...] "eye-level brake lamp", the [...] "safety brake lamp", or the [...] "high-level brake lamp". The CHMSL may use one or more filament bulbs or LEDs, or a strip of Neon tube as its light source.|$|E
2500|$|Red steady-burning rear lights, {{brighter}} than the rear position lamps, are activated when the driver applies the vehicle's brakes. These are formally called <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> in technical standards and regulations [...] and in the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, though informally they are sometimes called [...] "brake lights". They are required to be fitted in multiples of two, symmetrically at {{the left and right}} edges of the rear of every vehicle. International UN regulations specify a range of acceptable intensity for a stop lamp of 60 to 185 candela. In North America where the UN regulations are not recognised, the acceptable range for a single-compartment stop lamp is 80 to 300 candela.|$|E
2500|$|LEDs {{were first}} applied to {{automotive}} lighting in centre high-mount <b>stop</b> <b>lamps</b> (CHMSL), {{beginning with the}} 1984 Chevrolet Corvette. Adoption of LEDs for other signal functions on passenger cars is gradually increasing with demand for the technology and related styling updates. In North America, the 2000 Cadillac Deville was the first passenger car with LED taillights. The 2002 Kia Opirus/Amanti was an early adopter of LED front turn signals. The 2007 Audi R8 sports car uses two strips of optically focused high-intensity LEDs for its daytime running lamps. Optional on the R8 outside North America was the world's first LED headlamp, made by AL-Automotive Lighting. The low and high beams, along with the position (parking) lamp and front turn signal, are all realised with LEDs. [...] The Lexus LS 600h features LED low beam, position and side marker lamps in North America, and the 2009 Cadillac Escalade Platinum uses LEDs for the low and high beams, {{as well as for}} the position and side marker lamps. The Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W222) has no non-LED lamps at all, not even in the most basic trim level.|$|E
2500|$|The vehicle {{went on sale}} in 1990 and was {{available}} only as a fastback coupe. It was distinguishable from other Corvette coupes by its wider tail section, 11" [...] wide rear wheels and its new convex rear fascia with four square shaped taillights and a CHMSL (center high mounted <b>stop</b> <b>lamp)</b> attached {{to the top of}} the hatch glass instead of between the taillights.|$|R

2500|$|In the United States, {{federal law}} {{governing}} ICE motorized bicycles {{is subject to}} interpretative rulings by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) at the United States Department of Transportation. Under current NHTSA rules, a [...] "motor-driven cycle" [...] (a definition that includes a two-wheel vehicle such as a bicycle with an add-on ICE engine of five brake horsepower or less, a speed capability of more than 20 miles per hour and/or lacks both a Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and standard on-road safety equipment such as mirrors, turn signal lamps, side marker lamps, and <b>stop</b> <b>lamps),</b> then the vehicle shall {{not be considered a}} [...] "motor vehicle" [...] as defined by DOT/NHTSA regulations, but instead is defined as an off-road vehicle (since the lack of a VIN and on-road equipment indicates that a vehicle was not manufactured primarily for use on public roads.) Such off-road vehicles are considered to be neither motor vehicles nor motorcycles, as those terms are defined under federal law. Under present-day NHTSA rules, the final decision as to whether such federally defined off-road vehicles may be legally operated on public roads is determined by the laws of the state in which the vehicle is being operated.|$|E
