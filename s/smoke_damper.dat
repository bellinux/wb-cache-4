50|$|Smoke dampers {{are driven}} by a motor, {{referred}} to as an actuator. A probe connected to the motor is installed in {{the run of the}} duct and detects smoke, either in the air which has been extracted from or is being supplied to a room, or elsewhere within the run of the duct. Once smoke is detected, the actuator will automatically close the <b>smoke</b> <b>damper</b> until it is manually re-opened.|$|E

In this study, numerical simulation has been carried out to study the influence of <b>smoke</b> <b>damper</b> configuration on point extraction ventilation system of an urban tunnel using FDS 5. 5. Six fire scenarios have been simulated with different damper configurations, and simulation results of damper flow rate, visibility and temperature distribution in the tunnel have been analyzed to evaluate the different fire cases. It can be concluded that the damper area has little influence on the fire smoke control when it is large than 3 m 2, but the damper number and damper spacing have much more influence on smoke control of the point extraction ventilation system of this tunnel...|$|E
60|$|It was a murky confusion--here {{and there}} blotted with a colour like the colour of the <b>smoke</b> from <b>damp</b> fuel--of flying clouds, tossed up into most {{remarkable}} heaps, suggesting greater heights {{in the clouds}} than there were depths below them {{to the bottom of}} the deepest hollows in the earth, through which the wild moon seemed to plunge headlong, as if, in a dread disturbance of the laws of nature, she had lost her way and were frightened. There had been a wind all day; and it was rising then, with an extraordinary great sound. In another hour it had much increased, and the sky was more overcast, and blew hard.|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the effectiveness of liquid smoke from Laban wood for controlling fungi that cause damping off on pine seeds and {{to determine}} the optimal concentration and temperature of pyrolysis of liquid smoke from Laban wood. The experiment was conducted at the Laboratory of Wood Technology, Faculty of Forestry, University of Tanjungpura Pontianak. Mucor sp is the species of fungi which used to in vitro test {{to determine the}} inhibition value. Research using RAL Factorial methods with two treatment factors, first treatment factor is the concentration of liquid smoke from Laban wood with 5 levels i. e. 0 %, 2. 5 %, 5 %, 7. 5 %, and 10 %. The second treatment factor is {{the temperature of the}} pyrolysis liquid smoke of Laban wood with 3 levels i. e. 350 ºC, 400 ºC and 450 ºC. Five replicates are conducted for all treatments. Tests carried out using a PDA medium mixed with liquid smoke from Laban wood with each concentration. Results of research showed that the concentration of liquid smoke from Laban wood is very significant effect on the inhibition of the growth of the fungus Mucor sp. Meanwhile the pyrolysis temperature and the interaction of liquid smoke from Laban wood had no significant effect. Liquid smoke from Laban wood at a concentration of 10 % with a pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C is the best treatment because it can inhibited the growth of fungal Mucor sp. with the highest value (96. 33 %). This antifungal activity rate fulfills the very strong category inhibition. Liquid smoke from Laban wood can be used as biopesticide to overcome damping off fungi on Pine seed.

60|$|The {{following}} {{three or four}} months (Sept. to Dec. '79) I made quite a western journey, fetching up at Denver, Colorado, and penetrating the Rocky Mountain region enough to get a good notion of it all. Left West Philadelphia after 9 o'clock one night, middle of September, in a comfortable sleeper. Oblivious of the two or three hundred miles across Pennsylvania; at Pittsburgh in the morning to breakfast. Pretty good view of the city and Birmingham--fog and <b>damp,</b> <b>smoke,</b> coke-furnaces, flames, discolor'd wooden houses, and vast collections of coal-barges. Presently a bit of fine region, West Virginia, the Panhandle, and crossing the river, the Ohio. By day through the latter State--then Indiana--and so rock'd to slumber for a second night, flying like lightning through Illinois.|$|R
40|$|One {{hundred and}} ninety three {{children}} with asthma and 318 controls aged 1 - 4 years were evaluated for atopic heredity {{and exposure to}} possible indoor risk factors for asthma-for example exposure to furred pets, tobacco smoke, and home dampness. A subgroup of cases were classified as cat and/or dog allergic {{on the basis of}} skin prick tests. Heredity for asthma was a significant risk factor (odds ratio (OR) 3. 0, confidence interval (CI) 2. 1 to 4. 6). Environmental tobacco smoke was associated with an excess risk for asthma (OR 1. 7, CI 1. 1 to 2. 3) and signs of home dampness tended to increase this risk (OR 1. 3, CI 0. 9 to 2. 0). High dose exposure to cat and/or dog resulted in an increased risk only in asthma cases sensitised to cat and/or dog (OR 2. 7, CI 1. 0 to 7. 3). A combination of high dose exposure to cat and/or dog, environmental tobacco <b>smoke</b> and <b>damp</b> housing was associated with an OR of 8. 0 (CI 1. 9 to 34. 1). Raised indoor humidity has been shown to reflect low air exchange, which may also lead to increased doses of inhaled aeroallergens and tobacco smoke, and contribute to the interaction between the three risk factors...|$|R
6000|$|The painting-up {{which the}} apartments, {{as they always}} call themselves, undergo inside and out, in {{preparation}} for the season, is a rite to which all London bows during April as far as it can afford it. The lodging-house may restrict itself to picking out in fresh green its front door and window-frames, or perhaps reddening its area railing; but private houses pretending to be smart clothe themselves from eave to basement in coats of creamy white, or other blond tints susceptible of the soonest harm from the natural and artificial climates of London. While the paint is fresh, or [...] "wet," [...] the word by which you are warned from its contact everywhere, it is undeniably pleasing; it gives the gray town an air of girlish innocence, and, with the boxes of brilliant flowers at every window-sill, promises a gayety which the season realizes in rather unusual measure. It is said that the flowers at the windows must be renewed every month, against the blight of the London <b>smoke</b> and <b>damp,</b> and, if the paint cannot be renewed so often, it is of perhaps a little more durable beauty. For a month of preparation, while the house-fronts in the fashionable streets are escaladed by painters emulous of the perils of the samphire-gatherer's dreadful trade, the air is filled with the clean, turpentiny odor, and the eye is pleased with the soft colors in which the grimy walls remember the hopes of another spring, of another London season.|$|R
6000|$|Never did the Knights of Arthur's Round Table {{meet in a}} stouter fight {{than did}} these two. In a moment Robin stepped quickly upon the bridge where the {{stranger}} stood; first he made a feint, and then delivered a blow at the stranger's head that, had it met its mark, would have tumbled him speedily into the water. But the stranger turned the blow right deftly and in return gave one as stout, which Robin also turned as the stranger had done. So they stood, each in his place, neither moving a finger's-breadth back, for one good hour, and many blows were given and received by each in that time, till here and there were sore bones and bumps, yet neither thought of crying [...] "Enough," [...] nor seemed likely to fall from off the bridge. Now and then they stopped to rest, and each thought that he never had seen in all his life before such a hand at quarterstaff. At last Robin gave the stranger a blow upon the ribs that made his jacket <b>smoke</b> like a <b>damp</b> straw thatch in the sun. So shrewd was the stroke that the stranger came within a hair's-breadth of falling off the bridge, but he regained himself right quickly and, by a dexterous blow, gave Robin a crack on the crown that caused the blood to flow. Then Robin grew mad with anger and smote {{with all his might}} at the other. But the stranger warded the blow and once again thwacked Robin, and this time so fairly that he fell heels over head into the water, as the queen pin falls in a game of bowls.|$|R
40|$|AbstractLife {{safety is}} one of the {{objectives}} of fire engineering design for road tunnels. Fire engineering design requires maintaining a tenable condition {{for a period of time}} to allow occupants to evacuate to safety. This will be achieved by controlling the smoke under credible design fire scenarios in a tunnel. The critical location in a tunnel fire emergency condition is the tunnel region upstream of the fire, where occupants are most likely to reside as traffic jam can usually be created by the fire incident. Tenability for the downstream region of fire is not the main focus of this research because vehicles can generally drive out of the tunnel at a higher speed than that of the smoke flow, and local <b>damper</b> <b>smoke</b> extraction can help keep a tenable condition in the downstream region beyond the local fire zone, in case there is a congestion in the downstream region of the fire. To maintain a tenable condition in the upstream tunnel region from the fire incident, the required minimum longitudinal flow velocity to prevent smoke backlayering can be calculated based on NFPA 502 recommendations. This critical velocity takes no credit of the smoke extraction or active overhead fixed fire suppression effects. Smoke extraction with a dedicated smoke duct along the entire length of the tunnel is gaining popularity because of its efficiency and robustness in providing a tenable environment in the tunnel with unknown upstream and downstream traffic conditions. In this paper, a modified critical velocity to control smoke back-layering while smoke extraction and fire suppression systems are operating has been analyzed. This modified critical velocity is approximately 20 % lower than the critical velocity that is recommended in NFPA 502. This allows significant savings on ventilation capacity for road tunnels which have a local smoke exhaust capability using a dedicated smoke duct. It is concluded that the smoke extraction performance is similar whether using ceiling dampers or vertical wall-mounted dampers for smoke capture to maintain tunnel tenability. However, tunnel gradients play a major role on the modified critical velocity for a nominated design fire and the required smoke extraction rate...|$|R
