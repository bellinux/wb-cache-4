40|$|Nucleic acid is {{the basis}} of life. There are 2 types, ribose nucleic acid (RNA) and {{deoxyribose}} nucleic acid (DNA). DNA, the material found in the chromosomes within the nuclei of the cells of most living organisms, bears the genetic code that determines all of the characteristics of a living organism. Information from the DNA of the chromosomes is carried to all parts of the cell by one type of RNA called messenger RNA. Additional specialized RNA molecules are found inside the ribosomes, tiny bodies within the protoplasm that make proteins for the cell. Still other, smaller <b>RNA</b> molecules, called <b>soluble</b> <b>RNAs</b> play {{an active role in the}} synthesis of proteins by linking with the building blocks (amino acids) that form new protein.

40|$|Developing a {{universal}} influenza vaccine that induces broad spectrum and longer-term immunity {{has become an}} important potentially achievable target in influenza vaccine research and development. Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are the two major influenza virus antigens. Although antibody responses against influenza virus are mainly directed toward HA, NA {{is reported to be}} more genetically stable; hence NA-based vaccines have the potential to be effective for longer time periods. NA-specific immunity has been shown to limit the spread of influenza virus, thus reducing disease symptoms and providing cross-protection against heterosubtypic viruses in mouse challenge experiments. The production of large quantities of highly pure and stable NA could be beneficial for the development of new antivirals, subunit-based vaccines, and novel diagnostic tools. In this study, recombinant NA (rNA) was produced in mammalian cells at high levels from both swine A/California/ 07 / 2009 (H 1 N 1) and avian A/turkey/Turkey/ 01 / 2005 (H 5 N 1) influenza viruses.

He discovered that certain enzymes were required to activate amino acids so they could associate with tRNA molecules and eventually be incorporated into new protein molecules. These enzymes were named aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. Incidentally, this lab’s discovery of tRNA supported the theory of complementarity (molecular biology) proposed by Watson and Crick.|$|E

The effect of its incorporation has been studied with particular reference to cell growth, nucleic acid composition, cytology, and the synthesis of the spore and crystal protein. Additions of the analogue during any stage of growth prevented further cell proliferation and all spore and crystal formation. Since both nucleic acids continued to be formed, cells of an increased size developed, containing large masses of chromatin {{in the form of}} condensed balls or axial cords. Lipid-containing inclusions also appeared following these additions and were usually aggregated at the centre or poles of the cells.

Additions of the analogue following commencement of sporulation did not prevent either spore or crystal formation or affect the nucleic acid content of the sporulating cells.

When a RNA-labeled nucleus was used, label appeared in the ribosomes, ribosomal RNA, and <b>soluble</b> <b>RNA.</b> Since the kinetics of appearance of labeled RNA indicates that the nucleus was not injured during the transfer, and since the transferred nuclear pool of labeled acid-soluble RNA precursors is inadequate to account for the amount of cytoplasmic RNA label, it is concluded that cytoplasmic ribosomal RNA is derived from acid-insoluble nuclear RNA and is probably transported as an intact molecule. Likewise, cytoplasmic <b>soluble</b> <b>RNA</b> probably originated in the nucleus, although labeling by terminal exchange in the cytoplasm is also possible. The results were completely different when a protein-labeled nucleus was grafted into an unlabeled host. In this case, label was found only in soluble proteins in the host cell cytoplasm, and there were no (or very few) radioactive ribosomes.

The regulatory step, therefore, was ascribed to DNA templates. The analysis of modified base composition revealed the presence of methylated bases in chromoplast DNA, in which 5 -methylcytosine was most abundant. The presence of 5 -methylcytosine detected by isoschizomeric endonucleases and Southern hybridization was correlated with the undetectable transcription activity of each gene in the run-on assay and in vitro transcription experiments. It is thus concluded that the suppression of transcription mediated by DNA methylation is one of the mechanisms governing gene expression in plastids converting from chloroplasts to chromoplasts...|$|R

The purified protein preparation was resolved into a predominant protein complex at 669 kDa by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis. Based on gel filtration chromatography the native molecular weight of the purified enzyme is approximately 620, 000. Using SDS-PAGE the purified enzyme is separated into ten polypeptides of 120, 110, 95, 84, 81, 75, 54, 51, 42, and 35 kDa. The enzyme is completely dependent on an exogenous DNA template for activity. The 110 kDa polypeptide binds nucleotide triphosphates. The 42 kDa polypeptide cross-reacts with antiserum raised to the plastid encoded α-subunit protein. The enzymatic properties of the <b>soluble</b> <b>RNA</b> polymerase from pea chloroplasts were determined. The apparent energy of activation for the incorporation of UMP into RNA is 34 kcal/mole.

Consequently, archives of FFPE samples remain unexploited in the quest to elucidate and validate the molecular mechanisms of diseases, cellular processes, and drug activity/safety. We validated the {{measurement of}} gene expression from FFPE tissue by a new multiplexed assay, the quantitative nuclease protection assay (qNPA). qNPA measures the RNA cross-linked to tissue without its having to be solubilized, plus the <b>soluble</b> <b>RNA</b> pool—i. e., the total RNA contained in the FFPE sample. This is likely one explanation of qNPA success where methods that measure only <b>soluble</b> <b>RNA</b> have failed. Cross-linked RNA is the major pool in FPE samples, and the fraction it makes up varies from sample to sample, presumably due to differences in fixation time or sample age. Consistent with the observation that qNPA measures the total RNA in fixed tissue, {{and the fact that it}} measures the total RNA in fresh samples, is the result that identical quantitative levels of gene expression are measured from fresh fixed and 18 -y-old FFPE tissue and from matched fresh or fixed tissue. The expression level for a set of low to moderately expressed genes from fresh vs. FFPE tissue correlated with an R 2 = 0. 99, slope = 1. Gene expression measurements in FFPE tissue provided average CVs < 10 %. A retrospective study using clinical diffuse large B-cell lymphoma samples was carried out, validating prognostic biomarkers of disease, disease subtype, and survival.

Moreover, we studied the effect of different crop load on flower bud differentiation. Samples of axillary meristematic apices were excised from the median portion of two types of one-year-old shoots: ‘ON’ (with fruits) and ‘OFF’ (without fruits). The samplings were periodically collected at different phenological stages from endocarp sclerification to early spring. The thin sections were analysed using histological (apex size), histochemical (starch, <b>soluble</b> carbohydrates, <b>RNA)</b> and immunohistochemical (ZR-Zeatin Riboside) techniques. The micromorphological observations and the histochemical procedures, used to characterise the changes in starch and total carbohydrate accumulation, didn’t permit distinguishing the apices sampled from ‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ shoots. ZR immuno-assay made it possible to identify a different localisation pattern between ‘ON’ and ‘OFF’ samples early on. The citokinine appeared distributed at dome level only in ‘OFF’ apices, particularly in July, at the endocarp sclerification phenological stage. At this time, the further strong signal observed for RNA detection could show that these changes are related to the floral evocation phase...|$|R
