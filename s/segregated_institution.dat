40|$|Using a {{symbolic}} interactionistic analytical approach, this essay aims {{to study the}} socialisation of young women’s sexuality in treatment institutions for young women. Through qualitative interviews with staff members at said institutions, concerning their views on young female sexuality, and how they discuss sexuality with the young women in the institutions, my aim was to identify the socialisation of young women’s sexuality. I have also investigated how the staff experiences their own sex as {{an important factor in}} conversations about sexuality with young women, as well as the possible effect sexually mixed or sexually <b>segregated</b> <b>institutions</b> exert upon conversations about sexuality. I have therefore interviewed both male and female staff, as well as staff of both sexually mixed and sexually <b>segregated</b> treatment <b>institutions.</b> The results indicate that the staff does talk about sexuality with the young women, but in varying degree and form. Treatment ideology seems {{to have an impact on}} the conversations of sexuality. The staff perceives their sex to be of importance for the conversations about sexuality but they also emphasise the importance of trusting relationships. They believe that sexuality as a subject arises more often in sexually mixed treatment institutions than in sexually <b>segregated</b> <b>institutions.</b> The staffs’ view on young female sexuality is not characterized by a discourse of desire, but rather by concern for the young women’s vulnerability, triggered by their own behaviour, as well as doubts about the young women’s own sexual desire...|$|R

50|$|Sometimes, {{countries}} will {{also argue that}} segregation in other nations violates human rights. For example, the United Nations and Western countries have encouraged kings of Saudi Arabia to end its strict segregation of institutions such as schools, government institutions, hospitals, and other public spaces {{in order to secure}} women's rights in Saudi Arabia Even though the removal of certain religious and government heads has made way for liberal agendas to promote desegregation, the public largely still subscribes {{to the idea of a}} segregated society, while institutions and the government itself still technically remain under the control of Wahhabism. Reform is small in size, since there is no constitution to back up policy changes concerning sex segregation. The Saudi people refer to this segregation as khalwa and violation of the separation is punishable by law. This separation is tangibly manifested in the recently erected wall in places that employ both men and women, a feat possible by a law passed in 2011 allowing Saudi women to work in lingerie shops in order to lower female unemployment rates. The public views the 1.6 meter wall favorably, saying that it will lead to less instances of harassment by men visiting the expatriate women in the shops. The Luthan hotel in Saudi Arabia was the country's first women's only hotel, acting more as a vacation spot for women than a mandated <b>segregated</b> <b>institution.</b> Upon entering the hotel, women are allowed to remove their headscarves and abayas and the hotel employs only women, calling their bellhops the world's first bellgirls, providing opportunities for Saudi women in IT and engineering jobs where, outside the Luthan, are quite scarce.|$|E

The dissolution of the doctrine of "separate but equal" has resulted in the acceptance of larger numbers of African-American health professionals to America's medical and dental educational institutions. The University of Tennessee School of Dentistry is a primary example of a formerly <b>segregated</b> <b>institution</b> that has changed its policies and presently possesses a respectable number of African-American dental alumni.

40|$|Parents of {{children}} with intellectual disabilities born in Ontario in the era following World War II found themselves obliged to make significant yet misinformed decisions regarding their child’s long-term care. Immersed in postwar discourse which promoted the normative construction of the Canadian family, in combination with limited community support and generalized misconceptions of intellectual disability, many families {{had to choose between}} two principal options: keep their child at home and raise a child with needs divergent from the “norm” with few resources, or place the child in a <b>segregated</b> <b>institution.</b> Dating back to {{the latter half of the}} mid-nineteenth century, large-scale institutions for people with intellectual disabilities had become the predominant model of care for people with intellectual disabilities in Ontario outside of the family home. Many thousands of individuals were admitted to institutions; this bore significant consequences both for those admitted and for the families who decided to send them there. To date, scholarly work on institutions has focused on historical, political, and social factors which contributed to their development, as well as the more recent address of the narratives and histories of people who have lived there. Little is known, however, about the effect on family relationships and understandings of disability when one member of the family is institutionalized. The purpose of this project is to explore family relationships and understandings of disability when a family member with an intellectual disability is institutionalized for an extended period of time. Its principal body of data stems from thirty-six in-depth interviews conducted with the members of several families, including parents who institutionalized their children, siblings of those institutionalized, and those who were themselves institutionalized in Ontario in the years following World War II. Family members had widely divergent experiences in regards to institutionalization processes. Interpretations of the impact institutionalization had on the family were dependent on one’s location in relation to institutionalization. Findings demonstrate how relations of power were manifested in the family though institutionalization processes, and show the significant role that discursive constructions of intellectual disability have had on participants’ understandings of disability and of their family member...|$|E

25|$|Education is free at all levels. The {{school system}} is {{composed}} of elementary, intermediate, and secondary schools. A {{large part of the}} curriculum at all levels is devoted to Islam, and, at the secondary level, students are able to follow either a religious or a technical track. The rate of literacy is 90.4% among males and is about 81.3% among females. Classes are segregated by sex. Higher education has expanded rapidly, with large numbers of Universities and colleges being founded particularly since 2000. Institutions of higher education include the country's first university, King Saud University founded in 1957, the Islamic University at Medina founded in 1961, and the King Abdulaziz University in Jeddah founded in 1967. King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, known as KAUST, founded recently in 2009.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} two {{theoretical}} concepts which are popular in agricultural economics: The "old " theory of delayed structural change in agriculture and resulting disparity of factor incomes, and the "new " theory on multifunctionality of agriculture, {{which refers to}} changes in jointness of production of commodities and non-commodities. These approaches are reconsidered from an institutional point of view, particularly by comparing the different impact of integrating institutions, such as the family farm system, and <b>segregating</b> <b>institutions,</b> for example, markets and competition, on structural adjustment and joint production. The results illustrate that agricultural change can only be properly understood if both the diversity of institutions and technologies and the interplay between institutions and technologies is paid attention to. Finally, the author outlines an analytical framework which gives an impression of the design of Institutions of Sustainability, and raises {{the question as to}} what normative implications institutionalising sustainable agricultural development may be associated with...|$|R

40|$|The {{presented}} work "Racial Integration of U. S.

Most of American society in 1940 's followed the racial segregation rules. The thesis approaches motives and roots, which led to baseball integration in time of unchallenged segregationist conventions. The main goal is to analyze the impact of the personal motives of Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey as well as the impact of outer factors, the Second World War and 1940 's New York State law-making process on this issue. According to conclusions, Rickey was instrumental in ending racial discrimination in baseball. This move was caused by coordination of economic, sports and strictly personal reasons. Above all, the success of the integration was based on New York State laws forbidding the segregation in employment and putting pressure on <b>segregated</b> <b>institutions,</b> thus on professional baseball organizations...|$|R

She was on the forefront of attempts to gain admission to racially <b>segregated</b> <b>institutions</b> of higher learning in the 1930s, and experimented with acts of civil disobedience against racial segregation in the American South that would become important elements of the successful civil rights movements of the 1950s and 1960s.
