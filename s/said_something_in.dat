2500|$|The Arab {{historian}} Ibn Athir {{remarks in}} his book, Al-Kamil, that, [...] "If we name it the Quran of 'Ajam, {{we have not}} <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> vain. [...] If a poet writes poetry and the poems have many verses, or if someone writes many compositions, {{it will always be}} the case that some of their writings might not be excellent. [...] But in the case of Shahnameh, despite having more than 40 thousand couplets, all its verses are excellent." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 13, 1942, {{as part of}} Operation Pastorius four German agents led by George John Dasch were landed by U202 [...] at what is now Atlantic Avenue Beach (sometimes called Coast Guard Beach) in Amagansett. Confronted by Coast Guardsman John C. Cullen, {{they said}} they were [...] Southampton fishermen. When one of the four <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> a foreign tongue, they offered him $300 to keep quiet. [...] The agents {{disappeared}} into the night after he sought out his supervisor. When reinforcements arrived they discovered German cigarettes on the beach along with four heavy, waterproof oaken boxes buried in the sand filled with brick-sized blocks of high explosives, bombs disguised as lumps of coal, bomb-timing mechanisms of German make, and innocent-looking “pen-and-pencil sets” that were actually incendiary weapons.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of this investigation, it emerged that some team members within McLaren, among them Alonso, were aware of {{confidential}} information belonging to the Ferrari team. [...] This information was commented on to Alonso by McLaren test driver Pedro de la Rosa who had also received information from McLaren chief designer Mike Coughlan. The email contained text suggesting that Alonso was surprised by the data and doubted its authenticity. According to the [...] "spygate" [...] related email exchanges between Alonso and de la Rosa, it was clear that Alonso knew about Ferrari's pit strategies in the Australian Grand Prix and Bahrain Grand Prix. Alonso finished 2nd and 5th respectively in those races. Ron Dennis told the FIA about the case during the [...] Amid media allegations that Alonso threatened Dennis with reporting the team to FIA himself if he was not given number one driver status, Ron Dennis stated in a televised interview that there had been an argument, and that Alonso had <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> {{the heat of the moment}} but immediately apologised. This was when Dennis found out about Ferrari data and immediately informed the FIA. Pitlane sources have suggested, from published FIA stewards data, that an argument involving reporting the McLaren team to the FIA was prompted by the fact that there was no stewards' investigation regarding the qualifying pitlane incident until Anthony and Lewis Hamilton made a formal complaint on the Saturday evening; costing Alonso a five-place grid penalty and loss of Constructors' Points for the team. FIA then revealed that it had had knowledge of the Spygate case thanks to a slip made by Coughlan.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, yes, you are." [...] That {{was all the}} much-tried Marilla <b>said,</b> but <b>something</b> <b>in</b> {{her tone}} squelched even Davy. He trotted obediently upstairs with Anne.|$|R
60|$|Horn <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> {{the native}} tongue, and two youths started off.|$|E
60|$|The grey man <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> a low {{tone that}} I did not hear.|$|E

6000|$|Nam-Bok made {{to come to}} her, but a growl of {{fear and}} menace warned him back. He <b>said</b> <b>something</b> angrily <b>in</b> a strange tongue, and added, [...] "No shadow am I, but a man." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Brumley had an {{impression}} that Mrs. Sawbridge had <b>said</b> <b>something</b> quite confidential <b>in</b> his ear. He turned perplexed.|$|R
60|$|The doctor <b>said</b> <b>something</b> about infatuation <b>in</b> a low {{and painful}} voice, {{and then with}} visible {{difficulty}} continued his opening remarks.|$|R
60|$|The Turks {{laughed and}} <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> their own language. They had no {{knowledge}} of English.|$|E
60|$|After {{staring at}} him for a minute, the boy <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> Irish. Harry shook his head.|$|E
60|$|The {{black eyes}} of the wop kid clouded. He gesticulated, and <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> his native language.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have fancied now {{and then}} that you must have <b>said</b> <b>something</b> remarkably <b>in</b> my favor that day at Scarthwaite," [...] he said. [...] "I never quite {{understood}} what brought up the subject, but Julia once referred to a picture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{not afraid}} of that,' <b>said</b> Flora, <b>something</b> <b>in</b> her eye belying her; 'but she might be {{troublesome}} to Harry, and I had rather {{he did not see}} one of her fights with Miss Morton.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did you not {{see that}} all the people bowed their heads just then," [...] rejoined Mr. George, [...] "and <b>said</b> <b>something</b> to {{themselves}} <b>in</b> a very reverent manner." ...|$|R
60|$|An officer, evidently in charge, saluted {{the boys}} {{as they came}} up, and <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> Russian.|$|E
60|$|Sampson <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> an {{undertone}} to Judge Owens, {{and that}} worthy nodded his great, bushy head.|$|E
60|$|Coulthurst {{touched his}} shoulder, and <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> his ear, {{but the young}} man moved away from him impatiently.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you'd do. But that boy, <b>said</b> <b>something</b> about {{bringing}} <b>in</b> a boat last night, and I {{want to know}} if it is our boat." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Deringham {{glanced at}} him curiously, and then laughed a little. [...] "Miss Townshead is evidently a {{determined}} young woman," [...] she <b>said,</b> with <b>something</b> <b>in</b> her manner which led Seaforth to fancy {{that this was not}} intended as a compliment. [...] "But what is Mr. Alton doing?" ...|$|R

60|$|Again the Doctor <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> a {{soothing}} voice, but his answer only roused his companion {{to a higher}} pitch of fury.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{think at}} all about it,' <b>said</b> Ethel, <b>something</b> <b>in</b> her father's manner. 'If we are to get through all this, Mary, it must not be by riding out on perhapses.

6000|$|... "We haven't got any father, either," [...] <b>said</b> Bab, for <b>something</b> <b>in</b> Miss Celia's face {{made her}} feel as if a cloud had come over the sun.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{not clear}} if this {{statement}} is an attack at anyone specific. It could have been aimed at Karl Harrer or at the Strasser group. According to Goodrick-Clarke, [...] "In any case, the outburst clearly implies Hitler's contempt for conspiratorial circles and occult-racist studies and his preference for direct activism." [...] Hitler also <b>said</b> <b>something</b> similar <b>in</b> public speeches.|$|R
60|$|The Arab hesitated, looked {{somewhat}} perplexed, and <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> Portuguese to Marizano, who {{pointed to}} the slave-girl, and spoke with considerable vehemence.|$|E
60|$|The Prince {{pointed to}} the flying-machine and <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> broken English that Bert took for German and failed to understand. He intimated as much.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned to}} her, and <b>said</b> <b>something</b> <b>in</b> the Indian tongue {{which seemed to}} comfort her greatly, for she replied with a look and tone of satisfaction.|$|E
60|$|This roused my temper. When a {{young lady}} is told that she is vulgar, if she has any self-conceit--I mean self-respect--she feels insulted.

6000|$|... "Is it {{possible}} that you have not seen last week's number of the paper?" [...] Mr. Paul asked. [...] "And you a literary man!"

[...] "Read that, sir," [...] he <b>said,</b> with <b>something</b> <b>in</b> his manner which looked like virtuous indignation.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{misunderstand}} me, sir. It was {{the entire}} company who sang. The head master {{turned to the}} organist and <b>said</b> <b>something</b> to him <b>in</b> a low tone. Upon which the latter began to play the national anthem, and the proceedings terminated." ...|$|R
