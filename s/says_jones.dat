50|$|Jones {{had become}} one of four world {{champion}}s, from no one wanting to fight him to being world champion in the space of 6 months. Many Great fighters wanted to fight him especially Winky Wright (who later picked up Jones' title on the way to becoming Undisputed Light Middleweight World Champion) The plan was for Jones to defend his WBO title against Bronco Banyon McKart of Bob Arum's Top Rank promotions. Both parties had a verbal agreement for the bout to be staged either in the UK or America. Many did <b>say</b> <b>Jones's</b> style would have been perfect for this big fight but unfortunately this did not materialise however Jones did go on to win the WBC Super Middle Weight International World Title. Jones' last fight was a points decision over the future EBU-EE Super Middleweight champion Kreshnik Qato. Jones retired in 2002 with a record of 31-12-1.|$|R

5000|$|In the {{introduction}} to Jonestown, Masters described Jones as having concealed his sexuality [...] "more {{for the sake of}} preserving a dishonest power base" [...] than for reasons of personal privacy, an explanation he repeated later when accused of being motivated by prurience. Additionally, Masters <b>says</b> that <b>Jones's</b> attempt to mask his sexuality is a defining feature of his personality and provides an explanation for many aspects of his behaviour. In the book's final chapter, Masters quotes a study performed by Roy Morgan Research that reported that [...] "46% of Jones's listeners believe that homosexuality is immoral, compared to 35% of all Australians." [...] Masters' attempts to explain so much about Jones by reference to his sexuality caused the commentator Miranda Devine to see his book as homophobic.|$|R

[...] O'Connell's review concluded, [...] "The text is packed with fascinating information and humorous touches. Even children who are not ordinarily interested in space or ecology will be interested in this book, and aficionados will go ga-ga."

40|$|Across {{the summer}} and fall of 2016, senior {{creative}} writing major Katie Higinbotham and I edited the nonfiction selections at High Desert Journal, where {{for the last three years}} I have worked as nonfiction editor. Katie served as my assistant editor and was given a byline on the masthead of the magazine for the most recent issue, HDJ 23. Katie also developed and coordinated a new series at High Desert Journal, What is the West?, in which noted authors take on that very question. Editor Charles Finn was incredibly impressed with Katie’s contributions and recently told me he wished we could afford to pay her to keep her on as a permanent assistant editor. Katie and I began our work by looking at past issues of HDJ, as well as initial and final drafts of recently accepted essays. We also spent some time setting goals concerning the number of pieces, style of work, and diversity of included voices. Throughout the summer we both read and took notes independently in the online submission system; in the afternoons, then—roughly two or three days a week—we 2 ̆ 7 d get together to talk through what we 2 ̆ 7 d read. We declined pieces that were easy calls at each meeting—though, too, we often tried to give these authors a note or two about what their piece was doing well—and compared and contrasted the pieces still under consideration, slowly winnowing the pool. As we identified accepted pieces, we notified the authors and begin working with them on the editorial process. Katie gave each piece a first read, correcting errors, of course, but also offering substantial editorial guidance, offering ideas for how each author could deepen the impact of their respective essay. I also offered ideas, though many times Katie’s thoughts were right in line with my own. We then forwarded these corrections and ideas to the authors and went back-and-forth with them as many times as it took to get the essay just right. In the end, we published four striking essays by four amazing authors: Travis Truax, Annie Lampman, Rachel Toor, and Jeff P. Jones. And we’re proud to <b>say</b> that Jeff <b>Jones’s</b> essay was one of HDJ’s four Pushcart Prize nominations for the entire year...|$|R

6000|$|... "In this way. Economy is {{the science}} of proportion. Whether a {{particular}} purchase is extravagant depends mainly on the income it is taken from. Suppose a woman has {{a hundred and fifty}} a year for her dress, and gives fifty dollars for a bonnet, she gives a third of her income,--it is a horrible extravagance; while for the woman whose income is ten thousand it may be no extravagance at all. The poor clergyman's wife, when she gives five dollars for a bonnet, may be giving as much in proportion to her income as the woman who gives fifty. Now the difficulty with the greater part of women is, that the men, who make the money and hold it, give them no kind of standard by which to measure their expenses. Most women and girls are in this matter entirely at sea, without chart or compass. They don't know in the least what they have to spend. Husbands and fathers often pride themselves about not saying a word on business matters to their wives and daughters. They don't wish them to understand them, or to inquire into them, or to make remarks or suggestions concerning them.

6000|$|Surrounded by her {{court and}} royal attendants, La Reine Marie used graciously {{to attend the}} play-table, where luck {{occasionally}} declared itself for and against her Majesty. Her appearance used to create not a little excitement in the Saloon of Roulette, the game which she patronised, it being more [...] "fertile of emotions" [...] than the slower trente-et-quarante. She dreamed of numbers, had favourite incantations by which to conjure them: noted the figures made by peels of peaches and so forth, the numbers of houses, on hackney-coaches--was superstitious comme toutes les rimes poetiques. She commonly brought a beautiful agate bonbonniere full of gold pieces, when she played. It was wonderful to see her grimaces: to watch her behaviour: her appeals to heaven, her delight and despair. Madame la Baronne de la Cruchecassee played {{on one side of}} her, Madame la Comtesse de Schlanigenbad on the other. When she had lost all her money her Majesty would condescend to borrow--not from those ladies:--knowing the royal peculiarity, they never had any money; they always lost; they swiftly pocketed their winnings and never left a mass on the table, or quitted it, as courtiers will, when they saw luck was going against their sovereign. The officers of her household were Count Punter, a Hanoverian, the Cavaliere Spada, Captain Blackball of a mysterious English regiment, which might be any one of the hundred and twenty in the Army List, and other noblemen and gentlemen, Greeks, Russians, and Spaniards. Mr. and Mrs. Jones (of England), who had made the princess's acquaintance at Bagneres (where her lord still remained in the gout) and perseveringly followed her all the way to Baden, were dazzled by the splendour of the company in which they found themselves. Miss Jones wrote such letters to her dearest friend Miss Thompson, Cambridge Square, London, as caused that young person to crever with envy. Bob Jones, who had grown a pair of mustachios since he left home, began to think slightingly of poor little Fanny Thompson, now he had got into [...] "the best Continental society." [...] Might not he quarter a countess's coat on his brougham along with the Jones arms, or, more slap-up still, have the two shields painted on the panels with the coronet over? [...] "Do you know the princess calls herself the Queen of Scots, and she calls me Julian Avenel?" [...] <b>says</b> <b>Jones</b> delighted, to Clive, who wrote me about the transmogrification of our schoolfellow, an attorney's son, whom I recollected a snivelling little boy at Grey Friars. [...] "I say, Newcome, the princess is going to establish an order," [...] cried Bob in ecstasy. Every one of her aides-de-camp had a bunch of orders at his button, excepting, of course, poor Jones.|$|E
6000|$|Another Finis written. Another mile-stone {{passed on}} this journey {{from birth to}} the next world! Sure it is a subject for solemn cogitation. Shall we {{continue}} this story-telling business and be voluble {{to the end of}} our age? Will it not be presently time, O prattler, to hold your tongue, and let younger people speak? I have a friend, a painter, who, like other persons who shall be nameless, is growing old. He has never painted with such laborious finish as his works now show. This master is still the most humble and diligent of scholars. Of Art, his mistress, he is always an eager, reverent pupil. In his calling, in yours, in mine, industry and humility will help and comfort us. A word with you. In a pretty large experience I have not found the men who write books superior in wit or learning to those who don't write at all. In regard of mere information, non-writers must often be superior to writers. You don't expect a lawyer in full practice to be conversant with all kinds of literature; he is too busy with his law; and so a writer is commonly too busy with his own books to be able to bestow attention on the works of other people. After a day's work (in which I have been depicting, let us say, the agonies of Louisa on parting with the Captain, or the atrocious behavior of the wicked Marquis to Lady Emily) I march to the Club, proposing to improve my mind and keep myself [...] "posted up," [...] as the Americans phrase it, with the literature of the day. And what happens? Given, a walk after luncheon, a pleasing book, and a most comfortable armchair by the fire, and you know the rest. A doze ensues. Pleasing book drops suddenly, is picked up once with an air of some confusion, is laid presently softly in lap: head falls on comfortable arm-chair cushion: eyes close: soft nasal music is heard. Am I telling Club secrets? Of afternoons, after lunch, I say, scores of sensible fogies have a doze. Perhaps I have fallen asleep over that very book to which [...] "Finis" [...] has just been written. [...] "And if the writer sleeps, what happens to the readers?" [...] <b>says</b> <b>Jones,</b> coming down upon me with his lightning wit. What? You DID sleep over it? And a very good thing too. These eyes have more than once seen a friend dozing over pages which this hand has written. There is a vignette somewhere in one of my books of a friend so caught napping with [...] "Pendennis," [...] or the [...] "Newcomes," [...] in his lap and if a writer can give you a sweet soothing, harmless sleep, has he not done you a kindness? So is the author who excites and interests you worthy of your thanks and benedictions. I am troubled with fever and ague, that seizes me at odd intervals and prostrates me for a day. There is cold fit, for which, I am thankful to say, hot brandy-and-water is prescribed, and this induces hot fit, and so on. In one or two of these fits I have read novels with the most fearful contentment of mind. Once, on the Mississippi, it was my dearly beloved [...] "Jacob Faithful:" [...] once at Frankfort O. M., the delightful [...] "Vingt Ans Apres" [...] of Monsieur Dumas: once at Tunbridge wells, the thrilling [...] "Woman in White:" [...] and these books gave me amusement from morning till sunset. I remember those ague fits {{with a great deal of}} pleasure and gratitude. Think of a whole day in bed, and a good novel for a companion! No cares: no remorse about idleness: no visitors: and the Woman in White or the Chevalier d'Artagnan to tell me stories from dawn to night! [...] "Please, ma'am, my master's compliments, and can he have the third volume?" [...] (This message was sent to an astonished friend and neighbor who lent me, volume by volume, the W. in W.) How do you like your novels? I like mine strong, [...] "hot with," [...] and no mistake: no love-making: no observations about society: little dialogue, except where the characters are bullying each other: plenty of fighting: and a villain in the cupboard, who is to suffer tortures just before Finis. I don't like your melancholy Finis. I never read the history of a consumptive heroine twice. If I might give a short hint to an impartial writer (as the Examiner used to say in old days), it would be to act, NOT a la mode le pays de Pole (I think that was the phraseology), but ALWAYS to give quarter. In the story of Philip, just come to an end, I have the permission of the author to state, that he was going to drown the two villains of the piece--a certain Doctor F---- and a certain Mr. T. H---- on board the [...] "President," [...] or some other tragic ship--but you see I relented. I pictured to myself Firmin's ghastly face amid the crowd of shuddering people on that reeling deck in the lonely ocean, and thought, [...] "Thou ghastly lying wretch, thou shalt not be drowned: thou shalt have a fever only; a knowledge of thy danger; and a chance--ever so small a chance--of repentance." [...] I wonder whether he DID repent when he found himself in the yellow-fever, in Virginia? The probability is, he fancied that his son had injured him very much, and forgave him on his death-bed. Do you imagine there is a great deal of genuine right-down remorse in the world? Don't people rather find excuses which make their minds easy; endeavor to prove to themselves that they have been lamentably belied and misunderstood; and try and forgive the persecutors who WILL present that bill when it is due; and not bear malice against the cruel ruffian who takes them to the police-office for stealing the spoons? Years ago I had a quarrel with a certain well-known person (I believed a statement regarding him which his friends imparted to me, and which turned out to be quite incorrect). To his dying day that quarrel was never quite made up. I said to his brother, [...] "Why is your brother's soul still dark against me? It is I who ought to be angry and unforgiving: for I was in the wrong." [...] In the region which they now inhabit (for Finis has been set to the volumes of the lives of both here below), if they take any cognizance of our squabbles, and tittle-tattles, and gossips on earth here, I hope they admit that my little error was not of a nature unpardonable. If you have never committed a worse, my good sir, surely the score against you will not be heavy. Ha, dilectissimi fratres! It is in regard of sins NOT found out that we may say or sing (in an undertone, in a most penitent and lugubrious minor key), Miserere nobis miseris peccatoribus.|$|E

To what extent have these words, written in the 1920 s, been taken seriously by succeeding bands of missionaries and mission agencies in India? This study looks at a relatively new form of missionary activity in India, trans-border televangelism brought about by satellite technology. There are currently four 24 -hour Christian networks that feature televangelists in India. This openness is remarkable in light of growing tensions between Hindu militant groups and Christian missionaries and the deeply negative accusations levelled at the church that conversion to Christianity is part of an 2 ̆ 7 international conspiracy 2 ̆ 7 to divide India (Dalrymple 1999 : 20). Ninety-ﬁve percent of all Indian televangelism programmes are based on the genre of 2 ̆ 7 straight preaching 2 ̆ 7, that is, they are mainly 15 – 20 minute sermons recorded during Church services or crusades and edited for television broadcast.

40|$|The {{personal}} {{network of}} Abu Gar, one man involved in last January 2 ̆ 7 s terrorist attack in Jakarta, {{shows how the}} communal conflicts in Ambon and Poso continue to haunt Indonesia. This latest report from the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC), traces the violent trajectory of one man, Nazaruddin Mochtar alias Abu Gar, from his decision to join the Ambon conflict in 1999  to his arrest {{in connection with the}} Jakarta attack seventeen years later. “Bonds forged in the Ambon and Poso fighting continue to provide recruits, ideological reinforcement, protection and sometimes financial support for the extremist movement,” says Sidney Jones, IPAC director. Abu Gar was involved in Ambon with the organization KOMPAK; trained fighters in Poso in 2000 - 2001; became a follower in Jakarta of extremist cleric Aman Abdurrahman in 2003; was arrested for teaching a bomb-making class for Aman’s followers in 2004; spent seven years in prison and returned to Ambon when he got out; and became the head of military affairs for Indonesia’s largest pro-ISIS organization in 2015.   At crucial steps along the way, he turned to men he had taught or trained with in Ambon and Poso. Some are in prison; several others are now in Syria. The report also asks whether any interventions, governmental or non-governmental, could have pulled Abu Gar away from violence or reduced his influence over others. There were potential opportunities after his initial arrest on terrorism charges in 2004; during his years of incarceration; after his release in 2011; or after he was identified as participating in a key ISIS Indonesia meeting in November 2015. Now that he is back in custody, there may be another chance. “Abu Gar {{is exactly the kind of}} high-risk detainee who needs to be the focus of sustained attention by Indonesian authorities,” <b>says</b> <b>Jones.</b> “The first step is to prevent his access to a smart phone. ...|$|E
