40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the hot DA white dwarf GI 91 -B 2 B {{have been unable to}} {{determine}} whether the observed soft X-ray and EUV opacity arises from a <b>stratified</b> <b>hydrogen</b> and helium atmosphere or from the presence of trace metals in the photosphere. New EUV and soft X-ray photometry of this star, made with the ROSAT observatory, when analyzed in conjunction with the earlier data, shows that the stratified models cannot account for the observed fluxes. Consequently, we conclude that trace metals must be a substantial source of opacity in the photosphere of G 191 -B 2 B...|$|E

He {{realized}} that the atmospheres of white dwarfs should be gravitationally <b>stratified,</b> with <b>hydrogen</b> on top and heavier elements below,, ยง5 - 6 and explained pressure ionization in white dwarf atmospheres. [...] He {{was one of the}} proponents of the wave heating theory of the solar corona. Schatzman proposed the mechanism of magnetic braking, by which outflows slow down the stellar rotation.|$|R
40|$|AbstractComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{models are}} {{maturing}} into useful tools for supporting safety analyses. This paper investigates {{the capabilities of}} CFD models for predicting hydrogen stratification in a containment vessel {{using data from the}} NEA/OECD SETH 2 MISTRA experiments. Further simulations are then carried out to illustrate the qualitative effects of hydrogen stratification on the performance of Passive Autocatalytic Recombiner (PAR) units. The MISTRA experiments have well-defined initial and boundary conditions which makes them well suited for use in a validation study. Results are presented for the sensitivity to mesh resolution and mesh type. Whilst the predictions are shown to be largely insensitive to the mesh resolution they are surprisingly sensitive to the mesh type. In particular, tetrahedral meshes are found to induce small unphysical convection currents that result in molecular diffusion and turbulent mixing being under-predicted. This behaviour is not unique to the CFD model used here (ANSYS CFX) and furthermore, it may affect simulations run on other non-aligned meshes (meshes that are not aligned perpendicular to gravity), including non-aligned structured meshes. Following existing best practice guidelines can help to identify potential unphysical predictions, but as an additional precaution consideration should be given to using gravity-aligned meshes for modelling stratified flows. CFD simulations of hydrogen recombination in the Becker Technologies THAI facility are presented with high and low PAR positions and homogeneous and <b>stratified</b> initial <b>hydrogen</b> distributions. For the <b>stratified</b> initial <b>hydrogen</b> distribution, as expected, the high PAR location performs better than the low positioned PAR. However, for the homogeneous initial hydrogen distribution, the low PAR location performs better than the high PAR. The work demonstrates that CFD can be a useful tool to help inform the positioning of PAR units, which may provide a practicable risk-reduction measure for situations where hydrogen releases are possible...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of axial jet-induced mixing on the pressure reduction of a thermally <b>stratified</b> liquid <b>hydrogen</b> tank. The tank was nearly cylindrical, having a volume of about 0. 144 cu m with 0. 559 m in diameter and 0. 711 m length. A mixer/pump unit, which had a jet nozzle outlet of 0. 0221 m in diameter was located 0. 178 m from the tank bottom and was installed inside the tank to generate the axial jet mixing and tank fluid circulation. Mixing tests began with the tank pressures at which the thermal stratification results in 4. 9 - 6. 2 K liquid subcooling. The mixing time and transient vapor condensation rate at the liquid-vapor interface are determined. Two mixing time correlations, based on the thermal equilibrium and pressure equilibrium, are developed and expressed as functions of system and buoyancy parameters. The limited liquid hydrogen data {{of the present study}} shows that the modified steady state condensation rate correlation may be used to predict the transient condensation rate in a mixing process if the instantaneous values of jet sub cooling and turbulence intensity at the interface are employed...|$|R
40|$|Future {{requirements}} for emission reduction from combustion engines in ground vehicles might {{be met by}} using the HCCI combustion concept. In this concept {{a more or less}} homogenous air fuel mixture is compressed to auto ignition. This gives good fuel consumption compared to a normal SI engine and its ability to burn lean mixtures at low temperatures has a positive impact on exhaust emissions. However, there are challenges associated with this concept, for instance its limited operating range and combustion control. The objective of this work is to investigate a hybrid concept, based on a combination of HCCI combustion of n-heptane and SI combustion of hydrogen. The basic idea is to initiate HCCI combustion with a spark ignited <b>stratified</b> lean <b>hydrogen</b> mixture. To verify that the combustion sequence consists of flame front combustion followed by HCCI combustion, photographs of OH chemiluminescence from the combustion were taken. This was made in a single cylinder engine with optical access through a quartz window in the piston. The performance of the hybrid combustion was compared to that of pure HCCI combustion. Chemiluminescence images show an expanding flame front initiated by the spark plug. It is shown that the flame front propagation through the hydrogen charge can be used to expand the operating range of HCCI combustion, especially towards lower loads. The hybrid combustion concept gives greater scope for controlling the combustion than the pure HCCI concept. By varying the amount of hydrogen the crank angle when 50 % of the energy is burned, CA 50, can be phased further away from TDC...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen can {{be readily}} used in spark {{ignition}} engines as a clean alternative to fossil fuels. However, the higher burning velocity and shorter quenching distance of hydrogen compared with hydrocarbons cause a larger heat transfer from the burning gas to the combustion chamber walls. Because of this cooling loss, the thermal efficiency of hydrogen-fueled engines is sometimes {{lower than that of}} conventionally fueled engines. Therefore, reducing the cooling loss is a crucial element in improving the thermal efficiency of hydrogen combustion engines. Previous research by the author and others has proposed the direct injection stratified charge as a technique for reducing the cooling loss in hydrogen combustion and shown its effect in reducing cooling loss through experiments in a constant volume combustion vessel. However, it is known that a reduction in cooling loss does not always improve thermal efficiency due to a simultaneous increase in the exhaust heat loss. This paper explains the relation between cooling loss reduction and thermal efficiency improvements by the direct injection <b>stratified</b> charge in <b>hydrogen</b> combustion engines...|$|R
40|$|White dwarfs in {{unresolved}} pairs {{with normal}} stars (spectral type K or earlier) are invisible at optical wavelengths, {{due to the}} close proximity of the much more luminous main sequence companion. ROSAT has provided evidence {{for the existence of}} a growing sample of these hidden white dwarfs through the detection of EUV and soft X-ray emission. For companions of spectral type ~A 5 or earlier, the white dwarf can be spectroscopically identified at far-ultraviolet wavelengths by IUE. Eleven such systems had previously been found in this way from ROSAT, EUVE and IUE observations. A search for fainter, less obvious samples of these binaries is presented, and five new systems have been discovered.;Three new close, pre-CV WD+dM binaries have also been found in the ROSAT WFC survey. Intriguingly, all three degenerates are rare mixed hydrogen/helium atmosphere DAO white dwarfs. The EUVE spectrum of one of these new systems, RE J 0720 - 318, is analysed in detail. In particular, it is found that, while the optical spectrum can only be reproduced with a homogeneously mixed atmosphere, the EUVE spectrum can only be matched by a layered model, implying that the underlying structure of the white dwarf is <b>stratified.</b> The <b>hydrogen</b> layer mass of 3 x 10 - 14 M is the lowest measured for any white dwarf from EUVE spectra. In addition, an unprecedented HeI/HI ratio of ~ 1 is detected for the absorbing column along the line of sight, implying a hydrogen ionisation fraction of > 90 %, if all of this material resides in local interstellar medium. It is suggested that most of the helium lies {{in the vicinity of the}} star, possible in the form of a circumbinary disk left over from the common envelope phase. These results have important implications for our understanding of the evolutionary status of DAO white dwarfs in particular, and for post-common envelope systems in general.;A catalogue of all the detected white dwarf binaries found in the ROSAT survey is presented, with an analysis of the white dwarf mass distribution. Compared with optically selected samples, a significant excess of hot, massive objects is detected. This excess probably arises from the slower cooling rates of massive (> 0. 9 M) white dwarfs in comparison to normal mass (0. 6 M) stars...|$|R
