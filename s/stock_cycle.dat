40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} {{with one of the}} UK’s major export successes of the last century, Scotch whisky. The economics of the production process place considerable onus on firms to forecast demand for up to a decade ahead. History reveals the difficulty in achieving this, with clear cycles of over-production and under-production as firms attempt to adjust their stock portfolios. No sooner has leadership emerged to encourage a more strategic approach to the <b>stock</b> <b>cycle</b> than market forces encourage some firms to break ranks in pursuit of alternative objectives. With the industry having consolidated further following the large mergers of the late 1990 s and 2000 s, it is tempting to assume the vagaries of the past are over. Current record production and stock levels, however, are set to test this proposition as Scotch sales are now below the peak level of 2011...|$|E

The proposed framework consists of two levels; top and bottom level fractals. Fractals in the bottom level analyse demand, optimise safety stock and then transmit output to the top level fractal. Fractals in the top level investigate different replenishment frequencies to determine the optimum cycle stock for each fractal in the bottom level. The proposed conceptual framework and a hypothetical supply network are implemented and validated using mathematical modelling and Supply Chain GURU Simulation Software; in order to optimise inventory in the supply network during the demand test period.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide information on the perceived effectiveness of 56 fraud-detecting standard audit procedures normally used in <b>stock</b> and warehousing <b>cycle,</b> and to examine auditor and audit firm specific factors that influence the likelihood of detecting fraud in <b>stock</b> and warehousing <b>cycle</b> in New Zealand. We gathered data through a mail survey of New Zealand auditors in order to ascertain their opinion on the effectiveness of these audit procedures. The results suggest that relatively few (less than half) of the 56 standard audit procedures are perceived by our surveyed auditors as being more effective in detecting fraud in <b>stock</b> and warehousing <b>cycle.</b> Further, more than half of the 56 audit procedures are perceived by respondents as moderately effective in detecting fraud. Fifteen audit procedures are perceived as being less effective in detecting fraud the stock and warehousing audit cycle. A univariate analysis reveals no significant perpetual differences among our respondents on the basis of the location of their employers in New Zealand, and the type of audit firm employing them. We employed logit regression analysis to test a model to predict the likelihood of detecting fraud in <b>stock</b> and warehousing <b>cycle,</b> given certain auditor and audit firm specific factors. The results of the regression analysis suggest that size of audit firm (measured by the number of employees), auditor’s position tenure, and auditor’s years of experience are statistically significant predictors of the likelihood of detecting fraud in <b>stock</b> and warehousing <b>cycle</b> in New Zealand. Thus, the likelihood of fraud detection in stock and warehousing increases as the auditor acquires more years of auditing experience, and with the audit firms employing more members of staff...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{includes three}} chapters. The first two chapters {{focus on the}} U. S. housing market and the credit market and the third chapter emphasizes interest rate <b>cycles</b> and <b>stock</b> market <b>cycles</b> in the U. S. Chapter 2 proposes a dynamic factor model to study the U. S. housing market and the credit market separately in the last decades. The model extracts the latent unobserved state representing each market from an array of key related variables. The extracted factor from each market is compared to business cycles and to changes in monetary policy as represented by fluctuations in interest rates. I find that, firstly, there are strong correlations between the housing market, the credit market and business cycles. Secondly, these two markets are connected to changes in interest rates. Chapter 3 connects the housing market and the credit market by extending Chapter 2. This chapter uses a dynamic two-factor model to study housing market and credit market fluctuations, and their interrelationships during the recent U. S. financial crisis. I investigate whether other variables {{play an important role}} in explaining the recent crisis. The two-factor model is estimated in a unified framework, taking into consideration the role of loosening and/or tightening of loan standards in the last decades. The results indicate strong correlations between the housing market, the credit market, business cycles, and interest rates. Moreover, loosening or tightening of loan standards has significant impacts on these two markets, especially in the last decade. Chapter 4 models interest rate cycles and their relationship with financial cycles. A nonlinear two-state Markov switching model is used to obtain different regimes in interest rate <b>cycles</b> and in <b>stock</b> market <b>cycles.</b> Turning points for each cycle is established and the analysis of their lead-lag relationships is examined. The results indicate that there are strong connections between interest rate <b>cycles,</b> <b>stock</b> market <b>cycles</b> and business cycles. In particular, I find that the stock market enters a bear market phase at around the same time that the interest rate enters a high phase which is signaling the possible beginning of an economic recession...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} is to study the {{synchronization}} {{of the relationship between}} bearish stock market fluctuations and periods of economic recession in six developed countries during the period from February 1990 to May 2013. Hence, first, we have identified cyclical fluctuations of the real economy and stock market by means of an autoregressive Markov regime-switching model, in order to distinguish between boom-bust cycles of economic activity and of the stock market for each country in our sample. Second, we have tested the degree of synchronization between economic activity and <b>stock</b> market bust <b>cycles</b> by means of the concordance index. Our results confirm the existence of a strong degree of synchronization between bearish stock market periods and periods of economic depression for most countries in our studied sample.

In each <b>stocking</b> <b>cycle,</b> dry matter (DM) accumulation rates, defoliation intensity (%), grazing depth (%) and grazed horizon (cm) were evaluated.

40|$|Testing {{duration}} {{in stock}} markets concerns {{the ability to}} predict the turning points of bull and bear cycles. The Weibull renewal process {{has been used in}} previous studies to analyze duration dependence in economic and financial cycles. A goodness-of-fit test, however, shows that this model does not fit data from U.

Moreover, it measures both the long term properties of bull and bear markets, such as the tendency of the cycles to become shorter (or longer), as well as the short term effects, such as duration dependence. The results give evidence of negative duration dependence in all samples of bull markets and evidence of positive duration dependence in complete, peacetime and post WWII samples of bear markets. There is no evidence of any structural change in duration dependence after WWII in either bull or bear markets. The results show that bull and bear markets tend to get progressively shorter, but for bull markets this trend has accelerated since WWII whereas for bear markets this trend has decelerated since WWII.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore {{perceptions}} of fraud detection techniques in the <b>stock</b> and warehouse <b>cycle</b> in Barbados. Design/methodology/approach – The study uses a self-administered questionnaire, adapted and modified from Owusu-Ansah et al. The sample is comprised of 64 auditors. The study examines the perceived effectiveness of audit procedures, the influence of size of the audit firm, and the level of audit experience in the choice of specific audit procedures. Findings – The study indicates that there is a moderate to high perceived effectiveness of standard audit procedures in the detection of fraud in the <b>stock</b> and warehousing <b>cycle</b> in Barbados and that the majority of the “more effective” audit procedures can be classified as field research techniques that are more direct in obtaining evidence. It is found that auditors from larger firms reported higher means for audit procedures. There are mixed findings with respect to the significant relationship between level of auditing experience of auditors and perceived effectiveness of fraud detection techniques. The study also indicates that males consistently rated the level of effectiveness of audit procedures higher than females. Research limitations/implications – Due to the relatively small sample size, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, the findings of this study do indicate that auditing procedures in this developing country are on par with those of developed countries.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the basic {{framework of a}} comprehensive computational theory of stock market behavior, which we call Swingtum, taking multivariate stock index time series data as input, and producing probabilistic predictions of stock index movement at multiple time frames.

The Swingtum theory {{is based on the}} view that the movement of the stock market as a whole as represented by its benchmark index is driven by three types of forces: business dynamics, mass psychological dynamics, and news impacts, and consequently the market movement can be decomposed into four types of components: dynamical swings, physical cycles, abrupt momentums, and random walks. Dynamic swings include business <b>cycles,</b> <b>stock</b> life <b>cycles,</b> and Elliott waves of different levels, which typically have a fractal nature characterized by log-periodic power laws.

40|$|Based on a {{deterministic}} hypothesis, {{this paper}} aims {{to verify the}} regularity of the <b>stock</b> market <b>cycles</b> and, if this regularity is found, the ability to predict major stock market crises. Harmonic analysis, or Fourier series, is applied in order to, decomposing into sinusoids curves, find the constant periodicities hidden under the series of observed data. Starting from the industrial stock market data in the U. S., considering three periods of similar length of 165 months: 1919 : 01 to 1932 : 09, 1977 : 01 to 1999 : 09 and 1997 : 03 to 2010 : 11, I stand {{in the moment of}} maximum growth of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and I check if the most significant hidden periodicities allowed to predict the sharp drop in the index that was coming and the subsequent development. The evidence is inconclusive. A small number of theoretical cycles reasonably explain the stock market evolution. In terms of predictive power, in two cases there is this ability, while not in another. The conclusion reached indicates that, due to the regularity in the data, the application of the a deterministic hypothesis is reasonable. However, it is necessary to perform a deeper analysis of the data to be able to describe and predict major <b>stock</b> market <b>cycles,</b> including crises or large declines in stock market prices. ...|$|R

It is possible that two economies with identical "deep" parameters and initial capital <b>stocks</b> may <b>cycle</b> around different trend growth rates, depending upon the historical path of fiscal shocks. Growth and cycles interact, and the nonlinearity means that output changes cannot be decomposed into a stochastic trend and a trend-stationary process. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This paper aims to {{investigate}} Chinese bull and bear markets. The Chinese {{stock market has}} experienced {{a long period of}} bear cycle from early 2000 until 2006, and then it fluctuated greatly until 2010. However, the cyclical behaviour of stock markets during this period is less well established. This paper aims to answer the question why the Chinese stock market experienced a long duration of bear market and what factors would have impacted this cyclical behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: By comparing the intervals of bull and bear markets between stocks and indices based on a Markov switching model, this paper examines whether different industries or A- and B-share markets could lead to different stock market cyclical behaviour and whether firm size can determine the relationship between the firm <b>stock</b> <b>cycles</b> on the market cycles. Findings: This paper finds a high degree of overlapping of bear <b>cycles</b> between <b>stocks</b> and indices and a high level of overlapping between the bear market and a fraction of stock with increasing stock prices. This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} stock performance and trading behaviour are widely diversified. Furthermore, the paper finds that the same industry may have different overlapping intervals of bull or bear cycles in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets. Firms with different sizes could have different overlapping intervals with bull or bear cycles.
