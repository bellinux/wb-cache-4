500|$|According to Sally Jenkins, in her Sports Illustrated {{article on}} Carlisle:To take {{advantage}} of the Indians' versatility Warner drew up a new offense... "the Carlisle formation," [...] but later it would be known as the single wing. It was predicated on one small move: Warner shifted a halfback out wide, to outflank the opposing tackle, forming <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a wing. It opened up a world of possibilities. The Indians could line up as if to punt – and then throw. No one would know whether they were going to run, pass or kick. For added measure Warner taught his quarterbacks to sprint out a few yards to their left or their right, buying more time to throw. The rest of the players flooded downfield and knocked down any opponent who might be able to intercept or bat away the pass.|$|E
500|$|Art {{designer}} Sylvain Despretz {{claimed the}} art department {{was assigned to}} create something that had {{little or nothing to}} do with the Superman comic book, and also explained that Peters [...] "would bring kids in, who would rate the drawings on the wall as if they were evaluating the toy possibilities. It was basically a toy show." [...] Peters saw a cover of National Geographic, containing a picture of a skull, going to art department workers, telling them he wanted the design for Brainiac's space ship to have the same image. Burton gave Despretz a concept drawing for Brainiac, which Despretz claims was [...] "a cone with a round ball on top, and <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> an emaciated skull inside. Imagine you take Merlin's hat, and you stick a fish bowl on top, with a skull in it." [...] Concept artist Rolf Mohr said in an interview he designed a suit for the Eradicator for a planned scene in which it transforms into a flying vehicle.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the thrall girl {{went from}} one tent {{to the other}} and had sexual {{intercourse}} with the men. Every man told her: [...] "Tell your master that I did this because of my love to him". In the afternoon, they moved the thrall girl to <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a door frame, where she was lifted on the palms of the men three times. Every time, the girl told them what she saw. The first time, she saw her father and mother, the second time, she saw all her relatives, and the third time she saw her master in the afterworld. There, it was green and beautiful and together with him, she saw men and young boys. She saw that her master beckoned for her. By using intoxicating drinks, they thought to put the thrall girl in an ecstatic trance that made her psychic and through the symbolic action with the door frame, she would then see into the realm of the dead. The same ritual also appears in the Icelandic short story [...] "Völsa þáttr," [...] where two pagan Norwegian men lift the lady of the household over a door frame to help her look into the otherworld.|$|E

500|$|Tim Miller, {{creative}} {{director for the}} title sequence, wanted to develop an abstract narrative that reflected the pivotal moments in the novel, {{as well as the}} character development of Lisbeth Salander. It was arduous for Miller to conceptualize the sequence abstractly, given that Salander's occupation was a distinctive part of her personality. His initial ideas were modeled after a keyboard. [...] "We were going to treat the keyboard like this giant city with massive fingers pressing down on the keys," [...] Miller explained, [...] "Then we transitioned to the liquid going through the giant obelisks of the keys." [...] Among Miller's many vignettes was [...] "The Hacker Inside", which revealed the character's inner disposition and melted them away. The futuristic qualities in the original designs provided for a much more cyberpunk appearance than the final product. In creating the [...] "cyber" [...] look for Salander, Miller said, [...] "Every time I would show David a design he would say, 'More Tandy!' It's the shitty little computers from Radio Shack, the Tandy computers. They probably had vacuum tubes in them, really old technology. And David would go 'More Tandy', until we ended up with <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> we glued a bunch of computer parts found at a junkyard together." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{follows from}} the causal theory of reference. Words always refer {{to the kinds of}} things they were coined to refer to, thus the kinds of things their user, or the user's ancestors, {{experience}}d. So, if some person, Mary, were a [...] "brain in a vat", whose every experience is received through wiring and other gadgetry created by the [...] "mad scientist", then Mary's idea of a [...] "brain" [...] would not refer to a [...] "real" [...] brain, since she and her linguistic community have never seen such a thing. Rather, she saw <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a brain, but was actually an image fed to her through the wiring. Similarly, her idea of a [...] "vat" [...] would not refer to a [...] "real" [...] vat. So, if, as a brain in a vat, she were to say [...] "I'm a brain in a vat", she would actually be saying [...] "I'm a brain-image in a vat-image", which is incoherent. On the other hand, if she is not a brain in a vat, then saying that she is a brain in a vat is still incoherent, but now because she actually means the opposite. This is a form of epistemological externalism: knowledge or justification depends on factors outside the mind and is not solely determined internally.|$|E

60|$|The Arab {{said this}} so earnestly--at {{the same time}} {{producing}} a sixpence, or <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> one, from his pockets--that the provincial boy's rising suspicions were quite disarmed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well then, to {{show how}} right you are, there's the young lady." [...] He pointed to an object {{on one of the}} tables, a small {{photograph}} with a very wide border of <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> crimson fur.|$|E
60|$|Then Bickley {{discovered}} <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> {{the mouth}} of a well down which he nearly tumbled, and Bastin began to complain that he was hot and very thirsty; also to point out that he wished for no more caves and idols at present.|$|E
6000|$|While {{they waited}} and talked, Paula still observing the storks, the hotel omnibus came {{round the corner}} from the station. 'I believe he has arrived,' resumed Miss De Stancy; 'I see <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> his {{portmanteau}} {{on the top of the}} omnibus.... Yes; it is his baggage. I'll run down to him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{believe your}} {{explanation}} is right; they are, {{under certain conditions}} of light, thrown by a tree that grows some distance off.

6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} would have, laddie, when I saw you getting away with the liquid last night. An X-ray {{photograph}} of your liver would show <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a crumpled oak-leaf studded with hob-nails. You ought to take more exercise, dear heart. Except for sloshing that policeman, you haven't done anything athletic for years." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{opened the}} linen case, which was, by the bye, secured by a padlock, and drew out what was, to all appearance, an {{ordinary}} fishing-rod, fitted {{at the end}} with <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> an iron hand. Peter Ruff dropped it through the hole until it reached the table, moved it backwards and forwards, and turned round with a smile.|$|E
6000|$|The {{words had}} {{scarcely}} been uttered when there {{came from the}} interior of the steam yacht a dull explosion. Then, of a sudden, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a bunch of rockets flew up into the air. With a loud hissing and with sparks flying in all directions, the bunch of rockets described a graceful curve and then headed directly for the deck of the Eaglet! ...|$|E
50|$|A police blimp {{is flying}} over Gotham City. A blip ghosts across the radar screen, then the pilot sees <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> bat wings fly past the cockpit window.

50|$|The {{police force}} the other twin {{to lead them}} to his brother, but he escapes the police. Holmes finds the killer and his victim just in time; the young woman has a silk {{stocking}} tied around her neck, and Watson has to cut it and perform <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> CPR. Holmes gets the killer twin to confess that he wanted his victims' attention, because they looked at him while in captivity. Both twins are then taken into custody.|$|R

60|$|The route was {{now over}} a dense woods {{and the boys}} had to sail slowly, for fear of passing the {{automobile}} while the latter was running under the overhanging trees. Once they saw <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> an automobile and Dick had to sail {{in a circle and}} come back, to make sure. But it proved to be only a two-seated carriage; and they passed on.|$|E
6000|$|Seymour looked troubled for {{the first}} time. [...] "It is hardly a point of fact," [...] he said, [...] "but if his lordship would like me to answer for my impression, of course I shall do so. There was {{something}} about the thing that was not exactly a woman and yet was not quite a man; somehow the curves were different. And it had <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> long hair." ...|$|E
60|$|The day passed swiftly, in intense watchfulness on {{the part}} of the defenders, and in a waiting game {{on the part}} of the besiegers. They kept up a {{desultory}} firing all afternoon. Now and then a reckless grader running from post to post drew a volley from the Sioux; and likewise <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> an Indian would call forth shots from the defenses. But there was no real fighting.|$|E
5000|$|The two 1 bits will {{be added}} even if {{the length of the}} message is already {{divisible}} by r.

2500|$|Some pundits {{found the}} need to {{distinguish}} Boman from the former National Hockey League Coach, William Scott Bowman, who was also known as [...] "Scotty Bowman". [...] A photo of the banner from his website appeared in the Detroit Free Press with the caption: [...] "Scotty Boman, a Libertarian candidate in Michigan's senatorial race, {{is not related to}} THE Scotty Bowman.

5|$|Workmen {{discover}} a pre-human skull while {{building in the}} fictional Hobbs Lane (formerly Hob's Lane, Hob being an antiquated name for the Devil) in Knightsbridge, London. Dr Matthew Roney, a paleontologist, examines the remains and reconstructs a dwarf-like humanoid with a large brain volume, which he believes to be a primitive man. As further excavation is undertaken, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> a missile is unearthed; further work by Roney's group is halted because the military {{believe it to be}} an unexploded Second World War bomb.|$|R
60|$|He {{shook his}} bridle and rode on, whilst Leland stood {{a minute or}} two {{watching}} the others straggle out along the trail. Last of all a trooper led a horse which carried an amorphous burden wrapped in a fur coat, and lashed on with a pack-lariat. <b>Something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a moccasined foot trailed down on one side in the snow, and, judging from the trouble the beast gave its driver, it did not like what it carried.|$|E
60|$|One {{morning the}} prince {{and his dog}} were out as usual, and in chasing their game they drew near {{the bank of the}} river. The prince was running at full speed after his dog when he almost fell over <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a log of wood, which was lying in his path. To his {{surprise}} a voice spoke to him, and he saw that the thing which he had taken for a branch was really a crocodile.|$|E
60|$|But what of {{the people}} on shore when this terrible scene was being enacted? They were not entirely ignorant of it. Through driving sleet and spray they had seen in the thick {{darkness}} <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> a vessel in distress. Soon the spectral object was seen to advance more distinctly out of the gloom. Well did the fishermen know what that meant, and, procuring ropes, they hastened to the rescue, while spray, foam, sand, and even small pebbles, were swept up by the wild hurricane and dashed in their faces.|$|E

5000|$|Why is it we {{have the}} ugliest money of all civilized nations? The design is poor, commonplace, tasteless, characterless, and the {{execution}} is like thereunto.
