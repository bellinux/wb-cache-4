50|$|But {{there is}} another side to the story. Given that almost all crops are seasonal, {{ensuring}} round-the-clock supply requires adequate build-up of stocks during the season. So, it {{may not always be}} possible to differentiate between genuine <b>stock</b> <b>build-up</b> and speculative hoarding. Also, there can be genuine shortages triggered by weather-related disruptions in which case prices will move up. So, if prices are always monitored, farmers may have no incentive to farm.|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to clarify}} the {{performance}} attributes of logistical service that retailers identify as more relevant to their suppliers’ distribution process in urban areas. And, this task was performed using the Stated Preference Technique, a tool not so widespread among operations management researchers. The research focused the small retail food stores in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, considering the complexity involved {{in the delivery of}} perishable and fragile foods. As result, the technique show us the relative importance of the attributes related to the service level, highlighting the high degree of relevance achieved by the attributes that define the service level. This means that gaps in services are not easily shadowed by compensatory practices of <b>stock</b> <b>build-up,</b> which are financially very burdensome or unviable in terms of storage area. This kind of approach may call attention to opportunities of improving buyer-supplier relationships and the management of these processes, as well as public issues.

40|$|Forecasting {{levels of}} stocks held by {{manufacturing}} industry is problematic. Stocks {{are the most}} volatile component of GDP. The data itself is subject to chronic revision. Yet, forecasting inventory changes in the supply chain is crucial for firms trying to manage output. The paper reports a successful approach to forecasting UK manufacturing stock behaviour sponsored by a leading European metals manufacturer. The model exploits the seasonality of <b>stock</b> <b>build-ups</b> and run-downs. (Existing econometric approaches rely on seasonally adjusted data.) The forecasting performance of our model is compared to alternative time series approaches. Use of raw, unadjusted data implies markedly different specifications {{from those in the}} established literature. In particular, we find no significant evidence of a structural break in UK stockholding behaviour in our sample period and the absence of cointegration between stocks and output suggests the conventional error correction approach is spurious, as well as giving poor forecasts.

50|$|After the Baker entered service, more {{modifications}} {{were made}} to the rifle and several different variations were produced. A lighter and shorter carbine version for the cavalry was introduced, and a number of volunteer associations procured their own models, including the Duke of Cumberland's Corps of Sharpshooters, which ordered models with a 33-inch barrel, in August 1803. A second pattern of Baker Rifle was fitted with a 'Newland' lock that had a flat-faced ring neck cock. In 1806, a third pattern was produced that included a 'pistol grip' style trigger guard and a smaller patchbox with a plain rounded front. The lock plate was smaller, flat, and had a steeped-down tail, a raised semi-waterproof pan, a flat ring neck cock, and a sliding safety bolt. With the introduction of a new pattern Short Land Pattern Flintlock Musket ('Brown Bess') in 1810, with its flat lock and ring-necked cock, the Baker's lock followed suit for what became the fourth pattern. It also featured a 'slit stock'—the stock had a slot cut in its underpart just over a quarter-inch wide. This was done after Ezekiel Baker had seen reports of the ramrod jamming in the <b>stock</b> after the <b>build-up</b> of residue in the ramrod channel, and when the wood warped after getting wet.|$|R
