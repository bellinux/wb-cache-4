40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{influence}} of time convenience on shopping behaviour in the light of a time <b>scarcity</b> <b>phenomenon</b> that is reported to have reached epidemic proportions in many markets. Design/methodology/approach - The paper begins with a survey of consumer households, examining the importance shoppers assign to time convenience. This is followed by a supply-side comparison of malls and shopping strips against the attributes of time convenience. Findings - The results indicate that time convenience has a salient influence on consumers&# 039; patronage behaviour, and that malls and strips differ in their provision of this key attribute. Practical implications - Retail planners must give serious thought to creating retail environments that allow shoppers to "buy" time. Providing time convenience via one-stop shopping, extended trading hours, proximity to home or work and enclosure offers one such strategy for the shopping mall and shopping strip. Originality/value - The focus on convenience provides practitioners with a strategic alternative to hedonic strategies. It is also one of the first studies to investigate retail centre patronage from both a demand-and supply-side perspective...|$|E
40|$|The Pilot Arno Water Accounts (PAWA) {{project was}} {{recently}} funded under the Call “Preparatory Action on Development of Prevention Activities to Halt Desertification in Europe” of the Directorate- General for the Environment of the European Commission to promote preventive actions to manage water <b>scarcity</b> and drought <b>phenomena</b> {{and to meet}} {{one of the main}} goals under European environmental legislation: the effective and sustainable management of water resources. The partners involved in the implementation of the PAWA project (ISPRA, Arno River Basin Authority, SEMIDE/EMWIS) will carry out a pilot initiative in the Arno River Basin, an area severely affected by water <b>scarcity</b> and droughts <b>phenomena</b> and characterized by water withdrawals and land use changes. In the area a large experience about water balance application was already performed, for example {{in the context of the}} Water Framework Directive Common Implementation Strategy. Moving from this knowledge, the objective of the project is the definition of water accounting processing based on the UN System of Environmental Economic Accounts for Water, with the final goal to optimize a list of effective measures to face water <b>scarcity</b> <b>phenomena.</b> By the end of project (March 2015) the PAWA partnership aims at preparing physical water stock accounts, using the best available data resulting from field measurements or models, on a monthly step for the period 1999 – 201. The quality of each dataset will be assessed; tables, maps and graphs will be produced as outputs of the projects in cooperation with local stakeholders and players of the water sector. Furthermore, water accounts will be used to assess the potential impact of various measures related to water resource efficient exploitation in the most vulnerable sub-basins; their tolerability will be tested during workshops with stakeholders. Finally, water efficiency targets for potential future integration into Arno River Basin Management Plan will be identified...|$|R
40|$|Global Climate Change (GCC) and its {{attributed}} water <b>scarcity</b> <b>phenomena</b> under arid and semi-arid conditions lead {{to decrease}} water income per capita {{and increase the}} water challenges allover the counterpart systems in general and agricultural systems in particular. Moreover, landscaping projects are considered as enhanced water consumptive use more than on farm projects. In addition, scheduling irrigation {{plays a crucial role}} in increasing water uses in the agricultural system, but it needs a highly qualified technique and attributed management practices to achieve its objectives. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the irrigation water and energy savings in landscaping under different irrigation scheduling techniques. Results revealed that scheduling practices based on the actual instantaneous microclimate data based on fully automated turf irrigation systems by using weather station could maximize the irrigation water use efficiency and enhance the irrigation water amount saving by about 43. 74 % more than the traditional ways of scheduling, either that based on the design concepts and background or that based on the average values observed by Central Laboratory of Agricultural Climate (CLAC). In addition, data revealed that application of recent scheduling techniques can save about 36. 7 % and 62 % of the seasonally operational costs and energy requirements, respectively...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis study {{reports a}} case of partial {{albinism}} in Rhinelepis aspera from the Aguapeí River, Upper Paraná Basin, Brazil and provides a review of albinism cases in freshwater fishes from South America. The captured specimen has depigmentation throughout almost its entire body, with pigmented eyes and little dark spots on the dorsal and caudal fins. It is an adult male, and we suggest that due to the benthic habitat, it {{would be able to}} reach adult size, avoiding predators. The review shows a <b>scarcity</b> of this <b>phenomenon</b> in nature...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to an institutional theory of crime. More specifically, {{it focuses on}} the problem of the Mafia and the infiltration of legitimate businesses. In legal markets, the Mafia resorts to artificial scarcity as a functioning principle. Although scarcity and its consequences for market economies are key aspects of mainstream economics, they have been insufficiently analyzed because the emphasis is only on 'natural' <b>scarcity.</b> The Mafia <b>phenomenon</b> reveals that <b>scarcity</b> can also be institutionally created. This type of scarcity encourages the process of market collectivization and empowers those generating it. The Mafia's legal activities establish a system of waiting-lines and monitored access to goods. Instead of being merely coercive and openly violent, the Mafia builds a new lasting order, producing its own rules and even breeding social legitimacy...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss the {{possible}} conditions for the emergence or containment of collective youth violence in two African capitals (Bissau and Praia) focusing on young people’s (re) actions to economic and social marginality. The visibility of violent groups in Praia – capital of a ‘model African country’ – contrasts with the apparent <b>scarcity</b> of these <b>phenomena</b> in Bissau – capital of an economically stagnant and politically unstable country. In this paper, we argue that more than looking at traditional theories that relate violence to poverty or social anomie, it is necessary to analyze, on the one hand, the role of social inequality in sustaining violence and, on the other hand, the degree of acceptance of the marginalization and social destiny by the young...|$|R
40|$|Water <b>scarcity</b> is a <b>phenomenon</b> {{of great}} concern at the {{international}} level. Climate change has significant impacts on water access, causing long dry period or intense precipitation, floods and drought. In the brief analysis, it will be proved through States’ practice {{that the right to}} water has almost achieved the status of a customary international norm as an independent human right, thus creating obligations upon all States. Considering the relation between water and climate change, it will be argued that the human right to water may be integrated in the adaptation measures provided for by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, even though the human rights and climate change regimes are distinct. The practice in climate change adaptation measures which consider the necessity of granting the access to water to the population is an element which supports the existence of an international custom recognizing the right to water as an independent human right. At the same time, however, this international custom may imply the development of a human rights-based approach in matters concerning climate change...|$|R

Despite the {{popularity}} of coreference resolution as a research topic, {{the overwhelming majority of}} the work in this area focused so far on single antecedence coreference only. Multiple antecedent coreference (MAC) has been largely neglected. This can be explained by the <b>scarcity</b> of the <b>phenomenon</b> of MAC in generic discourse. However, in specialized discourse such as patents, MAC is very dominant. It seems thus unavoidable to address the problem of MAC resolution in the context of tasks related to automatic patent material processing, among them abstractive summarization, deep parsing of patents, construction of concept maps of the inventions, etc. We present the first version of an operational rule-based MAC resolution strategy for patent material that covers the three major types of MAC: (i) nominal MAC, (ii) MAC with personal / relative pronouns, and MAC with reflexive / reciprocal pronouns. The evaluation shows that our strategy performs well in terms of precision and recall. The research reported in this paper has been carried out in the scope of the iPatDoc project, which was funded by the European Commision under the contract number FP 7 -SME- 606163...|$|R
