5|$|Novelists {{influenced}} by Blyton include the crime writer Denise Danks, whose fictional detective Georgina Powers {{is based on}} George from the Famous Five. Peter Hunt's A <b>Step</b> <b>off</b> the Path (1985) is also {{influenced by}} the Famous Five, and the St. Clare's and Malory Towers series provided the inspiration for Jacqueline Wilson's Double Act (1996) and Adèle Geras's Egerton Hall trilogy (1990–92) respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Faculty of Medicine {{remained}} the school's only functioning faculty until 1843 when the Faculty of Arts commenced {{teaching in the}} newly constructed Arts Building and East Wing (Dawson Hall). The university also historically has strong linkage with The Canadian Grenadier Guards, a military regiment in which James McGill served as the Lieutenant-Colonel. This title is marked upon the stone that stands before the Arts building, from where the Guards <b>step</b> <b>off</b> annually to commemorate Remembrance Day.|$|E
5|$|In the end, the Australians were {{detected}} while waiting to <b>step</b> <b>off</b> and, after being illuminated by flares and taking fire from a German picquet, hastily launched the attack. After overcoming this, the left-centre company, having lost {{all of their}} officers, lost their formation {{and had to be}} re-organised before the attack on {{the eastern side of the}} village could continue. The two companies passed through hedges and the ruined buildings, clearing the outskirts of the village with little resistance. The left-most company then began its task of establishing outposts to the east. At the same time, on the right, the right-most company had advanced to the Doignes–Hermies road when they had begun to take fire. Overcoming this and skirting a wire obstacle, they began moving towards the rear of the German main defence line. At this point, they came under fire from a low hill on the western outskirts of the village, which took them in the flank and pinned them on its slope. In the darkness, the location of the enemy machine-gun could not be ascertained initially. The Australians remained fixed there for almost an hour-and-a-half before members of the right centre company, who had avoided most of the German resistance, were able to locate it and destroy it from the rear just before dawn. The two centre companies were then able to enter the village proper, forcing large numbers of the garrison to try to escape to the north-east, where they were taken prisoner in large numbers. Here the left-most company had been establishing a number of posts in the open fields. Most of these were established with minimal resistance, however, one platoon became heavily engaged by a machine-gun positioned near a sandpit on the other side of a road. A small group of men crossed the road and attempted to provide covering fire for the platoon. Amongst this group was Private Bede Kenny who, under heavy fire, rushed the enemy position and destroyed it with grenades, taking the surviving Germans prisoner. For his actions, he was later awarded the Victoria Cross. Minor skirmishing continued after this, but by 6:00am the village had been captured and 200 prisoners taken, for a loss to the 2nd Battalion of eight officers and 173 other ranks killed or wounded.|$|E

25|$|On {{the second}} day of the Battle of Gettysburg, July 2, 1863, McLaws {{commanded}} the second division to <b>step</b> <b>off</b> in Longstreet's massive assault on the Union left flank. He achieved great success (at a high cost in lives) in the areas known as the Wheatfield and the Peach Orchard, but the army as a whole was unable to dislodge the Union forces from their positions on Cemetery Ridge. His division did not participate in Pickett's Charge the next day, despite Longstreet's command of that assault.|$|E

25|$|In December 1972, {{as one of}} {{the crew}} on board Apollo 17, Schmitt became the first member of NASA's first {{scientist-astronaut}} group to fly in space. As Apollo 17 was the last of the Apollo missions, he also became the twelfth and second youngest person to set foot on the Moon, and the second-to-last person to <b>step</b> <b>off</b> of the Moon (he boarded the Lunar Module shortly before commander Eugene Cernan). Schmitt also remains the first and only professional scientist to have flown beyond low Earth orbit and to have visited the Moon. He was influential within the community of geologists supporting the Apollo program and, before starting his own preparations for an Apollo mission, {{had been one of the}} scientists training those Apollo astronauts chosen to visit the lunar surface.|$|E
25|$|He first gained {{prominence}} in November 1953 when he tracked down the former Thomas C. Buntin and his wife. The bizarre case involved {{the son of}} a wealthy Nashville business owner who had disappeared in September 1931, followed six weeks later by the disappearance of his secretary. Seigenthaler was sent to Texas by The Tennessean after reports surfaced that Buntin (now known as Thomas D. Palmer) was living somewhere in the Lone Star state. After a series of dead-ends, Seigenthaler struck pay dirt in Orange, Texas, where he saw an elderly man <b>step</b> <b>off</b> a bus. Noting the man's distinctive left ear, Seigenthaler followed him home. After three further days of investigation, {{he went back to the}} home, where he confirmed the identities of Buntin/Palmer, his wife, the former Betty McCuddy, and their six children. Seigenthaler won a National Headliner Award for the story.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the night}} of 12/13 November, the Marines' orders were {{modified}} to {{increase the size of}} the patrol to two companies, with a headquarters element and an artillery forward observer team to control fire support. It was also decided to expedite the establishment of the outpost at the junction of the East–West and Numa Numa Trails. In view of the importance of his assignment, Colonel Evans Ames—commander of the 21st Marines—sought divisional orders to send the entire 2nd Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Eustace Smoak. This request was subsequently granted, thus enabling the US commander to maintain a company in reserve. Orders were issued for the patrol to <b>step</b> <b>off</b> early on 13 November, with Company E leading out at 06:30. They were to move to an assembly area positioned {{to the rear of the}} front line held by the 9th Marine Regiment and wait for the rest of the battalion to arrive before continuing.|$|E

25|$|On May 3, 2006, Chen {{canceled}} {{plans to}} pass through the United States on his way to Latin America. He was hoping to stop by either San Francisco or New York City to refuel and stay overnight, but the US refused his request instead limiting him to a brief refuelling stopover in Anchorage, Alaska where Chen {{would not be allowed to}} <b>step</b> <b>off</b> the plane. Chen and Taiwan saw this as a snub and led to Chen's cancellation. The trip to Latin America will continue, however, without a US stopover. The US State Department claimed that the Alaska stopover offer was consistent with its previous accommodations. However, former Taiwan president Lee Teng-hui was granted a visit to Cornell University eleven years ago. More recently, in addition, Taiwan's leaders have in general been granted permission to stopover in the United States for brief periods before continuing on to other countries. This recent American stance is interpreted by Taiwan to be an expression of the increasing irritation the United States feels towards Taiwan and Chen's seemingly pro-independence gestures. Chen attended the inauguration of Óscar Arias, the president of Costa Rica, one of the few countries that recognized the Republic of China at that time. Laura Bush was also present to represent U.S. president George W. Bush. Chen seized the opportunity, approached her and shook her hands, while Chen's aide produced a camera immediately for an impromptu photo-op. Chen's supporters saw this act as a step forward in Taiwan's struggle for diplomatic recognition, while his detractors claimed that it was a grave breach of international etiquette and put Taiwan to shame.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{world and}} {{characters}} were designed primarily by Gilbert. After having read Tim Powers' historical fantasy novel On Stranger Tides, {{he decided to}} add paranormal themes to the game's plot. He also cited Powers' book as an influence on the characters, particularly those of Guybrush and LeChuck. Inspiration for the game's ambiance came from Gilbert's favorite childhood amusement park ride, Pirates of the Caribbean. Grossman said that Gilbert always wanted [...] "to <b>step</b> <b>off</b> the ride" [...] and [...] "talk {{to the people who}} lived in that world". Near the final stages of the design work, Gilbert introduced several characters who were not directly related to the game's story. He considered this to be an important decision, as the player would need those seemingly minor characters in later parts of the game and would receive a chance to [...] "really interact with them".|$|E
500|$|The halftime drill always {{begins with}} the band running into place at the command of the drum major's whistle.

[...] A whoop and cheers come from the audience. The drum majors then march out in front of the band and the head drum major calls the band to attention and vocally gives directions to the band, referencing the composition of the Aggie War Hymn, by shouting, [...] "Recall! <b>Step</b> <b>off</b> on Hullabaloo!" [...] (Recall is a traditional Army bugle call – the first 34 notes, and intro of the Aggie War Hymn. [...] "Hullabaloo" [...] is the first word sung in the Aggie War Hymn.) These directions are not amplified in any way, but can be heard across the entire stadium. After another whoop, the drum majors signal for the horns to be lifted into playing position with two quick whistle blasts and the bugle rank does a flourish.|$|E

500|$|Two marches were {{organized}} in Portland. The [...] "We the People: Marching in Resistance" [...] rally included groups such as: Oregon's Union Movement, Basic Rights Oregon, Unite Oregon, and the Northwest Oregon Labor Council. The event {{was held at}} Director Park and the groups had a permit to march. Don't Shoot Portland organized a demonstration {{in front of the}} Edith Green – Wendell Wyatt Federal Building, where a small group of protestors faced off with police. This second protest did not have a permit and consisted of a couple of hundred people. The police were in riot gear and pushed the crowd out of the street. Thirteen demonstrators were arrested for blocking traffic. One protester was tackled by the police and then shot with non-lethal projectiles. One man who was reportedly [...] "one <b>step</b> <b>off</b> the curb" [...] in the street was pushed to the ground by police, had his arms pinned to his back, and was then pepper-sprayed in the face; and a woman was shoved to the sidewalk and then shot by police with [...] "pepper balls". A 66-year-old woman was also tackled and hurt by the police when she attempted to shield her 72-year-old friend from being pushed. Several of the people arrested were minors, with six young people including a 14-year-old being cited. The adults were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct in the second degree, with one man also being charged with resisting arrest and giving false information to the police.|$|E
500|$|X was {{introduced}} on the series via {{a phone call}} made to Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) in the second season episode [...] "The Host", telling Mulder that he had [...] "a friend in the FBI". However, the character did not appear on-screen until [...] "Sleepless", two episodes later, aiding Mulder in an investigation by leaking information on a secret military project from the Vietnam War. [...] While X's loyalties and his own agenda were often unclear, he proved more than once that he at least does not want Mulder dead.

Initially X refuses, and is subsequently confronted by Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who seemed to recognize X. He relinquishes Mulder's location, though not until after a brief but intense scuffle with Skinner. In the episode [...] "731", X's loyalty to Mulder is further confirmed. Trapped on a train car equipped with a time bomb, Mulder, about to escape, is attacked brutally by the Red Haired Man, a Men in Black assassin. X fatally shoots the Red Haired Man as he is about to <b>step</b> <b>off</b> the car, then boards the car with only enough time left to save either Mulder or the alien-human hybrid the car was transporting.

500|$|Following this, the division's {{next major}} {{engagement}} came on 4 October 1917 when it {{took part in}} the Battle of Broodseinde Ridge. This time the 9th Brigade was held back in reserve, while the 10th and 11th Brigades led the division forward. Attacking on the left of the Australian 2nd Division and the right of the New Zealand Division, early {{on the morning of the}} scheduled start of the attack the German artillery opened up on the division's eight assaulting infantry battalions as they stood to in the open ready to <b>step</b> <b>off.</b> Conserving their artillery for the main attack, the supporting Allied artillery only provided limited counter-battery fire and the division suffered heavily as they were forced to endure an hour-long barrage before zero hour came at 6am. As the 37th and 43rd Battalions led the advance towards the German lines, supported by small teams of mortarmen and machine gunners, the Germans launched their own attack, however, the Australian assault had taken them by surprise and after some initial resistance, the German assault troops began to fall back or surrender. As the follow-on battalions exploited the ground gained in the initial assault the advance continued and by 9:15am the 3rd Division had carried the ridge and begun to dig in, having advanced [...] A counterattack late in the day on the 11th Brigade's position was turned back, sealing a stunning success for the 3rd Division. Nevertheless, the division's casualties were high, with over 1,800 men killed or wounded. For his actions during the attack, Walter Peeler, a Lewis-gunner from the 3rd Pioneer Battalion who was attached to 37th Battalion for anti-aircraft duties received the Victoria Cross after he personally led the assault on a number of German positions.|$|E
