40|$|The {{modeling}} of <b>Sand</b> <b>Asphalt</b> and experiments to measure their rheological properties are of vital concern to many industrial processes especially highway and roadway pavement construction industry. A variety of {{hot mix asphalt}} mixtures are used in highway and runway pavement construction, with each mixture catering to a specific need. These mixtures vary in type and percentage of aggregates and asphalt used and consequently exhibit marked differences in their response. The main thrust {{of this research is}} to provide experimental data which would be helpful in determining the efficacy of the constitutive models that have been developed for these hot mix asphalt mixtures. Here we attempt to provide experimental data in the raw form for <b>Sand</b> <b>Asphalt</b> mixtures that would be helpful in the theoretical modeling efforts involving asphalt materials using a continuum point of view. For example the data obtained can be of immense help to evaluate the constitutive model developed by Murali Krishnan and Rajagopal. The <b>Sand</b> <b>Asphalt</b> mixture in their model is modeled as `homogenized' single constituent due to the peculiarity of its makeup. The constitutive model of Murali Krishnan and Rajagopal is based on a thermodynamical framework for materials possessing multiple natural configurations (multiple stress free states) to derive the constitutive equations. Recently an Orthogonal Rheometer was built to characterize the granular solids by Gupta and Rajagopal which was later used by Baek in the torsional mode. In this work we have used the same Torsional Rheometer with some minor modifications in the design to measure some general properties of <b>Sand</b> <b>Asphalt</b> mixtures. <b>Sand</b> <b>Asphalt</b> mixtures, due to their non-linear viscoelastic character, exhibit `normal stress effects' and `stress relaxation'.

A typical <b>sand</b> <b>asphalt</b> mixture sample in cylindrical shape was used as the test specimen. From this work some interesting data was obtained.

40|$|Fatigue {{cracking}} in {{asphalt concrete}} (AC) is of immense importance to pavement design and analysis {{because it is}} one of the most important forms of distress that can lead to structural failure in pavement. Once started, these types of cracks can be combined with other environmental factors leading to detrimental effects such as faster rates of pavement deterioration and shortened pavement life and functionality. Currently AASHTO TP 101, also known as linear amplitude sweep (LAS) specification, is being widely used to evaluate the ability of an asphalt binder to resist fatigue. The LAS method, although mechanistic in its approach, has certain drawbacks. First, the test is performed on an aged 2 -mm thick binder sample, which in reality may never exist in the AC where there is a varying non-uniform thickness of the binder across the components of the AC. Secondly, the test methodology predicts an increased fatigue resistance at lower strain levels of load when the binder ages. This is in contrast to the general belief among researchers that aging is one of the primary contributors to the acceleration of pavement cracking. This study aims to evaluate fatigue resistance in a more realistic approach that is more likely to exist in AC by incorporating <b>sand</b> <b>asphalt</b> mixtures. First, the linear viscoelastic properties of binder and <b>sand</b> <b>asphalt</b> mixture samples were evaluated to obtain the material properties under the influence of aging. Later, the fatigue tests on the <b>sand</b> <b>asphalt</b> mixture were investigated to understand the influence of a thin film of binder on the fatigue resistance. It was observed that based energy dissipation criterion for the binder evaluated a reasonable estimate for fatigue damage at relatively lower temperatures, but was limited to capture the influence of aging. Moreover, it was observed that fatigue testing on a binder at an intermediate temperature of 25 °C could cause edge effects to dominate as seen in the plateau regime for the phase angle in the time sweep tests. In order to overcome the edge effects in the binder LAS tests, the <b>sand</b> <b>asphalt</b> mixture testing was used for analyzing the binder fatigue resistance. <b>Sand</b> <b>asphalt</b> mixture testing could capture the microcracking and macrocracking phases more distinctively when compared to binder testing. In the case of pressure aging vessel (PAV) aged samples, it was observed that the macrocracking phase disappeared and was replaced by sudden changes in the material properties, indicating that the PAV aged mixture was more susceptible to fatigue cracking. By using the simplified viscoelastic continuum damage approach, the fatigue resistance of the binder and <b>sand</b> <b>asphalt</b> mixture was evaluated. The <b>sand</b> <b>asphalt</b> mixture testing was better to capture the influence of aging and changes in the microstructure during fatigue in comparison to binder fatigue tests.

30|$|Lastly, {{the finite}} element {{analysis}} shows that although SAMIs are required to have low stiffness, a very low stiffness may give undesirable results. As, it was observed in this study, the <b>sand</b> <b>asphalt</b> having stiffness of 118, 209 and 635  MPa at 10, 20 and 30  °C resulted in increased strain in the overlay.|$|E
30|$|Figure  5 {{shows the}} strain {{predicted}} {{at the bottom}} of the overlay for both control specimens and those with SAMIs. The figure indicates that the strains {{at the bottom of}} the overlay are lower in the specimens with SAMIs than those without SAMIs, except the specimens with <b>sand</b> <b>asphalt</b> as SAMI, which have greater strain than the control. However, at 30  °C, the results are mixed. This is probably due to the high load magnitude and temperature. Whilst high strain concentration exists around the crack region in the models with SAMIs, the lower strains in the overlay indicate that the SAMIs are able to isolate the overlay from the strain concentration. Moreover, since greater strains were predicted in the overlay of models with <b>sand</b> <b>asphalt</b> as SAMIs, it shows that they might not be able to retard reflective cracking. The predicted strains increase with increasing temperature. This indicates that performance reduces as temperature increases.|$|E

This study deals with the development of experimental methods for measuring total suction in HMA, which can be defined as the free energy state of water in HMA mixes. The total suction is related to the ability of moisture to get into the mix under unsaturated conditions; it is also related to the ability of the mix to retain moisture. Soil suction has been studied extensively. However, suction in HMA as a porous material and its relationship to moisture damage have not been studied. The development of a procedure to measure the total suction in HMA mixes is the first objective of this research. The second objective is to relate suction measurements to physical and chemical properties of the mixtures. The objectives were achieved in two phases. In the first phase, the total suction was measured in HMA specimens with different types of aggregates (limestone and granite), and with different air void distributions and aggregate gradations. The results of this phase showed that the drying test using a 60 oC temperature-controlled room is the proper setup for measuring the total suction in HMA using thermocouple psychrometers. The characteristics of suction-moisture content curves were found {{to be related to the}} air void distribution in HMA. In the second phase, total suction was measured in <b>sand</b> <b>asphalt</b> specimens.

40|$|Background: Hippotherapy uses {{horseback riding}} {{movements}} for therapeutic purposes. In {{addition to the}} horse's movement, the choice of equipment and types of floor are also useful in the intervention. The quantification of dynamic parameters that define {{the interaction of the}} surface of contact between horse and rider provides insight into how the type of floor surface variations act upon the subject's postural control. Objective: To test whether different types of surfaces promote changes in the amplitude (ACOP) and velocity (VCOP) of the center of pressure (COP) displacement during the rider's contact with the saddle on the horse's back. Method: Twenty two healthy adult male subjects with experience in riding were evaluated. The penetration resistances of <b>asphalt,</b> <b>sand</b> and grass surfaces were measured. The COP data were collected on the three surfaces using a pressure measurement mat. Results: ACOP values were higher in sand, followed by grass and asphalt, with significant differences between <b>sand</b> and <b>asphalt</b> (anteroposterior, p= 0. 042; mediolateral, p= 0. 019). The ACOP and VCOP values were higher in the anteroposterior than in the mediolateral direction on all surfaces (ACOP, p= 0. 001; VCOP, p= 0. 006). The VCOP did not differ between the surfaces.
