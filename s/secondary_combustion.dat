40|$|Source {{apportionment}} of PM 10 and PM 2. 5 samples {{collected in}} an industrial area of the Po Valley was performed by using the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model and a semiempirical calculation of five macro-source contributions. Samples were collected during four monitoring periods, January-February 2011, June 2012, January-February 2012, May-June 2012, {{resulting in a total}} of 720 samples (360 for PM 10 and 360 for PM 2. 5). PMF variables included major elements, ions, elemental carbon and organic compounds and minor and trace elements. In order to increase the selectivity of minor and trace elements as source tracers, a chemical fractionation methodology based on the elemental solubility was employed; it was thus possible to include the extractable, the residual or both thefractions of the minor and trace elements in the database. PMF resolved six factors for PM 10 (crustal matter, marine aerosol, industry, secondary/oil <b>combustion,</b> <b>secondary</b> nitrate/biomass burning/exhaust particles, brake/tyre wear/re-suspended road dust) and seven factors for PM 2. 5 (crustal matter, marine aerosol, industry, secondary nitrate, biomass burning, other secondary components, <b>secondary</b> sulphate/oil <b>combustion).</b> Mixing properties of the lower atmosphere were monitored by using natural radioactivity. The lack in the separation of some sources was shown to be due to their co-variation during periods of high atmospheric stability in the cold months. Seasonal variations of the source contributions were evaluated and discussed. PMF results were compared with those obtained by a semiempirical calculation method in which analytical results are grouped into five macro-sources (crustal matter, marine aerosol, <b>secondary</b> inorganic compounds, <b>combustion</b> products from vehicular emissions and organics).

The long-term monitoring data of elements, ions, and black carbon showed that the major constituents of PM 2. 5 were black carbon (BC) crustal elements, nitrates, ammonium salts, and sulfates.

40|$|Residential wood burning {{contributes}} to the total atmospheric aerosol burden; however, large uncertainties remain in the magnitude and characteristics of wood burning products. Primary emissions are influenced {{by a variety of}} parameters, including appliance type, burner wood load and wood type. In addition to directly emitted particles, previous laboratory studies have shown that oxidation of gas-phase emissions produces compounds with sufficiently low volatility to readily partition to the particles, forming considerable quantities of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). However, relatively little is known about wood burning SOA, and the effects of burn parameters on SOA formation and composition are yet to be determined. There is clearly a need for further study of primary and <b>secondary</b> wood <b>combustion</b> aerosols to advance our knowledge of atmospheric aerosols and their impacts on health, air quality and climate. For the first time, smog chamber experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of wood loading on both primary and <b>secondary</b> wood <b>combustion</b> products. Products were characterized using a range of particle- and gas-phase instrumentation, including an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS). A novel approach for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) quantification from AMS data was developed and results were compared to those from GC-MS analysis of filter samples. Similar total particle mass emission factors were observed under high and average wood loadings; however, high fuel loadings were found to generate significantly higher contributions of PAHs to the total organic aerosol (OA) mass compared to average loadings. PAHs contributed 15 ± 4 % (mean ± 2 sample standard deviations) to the total OA mass in high-load experiments, compared to 4 ± 1 % in average-load experiments. With aging, total OA concentrations increased by a factor of 3 ± 1 for high load experiments compared to 1. 6 ± 0. 4 for average-load experiments. In the AMS, an increase in PAH and aromatic signature ions at lower m / z values, likely fragments from larger functionalized PAHs, was observed with aging. Filter samples also showed an increase in functionalized PAHs in the particles with aging, particularly oxidized naphthalene species. As PAHs and their oxidation products are known to have deleterious effects on health, this is a noteworthy finding to aid in the mitigation of negative wood burning impacts by improving burner operation protocols...|$|R

Even in completely plastic bodied cartridges, such as the Activ brand shotgun shells, a thin metal ring is molded into the rim to provide support for the extractor.

This is largely achieved through causing the maximum amount of material to combust, which results in a net efficiency of 60 to 70% as contrasted to less than 30% for an open fireplace.
