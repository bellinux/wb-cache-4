40|$|A multi-lateral {{horizontal}} well {{is one of}} the main well types employed in the coal bed methane (CBM) development. In a traditional CBM multi-lateral {{horizontal well}}, either a major hole or laterals will go crossing through coal beds to the largest extent, which may eventually result in bed collapse, footage failing to meet the design requirement, and the major hole unable to be monitored, re-entered and flushed. Therefore, this paper puts forward a design idea of a tree-like horizontal well composed of a major hole (for dredging passage), laterals (for controlling drainage area) and <b>sub-laterals</b> (for enhancing production). The major hole is usually drilled on the stable roof or floor of a coal bed, laterals are drilled from the major hole into coal beds, and several <b>sub-laterals</b> are drilled from laterals. The major hole, laterals and <b>sub-laterals</b> constitute a tree-like drainage and recovery system, whose major hole remains stable for a long period and can be monitored and maintained. The technique has been successfully applied in Well ZS 1 P- 5 H in the Qinshui Basin, Shanxi. The well included one major hole, 13 laterals, and 26 <b>sub-laterals,</b> with a total drilling footage of 12288  m, a total coal bed footage of 9512  m, and a total pure coal footage of 9408  m. Its major hole was fully placed in the mudstone of the coal bed roof. This well records a successful case of incident-free single well drilling with a footage of more than 10, 000  m and serves as a new well type for efficient CBM development in China...|$|R
40|$|Initial {{construction}} costs and net annual changes in operating and maintenance expenses are identified for a three-component capital renovation project {{proposed by the}} United Irrigation District to the U. S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR). The proposed project involves: installing 4. 66 miles of pipeline in the Main Canal and Lateral 7 N, installing 13. 46 miles of pipeline in several laterals and <b>sub-laterals,</b> and rehabilitating the District?s Rio Grande diversion pumping plant. Both nominal and real estimates of water and energy savings and expected economic and financial costs of those savings are identified throughout the anticipated useful lives for all three components. Sensitivity results for both the cost of saving water {{and the cost of}} saving energy are presented for several important parameters. Annual water and energy savings forthcoming from the total project are estimated, using amortization procedures, to be 1, 409 ac-ft of water per year and 4, 506, 882, 727 BTUs (1, 320, 892 kwh) of energy per year. The calculated economic and financial cost of saving water is estimated to be $ 325. 20 per ac-ft. The calculated economic and financial cost of saving energy is estimated at $ 0. 0001113 per BTU ($ 0. 380 per kwh). In addition, real (vs. nominal) values are estimated for the USBRs three principal evaluation measures specified in the U. S. Public Law 106 - 576. The aggregate initial construction cost per ac-ft of water savings measure is $ 354. 30 per ac-ft of water savings. The aggregate initial construction cost per BTU (kwh) of energy savings measure is $ 0. 0003376 per BTU ($ 1. 152 per kwh). The aggregate ratio of initial {{construction costs}} per dollar of total annual economic savings is estimated to be - 3. 442...|$|R

50|$|Interestingly enough {{there are}} at least two {{distinct}} larvae forms that reared out to ohioense. Referring to them as the light type, that meets the criteria of the historical profile created by Traver 1935, for this form in the larva state. The other is the dark type, which is only found on very dark background substraights. The principal difference in the adults is the lack of median line, and the <b>sub-lateral</b> shading on the dorsal side of all tergites. The principal difference in the larvae is the discontinuous submedial abdominal stripes in the dark type, and continuous stripes in the light type.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} seismogeological studies of active faults bordering the Upper Kerulen basin, {{one of the}} largest intermountain basins of the Khentei upland. Morphometric and trenching methods were applied to estimate the main parameters of seismogenic dislocations and associated Holocene palaeoearthquakes (540 – 2810, 3170 – 3720, and 7480 – 9220 years ago). The maximum palaeoearthquake magnitude (7. 5) characterizes the seismic capacity of the potential focal area (PFA) confined to the Kerulen fault. The new data show the need to revise the potential seismicity concepts of the southern Khentey area and to make appropriate changes in the general seismic zoning maps. The relationship between the dislocations and the modern topography features, as well as deformation of the subsurface sediments in the studied mine openings give evidence of thrusting under the <b>sub-lateral</b> to north-western subhorizontal compression.   </p...|$|E
