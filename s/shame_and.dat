5|$|Given {{the varied}} and even {{contradictory}} {{interpretations of the}} colour green, its precise meaning in the poem remains ambiguous. In English folklore and literature, green was traditionally used to symbolise nature and its associated attributes: fertility and rebirth. Stories of the medieval period also used it to allude to love and the base desires of man. Because of its connection with faeries and spirits in early English folklore, green also signified witchcraft, devilry and evil. It can also represent decay and toxicity. When combined with gold, as with the Green Knight and the girdle, green was often seen as representing youth's passing. In Celtic mythology, green was associated with misfortune and death, and therefore avoided in clothing. The green girdle, originally worn for protection, {{became a symbol of}} <b>shame</b> <b>and</b> cowardice; it is finally adopted as a symbol of honour by the knights of Camelot, signifying a transformation from good to evil and back again; this displays both the spoiling and regenerative connotations of the colour green.|$|E
5|$|Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladova, {{variously}} called Sonya and Sonechka, is {{the daughter}} of a drunkard named Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, whom Raskolnikov meets in a tavern {{at the beginning of the}} novel. She is often characterized as self-sacrificial, shy, and even innocent despite the fact that she is compelled into prostitution to help her family. She also, as Raskolnikov discerns, shares the same feelings of <b>shame</b> <b>and</b> alienation as he does and becomes the first person to whom Raskolnikov confesses his crime, and she supports him even though she was friends with one of the victims (Lizaveta). Throughout the novel, Sonya is an important source of moral strength and rehabilitation for Raskolnikov, and in some interpretations, even considered a Christ-like figure. She is forced to prostitute herself to provide for her family, leading some critics to make comparisons with Mary Magdalene.|$|E
5|$|Some ignorant clerics reject {{calculations}} {{of this kind}} (for <b>shame!)</b> <b>and</b> {{do not wish to}} keep their phylacteries, that is, they do not preserve the order, which they have received in the bosom of mother church, nor do they persist in the holy teaching of meditation. They should consider carefully the way of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and they should spit out their doctrine like filth. A cleric ought to be the keeper of his own soul, just as a noble man subjects a young foal to the yoke, so he ought to subject his own soul to service, by filling the alabaster box with precious oil, that is, he ought to be inwardly subjected daily, by obeying the divine laws and admonitions of the Redeemer.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} basic psychological needs satisfaction (i. e., {{the need for}} autonomy, competence, and relatedness) as a mediator between adult attachment (i. e., anxiety and avoidance) and distress (i. e., <b>shame,</b> depression, <b>and</b> loneliness). A total of 299 undergraduates from a Midwestern university participated. Results from structural equation modeling analysis indicated that basic psychological needs satisfaction partially mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety <b>and</b> <b>shame,</b> depression, <b>and</b> loneliness and fully mediated the relationship between attachment avoidance <b>and</b> <b>shame,</b> depression, <b>and</b> loneliness. Bootstrap methods {{were used to assess}} the magnitude of these indirect effects. Attachment anxiety and avoidance explained 35 % of the variance in basic psychological needs satisfaction, and attachment anxiety and basic psychological needs satisfaction explained 51 %, 72 %, and 74 % of the variance in <b>shame,</b> depression, <b>and</b> loneliness, respectively...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} of shaming penalties. It establishes {{that there may be}} an inverse relation between the rate of <b>shaming</b> penalties <b>and</b> their deterrent effects - the more people are shamed the less deterring shaming penalties become. This conclusion is based on a search model in which the costs of searching for law-abiding partners increase with the rate of <b>shaming,</b> <b>and</b> may lead to lower expected sanction for offenders. The inverse relation between the rate of <b>shaming</b> penalties <b>and</b> their effectiveness is later used to show that increasing the probability of detection, increasing the magnitude of shaming penalties or reducing the number of wrongful acquittals does not necessarily increase the deterrent effects of <b>shaming</b> penalties (<b>and</b> may, in fact, decrease these effects). ...|$|R

5|$|The {{painting}} {{passed from}} Haro into {{the collection of}} his daughter Catalina de Haro y Guzmán, the eighth Marchioness of Carpio, and her husband, Francisco Álvarez de Toledo, the tenth Duke of Alba. In 1802, Charles IV of Spain ordered the family to sell the painting (with other works) to Manuel de Godoy, his favourite and chief minister. He hung it alongside two masterpieces by Francisco Goya {{that he may have}} commissioned himself, The Nude Maja and The Clothed Maja. These bear obvious compositional similarities with Velázquez's Venus, although unlike Velázquez, Goya clearly painted his nude in a calculated attempt to provoke <b>shame</b> <b>and</b> disgust in the relatively unenlightened climate of 18th-century Spain.|$|E

By throwing out his furniture and keepsakes, Carl manages to lighten the house enough to follow. Russell is captured by Muntz, but Carl manages to board the dirigible, tether the house, and free Russell and Kevin. Dug inadvertently saddles Alpha with his cone of <b>shame</b> <b>and</b> becomes the dogs' new leader. Muntz pursues them around the airship, trapping Dug, Kevin and Russell inside Carl's house. Carl lures Kevin back onto the airship, with Dug and Russell clinging to her back. Muntz leaps after them, but snags his foot on some balloon lines and falls to his death. The house then descends out of sight through the clouds.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the war, one pressing problem was the very high number of unwanted pregnancies of rape victims. Estimates of the number of pregnancies resulting in births range from 25,000 to the Bangladeshi government's figure of 70,000, while one publication by the Centre for Reproductive Law and Policy gave a total of 250,000. A government-mandated victim relief programme was set up with the support of the World Health Organization and International Planned Parenthood Federation, among whose goals it was to organise abortion facilities to help rape victims terminate unwanted pregnancies. A doctor at a rehabilitation centre in Dhaka reported 170,000 abortions of pregnancies caused by the rapes, and the births of 30,000 war babies during the first three months of 1972. Dr. Geoffrey Davis, an Australian doctor and abortion specialist who worked for the programme, estimated that there had been about 5,000 cases of self-induced abortions. He also said that during his work he heard of numerous infanticides and suicides by victims. His estimate of the total number of rape victims was 400,000, twice as high as the official estimate of 200,000 cited by the Bangladeshi government. Most of the victims also contracted sexual infections. Many suffered from feelings of intense <b>shame</b> <b>and</b> humiliation, and a number were ostracised by their families and communities or committed suicide.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{individual differences}} in shame responding in early childhood and predictive relations with shame proneness in middle childhood. Child shame responding, parental <b>shaming,</b> <b>and</b> child temperamental inhibition were assessed at Time 1 (n = 225, aged 3 – 4 years), shame responding was reassessed at Time 2 (n = 199, aged 5 – 7 years), <b>and</b> <b>shame</b> proneness was assessed at Time 3 (n = 162, aged 7 – 9 years). Shame responding was assessed from emotionexpressive reactions to failure, parental <b>shaming</b> from self-reports <b>and</b> spouse reports, temperamental inhibition from mother and father ratings, <b>and</b> <b>shame</b> proneness from hypothetical scenarios. Girls showed more shame than boys by school age. Increased shame responding between preschool age and school age was predicted, for girls, from lower inhibition or higher mother <b>shaming</b> <b>and,</b> for boys, from higher mother shaming if boys were highly inhibited. Shame responding at preschool age predicted higher or lower shame proneness in middle childhood conditional on gender and parenting...|$|R

While sharing of emotional events involves self-disclosure, feelings of <b>shame</b> <b>and</b> guilt are associated with concealment of the self.|$|E
