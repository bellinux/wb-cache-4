5000|$|Bed-material load is {{composed}} of larger grains {{than any of the}} other loads. The rate in which grains travel is dependent on the transporting capacity of the flow. Particles move by rolling, sliding, or saltation (bouncing or jumping of grains) at velocities less than that of the <b>surrounding</b> <b>flow.</b> Rolling is the primary mode of transport in gravel-bed streams, while saltation in which grains hop over the bed in a series of low trajectories is largely restricted to sands and small gravels. Various equations are used to estimate the rate at which sediments are transported through the fluvial system. Bed-material discharge equations generally are applicable only within the range of flow conditions and sediment sizes for which the equations were derived.

50|$|In late transition, T-S {{oscillations}} become amplified focally (Schubauer and Skramstad 1943), creating {{spots of}} high amplitude SH BL transverse sound waves. This creates vigorous transverse molecular oscillation as waves of coherent sound energy pass perpendicularly through-longitudinally flowing BL laminae, potentially freezing laminar slip (laminar interlocking). Abruptly, friction transfers to the highly resistant boundary (G Hamilton 1980 and 2015) as laminar-interlocked chunks are ripped out of long-crested T-S waves and tumble head-over-heels along the boundary (Hamilton 2015) as turbulent spots (Schubauer and Skramstad 1943), {{which are also}} known as “flashes of turbulence” in cylinders (Reynolds 1867). With further increase in flow rate, full-blown high-resistance turbulent flow erupts. with many turbulent spots and generalized laminar interlocking (G Hamilton 1980 and 2015). A linear transverse boundary impediment apparently forces turbulent spots to re-align into the SH long-crested waves from which they were ripped, with the <b>surrounding</b> <b>flow</b> retaining its disturbed (turbulent) surface wave pattern (Hamilton 2015: pp. 12-13).|$|E

50|$|Hydroxyl tagging {{velocimetry}} (HTV) is a velocimetry {{method used}} in humid air flows. Themethod {{is often used}} in high-speed combusting flows because the high velocity and temperatureaccentuate its advantages over similar methods. HTV uses a laser (often an argon-fluorideexcimer laser operating at ~193 nm) to dissociate {{the water in the}} flow into H + OH. Before entering the flow optics areused to create a grid of laser beams. The water in the flow is dissociated only where beams ofsufficient energy pass through the flow, thus creating a grid in the flow where theconcentrations of hydroxyl (OH) are higher than in the <b>surrounding</b> <b>flow.</b> Another laser beam (at either ~248 nm or ~308 nm) inthe form of a sheet is also passed through the flow in the same plane as the grid. This laserbeam is tuned to a wavelength that causes the hydroxyl molecules to fluoresce in the UV spectrum. The fluorescence is then captured by a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Usingelectronic timing methods the picture of the grid can be captured at nearly the same instantthat the grid is created.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} between thin structures and incompressible Newtonian fluids is ubiquitous both {{in nature and}} in industrial applications. In this paper we present an isogeometric formulation of such problems which exploits a boundary integral formulation of Stokes equations to model the <b>surrounding</b> <b>flow,</b> and a non linear Kirchhoff-Love shell theory to model the elastic behaviour of the structure. We propose three different coupling strategies: a monolithic, fully implicit coupling, a staggered, elasticity driven coupling, and a novel semi-implicit coupling, where {{the effect of the}} <b>surrounding</b> <b>flow</b> is incorporated in the non-linear terms of the solid solver through its damping characteristics. The novel semi-implicit approach is then used to demonstrate the power and robustness of our method, which fits ideally in the isogeometric paradigm, by exploiting only the boundary representation (B-Rep) of the thin structure middle surface.
