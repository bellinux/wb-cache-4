2500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s Francis Welham and Arthur Levell {{conceived}} a new single spar duralumin wing structure that promised weight savings without loss of strength. It {{was quite different}} from the already established Monospar design. [...] The wing was built around a cross braced, girder-like box, with the front and rear members attached to it with cantilever ribs. [...] With financial support from S.W. Cole of EKCO radio, they set up a company known by their initials as CLW Aviation, based at Gravesend, Kent and built a wing for testing. [...] This performed to the calculations even under destructive testing, and the company decided to produce a <b>small</b> <b>aeroplane</b> using it. The CLW Curlew was intended both as a demonstrator and as a trainer for those pilots going on to modern, fast monoplanes. It was also seen as a contender in the open two-seater market, particularly for the richer buyer after a machine with [...] "snappier" [...] performance. [...] It made its first flight on 3 September 1936 at Gravesend, flown by the ex-Beardmore pilot A.N. Kingwill.|$|E

50|$|The airport handles {{an average}} {{of more than two}} million {{passengers}} a year, and millions of pounds of cargo. The airport's main runway can handle airliners as large as the Boeing 747, although most passengers arrive on <b>smaller</b> <b>aeroplanes,</b> such as ATR-42s, Boeing 737s and Boeing 757s. Boeing 747 activity at this airport is almost exclusively limited to cargo flights.|$|R
50|$|It must be remembered, however {{that what}} was called an aerodrome in those days would by no means meet {{requirements}} for {{even some of the}} <b>small</b> <b>aeroplanes</b> of' modern times. In the early days it was considered necessary to construct several runways oriented in varying directions to avoid cross wind landings and take-offs, as the older type of tail wheel aircraft was more prone to swing than the modern nose wheel types.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s, Cedric became an equally avid fan of flying <b>small</b> <b>aeroplanes.</b> In his 1933 book, Amateur Pilot, {{he wrote a}} sort of guide to flying planes in an era where one needs {{nothing more than a}} plane and an empty field, to take a flight around the country. Cedric {{provided}} many interesting anecdotes regarding his experiences in aviation, as well as providing an interesting glance into this unregulated era for amateur pilots.|$|R

50|$|On {{the advice}} of the Soviets, ZIPRA built up its {{conventional}} forces, and motorised with Soviet armoured vehicles and a number of <b>small</b> <b>aeroplanes,</b> in Zambia. ZIPRA's (i.e. ZAPU's) intention was to allow ZANLA to bring the Rhodesian forces to the point of defeat, and then to take the victory from the much lighter forces of ZANLA and the essentially defeated Rhodesians. ZIPRA kept a light presence within Rhodesia, reconnoitring, keeping contact with the peasants and sometimes skirmishing with ZANLA.|$|R

5000|$|In August 1938 Barnwell {{had been}} killed flying a <b>small</b> <b>aeroplane</b> of his own design. Leslie Frise took over the Chief Designer role, with Russell {{becoming}} deputy. They were immediately put {{to work on a}} variety of development of the Blenheim, including the Type 152 Beaufort and Type 156 Beaufighter. More than 5,500 Beaufighter's were built before the war ended.

He then claimed that the object had moved directly in front of his plane; the airport personnel then heard a metallic [...] "scraping" [...] sound, followed by silence. Valentich and his plane subsequently vanished and neither Valentich nor his plane were ever seen again.|$|E
5000|$|In 1948 George Fontenis {{teamed up}} {{with a group of}} exiled CNT and FAI militants to attempt the {{assassination}} of General Franco.

Fontenis provided his name and nationality for the purchase of a <b>small</b> <b>aeroplane,</b> intended to be used to bomb a pleasure boat occupied by the [...] "Causillo" [...] in San Sebastián Bay. The attempt failed. In February 1951 Fontenis was briefly arrested in connection with the affair, but soon released because alleged (but fictitious) links to the plotters could not be demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|In the Spanish Civil War, the Luftwaffe in the Condor Legion {{tried out}} air {{fighting}} tactics {{and their new}} aeroplanes. Wolfram von Richthofen become an exponent of air power providing ground support to other services. The difficulty of accurately hitting targets prompted Ernst Udet to require that all new bombers had to be dive bombers, {{and led to the}} development of the Knickebein system for night time navigation. Priority was given to producing large numbers of <b>smaller</b> <b>aeroplanes,</b> and plans for a long range four engined strategic bomber were delayed.|$|R

50|$|During this war, {{the system}} of {{government}} changed: Governor Eske Brun ruled the island under a law of 1925 that allowed governors to take control under extreme circumstances; Governor Aksel Svane {{was transferred to the}} United States to lead the commission to supply Greenland. The Danish Sirius Patrol guarded the northeastern shores of Greenland in 1942 using dogsleds. They detected several German weather stations and alerted American troops, who destroyed the facilities. After the collapse of the Third Reich, Albert Speer briefly considered escaping in a <b>small</b> <b>aeroplane</b> to hide out in Greenland, but changed his mind and decided to surrender to the United States Armed Forces.|$|E

50|$|Dick enjoyed {{going back}} to his family home on {{holidays}}. On one of these holidays he caught the eye disease trachoma, which affected his vision and caused problems for him in later life. On these holidays he did his fair share of hunting and fishing. He saw his first <b>small</b> <b>aeroplane</b> - of the Flying Doctor service - while living at the mission school. He left school at about 13 {{years of age and}} continued his education with the tribal elders, learning Lardil laws and the ways of hunting. He learnt when to feast and when to dance. He did not undergo ceremonial initiation - normally undertaken around this age - because the missionaries had asked the elders to stop the ceremonies. Dick spoke Lardil language but not Damin language, as he is not initiated.|$|E
50|$|During World War I and {{for some}} time after, the only {{successful}} transportable hangar design was the Bessonneau hangar. This could be very quickly erected and secured to provide adequate shelter for a few <b>small</b> <b>aeroplanes.</b> But with post-war increases in the number and size of aeroplanes, the need for larger transportable accommodation soon became apparent. The Air Ministry therefore issued a specification in 1936 covering the dimensions and requirements for a light transportable shed for use in war. It had to be end-opening with doors at both ends, be capable of mass production and have interchangeable parts to permit rapid erection and dismantling with minimal permanent foundations. This specification was submitted to various designers and eventually two different designs were presented - the Bellman and the Callender Hangar.|$|R
5000|$|The Tilbury Flash is a single-seat American racing {{monoplane}} {{designed and}} built in the 1930s by Owen Tilbury and Cecil Fundy. The aircraft was built in 1932 and was entered in the US National Air Races. At Cleveland, {{at the time it}} was described as probably the <b>smallest</b> racing <b>aeroplane</b> in the world.|$|R
2500|$|One of the {{significant}} innovations of the Akron-class was the presence within the airship's hull of a hangar capable of accommodating up to five <b>small</b> <b>aeroplanes,</b> with a [...] "trapeze" [...] apparatus used for launching and recovering them; the aircraft were fitted with a [...] "skyhook" [...] apparatus that {{hooked up to a}} horizontal spar – for launch, the aircraft were hooked on within the hangar and lowered into the airstream, where the hook would be disconnected and the aircraft released, with the process working in reverse for recovery. In order that the ship had a stable equilibrium, rather than having the aircraft aboard on its departure, normal practice would have it setting off, before rendezvousing with the air group while airborne, and bringing them aboard using the trapeze. The Akron-class also employed a [...] "spy basket", a small aerodynamic gondola suspended from the ship by a line, which allowed observation of any enemy formation while the ship remained hidden within cloud cover.|$|R
