5000|$|Reid {{was known}} for {{innovative}} and fashionable swimsuit designs and production. She was the first swimsuit designer to use inner brassieres, tummy-tuck panels, stay-down legs, elastic banding, brief skirts, and foundation garments in swimwear. She {{was also the first}} designer to introduce dress sizes in swimwear, designing swimwear for multiple <b>sizes</b> and <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>bodies,</b> rather than just producing one standard size. Reid filed for a U.S. Patent in 1950 for a one-piece bathing suit using elastic fabric and that lacked buttons. Her company patented a machine for a fagotting stitch that became a hallmark of her designs. She had several other patents for swimsuits and accessories.|$|R

Human <b>body</b> <b>type</b> classifications are also very crucial issue for garment manufacturing. Data mining has been widely used in many fields. But, there is lack of {{research in the area of}} establishing of garment-sizing systems for business logistics. This research aims to establish <b>sizing</b> systems <b>of</b> <b>body</b> <b>types</b> from the anthropometric data of females by using a fuzzy clustering-based data mining approach. Certain advantages may be observed when the sizing systems are established, using fuzzy clustering-based data mining procedure. <b>Body</b> <b>types</b> could be accurately classified for garment production according the newly the sizing systems. This approach is found to be effective in processing the anthropometric data, and obtaining regular rules for the development <b>of</b> <b>sizing</b> systems. The results of this study can provide an effective procedure of identifying the clusters <b>of</b> human <b>body</b> <b>type</b> to establish the sizing systems for integrating logistics operations internally with different functions inside the organization and also externally with business partners...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{presents}} algorithms for {{constraint set}} satisfiability and simplification that use a termination criterion {{which is based}} on a measure <b>of</b> the <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>types</b> in type constraints. The sequence of constraints that unify with a constraint axiom in recursive calls of the function that checks satisfiability or simplification <b>of</b> a <b>type</b> constraint is such that either the <b>sizes</b> <b>of</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> each constraint in this sequence is decreasing or there exists at least one type parameter position with decreasing size.|$|R

But the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>type</b> information remains a concern for certifying compilers in practice. This paper demonstrates type representation techniques in a large-scale compiler that achieves both concise type information and efficient type checking. In our 200, 000 -line certifying compiler, the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>type</b> information is about 36 % <b>of</b> the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> pure code and data for our benchmarks, the best result to the best of our knowledge.
