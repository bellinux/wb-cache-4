In 1986 the HBS bible collection was permanently deposited in the Russell Library ([URL]) at Maynooth University ([URL]) and St Patrick’s College, Maynooth ([URL] A series of <b>sheaf</b> <b>catalogues</b> accompanied the collection, providing important details relating to provenance and imprints. Items in the collection have retained their original shelf-marks and are identifiable by the prefix ‘HBS’. Highlights of the collection include copies of the first published edition of the Greek New Testament, the King James Bible and the earliest edition of the Old Testament in Irish. 1 A decision was made in late 2016 to catalogue material in the HBS collection retrospectively, {{as part of the}} Russell Library Cataloguing Project...|$|R

CIPACs are online library catalogues based on databases of digitised catalogue cards with more or less sophisticated mechanisms for browsing or searching. Solutions of this kind have been implemented by a number of libraries in various countries since the mid- 1990 s, mainly as inexpensive alternatives to full retrospective conversion of their old Background Since the introduction of automated library systems and of online public access catalogues in particular, one of the greatest challenges for library managers has been the transfer of older records into the OPACs. Some libraries have already achieved this goal, but many others are still far away from closing their old card, <b>sheaf</b> or book <b>catalogues.</b> Recataloguing is expensive and, therefore, normally not feasible on a large scale (Dugall 2001). However, the conversion of existing records into machine-readable records (retroconversion) is not cheap either. Studies of large conversion projects have shown that the average cost per record is between 2. 42 and 4. 23 Euros (Beyersdorff 1993; Bryant 1997; Leeves, Butler & Mealia 1999), which means that for larger projects or national programmes enormous sums of money are required. The digitisation (scanning) of catalogue cards has become common practice in retroconversion – not only as a prerequisite for approaches that involve optical character recognition (OCR), but als...|$|R
