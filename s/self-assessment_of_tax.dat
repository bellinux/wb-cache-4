40|$|This study aims (i) to {{ascertain}} the demand for tax education among Malaysian undergraduates from non-accounting disciplines; (ii) to examine the level <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> knowledge among non-accounting undergraduates; (iii) to identify the instructional methods to be used; and (iv) to determine the relevant tax topics to be covered in tax course for the non-accounting curriculum. A questionnaire was given to undergraduates from non-accounting disciplines in three public universities in Malaysia from the month of February to April 2011. Out of the 1, 575 questionnaires distributed, 995 usable responses were received and analyzed. This survey found (i) {{majority of the respondents}} were in favor <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> education being introduced into non-accounting curriculum as an elective paper; (ii) about 44. 9 % had little tax knowledge; (iii) the most preferred methods of teaching taxation are case studies and face-to-face classroom learning; and (iv) the topics that the respondents would like to learn the most are personal taxation, tax planning for individual and basic concepts of taxation. The findings provided important insight in order to reform the current education policy, to introduce tax education formally in non-accounting curriculum, as tax education is the pillar that builds a tax literate society. This study could be seen as the first large-scale study conducted after the implementation <b>of</b> <b>self-assessment</b> <b>tax</b> system in Malaysia.

40|$|Accurate <b>self-assessment</b> <b>of</b> {{skill is}} {{important}} because it creates an appropriate level of confidence and hence behaviour. Inaccurate <b>self-assessment</b> <b>of</b> driving ability has been linked to reckless driving and accidents. Inaccurate <b>self-assessment</b> <b>of</b> driving skills may be a contributing factor to the over-representation of young male drivers in accident statistics. Most previous research on <b>self-assessment</b> <b>of</b> driving skills did not compare self-reported skills to objectively measured driving skills, so the aims of this study were: (1) to test the accuracy of young male drivers’ <b>self-assessments</b> <b>of</b> specific driving skills by comparing them with performance in a driving simulator; (2) to test whether self-assessment accuracy varied with driving skill, driving experience and sensation-seeking propensity. We found that young male drivers’ self-assessments were inconsistent with their driving performance, and that this inconsistency varied with driving skill, driving experience and sensation-seeking propensity. Groups with particularly inaccurate self-assessments are at high risk, because of their relative lack of skill, high mileage and sensation-seeking propensity. <b>Self-assessments</b> <b>of</b> hazard prediction and detection skills were particularly inaccurate. Understanding <b>self-assessments</b> <b>of</b> driving skill is crucial, but further studies are needed to allow preventive policies and interventions to take factors affecting self-assessments into account...|$|R

This study evaluated the efficacy <b>of</b> <b>self-assessment</b> practice as a possible innovative method towards achieving high coverage and excellent quality of larviciding operation in Iran. Methods The research {{was conducted on the}} randomly selected rural health centre of Kanmbel Soliman with 10 staff and 30 villages, in three main steps: (i) assessment of effectiveness of larviciding operations in the study areas before intervention through external assessment by a research team; (ii) <b>self-assessment</b> <b>of</b> larviciding operations (intervention) by staff every quarter for three rounds; and, (iii) determining the effectiveness <b>of</b> applying <b>self-assessment</b> <b>of</b> larviciding operations in the study areas. Two toolkits were used for self-assessment and external evaluation. The impact <b>of</b> <b>self-assessment</b> <b>of</b> larviciding operations was measured by two indicators: percentage of missed breeding habitats and cleaned breeding habitats among randomly selected breeding sites. Moreover, the correlation coefficients were measured between self-assessment measures and scores from external evaluation. The correlation coefficient and Mann Whitney test were used to analyse data. Results Following the utilization <b>of</b> <b>self-assessment,</b> the percentage <b>of</b> missed breeding habitats decreased significantly from 14. 23 % to 1. 91 % (P Before intervention, the results <b>of</b> <b>self-assessment</b> practice were compatible with external evaluation in 76. 3 % of 139 reviewed reports <b>of</b> <b>self-assessment.</b> After intervention, the findings <b>of</b> <b>self-assessment</b> and external evaluation were similar {{in the vast majority of}} reviewed reports (95 %). Conclusion The self-assessment tool seems to be valid and reliable in improving effectiveness of larviciding operations. Furthermore, the result <b>of</b> <b>self-assessment</b> is more compatible with external evaluation results if it would be applied frequently. Therefore, it can be used as an alternative assessment technique in the evaluation of larviciding operations in addition to traditional assessment methods. </p...|$|R
