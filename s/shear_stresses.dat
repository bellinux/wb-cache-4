We sought to determine the importance of <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> in maintaining normal dilation and normal levels of ecNOS in rat soleus feed arteries (SFA).

We compared the effects of reversing <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> (time-average: 1 dyn/cm 2, maximum: + 11 dyn/cm 2, minimum: − 11 dyn/cm 2, 1 Hz), arterial steady <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> (15 dyn/cm 2), and low steady <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> (1 dyn/cm 2) on gene expression, cell proliferation, and monocyte adhesiveness. Microarray analysis revealed that most differentially expressed genes were similarly regulated by all three <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> regimens compared with static culture. Comparisons of the three <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> regimens to each other identified 138 genes regulated by low average <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> and 22 genes regulated by fluid reversal.

We examined the initial response of freshly isolated human leukocytes to fluid <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> under high magnification. Adherent leukocytes exhibit a rapid biomechanical response to physiological levels of fluid <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> After passive displacement {{in the direction of}} a constant fluid <b>shear</b> <b>stress,</b> adherent leukocytes actively recoil back in the opposite direction of the fluid flow. Recoil is observed within seconds of the applied fluid <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> Simultaneously, fluid <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> induces a stiffening of the cell. The immediate cell displacement in response to a step increase in fluid <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> is greatly attenuated in subsequent steps compared to the initial fluid <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> step. Recoil is not mediated by actin polymerization-dependent mechanisms, as cytochalasin D had no effect on this early response. However, stiffening was determined in part by an intact actin cytoskeleton. Inhibiting myosin force generation with ML- 7 abolished the recoil and stiffening responses, implicating force generation by myosin as an important contributor to the early leukocyte response to fluid <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> This initial <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> response may be particularly important in facilitating leukocyte attachment under sustained fluid <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> by the flowing blood in the microcirculation...|$|R

The effects of orbital and laminar <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> on EC morphology, proliferation, and apoptosis were compared. MethodsECs {{were exposed to}} orbital <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> with an orbital shaker (210 rpm) or laminar <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> (14 dyne/cm 2) with a parallel plate. <b>Shear</b> <b>stress</b> in the orbital shaker was measured with optical velocimetry. Cell proliferation was assessed with direct counting and proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining; apoptosis was assessed with transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling staining. Cell surface E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule expression were assessed with fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Akt phosphorylation was assessed with Western blotting. ResultsOrbital <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> increased EC proliferation by 29 % and 3 [H]thymidine incorporation two-fold compared to 16 % and 38 % decreases, respectively, in ECs treated with laminar <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> (P <. 0001 and P =. 03, analysis of variance). Cells in {{the periphery of the}} culture well aligned to the direction of <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> similar to the shape change seen with laminar <b>shear</b> <b>stress,</b> whereas ECs {{in the center of the}} well appeared unaligned similar to ECs not exposed to <b>shear</b> <b>stress.</b> <b>Shear</b> <b>stress</b> at the bottom surface of the culture well was reduced in the center of the well (5 dyne/cm 2) compared to the periphery (11 dyne/cm 2); the Reynolds’ number was 2066. ECs were seeded differentially in the center and periphery of the wells. ECs in the center of the well had increased proliferation, increased apoptosis, reduced Akt phosphorylation, increased intercelluar adhesion molecule expression, and reduced E-selectin down-regulation, compared with ECs in the periphery of the well. ConclusionAlthough the orbital shaker does not apply uniform <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> throughout the culture well, arterial magnitudes of <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> are present in the periphery of the well. ECs cultured in the center of the well exposed to low magnitudes of orbital <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> might be a model of the “activated” EC phenotype.

40|$|<b>Shear</b> <b>stress</b> of {{the blood}} at the vessel wall plays an {{important}} role in many processes in the cardiovascular system primarily focused on the regulation of vessel lumen and wall dimensions. There is ample evidence that atherosclerotic plaques are generated at low <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> regions in the cardiovascular system, while high <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> regions are protected. In the course of plaque progression, advanced plaques start to encroach into the lumen, and thereby start to experience high <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> at the endothelium. Until now the consequences of high <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> working at the endothelium of an advanced plaque are unknown. As high <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> influences tissue regression, we hypothesised that high <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> can destabilise the plaque by cap weakening leading to ulceration. We investigated this hypothesis in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset of a 67 -year-old woman with a plaque in the carotid artery at baseline and an ulcer at ten-month follow-up. The lumen, plaque components (lipid/necrotic core, intraplaque haemorrhage) and ulcer were reconstructed three dimensionally and the geometry at baseline was used for <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> calculation using computational fluid dynamics. Correlation of the change in plaque composition with the <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> at baseline showed that the ulcer was generated exclusively at the high <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> location. In this serial MRI study we found plaque ulceration at the high <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> location of a protruding plaque in the carotid artery.

25|$|Interactions {{with the}} mantle {{discontinuities}} {{play a significant}} role in slab rollback. Stagnation at the 660-km discontinuity causes retrograde slab motion due to the suction forces acting at the surface. Slab rollback induces mantle return flow, which causes extension from the <b>shear</b> <b>stresses</b> at the base of the overriding plate. As slab rollback velocities increase, circular mantle flow velocities also increase, accelerating extension rates. Extension rates are altered when the slab interacts with the discontinuities within the mantle at 410km and 660km depth. Slabs can either penetrate directly into the lower mantle, or can be retarded due to the phase transition at 660km depth creating a difference in buoyancy. An increase in retrograde trench migration (slab rollback) (2–4cm/yr) is a result of flattened slabs at the 660-km discontinuity where the slab does not penetrate into the lower mantle. This is the case for the Japan, Java and Izu-Bonin trenches. These flattened slabs are only temporarily arrested in the transition zone. The subsequent displacement into the lower mantle is caused by slab pull forces, or the destabilization of the slab from warming and broadening due to thermal diffusion. Slabs that penetrate directly into the lower mantle result in slower slab rollback rates (~1–3cm/yr) such as the Mariana arc, Tonga arcs.|$|E

25|$|Friction {{extrusion}} {{was invented}} at The Welding Institute in the UK and patented in 1991. It was originally intended {{primarily as a}} method for production of homogenous microstructures and particle distributions in metal matrix composite materials. Friction extrusion differs from conventional extrusion in that the charge (billet or other precursor) rotates relative to the extrusion die. An extrusion force is applied so as to push the charge against the die. In practice either the die or the charge may rotate {{or they may be}} counter-rotating. The relative rotary motion between the charge and the die has several significant effects on the process. First, the relative motion in the plane of rotation leads to large <b>shear</b> <b>stresses,</b> hence, plastic deformation in the layer of charge in contact with and near the die. This plastic deformation is dissipated by recovery and recrystallization processes leading to substantial heating of the deforming charge. Because of the deformation heating, friction extrusion does not generally require preheating of the charge by auxiliary means potentially resulting in a more energy efficient process. Second, the substantial level of plastic deformation in the region of relative rotary motion can promote solid state welding of powders or other finely divided precursors, such as flakes and chips, effectively consolidating the charge (friction consolidation) prior to extrusion.|$|E

30|$|Alterations in wall <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> {{have been}} implicated in the focal {{distribution}} of coronary artery disease (Dhawan et al. 2010). Atherosclerotic plaques predominantly form in regions of low <b>shear</b> <b>stress,</b> whereas regions of physiological moderate <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> are generally protected in the early stage of atherosclerosis (Wentzel et al. 2012). On the other hand, advanced plaques that start to project into the lumen experience high <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> at their most stenotic regions, which promotes plaque destabilization (Fukumoto et al. 2008). The vascular response to the altered <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> is also a determinant of plaque stability and the progression of atherosclerosis (Koskinas et al. 2010). Expanded arterial remodeling occurs in exposed lesions with high <b>shear</b> <b>stress,</b> leading to physiological and adaptive arterial enlargement to preserve the lumen and, subsequently, to restore <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> to a more physiological level (Dhawan et al. 2010). In the current study, we focused the vascular maladaptive response to increased <b>shear</b> <b>stress</b> as a coronary risk marker because the dysfunctional response finely corresponded {{to the presence of}} IHD.
