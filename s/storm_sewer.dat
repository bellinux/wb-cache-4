25|$|Modesto has a {{semi-arid}} climate (BSk in the Koeppen climate classification) It has mild winters {{with moderate}} rainfall and long, hot, dry summers. Average January temperatures range from 56°F (13°C) {{in the day}} to 40°F (4°C) at night. Most of the rainfall occurs during the winter and the annual total is 13.2inches (335mm). The city does not have a full <b>storm</b> <b>sewer</b> system, many streets flood during winter rain storms.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} off the California coast {{was most}} probably {{caused by an}} aquarium owner improperly dumping the contents, allowing C. taxifolia to flow through a <b>storm</b> <b>sewer</b> into the lagoon where the invasion was discovered. California has since passed a law forbidding the possession, sale or transport of Caulerpa taxifolia within the state. There is also a federal law under the Noxious Weed Act forbidding interstate sale and transport of the aquarium strain Caulerpa.|$|E

25|$|Typically, elaborate, {{capital-intensive}} <b>storm</b> <b>sewer</b> {{networks are}} engineered {{to deal with}} stormwater. In some cities, such as the Victorian era London sewers or much of the old City of Toronto, the storm water system is combined with the sanitary sewer system. In the event of heavy precipitation, the load on the sewage treatment plant {{at the end of}} the pipe becomes too great to handle and raw sewage is dumped into holding tanks, and sometimes into surface water.|$|E
25|$|Point {{source water}} {{pollution}} refers to contaminants that enter a waterway from a single, identifiable source, {{such as a}} pipe or ditch. Examples of sources in this category include discharges from a sewage treatment plant, a factory, or a city storm drain. The U.S. Clean Water Act (CWA) defines point source for regulatory enforcement purposes. The CWA definition of point source was amended in 1987 to include municipal <b>storm</b> <b>sewer</b> systems, as well as industrial storm water, such as from construction sites.|$|E
25|$|Although St. Louis {{separated}} from St. Louis County in 1876, some mechanisms {{have been put}} in place for joint funding management and funding of regional assets. The St. Louis Zoo-Museum district collects property taxes from residents of both St. Louis City and County and the funds are used to support cultural institutions including the St. Louis Zoo, St. Louis Art Museum and the Missouri Botanical Gardens. Similarly, the Metropolitan Sewer District provides sanitary and <b>storm</b> <b>sewer</b> service to the city and much of St. Louis County. The Bi-State Development Agency (now known as Metro) runs the region's MetroLink light rail system and bus system.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 2017, the city's Department of Environmental Protection {{started to}} build several miles of {{high-level}} <b>storm</b> <b>sewers</b> to prevent stormwater from flooding the city's sewage system. The new <b>storm</b> <b>sewers</b> will carry stormwater collected {{in new and}} existing catchment areas, preventing it from entering the sewage system. The first phase is planned for completion by 2018, with a second phase proceeding from 2018-2020.|$|R

25|$|Impervious {{surfaces}} (roads, {{parking lots}} and sidewalks) are constructed during land development. During rain storms and other precipitation events, these surfaces (built from materials such as asphalt and concrete), along with rooftops, carry polluted stormwater to storm drains, instead of allowing the water to percolate through soil. This causes lowering of the water table (because groundwater recharge is lessened) and flooding since {{the amount of water}} that remains on the surface is greater. Most municipal <b>storm</b> <b>sewer</b> systems discharge stormwater, untreated, to streams, rivers and bays. This excess water can also make its way into people's properties through basement backups and seepage through building wall and floors.|$|E
25|$|David Kazdin {{had allowed}} Kimes {{to use his}} name on the deed of a home in Las Vegas that was {{actually}} occupied by Kenneth Sr. and Sante Kimes in the 1970s. Several years later, Sante Kimes convinced a notary to forge Kazdin's signature on an application for a loan of $280,000, with the house as collateral. When Kazdin discovered the forgery and threatened to expose Kimes she ordered him killed. Kenneth Jr. murdered Kazdin by shooting him {{in the back of the}} head. According to another accomplice's later testimony, all three participated in disposing of the evidence. Kazdin's body was found in a dumpster near Los Angeles airport in March 1998. The murder weapon was never recovered, having been disassembled and dropped into a <b>storm</b> <b>sewer.</b>|$|E
25|$|According {{to initial}} claims {{made by the}} railway, the {{engineer}} that left the train unattended went to the explosion zone and uncoupled the last 9 undamaged tank cars that {{were still on the}} tracks {{at the end of the}} derailment. After uncoupling the tank cars, he used a rail car mover to pull them away from the derailment site. This version of events has been disputed by Lac-Mégantic's fire chief, who indicated that a volunteer firefighter had used a rail car mover borrowed from a local factory to remove these cars from danger. It was later revealed that two employees of Tafisa (Serge Morin, Sylvain Grégoire), a firefighter (Benoît Héon), the MMA engineer (Tom Harding) and a member of the family-owned excavation company Lafontaine and Son (Pascal Lafontaine) had worked to move 9 tank cars away from the fire. Tafisa, a local particleboard industry that moves much of its product by rail, has a rail car mover which has the capability to deactivate the brakes on the cars it tows. Morin, aided by his colleague Grégoire, used the rail car mover to move the first 5 tank cars away from the fire. When they could not find a level crossing to move the rail car mover back to the disaster site, they used a loader to remove another 4 tank cars, 2 at a time. Because the loader lacked equipment to deactivate railcar brakes, Harding told the men to use the loader to break the air lines on cars to release the air brakes on each of these four cars. Lafontaine's workers hauled gravel to the site, created firebreaks and blocked manholes as burning oil spread into the town's <b>storm</b> <b>sewer</b> system.|$|E

500|$|A small dam {{was built}} about [...] {{downstream}} of Aliso Creek Road in the 1990s—inside Aliso Canyon—as {{part of a}} [...] "mitigation bank project". This project, known as ACWHEP (Aliso Creek Wildlife Habitat Enhancement Project) was intended to provide water to [...] of former riparian areas now several feet higher than the eroded channel of the creek. It was conceived and jointly funded by the county and the Mission Viejo Company. The dam was also supposed to control further erosion downstream. Due to faulty design, however, the dam failed to prevent erosion, which has continued to undermine structures throughout the canyon. The grouted riprap structure is about [...] high and [...] long, and aside from impounding water, captures debris and temporarily controls wet season flows.
