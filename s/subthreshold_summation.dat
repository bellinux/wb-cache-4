40|$|<b>Subthreshold</b> <b>summation</b> between {{physical}} target lines and illusory contours induced by edges {{such as those}} produced in the Kanizsa illusion {{has been reported in}} previous studies. Here, we investigated the ability of line-induced illusory contours, using Ehrenstein figures, to produce similar <b>subthreshold</b> <b>summation.</b> In the first experiment, three stimulus conditions were presented. The target line was superimposed on the illusory contour of a four-arm Ehrenstein figure, or the target was presented between two dots (which replaced the arms of the Ehrenstein figure), or the target was presented on an otherwise blank screen (control). Detection of the target line was significantly worse when presented on the illusory contour (on the Ehrenstein figure) than when presented between two dots. This result was consistent for both curved and straight target lines, as well as for a 100 ms presentation duration and unlimited presentation duration. Performance was worst in the control condition. The results for the three stimulus conditions were replicated in a second experiment in which an eight-arm Ehrenstein figure was used to produce a stronger and less ambiguous illusory contour. In the third experiment, the target was either superimposed on the illusory contour, or was located across the central gap (illusory surface) of the Ehrenstein figure, collinear with two arms of the figure. As in the first two experiments, the target was either presented on the Ehrenstein figure, or between dots, or on a blank screen. Detection was better in the dot condition than in the Ehrenstein condition, regardless of whether the target was presented on the illusory contour or collinear with the arms of the Ehrenstein figure. These three experiments demonstrate the ability of reduced spatial uncertainty to facilitate the detection of a target line, but do not provide any evidence for <b>subthreshold</b> <b>summation</b> between a physical target line and the illusory contours produced by an Ehrenstein figure. The incongruence of these results with previous findings on Kanizsa figures is discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractResults {{from three}} {{experiments}} using spatial forced-choice techniques show that an illusory contour improves the detectability of a spatially superimposed, thin subthreshold line of either contrast polarity. Furthermore, the subthreshold line {{is found to}} enhance the visibility of the illusory contour. Stimuli which do not induce illusory contours, but reduce uncertainty about the spatial position of the line, {{give rise to a}} slight detection facilitation, but the threshold of 75 % correct responses is not attained. The data indicate that superimposing illusory contours and subthreshold lines produces interactions which are similar to classic <b>subthreshold</b> <b>summation.</b> They thus provide psychophysical evidence for the functional equivalence of illusory contours and real lines suggested by recent neurophysiological findings...|$|E
40|$|Two {{techniques}} are described {{which have been}} used to investigate mechanisms underlying the perception of velocity. The first, <b>subthreshold</b> <b>summation</b> establishes detection thresholds of two gratings of different spatial frequencies moving at the same velocity and also the detection thresholds of combinations of these gratings. The second technique employed a detection/dis-crimination procedure which establishes the discriminability of two different moving gratings at detection threshold. These experiments suggest that at low velocities the detection of 2 and 6 cycle/degree gratings is mediated by independent mechanisms, this independence being di-minished at higher velocities. Gratings of 2 cycles/degree but moving at different velocities are only discriminably different at detection threshold when widely separated in velocity...|$|E

40|$|Basal {{dendrites}} {{receive the}} majority of synapses that contact neocortical pyramidal neurons, yet our knowledge of synaptic processing in these dendrites has been hampered by their inaccessibility for electrical recordings. A new approach to patch-clamp recordings enabled us to characterize the integrative properties of these cells. Despite the short physical length of rat basal dendrites, synaptic inputs were electrotonically remote from the soma (> 30 -fold excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) attenuation) and back-propagating action potentials were significantly attenuated. Unitary EPSPs were location dependent, reaching large amplitudes distally (> 8 mV), yet their somatic contribution was relatively location independent. Basal dendrites support sodium and NMDA spikes, but not calcium spikes, for 75 % of their length. This suggests that basal dendrites, despite their proximity {{to the site of}} action potential initiation, do not form a single basal-somatic region but rather should be considered as a separate integrative compartment favoring two integration modes: <b>subthreshold,</b> location-independent <b>summation</b> versus local amplification of incoming spatiotemporally clustered information...|$|R
40|$|Ih is an {{important}} contributor to the subthreshold membrane properties of various mammalian neurons, including interneurons. Here I characterize the properties of Ih in a subpopulation of hippocampal area CA 3 interneurons with somata in stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosom moleculare. As shown in previous studies, Ih in these cells has sigmoidal voltage dependence of activation with kinetics characterized by two exponential components for both channel activation and deactivation. Interestingly, the activation and deactivation kinetics were most aptly described by distinct functions of voltage. These results were incorporated into a novel biophysical model of Ih that was applied in single compartment model simulations and dynamic clamp experiments. Finally, I assessed the functional consequences of Ih by examining {{the effects of this}} current on <b>subthreshold</b> temporal <b>summation</b> of mossy fiber EPSPs as well as frequency dependent neuronal responses.

We applied a single-channel energy model and a multiple-channels probability-summation model to explore subthreshold-summation phenomena. We measured the contrast thresholds for detection of two superimposed Gabor patches {{as a function of}} the spatial-frequency and orientation difference between the components. The stimuli were centred 7. 5 deg above the fixation point and were windowed by a Gaussian function with one of two different spatial spreads. We have shown that the spatial-frequency and orientation selectivity in <b>subthreshold</b> <b>summation</b> of Gabor patches is determined by the similarity (cross-correlation) between the stimulus components.

Stimuli were Gaussian enveloped 1 c/d sinusoidal gratings represented in a 3 D cardinal space transformed from cone contrast axes, and normalized to detection threshold. The use of this space avoids the presence of elongated threshold contours, allowing a reliable model fit to include the less sensitive blue-yellow and luminance mechanisms. Our results were well fitted by the probability summation model and hence support the underlying stochastic independence of the three postreceptoral mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{provide a}} {{comprehensive}} quantitative model of contrast discrimination, we measured contrast discrimination functions at four mean luminances, four spatial frequencies, three phase relations between tests and pedestal gratings, and two temporal frequencies {{for the test}} grating. The results confirm previous findings that {{the shape of the}} contrast discrimination function varies with three of these variables but is independent of luminance when each discrimination threshold is divided by the detection threshold for the test grating presented alone. The data in this 5 -dimensional space can be described quantitatively if expressed in amplitudes instead of contrasts. The resulting model of visual amplitude sensitivity has seven parameters that are specific to a particular observer and are tied to identifiable visual properties. The “pedestal effect” and tests with the pedestal and test gratings out-of-phase can be explained by <b>subthreshold</b> <b>summation</b> but not stimulus uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|Glass {{microelectrode}} recordings {{were made}} from single fibres of the posterior ampullary nerve in the isolated labyrinth of the frog (Rana esculenta). Potentials were recorded both at rest and during rotatory stimulation of the canal. At rest, the tracings revealed an intense background of small, largely summated potentials (0. 5 - 10 mV amplitude, 3 - 6 msec duration), which underlay the discharge of spikes in all the impaled units. The frequency of the subthreshold events {{was related to the}} frequency of the propagated spikes, the latter ranging from 0 to 40 /sec. Stimulation modulated the frequency of both spikes and <b>subthreshold</b> potentials, whose <b>summation</b> during excitation led to a positive shift of the fibre membrane potential. The small potentials proved to be dependent on Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + levels in the bath. Antidromic-stimulation of the posterior ampullary nerve indicated that the observed events do not represent an artifact due to extracellular field interference related to spike activity in the neighbouring fibres. Tetrodotoxin (10 (- 7) - 10 (- 6) g/ml) applied externally to the preparation or previously perfused through the frog vessels abolishes the propagated spikes but left unaffected the small potentials which, even under drug treatment, were normally modulated by the stimulus. The subthreshold potentials thus appear to be EPSPs generated at the cyto-neural junction between the hair cells and the endings of the ampullary nerve fibres...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{visual system}} {{consists}} of parallel processing channels whose separation, proposed by psychophysicists, is sometimes doubted {{in view of}} the multi-modal responses of many visual cortical neurons. Thus psychophysical experiments should be designed to test critically whether or not the threshold detection mechanisms are independent and can serve to identify those stimuli that are detected. To achieve this aim the stimuli should be selective to the mechanisms tested, with minimum intrusions due to the activation of the other mechanisms. Threshold performance is examined using psychometric functions evaluating both probability of detection and discrimination and then computing thresholds for both. A 'labelled detector ' is defined when the detection and discrimination thresholds are close; for example, edge and line can be identified at their detection thresholds. Spatial arrangements of line and edge detectors can be mapped using a method of <b>subthreshold</b> <b>summation</b> (the 'dipper effect').

40|$|Depth from {{binocular}} disparity and motion parallax {{has traditionally been}} assumed to be the product of separate and independent processes. We report two experiments which used classical psychophysical paradigms to test this assumption. The first tested whether there was an elevation in the thresholds for detecting the 3 D structure of corrugated surfaces defined by either {{binocular disparity}} or motion parallax following prolonged viewing (adaptation) of supra-threshold surfaces defined by either the same or a different cue (threshold elevation). The second experiment tested whether the depth detection thresholds for a compound stimulus, containing both binocular disparity and motion parallax, were lower than the thresholds determined {{for each of the}} components separately (sub-threshold summation). Experiment 1 showed a substantial amount of within- and between-cue threshold elevation and experiment 2 revealed the presence of <b>subthreshold</b> <b>summation.</b> Together, these results support the view that the combination of binocular disparity and motion parallax information is not limited to a linear, weighted addition of their individual depth estimates but that the cues can interact non-linearly in the computation of depth...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that optic flow - the smooth {{transformation}} of the retinal image experienced by a moving observer - contains valuable information about the three-dimensional layout of the environment. From psychophysical and neurophysiological experiments, specialised mechanisms responsive to components of optic flow (sometimes called complex motion) such as expansion and rotation have been inferred. However, it remains unclear (a) whether the visual system has mechanisms for processing the component of deformation and (b) whether there are multiple mechanisms that function independently from each other. Here, we investigate these issues using random-dot patterns and a forced-choice <b>subthreshold</b> <b>summation</b> technique. In experiment 1, we manipulated the size of a test region that was permitted to contain signal and found substantial spatial summation for signal components of translation, expansion, rotation, and deformation embedded in noise. In experiment 2, little or no summation was found for the superposition of orthogonal pairs of complex motion patterns (eg expansion and rotation), consistent with probability summation between pairs of independent detectors. Our results suggest that optic-flow components are detected by mechanisms that are specialised for particular patterns of complex motion...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the mechanisms of}} visual motion processing in humans. Previous research had shown the human visual system decomposes moving images {{by a set of}} spatio-temporal frequency selective mechanisms which do not unambiguously encode the velocity of moving patterns. By pooling the outputs of these mechanisms which have frequency selectivity lying on a common plane in spatio-temporal frequency space, the visual system can encode pattern velocities. The goal of this research was to investigate whether the visual system uses such pooling. ^ We designed a novel set of stimuli which are optimal for pattern motion detectors. By comparing detection performance on these stimuli against a set of control stimuli, we found evidence for pooling. A trial by trial perturbation analysis of this data was used to determine the observers 2 ̆ 7 pooling strategies, which showed at least two distinct kinds of frequency weighting, narrow band in orientation and broad band with weights restricted to a common plane.

40|$|Neurons {{integrate}} inputs {{arriving in}} different cellular compartments to produce action potentials that are transmitted to other neurons. Because of the voltage- and time-dependent conductances in the dendrites and soma, summation of synaptic inputs is complex. To examine summation of membrane potentials and firing rates, we performed whole-cell recordings from layer 5 cortical pyramidal neurons in acute slices of the rat’s somatosensory cortex. We delivered subthreshold and suprathreshold stimuli at the soma and several {{sites on the}} apical dendrite, and injected inputs that mimic synaptic barrages at individual or distributed sites. We found that summation of subthreshold potentials differed from that of firing rates. <b>Subthreshold</b> <b>summation</b> was linear when barrages were small but became supralinear as barrages increased. When neurons were discharging repetitively the rules were more diverse. At the soma and proximal apical dendrite summation of the evoked firing rates was predominantly sublinear whereas in the distal dendrite summation ranged from supralinear to sublinear. In addition, the integration of inputs delivered at a single location differed from that of distributed inputs only for suprathreshold responses. These results indicate that convergent inputs onto the apical dendrite and soma do not simply summate linearly, as suggested previously, and that distinct presynaptic afferents that target specific sites on the dendritic tree may perform unique sets of computations...|$|E

When d= 180 ° we found summation to be greater than probability summation for expansion, rotation and translation, consistent with the idea that mechanisms for these stimuli are constructed from subunits responsive to relative motion.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that blur and contrast discrimination thresholds are limited by a common stage of contrast energy transduction, and that this explains the characteristic “dipper” functions found for contrast and blur discrimination. To test this conjecture, thresholds for discriminating increments from decrements in sharpness/blur, and similarly for contrast, were measured using the same chessboard stimuli with the Method of Single Stimuli (Experiment 1). Using a generic human contrast sensitivity function (HCSF) to calculate energy, thresholds were significantly lower for blur than for contrast. They could be made more similar only by using an implausibly narrow band-pass version of the HCSF. In separate sessions (Experiment 2), observers also attempted to discriminate between blur and contrast changes when they were randomly interleaved (channel discrimination). Channel discrimination thresholds were similar to those predicted from noisy independent channels, consistent with separate labeled lines for the two channels. Experiment 3 measured <b>subthreshold</b> <b>summation</b> of contrast and blur signals, in either energy-add or energy-subtract modes with a two-alternative forced choice task. Both add and subtract modes lowered thresholds. Experiment 4 measured standard T versus C (“dipper”) functions for blur, and compared these with T versus C functions when a contrast cue was added to keep energy constant.

40|$|Findings that illusory {{contours}} {{can facilitate}} visual detection of a subthreshold real line (Dresp & Bonnet, 1995) were not replicated, when line-induced instead of edge-induced illusory contour stimuli were used (Salvano-Pardieu et al., 2006). Rather, {{the results of}} the latter study supported the importance of spatial cues. The present study was designed to investigate whether spatial cueing might also facilitate detection of targets superimposed on edge-induced illusory contours. In Experiment 1, a target line was superimposed on the illusory contour of a Kanizsa square, presented between dots with a precise or distant location to the target, or on a homogeneous field (control). Detection of the target was poorest for the control, followed by the distant-dots and Kanizsa conditions, whereas it was best for precisely cueing dots. Experiment 2 replicated the conditions in Experiment 1 (Kanizsa, precisely cueing dots, and control) with additional controls for possible luminance effects. The two new conditions matched the Kanizsa condition for overall luminance and preciseness of spatial cueing without generating illusory contours. Performance was best in the dot condition and worst in the control, but the same across the Kanizsa and matched luminance conditions. In Experiments 3 and 4, the stimuli presented were matched more closely to those used by Dresp and Bonnet, but still the results confirmed those obtained in our Experiments I and 2. Together, these experiments strongly suggest that detection is also facilitated by spatial cueing rather than <b>subthreshold</b> <b>summation,</b> in the case of edge-induced illusory contours...|$|E
40|$|The classic {{hypothesis}} of Livingstone and Hubel (1984, 1987) proposed {{two types of}} color pathways in primate visual cortex based on recordings from single cells: a segregated, modular pathway that signals color but provides little information about shape or form and a second pathway that signals color differences and so defines forms without the need to specify their colors. A major problem has been to reconcile this neurophysiological hypothesis with the behavioral data. A wealth of psychophysical studies has demonstrated that color vision has orientation-tuned responses and little impairment on form related tasks, but these have not revealed any direct evidence for nonoriented mechanisms. Here we use a psychophysical method of <b>subthreshold</b> <b>summation</b> across orthogonal orientations for isoluminant red-green gratings in monocular and dichoptic viewing conditions to differentiate between nonoriented and orientation-tuned responses to color contrast. We reveal nonoriented color responses at low spatial frequencies (0. 25 – 0. 375 c/deg) under monocular conditions changing to orientation-tuned responses at higher spatial frequencies (1. 5 c/deg) and under binocular conditions. We suggest that two distinct pathways coexist in color vision at the behavioral level, revealed at different spatial scales: one is isotropic, monocular, and best equipped for the representation of surface color, {{and the other is}} orientation-tuned, binocular, and selective for shape and form. This advances our understanding of the organization of the neural pathways involved in human color vision and provides a strong link between neurophysiological and behavioral data...|$|E
40|$|Classical {{studies of}} area {{summation}} measure contrast detection thresholds {{as a function}} of grating diameter. Unfortunately, (i) this approach is compromised by retinal inhomogeneity and (ii) it potentially confounds summation of signal with summation of internal noise. The Swiss cheese stimulus of T. S. Meese and R. J. Summers (2007) and the closely related Battenberg stimulus of T. S. Meese (2010) were designed to avoid these problems by keeping target diameter constant and modulating interdigitated checks of first-order carrier contrast within the stimulus region. This approach has revealed a contrast integration process with greater potency than the classical model of spatial probability summation. Here, we used Swiss cheese stimuli to investigate the spatial limits of contrast integration over a range of carrier frequencies (1 – 16 c/deg) and raised plaid modulator frequencies (0. 25 – 32 cycles/check). <b>Subthreshold</b> <b>summation</b> for interdigitated carrier pairs remained strong (~ 4 to 6 dB) up to 4 to 8 cycles/check. Our computational analysis of these results implied linear signal combination (following square-law transduction) over either (i) 12 carrier cycles or more or (ii) 1. 27 deg or more. Our model has three stages of summation: short-range summation within linear receptive fields, medium-range integration to compute contrast energy for multiple patches of the image, and long-range pooling of the contrast integrators by probability summation. Our analysis legitimizes the inclusion of widespread integration of signal (and noise) within hierarchical image processing models. It also confirms the individual differences in the spatial extent of integration that emerge from our approach...|$|E
40|$|To {{extend our}} {{understanding}} of the early visual hierarchy, we investigated the long-range integration of first- and second-order signals in spatial vision. In our first experiment we performed a conventional area summation experiment where we varied the diameter of (a) luminance-modulated (LM) noise and (b) contrast-modulated (CM) noise. Results from the LM condition replicated previous findings with sine-wave gratings in the absence of noise, consistent with long-range integration of signal contrast over space. For CM, the summation function was much shallower than for LM suggesting, at first glance, that the signal integration process was spatially less extensive than for LM. However, an alternative possibility was that the high spatial frequency noise carrier for the CM signal was attenuated by peripheral retina (or cortex), thereby impeding our ability to observe area summation of CM in the conventional way. To test this, we developed the “Swiss cheese” stimulus of Meese and Summers (2007) in which signal area can be varied without changing the stimulus diameter, providing some protection against inhomogeneity of the retinal field. Using this technique and a two-component <b>subthreshold</b> <b>summation</b> paradigm we found that (a) CM is spatially integrated over at least five stimulus cycles (possibly more), (b) spatial integration follows square-law signal transduction for both LM and CM and (c) the summing device integrates over spatially-interdigitated LM and CM signals when they are co-oriented, but not when cross-oriented. The spatial pooling mechanism that we have identified would be a good candidate component for a module involved in representing visual textures, including their spatial extent...|$|E

Similar experiments showed that none of the following were critical design features or stimulus parameters for our results: superposition of signal dots, limited life-time dots, the presence of speed gradients, stimulus size or the number of dots. A simplex algorithm was used to fit models containing mechanisms spaced at a pitch of either 90 ° (cardinal model) or 45 ° (cardinal+model) and combined using a fourth-root summation rule. For both models, direction half-bandwidth was equated for all mechanisms and was the only free parameter. Only the cardinal+model could account for the full set of results.

40|$|AbstractHuman texture {{vision has}} been modeled as a filter–rectify–filter (FRF) process, in which ‘ 2 nd-order’ filters detect {{changes in the}} {{rectified}} outputs of luminance-based ‘ 1 st-order’ filters. This study tested {{the validity of the}} two basic assumptions of the standard FRF model, namely (a) that the 2 nd-order filters are sensitive to spatial modulations in both contrast and orientation, and (b) that the 2 nd-order filters are tuned to different 1 st-order orientations. In the first experiment, we tested <b>subthreshold</b> <b>summation</b> between two orthogonal carrier orientations in detection of a texture region, which was defined by contrast modulations across regions in the two carrier orientations, while systematically varying the relative change magnitudes between the two orientations. The results showed that the detection thresholds were determined by spatial difference in the contrast integrated over the two orientations. Orientation difference did act as a segregation cue, but only when there was no differences in carrier contrast. This suggests that two mechanisms are involved in texture segregation; one that detects changes in luminance contrast and another that detects changes in orientation. To further analyze the latter mechanism, a second experiment measured cross-orientation summation in the detection of purely orientation-defined textures, using stimuli that were density modulations of two orientations presented among randomly-orientated distractors. Again, the relative modulation magnitudes between the two orientations was systematically varied. The results are consistent with the notions that (a) the dominant orientation is extracted from the 1 st-order outputs before the 2 nd-order process, and that (b) the 2 nd-order, spatial comparison process integrates those dominant signals over different orientations...|$|E

40|$|A {{model is}} {{proposed}} {{to account for}} the loss in visibility of moving targets that occurs when an observer is uncertain about the target's direction of motion. The model's key features are an array of directionally selective visual mechanisms and a rule governing the mechanisms from which an observer will derive sensory data. In response to uncertainty about two possible directions of motion, the observer is assumed to use a mechanism whose peak sensitivity is to a direction midway between the two possible directions. Seven experiments, using both reaction time and forced-choice data, demonstrate the predictive advantages of this midway model over competing single-band and multiple-band models. Additionally, the experiments reveal several new properties of human motion perception: (a) Direction and velocity information have orthogonal representations in the visual system; (b) although motion sensitivity does not vary with direction, the precision with which small changes in direction can be recognized does, reflecting differential breadth of tuning for directionally selective mechanisms sensitive to various directions; and (c) motion-analyzing mechanisms are broadly tuned for direction as well as speed. Human psychophysics provides extensive evidence for the existence of visual mechanisms tuned to different directions of motion. Converging on this point are data from a variety of paradigms including selective adaptation (Sekuler & Ganz, 1963), <b>subthreshold</b> <b>summation</b> (Levinson & Sekuler, 1975), and aftereffects (Keck, Palella, & Pantle, 1976). In addition, we recently used a masking procedure to define the direction sensitivity profiles of these mechanisms (Ball & Sekuler, 1979). In general, these studies tell us how much information is potentially available in motion-sensitive visual elements under ideal conditions. But they tell us little about the use to which that information can be put under nonideal conditions outside the laboratory...|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} study by Freeman et al (1996 b) {{has suggested that}} when complex patterns of motion elicit impressions of 2 -dimensionality, odd-item-out detection improves given targets can be differentiated {{on the basis of}} surface properties. Their results can be accounted for, it if is supposed that observers are permitted efficient access to 3 -D surface descriptions but access to 2 -D motion descriptions is restricted. To test the hypothesis, a standard search technique was employed, in which targets could be discussed on the basis of slant sign. In one experiment, slant impressions were induced through the summing of deformation and translation components. In a second theory were induced through the summing of shear and translation components. Neither showed any evidence of efficient access. A third experiment explored the possibility that access to these representations may have been hindered by a lack of grouping between the stimuli. Attempts to improve grouping failed to produce convincing evidence in support of life. An alternative explanation is that complex patterns of motion are simply not processed simultaneously. Psychophysical and physiological studies have, however, suggested that multiple mechanisms selective for complex motion do exist. Using a <b>subthreshold</b> <b>summation</b> technique I found evidence supporting the notion that complex motions are processed in parallel. Furthermore, in a spatial summation experiment, coherence thresholds were measured for displays containing different numbers of complex motion patches. Consistent with the idea that complex motion processing proceeds in parallel, increases in the number of motion patches were seen to decrease thresholds, both for expansion and rotation. Moreover, the rates of decrease were higher than those typically expected from probability summation, thus implying mechanisms are available, which can pool signals from spatially distinct complex motion flows.

Support for the existence of this 2 ̆ 7 AND 2 ̆ 7 mechanism has been provided by adaptation (Wolfe 2 ̆ 6 Held, 1981, 1982; Wilcox, Timney, 2 ̆ 6 St. John, 1990), and detection experiments (Cohn 2 ̆ 6 Lasley, 1976; Cogan, 1987).;In predicting the results of adaptation experiments several investigators have adopted a 2 ̆ 7 neural averaging 2 ̆ 7 hypothesis which proposes that the output from all available monocular and binocular channels is averaged to produce the final percept. Experiments I and II evaluated this suggestion and a second proposal that all channels are independent, and that detection is mediated by the most sensitive of these channels. The results of both studies showed that there is interaction between the neural channels.;While there is convincing support for the existence of an AND channel, little is known about its response characteristics. Experiments III through V examined the temporal aspects, threshold sensitivity, and interocular spatial phase sensitivity, of an AND mechanism. Collectively, these experiments support the assumption that the AND channel requires binocular stimuli that are similar along a number of dimensions. The final experiment investigated a potential functional role of the AND mechanism in human vision. In this study, both adaptation and <b>subthreshold</b> <b>summation</b> procedures were used to assess the contribution of the AND channel to binocular summation. The results demonstrated that an AND mechanism makes a significant contribution to binocular summation.;It has been argued previously (Wolfe, 1986) that an AND mechanism is important to stereoscopic vision. Given Wolfe 2 ̆ 7 s assertions and the results of Experiment VI, it appears that the output of the AND channel is not necessarily restricted to a single process, but could contribute to several visual tasks, including binocular summation and stereopsis...|$|E
40|$|The present set of {{experiments}} used adaptation procedures to explore binocularity in individuals with abnormal binocular vision. The first series {{of experiments}} examined interocular transfer because this measure has been used previously to test {{for the presence of}} binocular neurons (Movshon, Chambers and Blakemore, 1972). Experiment I examined the test-retest reliability of this measure. Interocular transfer was found to be reliable. The results of Experiments II-IV clearly show that individuals with anomalous early visual history (A. E. H.) are capable of interocular transfer of a magnitude associated with normals.;Experiments III and IV also addressed the organization of binocular channels in individuals with varying levels of stereopsis. The results from Experiment III supported the presence of two binocular channels in Normal subjects whereas the A. E. H. group showed evidence for only one binocular channel. This pattern of results for the A. E. H. group was not as clear in Experiment IV, but the Normal group displayed data consistent with two binocular channels.;A different paradigm, alternating monocular adaptation, was used in Experiments V and VI in a further attempt to evaluate the number of binocular channels present. The results from Experiment V were quite clear. Individuals without stereopsis showed evidence of only one binocular channel and the Normal group portrayed the pattern of results indicative of two binocular channels. The results From Experiment VI were equivocal regarding both the Normal and A. E. H. group.;Experiment VII revealed that all subjects of the A. E. H. group were capable of obtaining a level of binocular summation associated with probability summation. The Normals showed summation levels indicative of neural summation. In Experiment VIII, the data show that if the stimuli presented to each eye are not spatially matched, then summation decreases. However, this was true only for the Normal group. The Stereoblind group maintained a level of probability summation throughout the stimulus phase shifts. The final experiment used <b>subthreshold</b> <b>summation</b> and adaptation procedures to affect the purely binocular channel in order to reduce summation. Summation decreases after adaptation of this channel, but remains unchanged if this channel is not adapted. The results for the Stereoblind group were the same as the Normal group, suggesting that Stereoblinds maintain a binocular channel affected by simultaneous stimulation.;These results clearly show that individuals with anomalous early visual histories show evidence for binocular channels previously thought to be absent...|$|E
