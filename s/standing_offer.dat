From Paris, he went to Havana, arriving there on December 14, 1908, and his twice-a-day wrestling act quickly proved to be very popular. On July 23, 1909, Maeda left Havana for Mexico City. His debut in Mexico City {{took place at the}} Virginia Fabregas Theater on July 14, 1909. This show was a private demonstration for some military cadets. Shortly afterwards, Maeda began appearing at the Principal Theater. His <b>standing</b> <b>offer</b> was 100 pesos (US $50) to anyone he could not throw, and 500 pesos (US $250) to anyone who could throw him. The Mexican Herald did not record anyone taking his money.|$|E

The other possible contender for the title is Maze War, a maze game which ran on two connected computers at NASA in 1973 and was expanded to a full multiplayer game some time in 1974. Spasim is considered, along with Maze War, {{to be one of the}} [...] "joint ancestors" [...] of the first-person shooter genre, due to uncertainty over the relative release dates.|$|E

2500|$|The formal {{approach}} of English courts is that agreement exists when an offer is mirrored by an unequivocal {{acceptance of the}} terms on offer. Whether an offer has been made, or it has been accepted, is an issue courts determine by asking what a reasonable person would have thought was intended. Offers are distinguished from [...] "invitations to treat" [...] (or an invitatio ad offerendum, the invitation of an offer) which cannot be simply accepted by the other party. Traditionally, English law has viewed the display of goods in a shop, even with a price tag, as an invitation to treat, so that when a customer takes the product to the till it is she who is making the offer, and the shopkeeper may refuse to sell. Similarly, and as a very general rule, an advertisement, the invitation {{to make a bid}} at an auction with a reserve price, or the invitation to submit a tender bid are not considered offers. On the other hand, a person inviting tenders may fall under a duty to consider the submissions if they arrive before the deadline, so the bidder (even though there is no contract) could sue for damages if his bid is never considered. An auctioneer who publicises an auction as being without a reserve price falls under a duty to accept the highest bid. An automated vending machine constitutes a <b>standing</b> <b>offer,</b> and a court may construe an advertisement, or something on display like a deckchair, to be a serious offer if a customer would be led to believe they were accepting its terms by performing an action. Statute imposes criminal penalties for businesses that engage in misleading advertising, or not selling products at the prices they display in store, or unlawfully discriminating against customers on grounds of race, gender, sexuality, disability, belief or age. The Principles of European Contract Law article 2:201 suggests that most EU member states count a proposal to supply any good or service by a professional as an offer.|$|E

40|$|In this {{ground-breaking}} book, Guy <b>Standing</b> <b>offers</b> a {{new perspective}} on work and citizenship, rejecting the labourist orientation of the 20 th century.

Work and labour are being revolutionized by a Global Transformation that has seen {{the emergence of a new}} class structure, including a global 'precariat', alongside unsustainable inequalities and insecurities. Guy Standing argues against paternalistic policy responses in favour of an egalitarian strategy to build occupational citizenship, founded on full freedom and basic income security in which all forms of work can flourish. The book also explores a phasing out of labour law and a re-orientation of collective bargaining towards 'collaborative bargaining', to reflect the new realities in which relationships between groups of workers are as or more important in people's working lives as those between workers and capital...|$|R

But shortly after he failed so miserably with Captain Ashe, the boy came into possession of a priceless treasure. It was that little treatise on [...] "Greek and Roman Mythology" [...] which I have mentioned, and which he must literally have worn out with reading, since no fragment of it seems to have survived his boyhood. Heaven knows who wrote it or published it; his father bought it with a number of other books at an auction, and the boy, who had about that time discovered the chapter on prosody in the back part of his grammar, made poems from it for years, and appeared in many transfigurations, as this and that god and demigod and hero upon imagined occasions in the Boy's Town, to the fancied admiration of all the other fellows. I do not know just why he wished to appear to his grandmother in a vision; now as Mercury with winged feet, now as Apollo with his drawn bow, now as Hercules leaning upon his club and resting from his Twelve Labors. Perhaps it was because he thought that his grandmother, who used to tell the children about her life in Wales, and show them the picture of a castle where she had once slept when she was a girl, would appreciate him in these apotheoses. If he believed they would make a vivid impression upon the sweet old Quaker lady, no doubt he was right.|$|E
