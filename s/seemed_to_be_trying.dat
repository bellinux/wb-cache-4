500|$|Morgan's script {{turned out}} to be the most comedic episode of the series so far. The {{departure}} from The X-Files usual style made some of the crew, including director Kim Manners, uncomfortable, and some of the more explicitly comic scenes were cut. After [...] "Humbug", Morgan went on to write three more comedy-infused stories for the show: [...] "Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose", [...] "War of the Coprophages" [...] and [...] "Jose Chung's From Outer Space". David Duchovny later commented, [...] "what I loved about his scripts was that he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> to destroy the show." [...] The plot for [...] "Humbug" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1996 by Les Martin.|$|E
500|$|Darin Morgan {{had a small}} {{involvement}} in the second season, and was asked to contribute more content for the third. He first appeared in [...] "The Host" [...] as the Flukeman, and was brought on by his brother Glen Morgan to help write the episode [...] "Blood". Morgan's first sole credit as a writer came in the episode [...] "Humbug", which received a positive reception by the staff. David Duchovny expressed an enjoyment for working with Morgan, commenting [...] "what I loved about his scripts was that he <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> to destroy the show." [...] Morgan wrote {{a total of three}} episodes, but later left the series because he could not keep up with the fast-paced nature of network television. He also expressed a negative opinion of the way his teleplays were handled, despite a positive reception by both critics and the crew of his work. He also contributed to the script for the episode [...] "Quagmire". After writing one episode the previous season, Vince Gilligan returned to write another solo episode for the season, now credited as a creative consultant. Cast member David Duchovny collaborated with Howard Gordon and Chris Carter for two episodes receiving story credit.|$|E

2500|$|The {{guidelines}} were of even more importance, wrote King, since unlike Hoffman Estates, the ordinance {{had been passed}} by voters rather than city council and Austin's city charter forbade such initiatives from being amended or repealed for two years. The amended guidelines, she continued, [...] "essentially provide plaintiff bar owners and operators a clear 'how to' guide for avoiding a violation under the 'necessary steps' provision." [...] And some of those plaintiffs had not only received multiple notices of violation but <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> to find loopholes in it, such as making patrons sign written forms confirming {{that they had been}} instructed not to smoke inside but otherwise not discouraging them from doing so, and putting empty candleholders on tables instead of ashtrays. Inspectors who cited the bars for violations also circled steps that were not taken when providing notice. [...] "n light of the evidence at trial, Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate that the 'necessary steps' provision is so indefinite as to provide them with no standard of conduct at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2006, Evanescence {{performed}} an acoustic {{version of the}} song with a piano, a cello and a guitar at the AOL Music Sessions. On October 19, 2006, the band appeared at the awards show Los Premios MTV Latinoamérica 2006 in Mexico City, performing [...] "Call Me When You're Sober" [...] and [...] "Bring Me to Life". The song was later included on the set list of the band's The Open Door Tour (2006–07) in support of their second studio album. According to Donnie Moorhouse of The Republican, it receives a [...] "full band treatment" [...] during the performances. While reviewing a concert by the band, Milwaukee Journal Sentinels Jon M. Gilbertson said that the title [...] "pushes away from rock's party mood". However, he praised Lee's live performance of the song saying that she [...] "projected so loudly and clearly that she <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> to reach well {{beyond the confines of}} the Eagles Ballroom, and she hit the notes throughout the set. No screaming or growling, in other words." [...] Chris Harris of Rolling Stone described her performance of the song having [...] "everyone in the place headbanging along with Lee, whose hair whipped in circles wildly as she belted out the chorus". The Guardians Caroline Sullivan noted that for the [...] "doomy writhing and the darkness" [...] of the song, Lee [...] "cuts a triumphant figure".|$|E
2500|$|It {{originally}} required motorists {{to pay for}} the towing {{of their}} stalled vehicle, but at reduced prices set by the city. Tow truck drivers claimed that the program hurt their business and nine wrecker companies filed lawsuits against the city. White testified in court in the case. In addition the SafeClear Program has been blamed for causing the deaths of people, who <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>trying</b> to get their cars off the freeway without having to pay fees to the tow truck drivers. The cause of death of these people, however, is uncertain. State Senator John Whitmire recruited 30 out of 31 Texas State Senators' votes to make the SafeClear program illegal. White responded to the controversy and criticism by changing the rules of the program and the towing laws, including free towing for limited distances funded by the city. The program was adapted to include strict licensing of SafeClear wreckers including criminal background checks, allowing the towed motorist to be towed for one mile for free, preventing the City leasing stretches of state-owned highway to private wrecker companies, and requiring revenue generated from the program to enter a mobility fund. White also worked with John Whitmire to address the objections of the senators, keeping the program alive but in a different format. He also rode with a wrecker and conducted several studies of the program. Despite the controversy, independent studies have found that the program has helped. Studies show that the program has been successful in decreasing accidents. A study, conducted by Rice University and Texas A University found that the number of freeway crashes decreased by 10.4%, [...] or nearly 2,000 crashes. According to these results, drivers in Houston saved approximately $35 million by the implementation of the program. However Suzanne Poole, president of the Houston Professional Towing Association, says those numbers are misleading and actual crashes are actually higher. In reference to the program's objective to decrease traffic congestion, a study by KHOU-TV found that average drive times increased at 86% of freeways into Houston six months after the program was implemented compared to before the program. However, some claim that more cars were on the roads during these six months and that construction on the freeways, particularly on US 59, caused drive times to increase. Nonetheless, SafeClear remained one of the most controversial, and one of few controversies, during his time as mayor.|$|E
