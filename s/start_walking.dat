25|$|Symptoms {{most often}} first appear in early {{childhood}} (the toddler stage) when children begin to walk. Though they usually <b>start</b> <b>walking</b> at a normal age, they wobble or sway when walking, standing still or sitting, and may appear {{almost as if they}} are drunk. In late pre-school and early school age, they develop difficulty moving their eyes in a natural manner from one place to the next (oculomotor apraxia). They develop slurred or distorted speech, and swallowing problems. Some have an increased number of respiratory tract infections (ear infections, sinusitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia). Because not all children develop in the same manner or at the same rate, it may be some years before A-T is properly diagnosed. Most children with A-T have stable neurologic symptoms for the first 4–5 years of life, but begin to show increasing problems in early school years.|$|E
25|$|The {{breeding}} season for sloth bears {{varies according to}} location: in India, they mate in April, May, and June, and give birth in December and early January, while in Sri Lanka, it occurs all year. Sows gestate for 210 days, and typically give birth in caves or in shelters under boulders. Litters usually consist {{of one or two}} cubs, or rarely three. Cubs are born blind, and open their eyes after four weeks. Sloth bear cubs develop quickly compared to most other bear species: they <b>start</b> <b>walking</b> a month after birth, become independent at 24–36 months, and become sexually mature at the age of three years. Young cubs ride on their mother's back when she walks, runs, or climbs trees until they reach a third of her size. Individual riding positions are maintained by cubs through fighting. Intervals between litters can last two to three years.|$|E
25|$|The first {{indications}} of A-T usually occur during the toddler years. Children <b>start</b> <b>walking</b> at a normal age, {{but may not}} improve much from their initial wobbly gait. Sometimes they have problems standing or sitting still and tend to sway backward or from side to side. In primary school years, walking becomes more difficult, and children will use doorways and walls for support. Children with A-T often appear better when running or walking quickly in comparison to when they are walking slowly or standing in one place. Around {{the beginning of their}} second decade, children with typical forms of A-T start using a wheelchair for long distances. During school years, children may have increasing difficulty with reading because of impaired coordination of eye movement. At the same time, other problems with fine-motor functions (writing, coloring, and using utensils to eat), and with slurring of speech (dysarthria) may arise. Most of these neurologic problems stop progressing after the age of about 12 – 15 years, though involuntary movements may start at any age and may worsen over time. These extra movements can take many forms, including small jerks of the hands and feet that look like fidgeting (chorea), slower twisting movements of the upper body (athetosis), adoption of stiff and twisted postures (dystonia), occasional uncontrolled jerks (myoclonic jerks), and various rhythmic and non-rhythmic movements with attempts at coordinated action (tremors).|$|E

500|$|Gestation {{is nearly}} three months long. The number of cubs born can vary from one to eight, though the common number is three to five. Birth {{takes place in a}} {{sheltered}} place such as thick vegetation. Each cub weighs nearly [...] at birth; the eyes, shut at birth, open in 4to 11 days. Newborn cubs can crawl and spit; they can <b>start</b> <b>walking</b> by two weeks. Their nape, shoulders and back are thickly covered with long bluish grey hair. This downy underlying fur, called a [...] "mantle", gives them a Mohawk-type appearance; this fur is shed as the cheetah grows older. A study noted that this mane gives a cheetah cub the appearance of the honey badger; this could act as a camouflage in both animals. Cheetah cubs are highly vulnerable during the first few weeks of their life; mothers keep their cubs hidden in dense vegetation for the first month.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Williams {{waiting for his}} laundry {{to be done in}} a store, before getting out for a walk. Meanwhile, Barlow is {{standing}} {{on the other side of}} the street. As the song starts the two of them <b>start</b> <b>walking</b> towards their cars whilst looking at each other. When they get inside, the scenes are intercut with the two of them dancing with their female partners. Later in the video, they are shown sitting at the bar having a drink whilst singing the song's words. As the second chorus starts, Williams and Barlow are at a pond, fishing and laughing. Scenes of them looking each other secretly are also shown. In the middle of [...] "Shame"'s bridge they start taking their shirts off. Shortly, they are shown climbing up a cliffs. After they get on the top they want to jump, however, they realize it's too high. Instead they hug each other and walk away as the video finishes.|$|E
500|$|As {{the second}} {{rendition}} of the chorus begins, they go to an open field where they run through 10 banners in the quickest time ever of 9.19 s. Quickly after breaking their sixth world record, Williams breaks her first individual record, of doing the [...] "most cartwheels while wearing boots for 20 seconds" [...] by doing 7. The band members reunite and <b>start</b> <b>walking</b> backwards for 30 feet, while blindfolded and holding stuffed animals. This achievement is done by York in the fastest time ever of 6.14 seconds. For the penultimate record, Davis and York break the record of unwrapping a [...] "mummy" [...] in the least time; they unwrap Williams, who is covered in toilet paper, in 9.75 s. During the closing scene, Williams, York and Davis stand on a moving convertible, with Williams breaking the last record of screaming for the maximum time while in a convertible—for 8.48 s. The video concludes as it is revealed that [...] "Ain't It Fun" [...] itself holds the world record of depicting the most world records—10—broken in a music video.|$|E

500|$|Madonna also {{performed}} the song at the 2015 Brit Awards, on February 25. However, {{in the early}} stages of the performance, a wardrobe malfunction caused her to be pulled down a flight of stairs that made up part of the stage. It was later revealed that since her cape was tied tightly, when her dancers attempted to remove it from her neck, she fell down to the floor. However Madonna then continued the performance as planned. She later took to Instagram to confirm that she was well, posting [...] "Thanks for the good wishes! I'm fine". Richard Smirke from Billboard praised the performance and Madonna's recovery, saying that [...] " [...] didn't let the fall affect her performance and quickly recovered to deliver a slickly choreographed routine that mirrored the matador theme of her recent Grammy Awards performance." [...] Madonna explained on The Jonathan Ross Show that she was told to <b>start</b> <b>walking</b> towards the stage further than originally planned. Hence her team thought that the cape could have slid off and tied it tightly round her neck. The singer had two choices when the cape did not come undone, [...] "I could either be strangled or fall, and I chose to fall". Madonna endured a whiplash and added that she [...] "smacked the back of my head. And I had a man standing over me with a flashlight until about 3 am to make sure I was compos mentis". The singer jokingly added that she would not use any cape for further performances and attributed her prompt recovery to having good core strength and her daily exercise routine. The accident led to an increase in viewership of the awards show. According to the British Phonographic Industry, the event resulted a 95% increase in Twitter activity about the show compared with the previous year, with an exchange of 7.8million tweets, while 6.8million viewers tuned in to watch the performance. The singer's fall was voted the most shocking [...] "Celebrity Moment of 2015" [...] by UK's Channel 5.|$|E
2500|$|Tricklining {{has become}} {{the most common form of}} slacklining because of the easy setup of [...] {{slackline}} kits. Tricklining is often done low to the ground but can be done on highlines as well. A great number of tricks can be done on the line, and because the sport is fairly new, there is plenty of room for new tricks. Some of the basic tricks done today are walking, walking backwards, turns, drop knee, running and jumping onto the slackline to <b>start</b> <b>walking,</b> and bounce walking. Some intermediate tricks include: Buddha sit, sitting down, lying down, cross-legged knee drop, surfing forward, surfing sideways, and jump turns, or [...] "180s." [...] Some of the advanced tricks are: jumps, tree plants, jumping from line-to-line, 360s, butt bounces, and chest bounces. With advancements in webbing technology & tensioning systems, the limits for what can be done on a slackline are being pushed constantly. It is not uncommon to see expert slackliners incorporating flips and twists into slackline trick combinations.|$|E
2500|$|Of his {{direction}} of the film, Bakshi stated, [...] "My approach to animation as a director is live action. I don't approach it in the traditional animation ways. None of our characters get up and sing, because that's {{not the type of}} picture I'm trying to do. I want people to believe my characters are real, and it's hard to believe they're real if they <b>start</b> <b>walking</b> down the street singing." [...] Bakshi wanted the film to be the antithesis of any animated film produced by the Walt Disney Company. Accordingly, Fritz the Cat includes two satirical references to Disney. In one scene, silhouettes of Mickey Mouse, Daisy Duck, and Donald Duck are shown cheering on the United States Air Force as it drops napalm on a black neighborhood during a riot. Another scene features a reference to the [...] "Pink Elephants on Parade" [...] sequence from Dumbo. A sequence of the camera panning across a garbage heap in an abandoned lot in Harlem sets up a visual device which recurs in Hey Good Lookin'.|$|E

2500|$|The {{game was}} first shown the {{following}} week, at the 2002 E3 event, where a playable demo was made available. Whilst no narrative or story elements {{were in place}} yet, the demo featured environments from the Virescent Village level and the refinery level. Midway stressed the free-roaming nature of the game, saying [...] "you can fully roam throughout the large environments on the ground, then get into a spaceship, point it {{at the sky and}} climb to outer space. Up there, you'll be able to do battle with whatever's mean, then return to the ground and <b>start</b> <b>walking</b> around again." [...] GameSpot's Gerald Villoria wrote of this aspect of the demo [...] "the planet and all the explorable areas in Haven are seamlessly linked--traveling from one area of the world to the next should incur no game stoppage due to load times. In fact, when Haven gains access to his flying vessel, he can literally rise above the planet's atmosphere and explore any of the continents. The landmasses smoothly raise in level of detail as the descending aircraft approaches, with nearly featureless topography slowly morphing into fully landscaped wilderness until the ship can literally hover above the treetops." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mathis {{had worn}} his trunks very high, {{so that when}} Joe hit Mathis with {{legitimate}} body shots, the referee took {{a dim view of}} them. In the second round, the referee had {{gone so far as to}} penalize Joe two points for hitting below the belt. [...] "In a three-round bout a man can't afford a points deduction like that," [...] Joe would say. Joe then returned to Philadelphia feeling as low as he'd ever been and was even thinking of giving up boxing. Duke Dugent and his trainer Yank Durham were able to talk Joe out of his doldrums and even suggested Joe make the trip to Tokyo as an alternate, in case something happened to Mathis. Joe agreed and while there, he was a workhorse, sparring with any of the Olympic boxers who wanted some action. [...] "Middleweight, light heavyweight, it didn't matter to me, I got in there and boxed all comers" [...] Joe would say. In contrast, Mathis was slacking off. In the morning, when the Olympic team would do their roadwork, Mathis would run a mile, then <b>start</b> <b>walking</b> saying [...] "Go ahead, big Joe. I'll catch up." [...] His amateur record was 38–2.|$|E
2500|$|Another Midrash {{taught that}} {{the words of the}} Torah give light to those who study them, but those who do not occupy {{themselves}} with the Torah stumble. The Midrash compared this to those who stand in the dark; as soon as they <b>start</b> <b>walking,</b> they stumble, fall, and knock their face on the ground – all because they have no lamp in their hand. It is the same with those who have no Torah; they strike against sin, stumble, and die. The Midrash further taught that those who study the Torah give forth light wherever they may be. Quoting [...] "Your word is a lamp to my feet, and a light to my path," [...] and [...] "The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord," [...] the Midrash taught that God offers people to let God's lamp (the Torah) be in their hand and their lamp (their souls) be in God's hand. The lamp of God is the Torah, as [...] says, [...] "For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching is light." [...] The commandment is [...] "a lamp" [...] because those who perform a commandment kindle a light before God and revive their souls, as [...] says, [...] "The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord." ...|$|E
