50|$|De Thuin's {{method of}} sale {{was to use}} one of his aliases to <b>send</b> sheets of <b>approvals</b> to {{collectors}}, mainly in the United States, which mixed a few genuine common stamps with forgeries of rarer items. Many collectors were duped and in 1962 a London sale of 498 lots of classic Mexico belonging to Prof. Hormer Lizama was cancelled when the sale was revealed to consist mainly of de Thuin fakes.|$|R
50|$|Within 45 {{days after}} the CCAA sent the referral, the {{prospective}} adopters must notify the CCAA, via their adoption agency, {{whether or not they}} have chosen to accept the referral. If the prospective adopters reject the referral, they must provide a justified explanation to the CCAA; otherwise, the CCAA may withdraw their application for Chinese adoption. If the prospective parents accept a referral, the CCAA will <b>send</b> them an <b>approval</b> notice (Notice of Coming to China for Adoption).|$|R
25|$|In <b>sending</b> the pope's <b>approval</b> {{of these}} decrees, the prefect of the Propaganda {{congregation}} exhorted the bishops {{to add the}} feasts of the Circumcision of Our Lord and the Immaculate Conception B.V.M. to the festivals already observed. He added that although some diversity as to fasts and feasts {{is found in the}} American dioceses, still it is not desirable to lessen the number in those places where they are in accord with the discipline of the universal Church, because fewer feasts are observed in other American dioceses.|$|R
40|$|Distribution: F This {{instruction}} implements AFPD 44 - 1, Medical Operations, {{and provides}} guidance {{for the organization}} and delivery of community based, prevention focused, healthcare.

5000|$|If the {{students}} from Shao Nian Ban {{want to take}} the National Higher Education Entrance Examination, their schools need to pre-select, <b>send</b> certification of <b>approval,</b> inform the exact required courses, and clarify the offices of Admissions Committee where they will take the National Higher Education Entrance Examination. After doing so, {{the students}} can then give the application. After the Office of Admissions Committee reviews and approves, they can apply for and attend the National Higher Education Entrance Examination at the right location. Students who apply for Shao Nian Ban must be part of the small percentage of the population. They have very high IQ, their grades are excellent, and they study at a secondary or high school under the age of 15(not including those who are going to graduate this year and has studied in high school for the first time).|$|R
25|$|List of kulaks {{were to be}} {{prepared}} by local executive committees and officially approved by the Council of Ministers, but due to the tight deadline and top secret nature of the task, local MGB offices compiled their own lists of kulaks. This caused much confusion during the operation. Local MGB offices would prepare summary certificates for each family and <b>send</b> them for <b>approval</b> to the republican MGB office. For example, by 14 March, Estonian MGB approved summary certificates for 9,407 families (3,824 kulaks and 5,583 nationalists and bandits) which created a reserve of 1,907 families above the quota. Overall, {{due to the lack}} of time, the files on deportees were often incomplete or incorrect. Therefore, from April to June, retrospective corrections were made â€“ new files were added for people deported but not on deportee lists and files of those who escaped deportations were removed.|$|R
5000|$|On 8 May, Kurdish Natural Resources Minister Ashti Hawrami announced, [...] "Today I {{received}} an email {{message from the}} Iraqi Oil Ministry <b>sending</b> us their <b>approval</b> for the Kurdish Government to export oil through the Iraqi pipelines to Ceyhan Turkey." [...] Iraqi Oil Ministry spokesman Asim Jihad initially denied that these first official exports of Kurdish oil had been permitted but later confirmed that, [...] "the Iraqi Oil Ministry will start exporting crude extracted from some oil-fields in Kurdistan." [...] Turkey's Genel Enerji Project Manager Mehmet Okutan, who is leading the joint development of Taq Taq in what {{is seen as a}} sign of growing trust in Kurd's ties with Turkey, stated, [...] "We consider the start of the exports as a historic moment for us," [...] with Turkish Democratic Society Party (DTP) Deputy Hasip Kaplan adding, [...] "The good economic and social relations between Turkey and the Iraqi Kurds will serve peace efforts." ...|$|R
40|$|The Mission Planning Division of the Mission Operations Laboratory at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center is {{responsible}} for scheduling experiment activities for space missions controlled at MSFC. In order to draw statistically relevant conclusions, all experiments must be scheduled at least once and may have repeated performances during the mission. An experiment consists {{of a series of}} steps which, when performed, provide results pertinent to the experiment's functional objective. Since these experiments require a set of resources such as crew and power, the task of creating a timeline of experiment activities for the mission is one of resource constrained scheduling. For each experiment, a computer model with detailed information of the steps involved in running the experiment, including crew requirements, processing times, and resource requirements is created. These models are then loaded into the Experiment Scheduling Program (ESP) which attempts to create a schedule which satisfies all resource constraints. ESP uses a depth-first search technique to place each experiment into a time interval, and a scoring function to evaluate the schedule. The mission planners generate several schedules and choose one with a high value of the scoring function to <b>send</b> through the <b>approval</b> process. The process of approving a mission timeline can take several months. Each timeline must meet the requirements of the scientists, the crew, and various engineering departments as well as enforce all resource restrictions. No single objective is considered in creating a timeline. The experiment scheduling problem is: given a set of experiments, place each experiment along the mission timeline so that all resource requirements and temporal constraints are met and the timeline is acceptable to all who must approve it. Much work has been done on multicriteria decision making (MCDM). When there are two criteria, schedules which perform well with respect to one criterion will often perform poorly with respect to the other. One schedule dominates another if it performs strictly better on one criterion, and no worse on the other. Clearly, dominated schedules are undesireable. A nondominated schedule can be generated by some sort of optimization problem. Generally there are two approaches: the first is a hierarchical approach while the second requires optimizing a weighting or scoring function...|$|R
