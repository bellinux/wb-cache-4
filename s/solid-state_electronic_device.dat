Under the influence of an external voltage, both the electron and the hole can move across the material.

These types of images should be useful to allow for experimental verification of resolution limits in CL and EBIC associated with interaction volume effects in bulk materials and can be obtained without additional sample preparation. Finally, several suggestions for further research are offered, including mapping of radiation damage in solar cells, near-contact E field mapping and studies of low-dimensional structures such as superlattices and quantum wires.

50|$|Space {{charge is}} a concept in which excess {{electric}} charge is treated as a continuum of charge distributed over a region of space (either a volume or an area) rather than distinct point-like charges. This model typically applies when charge carriers have been emitted from some region of a solid—the cloud of emitted carriers can form a space charge region if they are sufficiently spread out, or the charged atoms or molecules {{left behind in the}} solid can form a space charge region. Space charge usually only occurs in dielectric media (including vacuum) because in a conductive medium the charge tends to be rapidly neutralized or screened. The sign of the space charge can be either negative or positive. This situation is perhaps most familiar in the area near a metal object when it is heated to incandescence in a vacuum. This effect was first observed by Thomas Edison in light bulb filaments, where it is sometimes called the Edison effect, but space charge is a significant phenomenon in many vacuum and <b>solid-state</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{investigation}} of paramagnetic species (such as point defects, dopants, and impurities) in <b>solid-state</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> {{is significant because}} of their effect on device performance. Conventionally, these species are detected and imaged using the electron spin resonance (ESR) technique. In many instances, ESR is not sensitive {{enough to deal with}} miniature devices having small numbers of paramagnetic species and high spatial heterogeneity. This limitation can in principle be overcome by employing a more sensitive method called electrically-detected magnetic resonance, which is based on measuring the effect of paramagnetic species on the electric current of the device while inducing electron spin-flip transitions. However, up until now, measurement of the current of the device could not reveal the spatial heterogeneity of its paramagnetic species. We provide here, for the first time, high resolution microimages of paramagnetic species in operating solar cells obtained through electrically-detected magnetic resonance. The method is based on unique microwave pulse sequences for excitation and detection of the electrical signal under a static magnetic field and powerful pulsed magnetic field gradients that spatially encode the electrical current of the sample.

The controllable epitaxy of CuI thin films allows for the combination of p-type CuI with suitable n-type semiconductors with the purpose to fabricate epitaxial thin film heterojunctions.

40|$|With {{advances}} in <b>solid-state</b> power <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> and microprocessors, various pulse-width-modulation (PWM) techniques {{have been developed}} for industrial applications. For example, PWM-based three-phase voltage source inverters (VSI) convert DC power to AC power with variable voltage magnitude and variable frequency. This thesis discusses the advantages and drawbacks of three different PWM techniques: the sinusoidalPWM(SPWM) technique, the third-harmonic-injection PWM(THIPWM) technique, and the space-vector PWM (SVPWM) technique. These three methods are compared by discussing their ease of implementation and by analyzing the output harmonic spectra of various output voltages (poles voltages, line-to-neutral voltages, and line-to-line voltages) and their total harmonic distortion (THD). The simulation results show that both the THIPWM and SVPWM techniques have lower total harmonic distortion than the SPWM technique. The THIPWM and SVPWM techniques in the under-modulation region can both increase the fundamental output voltage by 15. 5 % over the SPWM technique. Moreover, the SVPWM technique can increase the fundamental output by about 5 % in each of the overmodulation regions 1 and 2, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Microstrip patch antennas of a {{proposed}} type would be tunable over broad wavelength ranges. These antennas would be attractive {{for use in a}} variety of microwave communication systems in which there are requirements for transmission and/or reception at multiple, widely separated frequencies. Prior efforts to construct tunable microstrip patch antennas have involved integration of microstrip circuitry with, variously, ferrite films with magneticfield tuning, <b>solid-state</b> <b>electronic</b> tuning <b>devices,</b> or piezoelectric tuning actuators. Those efforts have been somewhat successful, but have yielded tuning ranges of 20 percent and smaller much smaller than needed in typical practical cases. Like prior microstrip patch antennas (both tunable and non-tunable), the proposed antennas would have instantaneous bandwidths of about 1 percent of their nominal or resonance frequencies. However, these would be tunable over much broader frequency ranges as much as several octaves, depending on specific designs. They could be fabricated relatively simply and inexpensively by use of conventional photolithography, and without need for integration with <b>solid-state</b> <b>electronic</b> or piezoelectric control devices.

40|$|Most <b>solid-state</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>devices</b> diodes, transistors, and {{integrated}} circuits {{are based on}} silicon. Although this material works well for many applications, its properties limit its ability to function under extreme high-temperature or high-power operating conditions. Silicon carbide (SiC), with its desirable physical properties, could someday replace silicon for these types of applications. A major roadblock to realizing this potential {{is the quality of}} SiC material that can currently be produced. Semiconductors require very uniform, high-quality material, and commercially available SiC tends to suffer from defects in the crystalline structure that have largely been eliminated in silicon. In some power circuits, these defects can focus energy into an extremely small area, leading to overheating that can damage the device. In an effort to better understand the way that these defects affect the electrical performance and reliability of an SiC device in a power circuit, the NASA Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field began an in-house three-dimensional computational modeling effort. The goal is to predict the temperature distributions within a SiC diode structure subjected to the various transient overvoltage breakdown stresses that occur in power management circuits. A commercial computational fluid dynamics computer program (FLUENT-Fluent, Inc., Lebanon, New Hampshire) was used to build a model of a defect-free SiC diode and generate a computational mesh. A typical breakdown power density was applied over 0. 5 msec in a heated layer at the junction between the p-type SiC and n-type SiC, and the temperature distribution throughout the diode was then calculated. The peak temperature extracted from the computational model agreed well (within 6 percent) with previous first-order calculations of the maximum expected temperature {{at the end of the}} breakdown pulse. This level of agreement is excellent for a model of this type and indicates that three-dimensional computational modeling can provide useful predictions for this class of problem. The model is now being extended to include the effects of crystal defects. The model will provide unique insights into how high the temperature rises in the vicinity of the defects in a diode at various power densities and pulse durations. This information also will help researchers in understanding and designing SiC devices for safe and reliable operation in high-power circuits...|$|R

The long T 1 =T 2 is due to quantum confinement effects, to the intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling of carbon, and to the protecting nature of the outer shells of the inner spins from the influences of environmental disturbances. Following the observation of spin polarization by electron spin resonance, we controlled the quantum state of the electron spin by applying short bursts of an oscillating magnetic field and observed coherent oscillations of the spin state.
