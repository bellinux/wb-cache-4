25|$|His first {{published}} papers, {{which appeared in}} 1842 and 1843, were on the steady motion of incompressible fluids and some cases of fluid motion. These were followed in 1845 by one on the friction of fluids in motion and the equilibrium and motion of elastic solids, and in 1850 by another {{on the effects of}} the internal friction of fluids on the motion of pendulums. To the theory of sound he made several contributions, including a discussion of the effect of wind on the intensity of sound and an explanation of how the intensity is influenced {{by the nature of the}} gas in which the sound is produced. These inquiries together put the science of fluid dynamics on a new footing, and provided a key not only to the explanation of many natural phenomena, such as the suspension of clouds in air, and the subsidence of ripples and waves in water, but also to the solution of practical problems, such as the flow of water in rivers and channels, and the <b>skin</b> <b>resistance</b> of ships.|$|E
2500|$|A study {{conducted}} by electrical engineer James Ruggieri and published December 2005 in the Journal of the National Academy of Forensic Engineers measured a Taser's output as 39 times more powerful than specified. The study concluded that the discharge is sufficient to trigger ventricular fibrillation, a 50 percent risk according to the IEC 479-1 series of electric safety standards. Ruggieri said that high rise-time pulses breaks down skin tissue, decreasing its resistance and increasing current through the body.

2500|$|Biofeedback is used {{to monitor}} a subject's mental relaxation. In some cases, {{biofeedback}} does not monitor electroencephalography (EEG), but instead bodily parameters such as electromyography (EMG), galvanic <b>skin</b> <b>resistance</b> (GSR), and heart rate variability (HRV). Many biofeedback systems are used to treat certain disorders such as {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD), sleep problems in children, teeth grinding, and chronic pain. EEG biofeedback systems typically monitor four different bands (theta: 4–7Hz, alpha:8–12Hz, SMR: 12–15Hz, beta: 15–18Hz) and challenge the subject to control them. Passive BCI involves using BCI to enrich human–machine interaction with implicit information on the actual user's state, for example, simulations to detect when users intend to push brakes during an emergency car stopping procedure. Game developers using passive BCIs need to acknowledge that through repetition of game levels the user's cognitive state will change or adapt. Within the first play ...|$|E

50|$|An electrodermograph (EDG) {{measures}} skin {{electrical activity}} directly (skin conductance and skin potential) and indirectly (<b>skin</b> <b>resistance)</b> using electrodes {{placed over the}} digits or hand and wrist. Orienting responses to unexpected stimuli, arousal and worry, and cognitive activity can increase eccrine sweat gland activity, increasing the conductivity of the skin for electric current. In skin conductance, an electrodermograph imposes an imperceptible current across the skin and measures how easily it travels through the skin. When anxiety raises the level of sweat in a sweat duct, conductance increases. Skin conductance is measured in microsiemens (millionths of a siemens). In skin potential, a therapist places an active electrode over an active site (e.g., the palmar surface of the hand) and a reference electrode over a relatively inactive site (e.g., forearm). Skin potential is the voltage that develops between eccrine sweat glands and internal tissues and is measured in millivolts (thousandths of a volt). In <b>skin</b> <b>resistance,</b> also called galvanic skin response (GSR), an electrodermograph imposes a current across the skin and measures the amount of opposition it encounters. <b>Skin</b> <b>resistance</b> is measured in kΩ (thousands of ohms).|$|E

40|$|Actual and {{simulated}} microgravity induces hypovolemia {{and cardiovascular}} deconditioning, associated with vascular dysfunction. We hypothesized that vasoconstriction of skin microcirculatory bed should be altered following 7 days of simulated microgravity {{in order to}} maintain cardiovascular homeostasis during active standing. Eight healthy men were studied before and after 7 days of simulated microgravity modeled by dry immersion (DI). Changes of plasma volume and orthostatic tolerance were evaluated. Calf skin blood flow (laser-Doppler flowmetry), ECG and blood pressure signal during a 10 -min stand test were recorded, and <b>skin</b> vascular <b>resistance,</b> central hemodynamics, baroreflex sensitivity and heart rate variability were estimated. After DI we observed increased calf <b>skin</b> vascular <b>resistance</b> in the standing position (12. 0 +/- 1. 0 AU-after- vs. 6. 8 +/- 1. 4 AU-before), while supine it was unchanged. Cardiovascular deconditioning was confirmed by greater tachycardia on standing and by hypovolemia (- 16 +/- 3 % at day 7 of DI). Total peripheral resistance and indices of cardiovascular autonomic control were not modified. In conclusion, unchanged autonomic control and total peripheral resistance suggest that increased skin vasoconstriction to standing involves rather local mechanisms-as venoarteriolar reflex-and might compensate insufficient vasoconstriction of other vascular beds...|$|R

40|$|We used {{simulations}} from a biophysical {{model that}} integrates interlinked exchanges {{of energy and}} water between frogs and their environments to address questions about the limits to thermoregulation and about adaptations for arboreality. Body size and cutaneous resistance (Rc) both significantly affected body temperature (Tb) and the time to desiccate to 70 % of standard mass (an ecologically relevant metric of desiccation). Cutaneous resistances < 25 s/cm allow basking frogs to elevate their Tb several degrees above ambient, but Rc above 25 had little additional effect on Tb. Small frogs (< 10 g) are able to elevate their Tb above ambient while basking, even with small Rc. Large frogs must have greater <b>skin</b> <b>resistances</b> {{to be able to}} elevate body temperatures above ambient, yet large frogs take longer to desiccate to 70 % of their standard mass.

The present study evaluates this hypothesis, by assessing in vitro the effect on skin permeation of applying diclofenac-dieythylamine 1. 16 % gel with or without rubbing. Methods A single dose of 5 [*]mg/cm 2 diclofenac-diethylamine 1. 16 % gel was applied on excised human skin mounted in Franz-type diffusion cells without or with rubbing for 45 [*]s. Drug penetration into the skin layers was determined after 1 [*]h using the tape stripping technique. In vitro cutaneous permeation into the receptor fluid of the diffusion chamber was measured up to 24 [*]h. <b>Skin</b> electrical <b>resistance</b> was also recorded. Results Application of diclofenac-diethylamine 1. 16 % gel with rubbing resulted to a 5 -fold higher flux of diclofenac through the skin than when applied without rubbing at 8 [*]h (P [*]=[*] 0. 04). Skin rubbing for 45 [*]s decreased by 2 -fold <b>skin</b> electrical <b>resistance</b> when compared to the standard application. Application of diclofenac-diethylamine 1. 16 % gel with rubbing tended to result in higher accumulation in the stripped skin vs. the superficial skin layers when applied without rubbing (P [*]=[*] 0. 2).
