40|$|Much of the {{economic}} literature on franchising has been concerned with incentive issues and how these are managed in <b>franchised</b> <b>contracts.</b> Two main types of incentive mechanisms have been identified: residual claims and self enforcement. In this paper we describe these incentive mechanisms, and their use in <b>franchise</b> <b>contracts.</b> We argue that although {{these two types of}} mechanisms are usually thought of as alternative ways to align franchisee and franchisor incentives, they are in fact complementary in <b>franchise</b> <b>contracts</b> because they address different incentive problems. We explore what these incentive problems are, and then describe specifically how <b>franchise</b> <b>contract</b> terms and practices support each type of incentive mechanism. Finally, we discuss briefly, via two examples, how our analysis also applies to non-franchised systems with common marks or other reputation concerns. ...|$|R

Our model of an endogenous franchising network underscores the trade‐off between the cost associated with specifying and enforcing the contractual terms and the cost associated with broadening the relationships with multiple franchisors. We show that when the contracting cost relative to the relational cost is high and when the economies of specialization is low, a non‐exclusive <b>franchise</b> <b>contract</b> is an optimal contractual arrangement to mitigate franchisor opportunism. ...|$|R
40|$|A <b>franchise</b> <b>contract</b> relocates {{distributable}} rent between franchisor and franchisee. With decentralized {{wage bargaining}} this modifies {{the position of}} the union in wage bargaining. If the rent is relocated to the franchisor completely, then even a strong union is not able to raise the wage above reservation level in the franchisee's firm. If franchisor and franchisee negotiate on rent division, there is an incentive to increase franchise fee with the consequence that franchisee's wage is pushed down. Therefore the overall rent assigned to labor depends on the differences of labor intensity in the franchisor's and franchisee's firm. Firm owners may be able to transfer distributable rents from a firm with a strong union to one with a weak union. Additional a <b>franchising</b> <b>contract</b> shows up a first mover advantage. The <b>franchising</b> <b>contract</b> is placed before wage bargaining, benefiting the franchisor.

40|$|Executive Summary: Balance {{of power}} {{is a factor in}} {{considerations}} of fairness in the formation of contracts and in Australia is an express factor in determining unconscionability in contract formation and performance. Certainty is essential to business confidence that underpins planning and investment. Certainty is also a factor in evaluating what parties have agreed to in making the contract. Discretion, if it is too wide, may no longer represent the true intentions of the parties, but may instead be an indication of other forces, including asymmetries in the power relationship. These issues are of particularly significance in franchising; redressing imbalance of power and ensuring certainty among the parties are among the stated goals of the regulation of the franchise sector in Australia. Previous analysis has demonstrated that the market interaction between franchisor and franchisee sets up a relationship that is characterized by imbalance of power and uncertainty for a franchisee. Further, it has been demonstrated that, in theory, the standard form and relational qualities of the <b>franchise</b> <b>contract</b> synergistically reinforce these conditions. This paper tests that theory by evaluating balance of power and uncertainty in the terms of <b>franchise</b> <b>contracts.</b> A sample of ten contractual terms from nineteen <b>franchise</b> <b>contracts</b> is analysed as follows: first, the purpose of each contract term is outlined and the interests of both a franchisor and a franchisee are explained with respect to each term; second, the results of the sample are discussed. The results show that contract terms indicate that greater power resides with a franchisor, while higher levels of uncertainty are experienced by franchisees. This section also discusses the allocation of discretion in <b>franchise</b> <b>contracts.</b> Discretion accorded to parties in contracting relationships can be both a measure of balance of power and certainty as well as a factor that reinforces these conditions. The results presented here also indicate that <b>franchise</b> <b>contracts</b> confer high levels of discretion upon a franchisor. Complacency about the ability of the sector to regulate itself through market and contractual mechanisms therefore should be guarded against. Note: A companion paper discusses direct intervention, with a particular focus on the potential for disclosure to function effectively as a principal means of regulating the sector.

The following reports examine how this case would be resolved in seven other European jurisdictions – Belgium, Estonia, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom, Italy and the Netherlands – as well as under the Draft Common Frame of Reference.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} UK <b>franchise</b> <b>contracts</b> {{over the}} period 1989 - 1999. Franchising is modelled as comprising three main variables, contract length, royalty rate and initial franchise fee. Up to now most authors have concentrated on the latter two variables, but with the data in this paper {{it is possible to}} assess the characteristics that impact on all three. Further, our analysis looks at what affects the probability of contract change. We take account of the limited dependent variable nature of the data and exploit sectoral heterogeneity. Our main findings are that the focus of attention on 'aggregate' variables is inappropriate and that contract length appears to be an important aspect of the <b>franchise</b> <b>contract</b> which is theoretically obvious, but until now has not been empirically tested.

We also explore the existence of interdependencies between the different elements of the system. and find some complementarities between completion and termination rights, and between monitoring rights and the intensity of incentives. <b>Franchising,</b> <b>contracts,</b> self-enforcement, incentives, complementarities, automobiles...|$|R
40|$|Franchise is a {{widespread}} business model in countries with developed economies. Although that in Albania there are few franchising relations, the Albanian Civil Code provides <b>franchising</b> as a <b>contract.</b> The <b>franchise</b> <b>contract</b> is a binding agreement where the franchiser grants the franchisee {{the right to use}} the trademark and the operating system of the franchiser, mutually fulfilling rights and duties derived by this contract. The most important duty of the franchiser is to make available to the franchisee a standardized set of immaterial rights, models, charts, profit, organization and trade ideas, and other appropriate knowledge for the development of trade. During the negotiations, the parties have to show each other the commercial affairs conditions dealing with the franchise agreement and the franchise obligations particular program. The information during the negotiations must be confidential and such must remain, even if the contract is not concluded. The Albanian Civil Code provides that in general during the contract negotiations, the parties must act in good faith towards each other.
