5|$|After {{completing}} his elementary {{education in the}} public schools, Johnson attended Vanderbilt Preparatory School for Boys, a Methodist institution in Elkton, Kentucky. He finished his preparatory coursework in 1914 and matriculated to Central Methodist College in Fayette, Missouri.

5|$|Based on <b>studies</b> <b>to</b> {{grow the}} Mercury {{spacecraft}} capabilities to long-duration flights, developing space rendezvous techniques, and precision Earth landing, Project Gemini was {{started as a}} two-man program in 1962 to overcome the Soviets' lead and to support the Apollo manned lunar landing program, adding extravehicular activity (EVA) and rendezvous and docking to its objectives. The first manned Gemini flight, Gemini 3, was flown by Gus Grissom and John Young on March 23, 1965. Nine missions followed in 1965 and 1966, demonstrating an endurance mission of nearly fourteen days, rendezvous, docking, and practical EVA, and gathering medical data {{on the effects of}} weightlessness on humans.|$|E

5|$|Biochemistry {{laboratories}} {{often use}} in vitro <b>studies</b> <b>to</b> explore ATP-dependent molecular processes. Enzyme inhibitors of ATP-dependent enzymes such as kinases {{are needed to}} examine the binding sites and transition states involved in ATP-dependent reactions. ATP analogs are also used in X-ray crystallography to determine a protein structure in complex with ATP, often together with other substrates.|$|E
5|$|Brin {{immigrated to}} the United States with his family from the Soviet Union {{at the age of}} 6. He earned his bachelor's degree at the University of Maryland, {{following}} in his father's and grandfather's footsteps by studying mathematics, as well as computer science. After graduation, he enrolled in Stanford University to acquire a PhD in computer science. There he met Page, with whom he later became friends. They crammed their dormitory room with inexpensive computers and applied Brin's data mining system to build a web search engine. The program became popular at Stanford, and they suspended their PhD <b>studies</b> <b>to</b> start up Google in a rented garage.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{interest}} in French authors, Mariano Moreno was not Francophile or afrancesado. He kept a strong Spanish cultural heritage, and both Levene and Abelardo Ramos agree in that his stay in Chuquisaca influenced him more than the books. In line with the Spanish Enlightenment, Moreno kept strong religious beliefs. He removed the chapter from Rousseau's work that is critical of religion, and never became a freemason. He gave up his religious <b>studies</b> <b>to</b> study law and get married, but never actually became a priest, {{so there was no}} defrocking. He studied with priests such as Terrazas, who approved and perhaps even encouraged the change of vocation.|$|E

5|$|Durio {{is often}} {{included}} in Bombacaceae {{because of the}} presence of monothecate anthers, as opposed to the bithecate anthers common to the rest of the mallows (and angiosperms, in general). However, the first <b>studies</b> <b>to</b> examine mallow phylogeny using molecular data found that the tribe Durioneae should actually be placed in the subfamily Helicteroideae of an expanded Malvaceae. The authors of these studies hypothesize that monothecate anthers have most likely evolved convergently in Durioneae and in the Malvatheca clade (comprising Malvaceae s.l. subfamilies Malvoideae and Bombacoideae).|$|E
5|$|Fielding {{started work}} on his fourth play, The Temple Beau, in April 1729, but did not finish {{until the end of}} the year. Rejected by his first theatre, the play had to be {{performed}} at another one, where it had 13 shows its first year and few revivals thereafter. The play is about Wilding, a young law student who gives up his <b>studies</b> <b>to</b> seek pleasure, and his attempts to marry a woman for her money. Fielding focuses on hypocrisy and gender equality in marriage with characters' interaction with Wilding.|$|E
5|$|Fraternity {{growth was}} {{interrupted}} by the Civil War, as men from many Southern colleges halted their <b>studies</b> <b>to</b> join the Confederate army. Many fraternity chapters ceased to exist during this time, but some students made efforts to preserve their fraternities as the war continued. Harry St. John Dixon, a member of Sigma Chi from the University of Virginia, joined with four other Sigma Chi brothers from other universities to form the Constantine Chapter of the fraternity. Created in 1864, this chapter was meant to preserve the bonds of the fraternity during the war, promote ties between the North and South, and ensure the fraternity's continued existence.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, {{acetylcysteine}} {{has been}} confirmed, {{in a recent}} double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted by the US military, to reduce the effects of blast induced mild traumatic brain and neurological injury in soldiers. Multiple animal studies have also demonstrated its efficacy in reducing the damage associated with moderate traumatic brain or spinal injury, and also ischemia-induced brain injury. In particular, it has been demonstrated through multiple <b>studies</b> <b>to</b> significantly reduce neuronal losses and to improve cognitive and neurological outcomes associated with these traumatic events. Acetylcysteine has been safely used to treat paracetamol overdose for over forty years and is extensively used in emergency medicine.|$|E
5|$|Genital herpes {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to diagnose than oral herpes, since most HSV-2-infected persons have no classical symptoms. Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including fungal infection, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, and urethritis. Laboratory testing is often used to confirm a diagnosis of genital herpes. Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) <b>studies</b> <b>to</b> detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.|$|E
5|$|Goldschmidt drew {{criticism}} {{in recent years}} for some of his business activities. In 2002, he lobbied business and political leaders to support Weyerhaeuser in its hostile takeover of Willamette Industries, Inc., then the only Fortune 500 company headquartered in Portland. In early 2004, he backed a purchase of Portland General Electric (PGE) by Texas Pacific Group which, though never consummated, put on hold city and county <b>studies</b> <b>to</b> acquire PGE by condemnation. Criticism of Goldschmidt's business activities peaked when, on November 13, 2003, Governor Ted Kulongoski nominated him to the Oregon State Board of Higher Education.|$|E
