5000|$|Late on {{the night}} of 29 August, the Prime Minister {{introduced}} an emergency bill entitled the [...] "Border Protection Bill 2001".

The bill was intended to enter into force at 9:00 Australian Eastern Standard Time, 29 August 2001 (s 2); thus making the bill retroactive. It also attempted to ensure actions taken prior to legislation passage to remove ship and return people to it would have been treated as legal.|$|R

40|$|The overall aim of {{this case}} study {{is to find the}} most {{cost-effective}} strategy for complying with the IMO s MARPOL Convention Regulation 13 & 14 in the Baltic Sea Emission Control Areas (ECAs) in the period from 2015 to 2035. The alternative compliance strategies considered are:- Scenario 0 : Use Marine Gas Oil (MGO with 0. 1 % sulphur) to comply with the sulphur requirements, no other abatement measures installed, but an assumed NOx-taxation applies;- Scenario 1 : Use Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO with 2. 7 % sulphur) and add scrubber and SCR to reduce SOx and NOx emissions, respectively;- Scenario 2 : Use Marine Gas Oil (MGO with 0. 1 % sulphur) together with an SCR; and- Scenario 3 : Use Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), single fuel or dual fuel. The following route is established: Helsinki Zeebrugge Antwerp St. Petersburg Kotka Helsinki. The total distance for the roundtrip is 3654 nm. 48 roundtrips are completed every year. Based on the specific fuel consumption for the engine and the sulphur content in the fuel, the sulphur emission factor for each scenario is calculated. The amount of SOx emitted from the ship is found by summarizing the product of the engine load, the engine size, the <b>ship</b> <b>s</b> estimated <b>time</b> at sea and the emission factor. The NOx emission limits for the ship engines in relation to their rated engine speed given in revolutions per minute. The NOx emission factor is assumed to be constant at 55 kg NOx per ton fuel. Investment analyses are performed for a ship type both as new builds and as retrofitted. Operational costs include: fuel costs, lubricating oil costs, maintenance and repair/replacement costs, environmental taxation and educational costs (where applicable), among others. Scenario 0 is chosen as reference point {{based on the fact that}} it has the lowest investment cost among the scenarios. The cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) relative Scenario 0 is found from the following formula:CER[EUR/tons]=(Differences in PVC between Scenario 0 and Scenario X) /(Differences in emissions between Scenario 0 and Scenario X) =&# 8710;PVC/&# 8710;EThe following conclusions are drawn from the cost-effectiveness analysis: - The scrubber in combination with SCR is a favored compliance strategy for IMO s requirements, both for new builds and retrofits. It has the lowest fuel costs (HFO prices are low and stable) and the lowest present value of total costs among the scenarios outlined. - Having an engine running on MGO is not considered cost-effective. MGO prices are high, and are expected to increase even more. NOx abatement technologies are needed in addition. - LNG is a cost-effective solution, and it is the most environmental friendly alternative. Retrofitting vessels to run on LNG, however, is expensive. The LNG dual fuel technology is a flexible solution, and makes it more economic for the ship to trade outside the ECAs. - The cost comparison between the different scenarios depends largely on the future development of fuel prices. - Modal shift to either rail or road could be a consequence...|$|R

40|$|How does {{government}} value people 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>time?</b> Often the valuation is implicit, even mysterious. But in {{patches of}} the federal administrative state, paperwork burdens are quantified in hours and often monetized. When agencies do monetize, they look to how the labor market values {{the time of the}} people faced with paperwork. The result is that some people 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>time</b> is valued over ten times more than other people 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>time.</b> In contrast, when agencies monetize the value of statistical life for cost-benefit analysis, they look to how people faced with a risk of death subjectively value its reduction. In practice, agencies assign the same value to every statistical life saved by a given policy. This Article establishes these patterns of agency behavior and suggests that there is no satisfying justification for them. Welfarist and egalitarian principles, along with the logic of statistical life valuation, lean against the use of market wages to monetize a person 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>time</b> doing government paperwork. The impact of this practice might be limited, given the modest ambition of today 2 ̆ 7 s paperwork reduction efforts. But time-related burdens—and benefits—are key consequences of government decisions in countless contexts. If we want to scale up a thoughtful process for valuing people 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>time</b> in the future, we will need new foundations...|$|R
