It focuses on the emotional and practical consequences of a death occurring in these settings. It outlines the bereavement needs of residents, relatives and staff as well as obstacles to providing adequate support. Homes differed in policies and practices in relation to providing bereavement support for relatives. Most managers felt some responsibility for relatives of deceased residents, but rarely felt capable of providing what they perceived as appropriate bereavement support. They recognized the need for practical as well as emotional support for staff and other residents after a death but felt that they lacked the skills and time to provide this. Certain types of home prioritized bereavement support, but many homes operated under considerable resource and <b>staffing</b> <b>constraints.</b> Even where support needs were recognized it was often difficult to put the requisite help into operation.

40|$|Introduction The {{increasing}} importance {{accorded the}} social and behavioural sciences in medical education presents opportunities for developing new and innovative forms {{of teaching and learning}} in this field. Yet social and behavioural scientists often feel isolated and marginalized. This research was designed to build a network of such practitioners to share and compare current practice, and to develop better models and resources. Methods Questionnaire survey and workshop discussions describe current practice among social and behavioural scientists in UK medical education, and identify current and future issues. Results Most UK medical curricula feature a significant social and behavioural science component, often in multidisciplinary contexts. Questions of core content, and how this relates to desired learning outcomes, particularly in the attitudinal sphere, remain unresolved. Identity problems result from differing perspectives of medics and social and behavioural scientists, <b>staffing</b> <b>constraints,</b> assessment regimes, and relationships with external examiners.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} for and progress of a gradual transition from a highly centralized model for cataloging to an iterative, collaborative, and broadly distributed model for electronic resource description. The author's purpose is to alert library managers to some experiments underway {{and to help them}} conceptualize new methods for defining, planning, and leading the e-resource description process under moderate to severe time and <b>staffing</b> <b>constraints.</b> To build a coherent library system for discovery and retrieval of networked resources, librarians and technologists are experimenting with team-based efforts and new workflows for metadata creation. In an emerging new service model for e-resource description, metadata can come from selectors, public service librarians, information technology staff, authors, vendors, publishers, and catalogers. Arguing that e-resource description demands a level of cross-functional collaboration and creative problem-solving that is often constrained by libraries' functional organizational structures, the author calls for reuniting functional groups into virtual teams that can integrate the e-resource description process, speed up operations, and provide better service. The paper includes an examination of the traditional division of labor for producing catalogs and bibliographies, a discussion of experiments that deploy a widely distributed e-resource description process (e. g., the use of CORC at Cornell and Brown), and an exploration of the results of a brief study of selected ARL libraries' e-resource discovery systems...|$|R

To {{examine the impact of}} recommendations made in October 2011 for improving the psychosocial and physical environments of the wards 1 year later. Background. There is an increasing policy recognition of the need for a better trained and educated dementia care workforce and of ensuring that the environmental design of care settings meets the needs of people with dementia. Design and methods. At both time points, three established and validated data collection methods evaluated (i) staff/patient interaction and patient experience, (ii) {{the extent to which the}} wards met dementia friendly principles and (iii) staff views about their work environment and their perceptions about their practice. Sixteen (five male and 11 female) patients with dementia and 69 staff in the two wards participated in the study. Results.

In 2013, in-depth {{interviews were conducted}} with 14 stakeholders across eight rural/regional organisations that had received state government funding to provide social participation initiatives for ethnic seniors. Within interviews, participants were asked to outline factors that had enhanced or hindered their capacity to deliver the funded projects, and their plans for sustainability. Data were analysed thematically in accordance with Shediac-Rizkallah and Bone's (1998) tripartite programme sustainability framework (project design and implementation, organisational setting and broader community environment). Findings indicate that in the context of resource and <b>staffing</b> <b>constraints</b> and a lack of ethnic critical mass, programme sustainability reflected the increased capacity of rural ethnic seniors to integrate into existing community groups and maintain their own groups and activities. However, this is dependent on the ability of mainstream government, health and social care services to cater for diverse cultural needs and preferences, the ability of rural organisations to support ethnic seniors to manage their own cultural groups and activities, and the capacity of funding bodies, rural community and policy structures to maintain cultural sensitivity while compensating for the rural premium. In addition to identifying some key learnings for rural governments, health and community organisations, this research highlights the precarious nature of rural programme sustainability for ethnic seniors in the context of wider community, organisational and policy constraints...|$|R

Manual testing, requires skill workers which increases cost; increases testing time which delays product delivery; reduces number of test cases which affects product quality, {{is not a}} desirable choice. The low cost PC based automated system helps to get an edge by fulfilling the today's organization requirement. The automated testing system described in this thesis is developed to support functional testing of all testing phases of Nortel's 1 -Meg Modem System (SUT). The SUT is an inherently complex ADSL product and its testing is far more complex than just verification of process faults. The complexity of ADSL system, renders automated test system an important and imperative part of ADSL testing. The requirement for an automated system has greatly increased due {{to the realization that}} manual testing is associated with additional resources and <b>staffing</b> <b>constraints,</b> which takes 15 to 90 minutes to run a single test on the SUT.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{projects}} have been implemented {{in the past in}} response to damage resulting from the floods to which Fiji is prone. These UNDP-financed projects included FIJ/ 80 / 07, (Hurricane Flood Rehabilitation), FIJ/ 84 / 004 (Assistance to Dredging and Drainage), and FIJ/ 86 / 001 (Watershed Management Study). Implementation of these projects led to the conclusion that an integrated river improvement master plan was needed to mitigate the flooding problem. As a result, the present project was set up to prepare such a plan for the Rewa river, a plan that could serve as an example for the other major rivers in Fiji. Using field surveys and data capture, combined with rainfall time series, a number of possible flood mitigation scenarios were examined by means of a mathematical computer simulation model. Application of cost-benefit analyses, combined with socio- economic parameters, let to the selection of a short-list of efficient flood-mitigation measures. These were ranked and are available to the Government for consideration. The techniques developed during the project have been passed on where possible to counterpart staff, and the basis now exists for extension of such planning to other catchments in Fiji. However, local <b>staff</b> <b>constraints</b> imply that in the near term, any future work would still require external technical assistance. Consequently, a follow-up project has been proposed.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Planning and Interpretation, 2009 Stormwater {{runoff from}} {{development}} degrades receiving water bodies and alters {{their capacity to}} support life. Environmental planners are tasked with managing impacts from human land uses on ecosystem functions {{in order to meet}} water quality goals. However, conventional stormwater management practices aggravate development impacts, raising the need for a paradigm shift in stormwater management. Low Impact Development (LID) approaches to stormwater management can minimize impacts from runoff, and protect water quality and stream ecosystems by mimicking pre-development hydrology. Barriers to adoption, needs, and opportunities for LID on the North Coast of California were assessed through a comparative analysis of the North Coast and four other regions in the United States currently implementing LID. The analysis was based on literature review and on interviews with stormwater professionals in the five regions. The most significant barriers to LID found on the North Coast were institutionalized conventional practices, budget and <b>staff</b> <b>constraints,</b> and challenging local site conditions. The most significant regional needs identified to promote a shift toward LID were economic incentives, education and research, and regulatory and policy reform. Growing ???regulatory-will??? from the state and local level, and significant existing human capital may provide opportunities to help spur LID uptake locally. Recommendations based on my study are that LID policy language be included in General Plans, codes, and ordinances. Standards and requirements for LID should be developed to be consistent on a regional scale. Additionally, local governments should take greater advantage of partnerships with local watershed groups, and universities to create LID educational opportunities...|$|R
40|$|Requirements {{verification}} {{is typically}} the costliest {{part of the}} systems engineering design process. In the commercial aircraft industry, as the software and hardware design evolves, it must be verified to conform to requirements. In addition, when new design releases are made, regression analysis must be performed which usually requires repeat testing. To streamline verification, a suite of automated verification tools is described in this document which can reduce the test effort. This test suite can be qualified {{to be used to}} verify systems at any DO- 178 B design assurance level. Some of the software tools are briefly described below. There are major advantages of this automated verification effort. The tools can either be internally developed by a company or purchased 2 ̆ 2 off the shelf 2 ̆ 2, depending upon budget and <b>staff</b> <b>constraints.</b> Every automated test case can be run with the click of a button and failures caused by human factors are reduced.

The expansion of these test programs would enable the creation of a universal avionics test suite with minimal cost and a reduction of the overall program verification effort. The following is a presentation of an automated test station capable of reducing verification time and cost. The hardware and software aspects needed to create the test station are examined.
