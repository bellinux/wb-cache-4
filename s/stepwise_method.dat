The direct method involves estimating the discriminant function {{so that all the}} predictors are assessed simultaneously. The <b>stepwise</b> <b>method</b> enters the predictors sequentially. The two-group method should be used when the dependent variable has two categories or states. The multiple discriminant method is used when the dependent variable has three or more categorical states. Use Wilks’s Lambda to test for significance in SPSS or F stat in SAS. The most common method used to test validity is to split the sample into an estimation or analysis sample, and a validation or holdout sample. The estimation sample is used in constructing the discriminant function. The validation sample is used to construct a classification matrix which contains the number of correctly classified and incorrectly classified cases. The percentage of correctly classified cases is called the hit ratio.|$|E

40|$|The serious {{problems}} {{associated with the use of}} <b>stepwise</b> <b>methods</b> are well documented. Various authors have leveled scathing criticisms against the use of stepwise techniques, yet it is not uncommon to find these methods continually employed in educational and psychological research. The three main problems with stepwise techniques are: (1) computer packages use the wrong degree of freedom in their computations, producing spuriously statistically significant results; (2) <b>stepwise</b> <b>methods</b> capitalize outrageously on sampling error and therefore yield nonreplicable results; and (3) they do not identify the best set of predictors. As the literature already contains several examples of the misuse of <b>stepwise</b> <b>methods</b> in the case of regression, the present paper explains the {{problems associated with}} their use in the context of discriminant function analysis. It is suggested that these methods are equally as bad in multivariate statistics as they are in a univariate context and therefore should be avoided entirely.

40|$|In applied {{statistical}} studies, it {{is common}} to collect data on a large pool of candidate variables from which a small subset will be selected for further analysis. The practice of variable selection often combines the use of substantive knowledge with subjective judgment and data-based selection procedures. The most popular of such procedures are <b>stepwise</b> <b>methods.</b> However, <b>stepwise</b> selection <b>methods</b> have two fundamental shortcomings: a) Most theoretical results from classical statistics require the assumption that the set of variables to be analyzed was chosen independently of the data. Therefore, when the variables are selected based on the data, the results from classical distribution theory almost never hold. b) <b>Stepwise</b> selection <b>methods</b> look at one variable at a time and tend to ignore the impact of combining particular sets of variables together. Thus, as each variable “importance” is often influenced by the set variables currently under analysis, <b>stepwise</b> <b>methods</b> may fail to identify the most adequate variable subsets. The problems created by a) and b) are now widely recognized and have been discussed by several authors. Miller (1984, 1990) and Derksen and Keselman (1992) give good reviews of the relevant literature in the context of Regression Analysis. In the context of Discriminant Analysis the problems created by a) are discussed, among others, by Murray (1977), McKay and Campbel (1982 a), Snapinn and Knoke (1989) and Turlot (1990), and the problems created by b) are discussed by Hand (1981), McKay and Campbel (1982 a, 1982 b) an...|$|R

40|$|<b>Stepwise</b> <b>methods</b> for {{variable}} selection are frequently {{used to determine}} the predictors of an outcome in generalized linear models. Although it is widely used within the scientific community, {{it is well known that}} the tests on the explained deviance of the selected model are biased. This arises from the fact that the traditional test statistics upon which these methods are based were intended for testing pre-specified hypotheses; instead, the tested model is selected through a data-driven procedure. A multiplicity problem therefore arises. In this work, we define and discuss a nonparametric procedure to adjust the p-value of the selected model of any <b>stepwise</b> selection <b>method.</b> The unbiasedness and consistency of the method is also proved.

5000|$|An {{alternative}} is to use traditional <b>Stepwise</b> regression <b>methods</b> for model selection. This is also the default method when smoothing parameters are not estimated as part of fitting, in which case each smooth term is usually allowed {{to take one of}} a small set of pre-defined smoothness levels within the model, and these are selected between in a <b>stepwise</b> fashion. <b>Stepwise</b> <b>methods</b> operate by iteratively comparing models with or without particular model terms (or possibly with different levels of term complexity), and require measures of model fit or term significance in order to decide which model to select at each stage. For example, we might use p-values for testing each term for equality to zero to decide on candidate terms for removal from a model, and we might compare Akaike information criterion (AIC) values for alternative models.|$|R
40|$|Researchers with a {{multiple}} regression at hand, frequently wonder {{if all the}} independent variables are necessary. Suppose {{a multiple}} regression with k variables fits the data quite well. The question is: "Would a regression with, say, p variables (p < k) fit just as well? " <b>Stepwise</b> <b>methods</b> have traditionally been used to answer this question, primarily because of computing limitations. Weisberg (1980, page 195) states that: "Unfortunately, there are important drawbacks {{to the use of}} stepwise procedures. Firstly, [...] . the model chosen by stepwise regression need not be the best of any criterion of interest; indeed, {{because of the nature of}} the one-at-a-time philosophy of <b>stepwise</b> <b>methods,</b> there is no guarantee that the model chosen will in fact include any of the variables that would be in the best subset. <b>Stepwise</b> <b>methods</b> are best when the independent variables are nearly uncorrelated, the condition under which finding a subset model is least likely to be relevant. Also, it is possible to construct examples in which the best subset of size p = 2 is completely disjoint from the best subset for p = 3, and so on. Probably the worst indictment of stepwise techniques, at least for the user who is not statistically sophisticated, is that they produce a single result that appears to be the model. Similarly, many users pay undue attention to the order in which the variables are entered or deleted from a model [...] . The ordering of the variables that we get from stepwise regression is an artifact of the algorithm used and need not reflect relationships of substantive interest. " Why not fit all possible subsets? Many computing packages do this quite readily now. Computing limitations are not the problem anymore. SAS, for instance, will fit all subsets, or, selected "best " subsets if there are many independent variables. Suppose that Y is the dependent variable with X 1, X 2, [...] ., Xk, as independent variables. i) The older versions of SAS (i. e. those before Version 6) would use the following code: PROC RSQUARE CORR...|$|R
