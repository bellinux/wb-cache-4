Aside from {{the first couple of}} {{kilometres}} north of the Rideau River, the majority of the freeway cuts through <b>swaths</b> <b>of</b> farmland which fill the Ottawa Valley. The median also becomes narrower. The freeway encounters an interchange with Dilworth Road and thereafter with Roger Stevens Drive, the latter providing access to North Gower.|$|E
5|$|On the {{day before}} Reagan's 1987 visit, 50,000 people had {{demonstrated}} against {{the presence of the}} American president in Berlin. During the visit itself, wide <b>swaths</b> <b>of</b> Berlin were closed off to prevent further anti-Reagan protests. The district of Kreuzberg, in particular, was targeted in this respect, with movement throughout this portion of the city in effect restrained completely (for instance the subway line 1 was shut down).|$|E

5|$|While Stratton was at Johns Hopkins, the San Francisco Earthquake of 1906 struck {{destroying}} large <b>swaths</b> <b>of</b> the city. He had specific {{suggestions on}} how to rebuild the city to resist earthquakes and fires even with the water supply cut off. He urged the city be split into districts with avenues or boulevauds as firebreaks between the divisions.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on water supplies originating outside its borders, making it highly vulnerable to changes in water supply due to climate change. Droughts are frequent and devastating. Several years of droughts {{during the last decade}} have severely affected agricultural production and reduced economic growth. A drought in 2009 was the worst drought in more than 50 years. Many cattle died of hunger, and huge <b>swaths</b> <b>of</b> soy, corn and wheat fields were affected. It was estimated that the country lost more than US$5billion from the drought. A drought in 2011 affected farming of soy and corn, causing losses of US$2.5billion.|$|E
5|$|Deserts are {{increasingly}} seen as sources for solar energy, {{partly due to}} low amounts of cloud cover. Many successful solar power plants have {{been built in the}} Mojave Desert. These plants have a combined capacity of 354 megawatts (MW) making them the largest solar power installation in the world. Large <b>swaths</b> <b>of</b> this desert are covered in mirrors, including nine fields of solar collectors. The Mojave Solar Park is currently under construction and will produce 280MW when completed.|$|E

5|$|In 1872 or 1873, Yount {{was hired}} as a {{seasonal}} guide, wrangler and packer for geological survey expeditions with the aim of mapping broad <b>swaths</b> <b>of</b> the Rocky Mountains. The Hayden Survey, led by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden and funded by the Department of the Interior, was one of several regional survey projects that were combined to form the United States Geological Survey in 1879. Hayden {{had been one of the}} leading advocates for the creation of Yellowstone National Park, which President Ulysses S. Grant signed into law on March 1, 1872.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the hurricane, the road {{networks}} of the affected countries remained severely disrupted for extended periods of time, hampering relief efforts in badly flooded regions. Government and emergency officials opened shelters and distributed food for the thousands that had lost their homes or sources of income. Throughout Central America and Mexico, 116people lost their lives and 16 others went missing. The disaster left <b>swaths</b> <b>of</b> private property, infrastructure, and farmland in complete ruins, leading to damage costs of more than $170million (1993USD).|$|E
5|$|Mary {{caused a}} {{significant}} amount of damage in Hong Kong and China. It was considered the worst storm to hit Hong Kong since the typhoon in 1937. The storm destroyed weak shacks made by refugees from the mainland, leaving thousands homeless. There were multiple landslides, and most of the infrastructure were damaged. More than 400 small watercraft were either damaged or destroyed. In China, dikes and dams were damaged severely, multiple public buildings collapsed, and destroyed large <b>swaths</b> <b>of</b> farmland. Significant wind and rain was also reported in Taiwan. More than 1,600 people died during the storm.|$|E

5|$|Redevelopment is {{underway}} {{for some of}} the abandoned industrial facilities, with the abandoned Oliver Corporation buildings being the most recent example of reclaimed property. The city also faced programs with large <b>swaths</b> <b>of</b> vacant housing after the decline of the manufacturing industry. In 2013, 1,347 homes were vacant or abandoned. However, the city created the Vacant and Abandoned Properties Initiative in February 2013, which aimed to take care of 1,000 vacant or abandoned homes in 1,000 days, either through demolition, repairing, or some other satisfactory means. As of June 2015, 828 homes have been demolished, repaired, or handed off to partners.|$|E
5|$|The British {{seized the}} {{opportunity}} to force Baji Rao into a treaty. The treaty (The Treaty of Pune) was signed on 13 June 1817. Key terms imposed on the Peshwa included the admission of Dengle's guilt, renouncing claims on Gaekwad, and surrender of significant <b>swaths</b> <b>of</b> territory to the British. These included his most important strongholds in the Deccan, the seaboard of Konkan, and all places north of the Narmada and south of the Tungabhadra rivers. The Peshwa was also not to communicate with any other powers in India. The British Resident Mountstuart Elphinstone also asked the Peshwa to disband his cavalry.|$|E
5|$|After Chennai {{district}}, Cuddalore {{district was}} among those most severely affected by the flooding. Six of the district's 13 blocks suffered extensive damage during the floods in November. The resumption of heavy rainfall from 1 December again inundated the Cuddalore municipality and the district, displacing {{tens of thousands of}} people. Rains continued through 9 December. Despite the state government and individuals sending rescue teams and tonnes of relief materials to the district, thousands of those affected continued to lack basic supplies due to inadequate distribution efforts; this resulted in several relief lorries being stopped and looted by survivors. Large <b>swaths</b> <b>of</b> Cuddalore city and the district remained inundated as of 10 December, with thousands of residents marooned by floodwaters and over 60,000 hectares of farmland inundated; over 30,000 people had been evacuated to relief camps.|$|E

5|$|Destruction was {{heaviest}} in Belize and totaled $250million (2001USD). Because Iris was compact, {{the damage}} was largely confined to 72% of the houses in the Toledo district and 50% of the houses in the Stann Creek district. The hurricane damaged or destroyed 3,718homes nationwide, and wrecked more than 95% of the homes in 35villages in the poorest parts of the country. Iris left about 15,000people homeless, many receiving assistance {{from the government and}} the local Red Cross chapter. High winds also damaged large <b>swaths</b> <b>of</b> forest and crops, mostly affecting the banana industry. Iris killed 24people in Belize, including 20 who died when a scuba diving boat capsized near Big Creek. The storm also killed eight people and damaged about 2,500homes in neighboring Guatemala, and later dropped heavy rainfall in southern Mexico, where two people died.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle-Atlantic states, {{it caused}} little injury overall, though many boats and ships were capsized. To {{the north in}} New England, many churches endured {{significant}} damage, and shipwrecks led to 15deaths, with one other death owing to a building collapse. Due to intense gusts, hundreds of trees were uprooted and many buildings were unroofed. Agriculture, shipping, timber, and livestock industries also suffered substantial impairment, with considerable injury experienced by barns, crops, watercraft, timber, and livestock. Farther north, entire <b>swaths</b> <b>of</b> forest were leveled, and heavy snow blocked roads, paths, and turnpikes. Fruit orchards and sugar groves endured {{the worst of the}} storm, reducing the season's harvests. Private properties generally suffered damage to roofs, windows, and chimneys; several buildings throughout the region were reported to have collapsed. Overall, approximately $100,000 in damage and more than 16deaths were recorded.|$|E
5|$|The Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912 and the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913 {{significantly}} increased tensions in Europe, which saw the dismemberment of large <b>swaths</b> <b>of</b> the Ottoman Empire. These conflicts provided the background {{for a major}} naval expansion program in Austria-Hungary, which received broad support in the Austrian and Hungarian parliaments. Admiral Anton Haus, then the Marinekommandant (Navy Commander) used the growing risk of war with Austria-Hungary's nominal ally, Italy, to push his construction program. As part of its construction program, the navy projected to build three cruisers, and adopted a secret construction schedule on 12 January 1914, which called for the first vessel to be laid down on 1 July 1914, followed by the other two on 1 July 1915. The first ship was projected {{to be completed by}} 31 December 1917, with the second and third following on 31 December 1918.|$|E

5|$|The rainbands of Billie brought severe {{flooding}} to the Philippines and Japan {{even while}} the typhoon's center was well removed from those locations. In the Philippines, one person was killed, and the flood damage totaled US$500,000. Floods were particularly destructive in Japan, where they destroyed 603homes in the western portion of the country. <b>Swaths</b> <b>of</b> crops were inundated by the floodwaters, and 44people were killed. Extensive flooding occurred in Taiwan and China, and seven deaths occurred in the former. In Busan, South Korea, Billie's effects forced the evacuation {{of thousands of people}} through tight corridors from a stadium, causing the indirect deaths of 61people.|$|E
5|$|Ecological {{damage was}} {{widespread}} but generally mild. Although damage to mangroves was minor, the cyclone defoliated <b>swaths</b> <b>of</b> many coastal and island forests. For the most part, cays and reefs were unharmed, with no visible {{change in the}} general appearance or shape of reefs and little underwater change as well. It was noted, however, that water clarity surrounding certain reefs was poor. River plumes of the Herbert, Tully, Murray, Hull, Johnstone, and Mulgrave/Russell rivers were noticeably changed, with some paths diverted. The Herbert River plume expanded to encompass areas near the Greater Palm group of islands, the Mulgrave/Russell around the Frankland Islands. In addition, {{the loss of a}} raft system utilized for farming of giant clams was noted near Fitzroy Island. Tourist operations experienced little damage from Winifred, with only minimal damage on Dunk Island, Bedarra Island, and Mission Beach. Overall, Winifred caused three deaths and $130million (1986AUD) in damage, and was described by the Bureau of Meteorology as the worst cyclone to strike Queensland since Cyclone Althea in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Flooding and {{landslides}} in Jamaica {{took their}} toll on property, agricultural interests, and infrastructure; fruit growers on the island sustained about $2.5 million (1935 USD) in losses. Just off the coast, an unidentified vessel went down with her entire crew in the hostile conditions. Strong winds buffeted coastal sections of Cuba, notably in and around Santiago de Cuba. There, the hurricane demolished 100 homes and filled streets with debris. Only four {{people died in the}} country, thanks to the extensive pre-storm preparations. The storm did the most damage along the Tiburon Peninsula of southwestern Haiti, where catastrophic river flooding took the lives of up to 2,000 individuals, razed hundreds of native houses, and destroyed crops and livestock. The heaviest destruction took place around the towns of Jacmel and Jérémie; one early report estimated that 1,500 had been killed at the latter. Entire <b>swaths</b> <b>of</b> countryside were isolated for days, delaying both reconnaissance and relief efforts.|$|E
