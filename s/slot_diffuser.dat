Therefore, a HVAC system is usually necessary. This paper above all emphasizes the integration of Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes. This coupled numerical approach can provide accurate information about both the HVAC system energy request and the indoor microclimatic control (temporal and spatial distribution of the parameters). Then, a case study concerning a typical museum exhibition room is examined. The annual energy request for three types of all-air system, {{as well as the}} temporal variation of indoor temperature and relative humidity, is evaluated by means of a BEPS code. Energy savings can be obtained using a system with desiccant wheel (11 %) or enthalpy wheel (9 %), compared to the base system. As regards indoor relative humidity control, this is more critical for summer conditions, and the best performance is obtained by the system with desiccant wheel.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the dissertation is to characterize the air distribution of a combined downward jet and to obtain {{a model of the}} velocity distribution. The objective is achieved through analyzing the initial outlet conditions of the diffusers, the velocity decay from the two flows, measuring the deflection of flow and finally modelling the dimensionless velocity profile of the flow using the excess velocity method on the co-flow. The combined downward jet is a possible improvement of the protected occupied zone ventilation, which aim to lower the exposure of contaminants to the occupant. Urbanization and stricter regulation on energy use of ventilation systems increase the risk of indoor exposure to pollutants and airborne pathogens. Ventilation systems that address the problem are needed. A combined downward jet is formed by introducing a plane jet from a <b>slot</b> <b>diffuser</b> and a co-flow from a perforated plate diffuser. Anemometers and a smoke machine is used to measure and analyze the flow. The combined downward jet deflects away from the co-flow and the deflection angle increase with higher co-flow velocity, while the velocity decay decrease. The expansion rate of the velocity profile, measured at y 1 / 2, increase up to 2. 5 times that of a plane jet without co-flow. There is likely the plane jet steal momentum from the co-flow, and the rate increase with the co-flow velocity. The excess velocity method show promise in creating a model for the combined downward jet, however with unanswered potential limitations. Future work need to analyze the interaction the plane jet has on the co-flow, and the co-flow needs accurate models for its velocity decay...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of the attached plane jet {{has proved to be}} an effective way to resolve the draught problem and to create a comfortable indoor environment. The objective of this thesis is to give a basis for improving the existing modelling and calculation method applied to predict the jet velocity in both ventilated and air-conditioned rooms using attached plane jet diffusers to avoid the draught problem. A special consideration is to set up models {{that could be used to}} predict the jet velocity along the surface more easily, more accurately and more efficiently than the existing methods under attachment and separation conditions. Jet velocity modelling and full-scale experimental measurement have been done to complete the above objectives. Through two measurement phases the whole flow field of the attached plane jet has been investigated experimentally in two full-scale test chambers. A large amount of data on jet velocity, temperature and turbulence intensity has been obtained; beyond that the visualization results are complementary to the understanding of turbulent buoyant jet characteristics. The results showed that: the superimposing model and the free convection velocity are capable of predicting the maximum air jet velocities along the wall under the conditions of the straight downward jet flow and the corner effect jet flow, respectively; the calculated corner-jet velocity profiles by the corner model obtained a good agreement with the measured results; the maximum velocity calculated by the model for the transition zone can be used to predict the maximum velocity decay. This work reveals that the turbulent attached plane jet behaves in a different way compared with the high Reynolds number turbulent jet in a ventilated and air-conditioned room. From the modelling viewpoint, the jet velocity models constructed here can be used to predict the maximum jet velocity decay and velocity profiles from the corner effect region in the indoor airflow studies. The detailed jet information obtained can contribute to the corresponding CFD simulation for further linear <b>slot</b> <b>diffuser</b> development...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{consumption}} in building sector {{has led to}} a great need for energy saving and energy efficient solutions for buildings. Next generation of buildings should apply high energy performance solutions in order to decrease the energy consumption. The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) requires {{that by the end of}} 2020 all new buildings should be nearly Zero Energy Buildings (nZEB). Therefore the tremendous efforts and emphasis have been put on development of new feasible solutions. Reducing the energy needs in nZEBs may lead to simplification of space heating system. With a long tradition and environmental friendly aspects, using wood stoves encourage their integration in nZEB. Recent investigation assume the one wood stove may ensure thermal comfort in the whole dwelling if the internal doors are open. However, it still remains unclear due to lack of understanding of some fundamental aspects, including heat transfer within or between different zones, temperature stratification inside zones, accumulation of particles in a certain zone in the building. The goal of this project work is to characterize the airflow distribution in a room with an air curtain and an additional heating equipment. Experimental measurements were performed in a full-scale climate chamber at NTNU Norwegian University of Science and Technology. The results of the experimental measurements are presented in this thesis to show the temperature and velocity distribution in the room, which contains two zones with temperature differences. This thesis assume better heat distribution through optimum passive and active methods. Therefore the effect of distributing the warm air through the <b>slot</b> <b>diffuser</b> generating downward plane jet has been investigated. The diffuser was installed above the doorway between warm and cold zones. Different discharged velocities from the diffuser were used during experiment. Additionally the influence of different heat source type and different heat source locations were investigated. The results showed that installing of the air curtain system between zones may decrease vertical temperature stratification and increase rapid of heat distribution between zones. Discharged velocities directly affect the performance of the airflow distribution between zones. Supplying the warm air through the air curtain system installed above the doorway may lead to reduction of the vertical temperature stratification inside both zones of the doorway. In addition, the investigation showed that the type of the heat source seems to not have a significant impact on the airflow distribution while using the air curtain system...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on {{findings}} resulting from ASHRAE Research Project RP- 1416. Convection at interior surfaces significantly affects the overall heat transfer in office buildings with large glazing areas. While {{a large number of}} these office buildings utilize ceiling slot dif-fusers at the glazed building perimeter, convection correlations specific to these diffusers have not yet been investigated. This paper describes convection correlations developed for ceiling <b>slot</b> <b>diffusers</b> and examines the effect of temperature, window geometry, and diffuser jet momen-tum on these correlations. The paper also examines the effect of venetian blinds on the overall correlations. The convective heat transfer coefficients are measured in both heating and cooling conditions. Overall, this paper represents the outcome of over 100 individual full-scale experi-ments. The results show that forced convection is dominant {{for a wide range of}} airflow rates. Correlations are developed as a function of the specific volumetric flow rate of supply air. The temperature of the supply air is also utilized as the reference temperature in convection calcula-tions. The correlations are found to rely primarily on window position and the presence of blinds. The correlations are independent of the temperature difference between surface and sup-ply, diffuser position, and diffuser jet momentum. The paper also quantifies the difference between the convection correlations developed for heated and cooled environments. Finally, uti-lizing energy modeling to quantify the difference between the new correlations and those previ-ously used, it is found that former convection coefficients underestimate the energy demand. In the modeled building, utilizing the newly developed correlations for forced convection increased the peak cooling load by 24 % and the overall energy consumption by 4 % over the baseline that had natural convection with constant coefficients at window surfaces...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of designing short curved wall axially symmetrical subsonic diffusers utilizing suction through <b>slots</b> in the <b>diffuser</b> walls to prevent flow separation was investigated. A potential flow analysis was made, and a digital computer program {{was written for}} determining the diffuser wall contour for prescribed boundary conditions.

One bell shaped diffuser and three annular diffusers with area ratios of either 2. 5 : 1 or 3 : 1 were designed, fabricated, and tested. Minimum suction requirements of metastable operation ranged from 6. 3 percent to 12 percent when operating with inlet air velocities in the 1000 to 250 ft/sec (30 to 76 m/sec) range. For stable operation suction rates from 10 percent to 22 percent were required. In all cases the diffuser effectiveness was above 95 percent based on the conventional definition, and from 81 percent to 94 percent when the suction loss was accounted for.

40|$|Thermal comfort, which depends {{mainly on}} {{temperature}} and airflow velocity distributions, {{is an important}} factor to consider when designing modern building energy systems. Up until today, the transient behavior of air flow structures has only been marginally investigated. The goal of this work is to study these structures in more detail, particularly the phenomena linked to the occurrence of free and forced convection. To this purpose an experimental test facility was built to provide new data about the transient behavior of large-scale flow structures in ventilated rooms. The test facility, called the Aachen model room, is 3 ~m high, 4 ~m wide and 5 ~m long. Four heat sources stretching over the whole length on the room are located inside. Each heat source is 5 ~m long, 0. 4 ~m wide and 0. 6 ~m high. The total internal load in the test facility can be varied between 0 ~kW and 6 ~kW by using adjustable power supply units. The room facing side of the walls is covered in aluminium foil. The effect of radiation can thus be neglected. Directly below the ceiling, on both sides, <b>slot</b> <b>diffusers</b> are installed over the whole length of the room. Each of the air inlets is one meter long and 20 ~mm high. The supply air can be brought inside either on both or just one side of the test facility. Exhaust air openings are located on floor level on both sides, over the whole length of the room, with the possibility of using just the openings at the back half of the room. The air flow velocity in the room is measured with twelve omnidirectional anemometers in a rectangular grid. The sensors measure the speed of the local velocity vector. The air temperature is measured with twelve platinum resistance thermometers. Each of the twelve temperature and velocity sensors is arranged on a horizontal aluminium profile at a distance of 0. 33 m from each other. The aluminium profile is fixed onto a traversing device. At isothermal boundary conditions {{and in the case of}} mixed convections with dominating forced convection the air flow structure is almost two-dimensional and stable over the whole length of the test facility. If the supply air is brought inside through both inlets two large and stable eddies occur. If the supply air is brought inside the model room on one side only one large and stable eddy is formed. The air flow structure is nearly two-dimensional over the length of the model room. If neither the free convection nor the forced convection dominates, an unstable room air flow structure occurs. The flow structure in the upper part of the model room is dominated by the forced convection from the supply air. The part directly above the heating sources is dominated by free convection. The whole room air flow structure is thus three-dimensional. The turbulence models applied in air flow simulations are based on the assumption of fully turbulent flows. However, it cannot be ruled out that there are areas within an air flow structure in a room which depend on the Reynolds number at the supply air inlet. This experimental setup was also used to provide information on such areas with low air velocities. The minimal supply air velocity required for the assumption that the room air flow structure is independent of the supply air velocity depends on the supply air inlet and the supply air momentum flow. In this study a connection between these factors was observed for the given geometries. The effect of the boundary conditions on the room air flow structure was studied by applying different supply air velocities and different internal loads. Low velocities and high internals loads lead to an unstable room air flow structure. By increasing the supply air velocity, the structure becomes more stable and can be considered two-dimensional over the whole length of the model room. The point where an unstable air flow structure becomes stable is observed at the same Archimedes number for different inlet velocities and internal loads, as long as the supply air and the heating loads are activated over the whole length of the test facility. In the case of a stable room air flow structure, the position of the exhaust opening has no further influence on the structure. Room air flow structures where no domination of forced convection is present do show an influence of the position of the exhaust opening. The room air flow structures are changing by varying the position of the exhaust opening. If only the opening at the back of the room are used, the two previously discussed stable eddies occur only in the back part of the model room, whereas the front part is characterised by a disordered flow structure...|$|R
40|$|The Vortec 7 is {{the first}} {{full-scale}} diffuser- augmented wind turbine (DAWT) to be built. A DAWT has a duct which surrounds the wind turbine blades and increases in cross-sectional area farther downstream. The aerodynamics of a diffuser are such that more air flows through the blade plane, and more power can be generated compared to a “bare turbine ” of the same rotor blade diameter. Research on using a diffuser to augment {{the power of a}} wind turbine had been directed by K. M. Foreman at Grumman Aerospace Corporation, and the design of the Vortec 7 is based on the best model as determined by wind tunnel tests on various DAWT options performed by Grumman in the 1970 s and early 1980 s. It was found that a simplified theoretical analysis showed significant differences from computational fluid dynamic (CFD) results, but that the CFD agreed quite well with field measurements. Many of the field results also agreed with the Grumman measurements, including wind speed-up at inlet near the blade tips. Preliminary measurements showed that the speed-up across the blade plane was not uniform as assumed by Foreman, decreasing towards the hub, and hence the power output of a DAWT would be less than predicted by Foreman. Improvements to the inlet velocity profile were anticipated after retrofitting a bullnose to the primary <b>diffuser</b> <b>slot</b> and a parabolic nose cone ahead of the rotor hub.

40|$|A {{submerged}} multiport diffuser is {{an effective}} device for disposal of water containing heat or other degradable wastes into a natural body of water. A high degree of dilution can be obtained and {{the environmental impact of}} concentrated waste can be constrained to a small area. An analytical and experimental investigation is conducted for the purpose of developing predictive methods for buoyant discharges from submerged multiport diffusers. The following physical situation is considered: A multiport diffuser with given length, nozzle spacing and vertical angle of nozzles is located on the bottom of a large body of water of uniform depth. The ambient water is unstratified and may be stagnant or have a uniform current which runs at an arbitrary angle to the axis of the diffuser. The general case of a diffuser in arbitrary depth of water and arbitrary buoyancy is treated. However, emphasis is put on the diffuser in shallow receiving water with low buoyancy, the type used for discharge of condenser cooling water from thermal power plants. A multiport diffuser will produce a general three-dimensional flow field. Yet the predominantly two-dimensional flow which is postulated to exist in the center portion of the three-dimensional diffuser cart be analyzed as a two-dimensional "channel model", that is a diffuser section bounded by walls of finite length and openings at both ends into a large reservoir. Matching of the solutions for the four distinct flow regions which can be discerned in the channel model, namely, a buoyant jet region, a surface impingement region, an internal hydraulic jump region and a stratified counterflow region, yields these results: The near-field zone is stable only for a limited range of jet densimetric Froude numbers and relative depths. The stability is also dependent on the jet discharge angle. It is only in this limited range that previous buoyant jet models assuming an unbounded receiving water are applicable to predict dilutions. Outside of the parameter range which yields stable near-field conditions, the diffuser-induced dilutions are essentially determined by the interplay of two factors: frictional effects in the far-field and the horizontal momentum input of the jet discharge. Three far-field flow configurations are possible, a counter flow system, a stagnant wedge system and a vertically fully mixed flow, which is the extreme case of surface and bottom interaction. A three-dimensional model for the diffuser-induced flow field is developed. Based on equivalency of far-field effects, the predictions of the two-dimensional channel model can be linked to the three-dimensional diffuser characteristics. Diffusers with an unstable near-field produce three-dimensional circulations which lead to recirculation at the diffuser line: effective control of these circulations is possible through horizontal nozzle orientation. The diffuser in an ambient cross-current is studied experimentally. Different extreme regimes of diffuser behaviour can be described. Performance is dependent on the arrangement of the diffuser axis with respect to the crossflow direction. Experiments are performed in two set-ups, investigating both two- dimensional <b>slots</b> and three-dimensional <b>diffusers.</b> Good agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results is found. The results of this study are presented in form of dilution graphs which can be used for three-dimensional diffuser design or preliminary design if proper schematization of the ambient geometry is possible. Design considerations are discussed and examples are given. For more complicated ambient conditions, hydraulic scale models are necessary. The results {{of this study indicate that}} only undistorted scale models simulate the correct areal extent of the temperature field and the interaction with currents, but are always somewhat conservative in dilution prediction. The degree of conservatism can be estimated. Distorted models are less conservative in predicting near-field dilutions, but exaggerate the extent of the near-field mixing zone.
