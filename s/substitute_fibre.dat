40|$|Politicians and {{planners}} in Europe and America in the 1930 s and 1940 s {{were increasingly}} {{anxious about the}} availability of wool for military requirements and actively encouraged research into <b>substitute</b> <b>fibres.</b> Innovation energised by the needs of war informed the development of processes to transform proteins normally used for food (milk, soya, corn, and fish) or perceived as waste (egg whites, chicken feathers and slaughter-house products) into fibres. This paper explores both innovative technology and conceptual models of innovation as applied to <b>substitute</b> <b>fibres</b> which were intended to result in both technical and cultural shifts. Substitute innovation was used to modify existing technology used to produce regenerated cellulosic fibres was modified to make regenerated protein fibres. Moderately successful in the unusual economic conditions of war and marketed as modernistic, patriotic and utopian fibres, regenerated protein fibres lost their price advantage to competing petrochemical fibres. Their physical disadvantages outweighed their benefits and they rapidly faded from popular memory and are only scantily represented in museum collections. The brief trajectory of these fibres prompted a revision of the traditional conceptualisation of innovation as developed by Usher and Schumpeter. Innovation is influenced by producers’ technological and tacit knowledge and skills and public policies. A new model of substitute innovation is proposed here to aid understanding of attitudes to the acceptability of new fibres which is relevant for the development, marketing and popular acceptance of today’s regenerated protein fibres. This paper will be illustrated with case studies of American and English fibres including Aralac, made from milk, Henry Ford’s soyabean fibre, Ardil made from peanuts and today’s milk and soyabean fibres, promoted as innovative, environmentally sensitive and health-giving...|$|R
40|$|The {{flexural}} behaviour {{of three different}} hybrid fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) matrix composites, i. e. S 2 -glass/E-glass/epoxy, TR 50 S carbon/IM 7 carbon/epoxy, and E-glass/TR 50 S carbon/epoxy hybrid FRP composites, has been investigated. The main objectives {{of this study were}} to: (i) improve the flexural properties of the parent composite materials, i. e. E-glass/epoxy and TR 50 S carbon fibre/epoxy composites, through substitution of stronger fibres, i. e. S 2 -glass and IM 7 carbon fibres, for the fibres of the parent composite materials, and (ii) determine the optimum stacking configurations that produced the maximum increase in flexural properties of the resulting hybrid composites. In addition to these, two secondary objectives related to the preliminary investigation of determining the optimum stacking configurations have also been established. The two secondary objectives were to: (i) determine the optimum values of the processing parameters of the composites under investigation, and (ii) determine the compressive strength and compressive modulus of the parent materials. The investigation was carried out experimentally, thus data presented and analysed were obtained from laboratory work. Optimum values of five processing parameters, i. e. (i) the concentration of matrix precursor within the solvent solution utilised to wet the fibres, (ii) the compressive pressure applied during hotpress curing, (iii) the vacuum pressure of the atmosphere inside the curing chamber, (iv) the dwell time during hot-press curing, and (v) the holding temperature during hot-press curing, have been established. The criteria for determining the optimum values of these parameters were optimum fibre content, minimum void content, and optimum flexural properties. Compressive strength and compressive modulus of the parent composite materials have also been determined. Specimens were cut from flat composite plates using a diamond-tipped circular blade saw. The longitudinal edges of the specimens were carefully polished to remove any possible edge damage due to cutting. The composite plates were produced from preforms comprised of a number of glass fibre/epoxy prepregs, carbon fibre/epoxy prepregs or a combination of these. All the fabrication procedures were carried out using manual techniques. Whilst the compressive tests were conducted in accordance with the ASTM D 3410 - 03 standard, flexural tests were carried out according to Procedure A of the ASTM D 790 - 07 standard. Span-to depth ratios, S/d, of 16, 32, and 64 were selected for flexural testing {{in order to determine the}} minimum value of S/d required to ensure flexural failure rather than shear failure. Fibre and void contents were evaluated from optical micrograph images of the slices perpendicular to the fibre direction of the samples. It was concluded that the optimum values of the five processing parameters under investigations were: (i) epoxy concentration, C[subscript]e ~ 50 wt%, (ii) compressive pressure, p[subscript]c ~ 1. 00 MPa, (iii) vacuum pressure, p[subscript]v ~ 0. 035 MPa, (iv) dwell time, t ~ 30 minutes, and (v) holding temperature, T ~ 120 °C. Compressive tests revealed that the order of compressive strength for the parent composite materials were arranged as follows: S 2 -glass fibre/epoxy (476 MPa), E-glass fibre/epoxy (430 MPa), IM 7 carbon fibre/epoxy (426 MPa), and TR 50 S carbon fibre/epoxy (384 MPa). The compressive modulus of these parent composite materials were found to be ordered as follows: IM 7 carbon fibre/epoxy (67. 9 GPa), TR 50 S carbon fibre/epoxy (61. 8 GPa), S 2 -glass fibre/epoxy (45. 1 GPa), and E-glass fibre/epoxy (32. 9 GPa). After considering these compressive properties, three different hybrid combinations, as mentioned earlier, were manufactured and evaluated with the prepreg layers of the fibre composites possessing higher compressive strength being placed at the compressively loaded side of the flexural specimens. Shorter beam specimens (S/d = 16) of the three hybrid systems exhibited increased flexural strength as the amount of stronger fibre content was increased, but no hybrid effect was noted. The increase appeared to follow the rule of mixtures and this was attributed to their failure mode being shear failure. For beams tested at S/d = 32 and S/d = 64, the three hybrid systems demonstrated three different trends. The S 2 -glass fibre/E-glass fibre/epoxy hybrid system, where the S 2 -glass <b>fibre</b> (<b>substituted</b> at the compressive loading face) was slightly stronger and stiffer compared to the E-glass fibre at the tensile side, demonstrated increases in flexural strength together with the presence of a hybrid effect following partial substitution of the S 2 -glass fibre for E-glass fibres at the compressive side. The IM 7 carbon fibre/TR 50 S carbon fibre/epoxy hybrid system, where the IM 7 carbon <b>fibre</b> (<b>substituted</b> at the compressive side) was slightly stronger but significantly stiffer in compression compared to the TR 50 S fibre at the tensile side, exhibited a slight increase in flexural strength that appeared to obey the rule of mixtures. This result was attributed to the strength increase in the compressive side introduced by the <b>substituted</b> <b>fibres</b> not being sufficient to suppress the increase of internal compressive stress due to the increase in compressive modulus of the <b>substituted</b> <b>fibres.</b> The E-glass fibre/TR 50 S carbon fibre/epoxy hybrid system, where the E-glass <b>fibre</b> (<b>substituted</b> at the compressive side) was found to be slightly stronger but significantly less stiff in compression compared to the TR 50 S fibre at the tensile side, demonstrated a significant increase in flexural modulus and also exhibited a significant hybrid effect. The decrease in internal compressive stresses generated at the compressive side due to the decreased compressive modulus of the <b>substituted</b> <b>fibre,</b> when combined with the increase in compressive strength of the <b>substituted</b> <b>fibre,</b> was thought to led to the significant increase of flexural strength for this hybrid system. General trends observed in flexural modulus for the three hybrid systems were reasonably similar with any change in flexural modulus appearing to obey the rule of mixtures. Whilst an increase in flexural modulus was noted for higher contents of stronger fibre in the case of the S 2 -glass fibre/E-glass fibre/epoxy hybrid system and IM 7 carbon fibre/TR 50 S carbon fibre/epoxy hybrid system, a decrease in flexural modulus with increased quantities of stronger fibre was exhibited by the E-glass fibre/TR 50 S carbon fibre/epoxy hybrid system. The increase or decrease in flexural modulus was attributed to the relative stiffness in compression of the <b>substituted</b> <b>fibre</b> when compared to that of the respective parent composite materials. Unlike the S 2 -glass fibre/E-glass fibre/epoxy hybrid system and IM 7 carbon fibre/TR 50 S carbon fibre/epoxy hybrid system that did not exhibit any significant trend with regards the effect of the substitution of stronger fibre at the compressive side, the E-glass fibre/TR 50 S carbon fibre hybrid system demonstrated a significant increase in the energy stored to maximum stress with increasing content of the stronger fibre. This increase was mainly attributed to the increased strain–to-maximum stress of the hybrid system with respect to that of the parent composite material. In addition, for the three hybrid systems under investigation, the most significant change in flexural properties was noticed following substitution of the first layer at the compressive face. The relative position with respect to the neutral plane of the substituted layer was thought to be the reason for this phenomenon. It was also noted that flexural properties increased with the increase in S/d. A change in failure morphology was noted with the change of S/d from 16 to 32. It was thus determined that a S/d ratio of at least 32 was required in order to promote flexural failure (as opposed to shear failure). For the S 2 -glass fibre/E-glass fibre/epoxy hybrid system, this change appeared more obvious in comparison with that the other two hybrid systems with this change being accompanied by a significant increase in flexural strength. The main general conclusions that could be drawn from this investigation were that, although the flexural modulus appeared to obey the rule of mixture, an increase in flexural strength together with the presence of a hybrid effect, would most probably be observed when the <b>fibre</b> <b>substituted</b> at the compressive side possessed a significantly lower modulus combined with significantly higher compressive strength as demonstrated by the hybrid TR 50 S carbon - E-glass FRP composites. The most significant change in properties was exhibited by the first layer substitution whilst increasing the value of S/d resulted in an increase of flexural strength, with S/d = 32 being determined to be sufficient in order to promote flexural failure as opposed to shear failure...|$|R

OBJECTIVES- The objective {{of this study is}} to provide a comprehensive review of the toxicity of some MMOFs currently used as asbestos substitute material and to prepare an analytical reference catalogue that would allow to identify these fibres in commercially available materials. METHODS- The diameters of 100 fibres each of polyacrylonitrile (PAN), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyethylene (PE) and aramids were measured by scanning electron microscopy. Each material was analyzed by diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFT) and X-ray diffractometry (XRD). RESULTS- The four materials examined for the purposes of this study were found to be non-respirable due to their geometric characteristics, since their average diameters were calculated at 10. 5 μm for PAN, 14. 20 μm for PVA, 20. 5 μm for PE and 11. 7 μm for aramid fibres. Only aramid fibres, which may produce fibrils of respirable size when subjected to abrasion or other types of stress, were found to have fibrils with a diameter of less than 1 μm.

VEGF-A and their soluble receptors, 5 vEGFR- 1, sVEGFR- 2, was determined in the conditioning medium of Angio-Kit system after fibre treatment. ROS formation and cell viability were evaluated in cultured endothelial cells (HUVEC). To evaluate the involvement of intracellular mechanisms, EGFR signalling, ROS formation and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF kappa B) pathway were then inhibited by incubating HUVEC cells with AG 1478, NAC and PDTC respectively, and the cytokine and growth factor release was analyzed in the culture medium after 7 days of fibre incubation. Among the mineral fibres tested, WFs markedly induced blood vessel formation which was associated with release of IL- 6 and IL- 8. VEGF-A and their soluble receptors. ROS production was observed in HUVEC after WFs treatment which was associated with cell cytotoxicity. The EGFR-induced ERK phosphorylation and ROS-mediated NF kappa B activation were involved in the cytokine and angiogenic factor release. However, only the EGFR activation was able to induce angiogenesis. The WFs are potential angiogenic agents that can induce regenerative cytokine and angiogenic factor production resulting in the formation of new blood vessels. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

A partial equilibrium forest sector model {{is applied to}} analyse effects on roundwood and forest products prices, quantities and trade of four alternative conservation extents. These alternatives {{are based on a}} recent biological analysis of the conservation needs in order to protect biodiversity in Norway. Roundwood prices are projected to increase moderately when conservation increases domestically only, since the Norwegian forest industry <b>substitutes</b> imported <b>fibre</b> for domestic. The impacts on roundwood prices are more substantial if also Norway’s forest products trading partners increase the forest conservation. If forest owners voluntarily conserve forests subject to an economic compensation (which currently is the most likely policy in Norway), the model results imply that forest owners on average are better off with increased conservation. Domestic sawnwood production is projected to reduce when assuming increasing forest conservation, while the production level in the pulp and paper industry is almost unaffected in the short-run. Finally, increasing demand for forest products as a result of “environmental good-will” may increase roundwood prices and harvest levels in unaffected forest areas significantly.

For material characterization purposes, tensile and flexural tests were carried out. Main properties of both materials, like elastic modulus, tensile strength or flexural modulus, are presented and compared with reference values. Afterwards, plates were drilled under two different feed rates: low and high, with two diverse tools: twist and brad type drill, while cutting speed was kept constant. Thrust forces during drilling were monitored. Then, delamination area around the hole was assessed by using digital images that were processed using a computational platform previously developed. Finally, drilled plates were mechanically tested for bearing and open-hole resistance. Results were compared and correlated with the measured delamination. Conclusions contribute to the understanding of natural fibres {{reinforced plastics}} as a <b>substitute</b> to glass <b>fibres</b> reinforced plastics, helping on cost reductions without compromising reliability, as well as the consequence of delamination on mechanical resistance of this type of composites...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{incorporation}} of Moringa leaf fibre (a by-product of leaf processing which contains 24 % Crude Fibre by dry weight at 0, 5 and 10 % substitution of wheat flour in cookies was investigated. Three products containing wheat flour: Moringa leaf fibre ratios of 100 : 0, 95 : 5, and 90 : 10 respectively were prepared, and a commercial cookie {{was used as}} a standard. Proximate composition of each of the products was determined and sensory evaluation of the cookies was performed on a 7 -point hedonic scale (with the standard commercial cookie as control) using a 20 -man sensory panel. There was no significant (P< 0. 05) difference in the dry matter content of the four samples. The 10 % Moringa leaf fibre cookie blend had the highest moisture, fat and crude fibre content (0. 57 % CF, relative to 0. 44 and 0. 54 % CF observed in the 0 : 100 and 5 : 95 recipes respectively), while the commercial cookie had the lowest values for these parameters (0. 36 % CF) but with highest value for protein. The 100 % wheat flour cookie ranked best in sensory evaluation, followed by the 5 % <b>fibre</b> <b>substituted</b> cookie. All the cookies were acceptable; scoring above 4 on the 7 -point hedonic scale. Addition of moringa leaf waste up to 10 % in cookies is feasible, though better at 5 %. Cookies with Moringa leaf by-product have the advantage of being good sources of some of the daily requirements of dietary fibre...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{concern has}} {{resulted}} in a renewed interest in bio-based materials. Among them, plant fibres are perceived as an environmentally friendly <b>substitute</b> to glass <b>fibres</b> for the reinforcement of composites, particularly in automotive engineering. Due to their wide availability, low cost, low density, high-specific mechanical properties and eco-friendly image, they are increasingly being employed as reinforcements in polymer matrix composites. Indeed, their complex microstructure as a composite material makes plant fibre a really interesting and challenging subject to study. Research subjects about such fibres are abundant because there are always some issues to prevent their use at large scale (poor adhesion, variability, low thermal resistance, hydrophilic behavior). The choice of natural fibres rather than glass fibres as filler yields a change of the final properties of the composite. One of the most relevant differences between the two kinds of fibre is their response to humidity. Actually, glass fibres are considered as hydrophobic whereas plant fibres have a pronounced hydrophilic behavior. Composite materials are often submitted to variable climatic conditions during their lifetime, including unsteady hygroscopic conditions. However, in humid conditions, strong hydrophilic behaviour of such reinforcing fibres leads to high level of moisture absorption in wet environments. This results in the structural modification of the fibres and an evolution of their mechanical properties together with the composites in which they are fitted in. Thereby, the understanding of these moisture absorption mechanisms as well as the influence of water on the final properties of these fibres and their composites is of great interest to get a better control of such new biomaterials. This is the topic of this review paper...|$|R
40|$|This {{final report}} {{describes}} {{the elaboration of}} a process solution concerning the production of injection moulding products in which glass <b>fibres</b> are <b>substituted</b> by natural <b>fibres.</b> This elaboration includes the agricultural production of raw materials (cultivation, harvest, roasting, primary processing), granulation (compounding) and injection moulding. Using model products, this process solution shall be assessed economically and ecologically. Fibres with different sort of flax, olein and hemp {{are used in the}} production of raw materials. According to the selection of fibre sorts, roasting and steps of preparing, the fibres have different physical properties. The length distribution and the amount of pectin, hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin are estimated. The technical production of natural fibre reinforced granular material is based on supplying of ready-made natural fibres. By concentration of the technical development on hemp fibres, a granular material of hemp fibres -polypropylene being able for injection molding is developed under the trademark FORPOLEN "r"e"g"i"s"t"e"r"e"d HF. This material has an increased tensile strength and a reduced impact behavior. With respect to the injection moulding process of natural fibre reinforced granular materials, the tools and processing parameters have to be adapted individually. Furthermore, the thermal load of the fibre compound has to be reduced by use of low residence time. Because of the ability to sorb water, natural fibres require drying processes in all processing steps. The ecological advantages of injection moulding products of hemp fibre-polypropylene are based on photosynthetic advance and on their low mass. Hemp fibre products are more low-priced than glass fibre products.

40|$|Today, global {{environmental}} issues, such as {{global warming and}} fossil depletion, drive a paradigm shift in material applications from conventional fossil sources to renewable sources. Following this trend, the topic of this thesis is to analyse the use of biobased resources for fibre reinforced composite fabrication. Currently {{the most widely used}} fibre reinforced composites are composed of glass fibre reinforcements and polymeric matrices. In this thesis, the biobased alternative, i. e. flax fibre, {{which is one of the}} most widely used natural fibres, is studied as a glass <b>fibre</b> <b>substitute</b> from an environmental impact point of view. Moreover, a newly emerging biobased polymer, the wheat gluten, is analysed in the study; and it is compared to a conventional polymer and to a commercially available biobased polymer from environmental impact perspective. The main question addressed in this thesis is whether there are general environmental advantages for the use of flax fibres over glass fibres, and for the wheat gluten polymer over petrochemical polymers. Although biobased materials are often perceived to be environmentally friendly, an in-depth analysis is still needed to answer this question. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is considered to be an appropriate tool for environmental impact quantification. The thesis addresses the following research objectives: (i) to deliver life cycle inventory data for the flax fibre and wheat gluten; (ii) to perform LCA studies on flax fibres compared to glass fibres in composite reinforcement applications and on wheat gluten polymer compared to the conventional low density polyethylene (LDPE) and commercially available biobased polymer polylactic acid (PLA); (iii) to conduct an in-depth analysis concerning sensitivity and uncertainty to obtain information on the robustness of the obtained results. As the initial step, a detailed life cycle inventory for flax cultivation in Northern France is documented. Field emissions associated with the nitrogen cycle are estimated both from a process-oriented DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) method and the generic Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method. Since the IPCC method is derived from field measurements at sites with various soil types, climate conditions, and crops, it is subject to relatively large uncertainty. In contrast, the outputs from the DNDC method are believed to be more accurate because this method is constructed based on complex biochemical models from soil science and makes use of site specific data. The comparison of the results lead to the conclusion that the emission factors from the DNDC method and the recommended values from the IPCC method for flax cultivation in Northern France are quite different. The DNDC based emission factor for direct N 2 O emission, which is a strong greenhouse gas, is by a quarter to half lower than the recommended emission factor according to the IPCC method. The DNDC method leads to a reduction of 17 % in the impact category of climate change per kg retted flax straw production in comparison to the level obtained from the IPCC method. Different co-product accounting principles: mass allocation, economic allocation, and system expansion are investigated for the flax fibre extraction process. The impact results per kg flax hackled long fibre show that economic allocation and system expansion lead to similar values, while the mass allocation approach leads to significantly lower values among all impact categories. Furthermore, methods including the statistical fitting, qualitative judgement, and expert-judgement are integrated to parameterise the important inventory data to run a Monte-Carlo simulation for uncertainty analysis. In the case of the climate change impact category, the uncertainty levels through the mass allocation, economic allocation, and system expansion are compared for the results. It is found that the system expansion approach implies the highest level of uncertainty due to inclusion of additional external processes, while the mass allocation leads to the lowest uncertainty. The uncertainty level related to economic allocation is significantly higher than the mass allocation, which can be caused by fluctuating prices of flax (co-) products. With a reliable impact assessment on flax fibre production and with the economic allocation method is used, the study further extends to a comparison of flax fibres and glass fibres in composite applications. The Ashby method is used to ensure functionally equivalent designs. A so-called life cycle environmental impact indicator (LEI) has been introduced. Such LEI is derived from the material mass indices illustrated in the Ashy method. The material mass indices contain only material intrinsic properties and are proportional to the product mass while ensuring equal functionality (e. g. stiffness, strength, etc.) for a specified structure and loading type. Then the LEI can be constructed by using unit environmental impact values (e. g. climate change, fossil depletion, and etc.) in production, use, and EoL, and multiplying these with the mass indices. The LEI highlights three important variables severely influencing the outcome of comparative studies based on this indicator method: the replacement ratio, the specific fuel saving (in case of transport applications), and the fibre volume fraction. The first parameter addresses the concern that flax FRPs are likely to fail earlier than conventional FRPs. Therefore, more flax FRP components are needed for the expected lifespan. The specific fuel saving denotes how much fuel can be saved by a certain weight reduction over a total transport distance. Since flax fibres have a much lower density than conventional glass fibres, flax FRPs can facilitate structures with reduced weight. Therefore flax FPRs are likely to contribute to lower fuel consumption rates. The third parameter, the flax volume fraction, influences the mechanical properties of flax FRPs. Constructed on the polypropylene (PP) matrix, two types of flax FRP products: the flax mat-PP (panel) and short flax fibre-PP (strut), produced via compression moulding and injection moulding, respectively, have been evaluated for multiple impact categories using the ReCiPe method for fixed values of the fibre volume fraction and specific fuel reduction. Compared to a 9 kg glass mat-PP with 20 vol% fibre content, with the equal stiffness criterion under bending, the flax mat-PP with 20 vol% leads to a reduced mass design (7. 8 kg). In contrast, with an equal stiffness criterion under tension, the short flax fibre-PP is similarily heavy (9. 2 kg) as the corresponding GFRP (9 kg). The LCA study compared the environmental impact of flax FRPs and GFRPs within Europe in non-transport use (production plus EoL phases) and transport use. Over the production and EoL phases, the flax mat-PP exhibits lower values for most environmental impact categories than its corresponding glass fibre based counterpart. For most categories, the reductions can reach 20 %~ 50 %. In particular, a 23 % reduction in the climate change category and a 24 % reduction in fossil depletion are documented. Moreover, for the impact categories of ozone depletion and human toxicity reductions of up to 70 % can be achieved. On the other hand, replacing the short glass fibre-PP by short flax fibre-PP only results in modest environmental impact reductions in multiple impact categories, including the impact categories of climate change and fossil depletion where only reductions of around 10 % are recorded. Coming to the full life cycle impact, the saved fuel consumption during the use phase could be very significant depending on the lifetime distance travelled. In 14 out of 17 impact categories, lower life cycle impact results can be observed for the flax mat-PP. However, in case of the short flax fibre-PP compared to short glass fibre-PP, the two material systems lead to very similar environmental impact values in multiple categories due to their very similar mass. Subsequently, a consequential life cycle analysis (CLCA) is conducted to capture how overall environmental impact will change when shifting from glass fibres to flax fibres as reinforcements in composite fabrication. With certain assumptions, the marginal flax fibre supply is identified to be a combination of Chinese flax fibre (70 %) and French flax fibre (30 %). Due to inferior cultivars and coal-fired electricity in Chinese flax cultivation, the CLCA study reveals that flax mat-PP has 0. 8 ~ 2 times higher environmental impact values than the glass mat-PP in most environmental impact categories over the production and end-of-life (EoL) phases. For the purpose of providing potential trajectories of marginal flax fibre supply, additional all French fibre, and all Chinese fibre scenarios are also evaluated, formulating the lower and upper boundaries in terms of environmental impact change, respectively. The attributional fibre supply mix scenario is supplied as well. The all French fibre scenario leads to better scores than glass fibre composites in most impact categories; while the break-even mix lies at attributional supply mix scenario since it presents a close eco-profile to that of glass mat-PP. All of these scenarios are useful for policy analysis. Finally, the study quantifies the life cycle impact for wheat gluten based materials. The contribution serves as a base assessment which can feed into the evaluation of any future wheat-gluten based product. The study evaluates wheat gluten based packaging film and compares it with low density polyethylene LDPE and PLA film over the life cycle of these products. Scenarios including extrusion and casting for film production; incineration with energy recovery and composting for end-of-life treatments are evaluated. The comparison offers insight into the environmental benefits of using wheat gluten over conventional plastic film as well as its|$|R
