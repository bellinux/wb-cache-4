5|$|Development of <b>Silent</b> Hill {{started in}} September 1996. The game {{was created by}} Team <b>Silent,</b> a group of staff members within the Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo studio. The new owners of its parent company Konami sought to produce a game that would be {{successful}} in the United States. For this reason, a Hollywood-like atmosphere was proposed for <b>Silent</b> Hill. The staff members that were assigned to the game's development had failed at their previous projects. They intended to leave Konami, as they were not allowed to realize their own ideas, and were not compatible with the company's other teams. According to composer Akira Yamaoka, the developers {{did not know how to}} proceed with the <b>Silent</b> Hill project, either. As the time passed, the personnel and management of Konami lost their faith in the game, and the members of Team <b>Silent</b> increasingly felt like outsiders. Despite the profit-oriented approach of the parent company, however, the developers of <b>Silent</b> Hill had much artistic freedom because the game was still produced as in the era of lower-budget 2D titles. Eventually, the development staff decided to ignore the limits of Konami's initial plan, and to make <b>Silent</b> Hill a game that would appeal to the emotions of players instead.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the fourth}} <b>Silent</b> Hill game by Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo's {{development}} group Team <b>Silent</b> began shortly {{after the release of}} <b>Silent</b> Hill 2 and alongside <b>Silent</b> Hill 3, with the intentions of creating a new style of game that would take the series in a different direction than the previous games. Despite what has been popularized around the Internet, <b>Silent</b> Hill 4 was always meant to be connected to <b>Silent</b> Hill and not an unrelated separate horror game that later became a <b>Silent</b> Hill title, although different gameplay mechanics and change were intended. News of the game's development was made public by October 2003, and official announcements by Konami followed at Gamers' Day 2004. The game was produced by the series' recurring sound designer and composer Akira Yamaoka. Its working title, prior to its incorporation into the rest of the series, was simply Room 302.|$|E
5|$|Pyramid Head {{has since}} {{appeared}} in other media {{in and outside}} the <b>Silent</b> Hill media franchise. Positively received in <b>Silent</b> Hill 2 {{for his role as}} an element of James' psyche, he has been cited by reviewers as an iconic villain of the series and part of <b>Silent</b> Hill 2s appeal.|$|E

For example, The <b>Silents</b> used the acronym TSL; this acronym is visible in Motorhead on banners and signs. According to the Motorhead manual, TSL is said to stand for [...] "Trans-atlantic Speed League", {{a case of a}} backronym.|$|R
