The hole-free property makes it easier to perform beamforming and DOA estimation in the coarray domain which behaves like an uniform linear array. The O(N^ 2) property implies that O(N^ 2) uncorrelated sources can be identified. For the 2 -D case, planar <b>sparse</b> <b>arrays</b> with hole-free coarrays having O(N^ 2) elements have also been known for a long time.

In these applications, <b>sparse</b> <b>arrays</b> such as minimum redundancy arrays, nested arrays, and coprime arrays can be exploited to resolve uncorrelated sources using physical sensors. Recently, {{it has been shown that}} correlation subspaces, which reveal the structure of the covariance matrix, help to improve some existing DOA estimators. However, the bases, the dimension, and other theoretical properties of correlation subspaces remain to be investigated. This paper proposes generalized correlation subspaces in one and multiple dimensions. This leads to new insights into correlation subspaces and DOA estimation with prior knowledge. First, it is shown that the bases and the dimension of correlation subspaces are fundamentally related to difference coarrays, which were previously found to be important in the study of <b>sparse</b> <b>arrays.</b> Furthermore, generalized correlation subspaces can handle certain forms of prior knowledge about source directions. These results allow one to derive a broad class of DOA estimators with improved performance.

40|$|Mutual {{coupling}} between sensors has {{a negative}} impact on the estimation of directions of arrival (DOAs). <b>Sparse</b> <b>arrays</b> such as nested arrays, coprime arrays, and minimum redundancy arrays (MRAs) have less mutual coupling than uniform linear <b>arrays</b> (ULAs). These <b>sparse</b> <b>arrays</b> also have a difference coarray of size O(N^ 2), where N is the number of sensors, and can therefore resolve O(N^ 2) uncorrelated source directions. The various <b>sparse</b> <b>arrays</b> proposed in the literature have their pros and cons. The nested array is practical and easy to use but has a dense ULA part which suffers from mutual coupling effects like the traditional ULA. The recently introduced super nested arrays reduce this mutual coupling problem, while maintaining the desirable hole-free O(N^ 2) difference coarray of the nested array. In this paper, a generalization of super nested arrays is introduced, called the Qth-order super nested array.
