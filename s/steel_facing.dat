The sequence and location of the forge-welds varied between different anvil makers {{and the kind of}} anvil being made. At the same time cast iron anvils with <b>steel</b> <b>faces</b> were being made in the United States.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide and verify a new design method for the in-plane compressive strength of steel sandwich panels comprised of <b>steel</b> <b>face</b> sheets and foamed steel cores. Foamed steel, literally steel with internal voids, provides enhanced bending rigidity, exceptional energy dissipation, and the potential to mitigate local instability. In this work, Winterâ€™s effective width expression is generalized to the case of steel foam sandwich panels. The generalization requires modification of the elastic buckling expressions to account for panel non-composite bending rigidity and shear deformations. In addition, an equivalent yield stress is introduced to provide a single parameter description of the yielding behavior of the <b>steel</b> <b>face</b> sheets and <b>steel</b> foam core. The provided analytical expressions are verified with finite element simulations employing three-dimensional continuum elements and calibrated constitutive models specific to metallic foams. The developed closed-form design expressions are employed to conduct parametric studies of steel foam sandwich panels, which (a) demonstrate the significant strength improvements possible when compared with solid steel, and (b) provide insights on the optimal balance between <b>steel</b> <b>face</b> sheet thickness and density of the foamed steel core.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the present study is to {{simulate}} the load-deflection of steel sandwich panel under four-point bending finite element formulation. The panels were made of steel facings and I type steel stiffeners. The deflection and stress-strain curves of the steel sandwich panels have been preserved. Finite element were developed using ANSYS software. The analytical solution of steel sandwich panel has been made for a monolith material with equivalent properties. Next step was the development of laser welded sandwich panels with composite coating to achieve stiffness properties of steel sandwich panels under previous conditions. The bending contribution to the laser welded sandwich panels deflection was calculated and compared with the corresponding bending contribution of the steel sandwich panels. Preliminary work has been done to investigate an influence of parameters (thickness of <b>steel</b> <b>facing,</b> thickness of composite coating, angle of composite fibers) on the stiffness properties. Investigation of the laser welded sandwich panel through the parametric dates confirmed the results obtained for steel sandwich plate.

"Thesis supervisor: Dr. Sanjeev K. Khanna. Today, armor protection {{is one of the}} most important elements of survivability. So developing materials which can withstand all futuristic threats, including those from terrorism has therefore become very critical. Polymer matrix composites (PMCs) are attractive materials in this regard because they are lighter, stronger, and stiffer than unreinforced polymers. Along with PMCs, steel and aluminum alloys are also used in light weight armor materials against projectile impact. The laminated composite materials in which different layers of different materials are bonded together are becoming a key material for future lightweight military, marine, and aerospace hardware as they incorporate high hardness and sufficiently high toughness simultaneously. In this study a layered composite panel of steel and aluminum layers has been bonded with graphene reinforced polyurethane. Four types of laminated panels were fabricated with <b>steel</b> <b>facing</b> plate followed by a combination of various aluminum alloy layers. The average weight of a 7 -layer laminated composite was 7 lb/ftÂ² and that of 9 -layer laminated composites was 10 lb/ftÂ². Different tests, such as tensile test, lap shear strength test, and three-point bend test, have been conducted on the fabricated panels to determine their mechanical properties. The composite laminates' bending stiffness was modeled using ABAQUS finite element software and validated by experiments. The effect of a ballistic impact with armor piercing ammunition was also conducted to qualitatively measure their relative resistance to failure under ballistic loading.

50|$|The common blacksmith's anvil is made {{of either}} forged or cast steel, forged wrought iron with a hard <b>steel</b> <b>face</b> or cast iron with a hard <b>steel</b> <b>face.</b> Cast iron anvils are not used for forging as they are {{incapable}} of {{standing up to the}} impact and will crack and dent. Also, cast iron anvils without a hard <b>steel</b> <b>face</b> do not have the rebound that a harder anvil would and will tire out the smith. Historically, some anvils have been made with a smooth top working <b>face</b> of hardened <b>steel</b> welded to a cast iron or wrought iron body, though this manufacturing method is no longer in use. At one end, the common smith's anvil has a projecting conical bick (beak, horn) used for hammering curved work pieces. The other end is typically called the heel. Occasionally, the other end is also provided with a bick, partly rectangular in section. Most anvils made since the late 18th century also have a hardy hole and a pritchel hole where various tools, such as the anvil-cutter or hot chisel, can be inserted and held by the anvil. Some anvils have several hardy and pritchel holes, to accommodate a wider variety of hardy tools and pritchels. An anvil may also have a softer pad for chisel work.|$|R
40|$|The current {{trend in}} the machine tools market is to produce {{machines}} capable of faster cutting speeds.

40|$|Pile driving {{associated}} with the removal and reconstruction of a jetty was monitored at a busy harbor in the North East of Scotland, adjacent to an important Atlantic salmon river. The main concern was {{with the impact of}} noise upon salmon migrating through {{the lower part of the}} river estuary. Pile driving was allowed to proceed subject to an agreed program of works to monitor sound levels and ensure least disturbance to salmon. Both percussive and vibratory pile driving took place. Sound-pressure levels from both were measured. Percussive pile driving involved the repeated striking of the head of a steel pile by a double-acting hydraulic hammer, with a 5 tonne ram weight operated with a mean stroke of about 1 m. Vibratory pile driving was achieved by means of a variable eccentric vibrator attached to the head of the pile. The majority of piles were initially driven into the substrate by vibration, over a period of several minutes. Each pile was then subsequently driven to its full depth with a sequence of repeated hammer blows. <b>Steel</b> <b>facing</b> piles were inserted adjacent to the quayside and subsequently backfilled to provide a new frontage to the quay. Diagonal-bearing piles were also inserted well behind the quay to strengthen the adjacent roadway. Sound pressure levels generated by pile driving in water were measured using a calibrated hydrophone suspended 1 m above the bottom. The hydrophone was connected to a low-noise amplifier, which controlled the signal gain and bandwidth. The output was connected to a laptop PC by a digital audio interface. When recording at close range, where sound levels were especially high, a less-sensitive hydrophone transducer was used, connected directly to the audio interface. All sound recordings were made as 16 -bit WAV files. For some of the piles, particle-velocity amplitudes were measured by means of an assembly of three orthogonally mounted, calibrated geophones placed on the seabed. The sound-pressure levels (SPL) of the background noise and vibro-piling noise were measured as a root-mean-square (rms) level expressed in decibels relative to a reference level of one micro Pascal (dB re 1 Î¼Pa). The shorter-duration impulsive sounds generated by the individual blows of the pile-driver hammer were measured in several different ways: the peak pressure reached during the impulse, the rms pressure measured over the time period that contained 90 % of the sound energy (rms impulse), and as the sound-exposure level (SEL) expressed in dB re 1 Î¼Pa 2 -s. The latter was defined as the constant sound level of 1 s duration that would contain the same acoustic energy as the original sound. Sound levels were converted to source levels (SL), i. e., normalized to an equivalent noise level at a distance of 1 m. In all SL calculations, it was assumed that the spreading loss was represented by the expression 15 log R where R was the distance in meters. Received sound level in water may be expressed in terms of sound pressure, particle velocity, or intensity, all of which can vary with time over the duration of the sound. In this study, the majority of measurements were expressed in terms of sound pressure. However, it was recognised that it was really necessary to determine the particle velocities as this is the stimulus which is received by the ear of a fish like the salmon. On a few occasions, the particle velocities were measured and the acoustic intensity calculated. Background-noise levels within the harbor and even within the river itself were high, within the range 118 â€“ 149 dB re 1 Î¼Pa rms over a bandwidth of 10 Hz- 10 kHz. Much of the noise derived from manoeuvring and stationary ships. The sound-pressure levels generated in water by percussive pile driving were very high, but variable depending on the pile type, the substrate being penetrated, the distance from the source, and whether the bubble curtain was in operation. Within the harbor, they ranged from 142 - 176 dB re 1 Î¼Pa peak, with sound exposure levels (SELs) of between 133 - 154 dB re 1 Î¼Pa 2 -s, without the bubble curtain in operation. Estimated source levels ranged from 177 - 202 dB re 1 Î¼Pa peak. Within the river, more than 220 meters away from the pile driver and separated from it by a spit of land, the soundpressure levels reaching the fish ranged from 162 - 168 dB re 1 Î¼Pa peak, with SELs of between 129 - 145 dB re 1 Î¼Pa 2 -s. Sounds measured at a distance from the source within the harbor consisted of a low-frequency pre-pulse, followed by the main sound pulse. In this case, and in the river itself, the sound was propagated through the substrate, as well as the water, perhaps accompanied by flexural waves at interfaces between strata. Particle velocities within the harbor and in the river reached 110 dB re 1 nms- 1, mainly in a vertical direction, and intensities of up to 0. 023 Wm- 2 were registered. Chapter 2 22 ICOET 2005 Proceedings The main energy generated by the percussive pile driver extended up to and above 10 kHz close to the source, with most of the energy below 2 kHz. By the time the sound reached the river the higher frequencies had been removed and the predominant frequencies were below 1 kHz, still with considerable energy within the hearing range of salmon (which declines above 250 Hz). Vibro-piling also generated high sound levels in water, with sound-pressure levels within the harbor ranging from 142 - 155 dB re 1 Î¼Pa rms and source levels between 173 - 185 dB re 1 Î¼Pa rms. Levels in the river ranged from 140 - 143 dB re 1 Î¼Pa rms. A bubble curtain was successful in reducing the peak amplitude of the sound from the pile driver by up to 5 dB and in reducing the high-frequency content of the sound. The bubbles therefore reduced the likelihood of damage or injury to fish. However, they did not reduce energy at the lower frequencies to which fish are sensitive, especially at a distance from the source. The principal purpose of monitoring the pile driving was to assess the impact upon salmon. There is some controversy and uncertainty about the actual levels of pile-driving sound which affect fish adversely. It is evident that sound affects different species to a differing degree. Thus, although in some instances a level of 180 db re 1 Î¼Pa has been adopted as a standard, above which sounds are likely to kill or cause damage to fish, this is a very uncertain figure which is open to question. It was concluded that the sound pressure levels (SPLs) and sound exposure levels (SELs) generated by percussive pile driving within the harbor were not likely to have killed fish, whether the fish were within the river or the harbor itself. However, the sound levels were high enough close to the pile driver to injure or induce hearing loss in some species of fish. The noise from pile driving in the harbor was certainly high enough to be detected by salmon in the river at considerable distances from the source. The levels of sound from both percussive and vibro-piling were well above the hearing thresholds of the fish. As salmon could not be observed during this exercise, it was not possible to determine whether salmon reacted adversely to the sounds. However, there was a risk that their upstream migration may have been delayed or prevented with consequent effects upon spawning populations. The measurements indicated that any pile driving within the river itself would have the potential to injure or induce hearing loss in salmon and might have adverse effects upon their behavior. During this exercise, trains of low frequency â€˜thumpingâ€™ sounds were recorded within the River Dee, similar to those made by fish. The sounds may be emitted by European eels, which are common at the location...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{deals with}} the overall {{structural}} stability of sandwich panels used as ceilings and fire walls when exposed to fire on one side. Only panels with flat <b>steel</b> <b>faces</b> are considered. Simple mechanisms of instability are described, load actions are quantified, and practical design guidance is given to ensure stability i. e., resistance to overall collapse. The analysis for ceilings assumes that, after delamination of the fire exposed <b>steel</b> <b>face</b> due to softening of the adhesive, the panel faces act as catenaries, and calculations are made of mid-span deflection and the catenary force needed to resist collapse. This method is being considered {{in the work of}} European committee CEN TC 127 with regard to the development of rules for extended applications for construction products. The analysis for internal fire walls takes account of wind pressure. The importance of achieving adequate panel-end restraint is demonstrated.
