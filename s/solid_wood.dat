25|$|A <b>solid</b> <b>wood</b> {{floor is}} a floor laid with planks or battens created {{from a single}} piece of timber, usually a hardwood. Since wood is hydroscopic (it acquires and loses {{moisture}} from the ambient conditions around it) this potential instability effectively limits the length and width of the boards.|$|E

For that purpose, it is important and necessary to make clear the sawing-force components and the sawing phenomena. But few studies have dealt with the exact measurements of them, and so, the main objective {{of this study is to}} obtain quantitative information on them. In this study. the basic sawing tests of <b>solid</b> <b>woods</b> and wood based materials were performed, using an experimental apparatus designed for sawing with a fret saw blade. The main (Fp) and thrust (Fq) components of the sawing force were measured, And in addition to measurement of these components, the several sawing phenomena were observed and measured. Based on these results the sawing characteristics were discussed...|$|R

25|$|Wood to be {{used for}} {{construction}} work is commonly known as lumber in North America. Elsewhere, lumber usually refers to felled trees, and the word for sawn planks ready for use is timber. In Medieval Europe oak was the wood of choice for all wood construction, including beams, walls, doors, and floors. Today a wider variety of woods is used: <b>solid</b> <b>wood</b> doors are often made from poplar, small-knotted pine, and Douglas fir.|$|E

They are sometimes used with <b>solid</b> <b>wood,</b> replacing {{mortise and tenon}} joints as they are easier to make and almost as strong. They are also used to align pieces of wood when joined edge-to-edge in making wider panels. It is important {{to use the same}} face when cutting the slots, so the boards are perfectly flush.|$|E
25|$|The Asian long-horned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis), {{also known}} as the starry sky, sky beetle, or ALB, is native to eastern China, Japan, and Korea. This species has now been accidentally {{introduced}} into the United States, where it was first discovered in 1996, as well as Canada, and several countries in Europe, including Austria, France, Germany, Italy and UK.

Often sold as low-cost kits, cardboard dulcimers offer surprisingly good sound and volume. Their low cost and resistance to damage make them particularly suited to institutional settings, such as elementary school classrooms.|$|R

25|$|<b>Solid</b> <b>wood</b> products, {{particularly}} flooring, {{are often}} specified in environments where occupants {{are known to}} have allergies to dust or other particulates. Wood itself is considered to be hypo-allergenic and its smooth surfaces prevent the buildup of particles common in soft finishes like carpet. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of American recommends hardwood, vinyl, linoleum tile or slate flooring instead of carpet. The use of wood products can also improve air quality by absorbing or releasing moisture in the air to moderate humidity.|$|E

40|$|Various adverse {{cutaneous}} reactions {{may occur}} {{as a result of}} exposure to <b>wood</b> dust or <b>solid</b> <b>woods.</b> These include allergic contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis and, more rarely, contact urticaria, photoallergic and phototoxic reactions. Also cases of erythema multiforme-like reactions have been reported. Contact dermatitis, both allergic and irritant, is most frequently provoked by exotic woods, e. g. wood of the Dalbergia spp., Machaerium scleroxylon or Tectona grandis. Cutaneous reactions are usually associated with manual or machine woodworking, in occupational setting or as a hobby. As a result of exposure to wood dust, airborne contact dermatitis is often diagnosed. Cases of allergic contact dermatitis due to <b>solid</b> <b>woods</b> of finished articles as jewelry or musical instruments have also been reported. The aim of the paper is to present various adverse skin reactions related to exposure to woods, their causal factors and sources of exposure, based on the review of literature.

25|$|Most {{workbenches}} {{are made}} from solid wood; the most expensive and desirable are made of solid hardwood. Benches may also be made from plywood and Masonite or hardboard, and bases of treated pine and even steel. There are trade offs with the choice of construction material. <b>Solid</b> <b>wood</b> has many advantages including strength, workability, appearance. A plywood or hardboard bench top {{has the advantage of}} being stable, relatively inexpensive, and in some ways it's easier to work with - particularly for a woodworker who doesn't yet have hand tools. The practical drawbacks of a plywood or composite bench top are that they don't hold their corners and edges well, and they can't be resurfaced with a plane - something that is needed from time to time.|$|E
25|$|SY Aurora was a barque-rigged steam yacht {{built by}} Alexander Stephen and Sons Ltd. in Dundee, Scotland, in 1876, for the Dundee Seal and Whale Fishing Company. It was 165' long with a 30' beam. The hull {{was made of}} oak, {{sheathed}} with greenheart and lined with fir. The bow was a mass of <b>solid</b> <b>wood</b> reinforced with steel-plate armour. The heavy side frames were braced by two levels of horizontal oak beams. Her primary use was whaling in the northern seas, and she was built sturdily enough to withstand the heavy weather and ice that would be encountered there. That strength proved useful for Antarctic exploration as well, and between 1911 and 1917 she made five trips to the continent, both for exploration as well as rescue missions.|$|E

50|$|Engineered wood {{products}} can be stronger than hardwood because layering methods increase the strength. They are sometimes used just at critical stress areas when maximum strength is needed. Modern furniture making, however, tends {{to rely upon}} a combination of engineered <b>woods</b> and <b>solid</b> <b>woods</b> in frame making. Engineered {{wood products}} commonly used in furniture making include plywood, hardboard, millboard, chipboard, and medium-density fiberboard. Upholstery itself is often applied with staples, and so metal frames will typically have a plywood panel inserted into them as a backer for the upholstery and to allow these staples to be pinned into it.|$|R
25|$|The {{eucalyptus}} species most planted are E. grandis, E. globulus and E. dunnii; {{they are}} used mainly for pulp mills. Approximately 80,000 ha of E. grandis situated in the departments of Rivera, TacuarembÃ³ and PaysandÃº is primarily earmarked for the <b>solid</b> <b>wood</b> market, although a portion of it is used for sawlogs and plywood. The current area under commercial forest plantation is 6% of the total. The main uses of the wood produced are elemental chlorine free pulp mill production (for cellulose and paper), sawlogs, plywood and bioenergy (thermoelectric generation). Most of the products obtained from sawmills and pulp mills, as well as plywood and logs, are exported. This has raised the income of this sector with respect to traditional products from other sectors. Uruguayan forestry plantations have rates of growth of 30 cubic metres per hectare per year and commercial harvesting occurs after 9 years.|$|E
25|$|The current Church now {{occupies}} {{what used}} to be the choir and the sanctuary areas. This is separated from the open court by a solid red brick wall, of Middle Ages construction with doors and windows. The original sanctuary was built in a trefoil style with three apses. It is a step higher than the nave in the open court. The rectangular space defined by the apses to its north, south, and east sides; used to serve as the altar for the greater basilica. Now the altar is located within the central or eastern apse. The rest of the space is now integrated into the nave of the current Church. There is also a new iconstasis made with <b>solid</b> <b>wood</b> and adorned by small icons on its top register. The current sanctuary in the central apse is actually divided into three. The middle one is dedicated to Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite, the southern one to the Virgin Mary, and the northern one to Saint George.|$|E
