25|$|In the {{economic}} and technological circumstances of the time such an entrepôt (or to use the Dutch term: stapelmarkt) fulfilled important functions. The word has connotations of a duty-free port, but in an economic sense, a stapelmarkt {{was a place where}} commodities were temporarily physically stocked for future reexport. This was viable because of a legal monopoly for stockpiling a single commodity (wool), granted by a political ruler (like the staple ports designated by the kings of England in medieval times), but also more generally because of technical and economic reasons that still give certain advantages to a spoke-hub distribution paradigm. An important ancillary function of such a physical <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> <b>commodities</b> is that it makes it easier for merchants to even out supply fluctuations, and hence to control price gyrations in thin and volatile markets. Finally, where a physical market forms, market information can more easily be gathered. This was actually the most important economic function of a stapelmarkt in the primitive circumstances of the late 16th century.|$|E

40|$|The {{analytical}} {{starting point}} determines {{the course of}} a theoretical investigation and ultimately the productiveness of an approach. The classics took production and accumulation as their point of departure, the neoclassics exchange. Exchange implies behavioral assumptions and notions like rationality, optimization, and equilibrium. It is widely recognized that this approach has led into a cul-de-sac. To change a theory means to change its premises or, in Keynes’s words, to ‘throw over’ the axioms. The present paper swaps the standard behavioral axioms for structural axioms and applies the latter to the analysis of the emergence of secondary markets from the flow part of the economy. Real and nominal residuals at first give rise to the accumulation of the stock of money and the <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> <b>commodities.</b> These stocks constitute the demand and supply side of secondary markets. The pricing in these markets is different from the pricing in the primary markets. Realized appreciation in the secondary markets is different from income or profit. To treat primary and secondary markets alike is therefore a category mistake. Vice versa, to take a set of objective propositions as analytical starting point yields a comprehensive and consistent theory of market exchange and valuation. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} studies {{the ability of}} 11 combat logistics force (CLF) ships and four transport aircraft to support building and sustaining operations at four maritime patrol and reconnaissance military airbases throughout the African continent. We have implemented a traditional hub and spoke (HandS) concept with sample demand data provided by the staff of Commander, Patrol and Reconnaissance Force Seventh Fleet, in a hypothetical situation where U. S. forces are required to assist the Nigerian government. We use the CLF Planner optimization tool to obtain shuttle schedules for three scenarios of daily demands of four commodities. One scenario requires the buildup of an airbase within seven days, {{and the other two}} require so in three days. All CLF shuttles have been randomly selected, positioned and loaded with commodities. Depending on the length of the buildup phase and the initial <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> <b>commodities</b> at the HandS, we find that the continuous sustainment operations (over a 45 -day planning horizon) may not be feasible in some cases. Specifically, if a short buildup phase is required, we recommend the prepositioning of commodities at a minimum of 25 % of daily demands, and dedicated air shuttles carrying only ordnance.

40|$|Policy (CAP) {{began in}} the mid- 1980 s. At that time, the CAP {{was the victim of}} its own success. Production had {{increased}} considerably, and <b>stocks</b> <b>of</b> <b>commodities</b> were accumulating. Conflicts with the United States over the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade were increasing, and there were calls for reform. The 1992 CAP reform was a major turning point—intervention price levels were drastically reduced toward international market prices, and direct payments to farmers were established. The reform had mixed results, but it initiated a serious, broad debate about the role of agriculture in European society. This debate is still open. This paper will explore the future of the CAP using three scenarios. First, the context of th...|$|R
