5|$|According to Burton Fisher, Puccini and Forzano {{borrowed}} {{heavily from}} the commedia dell'arte tradition in Gianni Schicchi. Schicchi himself recalls the roguish Harlequin, while his daughter Lauretta, whose romance is nearly foiled by Buoso's relatives, resembles Columbina. Simone {{is drawn from}} Pantaloon, while the poverty-stricken Betto recalls the buffoonish valet Zany. Doctor Spinelloccio recalls the classic doctor from the commedia dell'arte, Balanzone even to his Bolognese origin. The Moor whose death momentarily <b>scares</b> <b>the</b> relatives, and his captain, are stock characters from commedia dell'arte.|$|E

5|$|They {{arrive at}} a cave. Tintin ventures inside and finds Chang, who is feverish and shaking. The Yeti {{suddenly}} appears, revealed as a large anthropoid, reacting with anger at Tintin's attempt to take Chang. As it lunges at Tintin, the flash bulb of Tintin's camera goes off, and <b>scares</b> <b>the</b> Yeti away. Chang tells Tintin that the Yeti saved his life after the crash. Upon returning to inhabited lands, the friends are surprised to be met by the Grand Abbot, who presents Tintin with a khata in honour of the bravery he has shown for his friend Chang.

5|$|Thalaba travels {{down into}} the cave and meets the warrior Othatha chained to rocks. Thalaba frees Othatha before {{travelling}} further until he meets an Efreet that guards a gate to the Domdaniel. After shooting an arrow into an eye of the Efreet, {{he is able to}} proceed forward where he meets Khawla and Mohareb. He is able to knock them away from him and quickly moves forward to find the powerful sword of his father. The sword of flames covers Thalaba in flames which causes the area to be filled with light. This <b>scares</b> <b>the</b> sorcerers who then try to attack him. After Thalaba defeats Mohareb and the sorcerers, the voice of Mohammad asks Thalaba what he wishes. Thalaba simply gives his will up to the Prophet before destroying an evil idol, which destroys the cave.|$|E
5|$|The film {{continues}} to be appreciated for its experimental nature, its camera angles and montage elements being treated in an unusual manner, while the fiction elements of the screenplay hint of magic realism. In this sense, {{it is important to}} mention that the days in the film are separated by Andrei's erotic dreams. In his dreams, the differences between him and Marilena are partially removed, either by lowering the rooftop on which the boy stands to ground level or by debarking the girl from a breast-shaped UFO that <b>scares</b> <b>the</b> neighbors away. Another fictional element is Marilena's capacity of provoking short circuits, in moments in which she is very emotionally active (e.g., when Andrei touches her in the bar's restroom, or when the whole neighborhood is cut from electricity when she cries near the high voltage electrical box).|$|E
5|$|Following this, Joan {{begins to}} gather troops {{and she takes}} her army to the forests around Orleans. While they camp there, a girl named Isabel comes and begins to {{describe}} the events surrounding siege of the city. Joan sends a messenger to offer the English peace, but the English decline. The French attack the English and, {{as soon as they}} start, a storm starts up and lightning flashes about them. This <b>scares</b> <b>the</b> English and Joan is able to win and enter the city. Soon after, Joan is able to lift the siege. The story continues with various French victories and the English are pushed back from fort after fort. Eventually, the English are pushed back to Tourelles. While the English fight their way there, one of the generals, Salisbury, is able to wound Joan. Her companion, Theodore, is able to kill Salisbury in return but he is brought down by the general Talbot. The French soon lay siege to Tourelles and begin a bloody fight to take the fort. During the battle, the French take many captives and the generals wish to execute them. However, Joan intervenes and ensures the safety of the captives' lives.|$|E

25|$|The {{southern}} house spider mating {{ritual is}} a lengthy (over an hour) and elaborate process with long periods during which neither the male nor the female moves considerably. When the wandering male encounters a female's web, {{there may be an}} initial confrontation where each <b>scares</b> <b>the</b> other. Upon recovering, the male then constructs a large web around the female's crevice. When this web is complete, the male pulls on its strands continuously to draw the female out of her hole, which may take several minutes. Following her emergence, each spider will tap at the other in an effort to grasp the other by the forelegs, with the male remaining suspended in his web.|$|E

Ripley <b>scares</b> <b>the</b> amateur thugs into dashing out of the apartment, and he single-handedly rescues the semi-conscious hostage.|$|E
500|$|Another {{scene in}} which Ottman meshed his editing and {{composing}} duties was when Dussander wakes {{up in the hospital}} with the television show The Jeffersons playing in the background. Ottman explained his intent for the scene, [...] "I used The Jeffersons as this innocuous thing—going between him and the television—so that when he does open his eyes, it <b>scares</b> <b>the</b> hell out of you... I added this deafening Bartok pizz, which is when all the violins pluck their strings really loud and they create this gnarly, unsettling sound." [...] Ottman recorded the film's score with the Seattle Symphony.|$|E

500|$|... "Blame It on the Alcohol" [...] is {{the fourteenth}} {{episode of the}} second season of the {{television}} series Glee, and the thirty-sixth overall. The episode was written by Ian Brennan, directed by Eric Stoltz and first aired in the United States on Fox on February 22, 2011. This episode mainly centers {{on the issues of}} underage drinking, as the students of McKinley High School are coming drunk to school in increasing numbers. Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) plans an assembly to warn the students about the dangers on underage drinking, and asks glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) to have his students perform a song that send positive messages about avoiding alcohol. Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) throws a party for the glee club students where almost everyone gets drunk; the partygoers wake up to hangovers, and must perform various songs about alcohol while still under the influence. The assembly ends abruptly when a song that seems to glorify alcohol is interrupted by two of the singers vomiting over the others, which <b>scares</b> <b>the</b> entire high school into avoiding drunkenness.|$|E
500|$|Hordern was a self-confessed [...] "lazy bugger" [...] {{when it came}} to role preparation. He did not regret {{his lack}} of formal acting training, and {{attributed}} his abilities to watching and learning from other actors and directors. He said: [...] "I am bored of the intellectual view of the theatre. Actually, it <b>scares</b> <b>the</b> shit out of me, my view being that an actor should learn the lines without too much cerebral interference." [...] In 1951, he asked Byam Shaw how best to rehearse unfamiliar roles. [...] The director advised him to [...] "never read up on them" [...] before going on to say [...] "read the plays as much as [...] but never read the commentators or critics". It was advice which Hordern adopted for the role of King Lear, {{and for the rest of}} his career. The critic Brian McFarlane, writing for the British Film Institute, said that Hordern, despite his relaxed attitude, [...] "had one of the most productive careers of any 20th century British actor".|$|E

500|$|In {{describing}} the character, Cooper said [...] "You don't {{know what he}} does {{in the depths of}} the evening, and he's gallivanting around." [...] He continued, [...] "I love dipping into ... some of that material of Howard Hughes, which I'm sure he's kind of been likened to", and described his biggest challenge in playing the character as [...] "keeping it very realistic, but at the same time, tongue-in-cheek as well", and not making Stark [...] "too broad". On Carter and Stark's relationship moving into the second season, Atwell said, [...] "there’s a new comfort level between Stark and Peggy ... they’re on a bit more of an even level. She respects him hugely, but is also not afraid to comment on his lifestyle choices and how disgustingly misogynistic she finds him ... he does use women as a form of escapism for him and his Dionysian ways, but when it comes to Peggy, he doesn’t see her as big boobs and red lips. He sees her as someone he can actually have a proper conversation with. Which probably <b>scares</b> <b>the</b> hell out of him".|$|E
500|$|Gillian Anderson {{described}} [...] "Sanguinarium" [...] as [...] "one of {{the most}} repulsive scripts I ever shot", explaining {{that she could not}} watch scenes such as the doctor stabbing a patient. David Duchovny stated that [...] "I didn't understand the plot, but I liked the script", noting that Carter and his team improved a weak teleplay and that director Kim Manners [...] "did an excellent job". Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Sanguinarium" [...] a [...] "B–", feeling that it was [...] "redeemed" [...] by the gore. However, they were [...] "worried" [...] by what they called the [...] "fourth consecutive phoned-in performance by Duchovny and Anderson". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was more negative, grading it a [...] "D". He felt that the episode was [...] "too much", and that the gore should have been suggested rather than shown directly. He also criticized the characterization of the characters (especially that of Scully), the [...] "predictable" [...] <b>scares,</b> <b>the</b> [...] "ludicrously bad" [...] dialogue, and a story that did not make much sense. Despite this, he did praise the [...] "strong" [...] guest acting. Sarah Stegall awarded [...] "Sanguinarium" [...] two stars out of five, and criticizing its reliance on gore. Ultimately, she found the conclusion wanting, because the [...] "good" [...] magic seemed useless; she wrote, [...] "Where's the logic in that?" [...] Ultimately, Stegall thought the episode's biggest flaw was its lack of logical writing, and that it required too much suspension of belief from the viewer.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity awarded the episode a [...] "C–" [...] grade. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it an 8 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, {{this was a}} very enjoyable and balanced episode. It gave us the <b>scares,</b> <b>the</b> humor, and the layered commentary that we had come to expect from the series. With only five episodes to go, it’s the perfect time for 1013 to be giving the series a good bit of resolution, even if it’s more metaphorical than actual." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two enjoyed Schnauz's script, calling it [...] "better than most" [...] of season nine's episodes, and noted that he wrote it with [...] "pace and wit". They noted, however, that the entry's self-references [...] "feel like carping [...] at the audience who are still left to complain." [...] Despite this, Shearman and Pearson also positively critiqued several of the episode's juxtapositions, such as the scene featuring Scully performing an autopsy on a cat while wearing a kitchen apron that says [...] "something smells goooood", calling them [...] "the funniest of the season". M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, called the episode a [...] "solid little entry", saying that it was a [...] "nice spin on the isolation stories that the series has always done so effectively".|$|E
