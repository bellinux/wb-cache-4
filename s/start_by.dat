30|$|We {{noticed that}} discussions <b>started</b> <b>by</b> {{well-known}} developers attract other well-known developers, more than discussions <b>started</b> <b>by</b> other people. Our interviewees {{reported that they}} would be more inclined to participate in a discussion <b>started</b> <b>by</b> known developers, as they already know their expertise.|$|R

5|$|For {{the second}} stage, the organisers {{had made the}} option to {{postpone}} the <b>start</b> <b>by</b> two hours, in case the mistral wind was making cycling difficult. This was not necessary, so the riders started at midnight as planned.|$|E
5|$|Male crickets {{establish}} their dominance {{over each other}} by aggression. They <b>start</b> <b>by</b> lashing each other with their antennae and flaring their mandibles. Unless one retreats at this stage, they resort to grappling, {{at the same time}} each emitting calls that are quite unlike those uttered in other circumstances. When one achieves dominance, it sings loudly, while the loser remains silent.|$|E
5|$|New rider Juan José Haedo {{gave the}} team a good <b>start</b> <b>by</b> winning early minor races. The {{classics}} season {{was a success}} by having O'Grady win Paris–Roubaix.

5|$|The first {{televised}} {{match was}} Razor Ramon versus Ted DiBiase. DiBiase {{got off to}} a quick <b>start</b> <b>by</b> attacking Ramon before the match began. Ramon quickly turned the match around with several clotheslines. DiBiase regained control before untying a turnbuckle cover. Ramon won the match after ramming DiBiase's head into the exposed turnbuckle and using the Razor's Edge to get the pin.|$|E

5|$|An outraged Licavoli has Greene's house blown up, but he survives. He then {{attempts}} to demote Nardi {{and take away}} his crew, {{only to have the}} latter join forces with Greene. Vowing to take over Cleveland together, Greene and Nardi <b>start</b> <b>by</b> organizing the murders of Licavoli’s associates, many of whom are blown up. Thirty-six car bombings occur during the summer of 1976, drawing national attention and humiliating Licavoli. After failing multiple times to kill Greene, Licavoli is forced to humbly ask Genovese boss Anthony Salerno to help him kill Nardi and Greene.|$|E
5|$|Gilroy {{spent several}} years trying to write a plot that would fit the setting, and experimented with conspiracies and murder mysteries as central story elements. Eventually, he decided to instead <b>start</b> <b>by</b> {{designing}} the characters, and attempted to create a standard literary hero character. Unable to create an interesting hero, he then envisioned an antihero as the lead character. Gilroy felt antiheros were a rarity in films, because they are difficult to write, and usually devolve into psychopaths; {{in an attempt to}} break from the stereotype, he thought of writing an antihero success story. Several films, including The King of Comedy (1983), To Die For (1995), and The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), were used as research on how to write antiheroes.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Metro {{undertook}} {{two steps}} to secure {{completion of the}} Green Line. First, the transit agency hired former U.S. Secretary of Transportation William T. Coleman, Jr. in December 1983 to oversee negotiations with the various entities involved with the siting of the Green Line route and seek a resolution through the U.S. district court. On February 21, 1984, Prince George's County Executive Parris Glendening announced that construction of the Green Line in Prince George's must <b>start</b> <b>by</b> September 30, 1984, or he would begin vetoing Metro spending proposals. At the same time, Metro and Coleman opened negotiations to build the Green Line from the L'Enfant Plaza Station to Anacostia. Advocates of the Rosecroft route, however, warned that they would sue if Metro switched {{back to the original}} route.|$|E
50|$|Criminal {{and civil}} {{procedure}} are different. Although some systems, including the English, allow {{a private citizen}} to bring a criminal prosecution against another citizen, criminal actions are nearly always <b>started</b> <b>by</b> the state.

5|$|In {{individual}} Olympic competition, Heath won {{a silver}} medal in the 200-meter freestyle (1:49.10) behind Gross's world record-setting performance (1:47.44). He also placed fourth in the 100-meter freestyle event final (50.41); the outcome was controversial, however, because of a premature starter gun and a quick <b>start</b> <b>by</b> Gaines, the winner. Gaines' coach, Richard Quick, knew of starter Frank Silvestri's propensity to fire the starter gun almost immediately when the swimmers mounted the blocks. Gaines gained about a meter's head start on the competition; video of the event later confirmed that {{one or more of}} the swimmers had not been set when the starter gun fired.|$|E
5|$|Kershaw rebounded {{his next}} <b>start</b> <b>by</b> {{pitching}} an 8 inning two-hitter and out-dueling the then undefeated Ubaldo Jiménez. He credited his {{control of the}} slider being the major turning point for him. Later in the season, he was suspended for five games after hitting Aaron Rowand of the Giants with a pitch in a game on July 20. The incident occurred after both teams were given a warning following Giants ace Tim Lincecum hitting Matt Kemp earlier in the game. He threw his first career complete game shutout on September 14, 2010 also against San Francisco and finished {{the season with a}} record of 13–10 and a 2.91 ERA in 32 starts, pitching 204 innings and recording 212 strikeouts.|$|E
5|$|Michigan's 541 yard {{offensive}} {{performance was}} the second straight week the offense gained more than 500 yards of offense, and {{was the second}} highest total of the season, only beaten by the previous week's total of 581 yards against Minnesota. Denard Robinson's 337 yards of passing were one yard shy of his career high; he threw for 338 yards against Notre Dame on Sept. 10, 2011. Michigan started a season 6–0 {{for the first time}} since 2006. Jordan Kovacs had two solo tackles for a loss, both on fourth down. Brady Hoke's 6–0 start was the first 6–0 <b>start</b> <b>by</b> a first-year Michigan coach since Bennie Oosterbaan did so in 1948.|$|E

5|$|Mosley {{was elected}} to his third term as {{president}} of the FIA in 2001. From 2000, Formula One saw the return of teams partly or wholly owned and operated by major motor manufacturers, who feared that under Ecclestone's management F1 coverage would go to pay television, reducing the value of their investment. In 2001, the Grand Prix Manufacturers Association (GPMA) announced an alternative world championship, the Grand Prix World Championship to <b>start</b> <b>by</b> 2008. The GPMA stipulated that the championship should not be regulated by the FIA, which Lovell believes was because the organisation believed Mosley was too close to Ecclestone. The proposed championship came to nothing and the GPMA later became the Formula One Teams Association (FOTA).|$|E
5|$|On May 24, 2008, the Dodgers bought Kershaw's minor-league contract, and he {{was added}} to the active roster. Sportswriter Tony Jackson called Kershaw's debut the most {{anticipated}} <b>start</b> <b>by</b> a Dodgers pitcher since Hideo Nomo's major league debut during the 1995 season. He made his debut on May 25, starting against the St. Louis Cardinals. He struck out the first batter he faced, Skip Schumaker, the first of seven strikeouts in the game, in which he pitched six innings and allowed two runs. When he debuted, Kershaw was the youngest player in MLB, a title he held for one full year.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer {{majored in}} chemistry, but Harvard {{required}} science students to also study history, literature, and philosophy or mathematics. He compensated for his late <b>start</b> <b>by</b> taking six courses each term and {{was admitted to}} the undergraduate honor society Phi Beta Kappa. In his first year, he was admitted to graduate standing in physics on the basis of independent study, which meant he was not required to take the basic classes and could enroll instead in advanced ones. He was attracted to experimental physics by a course on thermodynamics that was taught by Percy Bridgman. He graduated summa cum laude in three years.|$|E
