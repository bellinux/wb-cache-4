5|$|During World WarI, the palace, {{then the}} home of King GeorgeV and Queen Mary, escaped unscathed. Its more {{valuable}} contents were evacuated to Windsor but the royal family remained in situ. The King imposed rationing at the palace, much {{to the dismay of}} his guests and household. To the King's later regret, David Lloyd George persuaded him to go further by ostentatiously locking the wine cellars and refraining from alcohol, to <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> example to the supposedly inebriated working class. The workers continued to imbibe and the King was left unhappy at his enforced abstinence. In 1938, the north-west pavilion, designed by Nash as a conservatory, was converted into a swimming pool.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth was {{regarded}} by her contemporaries as an efficient but ruthless politician who used political intrigues {{to protect and}} defend her daughters' rights. She was a caring parent, but was neither politically talented nor competent to prepare Mary and Hedwig for their roles as monarchs. Elizabeth failed to <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> example for her daughters, and her unbalanced character and questionable methods in politics would serve more {{as a warning to}} the young sovereigns. Her procrastinations and inability to make clear decisions threatened Hedwig's status, while her endless problems with Croatian nobles and failure to improve relations with her native Bosnia made Mary's reign insecure and tumultuous.|$|E

The ACWF was responsible for publicizing the policy and its content, but questioned if the policy respected the rights of women. In the end, the ACWF settled on requesting that its cadres comply with the law to <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> example for the country, to promote the One-Child policy to the Chinese women, and to strongly condemn any coercive action related to the policy.|$|E

5|$|The first {{qualifying}} session began {{under the}} threat of rain, {{so most of the}} teams tried to <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> lap time before the conditions deteriorated. The Audis and Peugeots swapped the overall pole position several times, {{and at the end of}} the session the No. 1 Audi was fastest overall with a time of 3.28.301. The No. 33 Barazi-Epsilon Zytek led LMP2, after an earlier misfiring problem had been repaired. Oreca's Saleens were the fastest two GT1 cars, while Ferrari and Porsche were close to one another in GT2. The session was red flagged about halfway through because of an accident in which the No. 53 JLOC Lamborghini Murciélago, driven by Marco Apicella, hit the wall at the first Mulsanne chicane. The No. 25 Ray Mallock Ltd. Lola and No. 81 LNT Panoz were the only cars not to set a lap time before the session briefly returned to green as rain began. The ACO extended the session by fifteen minutes to compensate for the earlier red flag.|$|E

25|$|Paul Collingwood, Stuart Broad, Luke Wright, Alastair Cook and Kevin Pietersen all {{recovered}} from a stomach virus to start the match. Due to special regulations both teams consisted of 14 players with 11 of these players fielding/batting. England won the toss and chose to bat first and initially scored slowly with Mustard taking 15 balls {{to get off the}} mark. Cook and Bell established a strong partnership of 89 before Pietersen scored 50 from only 29 deliveries. Quick runs from Bopara and then Shah insured England <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> target of 314/4 with Bell scoring an unbeaten 131.|$|E
25|$|England started well {{getting the}} early wicket of Devon Smith {{in the third}} over, but a good {{partnership}} between Chris Gayle and Shivnarine Chanderpaul, producing a second-wicket partnership of 77 gave West Indies a strong platform. England then got two quick wickets of Chanderpaul and Samuels {{in the space of}} 15 deliveries to put the game in the balance. West Indies solidified their position, however, with Runako Morton and Chris Gayle putting on 85 for the fourth wicket. Quick batting from Dwayne Bravo (42 runs from 24 balls) ensured that the West Indies <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> score of 289/5 {{at the end of the}} innings and England needed 290 runs to win.|$|E

25|$|The fourth test saw a {{fighting}} spirit by the Aussies when they scored 262 but dismissed India for 272 and not letting them take a lead bigger than 10 runs. The {{first two days}} were filled with sledging by the Aussies. On day two, it was being said that the match was evenly poised but continuous collapse of Australia on day three did not enable them to <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> target despite a fifty by Peter Siddle in both the innings which created a record for half-centuries in both the innings of a test match by a number 9 batsman. India got a target of 155 and they achieved it easily {{on the same day}} with contribution from Kohli's 41, Dhoni's 12 not out and Pujara not out on 82. Dhoni hit the winning runs and India created history by winning four test matches in a series {{for the first time ever}} in their test history. Ravindra Jadeja was awarded the Man Of The Match award for his career best 5–58 and Ravichandran Ashwin was named the Man Of The Series for getting 29 wickets in four matches.|$|E

Kings XI Punjab got the tournament off to a flyer, winning all of their first 5 games. The stand out player was Glenn Maxwell with his unorthodox and powerful hitting, scoring 95, 89 and 95 in his first 3 innings with a strike rate of over 200.There were many inning building innings from the veteran Indian batsman Virender Sehwag and young star Manan Vohra which made middle order batting easy and qualify to the playoffs. Due to a brilliant 122 run knock from Virender Sehwag against Chennai Super Kings in the semifinal, KXIP {{make their way to}} the final. In the final, they faced Kolkata Knight Riders where they batted first and <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> target of 199 owing to Wriddhiman Saha's brilliant 115* (which incidentally was the first ton in an IPL final). However, due to Manish Pandey's 94 off 50 balls and his teammates consistently high run rate, including Piyush Chawla's 13 off 5 balls, KKR were able to win the final by 3 wickets in the final over of the match.|$|E
25|$|These divides {{can also}} occur {{between members of}} the same generation, {{particularly}} between older siblings who may identify more strongly with their home country and younger siblings who may identify more with American culture. This is especially likely to occur when older siblings belong to the 1.5 generation, meaning that they were born abroad, and younger siblings were born in the United States. In many societies, older siblings are given greater responsibilities and may feel more pressure from parents to <b>set</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> example for their younger siblings by performing well in school and obtaining success. At the same time, this greater responsibility often affords older siblings a greater degree of power within the family. Older siblings may therefore also be more likely to uphold their parents' traditional values because of the power it affords them within the family. In America's more egalitarian culture, power hierarchies based on age {{are less likely to be}} accepted. Younger siblings may therefore reject the authority of their older siblings, fostering tensions within the family. The migration process can therefore destabilize traditional power hierarchies within the family based on age and in some cases may lead to a reversal of such hierarchies. Regardless of whether tension exists among members of different generations or {{members of the same}} generation, degree of assimilation may pave the way for divisions within the family.|$|E
