Efforts were made to improve audibility of all sounds by means of spectral shaping. Additionally, participants performed tests measuring verbal working memory capacity, inhibition of interfering information in working memory, and linguistic closure. The results showed worse <b>speech</b> <b>reception</b> <b>thresholds</b> for <b>speech</b> masked by single-talker speech compared to fluctuating noise. In line with previous results for participants with normal hearing, the pupil response was larger when listening to speech masked by a single-talker compared to fluctuating noise.

Since {{there has not been}} a prospective randomized clinical trial study which compares the hearing result of total ossicular replacement prosthesis made of Titanium with omega connector and Polycel in the literature, we decided to perform a study encompassing this issue.   Materials and Methods: 105 patients, who were in the 2 nd stage of their operation and who needed total ossicular replacement prosthesis, were included in this prospective single blind randomized clinical trial study. Patients were classified in two groups: titanium Kurz (TTP™ -Vario system, Kurz GmbH, Dusslingen, Germany) with omega connector and Polycel (Sheehy Plastipore Polycel, Medtronic Xomed Inc). The duration of the follow up was 6 - 12 months. In order to evaluate hearing results, pure tone audiometric in 0. 5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz were checked. In addition, <b>speech</b> <b>reception</b> <b>threshold</b> was recorded. A successful surgery was defined as having a postoperative air–bone gap within 20 dB.   Results: We accomplished successful hearing in 64. 4 % of patients with titanium and 65 % of patients with a Polycel prosthesis. Improvement in <b>speech</b> <b>reception</b> <b>threshold</b> was 11. 5 dB in the titanium group and 13 dB in the Polycel group.

40|$|In the {{presence}} of competing speech or noise, reverberation degrades speech intelligibility not only by its direct effect on the target but also by affecting the interferer. Two experiments were designed to validate a method for predicting the loss of intelligibility associated with this latter effect. <b>Speech</b> <b>reception</b> <b>thresholds</b> were measured under headphones, using spatially separated target sentences and speech-shaped noise interferers simulated in virtual rooms. To investigate the effect of reverberation on the interferer unambiguously, the target was always anechoic. The interferer was placed in rooms with different sizes and absorptions, and at different distances and azimuths from the listener. The interaural coherence of the interferer did not fully predict the effect of reverberation. The azimuth separation of the sources and the coloration introduced by the room also {{had to be taken}} into account. The binaural effects were modeled by computing the binaural masking level differences in the studied configurations, the monaural effects were predicted from the excitation pattern of the noises, and speech intelligibility index weightings were applied to both.

40|$|The benefit {{provided}} to listeners with {{sensorineural hearing loss}} (SNHL) by an acoustic beamforming microphone array was determined in a speech-on-speech masking experiment. Normal-hearing controls were tested as well. For the SNHL listeners, prescription-determined gain {{was applied to the}} stimuli, and performance using the beamformer was compared with that obtained using bilateral amplification. The listener identified speech from a target talker located straight ahead (0 ° azimuth) in the presence of four competing talkers that were either colocated with, or spatially separated from, the target. The stimuli were spatialized using measured impulse responses and presented via earphones. In the spatially separated masker conditions, the four maskers were arranged symmetrically around the target at ± 15 ° and ± 30 ° or at ± 45 ° and ± 90 °. Results revealed that masked <b>speech</b> <b>reception</b> <b>thresholds</b> for spatially separated maskers were higher (poorer) on average for the SNHL than for the normal-hearing listeners. For most SNHL listeners in the wider masker separation condition, lower thresholds were obtained through the microphone array than through bilateral amplification.

40|$|The current {{experiment}} investigated whether better-ear glimpsing {{can explain}} the spatial release achieved by normal-hearing adults when situations are high in informational masking. Both modeling and behavioral methods were used. The <b>speech</b> <b>reception</b> <b>thresholds</b> of 38 young adults were measured for co-located, spatially separated and two better-ear glimpsed conditions. In the better-ear glimpsed conditions the binaural signals were processed so that in each time-frequency segment, the signal with the better SNR (left or right ear) was presented diotically. To investigate the effect of widening auditory filters on better-ear glimpsing, adjacent frequency bands were combined {{in one of the}} better-ear glimpsing conditions. Twenty-two participants were tested with maskers high in informational masking, while 16 participants were tested with maskers lower in informational masking. The mean <b>speech</b> <b>reception</b> <b>thresholds</b> achieved in the glimpsed conditions were significantly worse than in the spatially separated condition. This suggests that better-ear glimpsing can explain some but not all of the observed spatial release from masking. The difference between performance in the spatially separated and glimpsed conditions was largest when informational masking was high, suggesting better-ear glimpsing may release energetic rather than informational masking. Reducing the number of frequency bands sampled had a small effect on performance. 9 page(s...|$|R

Subsequently, the collection and verification of responses using a keyboard were examined.

An adaptive procedure was used to determine the spectral-ripple density that subjects could discriminate. A closed-set, forced-choice adaptive procedure was used to determine <b>speech</b> <b>reception</b> <b>thresholds</b> for words in two-talker babble and in speech-shaped, steady-state noise.

A significant correlation was also found between the spectral-ripple discrimination ability and word recognition in quiet (r[*]=[*] 0. 50, p[*]=[*] 0. 009). In addition, test–retest reliability for spectral-ripple discrimination was good, and no learning was observed.

40|$|For normal-hearing listeners, speech {{intelligibility}} improves if speech and noise are spatially separated. While this spatial release from masking {{has already been}} quantified in normal-hearing listeners in many studies, it is less clear how spatial release from masking changes in cochlear implant listeners with and without access to low-frequency acoustic hearing. Spatial release from masking depends on differences in access to speech cues due to hearing status and hearing device. To investigate the influence of these factors on {{speech intelligibility}}, the present study measured <b>speech</b> <b>reception</b> <b>thresholds</b> in spatially separated speech and noise for 10 different listener types. A vocoder was used to simulate cochlear implant processing and low-frequency filtering was used to simulate residual low-frequency hearing.

Simulated cochlear implant users with additional low-frequency acoustic hearing showed better speech intelligibility in noise than simulated cochlear implant users without acoustic hearing and had access to more spatial speech cues (e. g., higher binaural squelch). Cochlear implant listener types showed higher spatial release from masking with bilateral access to low-frequency acoustic hearing than without. A binaural speech intelligibility model with normal binaural processing showed overall good agreement with measured <b>speech</b> <b>reception</b> <b>thresholds,</b> spatial release from masking, and spatial speech cues.

In experiments 1 and 2, the performance intensity function and the <b>speech</b> <b>reception</b> <b>threshold</b> were measured for the speech in noise backgrounds which fluctuated on various time-scales. It was found that very rapid fluctuations in the masker {{had no effect on}} speech perception, whilst a masker containing fluctu ations of medium duration (80 to 100 's of millisec onds) provided a release from masking but did not affect the relative intelligibility of each consonant, nor the pattern of confusions.

In experiments 3 and 4, the effect on the <b>speech</b> <b>reception</b> <b>threshold</b> of varying the dura tion and magnitude of fluctuations was studied.
