500|$|In 1973 Peter Sellers {{introduced}} Harrison to Denis O'Brien. Soon after, the two {{went into}} business together. In 1978, {{in an effort}} to produce Monty Python's Life of Brian, they formed the film production and distribution company HandMade Films. Harrison explained: [...] "The name of the company came about as a bit of a joke. I'd been to Wooky Hole in Somerset... an old paper mill where they show you how to make old underpants into paper. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> a few rolls, and they had this watermark 'British Handmade Paper'... So we said... we'll call it Handmade Films." ...|$|E
2500|$|His next band, The Royal Pythons ("a gang {{that turned}} into a musical group"), was not a success either. Said DeVille: [...] "I {{decided to go to}} San Francisco; there was nothing really {{happening}} in New York. Flower power was dead. All the day-glo paint was peeling off the walls. People were shooting speed. I mean, it was real Night of the Living Dead. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> a truck and headed out west. I traveled all around the country for a couple of years, looking for musicians who had heart, instead of playing 20-minute guitar solos, which is pure ego." ...|$|E
2500|$|Foster cites his {{interest}} in bass guitar as coming from hearing Duane Eddy's song [...] "Rebel Rouser" [...] for the first time. [...] "A school friend played the 78 on his parents' big radiogram and it just filled the room with this powerful sound. It {{was one of those}} rare moments when your soul is touched and I realised that the deep sound behind Eddy's guitar came from something called a bass guitar, though I didn't see one until I watched Jet Harris on TV. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> an acoustic guitar for Â£2 and figured that I'd get that bass sound if I just tuned the strings down an octave, but of course it just made a pointless, flapping noise." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he answered. [...] "I {{am sorry}} {{that you were}} <b>so</b> unlucky. <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> these from the bank, Miss Clara, as I thought you would not feel {{comfortable}} {{if you had to}} leave Bristow owing this money to strangers." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{president}} of Remington shavers in 1978: [...] "When my wife {{bought me a}} Remington shaver, <b>I</b> was <b>so</b> impressed <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> the company".Victor Kiam would often appear in television advertisements for Remington shavers and say: [...] "Shaves as close as a blade, or your money back!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well {{the fact}} is, cousin,' said Mr. St. Clare, drawing her aside, 'she belonged {{to some people}} who were dreadfully cruel and beat her. I couldn't bear to hear her {{screaming}} every day, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> her. I will give her to you. Do try and make something of her.' ...|$|E
60|$|One can buy {{everything}} in Rimini, And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> the gaolers! when your father Heard {{that a man}} child had been born to him, His noble face lit up beneath his helm Like a great fire seen far out at sea, And taking my two hands, he bade me, Guido, To rear you worthy of him; so I have reared you To revenge his death upon the friend who sold him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Joost a {{pinch of}} snoof, sir. I heard feyther say as snoof would make dogs loose, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> a haporth and carried it in my pocket, for th' dogs don't moind oi when they are put oot. And then they gets horse oop and I makes 'em come back to t' lock-oop, but maister Johnson," [...] he said, looking reproachfully at the constable, [...] "wouldn't lock 'em oop as I wanted him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why didn't you say <b>so</b> before <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> the place, then? But it's not too late. I can {{be selling}} it and buying {{right here in}} East Grafton if that will please you--though there isn't half as nice a place to be had. But I'll fix it up somehow!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, Earnhardt's {{ownership}} of the EGR team was absorbed by Ganassi which reverted the name back to Chip Ganassi Racing. When Ganassi was asked why the team released her, he replied [...] "Teresa was a good partner but {{she was no longer}} there. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> just <b>bought</b> her share of the team and reverted the name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lesbia," [...] the Roman said, [...] "you complained, yesterday, {{that you}} had not enough slaves to keep the garden in proper order, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> have <b>bought</b> you two more from the slave market. They are Jews, that obstinate race that have been giving Titus so much trouble. Young as they are, {{they seem to have}} been fighting, for both of them are marked with several scars." ...|$|R
60|$|On further {{consideration}} this appeared so likely, that I abandoned my scheme, {{which had}} had a more promising appearance in words than in action; resolving henceforth {{to be satisfied with}} my child-wife, and to try to change her into nothing else by any process. I was heartily tired of being sagacious and prudent by myself, and of seeing my darling under restraint; <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> a pretty pair of ear-rings for her, and a collar for Jip, and went home one day to make myself agreeable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Still {{the matter}} {{did not end}} here, for next day the workmen said the {{accident}} was owing to the omission of a sacrifice at the commencement of the work, and they must have a lamb to kill on the ground, or more lives would certainly be lost. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> them a lamb, which they duly killed, cooked, and ate, after sprinkling its blood on {{the four corners of}} the foundation and on the walls. I had the skin of this lamb dressed and sent home as a curiosity." [...] See note 1.|$|E
6000|$|What I meant, was, that I {{would break}} {{one of his}} legs, or {{something}} of that sort; but in Lucerne I instantly saw that I could impair his mind. That would be more lasting, and more satisfactory every way. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> the cuckoo clock; and if I ever get home with it, he is [...] "my meat," [...] {{as they say in}} the mines. I thought of another candidate--a book-reviewer whom I could name if I wanted to--but after thinking it over, I didn't buy him a clock. I couldn't injure his mind.|$|E
60|$|CUSINS. It is true. You {{accused me}} yourself, Lady Brit, {{of joining the}} Army to worship Barbara; and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> did. She <b>bought</b> my soul like a flower at a street corner; but she bought it for herself.|$|R
5000|$|Remington Rand {{also made}} {{electric}} razors. The Remington brand of razor was originally {{produced by a}} division of Remington Rand, starting in 1937. Sperry Corporation sold the division in 1979 to Victor Kiam, who became the company spokesman of the new Remington Products Company. His line, [...] "I liked the shaver <b>so</b> much, <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> the company" [...] {{became one of the}} more memorable advertising slogans of the early 1980s. Remington Products was sold in 2003 to the battery manufacturer Rayovac. Rayovac is now Spectrum Brands.|$|R
60|$|Emp. Have I for this, ungrateful as thou art! When right, when nature, {{struggled}} in my heart; When heaven called {{on me for}} thy brother's claim, Broke all, and sullied my unspotted fame? Wert thou to empire, by my baseness, brought, And wouldst thou ravish what <b>so</b> dear <b>I</b> <b>bought?</b> Dear! for my conscience and its peace I gave;-- Why was my reason made my passion's slave? I see heaven's justice; thus the powers divine Pay crimes with crimes, and punish mine by thine.|$|R
60|$|To {{reach the}} stores where clothes could be bought, {{we had to}} pass a dozen saloons. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> me the drinks first. I never got to the {{clothing}} stores. In the morning, broke, poisoned, but contented, I came back on board, and we set sail. I possessed only the clothes I had gone ashore in, and not a cent remained of the one hundred and eighty dollars. It might well be deemed impossible, {{by those who have}} never tried it, that in twelve hours a lad can spend all of one hundred and eighty dollars for drinks. I know otherwise.|$|E
60|$|The ruins are {{extensive}} and very interesting; but I have put off describing them too long, and cannot make a distinct picture of them now. Moreover, except to a spectator skilled in architecture, all ruined abbeys {{are pretty much}} alike. As we came away, we noticed some women making baskets at the entrance, {{and one of them}} urged us to buy some of her handiwork; for that she was the gypsy of Netley Abbey, and had lived among the ruins these thirty years. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> one for a shilling. She was a woman with a prominent nose, and weather-tanned, but not very picturesque or striking.|$|E
60|$|Claire, darling, {{you must}} come. I'm wretched. Algie has got my goat the worst way. If you don't {{know what that}} means it means that he's {{behaving}} like a perfect pig. I hardly know where to begin. Well, it was this way: directly I made my hit my press agent, a real bright man named Sherriff, got busy, of course. Interviews, you know, and Advice to Young Girls in the evening papers, and How I preserve my beauty, and all that sort of thing. Well, one thing he made me do was to buy a snake and a monkey. Roscoe Sherriff is crazy about animals as aids to advertisement. He says an animal story is the thing he does best. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> them.|$|E
5000|$|Matador {{acquired}} True Panther Sounds as {{an imprint}} in 2009. Cosloy, speaking through the Matador blog, stated that True Panther Sounds [...] "will {{continue to be}} managed by label founder Dean Bein." [...] And that the reason Matador acquired True Panther Sounds was simply, [...] "As Victor Kiam once explained his decision to purchase the Remington Shaver operation, âI liked it <b>so</b> much, <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> the company.â The first joint venture by the two labels was Girlsâ debut critically acclaimed release âAlbumâ and was [...] "worked through Matadorâs fearsome promotional & marketing machinery" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now will I {{deal with}} the Fox and the Bear. It seems they have cast eyes upon the maiden. <b>So?</b> Behold, <b>I</b> have <b>bought</b> her! Thling-Tinneh leans upon the rifle; the goods of {{purchase}} are by his fire. Yet will I be fair to the young men. To the Fox, whose tongue is dry with many words, will I give of tobacco five long plugs.|$|R
5000|$|After {{attending}} Yale, the Sorbonne, and Harvard Business School, Kiam {{worked for}} Lever Brothers and Playtex as a salesman. He bought the Benrus Watch Company in 1968, selling his majority stake in 1977. He {{made a fortune}} as the President and CEO of Remington Products, which he famously purchased in 1979 after his wife bought him his first electric shaver. Kiam became famous as {{the spokesman for the}} Remington shaver. His catchphrase, [...] "I liked the shaver <b>so</b> much, <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> the company", made him a household name. [...] He recorded each commercial in the native language of the country in which it was broadcast. In Britain he became a celebrity, appearing on TV chat shows, including 'Wogan', 'The Tube', and David Frost's 'Through the Keyhole'. He also operated other companies, including Ronson and TravelSmart.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{made the}} mine worth money. I {{discovered}} the secret, {{it was my}} invention. I paid you four times what you had put into it. The mine was worthless until I invented a process for saving the gold. I claimed it as an invention like any man claims a patent right. I believed I {{had a right to}} it--to all of it, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> in your stock after I had solved the problem of the reduction. I say I believed I was right--to-night I believe I was wrong--it don't matter how I came to the conclusion, but I've changed my mind. I have come to-night to make restitution. I am ready to pay you ninety cents more on every dollar of stock you sold me at that time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I thought {{over the}} matter all day, and by evening I was in low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself {{that the whole}} affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be I could not imagine. It seemed {{altogether}} past belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica.' Vincent Spaulding did what he could to cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing. However, in the morning I determined {{to have a look}} at it anyhow, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> a penny bottle of ink, and with a quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for Pope's Court.|$|E
6000|$|They had a {{table at}} the front of the restaurant, near the violin. They glowed over soup and real meat and coffee. There were funny people at the next table--a man who made jokes. Something about the [...] "Yiddisher gavotte," [...] and saying, [...] "We been going to dances a lot, but last night the wife and I wanted to be quiet, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> me two front seats for Grant's Tomb!" [...] It was tremendous. Father and Mother couldn't make many jokes, these days, but they listened and laughed. The waiter remembered them; they had always tipped him ten cents; he kept coming back to see if there was {{anything}} they wanted, as though they were important people. Father thanked her for the overcoat in what he blithely declared to be Cape Cod dialect, and toasted her in coffee. They were crammed with good cheer when Mother paid the check from a dollar she had left over, and they rose from the table.|$|E
6000|$|... "And if I had a fortune, I'm {{pretty sure}} I should spend {{a good deal}} of it in this way," [...] said Pheasant. [...] "I can imagine such {{completeness}} of toilet as I have never seen. How I would like the means to show what I could do! My life, now, is perpetual disquiet. I always feel shabby. My things must all be bought at haphazard, as they can be got out of my poor little allowance,--and things are getting so horridly dear! Only think of it, girls! gloves at two and a quarter! and boots at seven, eight, and ten dollars! and then, as you say, the fashions changing <b>so!</b> Why, <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> a sack last fall and gave forty dollars for it, and this winter I'm wearing it, to be sure, but it has no style at all,--looks quite antiquated!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1893, {{the island}} was sold for a dollar an acre by a banker named Keith, and was later bought in the late 1960s by a {{developer}} named Phil Matty. [...] "No utilities, no garbage trucks, no telephones, no fire stations, no policemen, no industryâjust 32 acres of beautiful British Columbia. I escaped to that paradise {{for a few hours}} each week to move rocks, saw logs, watch the tide come in and go outâall in the name of therapeutic basket weaving. It was like having my own personal psychiatrist. I loved it. <b>I</b> loved it <b>so</b> much that <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> it." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>bought</b> a banjo, and I didn't {{like the}} dots on the neck. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> took the neck off, {{and at the}} same time I heard a drummer called Chico Hamilton, who played with Gerry Mulligan, and I wanted to play like that, with brushes. I didn't have a snare drum, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> put the banjo head on a stand.|$|R

6000|$|... 29. Morning. If {{this be a}} fine day, I {{will walk}} into the City, and see Charles Barnard's library. What care I for your letter, saucy N.12? I will say nothing to it yet: faith, I believe this will be full before its time, and then go it must. I will always write once a fortnight; and if it goes sooner by filling sooner, why, then {{there is so much}} clear gain. Morrow, morrow, rogues and lasses both, I can't lie {{scribbling}} here in bed for your play; I must rise, and so morrow again.--At night. Your friend Montgomery and his sister are here, as I am told by Patrick. I have seen him often, but take no notice of him: he is grown very ugly and pimpled. They tell me he is a gamester, and wins money.--How could I help it, pray? Patrick snuffed the candle too short, and the grease ran down upon the paper.(13) It an't my fault, 'tis Patrick's fault; pray now don't blame Presto. I walked today in the City, and dined at a private house, and went to see the auction of poor Charles Barnard's books; they {{were in the middle of}} the physic books, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> none; and they are so dear, I believe I shall buy none, and there is an end; and go to Stoyte's, and I'll go sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "Even <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> {{the poor}} fellow when a mere child from a Dutch skipper {{who had used}} him scurvily, and he has grown up as {{faithful}} as a very spaniel, and mightily useful too, not only as body servant, but he can cook {{as well as any}} French maitre d'hotel, froth chocolate, and make the best coffee I ever tasted; is as honest as the day, and, I believe, would lay down his life for Peregrine or me. I shall be cruelly at a loss without him, but a physician I met in London tells me it would be no better than murder to take the poor rogue to so cold a country as Muscovy. I would leave him to wait on Perry, but they will not hear of it at Oakwood. My sister- in-law wellnigh had a fit every time she looked at him when I was there before, and I found, moreover, that even when I was at hand, the servants jeered at the poor blackamoor, gave him his meals apart, and only the refuse of their own, so that he would fare but ill if I left him to their mercy. I had thought of offering him to Mr. Evelyn of Says Court, who would no doubt use him well, but it was Peregrine who suggested that if you of your goodness would receive the poor fellow, they could sometimes meet, and that would cheer his heart, and he really is far from a useless knave, but is worth two of any serving-men I ever saw." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{shall not}} forget that drive. It was {{doubtful}} weather, even in a motor-cab, the thing was possible with any consideration for the driver, {{not to speak of}} some slight consideration for the people in the road. I urged the driver to eat and drink something before he started, but he said (with I know not what pride of profession or delicate sense of adventure) that he would rather do it when we arrived--if we ever did. I was by no means <b>so</b> delicate; <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> a varied selection of pork-pies at a little shop that was open (why was that shop open?--it is all a mystery), and ate them as we went along. The beginning was sombre and irritating. I was annoyed, not with people, but with things, like a baby; with the motor for breaking down and with Sunday for being Sunday. And the sight of the northern slums expanded and ennobled, but did not decrease, my gloom: Whitechapel has an Oriental gaudiness in its squalor; Battersea and Camberwell have an indescribable bustle of democracy; but the poor parts of North London... well, perhaps I saw them wrongly under that ashen morning and on that foolish errand.|$|R
50|$|About {{five years}} ago, I {{tried to make}} my life as {{complicated}} as possible. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> started this restaurant, and I started this Little Idiot illustratorsâ collective, and I started a bottled beverage company, and <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> this piece of property upstate.

To make matters worse, you fainted. I tried two hotels but they refused to take you in; they were {{probably}} afraid {{that you were going}} to be ill. Then I thought of this room. I am employed, as you know, by a firm of estate agents. I do a great deal of work on my own account, however, which I prefer to do in secret, and unknown to any one. For that reason, I hired this room a year ago and I come here most evenings to work. Sometimes <b>I</b> stay late, <b>so</b> last month <b>I</b> <b>bought</b> a small bedstead and had it fixed up here. There is a woman who comes in to clean the room. I went to her house last night and persuaded her to come here. She undressed you and put you to bed.
