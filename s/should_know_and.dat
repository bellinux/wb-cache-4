5|$|At {{the back}} of Why Johnny Can't Read, Flesch had {{included}} 72 lists of words that young children {{should be able to}} read, and Spaulding provided Geisel with a similar list. Geisel later told biographers Judith and Neil Morgan that Spaulding had supplied him with a list of 348 words that every six-year-old <b>should</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> insisted that the book's vocabulary be limited to 225 words. However, according to Philip Nel, Geisel gave varying numbers in interviews from 1964 to 1969. He variously claimed that he could use between 200 and 250 words from a list of between 300 and 400; the finished book contains 236 different words.|$|E
25|$|With the {{adoption}} of standards-based education, most states have created examinations in which students are compared to a standard of what educators, businesspeople, parents, and other stakeholders have determined to be what every student <b>should</b> <b>know</b> <b>and</b> be able to do. Students are graded as exceeding, meeting, or falling below the standard. The advantage is that students are not compared against each other, and all {{have the opportunity to}} pass the standard. However, the standard is typically set at a level that is substantially higher than previous achievement, so that a relatively high percentage of students fail at least some part of the standards in the first year, including an especially high percentage non-college bound students.|$|E

25|$|A 2012 review found {{a number}} of adverse events were {{reported}} after acupuncture in the UK's National Health Service (NHS) but most (95%) were not severe, though miscategorization and under-reporting may alter the total figures. From January 2009 to December 2011, 468 safety incidents were recognized within the NHS organizations. The adverse events recorded included retained needles (31%), dizziness (30%), loss of consciousness/unresponsive (19%), falls (4%), bruising or soreness at needle site (2%), pneumothorax (1%) and other adverse side effects (12%). Acupuncture practitioners <b>should</b> <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> be prepared to be responsible for, any substantial harm from treatments. Some acupuncture proponents argue that {{the long history of}} acupuncture suggests it is safe. However, there is an increasing literature on adverse events (e.g. spinal-cord injury).|$|E
