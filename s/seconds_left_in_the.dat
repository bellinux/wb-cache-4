In the second quarter, Clemson quarterback Don King was sacked by several Maryland defenders and suffered a game-ending knee injury. With 45 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> half, Dick Nolan scored on a 90-yard punt return. In the second half, Faloney connected with Nolan for a 65-yard touchdown pass.

5|$|During the February 21, 2000 {{game between}} the Canucks and the Boston Bruins, Brashear was {{involved}} in a fight with Marty McSorley. Brashear handily won the fight and {{on his way to the}} penalty box taunted the Bruins bench. Later in the game, Brashear collided with Bruins goaltender Byron Dafoe, who had to be taken off on a stretcher with a knee injury. For the rest of the game, McSorley attempted to fight Brashear, who refused. With 4.6 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game, McSorley struck Brashear with a two-handed slash to the temple with his stick; Brashear collapsed, and his helmet fell off upon impact. He suffered a seizure on the ice and the slash resulted in a grade three concussion. Goaltender Garth Snow then tried to fight McSorley, but a pile-up occurred, and Snow couldn't get at McSorley, who was ejected with 2.8 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game. McSorley later received an indefinite suspension from the NHL and was charged with assault with a weapon as a result of his actions.|$|E

The event quickly turned into an international incident, with officials, politicians and public opinion from Chinese Taipei, China and South Korea trading accusations of manipulation and fraud.|$|E
5|$|Statistically, the Bears offense struggled. Cutler {{completed}} 27 of 47 {{passes for}} 317 yards, two touchdowns, three interceptions and a 65.6 passer rating. Cutler's three interceptions and fumble tied his turnover amount {{in the first}} three games. The offense also had trouble on third down; despite being ranked ninth in third down efficiency, the Bears failed to convert until there were 47 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game to end the game converting just 1 of 13 third downs.|$|E

5|$|The NHL became first {{involved}} in international {{play in the}} mid-1970s, starting with the Summit Series in 1972 which pitted the top Canadian players of the NHL against the top players in the Soviet Union. With the eight-game series tied at three wins apiece and a tie, Paul Henderson scooped up a rebound and put it past Soviet goaltender Vladislav Tretiak with 34 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eighth and final game to score the series-winning goal.|$|E
5|$|The first-round {{series against}} the Rockets was a tight one, with three of the six games going to overtime. The Blazers fared well {{in the first two}} games despite not having home-court advantage, beating Houston 122-120 and 112-105 in Games 1 and 2 respectively, fueled by Aldridge's 46 points and 18 rebounds in Game 1, and 43 points and 3 blocks in Game 2. In the sixth game of the series with the Rockets {{threatening}} to force a Game 7 back in Houston, down by two points with 0.9 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game, Damian Lillard hit a buzzer-beating three-pointer to close out the series, and the Blazers advanced to the semifinals for the first time since 2000, where they lost to the eventual champion San Antonio Spurs in five games.|$|E
5|$|Trinidad {{traveled}} to San Diego, California and defeated the IBF welterweight champion Maurice Blocker in two rounds, {{in a fight}} card that took place on June 19, 1993, televised by Showtime. Trinidad spent the first two minutes of the fight analyzing Blocker's style. With 11 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first round, one of Trinidad's punches injured Blocker, who barely survived the round. In the second round, the champion's condition appeared to improve, but after the first 30 seconds, another Trinidad punch injured him. Trinidad followed with a combination, scoring a knockout at 1:49 in the round when the referee stopped the fight. Afterwards, tournament organizer Don King's exclusive relationship to stage fights for the cable channel Showtime meant that Trinidad would be showcased regularly on Showtime Championship Boxing.|$|E

5|$|After Navy forced North Texas {{to begin}} the second quarter with a punt, Midshipmen running back Eric Kettani fumbled {{the ball on the}} second play of the next drive and the Mean Green recovered. The next eight {{possessions}} – four from each team – resulted in touchdowns. Four of the drives took less than a minute of game time to reach the end zone, and a fifth took barely over a minute. In the final two minutes of the half the Midshipmen forced the Mean Green to punt after three plays, and Navy quarterback Kaipo-Noa Kaheaku-Enhada threw a 47-yard pass to running back Reggie Campbell. The Midshipmen ran for another touchdown on the next play. North Texas got the ball back with seven <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> half, but chose not to attempt to score again. At {{the end of the first}} half, the Mean Green led the Midshipmen 49–45.|$|E
5|$|Despite Toronto's {{improved}} defensive performances, Carter's offence was sorely {{missed in}} the first-round {{series against the}} second-seeded Detroit Pistons. In the first game, Detroit overwhelmed Toronto 83–65, largely due to Ben Wallace's strong performance of 19 points, 20 rebounds, 3 blocks and 3 steals. Detroit also won Game 2, but Toronto won the next two games at home to force a deciding and tightly contested Game 5 in Detroit. With 10.7 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game, and the Raptors down 85–82 with possession of the ball, Childs raced down the court and shot a three-pointer that missed badly, apparently trying to draw a foul on the play, instead of passing to a wide-open Curry. In a post-game locker room interview, Childs repeatedly insisted that the Raptors had been down four points, not three. The Raptors' late-season surge was thus marred by a disappointing playoff exit; the Olajuwon experiment was also a bust, with the 39-year-old averaging career lows in minutes, points and rebounds. Furthermore, Childs, Clark and Curry left the team, ensuring a new-look team for the next season.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the absence}} of Bertuzzi for the {{remainder}} of the season, Näslund led the Canucks to the Northwest Division title they had lost the previous season. Bertuzzi was replaced on the top line by Matt Cooke. The Canucks' division title placed them third in the Western Conference standings, matching them against the sixth-placed Calgary Flames in the opening round of the 2004 playoffs. In the seventh and deciding game of the series between the two teams, the Canucks faced a one-goal deficit in the final minute of regulation time. With the Canucks having pulled their goaltender for an extra attacker, Näslund stickhandled the length of the ice past two defenders, before shooting the puck on goal. Calgary goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff saved the shot before Cooke scored on the rebound with six <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game. Despite the effort, Calgary subsequently eliminated Vancouver a minute-and-a-half into the subsequent overtime period on a powerplay goal. Näslund finished the playoffs with nine points in seven games.|$|E

She also participated in five game test series against the Netherlands, the United States and Japan where her team won all games in those series. In the team's 52–50 win over Canada in one of those games, she scored a layup with 16 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> match that brought the score to 51–50.|$|E
5|$|In Michigan's {{next game}} against Notre Dame, Robinson {{completed}} 11 of 24 passes for 338 yards with four touchdowns and had 108 yards rushing on 16 carries with a touchdown on a recovered fumble near the goal line. He threw the game-winning {{touchdown pass to}} Roy Roundtree with two <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth quarter to defeat the Irish 35–31. The performance moved Robinson into third place in Big Ten history for rushing yards by a quarterback. In recognition of his performance during the game, the Big Ten named Denard Robinson its Offensive Player of the Week, while the Davey O'Brien Award named him its Quarterback of the Week. He was also named Rivals.com's Big Ten and National Player of the Week and was nominated for the Capital One Cup Impact Performance of the Week, which he won by fan vote.|$|E

5|$|Temple Owls' {{season ended}} on March 19 with a 71–64 loss to second-seeded San Diego State in double overtime. The Aztecs took an 11-point {{lead in the}} first half, but Temple Owls recovered. Off a turnover, Lavoy Allen made a seven-footer {{to tie the game}} at 54 with 51 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half.

At the beginning of the first overtime period, Juan Fernandez hit a three-pointer to give the Owls a 57–54 lead. Malcolm Thomas responded with a three-point play to tie the game at 61. Thomas could not hit a shot and the game went into a second overtime.

Ramone Moore had 17 points, and Allen had 12 points and 11 rebounds in his final game as a Temple Owl.|$|E
5|$|The Hurricanes {{picked up}} a first down on one rush each from Hobbs and Roan, but were unable to gain another. After a Miami punt, Tech {{returned}} to offense from its 46-yard line. Casey {{picked up a}} first down on a pass, then gained another after a seven-yard scramble that followed a three-yard rush by Lawrence. Lawrence then gained a first down on his own after rushing for nine yards and five yards, driving the Hokies to the Miami 15-yard line in the process. After entering the Miami red zone, however, Tech was unable to gain a first down and Casey was sacked for a loss of 13 yards. Facing a fourth down and needing 20 yards for a first down, Tech coach Bill Dooley sent in kicker Dennis Laury to attempt a 42-yard field goal. The kick was successful, and with 29 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first half, Tech cut Miami's lead to 143.|$|E
