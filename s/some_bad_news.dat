25|$|The Dodgers {{traveled}} to Pittsburgh on June 24 {{to open a}} four-game series against the Pirates at PNC Park. Nick Tepesch was promoted from AAA to make a spot start and he allowed five runs on seven hits in only four innings to put the team in a hole they never recovered from. Corey Seager had four hits in the game but the Dodgers lost 8–6. Kershaw allowed four runs in a game {{for the first time}} all season as his 10 start unbeaten streak came to an end with a 4–3 loss to the Pirates on June 26. In the final game of the series, the Pirates jumped out to a four run lead in the first inning but the Dodgers came from behind to win 5–4 to avoid the sweep. Urías picked up his first major league win on June 28 with a 6–5 victory over the Brewers at Miller Park. Junior Guerra shut down the Dodgers bats the next say as rookie Brock Stewart had a rough debut, allowing five runs in the second inning as the Dodgers lost 7–0. The Dodgers received <b>some</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> as the month ended, with Kershaw heading to the disabled list due to a herniated disc in his back. Meanwhile, the team won the final game of the month, 8–1. Maeda allowed only one run on three hits in six innings and the Dodgers hit three home runs.|$|E

I felt utterly devastated, and knew I would never play for England again, which had been my main motivating force. So when the Today newspaper offered me the post of cricket correspondent the following summer, it was an easy decision to make. I might have been only thirty, which was no age to retire from professional cricket, and I could easily have played for another five years. But it was definitely time to move on." ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, Memorial Stadium was in serious disrepair. The stadium's seating and {{restroom}} facilities were not ADA-compliant, the sidewalk {{on the eastern}} side of the stadium and the concrete steps in the east side bleachers were crumbling from over-use, poor drainage had damaged the foundation of the east side bleachers so much that their structural integrity was at risk, concession areas were too small, and the meeting rooms for home and visitor football teams were plagued by small size as well as humidity, mold, and general disrepair from overuse. The cost of creating ADA-compliant facilities, fixing the drainage problem, and rebuilding the steps was estimated at $500,000. Complete reconstruction of the eastern bleachers, along with improvements to concessions and team meeting spaces, was set at $2 million. Despite the expense, the rebuild option had the advantage of widening the running track around the field. [...] This would permit the track to expand from its current six lanes to 10 lanes (allowing the stadium to host the state track meet), and would also permit widening of the grass field to permit soccer games. A committee of school board members and public citizens studied the issue, and recommended in November 1999 that $475,000 be spent to improve the drainage, fix the east sidewalk, make ADA-required improvements, and upgrade the team meeting room buildings. But the committee reported <b>some</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> as well. It discovered that the running track also needed to be replaced (at a cost of $400,000) because drainage problems and substrata settling had caused portions of the track to buckle and the latex surface to separate from its asphalt base. The committee suggested spending up to $250,000 for a new high-tech surface (rather than replace the existing latex one). Finally, the committee suggested spending $235,000 to improve exit stairs, upgrade and expand bathrooms in the west grandstand, widen aisles in the west grandstand, replace railings in the west grandstand, and replace benches and chairs throughout the stadium with aluminum seating. Some committee members suggested replacing the east bleachers entirely at a cost of $1.8 million to allow for track expansion, and argued the city should seek a private donor or corporate sponsorship of the stadium to pay for the cost. The school board was not receptive to this latter idea, but agreed to endorse an effort by a group of private citizens to try to raise the required $2.2 million total.|$|E

They find that, in contrast to standard signaling models, an action {{is good news for}} <b>some</b> firms and <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> for others, depending on observable characteristics of the firm, its managers, and their compensation plans. Further, voluntary trade eliminates separating equilibria and, thus, the possibility of exactly inferring the manager's private information.

Such undesirable behavior can be more effectively constrained by compensation contracts based on phantom shares or nontradeable options instead of large stockholdings.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{disclosure of}} 250 profit forecasts in 701 UK takeover bids {{in the period}} 1988 to 1992 against five research issues: - Factors influencing disclosure of forecasts - Influence of prevailing market expectations - Effect of disclosure of forecasts {{on the outcome of}} bids - Factors influencing disclosure content in forecasts - Whether forecasts disclosed convey good news Logit analysis and negative binomial regression are the two primary statistical techniques used to analyse the results. Results show the domination of the takeover-context of the research. Two variables accounted for almost all the influence on disclosure of forecasts for both bidders and targets: bid horizon and type of bid. Probability of disclosure of a forecast is greater the shorter the bid horizon and during contested bids. In addition to bid horizon and type of bid, for bidders, year, value of bid and purchase consideration were significant, and for targets value of bid and industry were significant in one of the two models estimated. Evidence supporting the hypothesis that forecast disclosure is more likely when market expectations are out of line with actual results is provided. There is some evidence that forecasts by targets affect the outcome of bids, but there is no such evidence for bidders. Takeover-context variables and forecast-related variables were most relevant in determining disclosures in forecasts. Disclosure content in forecasts was significantly greater during contested bids, in voluntary forecasts and in longer period forecasts. Significantly more assumptions were disclosed by target forecasters and in longer horizon forecasts. Evidence shows a tendency to disclose good news, with <b>some</b> disclosure of <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> Good news forecasts are more likely during contested bids. Targets are more likely to disclose <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> forecasts, but when bidders disclose <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> it tends to be worse on average than targets' <b>bad</b> <b>news...</b>|$|R

Anxiety was shown to moderate the breaking of <b>bad</b> <b>news,</b> with more anxious respondents being more reluctant, due to their concern for self/other and norms. Half the sample broke <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> at least monthly, indicated that they break diverse types of <b>bad</b> <b>news,</b> and that they received little training in breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> Psychologists also indicated that breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> was an important skill to have and a need for training in this area. ^ The qualitative portion of the study examined the reluctancy of respondents in more detail. Reluctant respondents most frequently cited concern for self/others, context, and norms as the reasons. In contrast, respondents who were not reluctant to break <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> most frequently cited their concern for the recipient and experience as reasons.
