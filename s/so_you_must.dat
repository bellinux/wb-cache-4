2500|$|Japanese dialects show {{regional}} variations between using baka in Kantō dialect and ahō 阿呆 or あほ [...] "fool; idiot; jackass" [...] in Kansai dialect. In addition, {{the insult}} ahō {{has more of}} a slang connotation than baka. Many Japanese dictionaries treat the words baka and ahō as synonyms. [...] "However, in Osaka and its surroundings, aho is a rather non-offensive word, whereas baka is an explosive word." [...] Nevertheless, [...] "In Tokyo and its surroundings, we find exactly the opposite, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> be careful with the usage of these words." ...|$|E
2500|$|Betza {{also created}} a second 16×16 variant, which he termed Golden Age Chess on a Really Big Board. He wrote: [...] "This game is {{designed}} to create an open position in which development, initiative, and attack are all-important, the positions are too complex to calculate <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> play by intuition, and you never count Pawns -- in other words, {{a return to the}} Golden Age!" [...] However, he appears to have considered Chess on a Really Big Board to be the primary 16×16 game, that could be translated to 3D to make 16×16×16 chess.|$|E
2500|$|Jimmy Manyi, ANC {{director}} general of labour and later ANC spokesperson, is quotes as saying the following on a TV interview: “I think its very important for coloured {{people in this country}} to understand that South Africa belongs to them in totality, not just the Western Cape. So this over-concentration of coloureds in the Western Cape is not working for them. They should spread {{in the rest of the}} country ... so they must stop this over-concentration situation because they are in over-supply where they are <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> look into the country and see where you can meet the supply." [...] No action has been taken against Manyi.|$|E

2500|$|This {{difference}} between following either the Ahl al-Bayt (Muhammad's family and descendants) or Caliph Abu Bakr has shaped Shia and non-Shia views {{on some of}} the Quranic verses, the hadith (narrations from Muhammad) and other areas of Islam. For instance, the collection of hadith venerated by Shia Muslims is centered on narrations by members of the Ahl al-Bayt and their supporters, while some hadith by narrators not belonging to or supporting the Ahl al-Bayt are not included. Those of Abu Hurairah, for example, Ibn Asakir in his Ta'rikh Kabir and Muttaqi in his Kanzu'l-Umma report that Caliph Umar lashed him, rebuked him and forbade him to narrate hadith from Muhammad. Umar said: [...] "Because you narrate hadith in large numbers from the Holy Prophet, you are fit only for attributing lies to him. (That is, one expects a wicked man like you to utter only lies about the Holy Prophet.) <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>must</b> stop narrating hadith from the Prophet; otherwise, I will send you to the land of Dus." [...] (A clan in Yemen, to which Abu Huraira belonged.) According to Sunnis, Ali was the fourth successor to Abu Bakr, while the Shia maintain that Ali was the first divinely sanctioned [...] "Imam", or successor of Muhammad. The seminal event in Shia history is the martyrdom in 680 CE at the Battle of Karbala of Ali's son Hussein ibn Ali, who led a non-allegiance movement against the defiant caliph (71 of Hussein's followers were killed as well). Hussein came to symbolize resistance to tyranny.|$|E
