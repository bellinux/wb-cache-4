5|$|In 1370 the French made a {{successful}} attack on Portsmouth, commencing a new sequence of raids along the English coast. In due course first Edward, then Richard II, responded by improving the defences {{in the south}} of England. Part of this involved improving the condition of Southampton Castle, where, owing in part to the theft of building materials, including stone and lead, by the citizens of the town, the defences were in a poor condition. Henry Yevele, who oversaw the improvements to the castle, probably also constructed the Arcades along the western walls in 1380: this involved adopting the 1360 proposal to block up the properties along the western quay to form a <b>solid</b> <b>wall,</b> and adding three towers and gunports. Sir John Sondes and John Polymond were appointed by the king in 1386 to further improve the town walls, working with Sir John Arundel, the castle governor – Polymond and Arundel Towers were probably named after these men around this time.|$|E

25|$|Bramante's {{plan for}} the dome of St. Peter's (1506) follows that of the Pantheon very closely, and {{like that of the}} Pantheon, was {{designed}} to be constructed in Tufa Concrete for which he had rediscovered a formula. With the exception of the lantern that surmounts it, the profile is very similar, except that in this case the supporting wall becomes a drum raised high above ground level on four massive piers. The <b>solid</b> <b>wall,</b> as used at the Pantheon, is lightened at St. Peter's by Bramante piercing it with windows and encircling it with a peristyle.|$|E

MCA, being the industry leader at the time was his first choice of labels.

25|$|Moisture may ascend into a {{building}} from {{the foundation of a}} wall or gain ingress into {{a building}} from a wet patch of ground, where it meets a <b>solid</b> <b>wall.</b> The manifest result of this process is called damp. One of many methods of resisting such ingresses of water is to construct the wall with several low courses of dense engineering bricks such as Staffordshire blue bricks. This method of damp proofing appears as a distinctive navy blue band running around the circumference of a building. The efficacy of this means of keeping out damp is more limited by the permeability of the mortar bedding and perpends joining the bricks, than by that of the bricks themselves.|$|E

25|$|Another alternative, {{suitable}} for <b>solid</b> <b>wall</b> enclosures, is to {{attach to the}} wall a horizontal piece of screen that projects inward several inches over the enclosure. The screen is made with material such as nylon monofilament that is moderately stiff and springy yet easily flexible. On the inside edge of the screen, the cross fibers are removed, producing a fringe several inches wide. When a snail crawls {{on the underside of}} the screen and moves out onto the fringe, his weight pulls several individual fibers down. One by one, another fiber gets away from the snail and springs back up out of reach. Eventually the snail is dangling by a thread. The snail then falls, because the surface area is not big enough to crawl on.|$|E
25|$|A heat {{exchanger}} is a device used to transfer heat between a solid object and a fluid, or between {{two or more}} fluids. The fluids may be separated by a <b>solid</b> <b>wall</b> to prevent mixing {{or they may be}} in direct contact. They are widely used in space heating, refrigeration, air conditioning, power stations, chemical plants, petrochemical plants, petroleum refineries, natural-gas processing, and sewage treatment. The classic example of a {{heat exchanger}} is found in an internal combustion engine in which a circulating fluid known as engine coolant flows through radiator coils and air flows past the coils, which cools the coolant and heats the incoming air. Another example is the heat sink, which is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid medium, often air or a liquid coolant.|$|E

There are many skeletons of small animals littering the floor and even a gigantic skin shed by the Basilisk. The tunnel leads to a <b>solid</b> <b>wall,</b> carved with two entwined serpents with emeralds for eyes. At a command in Parseltongue, the wall opens to expose a long, dim corridor, lined with monumental statues of snakes, including two rows of towering stone pillars with more carved serpents that brace the ceiling. A colossal statue of Salazar Slytherin, looking ancient and monkey-like, is at the centre. The Basilisk rested inside the statue and emerged from its mouth when the Heir of Slytherin, Tom Riddle, summoned it.|$|E

25|$|The Thornycroft boiler is {{a variant}} that splits the usual central furnace into two. There are four drums: two main drums {{vertically}} in the centre – a steam and a water drum – also two wing drums {{at the outside}} edges of the furnace. The design was notable for its early use of the water-wall furnace. The outer bank of tubes was shallow, consisting of only two rows of tubes. These rows were spaced closely, so that the tubes formed a <b>solid</b> <b>wall,</b> without gasflow between them. The inner bank of tubes was similar: the two rows of tubes closest to the furnace formed a similar water wall. These tubes were splayed apart at their base, so as to provide space for gasflow between them. Within the tube bank, gas flow is mostly parallel to the tubes, similar to some early designs, but contrary to the crossflow design of later three-drum boilers. The exhaust gas emerged into the heart-shaped space below the upper central drum, exiting to the funnel through the rear wall.|$|E

Direct free kicks can be made directly on goal. Offensive players attempt numerous tricks to beat the defenders, who often form a <b>solid</b> <b>wall</b> of players {{directly in front of}} the goal. Attackers may attempt to blast the ball through the defensive wall, or curl it over or around using spin. A less common idea is to hit the ball powerfully and straight along the floor, since the defenders in the wall usually jump to try and prevent a shot being lifted over their heads.

25|$|Archaeological {{exploration}} of Yodfat has revealed traces of habitation {{from the early}} Hellenistic Period (4th and 3rd centuries BCE) through Roman times, though the town reached its zenith in the 1st century CE, prior to the revolt, when it expanded from {{the summit of the}} hill to its southern plateau. The same excavations have also revealed two, perhaps three, phases of fortification. The first, a wall surrounding the summit, was dated to the early 1st century BCE and attributed to the Hasmonean kings who had at the time expanded their influence to the Galilee. These were later bolstered by an additional parallel wall, while a massive tower stood {{at the center of the}} site and a small one to the west. The final phase of fortification took place at the turn of the millennium, with the construction of a wall that encompassed both the summit and the southern plateau, an area of roughly 47 dunams (approx. 12 acres). On the accessible northern side of Yodfat this was composed of a case-mate wall, turning into a single <b>solid</b> <b>wall</b> enforced with a few towers beyond the summit. The single wall closely followed the topography of the hill and in some cases directly abutted or incorporated existing buildings, suggesting it was constructed in haste, during stressful times. These may have been the revolt-era fortifications Josephus attributes to himself.|$|E

40|$|Conjugate heat {{transfer}} between fluid-saturated porous media and <b>solid</b> <b>walls</b> {{is an important}} issue in many disciplines. For traditional numerical techniques, it is still a great challenge to treat conjugate problems, especially with complicated interfaces. In the present work, a new numerical approach, based on the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, is proposed to address such challenge. In the present approach no explicit special treatment on coupled interfaces between fluid-saturated porous media and <b>solid</b> <b>walls</b> is required. Moreover, no additional source term, which exists in the available LB models, is required. It can guarantee that the simplicity, accuracy and stability of the present model are better than those models. The accuracy and reliability of the present approach are validated by three nontrivial benchmark tests. The excellent agreement with previous published data demonstrates its feasibility and simplicity for modelling conjugate {{heat transfer}} with complicated interfaces between fluid-saturated porous media and <b>solid</b> <b>walls.</b> The present work takes a single-relaxation-time model for example to address conjugate heat transfer problems and its multiple-relaxation-time counterpart can be established straightforwardly in the same way...|$|R

40|$|We present molecular-dynamics {{results for}} the {{squeezing}} of octane (C 8 H 18) between two approaching <b>solid</b> elastic <b>walls</b> with different wetting properties. The interaction energy between the octane bead units and the <b>solid</b> <b>walls</b> is varied from a very small value (1 meV), corresponding to a nonwetting surface with a very large contact angle (nearly 180 degrees), to a high value (18. 6 meV) corresponding to complete wetting. When {{at least one of}} the <b>solid</b> <b>walls</b> is wetted by octane we observe well defined molecular layers develop in the lubricant film when the thickness of the film is of the order of a few atomic diameters. An external squeezing-pressure induces discontinuous, thermally activated changes in the number n of lubricant layers (n [...] >n- 1 layering transitions). With increasing interaction energy between the octane bead units and the <b>solid</b> <b>walls,</b> the transitions from n to n- 1 layers occur at higher average pressure. This results from the increasing activation barrier to nucleate the squeeze-out with increasing lubricant-wall binding energy (per unit surface area) in the contact zone. Thus, strongly wetting lubricant fluids are better boundary lubricants than the less wetting ones, and this should result in less wear. We analyze in detail the effect of capillary bridge formation (in the wetting case) and droplets formation (in the nonwetting case) on the forces exerted by the lubricant on the walls. For the latter case small liquid droplets may be trapped at the interface, resulting in a repulsive force between the walls during squeezing, until the <b>solid</b> <b>walls</b> come into direct contact, where the wall-wall interaction may be initially attractive. This effect is made use of in some practical applications, and we give one illustration involving conditioners for hair care application...|$|R
