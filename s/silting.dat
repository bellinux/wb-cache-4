5|$|Land {{reclamation}} schemes, {{especially those}} by Henry Calthorpe in 1640 {{just to the}} west of Cley, led to the <b>silting</b> up of the Glaven shipping channel and relocation of Cley's wharf. Further enclosure in the mid-1820s aggravated the problem, and also allowed the shingle ridge at the beach to block the former tidal channel to the Salthouse marshes to the east of Cley. In an attempt to halt the decline, Thomas Telford was consulted in 1822, but his recommendations for reducing the <b>silting</b> were not implemented, and by 1840 almost all of Cley's trade had been lost. The population stagnated, and the value of all property decreased sharply. Blakeney's shipping trade benefited from the <b>silting</b> up of its nearby rival, and in 1817 the channel to the Haven was deepened to improve access. Packet ships ran to Hull and London from 1840, but this trade declined as ships became too large for the harbour.|$|E

To this end, a multiphase flow model was employed {{based on the}} interMixingfoam Solver in OpenFOAM. The influence of different <b>silts</b> on water over a shoreline was investigated with different parameters such as <b>silt</b> viscosity, <b>silt</b> density, and inlet-water velocity. The developed numerical model was applied to general water <b>silt</b> interaction problems over a seabed; the main aspects studied were the water <b>silt</b> interaction and the corresponding water <b>silt</b> interface. The results showed that attenuation first increased, then decreased from soft to hard <b>silts.</b> Maximum attenuation was observed for <b>silt</b> 3 (i. e., some hard <b>silt).</b> Furthermore, the higher the inlet-water and inlet-silt speeds, the more the water and <b>silt</b> mixed.

30|$|The {{generation}} of coarse <b>silt</b> with sand and mud clasts {{may have been}} explained by brecciation of slightly less dense but cohesive silt and sand and mixing of the brecciated clasts (sand and mud clasts) with less cohesive <b>silt</b> (<b>silt</b> slurry) created by seismic tremor.

40|$|Erosion and {{sediment}} controls on construction sites minimize environmental impacts from sediment-laden stormwater runoff. <b>Silt</b> fence, a widely specified perimeter control practice on construction projects used to retain sediment on-site, has limited performance-based testing data. <b>Silt</b> fence failures and resultant sediment losses {{are often the}} result of structural failure. To better understand <b>silt</b> fence performance, researchers at the Auburn University-Erosion and Sediment Control Testing Facility (AU-ESCTF) have evaluated three <b>silt</b> fence options to determine possible shortcomings using standardized full-scale testing methods. These methods subject <b>silt</b> fence practices to simulated, in-field conditions typically experienced on-site without the variability of field testing or the limited application of small-scale testing.

30|$|The {{characteristics}} of this deformed bed (ca. 0.6  m thick) {{are similar to}} those described above except for the absence of strongly stretched sand and <b>silt</b> lens. This interval hosts two massive coarse <b>silt</b> parts and an interbedded massive sand part (Fig.  8 a). Both of the coarse <b>silt</b> parts have an indistinct basal boundary (Fig.  8 a). Numerous small rounded mud clasts are scattered in {{the upper part of the}} massive sand and in the overlying upper coarse <b>silt</b> (Fig.  8 b). The rounded sand clasts, which seem to have been originated from the underlying sand are contained in the upper coarse <b>silt</b> (Fig.  8 b). The boundary of the massive sand and the upper coarse <b>silt</b> shows flame-like shape in some part (Fig.  8 b), revealing both the parts were under the liquefied state when this boundary deformation occurred.

5|$|Trade on {{the lower}} river was carried in barges and keels. During the early 1800s as trade was increasing, so the river was {{simultaneously}} <b>silting</b> up. Around 1800, vessels carrying 60 tons could reach the port facilities at Spalding; however, by the 1820s, ships could only be loaded with 40 tons each as the river <b>silting</b> had worsened. Trade records indicate that in 1829, vessels carried just under 20,000 tons to and from Spalding, and by 1835 this had increased to over 34,000 tons. There was pressure from merchants to cater for larger vessels, and with later improvements, carried out under an act of parliament obtained in 1837, barges and sloops of up to 120 tons could use the port. Because the river was maintained for drainage, some commercial traffic continued despite the railways, and tolls of £478 were collected on 11,690 tons in 1888. Coal for Spalding gasworks arrived by boat until the early 1900s, and the last regular trade was the carriage of corn, hay and straw from Spalding to Fosdyke, where the cargo was transferred to larger ships. All commercial carrying had ceased {{by the end of}} the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th {{and early}} 19th century, Ceredigion had more {{industry}} {{than it does}} today; Cardigan was the commercial centre of the county; lead, silver and zinc were mined and Cardigan was the principal port of South Wales prior to the <b>silting</b> of its harbour. The economy became highly dependent on dairy farming and the rearing of livestock for the English market. During the last century, livestock farming has become less profitable, and the population of Cardiganshire has been in decline as people moved to the more prosperous parts of Wales or emigrated to other countries. More recently, the population has started rising again as elderly people move into the county for retirement, and various government and European Union initiatives have encouraged tourism and other alternative sources of income.|$|E
5|$|Mineral {{resources}} {{near the}} top end of the canal included ironstone, which was normally extracted by scouring.

The Fox family, who were based at Neath Abbey, but who were scouring ironstone further up the valley, agreed to construct a new feeder in 1807 to mitigate the problem. Protests made to the Tappendens, who were scouring at Pen-rhiw and Cwm Gwrelych, were less successful. As the pounds were <b>silting</b> up, the company took legal action in 1811. The court found in their favour, recognising that the canal would soon be useless unless something was done.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Turbine is {{the most}} {{important}} part of hydro power plant which converts the potential energy of water into mechanical energy. The presence of <b>silt</b> in water erodes the turbine material. Erosion of turbine decreases the performance of turbine, life of the turbine as well as loss of power generation. This paper presents a new approach for the study of <b>silt</b> erosion of hydro turbine. In this study, weight of eroded material of turbine have been determined by employing criterion of plastic strain which include parameters (<b>silt</b> size, <b>silt</b> hardness, concentration of <b>silt,</b> flow velocity, hardness of turbine material) affecting <b>silt</b> erosion of turbine. Results have been verified with experimental work for Pelton turbine having 16 buckets made up of brass material. It is seen that the results of analytical study matches with the experimental work.

5|$|The Great Western Railway {{originated}} from {{the desire of}} Bristol merchants to maintain their city as the second port {{of the country and}} the chief one for American trade. The increase in the size of ships and the gradual <b>silting</b> of the River Avon had made Liverpool an increasingly attractive port, and with a Liverpool to London rail line under construction in the 1830s Bristol's status was threatened. The answer for Bristol was, with the co-operation of London interests, to build a line of their own; a railway built to unprecedented standards of excellence to out-perform the lines being constructed to the North West of England.|$|E

40|$|Renewed {{interest}} in land management practices, like conservation tillage techniques on agricultural lands and timber harvesting, prescribed fires and wildfires on forested lands has made it desirable to measure hillslope soil erosion. Measuring soil erosion is generally costly and time consuming requiring expensive equipment, many site visits and laboratory analyses. The objective {{of the study was}} to determine the suitability of <b>silt</b> fences for measuring onsite hillslope erosion. <b>Silt</b> fences are low-cost and easy to install.
