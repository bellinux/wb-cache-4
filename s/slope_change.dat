Obstructions or slope changes are routinely designed into the apron to force a jump at a specific location.

To trigger the hydraulic jump without obstacles, an apron is designed such that the flat slope of the apron retards the rapidly flowing water from the spillway.

50|$|Combustion during TG {{analysis}} is identifiable by distinct traces {{made in the}} TGA thermograms produced. One interesting example occurs with samples of as-produced unpurified carbon nanotubes that have {{a large amount of}} metal catalyst present. Due to combustion, a TGA trace can deviate from the normal form of a well-behaved function. This phenomenon arises from a rapid temperature change. When the weight and temperature are plotted versus time, a dramatic <b>slope</b> <b>change</b> in the first derivative plot is concurrent with the mass loss of the sample and the sudden increase in temperature seen by the thermocouple. The mass loss could be the result of particles of smoke released from burning caused by inconsistencies in the material itself, beyond the oxidation of carbon due to poorly controlled weight loss.|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} source of sea-level observations comes from the global network of tide gauges. Church and White (2006) used this network in combination with satellite altimeter data to establish that global mean sea-level rose 19.5 cm between 1870 and 2004 at an average rate of about 1.44 mm/yr (1.7 mm/yr during the 20th century). The SLR trend increases over this period, with a notable <b>slope</b> <b>change</b> around 1930, resulting in a significant acceleration of 0.013 ± 0.006 mm yr-2. This is an important confirmation of climate change simulations predicting that SLR will accelerate in response to global warming. If this acceleration remains constant then the amount of rise from 1990 to 2100 will range from 28 to 34 cm. This is consistent with model results in which global average sea level was projected to rise 18 to 59 cm by 2100. Church and White (2006) note that the recent increase in SLR {{at the end of}} the 20th century is not statistically distinguishable from decadal variations in sea level that have occurred throughout the record.|$|E

40|$|The study {{proposes a}} new {{procedure}} {{referred to as}} Slope and Level Change (SLC) for separately estimating <b>slope</b> <b>change</b> and level change between two adjacent phases in single-case designs, for instance between a baseline phase (denoted by A) and a treatment phase (denoted by B). Firstly, SLC eliminates baseline trend from the data series using a differencing method, instead of the commonly used regression. Secondly, the method used for estimating trend is also used for estimating <b>slope</b> <b>change.</b> After the <b>slope</b> <b>change</b> has been controlled for, the pure level change is estimated.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this human}} study, {{the effect of}} <b>slopes</b> <b>changes</b> of motion surface on four muscles fatigue of lower limb was {{investigated}} by surface electromyography. Zero, 10 and 20 degree slopes of a treadmill with constant speed of 5 km/h were used. Seven mature men were selected. Each man as walked on the treadmill at each slope for five minutes time. Then, muscles signals were recorded before and after walking on treadmill by surface electromyography. Time period of between tests for each person on different slopes of treadmill was 48 hours. It was revealed that between fatigue rate of muscles, at zero degree slope, was not significantly different (P> 0. 05). But, at 10 degree slope, between fatigue rate of Tibialis and others was significantly different (P< 0. 05) and was increased. Also, at 20 degree slope, between fatigue rate of Quadriceps and others was significantly different (P< 0. 05) and was increased too.

40|$|Subsistence theory {{predicts the}} {{distress}} sale of labor {{at very low}} wages, such that the income effect dominates not only at high wages (as is relatively established) but also below a ‘subsistence wage’. This theory has been developed and tested {{in the context of}} mainly agricultural economies, but more recent theoretical work has suggested its applicability in industrialized economies, where it has not yet been tested. Some previous studies of labor supply {{in the context of the}} United States have experimented with flexible functional forms, noting that the canonical model makes no a priori predictions as to its shape. However, little attention is given to the <b>slope</b> <b>changes</b> themselves, which are of prime importance in subsistence theory. This paper uses a unique method of pinpointing endogenous <b>slope</b> <b>changes</b> in the estimated labor supply response, finding the ‘subsistence wage’ to be $ 6. 60 /hr ($ 8. 39 in 2008 dollars) using 2000 Census data.

No attempt has been previously made to relate this wall kinetic change and transmitral flow rate. In 25 normal subjects, 14 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (Group 1) and 17 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Group 2), M-mode echocardiography studies were performed on the posterior wall and mitral valve. Transient values of mitral orifice area were calculated and transmitral flow velocities were recorded: area and velocity data yielded transmitral flow rates. Time intervals were determined from mitral opening to peak early area, velocity and flow rate and to posterior wall <b>slope</b> <b>change.</b> An additional group included five patients with a mitral prosthesis. The posterior wall <b>slope</b> <b>change</b> was present when part of the myocardial structures were almost akinetic or when mitral chordae tendineae were absent; <b>slope</b> <b>change</b> appeared as a regional phenomenon in the free wall. In the normal subjects, close values were found for the four time intervals. In the patients with dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, peak early velocity (95. 7 t 16. 7 and 146. 2 ± 31. 4 ms, respectively), peak flow rate (84. 7 18. 2 and 137. 4 ± 29. 5 ms) and time to <b>slope</b> <b>change</b> (91. 4 ± 18. 6 and 133. 6 ± 32. 7 ms) were significantly delayed (p < 0. 001) in comparison with peak area (56. 6 t 9. 5 and 84. 3 22. 5 ms). <b>Slope</b> <b>change</b> does not indicate {{the end of the}} early filling phase but, rather, its transition from acceleration to decelciation Time to peak velocity or time to peak filling rate must be considered in a relaxation analysis...|$|E

Paczynski has proposed that, if GRBs are at cosmological distances, and if their spectral <b>slopes</b> <b>change</b> gradually, then the weaker bursts should have softer spectra than the stronger bursts. Here we first analyzed {{the relation between the}} gamma-ray bursts fluence and the hardness ratio, and found that, there is no correlation for all bursts, while for either long duration or short duration bursts, their hardness ratio increase with the fluence, which implies that the longer and short bursts are different. Then we assume the emission spectra of bursts and their afterglow are not an exact power law, the <b>slopes</b> <b>changes</b> smoothly, dβ/d logν< 0, where β is the spectral index, we found that this spectra can fit the afterglow light curves with breaks very well. Therefore we suggest that some breaks in the afterglow light curves may be caused by their curved spectra. The main feature of this interpretation is that the break time is dependent on the observed frequency, while the jet model produces the achromatic breaks in the light curves...|$|R
