60|$|He {{raised her}} hand {{to his lips and}} kissed her fingers, one by one. Then he left the room. She listened to his {{footsteps}} descending the stairs, firm, resolute, deliberate. They paused, there was a sound of voices--the prince and he were exchanging greetings; then she heard other footsteps ascending, lighter, <b>smoother,</b> <b>yet</b> just as deliberate.|$|R
5000|$|AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{observes that}} My Favorites [...] "does {{differ from the}} {{previous}} Mercury recordings in terms of production - the UA release is slightly <b>smoother,</b> <b>yet</b> it is still firmly in the honky tonk tradition" [...] and comments that Jones delivers the songs [...] "with affection and grit, making the record a thoroughly enjoyable listen." ...|$|R
5000|$|James [...] "Jimmy" [...] Jones (June 2, 1937 - August 2, 2012) was an American singer-songwriter {{who moved}} to New York City while a teenager. According to Allmusic {{journalist}} Steve Huey, [...] "best known for his 1960 R&B smash, 'Handy Man,' Jones sang in a <b>smooth</b> <b>yet</b> soulful falsetto modeled on the likes of Clyde McPhatter and Sam Cooke." ...|$|R

50|$|For 1992 the Grand Am {{received}} {{new body}} {{work and a}} revised interior. A V6 option returned {{in the form of}} the 160 hp 3.3 L 3300 V6. The 2.3 inline four came as either a SOHC or DOHC. A high output version of the DOHC was offered as well. A new GT trim was offered that featured sportier wheels, <b>smoother,</b> <b>yet</b> larger cladding, and more standard equipment.|$|R
60|$|His {{dark face}} was <b>smooth,</b> <b>yet</b> {{it seemed to}} have lines under the surface. Shefford was impressed. He had never seen an Indian who {{interested}} him as this one. Looked at superficially, he appeared young, wild, silent, locked in his primeval apathy, just a healthy savage; but looked at more attentively, he appeared matured, even old, a strange, sad, brooding figure, with a burden on his shoulders. Shefford found himself growing curious.|$|R

The tuning of the controller determines {{the dynamics of the}} system, which can then be good (<b>smooth</b> <b>yet</b> responsive) or bad (ineffective or unstable). A methodical investigation was conducted to determine the minimal model of the wind turbine structure and aerodynamics {{that can be used to}} tune the controller gains for large, multi-MW offshore wind turbines...|$|R
50|$|Faure {{possessed a}} dark, <b>smooth</b> <b>yet</b> {{flexible}} baritone voice, {{which he used}} with impeccable skill and taste. He was a sophisticated interpretive artist, too, and all these accomplishments combined to make {{him one of the}} most significant figures to have appeared on the French musical stage during the 19th century. He wrote two books on singing, La Voix et le Chant (1886) and Aux Jeunes Chanteurs (1898), and also taught at the Paris Conservatory from 1857 to 1860.|$|R
5000|$|John McVey (born John McVey Criscitiello; November 18, 1959) is an American folk rock singer-songwriter from Princeton, New Jersey. His {{style of}} music {{is part of the}} new folk {{acoustic}} movement, bringing elements of pop, rock and folk music to modern audiences. Now living in Colorado, local magazine 5280 describes McVey by saying, [...] "McVey's <b>smooth</b> <b>yet</b> lightly smoky voice create a soft rock, adult contemporary sound that draws worthy comparisons to Marc Cohen, Shawn Colvin, and Daryl Hall".|$|R
5000|$|Rain's vocal range can be {{classified}} in the tenor range. His voice {{can be described as}} <b>smooth</b> <b>yet</b> husky [...] in songs such as [...] "Love Story", [...] "Love Song", [...] "Nan" [...] and [...] "I Do." [...] Having been influenced by American R&B, he uses both vibrato and falsetto in many of his songs as well as incorporating rapping into songs like [...] "What's Love." [...] Rain maintains strong stance against lipsyncing during his live performances.|$|R
5000|$|... "Windowlicker" [...] {{consists}} of James' voice modulated on computer, mixed with his trademark breakbeat snare rushes, drum samples, and mixed choir-like singing, {{resulting in a}} <b>smooth</b> <b>yet</b> erratic song with the last minute of the track escalating into an extremely distorted wall of bass. Also included is a sample of a French voice, saying either J'aime faire des croquettes au chien (translating to [...] "I like to make dog nuggets") or J'aime faire des cracottes au chien (translating to [...] "I like to make dog cracottes").|$|R
5000|$|Hesse’s {{interest}} in latex {{as a medium}} for sculptural forms {{had to do with}} immediacy. Keats states, [...] "immediacy {{may be one of the}} prime reasons Hesse was attracted to latex". Hesse’s first two works using latex, Schema and Sequel (1967-68) use latex in a way never imagined by the manufacturer. [...] "Industrial latex was meant for casting. Hesse handled it like house paint, brushing layer upon layer to build up a surface that was <b>smooth</b> <b>yet</b> irregular, ragged at the edges like deckled paper." ...|$|R
5000|$|Her {{performance}} has been rated as [...] "an explosion of raw intimacy with very personalized melodies that float over a <b>smooth</b> <b>yet</b> energy-driven soundtrack where Chill-out Lounge, R & B and vestiges of World Music {{come together to}} form her own very unique concept of artistry and creativity. She has a rare labyrinth of soothing, intimate, and delicate cadence in her voice that simply grabs you and brings chills up your spine; {{and at the same}} time you’ll feel that she is whispering her sundry and powerful voice in your ear." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "A {{power of}} acceleration, amazingly swift and <b>smooth,</b> <b>yet</b> {{perfectly}} controlled ... the thrilling {{characteristics of a}} racer in a machine tamed to behave in mannerly fashion ... the engine which gives 100 brake horse power {{on the bench and}} which will propel the car at over 80 miles an hour on the level can be throttled down until the vehicle is running smoothly at 12-15 miles an hour." [...] "It is certainly the greediest motor of the touring type that I have driven. I do not mean in petrol but in a straining desire to be allowed to go ever faster." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Thom Jurek awarded the album 4 stars and stated [...] "it's a wildly {{textured}} and seamless aural meld of gritty B-3 jams, <b>smooth</b> <b>yet</b> psychedelic soul, rock, pop, and funk... somehow, this ambitious, lushly orchestrated album not only sounds current, but still {{ahead of its}} time. Highly recommended". The song [...] "We're in Love" [...] has been sampled multiple times, most famously by DJ Premier on Nas' 1994 debut album Illmatic in the song [...] "Memory Lane (Sittin' in da Park)". It was also sampled in the song [...] "I Ain't the Damn One" [...] by rapper Scientifik.|$|R
50|$|This album, {{although}} {{somewhat different}} from the previous Fleshcrawl releases, is highly archetypal of the band's general 1990s sound. It is more rhythmic than its predecessors, helping to fortify the band's stake in the Melodic death metal genre, and is strongly characterized by agile, and <b>smooth,</b> <b>yet</b> sometimes dramatic patterning transitions, medium-to-high tempo cyclic Riffs that sometimes resemble Speed metal, baritonic Death Growls, and rapid Double-Bass Drum rolls, typical of death metal. The general themes of the album remain consistent with earlier releases, and cover such concepts as violent death, hell-born rebirth (Hellspawn), misanthropy (Bloodred Massacre), deception (The Messenger), and eternal damnation (Through The Veil of Dawn).|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} YMCA Kwon Bup Bu and Chang Moo Kwan, the {{curriculum}} consisted of karate and chuan-fa. (McLain, 2009) This {{was one of}} two Kwans to have been influenced by Chuan-fa(Kwon Bup), which gave the techniques a <b>smooth</b> <b>yet</b> hard appearance when practiced or demonstrated. Chuan-fa forms from the Chang Moo Kwan included [...] "Dan Kwon", [...] "Doju San", [...] "Jang Kwon", [...] "Taijo Kwon", and Palgi Kwon", among others. Early students practiced a bong hyung (staff form) created by Byung In Yoon himself and another created by Yoon Gwe-Byung (Yoon Kwe-Byung), who was a Shudokan practitioner and became a grandmaster of the Jidokwan.|$|R
5000|$|The Styre {{originated}} in the Forest of Dean, where it grew well on the local thin limestone soils: in common {{with a handful of}} other old apple varieties, it could be simply propagated without grafting, by striking root from branches pulled from the tree's crown. Although the variety's age is unknown, it was clearly very old, its name having a possible Anglo-Saxon root. The Styre had a reputation for producing a valuable, exceptionally flavoursome and unusually strong cider. John Philips, in his 1708 poem Cyder, refers to it as [...] "Stirom, firmest fruit", and describes it as making a long-lasting, <b>smooth,</b> <b>yet</b> deceptively strong drink.|$|R

40|$|Virtual force {{approach}} is preferable for motion planning of mobile robots in dynamic environments. It composes virtual attractive forces to drive robots to destinations and virtual repulsive forces to steer robots away from neighbouring robots. However, most traditional methods use functions with limited controllable parameters, compromising design flexibility essential for <b>smooth</b> <b>yet</b> responsive robot motions. This paper proposes a spline-based method to enhance design flexibility of virtual forces that streamline robot motions. We {{take advantage of}} local controllability of interpolating cubic splines to generate desirable smooth virtual forces for robots. This merit facilitates responsive robot motions in dynamic situations. A case study of autonomous military robots is presented to validate the approach, in terms of enhanced motion safety and shortened operational time...|$|R
5000|$|Adios {{received}} positive reviews. Gina Boldman of Allmusic {{said of the}} album: [...] "KMFDM sound <b>smoother</b> <b>yet</b> {{maintain their}} emotive mayhem in all its glory." [...] The staff of PopMatters called Adios a [...] "superb mix of the anarchaic fueled fury of the 80’s and a full awareness of what their genre has become." [...] Remarking on the band's then-disbandment, they further stated that KMFDM [...] "left us with something to remember them by." [...] Amy Sciarretto of CMJ New Music Report said that Adios [...] "continues in the group's grand tradition of techno-informed, industrial-fueled beat manipulation". She said the beats, guitars, and female vocals formed [...] "an electrifying chemistry", concluding, [...] "Adios is a satisfying sendoff for KMFDM and its legion of fans." ...|$|R

O chill and fettered rhyme Yet my great bliss, though still entirely blest, Losing its proper home, can find no rest: [...] So, like a child who whiles away the time With dance and carol till the eventide, Watching its mother homeward through the glen; Or nightingale, who, sitting far apart, Tells to his {{listening}} mate within the nest The wonder of his star-entranced heart Till all the wakened woodlands laugh and thrill-- [...] Forth all my being bubbles into song; [...] And rings aloft, not <b>smooth,</b> <b>yet</b> clear and strong.|$|R
60|$|The Prince {{found her}} {{alone in the}} winter garden, for Somerfield, when he had seen him coming, had stolen away. He came towards her quickly, with the <b>smooth</b> <b>yet</b> impetuous step which singled him out at once as un-English. He had the whole room to cross to come to her, and she watched him all the way. The corners of his lips were already curved in a slight smile. His eyes were bright, as one who looks upon {{something}} which he greatly desires. Slender though his figure was, his frame was splendidly knit, and he carried himself {{as one of the}} aristocrats of the world. As he approached, she scanned his face curiously. She became critical, anxiously but ineffectively. There was not a feature in his face with which a physiognomist could have found fault.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn a bounded {{domain of}} ^n+ 1, n≥ 2, we {{consider}} a second-order elliptic operator, A=-_̣x_ 0 ^ 2 - ∇_x · (c(x) ∇_x), where the (scalar) coefficient c(x) is piecewise <b>smooth</b> <b>yet</b> discontinuous across a smooth interface S. We prove a local Carleman estimate for A in the of any {{point of the}} interface. The "observation" region can be chosen independently of {{the sign of the}} jump of the coefficient c at the considered point. The derivation of this estimate relies on the separation of the problem into three microlocal regions and the Calderón projector technique. Following the method of Lebeau and Robbiano LR: 95 we then prove the null controllability for the linear parabolic initial problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions associated to the operator _̣t - ∇_x · (c(x) ∇_x) ...|$|R

In this study, Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy films (Ti alloy film) were produced using a three-dimensional printing technique called Selective Laser Melting (SLM), {{which is one of}} the metal additive manufacturing techniques. The thickness of produced Ti alloy film was approximately 250 μm. The laser-irradiated surface of Ti alloy film had a relatively <b>smooth</b> <b>yet</b> porous surface.

50|$|The Burseraceae are {{characterized}} by the nonallergenic resin they produce in virtually all plant tissue and the distinctive <b>smooth,</b> <b>yet</b> flaking, aromatic bark,. The origins of the family {{can be traced to}} the Paleocene (about 65 Mya) when Beiselia mexicana first diverged in Mexico. The subsequent divergences in the family lineage and migration of the species in the Eocene (53 Mya) from North America have led to the current distributions of the species that are primarily associated with the tropics. Though the family likely originated in North America, the greatest generic diversity presently is in the Southern Hemisphere. Tabonuco (Dacryodes excelsa) and gumbo limbo (Bursera simaruba) represent the economic, ethnobotanical, and ecological significance of the Burseraceae in the Western Hemisphere, while frankincense (Boswellia sacra) and myrrh (Commiphora myrrha) represent the same in the Eastern Hemisphere.|$|R
