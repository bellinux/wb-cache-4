Applications determine what data they need to send and then use a new <b>transfer</b> <b>service</b> to send it. This <b>transfer</b> <b>service</b> acts as a common interface between applications and the lower-level network layers, facilitating innovation both above and below. The <b>transfer</b> <b>service</b> frees developers from re-inventing transfer mechanisms in each new application. New transfer mechanisms, in turn, can be easily deployed without modifying existing applications. We discus...|$|R

In practice, a client accessing a secured resource at a service provider will be redirected to the inter-site <b>transfer</b> <b>service</b> at the identity provider, but the precise sequence of steps needed to accomplish this is not outlined by SAML 1.1. (See section 4.3 of SAMLOverview for some rough ideas along these lines.) This scenario is thoroughly addressed in SAML 2.0.|$|R

3000|$|Equation 9 {{is derived}} {{considering}} that the Web Browsing service sessions in the WLAN {{are not able to}} constitute a virtual [...] " [...] long-live" [...] TCP session. An active File <b>Transfer</b> <b>service</b> session can be considered as one [...] "long-live" [...] TCP session. As the value of encp is smaller than the number of File <b>Transfer</b> <b>service</b> sessions plus one, it means that, by neglecting the File <b>Transfer</b> <b>service</b> sessions, the Web Browsing service sessions cannot make the value of encp {{greater than or equal to}} one. Such result indicates that, on average, there is less than one Web Browsing service packet in contention to access the network channel at any time. Therefore, from a Web Browsing service session's point of view, during the ON period, the major competition it will face is from the active File <b>Transfer</b> <b>service</b> sessions rather than the peer Web Browsing service sessions. Therefore, the effective packet transmission rate for the Web Browsing service session can be calculated as wlan_data_rate/(n_ftp_session+ 1).|$|R
