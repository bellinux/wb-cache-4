50|$|During the 1930s, the Kandahar binding was introduced, {{which could}} be locked down at the heel for the {{downhill}} portions. The Kandahar remained in widespread use until the 1960s. As more skiers took up the sport, especially in the 1950s, broken legs became common. Dr. Richard Spademan saw 150 spiral fractures pass through his emergency department near Squaw Valley in three days, an event {{that led to the}} development of the Spademan binding. By the early 1950s, several <b>safety</b> <b>bindings</b> were on the market that allowed the ski to come off when the ski twisted to the side. This helped reduce the incidence of spiral fractures.|$|R
50|$|However, {{as there}} was no {{standardization}} of these mounting locations, designing a binding that worked with any boot was difficult. Worse, on leather boots the mounting point would change as the leather wore down, or even due to flexing during the day. One {{solution to this problem}} was to use small metal fittings screwed into the boot, to provide a known and unchanging mounting point for the bindings. Solutions like these were features of the first <b>safety</b> <b>bindings,</b> the Hanson Ski Binding and Cubco, while popular designs of the 1970s used metal plates that extended along the entire sole of the boot. The bindings clipped onto these plates instead of the boot proper, providing a much more reliable release.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a newly developed safety concept for application of robotic walking simulators {{based on the}} principle of programmable footplates in gait rehabilitation. Unlike robotic hand devices or exoskeleton robots for gait training on treadmills, which can be built relatively lightweight and require only small drives which can hardly do harm to the patient, a programmable footplate walking simulator with permanent foot fixture essentially needs to have powerful drives in order to carry and move the full body weight of the patient. The developed safety concept comprises several redundant algorithms and devices in the real-time robot control software, electrical emergency stop circuitry and machine mechanics. The mechanical core is a machine design offering maximum passive security by covering all moving parts (i. e. robot drives and linkages) and a newly developed foot <b>safety</b> release <b>binding,</b> which is mounted on each footplate. The release binding allows a safe re lease from the footplate in all directions in any degree of freedom in the sagittal plane.

40|$|In orthogonally {{persistent}} systems, data {{is treated}} independently of its persistence allowing storage management details {{to be ignored}} by programmers. The coexistence of all data within a persistent repository provides new opportunities for the persistent environment {{to participate in a}} number of software engineering processes, namely, software:. construction,. debugging,. maintenance,. evolution, and. distribution. A novel programming methodology supporting various styles of binding allows the persistent environment to participate in the software construction process. Existing programs and data may be bound to an application at different times during the application's lifetime, namely, at run-time, compile-time and program construction-time. This wide range of binding styles enables. the programmer to trade off <b>binding</b> <b>safety</b> and <b>binding</b> flexibility. A mechanism called Octopus enables the programmer to access a rich source of information about the bindings within arbitrary values. Using this information, existing applications may be interrogated and manipulated in ways in which the programming language alone would not normally permit. However, Octopus ensures that the type system of the programming language remains inviolate, thus providing a type safe mechanism for constructing debugging, maintenance and evolutionary tools. Another feature of Octopus is that it permits portions of an application's object graph to be isolated and transmitted. Nodules permit a style of template programming that enables data values and executable code to be shared between different Nodule instances. The essence of this mechanism is to allow programs to be constructed and compiled without the requirement that the values used by the program be present. In this manner, individual components may be constructed independently and later assembled to form a complete application. Nodules also provide a rich source of information about the structure of an application and may be used in conjunction with Octopus to develop and maintain software components. This thesis describes in detail a persistent programming environment, the Octopus and Nodule mechanisms, and illustrates how each of these mechanisms, when used in conjunction with each other, provide a persistent integrated programming environment that supports a wide variety of software engineering activities otherwise lacking in conventional, or non-persistent systems.

40|$|Phosvitin is an {{egg yolk}} protein, {{constituted}} by 50 % of serines, {{which are all}} phosphorylated. This singularity makes of phosvitin {{one of the most}} <b>safety</b> natural iron <b>binding</b> molecules. When hen egg yolk is used as emulsifying agent, the adsorption of phosvitin could alter this iron binding property. Consequently, this work was performed to better understand emulsifying and interfacial properties of phosvitin in optimal metal binding conditions. We have studied sunflower oil-in-water emulsions of phosvitin at pH 5 and 6, and ionic strengths of 0. 05 and 0. 15 M. The oil droplet size, the stability against coalescence and flocculation, the composition of the interfacial protein film and the interfacial activity at model interfaces were analysed. Finally, the capacity of phosvitin to bind iron when it is anchored at the emulsion interface was investigated. Phosvitin showed satisfactory emulsifying capacity in conditions favouring iron fixation. In these conditions, emulsifying activity is sensitive to pH whereas flocculation is influenced by ionic strength. Coalescence destabilisation is not extended and the interfacial protein film has better characteristics at pH 5. Phosvitin was not efficient to reduce the oil-in-water interfacial tension, although at 0. 1 mg/ml the interfacial tension was reduced from 31 mN/m to 15 mN/m. The high iron binding capacity of phosvitin in solution is kept by interfacial adsorbed phosvitin. Finally, to explain the poor adsorption efficiency coupled with the suitable emulsifying properties of phosvitin and the preservation of the iron binding capacity, it is likely that phosvitin is anchored at the interface only by a tiny terminal portion, presenting the rest of the molecule solvated on the aqueous phase...|$|R
40|$|Raising of problem. In modern conditions, {{anthropogenic}} impact {{to the soil}} urban ecosystems is fairly stable over time and space, is manifested in various forms, as {{the transformation of the}} soil profile, the change in direction of the soil-forming processes, contamination of the various pollutants, and, above all, heavy metals (HM) – elements of the first class of the danger. Their sources of the income to the urban environment are industrial enterprises, transport, housing and communal services. Determination of the anthropogenic pressure to the urban soil is carried out by the environmental assessment of the HM polyelement contamination, which allows to establish not only the fact of pollution, but also limits of the possible load with considering regional background or sanitary standards – MPC. However, until now discussions arise regarding the index which will be carried out the valuation – the cornerstone of any methodological approach to the environmental assessment of the soil polyelement contamination by the HM of the urban ecosystems, which allows to establish not only the fact of contamination, but also limits the possible load, taking into account the regional background or sanitary norm – MPC. Purpose. Lies in the grounded selection of the environmental assessment indexes of the soil contamination by the HM of the urban ecosystems through a comparative analysis of the existing approaches, such as the determination of the summary contamination index (SCI), the index of the soil contamination (ISC), factor imbalance (Sd), taking into account environmental <b>safety</b> standards and <b>binding</b> to the specific conditions territory. Conclusion. In summary {{it should be noted that}} it is necessary to use a set of integrated indexes, including the SCI to determine the violation of the metals content with respect to the geochemical background of zonal soil, ISC – link the contamination level with health indexes of the environmental safety territory, and Sd – consider a soil destruction, which is caused the construction process. Statistical analysis indicates their high affinity, which is reflected by the correlation coefficients. According to the assessment of these indexes the soil of Dnipropetrovsk urban ecosystem is increasingly polluted by Pb and Zn than Ni, the contamination level is mainly low to moderate, and soil is mostly problematic and polluted by ISC, although there are some hot spots in industrial zones of the city...|$|R
40|$|The seismic {{behavior}} of RC one-story precast buildings is investigated in this thesis. Precast structures (mainly one-story) constitute {{the most widespread}} solution that accommodates industrial buildings in Europe. Recently, precast structures have been also increasingly used for buildings where many people are gathering together (i. e. most shopping centers, sports stadiums and apartment buildings), causing an increase of the risk related to these structures. Moreover, the safety of industrial precast buildings is a complex problem, that is related {{not only to the}} usual structural performance demand of the ordinary buildings but that is also related to functionality and production issues. The recent severe earthquakes demonstrated all these crucial features. The 20 th and 29 th May Emilia earthquakes, for example, hit several industrial precast structures, causing a huge economic loss (about 1 billion euros), injuries and fatalities. Moreover, the consequences become more serious if the functionality interruption (production interruption, job missing) as well as the loss of the contents (equipment, provisions, plants) are also taken into account. The exhibited vulnerability and the central role of this structural typology motivate the development of this work. The first part of this thesis deals with the global response of precast structures. This study focuses on both the evaluation of the main structural features (geometrical and dynamic) and the design code evolution. The experience of the earthquake (Emilia, 2012) is also described. Benchmark structures and existing buildings are investigated by means of nonlinear analyses in order to justify the recorded damages and to evaluate the effect of the most common deficiencies, observed in these buildings. These results are achieved by means of detailed structural models, proposed and validated in this work. These models are efficient tools, capable {{to take into account the}} most crucial aspects (connection systems and nonstructural elements influence) in the seismic response of this construction typology. The topic of the seismic <b>safety</b> of industrial <b>bindings</b> is of great interest at regional and national level. It should be managed with a systematic procedure, especially for those economically developed areas, where the late seismic classification caused a significant vulnerability of these structures. As a consequence of above, the described research provided the collaboration in the redaction of two important emergency documents for the retrofitting actions and for the damage assessment of industrial structures after a seismic event. The local response of the connection systems is investigated in the second part of this thesis. The dowel connections between the precast beams and the columns and the connections between the panels and the main structure are selected due to their evidenced vulnerability and their key role in the global response. Concerning the beam-to-column connections, the results of an experimental campaign are presented and discussed in order to evaluate the {{behavior of}} the system. The experimental results are also used to develop a FEM model of the connection that allows to evaluate the influence of some geometrical and design parameters. The behavior of the connection between the structural elements and the cladding panels systems is also studied. A novel model is proposed in order to take into account the possible interaction between the panels and the structure under seismic action. The results of the performed nonlinear dynamic analyses demonstrate the high influence of these nonstructural components in the response of the whole structure, as well as the inadequacy of the typical approach, used for the connections design. The influence of the cladding systems is also investigated by means of a seismic risk study that confirms their strong influence on the global behavior of precast structures. In the last part of the work, the model with cladding panels is further developed in order to record the progressive collapse of the panels during an earthquake; this model could be an interesting tool to evaluate the actual response of a one-story precast structure interacting with the cladding panel system...|$|R
40|$|Air {{traffic flow}} {{management}} {{is a critical}} component of air transport operations because at some point in time, often very frequently, one of more of the critical resources in the air transportation network has significantly reduced capacity, resulting in congestion and delay for airlines and other entities and individuals who use the network. Typically, these “bottlenecks” are noticed at a given airport or terminal area, but they also occur in en route airspace. The two-stage combinatorial optimization framework for air traffic flow management under constrained capacity that is presented in this thesis, represents a important step towards the full consideration of the combinatorial nature of air traffic flow management decision that is often ignored or dealt with via priority-based schemes. It also illustrates the similarities between two traffic flow management problems that heretofore were considered to be quite distinct. The runway systems at major airports are highly constrained resources. From the perspective of arrivals, unnecessary delays and emissions may occur during peak periods when one or more runways at an airport are in great demand while other runways at the same airport are operating under their capacity. The primary cause of this imbalance in runway utilization is that the traffic flow {{into and out of the}} terminal areas is asymmetric (as a result of airline scheduling practices), and arrivals are typically assigned to the runway nearest the fix through which they enter the terminal areas. From the perspective of departures, delays and emissions occur because arrivals take precedence over departures with regard to the utilization of runways (despite the absence of <b>binding</b> <b>safety</b> constraints), and because arrival trajectories often include level segments that ensure “procedural separation” from arriving traffic while planes are not allowed to climb unrestricted along the most direct path to their destination. Similar to the runway systems, the terminal radar approach control facilities (TRACON) boundary fixes are also constrained resources of the terminal airspace. Because some arrival traffic from different airports merges at an arrival fix, a queue for the terminal areas generally starts to form at the arrival fix, which are caused by delays due to heavy arriving traffic streams. The arrivals must then absorb these delays by path stretching and adjusting their speed, resulting in unplanned fuel consumption. However, these delays are often not distributed evenly. As a result, some arrival fixes experience severe delays while, similar to the runway systems, the other arrival fixes might experience no delays at all. The goal of this thesis is to develop a combined optimization approach for terminal airspace flow management that assigns a TRACON boundary fix and a runway to each flight while minimizing the required fuel burn and emissions. The approach lessens the severity of terminal capacity shortage caused by and imbalance of traffic demand by shunting flights from current positions to alternate runways. This is done by considering every possible path combination. To attempt to solve the congestion of the terminal airspace at both runways and arrival fixes, this research focuses on two sequential optimizations. The fix assignments are dealt with by considering, simultaneously, the capacity constraints of fixes and runways as well as the fuel consumption and emissions of each flight. The research also develops runway assignments with runway scheduling such that the total emissions produced in the terminal area and on the airport surface are minimized. The two-stage sequential framework is also extended to en route airspace. When en route airspace loses its capacity for any reason, e. g. severe weather condition, air traffic controllers and flight operators plan flight schedules together based on the given capacity limit, thereby maximizing en route throughput and minimizing flight operators' costs. However, the current methods have limitations due to the lacks of consideration of the combinatorial nature of air traffic flow management decision. One of the initial attempts to overcome these limitations is the Collaborative Trajectory Options Program (CTOP), which will be initiated soon by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The developed two-stage combinatorial optimization framework fits this CTOP perfectly from the flight operator's perspective. The first stage is used to find an optimal slot allocation for flights under satisfying the ration by schedule (RBS) algorithm of the FAA. To solve the formulated first stage problem efficiently, two different solution methodologies, a heuristic algorithm and a modified branch and bound algorithm, are presented. Then, flights are assigned to the resulting optimized slots in the second stage so as to minimize the flight operator's costs. Ph. D...|$|R
