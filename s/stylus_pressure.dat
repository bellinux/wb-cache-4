50|$|Upon the {{introduction}} of Blue Amberols in 1912, the M reproducer was supplanted by the Diamond A reproducer, which was designed for playing only celluloid cylinders. Its small-tipped conical diamond stylus and increased <b>stylus</b> <b>pressure</b> would seriously damage wax cylinders. External horn Edison phonographs were available with the Diamond B reproducer. Several other Amberola models less expensive than the IA (and later the 4-minute-only IB and III) were available, such as the V, VI, and X.|$|E

5000|$|Highway Hi-Fi {{units were}} {{factory-installed}} {{and were not}} available as aftermarket add-ons. With a tendency to break or malfunction, and {{a limited number of}} titles (which were available solely from one label's back catalog), the product was not a commercial success; Chrysler slowly began to pull support for Highway Hi-Fi as early as 1957 when high warranty service costs became evident. Another automobile record player was manufactured by RCA from 1960 to 1961. This later version dropped the [...] "Highway Hi-Fi" [...] label (not being Chrysler-exclusive) and played standard 45 RPM 7" [...] records. It, too, suffered a short lifespan: the players were even more prone to malfunction than those manufactured by CBS, and standard 7" [...] records had their grooves worn down rapidly by the high <b>stylus</b> <b>pressure</b> used to prevent skipping.|$|E
5000|$|The players {{themselves}} were manufactured by CBS Electronics. According {{to the official}} Chrysler press release of September 12, 1955, [...] "Highway Hi-Fi plays through {{the speaker of the}} car radio and uses the radio's amplifier system. The turntable for playing records, built for Chrysler by CBS-Columbia, is located in a shock-proof case mounted just below the center of the instrument panel. A tone arm, including sapphire stylus and ceramic pick up, plus storage space for six long-play records make up the unit." [...] A button controlled whether you listened to the radio or the records. A proprietary 0.25-mil (i.e., 0.00025" [...] or a quarter of a [...] "thou") stylus was used with an unusually high <b>stylus</b> <b>pressure</b> of two grams to prevent skipping or skating despite normal car vibrations.|$|E
5000|$|The {{turntable}} plinth has {{a precision}} 16 gauge steel stamped top plate. The base {{appears to be}} a heavy composite plastic material with steel bars or plates added for additional weight. The platter is die-cast aluminum having a thickness of 0.110". At the center of the underside of the platter a 3.520" [...] diameter, 0.210" [...] thick, ceramic magnetic ring bonded to the platter is used to magnetically secure the platter to a 3.800" [...] diameter steel plate on the spindle assembly. Two large finger holes in the platter are provided for lifting the platter off of the spindle. The platter and ceramic magnet assembly weighs 1.84 lbs. The integrated aluminum tonearm assembly includes the tonearm counterweight with <b>stylus</b> <b>pressure</b> ring, rest/clamp, lift lever, lift adjustment, plus calibrated anti-skate control, height, height lock, and tracking force adjustments. The tonearm rest/clamp and adjustment dials are plastic. The die-cast metal headshell is of the standard removable type. A generously sized LCD display on the Pro models indicates speed setting, play/pause, pitch, quartz lock, and direction of platter rotation. The ground wire and audio output leads are permanently attached. A removable, hinged plastic dust cover was included.|$|E

We outline the construction of the prototype and the principles behind the sensing method, which uses a cluster of four fibre-optic based deformation sensors. We propose interaction techniques using the FlexStylus to improve menu navigation and tool selection. Finally, we describe a study comparing users' ability to match a changing target value using a commercial <b>pressure</b> <b>stylus</b> and the FlexStylus' absolute deformation. When using the FlexStylus, users had a significantly higher accuracy overall. This suggests that deformation may be a useful input method for future work considering stylus augmentation...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Though {{there are}} a variety of {{graphics}} tablets, these do not necessarily allow an artist to interact with the computer as if handling traditional pens and brushes. A study of practising artists indicates that haptic and propriaptic feedback respectively of pen pressure and motion, together with a direct view of the image being created, is required. Flat-screen LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) technology now allows an artist to view an image while the stylus' spatial position is acquired. Through the use of ultrasonic sensors, position can be fixed without electronic interference from the display device, allowing an off-the-shelf LCD to be employed. Provision of other sensors in the <b>stylus,</b> such as <b>pressure,</b> acceleration, rotation, and tilt meters, replicate the experience of the artist when using a conventional drawing/painting method. The design of the interface has been accomplished, at a low cost, with a set of PIC microcontrollers [1] and standard ultrasonic sensors. 2...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} GaussSense, {{which is}} a back-of-device sensing technique for enabling input on an arbitrary surface using stylus by exploiting magnetism. A 2 mm-thick Hall sensor grid is developed to sense magnets that are embedded in the stylus. Our system can sense the magnetic field that is emitted from the stylus when it is within 2 cm of any nonferromagnetic surface. Attaching the sensor behind an arbitrary thin surface enables the stylus input to be recognized by analyzing {{the distribution of the}} applied magnetic field. Attaching the sensor grid to the back of a touchscreen device and incorporating magnets into the corresponding stylus enable the system 1) to distinguish touch events that are caused by a finger from those caused by the stylus, 2) to sense the tilt angle of the <b>stylus</b> and the <b>pressure</b> with which it is applied, and 3) to detect where the stylus hovers over the screen. A pilot study reveals that people were satisfied with the novel sketching experiences based on this system...|$|R
5000|$|After {{the initial}} launch the Numark units {{received}} mixed reviews, with several flaws and inadequate quality assurance being pointed out. Some found the tonearm as supplied was not accurately calibrated or properly {{aligned with the}} platter, {{but it can be}} tweaked and adjusted to perform well. The platter in some cases exhibited noticeable warp or axial run-out, which appears to be in part due to the ceramic ring magnetic that secures the platter to the spindle not being glued correctly to the underside of the platter. Some reviewers complained that the pitch system was not calibrated accurately, although not off by much. On later production models, probably the Pro TT-2 only, it is reported that access holes are provided {{on the bottom of the}} turntable base to permit pitch calibration using a screwdriver. Others considered the LCD display to be of little practical value since the pitch value shown is not precise. Also, in some cases the <b>stylus</b> <b>pressure</b> ring on the tonearm counterbalance weight assembly turns much too freely. And, unfortunately, the dust cover hinges eventually fail due to cracking at the bottom of the plastic housing for the counterbalance spring which is under the constant load of the stiff spring. One failed hinge keeps the dust cover from staying open when raised.|$|E
40|$|Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity impulsivity, or both. Although fine motor difficulties are frequently found in children diagnosed with ADHD, {{often they are}} not identified and are undertreated. The present study examined fine motor control in children with ADHD in several ways, including {{through the use of}} digitizing technology, and compared it to that of control children. Thirty-eight children with ADHD and 28 control children in grades four through eight were administered a measure of handwriting (Test of Handwriting Skills - Revised; THS-R), a pattern completion task (Repeated Patterns Test; RPT), and a measure of fine motor skills (Bruininks Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency - Second Edition; BOT- 2) on a digitizing tablet. Groups were compared on peak vertical velocity, variability of peak vertical velocity, normalized jerk, and mean <b>stylus</b> <b>pressure.</b> Results of the present study indicated that better quality of writing was associated with slower writing speed in children with ADHD, whereas in control children better quality writing was associated with greater <b>stylus</b> <b>pressure,</b> slower writing speed, and less variability in writing speed. No group differences were found on either a measure of fluency or <b>stylus</b> <b>pressure</b> when examining children 2 ̆ 7 s writing between different levels of constraint. Both groups demonstrated the most fluent writing between 2 cm spaced lines, which appear to represent a level that facilitates the maximal amount of writing fluency in children in grades four through eight.

40|$|The {{development}} of cobalt molybdenum and cobalt tungsten brush plating electrolytes is described. Their optimum compositions and operating conditions for commercial applications have been determined. The effects of composition, pH, applied voltage, <b>stylus</b> speed and <b>pressure</b> upon deposit composition and efficiency have been investigated. Transmission and Scanning Electron Microscopy have been employed {{to study the}} cobalt alloy deposits produced. Evaluation of the wear resistant properties of the cobalt alloys developed in this work {{was carried out in}} the laboratory using a pin and disc technique and a simulated hot forging test, and by industrial trials involving the "on site" plating of hot forging dies and cold pressing tools. It was concluded that the electrolytes developed in tl 1 is work enabled cobalt alloys containing 6 % Mo or 8 % W to be deposited at 17 - 20 V. Brush plated cobalt deposits possessed a mixed CPU and FCC crystallographic structure at room temperature. The application of 13 µm of either of the cobalt alloys resulted in improved wear performance in both pin and disc and simulated hot forging tests. The results of the industrial trials indicated that by the use of these alloys, the life of hot forging dies may be increased by 20 - 100 %. A commercial forging organisation is using electrolytes developed in this work to coat dies prior to forging nimonic alloys. Reductions in forging temperature and improved forging qualities have been reported. Cold pressing tools coated with the alloys showed a reduced tendency to "pick-up" and scoring of the pressed panels. Reports of a reduced need for lubrication of panels before pressing have also been received...|$|R

40|$|The {{inferred}} mode protocol {{is designed}} to determine a user’s intention in stylus interfaces {{with the goal of}} eliminating the mode problem. To accomplish this task, the system reasons using characteristics of a user’s action and features extracted from image material to determine whether a user’s gesture constitutes selection or inking. However, in many situations, uni-modal pen interfaces do not provide sufficient information to determine, unambiguously, a user’s intention. In this work, we describe our on-going research in the use of additional modalities to eliminate ambiguities that exist in the inferred mode protocol.
