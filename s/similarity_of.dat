5|$|The major {{difficulty}} in separation of actinium is the <b>similarity</b> <b>of</b> its properties {{with those of}} lanthanum. Thus actinium is either synthesized in nuclear reactions from isotopes of radium or separated using ion-exchange procedures.|$|E

5|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} metabolism is the <b>similarity</b> <b>of</b> the basic metabolic pathways and components between even vastly different species. For example, {{the set of}} carboxylic acids that are {{best known as the}} intermediates in the citric acid cycle are present in all known organisms, being found in species as diverse as the unicellular bacterium Escherichia coli and huge multicellular organisms like elephants. These striking similarities in metabolic pathways are likely due to their early appearance in evolutionary history, and their retention because of their efficacy.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the turn}} of the millennium, the Arabic {{astronomer}} and polymath Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) presented a development of Ptolemy's geocentric epicyclic models in terms of nested spheres. Despite the <b>similarity</b> <b>of</b> this concept to that of Ptolemy's Planetary Hypotheses, al-Haytham's presentation differs in sufficient detail that {{it has been argued that}} it reflects an independent development of the concept. In chapters 15–16 of his Book of Optics, Ibn al-Haytham also said that the celestial spheres do not consist of solid matter.|$|E

5|$|Lanthanum is an {{essential}} cofactor for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, although the great chemical <b>similarity</b> <b>of</b> the lanthanides means {{that it may be}} substituted with cerium, praseodymium, or neodymium without ill effects, and with the smaller samarium, europium, or gadolinium giving no side effects other than slower growth.|$|E

In 1890, Karl Moritz Schumann created the new genus Zygocactus, transferring Epiphyllum truncatum to Zygocactus truncatus. Although he later placed it back in Epiphyllum, abandoning Zygocactus, the generic name Zygocactus continued to be widely used.|$|E

5|$|Like the lanthanides, all {{actinides}} {{are highly}} reactive with halogens and chalcogens; however, the actinides react more easily. Actinides, {{especially those with}} {{a small number of}} 5f-electrons, are prone to hybridization. This is explained by the <b>similarity</b> <b>of</b> the electron energies at the 5f, 7s and 6d shells. Most actinides exhibit a larger variety of valence states, and the most stable are +6 for uranium, +5 for protactinium and neptunium, +4 for thorium and plutonium and +3 for actinium and other actinides.|$|E
5|$|More {{recently}} still, Trollope {{scholars have}} looked upon it with increasing favour, describing it {{as a powerful}} work that has suffered undeserved neglect. Present-day critics have focussed increasingly on the Carry Brattle subplot; it has been suggested, {{supported in part by}} the <b>similarity</b> <b>of</b> passages from The Vicar, from the Autobiography, and from The Small House at Allington referring to Johnny Eames, that some aspects of her portrayal are based on the novelist's own early adulthood in London.|$|E
5|$|Section 8 was amended in 1820, 1835, and 1846 and codified in five {{sections}} of the Revised Statutes. Further, § 8 was supplemented by additional prohibitions in § 5 of an 1819 act and § 3 of an 1820 act. Despite the <b>similarity</b> <b>of</b> the provisions, all three were all separately codified in the Revised Statutes in 1874. Section 8 was repealed by the Criminal Code of 1909. Section 8's venue provision was re-enacted by § 14 of the Crimes Act of 1825, with minor changes.|$|E

5|$|Swedish naturalist Daniel Solander, after {{collecting}} {{a specimen}} at Botany Bay in 1770 {{on the first}} voyage of Captain James Cook, {{was the first to}} write of this species.

5|$|Termites, {{although}} {{sometimes called}} 'white ants', are not ants. They {{belong to the}} sub-order Isoptera within the order Blattodea. Termites are {{more closely related to}} cockroaches and mantids. Termites are eusocial, but differ greatly in the genetics of reproduction. The <b>similarity</b> <b>of</b> their social structure to that of ants is attributed to convergent evolution. Velvet ants look like large ants, but are wingless female wasps.|$|E
5|$|The {{amino acid}} lycoperdic acid (chemical name 3-(5(S)-carboxy-2-oxotetrahydrofuran-5(S)-yl)-2(S)-alanine) was {{isolated}} from the puffball, and reported in a 1978 publication. Based on the structural <b>similarity</b> <b>of</b> the new amino acid with (S)-glutamic acid, (S)-(+)-lycoperdic acid {{is expected to have}} antagonistic or agonistic activity for the glutamate receptor in the mammalian central nervous system. Methods to synthesize the compounds were reported in 1992, 1995, and 2002.|$|E

5|$|The {{species was}} {{originally}} described from California as Armillaria olida by mycologists Harry D. Thiers and Walter Sundberg in 1976. The type specimen was collected on May 6, 1972, in the Crystal Basin Recreation Area in El Dorado County. Thiers and Sundberg classified {{it in the}} section Ponderosa of genus Armillaria due to its inamyloid spores, but noted that its relationship to other species was unclear. They also noted the <b>similarity</b> <b>of</b> the form and color of its cap to species in section Constricta of genus Lyophyllum.|$|E
5|$|A {{direct method}} for {{producing}} an MSA uses the dynamic programming technique {{to identify the}} globally optimal alignment solution. For proteins, this method usually involves two sets of parameters: a gap penalty and a substitution matrix assigning scores or probabilities to the alignment of each possible pair of amino acids based on the <b>similarity</b> <b>of</b> the amino acids' chemical properties and the evolutionary probability of the mutation. For nucleotide sequences a similar gap penalty is used, but a much simpler substitution matrix, wherein only identical matches and mismatches are considered, is typical. The scores in the substitution matrix may be either all positive or a mix {{of positive and negative}} {{in the case of a}} global alignment, but must be both positive and negative, in the case of a local alignment.|$|E
