40|$|This paper {{describes}} a high-level multi-HDL design process applied to an industrial {{design of a}} <b>single</b> <b>chip</b> Videophone <b>Codec.</b> It makes use of many state-of-the-art design tools and methods: • Behavioural VHDL control path synthesis for the controller of the Codec motion estimator. • Behavioural DSP synthesis from Silage to generate an application-specific calculation unit that performs vector prediction for the motion estimator. • Retargetable C compilation for an embedded application-specific microcontroller. • Multi-level (behavioural, RTL, gate) and multi-language (VHDL, Silage, C) co-simulation. We will show that, {{with respect to a}} manual design process, the use of these tools led to the following results: • A five-fold reduction in the source HDL description complexity. • Equal or better timing performance. • Silicon area within 15 % (4 % area overhead for the DSP operator, and 14 % overhead for the controller). • Automatically compiled assembly code (from ANSI C descriptions) that is as compact as hand-coded assembler. We also identified a strong need to pay attention to design verification issues, especially when dealing with multi-level descriptions and multiple languages. Validation of the design was the single most time consuming part of the process...|$|R
