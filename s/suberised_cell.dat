40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} early cyto-histological events associated with the reduced number of shoots formed at the end of culture in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) thin cell layers treated with methyl jasmonate (MJ) [S. Biondi et al. (2001) J Exp Bot 52 : 1 - 12]. The results show that 0. 1 - 10 muM MJ strongly stimulated mitotic activity early in culture relative to untreated controls. Treatment with MJ also induced anomalous mitoses. Enhanced proliferative growth was confirmed by northern analysis and in situ hybridisation using cDNA probes of the G 1 /S phase-specific genes ubiquitin carboxyl-extension protein (ubi-CEP), topoisomerase 1 (top 1) and ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). The formation of meristematic cell clusters on day 5 was also enhanced by 1 muM MJ, but subsequent development of these cell clusters into meristemoids and shoot primordia was reduced by all MJ concentrations in a dose-dependent manner. Cell expansion was stimulated by MJ concentrations ranging from 0. 001 to 10 muM; expanded cells frequently occurred around and within meristemoids and shoot primordia, and displayed thickened and <b>suberised</b> <b>cell</b> walls; cell wall thickness increased with increasing MJ concentration. These cytological events caused alterations in the tunica and stem differentiation of the shoot dome. The apparently paradoxical role of MJ, which deregulates shoot formation through a stimulation of growth events, i. e., mitotic activity and cell expansion, is discussed...|$|E
50|$|Suberin {{is found}} in the phellem layer of the {{periderm}} (or cork). This is outermost layer of the bark. The cells in this layer are dead and abundant in suberin, preventing water loss from the tissues below. Suberin can also be found in various other plant structures. For example, they are present in the lenticels on the stems of many plants and the net structure in the rind of a netted melon is composed of <b>suberised</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the pathway used by Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands {{to penetrate the}} bark of jarrah, the present study describes unwounded periderm and rhytidome development. Periderm formation is described from its initiation in 4 -week-old seedlings {{to the formation of}} rhytidome in saplings. Periderm in young seedlings consists of a single type of phellem, namely thin-walled <b>suberised</b> <b>cells.</b> In older seedlings where multiple layers of periderm have formed, layers of thick-walled lignified phellem cells in compacted bands alternate with thin-walled <b>suberised</b> <b>cells.</b> Rhytidome formation in older lignotuberous seedlings and in sapling jarrah occurs through the isolation of secondary phloem by periderm. The rhytidome consists of expanded and partially disintegrated secondary phloem tissue sandwiched between layers of phellem cells. Localised periderm formation beneath stomata results in the formation of lenticels, which are ephemeral features. Superficial periderms occur at sites of leaf and shoot abscission, and of lateral shoot emergence. Concealed axillary shoots lack cuticle on emergence. As the trees age, the internal production of lignified and suberised periderm and rhytidome results in an impenetrable barrier to invasion by P. cinnamomi. However, external sites including lenticels and leaf and shoot abscission and emergence areas, all provide points of ingress in unwounded stems...|$|R
30|$|The cork of Quercus variabilis shows typical {{structural}} and chemical features of bark cork tissues {{with a regular}} structure of radially aligned <b>suberised</b> <b>cells</b> without intercellular voids. These characteristics support its use as a cellular material namely for sealing, insulation and energy absorption. However, and taking as reference the cork from Q. suber, the cells of Q. variabilis are smaller, the solid volume fraction is higher, the structure more heterogeneous at tissue and cell level, and the overall quality lower. The negative impact of these characteristics should be evaluated for processing and product performance.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{explore a}} {{detailed}} pharmacognostic {{study of the}} rhizome of Hedychium spicatum Ham-ex-Smith (Zingiberaceae), a plant species which is commonly used in preparation of indigenous medicine. Methods: The macroscopy, microscopy, quantitative analysis, extractive values in ethanol and water, phytochemical screening, TLC and HPTLC of aqueous and ethanolic extract and DNA fingerprint of the rhizome were investigated. Results: Rhizome appeared to be 15 - 20 cm long, 20 - 25 mm in diameter, light-brown with 4 - 6 nodules. Transverse section of rhizome showed an outermost thick layer of <b>suberised,</b> dark brown <b>cells</b> in outer cork with 10 or more layers of irregular parenchymatous cells. Inner cork consisted of a few layered light brown rectangular radially arranged cells, followed by a wide zone of cortex having 30 - 40 cell layers. Rhizome powder was light brown in colour, bitter having camphorous odour, and fibrous texture. Alkaloids, carbohydrates, proteins, resins, saponins, steroid, tannin, starch and glycosides were present in both extracts while, flavonoids and triterpenoids were present only in ethanolic extract. TLC, HPTLC and DNA fingerprinting confirmed the chemical composition present in rhizome. Conclusions: The pharmacognostic profile of Hedychium spicatum rhizome is helpful in sample identification, quality and purity standards...|$|R
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Florestal e dos Recursos Naturais - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe bark of 5 {{trees of}} E. nitens with 4 and 10 {{years of age}}, and 5 trees of E. rudis with 4 years of age was analyzed. The {{qualitative}} characterization and {{the determination of the}} tissue proportions were made on histological thin sections and quantitative characterization on dissociated elements; the dimension of fibres, axial parenchyma and expanded cells was also determined. The species showed: reduced rhytidome, periderm composed by phellem with <b>suberised</b> and lignified <b>cells</b> and phelloderm; non-collapsed phloem with tangential layers with axial parenchyma alternating with sieve tube elements and fibre bundles; the collapsed phloem is characterized by the change of the parenchyma cells and sclereids. The length, width and wall thickness of fibers was in 4 -year-old E. nitens 0. 90 mm; 16. 2 μm and 4. 7 μm; in 10 -year-old E. nitens 1. 05 mm; 17. 8 μm and 5. 2 μm and E. rudis 0. 84 mm; 21 μm and 6 μm respectively. The expanded axial parenchyma cells are the most abundant phloem tissue (38 - 48 %) in both species; the percentage of fibers was higher in E. nitens (33 %). The species differed in the type of periderm, in the arrangement of the expanded cells and in the occurrence of secretory cavities...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{losses of}} potato tubers in storage due to soft rot spoilage have emphasised {{the need for}} detailed studies of the entry and spread of the pathogen and {{the action of the}} defence mechanisms of the potato at an ultrastruotiiral level. The {{studies have shown that the}} tuber may be infected through fresh wounds or lenticels under conditions of high relative humidity, providing sufficient inoculum is present and, in the case of lenticels, the conditions before inoculation have been suitable. The effects of the environment on the physical barriers and consequently bacterial spread are complex. Observation of the formation of suberin and melanin at the infection interface hafe shown that the former may hinder bacterial spread: the role of the latter is more obscure. Light microscopy has shown that the pattern of initial colonisation is highly temperature dependant. Colonisation through lenticels is quicker at first than through fresh wounds probably due to the differences in anatomy, although quantitatively large amounts of inoculum are involved in the latter under most conditions. Once inside the tuber the bacterium spreads through the storage parenchyma as zoned colonies aligned in one direction during the early stages, but after the host cells have been macerated the cells of the pathogen become uniformly distributed between the pcl&tc cells. Vascular spread is less common, and the bacteria are enclosed in the xylem and phloem by the <b>suberised,</b> closely packed <b>cells</b> of the vascular parenchyma, although some pectolysis and subsequent melanin formation occurs outside the bundles for distances of up to 500 u. Tissue degradation involves the destruction of the cytoplasm, as well as the cell wall. Characteristically membrane rupture is associated with the enlargement of microbodies. Although cells containing calcium oxalate monohydrate are colonised intracellularly, the crystals do not appear to be utilised. The significance of these findings in relation to the disease as a whole are discussed, and possible practical implications for the grower and user of potatoes are considered...|$|R
