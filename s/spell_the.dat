40|$|We compare {{a variety}} of {{strategies}} for incorporating spelling to create more robust voice-only speech interfaces. These strategies use different combinations of speaking <b>the</b> word, <b>spelling</b> <b>the</b> word, and <b>spelling</b> <b>the</b> word using a phonetic alphabet. For correcting a single recognition error, <b>spelling</b> <b>the</b> word or speaking and <b>spelling</b> <b>the</b> word reduced error rates substantially. Phonetic-spelling was very accurate with error rates on a 5 K task approaching zero. Most importantly, multiple input strategies can be used simultaneously with only a modest degradation in performance compared to allowing only a single input strategy. Thus our work shows that spelling-based input strategies offer the potential of a simple, natural and effective way for users to both avoid and correct recognition errors.

5|$|Murrell used witch bottles {{as part of}} his magical practices, and, {{during the}} 1950s, the folklorist Eric Maple {{encountered}} claims that Murrell was able to summon anyone he wished using them, including individuals who had gone overseas. Murrell experimented {{with the use of a}} witch bottle constructed out of iron; he had two such devices created by a local smith, Stephen Choppen, and had the plug at the mouth soldered up before the bottle was placed in a fire as part of an anti-bewitchment <b>spell.</b> <b>The</b> idea behind this was that the bottle itself would not explode under the heat, and that thus it could be reused on other occasions. According to folklore collected by Maple, the smith's attempts, which were initially unsuccessful, succeeded only after Murrell had recited a charm.|$|E

5|$|Barton {{was born}} and raised in Huyton, Merseyside. He began his {{football}} career with Manchester City in 2002 after working his way through their youth system. His appearances in the first team gradually increased over the following five years and he made more than 150 for the club. He earned his first cap for the England national team in February 2007, despite his criticism of some of the team's players. He then joined Newcastle United for a fee of £5.8million in July 2007. After four years with the club, he joined Queens Park Rangers in August 2011, from where he was loaned to Marseille in 2012. He returned from his loan <b>spell</b> <b>the</b> following season, and helped QPR to promotion to the Premier League via the Championship play-offs. However, QPR were relegated again, and Barton was released at the end of the season. He signed a one-year deal to play for Burnley in 2015, helping them win promotion to the Premier League, but left to join Rangers in May 2016.|$|E

5|$|Born in Ashford, Kent, Fuller {{was spotted}} playing for his local club, Kennington Juniors FC, by Premier League side Charlton Athletic who signed him to their youth Academy {{at the age}} of thirteen. The full-back progressed through the Addicks' Academy up until the age of nineteen, signing his first {{professional}} contract on 1 July 2004. On 17 July 2004, he featured for Charlton Athletic in a pre-season friendly win over Kent League side Sittingbourne; he scored in the 83rd minute to confirm a 3–0 win following a brace by fellow youngster Lloyd Sam. The young right-back was selected to captain Charlton Athletic's Reserves side during the 2004–05 season, helping the club to finish as Champions of the Premier Reserve League Southern Division. He also represented Charlton in the first ever Premier Reserve League Shield national play-off final on 12 May 2005, which saw Northern Division champions Manchester United Reserves beat the Addicks 4–2 at The Valley. Despite his success with the Reserves, however, he failed to break into the first team and was subsequently loaned out to League Two side Barnet on an initial one-month deal on 12 January 2006. The 21-year-old defender made his Football League debut on 14 January 2006 in a 4–1 defeat by Lincoln City. On 15 February 2006, it was announced that he would remain with Barnet for a further month. On 18 March 2006, he scored his first Football League goal in a 2–2 draw with Peterborough United. On 24 March 2006, Barnet manager Paul Fairclough extended Fuller's loan for a third and final time up until 22 April. He played his final game for the Bees on 22 April 2006 in a 0–0 draw with Chester City before subsequently returning to Charlton Athletic. In total, he made fifteen league appearances for Barnet during the 2005–06 season, which proved to be a vital contribution in helping the club avoid relegation from the Football League. Despite impressing on his loan <b>spell,</b> <b>the</b> 20-year-old defender was released by Charlton Athletic manager Alan Curbishley {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Fagan's {{retirement}} in May 1985 and Dalglish's subsequent promotion to player-manager meant {{that instead of}} gradually succeeding Dalglish as Liverpool's main striker Walsh instead {{had to contend with}} a rival for his position as the club's manager. He missed 1985–86 pre-season after undergoing a hernia operation. He returned to fitness against Oxford United on 14 September, but had a bitter argument with Dalglish at half-time which initially seemed to <b>spell</b> <b>the</b> end to his Liverpool career as he was placed on the transfer list. He returned to the first team though and was taken off the transfer list by his own request and soon entered a scoring streak, though his form was ended after he ruptured his ankle ligaments in a collision with Manchester United's Kevin Moran on 9 February. He returned to action six weeks later but continued to suffer with ankle trouble and was ruled out {{for the rest of the}} season, ending the campaign with 18 goals in 32 appearances in all competitions throughout the campaign. His injury caused him to miss the 1986 FA Cup Final, though he secured a First Division winners medal as Liverpool won the league by a two-point margin over Everton. His contribution to the club's success was not forgotten as he was named in the First Division's PFA Team of the Year, alongside teammate Mark Lawrenson.|$|E
5|$|The Mysterium Tech (or MysTech) {{system allows}} players to use in-game objects collectively known as MysTech, {{and create new}} MysTech by using a {{configuration}} screen accessed through Elementor Host items. MysTech cannot be used until they are awakened after a certain story event. Eight basic colors of MysTech exist, representing different elements; for example, green represents poison. Players can use MysTech to inflict damage upon enemies, plague them with certain status effects (such as freezing them in place), or heal party members. Casting status effect-MysTech on party members will cure them if afflicted by enemy status spells. MysTech slabs and Elementor Hosts can be found as treasure in the game world or bought from shops. To create MysTech, players place colored bugs (found on small hills in several game locations) in empty slots on an Elementor Host. The color of bugs placed in the function slot determines the color of MysTech, while other slots modify the power and/or range of the spell. Players can add special bugs known as Cobalt Crawlers to make a spell target all enemies instead of one; a Host filled with eight Crawlers unlocks a secret <b>spell.</b> <b>The</b> effect of bugs can be amplified by feeding them petals from Lifeflowers, {{which can be found}} scattered throughout the world of Anachronox. Special types of Hosts with two or three different functions allow players to pick which MysTech function to use in battle.|$|E

5|$|The {{manner in}} which the puffball splits open (dehisces) has been {{described}} by 19th-century American mycologist William Henry Long. The thick and leathery peridium of the mature puffball remains unopened for several months without splitting. After several alternating cycles of wetting and drying, fissures develop across the top. These fissures usually radiate from a common center {{near the top of the}} fruit body and finally produce very irregular star-like teeth. In time, the entire upper half of the puffball is open and exposed during dry weather. In this condition, the spores are blown out by the wind and widely distributed. During every rainy <b>spell</b> <b>the</b> puffball promptly closes only to open again when dry weather returns. At each alternate opening and closing the peridium is split more and more, until finally it is expanded into a flat shape, or even curls backward. In the puffball, the outer layer of the peridium comprises cells arranged so that when wet they adsorb water and expand, thus closing the top of the puffball. Upon drying, these outer cells lose water and gradually shrink, thus producing an unequal tension between the outer and inner cells of the peridium. This tension causes the irregular star-like pieces of the peridium to gradually separate and curve outward, thus opening the top of the puffball during dry weather.|$|E
