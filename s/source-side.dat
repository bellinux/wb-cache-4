40|$|This paper {{presents}} a reordering frame-work for {{statistical machine translation}} (SMT) where <b>source-side</b> reorderings are integrated into SMT decoding, allowing for a highly constrained reordered search graph. The monotone search is extended {{by means of a}} set of reordering patterns (linguistically motivated rewrite patterns). Patterns are automatically learnt in train-ing from word-to-word alignments and <b>source-side</b> Part-Of-Speech (POS) tags. Traversing the extended search graph, the decoder evaluates every hypothesis making use of a group of widely used SMT models and helped by an addi-tional Ngram language model of <b>source-side</b> POS tags. Experiments are reported on the Euparl task (Spanish-to-English and English-to-Spanish). Results are presented regard-ing translation accuracy (using human and automatic evaluations) and computational efciency, showing signicant improve-ments in translation quality for both trans-lation directions at a very low computa-tional cost. ...|$|E

40|$|Pre-reordering, a {{preprocessing}} to {{make the}} <b>source-side</b> word orders close {{to those of the}} target side, has been proven very helpful for statistical machine translation (SMT) in improving translation quality. However, is it the case in neural machine translation (NMT) ? In this paper, we firstly investigate the impact of pre-reordered <b>source-side</b> data on NMT, and then propose to incorporate features for the pre-reordering model in SMT as input factors into NMT (factored NMT). The features, namely parts-of-speech (POS), word class and reordered index, are encoded as feature vectors and concatenated to the word embeddings to provide extra knowledge for NMT. Pre-reordering experiments conducted on Japanese↔English and Chinese↔English show that pre-reordering the <b>source-side</b> data for NMT is redundant and NMT models trained on pre-reordered data deteriorate translation performance. However, factored NMT using SMT-based pre-reordering features on Japanese→English and Chinese→English is beneficial and can further improve by 4. 48 and 5. 89 relative BLEU points, respectively, compared to the baseline NMT system...|$|E

We also in-troduce a random walk style algorithm to collectively identify translations of <b>source-side</b> content words that are strongly related in translation graph. We validate the ef-fectiveness of our lexical selection frame-work on Chinese-English translation.

40|$|We {{present a}} phrase-based {{extension}} to memory-based machine translation. This form of examplebased machine translation employs lazy-learning classifiers to translate {{fragments of the}} source sentence to fragments of the target sentence. <b>Source-side</b> fragments consist of variable-length phrases in a local context of neighboring words, translated by the classifier to a target-language phrase. We compare three methods of phrase extraction, and present a new decoder that reassembles the translated fragments into one final translation. Results show {{that one of the}} proposed phrase-extraction methods—the one used in Moses—leads to a translation system that outperforms context-sensitive word-based approaches. The differences, however, are small, arguably because the word-based approaches already capture phrasal context implicitly due to their <b>source-side</b> and target-side context sensitivity. ...|$|E

40|$|Machine {{translation}} aims {{to generate}} a target sentence that is semantically equivalent to the source sentence. However, most of current statistical machine translation models do not model the semantics of sentences. In this paper, we propose a novel translation framework based on predicate-argument structure (PAS) for its capacity on grasping the semantics and skeleton structure of sentences. By using PAS, the framework effectively models both semantics of languages and global reordering for translation. In the framework, we divide the translation process into 3 steps: (1) PAS acquisition: perform semantic role labeling (SRL) on the input sentences to acquire <b>source-side</b> PASs; (2) Transformation: convert <b>source-side</b> PASs to their target counterparts by predicate-aware PAS transformation rules; (3) Translation: first translate the predicate and arguments of PAS and then adopt a CKY-style decoding algorithm to translate the entire PAS. Experimental results show that our PAS-based translation framework significantly improves the translation performance...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a reordering model us-ing syntactic information of a source tree for phrase-based statistical machine translation. The proposed model {{is an extension}} of IST-ITG (imposing source tree on inversion trans-duction grammar) constraints. In the pro-posed method, the target-side word order is obtained by rotating nodes of the <b>source-side</b> parse-tree. We modeled the node rotation, monotone or swap, using word alignments based on a training parallel corpus and <b>source-side</b> parse-trees. The model efficiently sup-presses erroneous target word orderings, espe-cially global orderings. Furthermore, the pro-posed method conducts a probabilistic evalu-ation of target word reorderings. In English-to-Japanese and English-to-Chinese transla-tion experiments, the proposed method re-sulted in a 0. 49 -point improvement (29. 31 to 29. 80) and a 0. 33 -point improvement (18. 60 to 18. 93) in word BLEU- 4 compared with IST-ITG constraints, respectively.

40|$|Inspired by {{previous}} <b>source-side</b> syntactic reordering methods for SMT, this paper focuses on using automatically learned syntactic reordering patterns with functional words which indicate structural reorderings between {{the source and}} target language. This approach takes advantage of phrase alignments and <b>source-side</b> parse trees for pattern extraction, and then filters out those patterns without functional words. Word lattices transformed by the generated patterns are fed into PB-SMT systems to incorporate potential reorderings from the inputs. Experiments are carried out on a medium-sized corpus for a Chinese–English SMT task. The proposed method outperforms the baseline system by 1. 38 % relative on a randomly selected testset and 10. 45 % relative on the NIST 2008 testset in terms of BLEU score. Furthermore, a system with just 61. 88 % of the patterns filtered by functional words obtains a comparable performance with the unfiltered one on the randomly selected testset, and achieves 1. 74 % relative improvements on the NIST 2008 testset. ...|$|E
40|$|Cross-lingual {{learning}} {{has become a}} popu-lar approach to facilitate the development of resources and tools for low-density lan-guages. Its underlying idea is {{to make use of}} existing tools and annotations in resource-rich languages to create similar tools and resources for resource-poor lan-guages. Typically, this is achieved by either projecting annotations across parallel cor-pora, or by transferring models from one or more source languages to a target language. In this paper, we explore a third strategy by using machine translation to create syn-thetic training data from the original <b>source-side</b> annotations. Specifically, we apply this technique to dependency parsing, us-ing a cross-lingually unified treebank for adequate evaluation. Our approach draws on annotation projection but avoids the use of noisy <b>source-side</b> annotation of an unre-lated parallel corpus and instead relies on manual treebank annotation in combination with statistical machine translation, which makes it possible to train fully lexicalized parsers. We show that this approach signif-icantly outperforms delexicalized transfer parsing. ...|$|E

An advantage of this method {{is that there is}} no need to pick the horizontal reflectors prior to migration of the prism waves. It also separately images the vertical structures at a different step to reduce crosstalk interference. The disadvantage of prism wave migration algorithm is that its computational cost is twice that of conventional RTM.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new hypothesis alignment method for combining outputs of multiple machine translation (MT) systems.

In this paper, a <b>source-side</b> context-informed (SSCI) hypothesis alignment method is proposed {{to carry out the}} word alignment and word reordering issues. First of all, the source–target word alignment links are produced as the hidden variables by exporting source phrase spans during the translation decoding process. Secondly, a mapping strategy and normalisation model are employed to acquire the 1 - to- 1 alignment links and build the confusion network (CN). The <b>source-side</b> context-based method outperforms the state-of-the-art TERbased alignment model in our experiments on the WMT 09 English-to-French and NIST Chinese-to-English data sets respectively.
