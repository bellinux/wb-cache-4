40|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} of airborne interferometric {{synthetic aperture radar}} is a relatively narrow swath compared to analogous space based systems. Increasing the swath with side view of the interferometer can be possible by increasing the flight altitude and angle of sight.

40|$|Abstract—Large path {{losses of}} {{millimeter}} waves restrain {{the acceptance of}} 60 GHz technology in future networks. Directional antennas can be exploited in 60 GHz networks to mitigate the detrimental impact of fading. Employing fully directional antennas complicates the neighbor discovery process where each sector must be probed individually to discover neighbors located in that sector. In random scanning strategy, nodes select to-be-scanned sector randomly. In this letter, we analyze the minimum number of random <b>sector</b> <b>scanning</b> attempts during neighbor discovery process to have a non-isolated network. We present an analytical model to study the isolation probability defined as probability of having at least one isolated node in the network. Based on the isolation probability, we derive the minimum number of <b>sector</b> <b>scanning</b> attempts in a 60 GHz ad hoc network with arbitrary number of nodes.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{consider}} the problem of determining efficient scanning strategies for adaptive networks of radars used to monitor meteorological events. While most meteorological radars traditionally scan 360 degrees, repeatedly, more accurate readings can be obtained if adaptive <b>sector</b> <b>scanning</b> is performed. We propose a scanning strategy based on analyzing eigenimages computed given a set of observed radar images. These eigenimages allow us to identify spatial regions with high radar measurement variance, and thus provide us with the necessary information to reconfigure radar resources towards regions where the storms ’ states seem to be changing the fastest. These are exactly the regions where newer and more accurate readings are usually necessary. We show that performing adaptive reading in this manner provides gains over the traditional sit-and-spin approach, and also over a baseline random scanning strategy. We also {{show that there is}} a difficult trade-off between the minimum size of storm that one might want to track, and the capability of saving scanning resources by not focusing on irrelevant sectors. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{acoustic}} imaging technology {{is widely used}} for medical purposes and underwater imaging. In this work, an ultrasonic phased array device is developed by using piezoelectric transducers to provide autonomous navigation for robots and mobility aid for visually impaired people. To perform {{acoustic imaging}}, two different linear transducer arrays are composed with phase-delay focusing phenomenon in order to detect proximate objects with no mechanical scanning. The requirement of half wavelength spacing can not be satisfied between elements, because of using general purpose transducers. The transmitter array is formed by aligning the transducers with minimum spacing between them, which is 2. 11 times of the wavelength. This placement strategy leads to the occurrence of unwanted grating lobes in the array response. To eliminate these grating lobes, the receiver array is formed with a different spacing between each transducer. By forming the receiver array and the transmitter array non-identical, the directivity pattern for both arrays become different. The off-alignment between two arrays causes the grating lobes to appear at different places. Since the overall gain {{of the system is}} the product of receiver gain and transmitter gain, the grating lobes diminish for the overall system. The developed phased array device can transmit/receive ultrasonic waves to/from the arbitrary front directions using electronic <b>sector</b> <b>scanning</b> circuits.

Ultrasonographic evaluations were performed with a 3. 5 -MHz <b>sector</b> <b>scanning</b> transducer that was placed parallel to the long axis of the horse (longitudinal imaging) over {{an area of the}} left ventral aspect of the abdomen. The boundaries of the evaluated region included the ventral midline, 2 vertical lines {{at the level of the}} left 10 th and 17 th intercostal spaces, and a horizontal line between the 2 vertical lines at the level of the costal arch of the left 10 th intercostal area. RESULTS: In all horses, nonsacculated large colon was identified ultrasonographically in the left ventral portion of the abdomen; this finding was considered indicative of LCV. In 3 horses, the LCV involved intestinal rotation of 180 degrees, whereas in 1 horse, the LCV involved intestinal rotation of 540 degrees. As confirmed by surgical or postmortem findings, the degree and location of the volvulus were correctly estimated from ultrasonographic images. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: In horses, this method of diagnosis of LCV appears to be of value regardless of the location at which the rotation of the large colon occurs. Ultrasonographic findings may aid in the earlier diagnosis of LCV in horses, especially at an early stage of the disease when other clinical signs are equivocal...|$|E

40|$|Abstract − A hydroacoustic {{monitoring}} program for migratory herring {{was conducted in}} Drogden Channel, near Copenhagen, Denmark, beginning in June, 1996. Using installations of 100 -kHz sidescan sonar oriented across the channel, herring schools were observed at ranges up to 500 m in water depths of 10 – 14 m. In October 1997, this effort was supplemented with a 12 -kHz sidescan mounted on a motorized tripod allowing azimuthal <b>sector</b> <b>scanning.</b> This 12 -kHz sidescan was able to detect herring schools up to a 1 200 -m range. Two examples are examined to assess the limits of herring school detectability and the feasibility of abundance estimation. In both cases, herring schools are detectable by their transience and up to 20 dB signal excess relative to the nominally stationary background reverberation, dominated by seabed backscattering. Attempts are made to extract quantitative abundance estimates using methods based on school size and density, and through quantitative echo-integration. Acoustic ray tracing {{was found to be}} useful in interpreting the results, and in particular modeling boundary-reflection focusing as a potential source of positive bias in herring abundance estimates. © 2000 Ifremer/CNRS/INRA/IRD/Cemagref/Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS herring schools / sidescan sonar / acoustic ray-tracing Résumé − Détection de harengs en migration dans un détroit peu profond au moyen de sonars latéraux de 12 et 100 kHz.

40|$|Plaice {{fitted with}} 300 kHz {{acoustic}} transponding tags were tracked by <b>sector</b> <b>scanning</b> sonar off the East Anglian coast for periods up to 54 h and over distances up to 61 km. Using horizontal (plan) and vertical (elevation) scanning, the tracking technique enabled a fish {{to be positioned}} to within ± 2 - 5 m in range and 1 ° in bearing from the research ship, and to within ± 1 m in depth. The position of the research vessel was determined by reference to the Decca Navigator system with a maximum variable error of ± 45 m by day and ± 90 m by night. After release a fish was kept under continual surveillance and a complete record of its movements in the sea was reconstructed from the sonar data recorded during the track. Water current measurements were made during some tracks. Plaice which moved more than 15 km usually came off the bottom at slack water, moved downstream with the tide in midwater {{and returned to the}} bottom at the next slack water. When on the bottom the fish showed little or no movement during the opposing tide. The semi-diurnal (12 h period) vertical movements were clearly related to the tidal cycle, ascents being more closely linked to slack water than descents. The regular pattern of behaviour- here called selective tidal stream transport- could provide a quick and economical means of movement for fish on mi-gration through areas with strong tides. The observations are discussed in relation to the results obtained when midwater trawling for plaice along the line of their migration route in the Southern Bight of the North Sea. Other aspects of plaice behaviour observed during the tracking are dis-cussed in relation to ship's noise, weather, bottom topography, the energy cost of migration, sensory clues initiating and controlling migration, orientation in midwater, and the development of telemetering acoustic tags...|$|E

In support of this program, the MVCO has been subject to an intensive site survey program, involving, since early 2001 : (1) three swath backscatter and/or bathymetry surveys; (2) three high resolution seismic surveys; (3) ultra-high resolution sector-scanning sonar on pole mounts; (4) in situ geotechnical (velocity and resistivity) measurements, (5) grab sampling, and (6) vibracoring. These efforts are concentrated in water depths between 8 and 18 m, centered {{on the site of}} the MVCO permanent node at 12 m water depth Rippled scour depressions (RSDs) are pervasive within the MVCO. RSDs are shore-perpendicular bands of coarse sands separated by overlying fine sands. The term itself implies that the coarse sands are heavily rippled (0. 5 - 1 m wavelength, 0. 1 m amplitude) and slightly depressed relative to the fine sands which, in the MVCO, are generally just a few 102 ̆ 7 s of cm thick. The RSDs are clearly evident on sidescan data as bands of high backscatter. For the most part, grain size measurements confirm a strong positive correspondence between mean grain size and backscatter intensity. However, a critical exception is seen in deeper water where, well within the area of fine sands, backscatter increases noticeably as mean grain size decreases from 150 μ to 130 μ. Topographic expression related to the RSDs is confined primarily to evident scour depressions at the edges. The RSDs are highly asymmetric: backscatter is higher, the coarse/fine transition is more sharply defined, and the scour depression is deeper on one side than the other. This pattern changes within the survey: the higher backscatter edge is always to the west in the western part of the survey, and vice versa to the east. The strike of the RSDs also changes, from being slightly east of north in the western part of the survey to slightly west of north to the east. The MVCO site survey work establishes a baseline set of observations against which physical changes in the seafloor with time can be measured. Early evidence of significant change has been provided by comparison of the first two sidescan surveys, which indicates a shift in the RSD boundaries by as much as 50 m between February and September of 2001. Continued seafloor evolution is evidenced by the August 2002 grab sampling and <b>sector</b> <b>scanning</b> sonar.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the applicability of conventional 2 -D displacement and strain imaging techniques to phased array radiofrequency (RF) data. Furthermore, the possible advantages of aligning and stretching techniques for the reduction of decorrelation artefacts was examined. Data from both realistic simulations and phantoms were used in this study. Recently, the used processing concepts were successfully applied to linear array data. However, their applicability to <b>sector</b> <b>scan</b> data is not trivial because of the polar grid. Homogeneous and inhomogeneous tissue phantoms were simulated at a range of strains (0 to 5 %) using Field II((c)). The inhomogeneous phantom, a commonly used tumor/lesion model, was also constructed using gelatin/agar solutions. A coarse-to-fine displacement algorithm was applied, using aligning and stretching to enhance re-correlation. Vertical and horizontal strains were reconstructed from the axial and lateral displacements. Results revealed that the error on displacement estimates was lower when using 2 -D data windows rather than 1 -D windows. For regions at large depths and large insonification angles, the allowed lateral window size was limited. Still, 1 -D windows resulted in larger errors. The re-correlation techniques resulted in a significant increase in the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio (SNRe) and elastographic contrast-to-noise ratio (CNRe) of the vertical and horizontal strain components. An increase of the SNRe of 5 - 20 dB was observed over a range of strains (0. 5 to 5. 0 %). In the inhomogeneous phantom, a vertical SNRe of 27. 7 dB and a horizontal SNRe of 16. 7 dB were measured in the background. The vertical and horizontal CNRe were 35 dB and 23. 1 dB, respectively. For the experimental data, lower SNRe (vertical: 19. 1 dB; horizontal: 11. 4 dB) and CNRe (vertical: 33. 3 dB; horizontal: 12. 5 dB) were found.
