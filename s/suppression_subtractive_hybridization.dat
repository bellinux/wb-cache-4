Genes which saw particularly strong upregulation included genes for cell rescue and defense, cell metabolism and transcriptional regulation. These included Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase activase, which regulates the photosynthetic enzyme RuBisCO, GAPDH, which is involved in glycolysis and oxidative stress response, as well as cell division control protein CDC91 and the NBS-LLR disease resistance gene.

40|$|A major {{control point}} for {{skeletal}} myogenesis {{revolves around the}} muscle basic helix-loop-helix gene family that includes MyoD, Myf- 5, myogenin, and MRF 4. Myogenin and MRF 4 {{are thought to be}} essential to terminal differentiation events, whereas MyoD and Myf- 5 are critical to establishing the myogenic cell lineage and producing committed, undifferentiated myogenic stem cells (myoblasts). Although mouse genetic studies have revealed the importance of MyoD and Myf- 5 for myoblast development, the genetic targets of MyoD and Myf- 5 activity in undifferentiated myoblasts remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the function of MyoD as a transcriptional activator in undifferentiated myoblasts. By using conditional expression of MyoD, in conjunction with <b>suppression</b> <b>subtractive</b> <b>hybridizations,</b> we show that the Id 3 and NP 1 (neuronal pentraxin 1) genes become transcriptionally active following MyoD induction in undifferentiated myoblasts. Activation of Id 3 and NP 1 represents a stable, heritable event that does not rely on continued MyoD activity and is not subject to negative regulation by an activated H-Ras G 12 V protein. These results are the first to demonstrate that MyoD functions as a transcriptional activator in myogenic stem cells and that this key myogenic regulatory factor exhibits different gene target specificities, depending upon the cellular environment...|$|R
40|$|Background An organ such as {{the bladder}} {{consists}} of complex, interacting set of tissues and cells. Inflammation has been implicated in every major disease of the bladder, including cancer, interstitial cystitis, and infection. However, scanty is the information about individual detrusor and urothelium transcriptomes in response to inflammation. Here, we used <b>suppression</b> <b>subtractive</b> <b>hybridizations</b> (SSH) to determine bladder tissue- and disease-specific genes and transcriptional regulatory elements (TRE) s. Unique TREs and genes were assembled into putative networks. Results It {{was found that the}} control bladder mucosa presented regulatory elements driving genes such as myosin light chain phosphatase and calponin 1 that influence the smooth muscle phenotype. In the control detrusor network the Pax- 3 TRE was significantly over-represented. During development, the Pax- 3 transcription factor (TF) maintains progenitor cells in an undifferentiated state whereas, during inflammation, Pax- 3 was suppressed and genes involved in neuronal development (synapsin I) were up-regulated. Therefore, during inflammation, an increased maturation of neural progenitor cells in the muscle may underlie detrusor instability. NF-κB was specifically over-represented in the inflamed mucosa regulatory network. When the inflamed detrusor was compared to control, two major pathways were found, one encoding synapsin I, a neuron-specific phosphoprotein, and the other an important apoptotic protein, siva. In response to LPS-induced inflammation, the liver X receptor was over-represented in both mucosa and detrusor regulatory networks confirming a role for this nuclear receptor in LPS-induced gene expression. Conclusion A new approach for understanding bladder muscle-urothelium interaction was developed by assembling SSH, real time PCR, and TRE analysis results into regulatory networks. Interestingly, some of the TREs and their downstream transcripts originally involved in organogenesis and oncogenesis were also activated during inflammation. The latter represents an additional link between inflammation and cancer. The regulatory networks represent key targets for development of novel drugs targeting bladder diseases...|$|R

The differential expression of 23 subtracted cDNAs was further confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) with additional biopsies. Eight papilloma-carcinoma pairs examined showed a constant upregulation of the transcripts for the multifunctional adaptor protein 14 - 3 - 3 ζ and the Y-box binding transcription factor YB- 1, whereas transcripts for m-type calpain 2 and NB thymosin β, which are involved in cell motility and tissue invasion, as well as casein kinase 1 α, chaperonin, and annexin I, {{were found to be}} upregulated in the majority of the cases. RNA-RNA in situ hybridization and laser capture microdissection in combination with quantitative RT-PCR analysis verified the deregulated expression of the transcripts in the tumor cells. In contrast, CRPV E 7 transcript levels remained rather constant indicating no requirement for a further upregulation of E 7 expression following tumor induction.

To find the genes involved in chemoresistance and the development of gastric cancer, we used the <b>suppression</b> <b>subtractive</b> <b>hybridization</b> method to identify the genes that are overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues compared to normal gastric tissues. Results: In the <b>suppression</b> <b>subtractive</b> <b>hybridization</b> library we constructed, the most highly overexpressed genes were humanin isoforms. Humanin is a recently identified endogenous peptide that has anti-apoptotic activity and has been selected for further study due to its potential role in the chemoresistance of gastric cancer. Upregulation of humanin isoforms was also observed in clinical samples by using quantitative real-time PCR. Among the studied isoforms, humanin isoform 3, with an expression level of 4. 166 Â± 1. 44 fold, was the most overexpressed isoform in GC. Conclusions: The overexpression of humanin in gastric cancer suggests a role for chemoresistance and provides new insight into the biology of gastric cancer.

The current molecular breeding efforts have identified genetic basis of PD resistance in grapes. However, the transcriptome level characterization of the host response to this pathogen is lacking. Results Twelve tissue specific <b>subtractive</b> <b>suppression</b> <b>hybridization</b> (SSH) cDNA libraries derived from a time course sampling scheme were constructed from stems, leaves and shoots of PD resistant and susceptible sibling genotypes (V. rupestris × V. arizonica) in response to Xf infection. A total of 5, 794 sequences were obtained from these cDNA libraries from which 993 contigs and 949 singletons were derived. Using Gene Ontology (GO) hierarchy, the non-redundant sequences were classified into the three principal categories: molecular function (30 %), cellular components (9 %) and biological processes (7 %). Comparative analysis found variations in EST expression pattern between infected and non-infected PD resistant and PD susceptible grape genotypes.

Using this approach, we found a significant up-regulation of several key components of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade. These findings were confirmed by Western blot analysis, which demonstrated that the levels of active ERK 1 and 2 correlated {{with the onset of}} streptozocin-induced hyperalgesia. Intrathecal administration of the selective MAPK/ERK-kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD 198306 dose-dependently (1 – 30 μg) blocked static allodynia in both the streptozocin and the chronic constriction injury (CCI) models of neuropathic pain. The antihyperalgesic effects of PD 198306, in both the streptozocin and CCI models of neuropathic pain, correlated with a reduction in the elevated levels of active ERK 1 and 2 in lumbar spinal cord. Intraplantar administration of PD 198306 had no effect in either model of hyperalgesia, indicating that changes in the activation of ERKs and the effect of MEK inhibition are localized to the central nervous system.

This was confirmed by Northern blotting and Western blot analysis of the conditioned media in different clones of endothelial cells overexpressing FGF 2 and in endothelial cells treated with the recombinant growth factor. In vivo, FGF 2 caused OPN expression in newly formed endothelium of the chick embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) and of murine s. c. Matrigel plug implants. Recombinant OPN (rOPN), the fusion protein GST-OPN, and the deletion mutant GST-DeltaRGD-OPN were angiogenic in the CAM assay. Angiogenesis was also triggered by OPN-transfected MAE cells grafted onto the CAM. OPN-driven neovascularization was independent from endothelial alpha(v) beta(3) integrin engagement and was always paralleled by the appearance of a massive mononuclear cell infiltrate. Accordingly, rOPN, GST-OPN, GST-DeltaRGD-OPN, and the conditioned medium of OPN-overexpressing MAE cells were chemotactic for isolated human monocytes. Also, rOPN triggered a proangiogenic phenotype in human monocytes by inducing the expression of the angiogenic cytokines TNF-alpha and IL- 8.

The total extraction method can be completed within 8 h, resulting in enriched mRNA ranging from 200 bp to 4 kb in size...|$|R
