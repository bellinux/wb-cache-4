The {{multitude}} of rivers and lakes in the entire region is caused by the watersheds of the area being <b>so</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> in a state of sorting themselves out with the added effect of post-glacial rebound. Virtually all of Nunavut's rivers drain into the Hudson Bay or the Arctic Ocean.|$|E

No van Hauwaert, no Masselis, no Defraeye, no Mosson, no Mottiat, no Van Den Berghe, all forbidden to take part by their French bike companies.|$|E
500|$|Bridges {{believed}} that the final lines redeemed an otherwise bad poem. Arthur Quiller-Couch responded with a contrary view and claimed that the lines were [...] "a vague observation – to anyone whom life has taught to face facts and define his terms, actually an uneducated conclusion, albeit most pardonable in one <b>so</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> ardent." [...] The debate expanded when I.A.

500|$|Handel's biographer Jonathan Keates writes that: [...] "From [...] Handel {{learned not}} only {{a great deal about}} the line and shape of an aria, about strong, adventurous bass lines and solid choral writing, but also about those delicacies of {{instrumental}} colouring which he later perfected in his own style". Handel's musical development also benefited from an early and lasting friendship with Georg Philipp Telemann, whom he met in 1700. In February 1702 Handel enrolled at the University of Halle, perhaps intending to study law. In March he took up the post of organist at Halle's Calvinist cathedral (Domkirche), a prestigious appointment for one <b>so</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> indicative of his burgeoning musical reputation in the city.|$|E
500|$|Baywatch and Knight Rider star David Hasselhoff {{accepted}} the role when his daughters, Taylor-Ann and Hayley, urged him: [...] "I got {{an offer to}} do a cameo in the SpongeBob Movie and I turned to my girls, who were like 16 and 14, and I said, 'Who's SpongeBob?' and they said, 'Oh my God, Dad, it's the number one cartoon in the world, you gotta do it.'" [...] Hasselhoff enjoyed his cameo: [...] "It was great fun {{and to this day}} around the world kids stop me and say, 'Are you David Hasselhoff?' because I was the only human in the picture." [...] Hasselhoff said that the film gained him new fans: [...] "It's amazing - so many of the kids were <b>so</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> didn't see Baywatch and Knight Rider so I got a whole new legion of fans." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the release}} of Tool's {{follow-up}} single [...] "Prison Sex", the band again became the target of censorship. The song's lyrics and video dealt with child abuse, which sparked controversial reactions; Keenan's lyrics begin with: [...] "It {{took so long to}} remember just what happened. I was <b>so</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> vestal then, you know it hurt me, but I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive ... I've got my hands bound and my head down and my eyes closed and my throat wide open." [...] The video was created primarily by guitarist Adam Jones, who saw it as his [...] "surrealistic interpretation" [...] of the subject matter. And while some contemporary journalists praised the video and described the lyrics as [...] "metaphoric", the American branch of MuchMusic asked Keenan to represent the band in a hearing. It deemed the music video too graphic and obscene, and MTV stopped airing it after a few showings.|$|E

"I'm with You" [...] The adult ballad hit {{record stores}} in late November 2002, close to Christmas {{holidays}} to remind {{parents about the}} album to, if not to buy it themselves, to purchase it for any children in their family. The song ended up being another hit for Lavigne reaching No. 4 in the Billboard Hot 100, No. 1 in mainstream radio and top 10 in the UK and Canada. It was not officially released in Australia but received radio and television airplay, this song was also nominated for two Grammy Awards the same categories as [...] "Complicated". The release arrangement of the album's singles, with [...] "I'm With You" [...] being served as the third, was regarded as [...] "controversial", given that [...] "I'm With You" [...] was [...] "thought {{by some to be}} the biggest potential smash on the album", and could have established Lavigne as a more mature artist if it was released first. According to Reid, [...] "Some people just really didn't get that. And with the first video, there was some concern that maybe because it's <b>so</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> so playful, it might alienate more serious music lovers." ...|$|E
500|$|Wentz formed {{electronic}} duo Black Cards with vocalist Bebe Rexha in July 2010. The project released {{one single}} before album delays led to Rexha's departure in 2011. Black Cards added Spencer Peterson {{to complete the}} Use Your Disillusion EP in 2012. Wentz also completed writing a novel, Gray, {{that he had been}} working on for six years outside the band, and began hosting the reality tattoo competition show Best Ink. Hurley ventured farther into rock during the hiatus, drumming with multiple bands over the three-year period. He continued to manage his record label, Fuck City, and drummed for bands Burning Empires and Enabler. He also formed heavy metal outfit The Damned Things with Trohman, Scott Ian and Rob Caggiano of Anthrax, and Keith Buckley of Every Time I Die. Despite this, the members all remained cordial to one another; Wentz was Stump's best man at his wedding. The hiatus was, all things considered, beneficial for the group and its members, according to Hurley. [...] "The hiatus helped them all kind of figure themselves out," [...] he explained in 2013. [...] "Especially Joe and Patrick, who were <b>so</b> <b>young.</b> <b>And</b> Pete is a million times better." ...|$|E
500|$|Highway 61 Revisited {{opens with}} [...] "Like a Rolling Stone", {{which has been}} {{described}} as revolutionary in its combination of electric guitar licks, organ chords, and Dylan's voice, [...] "at once <b>so</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> so snarling... and so cynical". Michael Gray characterized [...] "Like a Rolling Stone" [...] as [...] "a chaotic amalgam of blues, impressionism, allegory, and an intense directness: 'How does it feel?'" [...] Polizzotti writes that the composition is notable for eschewing traditional themes of popular music, such as romance, and instead expresses resentment and a yearning for revenge. It has been suggested that Miss Lonely, the song's central character, is based on Edie Sedgwick, a socialite and actress in the Factory scene of pop artist Andy Warhol. Critic Mike Marqusee has written that this composition is [...] "surely a Dylan cameo", and that its full poignancy becomes apparent upon the realization that [...] "it is sung, at least in part, to the singer himself: he's the one 'with no direction home'." [...] "Like A Rolling Stone" [...] reached numbertwo in the Billboard Hot 100 in the summer of 1965, and was a top-10 hit in [...] Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.|$|E

500|$|Angelo {{was forced}} to help Nicole {{give birth to a}} baby boy, George, and she handed him over to Marilyn {{immediately}} as agreed. She then tried to stay away, however it became obvious he needed her when he struggled without her. Marilyn then became obsessed with Nicole having the power to take her new son back. It was then revealed that Nicole would struggle to switch off her mothering instinct after giving George away. Nicole came to visit the baby and Marilyn caught her breastfeeding George, while she was alone with him. Symons called the scenes [...] "volatile." [...] Nicole was unaware that Marilyn has reservations about her spending time with the baby. Of the breastfeeding scene, Symons stated: [...] "Marilyn is shocked and offended, and this cuts to the very core of her worries - that she doesn't have the same natural mothering instincts as George's birth mother. Without a doubt, Marilyn thinks Nicole is overstepping the mark. She feels that a boundary has been overstepped and it could put a big strain on their relationship." [...] After the incident, Nicole is asked by Marylin, {{to stay away from the}} baby. James defended Nicole stating: [...] "I think it's hard to not bond, but this is Marilyn's baby, and Nicole is <b>so</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> wants very much to give Marilyn and Sid this gift." ...|$|E

On-screen, neither family approved of Scott and Charlene's plan to move in together, but when Scott learned his father was only 18 when he got married, Scott found the solution to their problem and asked Charlene to marry him. Minogue said Charlene was shocked at first, but she became [...] "very excited" [...] {{about the idea of}} getting married. She continued, [...] "She knows they want to live together and they have had so much trouble getting their parents' approval that I suppose getting married seems the logical thing to do. They will be together anyway, so they may as well finalise it." [...] After getting over her initial shock, Madge gave the couple her blessing to get married. Minogue and Donovan both agreed that they would not get married <b>so</b> <b>young,</b> <b>and</b> Donovan thought that younger couples should live together first. He also believed that Scott was rushing into things. Scott and Charlene were married during [...] "Episode 523", which was first broadcast on 1 July 1987 to two million Australian viewers.

At Mrs. Phillips' insistence he spends the night: [...] "he felt greatly subordinated; he wished that he might have capitulated to a man."(126) When Cope and Amy walk to campus in the morning, she thinks it [...] "a privilege...curtailed much too soon,"(129) while he would rather have walked alone. Foster's reaction to Cope's fainting is [...] "as if a shaping ideal had dissipated.

2500|$|After Michael had {{sketched out}} his {{ideas for the}} shoot at {{a meeting with the}} {{production}} company and his brothers, Stein and producer John Diaz had a feeling he would skip the actual shoot, so they rented a wax dummy of Michael from Madame Tussaud's museum in Nashville. [...] " [...] was put through the wringer," [...] Stein says. [...] "Its head ended up in the salad bowl at lunch one day." [...] The dummy was ultimately used in three separate sequences, including the ending sequence that shows {{the rest of the group}} standing in a shot similar to the album cover. The television show PM Magazine later discovered the dummy had been used through a close analysis of the video.

I convinced him to see a doctor, he accepted. Then Édouard added ‘I will die, it’s so sad to die <b>so</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> so far away from dear parents.’ He asked for a glass of water. I ran to get water and at my return he was already unconscious. The ambulance transported him to the Emergency Hospital where he died a few minutes later.” Édouard Beaupré died on July 3, 1904 from a pulmonary hemorrhage at age 23.

In the meantime Maria died a virgin, and Serena, who, as may readily be supposed, was desirous to become the grandmother of a young emperor or empress, through fear of her influence being diminished, used all her endeavours to marry her other daughter to Honorius." [...] The account may have attempted to explain why Maria died without giving birth. However this might also be explained by the young ages of the imperial couple, the tale of Honorius being drugged by his mother-in-law Serena considered fanciful. Her sister Thermantia went on to marry Honorius.|$|E

[...] Erik Davis wrote that by 1990, [...] "the Beach Boys are either dead, deranged, or dinosaurs; their records are Eurocentric, square, unsampled; they've made too much money to merit hip revisionism." [...] From the same period, Jim Miller wrote, [...] "They have become a figment of their own past, prisoners of their unflagging popularity—incongruous emblems of a sunny myth of eternal youth belied by much of their own best music. … The group is still largely identified with its hits from the early Sixties." [...] Responding in 1982 to critics who disparaged the group for [...] "not going beyond 'Good Vibrations'", Bruce Johnston said: [...] "I think they love the band {{so much that they}} get crazy because we don't top ourselves. ... every time there's a new Beach Boy record it competes with so many old Beach Boy records on the radio. ... the audience is <b>so</b> <b>young</b> <b>and</b> they're reacting more to the Beach Boys sound-alike commercials on TV and the three or four really big, quadruple platinum repackage albums.
