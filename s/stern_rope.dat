Ashore at Tofua, there were encounters with natives who were initially friendly but grew more menacing as time passed. On 2 May, four days after landing, Bligh realised that an attack was imminent. He directed his men back to the sea, shortly before the Tofuans seized the launch's <b>stern</b> <b>rope</b> and attempted to drag it ashore. Bligh coolly shepherded {{the last of his}} shore party and their supplies into the boat. In an attempt to free the rope from its captors, the quartermaster John Norton leapt into the water; he was immediately set upon and stoned to death.|$|E

60|$|It was {{a splendid}} sunny {{afternoon}} when the kites were finally flown {{and attached to}} the three boats which were commanded respectively by the Captain Leo, and Alf. These three sat at the bow of each boat manipulating the regulators, and keeping the kites fluttering, while the goods and provisions were put on board. Then the Eskimo women and crews stepped in, and the <b>stern</b> <b>ropes</b> were cast loose.|$|R
6000|$|Solve {{pressed the}} hand of his friend in silence, and then went forward to assist {{actively}} in the preparations already referred to. The men heaped up the funeral pile round the mast, fastened the <b>stern</b> <b>ropes</b> to the shore, plied the dead upon the deck, and, when all was ready, hoisted sail. The squall had increased so that the mast bent, and the ship strained at her <b>stern</b> <b>ropes</b> like an impatient charger. Then the men went on shore, and Solve, turning to Guttorm, bent over him, and spoke a few words in a low, earnest tone, but the old man's strength was almost gone. He could only utter the single word [...] "Farewell", and wave his hand as if he wished to be left alone. Solve rose at once, and, applying a light to the pile, leaped ashore. Next moment the cables were cut; the brushwood crackled with a fierce noise as the fire leaped up and the [...] "ocean steed" [...] bounded away over the dark blue sea. Guttorm was still seated by the helm, his face pale as death, but with a placid smile on his mouth, and a strange, almost unearthly, fire in his eyes.|$|R
50|$|On {{the evening}} of 30 December 1978, the freezer trawler Ben Asdale was off-loading fish into the hold of the Russian factory ship Antarktika (Антарктика), which was {{anchored}} in Falmouth Bay. A force eight gale was blowing and heavy snow was falling. When the Ben Asdale had finished discharging her cargo of mackerel, she cast off her <b>stern</b> <b>rope</b> in preparation {{to move away from}} the anchored Antarktika. The rope fouled her rudder and she would not respond to her helm. The skipper, Barney Coe, tried to get the Russians to re-secure the stern of his vessel but by now the fierce gale was dragging both boats. The Russians sent over two officers to assist in getting the steering working and shortly after the bow rope parted and the Ben Asdale was adrift.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now, Glumm," [...] said Erling, {{when all}} were on board, [...] "we must say {{farewell}} to Norway. Keep close in my wake. If they give chase {{we will do}} our best to escape, but if that may not be, we will fight and fall together." [...] The friends shook hands; then, each getting into his ship, the <b>stern</b> <b>ropes</b> were cast off, the oars were dipped, and they shot out upon the blue fiord, which the sinking sun had left in a solemn subdued light, although his beams still glowed brightly on the snow-clad mountain peaks.|$|R
50|$|The 3-man crew of a British LCP(L) {{were led}} by a Leading Seaman or Royal Marine Corporal coxswain who steered the boat and {{operated}} engine controls {{on the port side}} of the cockpit. Beside him was the Lewis gunner who also acted as bowman handling any rope-work forward. The third man was a mechanic who might also handle <b>stern</b> <b>ropes.</b> At other times LCP(L)s might be led or towed by coastal forces craft when a raid was within reasonable range of a sally port. A number of these raids were made in 1940 to 1942 by British forces, sometimes using LCP(L)s though more often going ashore by canoe. The first major landing from LCP(L)s in Europe took place in August 1942 when the Canadians with elements of the British army and Royal Marines landed at Dieppe. The fortunes of the LCP(L) flotillas showed here how units and even individual craft could have very different luck in a landing.|$|R
50|$|Young was {{inspecting}} the new goldfields at Bermagui in 1880. In order to investigate possible sites further north, Young {{and his assistant}} travelled on a small boat with the boat's owner, Thomas Towers of Batemans Bay, and two of Towers' friends. All five disappeared on 10 October. In the morning the boat was observed, but stationary and with apparently only one man on board. Later in the day the vessel was seen stranded on the rocks with no-one on board. The boat was found to contain five bags full of clothing, Young's books and papers, a bullet in its starboard side and some vomit. The men were not found despite subsequent searches, rewards, government inquiries and wide media coverage. The remnants of a fire, some food and three shirt studs were the only traces. The mystery was never solved. Unusual aspects of the wreck were that the planks of the boat were stove-out rather than stove-in, the boat contained several large rocks and the anchor and <b>stern</b> <b>ropes</b> were missing.|$|R
60|$|This {{brought them}} to the {{starboard}} side, where they saw a hideous scene. Hundreds of people seemed to be fighting for room, with the result that some of the boats were overturned, precipitating their occupants into the water. Others hung by the prow or the <b>stern,</b> the <b>ropes</b> having jammed in the davits in the frantic haste and confusion, while from them human beings dropped one by one. Round others not yet launched a hellish struggle was in progress, the struggle of men, women, and children battling for their lives, in which the strong, mad with terror, showed no mercy to the weak.|$|R
60|$|He crossed some misty meadows by {{moonlight}} and {{the mist}} lay {{low on the}} grass, so low that it scarcely reached above his waist, and houses and clumps of trees stood out like islands in a milky sea, so sharply denned was the upper surface of the mistbank. He came nearer and nearer to a strange thing that floated like a boat upon this magic lake, and behold! something moved at the <b>stern</b> and a <b>rope</b> was whisked at the prow, and it had changed into a pensive cow, drowsy-eyed, regarding him....|$|R
50|$|Her problem-plagued voyage {{continued}} on 13 February when her rudder was damaged during heavy storms, {{resulting in a}} total loss of steering control with the rudder smashing into the hull at random. Three crewmen went over the <b>stern</b> on <b>ropes</b> and boatswain's chairs and secured it. The next morning, they rigged a temporary steering system. Badger set a course for the nearest port, and she arrived in Lisbon on 18 February. Slow dock services delayed her departure until 11 April and her voyage home did not end until 24 May. Carpenter's Mate Henry Williams, Captain of the Top Joseph Matthews, and Captain of the Top James Horton received the Medal of Honor for their actions in repairing the damaged rudder at sea. Constitution returned to her previous duties of training apprentice boys, and Ship's Corporal James Thayer received a Medal of Honor for saving a fellow crew member from drowning on 16 November.|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of model}} of a galleon sailing ship, ca. 1900. At center, a small replica of a galleon ship is seen sitting upon a {{rectangular}} wooden stand. The wooden frame and deck {{is supported by a}} large lightly-colored hull. A small rudder is visible near the stern of the ship. Two large masts are visible {{near the center of the}} ship, one small mast is seen extending at an angle from the bow, and two smaller masts are visible near the <b>stern.</b> Various <b>ropes,</b> pulleys, and ladders are seen connecting parts of each mast to the deck below. Imperial flags decorate the tops of each of the four masts on the ship. An elaborate shield emblem decorates one of the sails on the frontal mast, while ornate crosses decorate the sails of the center mast. Small shield emblems are also visible near the striped lining surrounding the deck. Each tall mast supports three large sails. The two masts near the stern of the ship each hold a small triangular sail, and a small sail connects to the angled mast...|$|R
