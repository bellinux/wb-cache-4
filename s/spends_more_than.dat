Journalist Todd Hixon reported on a study that U.S. spending on physicians per person is about five times higher than peer countries, $1,600 versus $310, as much as 37% of the gap with other countries. This was driven by a greater use of specialist doctors, who charge 3-6 times more in the U.S. than in peer countries.|$|E

25|$|Under an MMT {{framework}} where {{government spending}} injects new reserves into the commercial banking system, and taxes withdraw {{it from the}} banking system, government activity would have an instant effect on interbank lending. If on a particular day, the government <b>spends</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> it taxes, reserves {{have been added to}} the banking system (see vertical transactions). This will typically lead to a system-wide surplus of reserves, with competition between banks seeking to lend their excess reserves forcing the short-term interest rate down to the support rate (or alternately, to zero if a support rate is not in place). At this point banks will simply keep their reserve surplus with their central bank and earn the support rate.|$|E
25|$|The UAE <b>spends</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> {{any other}} country in the world to {{influence}} U.S. policy and shape domestic debate, and it pays former high-level government officials who worked with it to carry out its agenda within the U.S. The largest expatriate presence in the UAE is Indian. Following British withdrawal from the UAE in 1971 and the establishment of the UAE as a state, the UAE disputed rights to a number of islands in the Persian Gulf against Iran. The UAE went so far as to bring the matter to the United Nations, but the case was dismissed. The dispute has not significantly impacted relations because of the large Iranian community presence and strong economic ties.|$|E
25|$|In {{any given}} time period, the {{government}}’s budget can be either in deficit or in surplus. A deficit occurs when the government <b>spends</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> it taxes; and a surplus occurs when a government taxes more than it spends. MMT states that {{as a matter of}} accounting, it follows that government budget deficits add net financial assets to the private sector. This is because a budget deficit means that a government has deposited more money into private bank accounts than it has removed in taxes. A budget surplus means the opposite: in total, the government has removed more money from private bank accounts via taxes than it has put back in via spending.|$|E

25|$|Concerning affordability, an {{analysis}} of the 2007 household budget survey shows that the wealthiest quintile of Tanzanians <b>spends</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 4000 Tanzanian Shilling (US$3.10) per month for water, corresponding to about 1 percent of their income. Those in the poorest quintile spend only about 1000 Tanzanian Shilling (US$0.77) per month for water, but this represents 4.5 percent of their income. One of the reasons why the poor spend less in absolute terms on water is that they fetch water for free from wells and streams. The data are not differentiated between rural and urban areas, although {{it is likely that the}} urban poor who have no access to free water sources pay much more for water than those in rural areas.|$|E
25|$|All {{species of}} {{capuchin}} {{tend to have}} a rather similar diet in broad terms; they are omnivores, eating fruits and small invertebrates, small vertebrates and birds' eggs, which they forage {{at all levels of the}} forest, frequently descending to the forest floor. In northern Colombia during the dry season when there are few fruits to be found, the white-fronted capuchin <b>spends</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> half its time on the ground, searching for and capturing small prey. It is extremely good at manipulating objects, and spends a great deal of time examining dry leaves from which it collects invertebrates (for example small beetles and ants' eggs) from rolled up leaves. It hunts frogs and drinks the water which accumulates in the spaces between the bracteoles of the common plant Phenakospermum guianense, where the frogs hide. Hunting amphibians seems to be a cultural phenomenon which the members of each group learn. P. guianense is commonly present in large, dense stands in some types of forest.|$|E

25|$|This {{standard}} supports standard memory cycles with {{lengths of}} 1 byte to 4 kilobytes of data, short memory cycles with lengths of 1, 2, or 4 bytes that have much less overhead compared to standard memory cycles, and I/O cycles with lengths of 1, 2, or 4 bytes of data which are low overhead as well. This significantly reduces overhead {{compared to the}} LPC bus, where all cycles except for the 128-byte firmware hub read cycle <b>spends</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one-half {{of all of the}} bus's throughput and time in overhead. The standard memory cycle allows a length of anywhere from 1 byte to 4 kilobytes in order to allow its larger overhead to be amortised over a large transaction. eSPI slaves are allowed to initiate bus master versions of all of the memory cycles. Bus master I/O cycles, which were introduced by the LPC bus specification, and ISA-style DMA including the 32-bit variant introduced by the LPC bus specification, are not present in eSPI. Therefore, bus master memory cycles are the only allowed DMA in this standard.|$|E

These songs use some sort of real-life noise (from factory machines buzzing {{to the sound of}} a flag rapping against a flag pole in the wind) as an underlying rhythm. Unfortunately, Selma slips into one such trance while working at the factory. Soon Jeff and Cvalda begin to realize that Selma can barely see at all. Additionally, Bill reveals to Selma that his materialistic wife Linda <b>spends</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> his salary, there is no money left from his inheritance, and he is behind in payments and the bank is going to take his house. He asks Selma for a loan, but she declines. He regrets telling Selma his secret. To comfort Bill, Selma reveals her secret blindness, hoping that together they can keep each other's secret. Bill then hides in the corner of Selma's home, knowing she can't see him, and watches as she puts some money in her kitchen tin.|$|E
