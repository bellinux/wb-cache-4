5|$|National Treasures {{have been}} {{designated}} {{according to the}} Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties starting from June 9, 1951. This law, which is still in force, has since been supplemented with amendments and additional laws that reorganized the system for protection and preservation and extended its <b>scope</b> <b>to</b> a larger variety of cultural properties. Some of these changes indirectly affected the protection of designated National Treasures.|$|E
5|$|The act was {{originally}} intended to discourage the handling of stolen property but several courts have judged that the National Stolen Property Act is sufficiently broad in <b>scope</b> <b>to</b> apply to goods crossing into the United States from a foreign nation, and is therefore applicable {{in the case of}} stolen cultural property.|$|E

In 1999, Khan helped to create Lodhran Pilot Project (LPP) to collaborate with Lodhran municipal committee. Learning from past experiences, the project extended its <b>scope</b> <b>to</b> the whole town instead of concentrating on low-income settlements only. The municipal partnership was itself a new initiative that ensured wider civic co-operation.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1910s, quantum {{mechanics}} expanded in <b>scope</b> <b>to</b> cover many different systems. After Ernest Rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr {{was able to}} show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the periodic table of the elements.|$|E

5|$|Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{journalist}} Carol Off began {{research to}} write a biography of Louise Arbour. Following input from fellow journalist and author Stevie Cameron, she broadened the book's <b>scope</b> <b>to</b> include profiles of Roméo Dallaire and Lewis MacKenzie. Along with her research assistant Sian Cansfield, they compiled twenty binders of research and conducted over a hundred interviews, including with the three subjects. For the historical background on Rwanda, she consulted the works of Gérard Prunier, Philip Gourevitch, Alison Des Forges, and the Human Rights Watch. For background on the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, she consulted, amongst others, the works of Noel Malcolm, David Rieff, Roy Gutman. Living in Toronto with husband Linden MacIntyre, the 45-year-old author wrote the book {{in the spring and}} summer of 2000.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, the treason and {{defection}} of Dumouriez {{gave the}} Jacobins full <b>scope</b> <b>to</b> {{take control of}} the armies. Before Neerwinden, the army obeyed its commanders. Afterward, the representatives on mission were given extraordinary powers over army commanders. The generals might pay with their lives for defeat, but the real authority lay with the political operatives. Meanwhile, the new War Minister sent his agents to spy on the generals. These men were quick to report any complaint against officers, which could result in disgrace or execution. Elements of this system stayed in force even after Maximilien Robespierre was overthrown and guillotined.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{had been}} uninvolved in the {{upbringing}} {{of all his}} children. This provided producers with <b>scope</b> <b>to</b> introduce estranged family members. In 2006, writers devised a long-running storyline in-which Paul's son Robert (Adam Hunter) plans a revenge campaign against his father. Robert's motives for his vendetta stem from Paul not being around while he grew up. Paul was happy that he had triplet children Elle, Robert and Cameron Robinson (also played by Hunter) back in his life. He tries to make amends with Robert and attempts to bond with him unaware that he is being plotted against. Writers decided to mark the show's 5000th episode with the story and Robert takes Paul hostage down a mineshaft. Dennis filmed the scenes in a filthy studio set surrounded by cameras, lighting and crew. He told Herbison (Inside Soap) that he {{found it difficult to}} pretend he was trapped underground.|$|E

5|$|Temnospondyli {{became a}} {{commonly}} used {{name at the}} turn of the century. Paleontologists included both embolomeres and rhachitomes in the group. Cope's Ganocephala and Labyrinthodonta fell out of use. In 1919, British paleontologist D. M. S. Watson proposed that the evolutionary history of these large amphibians could be seen through changes in their vertebrae. Embolomerous forms in the Carboniferous graded into rhachitomous forms in the Permian, and finally into stereospondyls in the Triassic. More importantly, Watson began using the term Labyrinthodontia to refer to these groups. The name Temnospondyli was rarely used in the decades that followed. Swedish paleontologist Gunnar Säve-Söderbergh removed embolomeres from the group, narrowing its <b>scope</b> <b>to</b> rhachitomes and stereospondyls. His classification of labyrinthodonts was based heavily on characteristics of the skull rather than the vertebrae.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Meteorological Department {{periodically}} issued {{cyclone warning}} bulletins during the storm's lifetime, {{with the first}} being directed to the Chief Secretary of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands on 26October; the first bulletin noted potential impacts and advised fishermen not to venture out to sea. Six warnings were issued for the islands, with the last being issued on 27October once the storm passed {{to the north and}} west. Due to initial uncertainty in the storm's forecast track, the first warnings for the coast of mainland India on 27October concerned northern Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, and West Bengal. Hourly dissemination of cyclone bulletins were carried out by Doordarshan and All India Radio beginning on 28October. These warnings eventually narrowed in <b>scope</b> <b>to</b> the eventually affected areas, with the last warning being issued for Odisha on 31October.|$|E
5|$|The USPHS and {{cooperating}} groups {{created the}} plan for the recruitment of cadet nursing students. It was broad in <b>scope</b> <b>to</b> attract {{the maximum number of}} potential applicants in the shortest time. The primary target was the high school graduate but college girls were also recruited. The selling point of the program was that the cadets would obtain a free education in a proud profession and provide an essential service to their country. Appeals to join the Corps reached more than 7,000,000 newspaper and magazine readers, millions of radio listeners, and movie patrons around the country. Pleas were made in a thousand speeches, through 2,800,000 car-boards and billboards, and in several million leaflets. U.S. corporations donated $13,000,000 worth of advertising space and technical services to the program in one year. Few media sources lacked advertising for the Corps.|$|E

40|$|Sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>scope</b> refers <b>to</b> the {{property}} that {{willingness to pay}} for an environmental amenity is an increasing function of the scope of the amenity. Measurements of the degree of sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>scope</b> are commonly proposed as a test for the reliability of contingent valuation studies. We evaluate the traditional scope test using neoclassical utility functions that are directionally bounded. We provide a formal definition of sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>scope,</b> and show that directionally bounded utility functions can produce arbitrarily small degrees of sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>scope.</b> We conclude that a failure <b>to</b> satisfy existing <b>scope</b> tests should not be used as a prima facie basis for rejecting contingent valuation studies. This does not imply that small degrees of sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>scope</b> should always be viewed as acceptable. Rather, the results of scope tests should be considered more carefully, with attention given to the substitutability of market and non-market goods.

5|$|This was Chopra's first action role, and she {{was excited}} to the part, so {{she wanted to do}} all the stunts by herself. After Chopra decided to perform her own stunts, Akhtar {{revealed}} that he was happy as it gave him the <b>scope</b> <b>to</b> film the fight sequences from different angles. Rampal, in the role of Jasjit, said that he approached his character in a way similar to how Pran had played it in the original but with an emotional graph. Boman Irani, who plays DCP DeSilva, a role performed by Iftekhar in the original film, revealed that he played the role according to what suited the script, but retained some of the dignity from that film.|$|E
5|$|In response, unions {{across the}} United States {{prepared}} {{a general strike}} {{in support of the}} event. On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd. The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square. A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer. In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other. Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed. Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer. The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the Haymarket affair, and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in <b>scope,</b> <b>to</b> organise for the eight-hour day was made. The event also had the secondary purpose of memorialising workers killed {{as a result of the}} Haymarket affair. Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of International Workers' Day on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{was founded}} in 1920 by Helen Keller, Roger Baldwin, Crystal Eastman, Walter Nelles, Morris Ernst, Albert DeSilver, Arthur Garfield Hays, Jane Addams, Felix Frankfurter, and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and its focus was on freedom of speech, {{primarily}} for anti-war protesters. During the 1920s, the ACLU expanded its <b>scope</b> <b>to</b> include protecting the free speech rights of artists and striking workers, {{and working with the}} National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) to decrease racism and discrimination. During the 1930s, the ACLU started to engage in work combating police misconduct and supporting Native American rights. Many of the ACLU's cases involved the defense of Communist party members and Jehovah's Witnesses. In 1940, the ACLU leadership voted to exclude Communists from its leadership positions, a decision rescinded in 1968. During World War II, the ACLU defended Japanese-American citizens, unsuccessfully trying to prevent their forcible relocation to internment camps. During the Cold War, the ACLU headquarters was dominated by anti-Communists, but many local affiliates defended members of the Communist Party.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Scoping</b> {{behavioral}} variations <b>to</b> dynamic extents {{is useful}} to support non-functional concerns that otherwise result in cross-cutting code. Unfortunately, such forms of <b>scoping</b> are difficult <b>to</b> obtain with traditional reflection or aspects. We propose delegation proxies, a dy-namic proxy model that supports behavioral intercession through the interception of various interpretation operations. Delegation proxies per-mit different behavioral variations to be easily composed together. We show how delegation proxies enable behavioral variations that can prop-agate to dynamic extents. We demonstrate our approach with examples of behavioral variations <b>scoped</b> <b>to</b> dynamic extents that help simplify code related to safety, reliability, and monitoring...|$|R
