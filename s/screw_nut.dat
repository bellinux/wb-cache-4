40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{development}} of a methodology for reducing the energy demand and increasing the life time of ball screws by minimizing the friction torque with adaptive lubrication of the ball <b>screw</b> <b>nut</b> is presented. Therefore, a simulation model of the feed axis has been developed and fitted metrologically at an especially designed test stand with an adaptive lubrication system for the ball <b>screw</b> <b>nut.</b> The model allows the calculation of the optimum friction torque of the feed axis and thus determines the need for lubricants in case a deviation to the measured friction torque of the feed axis should arise. The comparison of tests dealing with the life time of ball screws with standard lubrication and new adaptive lubrication aims at proving the increase of the life time. This endeavor will result in characteristic lubrication strategies for a resource-efficient operation of ball screws during constant operating conditions...|$|E

The maximum equivalent stress of the screw thread changes linearly with the axial pressure.

40|$|A new drying-free {{colloidal}} casting {{method was}} developed for shape forming of ceramics with controllable microstructure. A polymerizable solvent such as furfuryl alcohol (FA) was employed to disperse ceramic particles to form a colloidal ceramic suspension with good fluidity. After casting, the solvent was polymerized into a polymer, resulting in solidification of the colloidal suspension. For the purpose of demonstrating this casting method, three types of ceramic powders (NiO/YSZ, Al(2) O(3) and YSZ) were used to fabricate a NiO/YSZ ceramic tube, an Al(2) O(3) ceramic part with a hexagonal <b>screw</b> <b>nut</b> shape, and a YSZ thin film. Our study shows that the microstructure (pore size and porosity) of ceramics can be readily tuned by adjusting the amount of FA, and the drying-free casting method offers better controllability over the shape forming {{of a wide variety}} of ceramic material...|$|E

A similar model of the actuator has been used to control the humanoid robot Valkyrie. We expose the design of this actuator and present its Lagrangian model. The actuator being flexible, we propose a two-layer optimal control solver based on Differential Dynamical Programming. The actuator design, model identification and control is validated on a full actuator mounted in a work bench. The results show that this type of actuation is very suitable for legged robots and is a good candidate to replace strain wave gears...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For the {{net shape}} forming of {{composite}} products with structure of SB/CF-EP (steel backing/carbon fabric reinforced epoxy) lining, the demolding is difficult. Aiming to net shape forming of transmission <b>screw</b> <b>nuts</b> with structure of SB/CF-EP, a new solution was proposed {{in which the}} high-strength casting wax was used as the release agent. A basic demolding experiment was designed and comparative demolding experiments were conducted for three different conditions: wax and grease as release agents and no agent. The influences of different agents and agent thickness on demolding force, product sizes and surface quality were studied. In comparison with grease and no release agent the demolding force for wax was reduced by 91. 6 % and 98. 0 % respectively. The product shrink could be compensated by controlling the wax thickness. By using wax release agent, the fabrication of transmission <b>screw</b> <b>nuts</b> with SB/CF-EP lining was successfully completed...|$|R

40|$|The thermal {{condition}} of machine tools can profoundly affect the dimensional accuracy of manufactured parts. Consequently, reducing its influence {{has become increasingly}} important to modern manufacturing. One of the most convenient and effective ways to reduce thermal error and enhance working accuracy is volumetric error compensation, especially for CNC machine tools. However, currently available compensation methods are highly complicated and difficult to apply in industry. They require a high-precision laser interferometer to measure 21 geometric error components and numerous thermocouples to monitor temperature variations. These requirements make such techniques costly and time consuming. This paper describes {{the development of a}} simplified and economical method of compensating for thermally induced errors. Compensation is implemented on the basis of only three axial positioning errors, which are assumed to be functions of ball <b>screw</b> <b>nut</b> temperature and travel distance. Instead of an expensive laser interferometer and many thermocouples, a simple laser Doppler displacement meter and only three thermocouples are required for the proposed method. Results show good agreement between measured and predicted thermally induced errors...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic motors {{have the}} merits of high ratio of torque to volume, high {{positioning}} precision, intrinsic holding torque, etc., compared to the conventional electromagnetic motors. There have been several potential applications {{for this type of}} motor in aerospace exploration, but bearings and bonding mechanism of the piezoelectric ring in the motors limit the performance of them in the space operation conditions. It is known that the Langevin type transducer has excellent energy efficiency and reliability. Hence using the Langevin type transducer in ultrasonic motors may improve the reliability of piezoelectric motors for space applications. In this study, a novel in-plane mode rotary ultrasonic motor is designed, fabricated, and characterized. The proposed motor operates in in-plane vibration mode which is excited by four Langevin-type bending vibrators separately placed around a ring-shaped stator. Two tapered rotors are assembled to the inner ring of the stator and clamped together by a <b>screw</b> <b>nut.</b> In order to make the motor more stable and convenient to fix, a thin cylindrical support is placed under the stator ring. Due to its no-bearing structure and Langevin transducer excitation, the prototype ultrasonic motor may operate well in aeronautic and astronautic environments...|$|E
