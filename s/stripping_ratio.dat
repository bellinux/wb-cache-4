When the operation reaches a predetermined <b>stripping</b> <b>ratio</b> (tons of overburden/tons of coal), it is not profitable to continue.

At this point, it is possible to produce more coal with the augering method in which spiral drills bore tunnels into a highwall laterally from the bench to extract coal without removing the overburden.|$|E
50|$|All {{other factors}} being equal, mining {{at a higher}} <b>stripping</b> <b>ratio</b> is less {{profitable}} than mining at a lower <b>stripping</b> <b>ratio</b> because more waste must be moved (at a cost per unit volume) for an equivalent volume of revenue generating ore.

In this way, the effective interferences between the measured peaks are removed, leading, through a calibration, to clear estimates of radionuclide inventory. While laboratory measurements of <b>stripping</b> <b>ratios</b> are relatively easy to acquire, with detectors placed above small-scale calibration pads of known radionuclide concentrations, the extrapolation to measurements at altitudes where airborne survey detectors are used bring difficulties such as air-path attenuation and greater uncertainties in knowing ground level inventories. <b>Stripping</b> <b>ratios</b> are altitude dependent, and laboratory measurements using various absorbers to simulate the air-path have been used with some success. Full-scale measurements from an aircraft require a suitable location where radionuclide concentrations vary little over the field of view of the detector (which may be hundreds of metres). Monte Carlo simulations offer the potential of full- scale reproduction of gamma -ray transport and detection mechanisms.

The deposits (Pliocene in age) can be up to 100 m thick, but average 40 m, and possess an average <b>strip</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1.7:1.

50|$|Lignite is of {{outstanding}} importance in Kosovo. It contributes 97% {{of the total}} electricity generation, with just 3% being based on hydropower. At 14,700 Mt, Kosovo possesses the world's fifth-largest proven reserves of lignite. The lignite is distributed across the Kosovo, Dukagjin and Drenica Basins, although mining {{has so far been}} restricted to the Kosovo Basin. The first systematic records of lignite exploitation date from 1922, when small-scale, shallow underground room-and-pillar mining commenced in the Kosovo Basin. Large-scale winning of lignite began with the first production from the Mirash (1958) and Bardh (1969) open-pit mines, using bucketwheel excavators.Cumulative exploitation from the commencement of mining in 1922 up to the end of 2004 has amounted to 265 Mt. Geologically, Kosovo's lignite mines exploit one of the most favorable lignite deposits in Europe. The average <b>stripping</b> <b>ratio</b> is 1.7m3 of waste to one tonne of coal and the total estimated economically exploitable resource represents one of the richest in Europe, which would allow ambitious power generation and expansion schemes in forthcoming decades.|$|E

5000|$|Kosovo {{is mostly}} rich in lignite and lignite {{accounts}} for 97% of electricity generation in Kosovo. Kosovo’s reserves of lignite are aligned as {{fifth in the}} world, at around 14 Billion tons. The lignite in Kosovo is found in three main basins: Kosovo basin, Dukagjin basin and Drenica basin. The Kosovo basin {{has so far been}} the main basin used for mining. Lignite exploitation in Kosovo was first recorded in 1922, in the Kosovo basin, when mining began. Kosovo Basin has a surface area of 274 km2. The Dukagjini basin has a surface area of 49 km2. Other basins encompass a surface area of 5.1 km2.The lignite in Kosovo is low in sulfur content and has a good lime concentration which means it can absorb sulfur during combustion.Overall, the lignite mines in Kosovo have among the most favorable characteristics in Europe. Average <b>stripping</b> <b>ratio</b> of waste to coal is 1.7m3 [...] to 1, and it is of high quality for electricity generation. The net calorific value of lignite in Kosovo varies between 6.28 and 9.21 MJ/kg, with an average of 7.8 MJ/kg. The humidity ranges between 38 and 48%, the ash percentage between 9.84 and 21.32%, and sulfur content between 0.64 and 1.51%.Kosovo has the second largest reserves of exploitable lignite in Europe, only after Germany and Poland. Lignite is the major source of energy in Kosovo and will remain to be so due to its high reserves.|$|E
5000|$|Exploratory {{drilling}} in the Selby area {{had taken place in}} the 1960s, and detailed exploration was carried out in the early 1970s, showing that a northern extension of the 'Barnsley Seam' was present and between 1.9 and 3.25 m thick, resulting in an estimate of 600 million tonnes of coal in the seam, with total estimated coal reserves of 2,000 million tonnes. Open extraction would have required a <b>stripping</b> <b>ratio</b> of around 500:1, so the coal was extracted by underground mining. A geological report [...] "Coal reserves in the Selby Area" [...] was published 1972, and planning permission sought for a mine in 1974, which was given in 1976 after opposition, including concerns about flooding of low-lying land due to subsidence; extraction was limited to the Barnsley seam, though other seams existed.The project was formally inaugurated by the Duchess of Kent in 1976. Initial estimates were for a construction cost of £400 million, with 4,000 people employed, with extraction beginning in the early 1980s and lasting for 40 years, producing 10 million tons per year. The scheme used an unusual arrangement of pits in the coal field - all coal was brought to the surface at the drift mine of Gascoigne Wood, whilst five pits were created to the east (Wistow, North Selby, Riccall, Stillingfleet, and Whitemoor) which transferred their coal via underground tunnels to Gascoigne Wood. As part of the construction processes, the NCB paid for diversion of the East Coast Main Line from Selby (see Selby Diversion) to avoid areas that could be subject to mining subsidence. Above ground equipment such as the winding gear was constructed enclosed by cladding and with limited height, to limit the visual impact on the environment, which was a predominately rural landscape. Shafts for the pits were first sunk in the late 1970s, and in 1983 the Wistow Mine began production.|$|E

Teck’s Sustainability Focus Areas and economic criteria are used to analyse the options. The analysis concludes that the IPCC system presents many advantages if specific criteria are met to ensure HVC maximizes its investment return...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{methodology}} applicable at any {{phase of}} a surface mining project for evaluating its current technical and economic feasibility is presented. It requires the typically available quantitative data on the ore-body, with its three-dimensional block model developed upon accurate interpolations.

If cost evaluations of essential mine operations are available (such as ore mining, waste removal, ore concentration, transportation, indirect project costs and expected concentrate selling prices), the methodology will provide clear indications on the economic feasibility of mining, including the best available options at any moment.

40|$|The highwall {{mining method}} {{originated}} in the USA in the 1940 s. The aim of the method was to recover coal from a surface mine that has reached its economic limit. The coal is accessed {{at the base of}} the highwall from where a series of parallel entries are driven into the coal seam. Since 1991, highwall mining has been commercially used in Australia in approximately 40 pits at 17 coal mines (Christensen, 2004). Highwall mining provides opportunities to extract additional reserves with high productivity compared to underground operations and conventional surface operations. Therefore, some of open cut mines may consider adopting highwall mining as an alternative mining system when uneconomic conditions are expected due to higher <b>stripping</b> <b>ratios.</b> This paper reviews the highwall mining experience and design practices with an emphasis on geotechnical considerations.
