50|$|Although the {{original}} <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>statistics</b> {{was limited to}} data useful for governance, the approach was extended to many fields of a scientific or commercial nature during the 19th century. The mathematical foundations for the subject heavily drew on the new probability theory, pioneered in the 16th century by Gerolamo Cardano, Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal. Christiaan Huygens (1657) gave the earliest known scientific treatment of the subject. Jakob Bernoulli's Ars Conjectandi (posthumous, 1713) and Abraham de Moivre's The Doctrine of Chances (1718) treated the subject as a branch of mathematics. In his book Bernoulli introduced the idea of representing complete certainty as one and probability as a number between zero and one.|$|E

Regular mathematical contributions began appearing in 1883 and in the next half-century three movements can be distinguished, associated with major figures in the history of mathematical statistics–F.

The first two movements were based on the conviction that the use of mathematical methods could transform the way the Society did its traditional work in economic/social statistics while the third movement was associated with an enlargement in the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>statistics.</b> The Society recognised that enlarged scope in 1933 when it formed an Industrial and Agricultural Research Section: to promote these particular applications was to encourage mathematical methods...|$|E

The findings are that: the scope of construction statistics is narrowly defined making the statistical portrait of the sector incomplete; the statistics are also unreliable in terms of quality and unresponsive to economical challenges of inflation, structural adjustment policies and the decline of the public sector's role in the construction industry.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{statistically}} literate society brings {{the need to}} broaden the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>statistics</b> education beyond mere numbers, formulas and calculations. The {{students need to be}} able to comprehend the world around them statistically. The difficulty the students experience during inferential statistics becomes another problem to tackle. Therefore, a new topic called Informal Inferential Reasoning arises; centering around introducing inferential statistics in early education by focusing on informal aspects of it. A set of learning activities is designed through Realistic Mathematics Education (RME) approach to support 7 th grade students in developing this reasoning. This paper describes a specific aspect of this study, which is the use of dot plots. Dot plots is a type of data representation that is rarely used in statistics education in Indonesia. However, existing researches have shown that dot plot is helpful to help students analyzing graph visually. Design research was used as the research approach. Six students of the 7 th grade of Laboratory Junior High School of State University of Surabaya (SMP Lab UNESA) were involved in the teaching experiment. The results show that dot plots do help students to see data as an aggregate by visually exhibiting the characteristics of the data set, thus helping the students when comparing sample to population or vice versa; a process that is an inherent part of informal inferential statistics.

The research question is: Which position has statistics and probability theory {{had in the}} Norwegian school, and how has the statistics environment developed in Norway {{from the middle of}} the 18 th century? First, I will provide a historical overview of how the statistics environment has developed in Norway from around 1850 and until 1960 s- 1970 s. Statistisk sentralbyrå (1876), Den norske aktuarforening (1904), Norsk matematisk forening (1918) and Norsk statistisk forening (1936) will be central. I will also provide an overview of how the education in mathematical statistics culminated in the establishment of a university major (―hovedfag‖) in 1956, as well as how the actuary-education eventually became a university education in the beginning of the 19 th century. A national debate about disability-insurance in Norway at the end of the 18 th century and the beginning of the 19 th century is also described. This is interesting in relation to den representative undersøkelsesmetoden, which was a predecessor of today’s sampling. A Norwegian named Anders Nicolai Kiær was probably the first to use this method, and it was used in the collection of information for the disability-insurance. In connection with this debate, the actuaries became involved, and argued against Kiær’s use of the method, using mathematical calculations, similar with what we today call confidence intervals. The statistics and probability theories’ place in the Norwegian School is the largest part of the thesis. This part is both about the primary school and the secondary school. Curricula will be important sources, mainly the concrete goals in the curriculum which describe the content of statistics and probability teaching at school, and also textbooks and exams. The first real sign of statistics and probability theory is found in a suggestion to a curriculum from 1964. This suggestion was not adopted, and in the new curriculum which came in 1976, these subjects were only represented at a small scale. Only some descriptive statistics was included, along with elective subjects which contained statistics and probability theory of a relatively broad range. There is some descriptive statistics in the curriculum from 1974 and this content has increased in the curriculum in 1986. Probability theory is also represented in a proper way for the first time in that curriculum. In the next curriculum in 1997, the portion of statistics and probability theory within the total content again increases, and probability is also represented in the curriculum in the lower primary school. In Kunnskapsløftet from 2006, there are minor differences from the curriculum of 1997. The concept of chance is introduced in the school, according to the curriculum, normally towards the end of the lower primary school. By reviewing some books for the last grade of the lower primary school, I have found that chance or probability are often introduced by using examples of throwing dice, coin, etc. In the secondary school, statistics and probability theory first appeared in the curriculum in 1994 in a comprehensive way, after pressure from the authorities and the statistical environment. R 94 was revised when the curriculum for the primary school took effect in 1997, with small adjustments within statistics and probability theory. When Kunnskapsløftet came in 2006, the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>statistics</b> and probability theory were smaller. This is probably connected with an attempt to improve the mathematics subject in general.

40|$|Undoubtedly, {{statistics}} {{has become}} one of the most important subjects in the modern world, where its applications are ubiquitous. The importance of statistics is not limited to statisticians, but also impacts upon non-statisticians who have to use statistics within their own disciplines. Several studies have indicated that most of the academic departments around the world have realized the importance of statistics to non-specialist students. Therefore, the number of students enrolled in statistics courses has vastly increased, coming from a variety of disciplines. Consequently, research within the <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> <b>statistics</b> education has been able to develop throughout the last few years. One important issue is how statistics is best taught to, and learned by, non-specialist students. This issue is controlled by several factors that affect the learning and teaching of statistics to non-specialist students, such as the use of technology, the role of the English language (especially for those whose first language is not English), the effectiveness of statistics teachers and their approach towards teaching statistics courses, students’ motivation to learn statistics and the relevance of statistics courses to the main subjects of non-specialist students. Several studies, focused on aspects of learning and teaching statistics, have been conducted in different countries around the world, particularly in Western countries. Conversely, the situation in Arab countries, especially in Saudi Arabia, is different; here, there is very little research in this scope, and what there is does not meet the needs of those countries towards the development of learning and teaching statistics to non-specialist students. This research was instituted in order to develop the field of statistics education. The purpose of this mixed methods study was to generate new insights into this subject by investigating how statistics courses are currently taught to non-specialist students in Saudi universities. Hence, this study will contribute towards filling the knowledge gap that exists in Saudi Arabia. This study used multiple data collection approaches, including questionnaire surveys from 1053 non-specialist students who had completed at least one statistics course in different colleges of the universities in Saudi Arabia. These surveys were followed up with qualitative data collected via semi-structured interviews with 16 teachers of statistics from colleges within all six universities where statistics is taught to non-specialist students in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Region. The data from questionnaires included several types, so different techniques were used in analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to identify the demographic characteristics of the participants. The chi-square test was used to determine associations between variables. Based on the main issues that are raised from literature review, the questions (items scales) were grouped and five key groups of questions were obtained which are: 1) Effectiveness of Teachers; 2) English Language; 3) Relevance of Course; 4) Student Engagement; 5) Using Technology. Exploratory data analysis was used to explore these issues in more detail. Furthermore, with the existence of clustering in the data (students within departments within colleges, within universities), multilevel generalized linear models for dichotomous analysis have been used to clarify the effects of clustering at those levels. Factor analysis was conducted confirming the dimension reduction of variables (items scales). The data from teachers’ interviews were analysed on an individual basis. The responses were assigned to one of the eight themes that emerged from within the data: 1) the lack of students’ motivation to learn statistics; 2) students' participation; 3) students’ assessment; 4) the effective use of technology; 5) the level of previous mathematical and statistical skills of non-specialist students; 6) the English language ability of non-specialist students; 7) the need for extra time for teaching and learning statistics; and 8) the role of administrators. All the data from students and teachers indicated that the situation of learning and teaching statistics to non-specialist students in Saudi universities needs to be improved in order to meet the needs of those students. The findings of this study suggested a weakness in the use of statistical software applications in these courses. This study showed that there is lack of application of technology such as statistical software programs in these courses, which would allow non-specialist students to consolidate their knowledge. The results also indicated that English language is considered one of the main challenges in learning and teaching statistics, particularly in institutions where English is not used as the main language. Moreover, the weakness of mathematical skills of students is considered another major challenge. Additionally, the results indicated that there was a need to tailor statistics courses to the needs of non-specialist students based on their main subjects. The findings indicate that statistics teachers need to choose appropriate methods when teaching statistics courses...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - To {{provide a}} new family <b>of</b> test <b>{{statistics}}</b> to solve the Behrens-Fisher problem and to compare it with the classic test statistics through a different simulation studies. Design/methodology/approach - A general procedure for testing composite hypothesis to k samples of different size problems {{on the basis of}} the Renyi's divergence is used to develop a new parametric family <b>of</b> test <b>statistics</b> that contains as a particular case the classical likelihood ratio test. The <b>scope</b> <b>of</b> the paper is to find out if some member of the new family <b>of</b> test <b>statistics</b> it is preferable to the classical ones. Findings - Some members of the new parametric family <b>of</b> test <b>statistics</b> behave remarkably well in comparison to the classic ones, as the different computational studies reveal. Originality/value - This paper offers a new way to solve the Behrens-Fisher problem that it is preferable in some cases to the known procedures. ...|$|R
