5000|$|In the Church of <b>Sainte</b> <b>Marie</b> de <b>La</b> Tourette Le Corbusier floors the {{majority}} of the church in pale concrete panels set to Modulor dimensions.

5000|$|In France, Le Corbusier {{remained}} {{the most prominent}} architect, though he built few buildings there. His most prominent late work was the convent of <b>Sainte</b> <b>Marie</b> de <b>La</b> Tourette in Evreaux-sur-l'Arbresle. The Convent, built of raw concrete, was austere and without ornament, inspired by the medieval monasteries he had visited on {{his first trip to}} Italy.|$|R
50|$|Much {{like the}} church at <b>Sainte</b> <b>Marie</b> de <b>La</b> Tourette, the roof of Notre Dame du Haut appears to float above the walls. This is possible, because it is {{supported}} by concrete columns, not the walls themselves. The effect produced allows a strip of light to enter the building, thus lighting the space further, and making the church feel more open.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the heroic}} {{soldiers}} who decorate {{many of the}} war memorials in France, the statue that dominates this monument represents a meditating woman, her face practically invisible, who wears the traditional clothing {{of the people of}} the valley. The memorial pays homage to the dead of the wars of the twentieth century from each of the sections of the commune: Le Bourg, <b>Sainte</b> <b>Marie</b> and <b>La</b> Séoube.|$|R
50|$|<b>Sainte</b> <b>Marie</b> de <b>La</b> Tourette is a Dominican Order priory on a {{hillside}} near Lyon, France designed by architects Le Corbusier and Iannis Xenakis and constructed between 1956 and 1960. Le Corbusier's design of the building began in May, 1953 with sketches drawn at L'Arbresle, France outlining the basic shape {{of the building and}} terrain of the site. La Tourette {{is considered one of the}} most important buildings of the late Modernist style.|$|R
50|$|Le Thoronet Abbey, in {{a remote}} valley near Draguignan, in the Var department, was founded in 1160. The cloister is among the oldest cistercian cloisters still existing. Le Corbusier visited the monastery in 1953, and imitated the play {{of light and shadow}} in his priory of <b>Sainte</b> <b>Marie</b> de <b>La</b> Tourette, near Lyon. It also {{influenced}} the modern monastery by John Pawson at Novy Dvur, in the Czech Republic. Thoronet is now a museum, open to visitors.|$|R
40|$|This Thesis {{deals with}} the {{understanding}} of the essence of sacred object and sacred space as related to the way they are composed and perceived as sequences of intersecting architectural motifs. The design project is a sacred community for religious living amidst a secular urban context - a home for a group of eight monks from the Monastery of <b>Sainte</b> <b>Marie</b> de <b>La</b> Tourette, representing the Dominican Order {{in the small town of}} Croix en Touraine in the Loire Valley of France. The Project is approached through a continuous dialogue between the architecture of the Convent of <b>Sainte</b> <b>Marie</b> de <b>La</b> Tourette and this new convent. This process aims at the thorough study, understanding and use of this precedent, not simply as a reference, but as a strategic architectural palette for the development of the new design. The purpose is a) the discovery and study of architectonic contradictions used in the design of this unique sacred community, and b) their use for the creation of the new design. by Evangelos Limpantoudis.

50|$|In 1909 {{there were}} 26 professors. Beyond {{philosophy}} and theology subject included archeology, geology, paleography, Christian art, biology, mathematics, physics, and astronomy. In 1918 Garrigou-Lagrange initiated courses in sacred art, mysticism, and aesthetics. Marie Alain Couturier studied with Garrigou at the Angelicum from 1930 to 1932 {{before going on}} to have an instrumental role in liturgical art ventures such as Henri Matisse's Vence Chapel and Le Corbusier's Chapel of Notre Dame du Haut, and the Dominican priory of <b>Sainte</b> <b>Marie</b> de <b>La</b> Tourette.|$|R
50|$|Le Corbusier was an avowed atheist. but he {{also had}} a strong belief in the ability of {{architecture}} in to create a sacred and spiritual environment. In the postwar years he designed two important religious buildings; the Chapelle of Notre-Dame-du-Haut at Ronchamp (1950-1955); and the Convent of <b>Sainte</b> <b>Marie</b> de <b>La</b> Tourette (1953-1960). Le Corbusier wrote later that he was greatly aided in his religious architecture by a Dominican father, Père Couturier, who had founded a movement and review of modern religious art.|$|R
50|$|The {{strategic}} {{location at}} the mouth of the Saint John River was fortified by Charles de la Tour in 1631. The fort was named Fort <b>Sainte</b> <b>Marie</b> (AKA Fort <b>La</b> Tour) and was located on the east side of the river. To the west of the Saint John River, Fort Saint-Jean was later built (c. 1790).|$|R
50|$|The {{influence}} of Le Corbusier may be discerned {{in the rough}} plastered concrete work, exposed concrete beams {{and the way the}} interior is dramatized by light brought into the building by high windows. Precedents may be seen at both Ronchamp and <b>Sainte</b> <b>Marie</b> de <b>La</b> Tourette. Care is taken to clearly express the junctions of different materials by negative detailing and the projection of beams past their point of support. The use of diagonal symmetry, gridded planning and modular dimensions all relate the building to both high modernism and classical architecture.|$|R
5000|$|The Temple du Marais, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the Temple Sainte-Marie, or historically, as the Church of <b>Sainte</b> <b>Marie</b> de <b>la</b> Visitation, is a Protestant church located in the 4th arrondissement of Paris, {{in the district of}} Le Marais at 17 Rue Saint-Antoine. It was originally built as a Roman Catholic convent by the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary, whose sisters were commonly called the Visitandines. The church was closed in the French Revolution and later given to a Protestant congregation which continues its ministry to the present. The closest métro station is Bastille ...|$|R
25|$|At a {{time when}} monumentality {{was seen as an}} {{appropriate}} attribute for governmental architecture, the architects sought to create a bold statement of modern civic democracy, placed within the historic city of Boston. While the architects looked to precedents by Le Corbusier, especially the monastery of <b>Sainte</b> <b>Marie</b> de <b>La</b> Tourette, with its cantilevered upper floors, exposed concrete structure, and its similar interpretation of public and private spaces, they also drew from the example of Medieval and Renaissance Italian town halls and public spaces, {{as well as from the}} bold granite structures of 19th-century Boston (including Alexander Parris' Quincy Market immediately to the east).|$|R
500|$|In the 1971 design {{competition}} for the PUB Building, the other three finalists proposed high-rise structures to project a corporate image. However, Group 2 Architect's winning design, in the jury's words, allowed [...] "natural form and function to achieve character and dignity" [...] for the building. The 17-storey high PUB building shows the influence of Gerhard M. Kallmann's 1962 Boston City Hall, also a competition winner, which was, in turn, influenced by Le Corbusier's <b>Sainte</b> <b>Marie</b> de <b>La</b> Tourette (1957–1960) by [...] The development of {{the form of the}} PUB Building was mannerist, however, in contrast to the inherent logic evident in La Tourette, and to some degree in the City Hall.|$|R
50|$|Among {{his most}} {{important}} works are Metastaseis (1953-54) for orchestra, which introduced independent parts for every musician of the orchestra; percussion works such as Psappha (1975) and Pléïades (1979); compositions that introduced spatialization by dispersing musicians among the audience, such as Terretektorh (1966); electronic works created using Xenakis's UPIC system; and the massive multimedia performances Xenakis called polytopes. Among the numerous theoretical writings he authored, the book Formalized Music: Thought and Mathematics in Composition (French edition 1963, English translation 1971) is {{regarded as one of}} {{his most important}}. As an architect, Xenakis is primarily known for his early work under Le Corbusier: the <b>Sainte</b> <b>Marie</b> de <b>La</b> Tourette, on which the two architects collaborated, and the Philips Pavilion at Expo 58, which Xenakis designed by himself.|$|R
50|$|The {{second major}} {{religious}} project undertaken by Le Corbusier was the Convent of <b>Sainte</b> <b>Marie</b> de <b>La</b> Tourette in L'Arbresle in the Rhone Department (1953-1960). Once again it was Father Couturier who engaged Le Corbusier in the project. He invited Le Corbusier {{to visit the}} starkly simple and imposing 12th-13th century Le Thoronet Abbey in Provence, and also used his memories of his youthful visit to the Erna Charterhouse in Florence. This project involved not only a chapel, but a library, refectory, rooms for meetings and reflection, and dormitories for the nuns. For the living space he used the same Modulor concept for measuring the ideal living space that he had used in the Unité d'Habitation in Marseille; height under the ceiling of 2.26 m; and width 1.83 m.|$|R
5000|$|Although he was {{an illegal}} {{immigrant}} in Paris, Xenakis {{was able to get}} a job at Le Corbusier's architectural studio. He worked as engineering assistant at first, but quickly rose to performing more important tasks, and eventually to collaborating with Le Corbusier on major projects. These included a kindergarten on the roof of an apartment block in Nantes (Rezé) (Also: Unité d'Habitation of Nantes-Rezé), parts of government buildings in Chandigarh, India, the [...] "undulatory glass surfaces" [...] of <b>Sainte</b> <b>Marie</b> de <b>La</b> Tourette, a Dominican priory in a valley near Lyon, and the Philips Pavilion at Expo 58—the latter project was completed by Xenakis alone, from a basic sketch by Le Corbusier. The experience Xenakis gained {{played a major role in}} his music: important early compositions such as Metastaseis B (1953-54) were based directly on architectural concepts.|$|R
50|$|Born on 17 May 1852 at Saint-Germain-du-Plain in the Saône-et-Loire department, {{the son of}} Claude Alfred Sordet and Marguerite <b>Marie</b> de <b>la</b> <b>Blanche.</b> Sordet was {{commissioned}} into the 57th Infantry Regiment as a second lieutenant in November 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War. In September 1871, he attended the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr and specialised in the cavalry arm. By August 1903, Sordet had been promoted to General de brigade and was given command of the 5th Dragoon Brigade, followed by command of 5th Cavalry Division in September 1907, 4th Cavalry Division in April 1910 and X Army Corps in May 1912. He was appointed a Knight of the Legion of Honour in July 1893, an Officer in July 1904 and a Commander in December 1912.|$|R
5|$|The six storied Baden-Powell House is {{designed}} in the modern architectural style, as pioneered by the Swiss architect Le Corbusier from the late 1920s onwards, and predominating in the 1950s. At Baden-Powell House, Tubbs made the first floor overhang the ground floor, a LeCorbusier architectural design choice to free the building from the ground, such as seen in his Pavillon Suisse at the Cité Internationale Universitaire in Paris. Additionally, LeCorbusier's <b>Sainte</b> <b>Marie</b> de <b>La</b> Tourette priory in Lyon shows two floors of monk's cells with small windows, cantilevered over the more open floors below, another design choice used by Tubbs in the facade of Baden-Powell House. While Tubbs created Baden-Powell House in the modern architectural style of LeCorbusier, he used more architectural restraint in his own design choices. For example, he made the main visible building component brick rather than concrete. This heavier evolution of LeCorbusier's style was popular in England throughout the post-war years until replaced by the Brutalist style in the later 1960s.|$|R
5000|$|Diocesan bishops refused many {{requests}} {{by people}} whom they considered {{not to have}} met this condition. But authorization was in fact granted either by diocesan bishops or directly by the Holy See to many priests, parishes and priestly societies, who could then use the older forms of the Roman Rite either exclusively or only on occasion. The priestly societies included the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter, the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest, and the Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney. These used the [...] "Tridentine" [...] liturgical books exclusively, not only for celebrating Mass {{but also for the}} other sacraments and rituals and for the Divine Office. Individual priests and communities belonging to religious institutes also received the same authorization. There were such cases among the Fraternity of Saint Vincent Ferrer, the Institute of Saint Philip Neri, the Canons Regular of the New Jerusalem, the Canons Regular of Saint John Cantius, the monasteries of Sainte Madeleine du Barroux and <b>Sainte</b> <b>Marie</b> de <b>la</b> Garde. Various diocesan clergy also availed of the document's provision. See Communities using the Tridentine Mass for a list of priestly societies and religious institutes which celebrate the Tridentine Mass.|$|R
2500|$|Von Eckardt's {{views on}} the FBI {{building}} changed radically between his initial assessment in 1964 and the structure's completion in 1975. At its dedication, he called the building Orwellian, [...] "alien {{to the spirit of}} the capital", and an [...] "overly dramatic and utterly miscarried play of forms". He criticized the interior as [...] "a drab factory with harsh light, endless corridors, hard floors and no visual relief". Von Eckardt did not blame the architects for the building's design, but rather the CFA. Paul Goldberger, writing for the New York Times, echoed Von Eckardt's harsh assessment. He felt the design banal and dull, [...] "an arrogant, overbearing concrete form that dares the visitor to come close." [...] He noted that the high, strong massing on E Street was reminiscent of a similar rear massing on Le Courbousier's Priory at <b>Sainte</b> <b>Marie</b> de <b>La</b> Tourette, but lacked the dramatic hill behind it to give the massing a counterpoint. [...] "This building," [...] he concluded, [...] "turns its back on the city and substitutes for responsible architecture a pompous, empty monumentality that is, in the end, not so much a symbol as a symptom—a symptom of something wrong in government and just as wrong in architecture." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{strategic}} {{location at}} the mouth of the Saint John River was fortified by Charles de la Tour in 1631. The fort was named Fort <b>Sainte</b> <b>Marie</b> (AKA Fort <b>La</b> Tour) and was located on the east side of the river. Both La Tour and d'Aulnay had claims of some legitimacy to the governorship of Acadia because the French Imperial officials made their appointments with an incomplete understanding of the geography of the area. LaTour had a fortified settlement {{at the mouth}} of the Saint John River while d'Aulnay's base was at Port Royal some 45 miles across the Bay of Fundy. In adjoining New England, the people supported LaTour's claim since he allowed them to fish and lumber in and along the Bay of Fundy without let or hindrance while d'Aulnay aggressively sought payment for that right. Word came to LaTour that d'Aulnay was concentrating men and materials for an attack on LaTour's fort and fur-trading operation {{at the mouth of}} the Saint John River. La Tour went to Boston to ask John Winthrop, the governor of Massachusetts Bay colony, for help. Winthrop arranged for several merchants to advance loans unofficially to La Tour for his purchase of men and material to defend the Saint John River fort from d'Aulnay's attack.|$|R
