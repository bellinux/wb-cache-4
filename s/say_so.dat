5|$|For voice casting, the {{localization}} {{team was}} sent {{a list of}} people who might fit the roles, along with short reels for each actor. Once the actors had been chosen, Bateman wrote the voice direction, which consisted of short blurbs the voice actors saw next to the line they were supposed to <b>say,</b> <b>so</b> they would know how to perform it. While the North American version of the game allows the user to select either Japanese or English audio tracks, the European version, which was released by Rising Star Games, only features the Japanese audio track.|$|E

5|$|I {{think it}} was really special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't seen before, all together of a very specific moment of my life, an album of my life. They just get {{to see all the}} things that they hadn't seen that were going on behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, when I look at them, they <b>say</b> <b>so</b> much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E

He later admits it was a prank, as a dentist had removed the tooth the previous day. Later, Andy (Chris Pratt) and April (Aubrey Plaza) invite everyone to a dinner party at the home of Andy's band-mate Burly (Andrew Burlinson), where Andy is living. Ben (Adam Scott) tells Leslie (Amy Poehler) that his boss in Indianapolis wants him back on the road, but he has also been offered a job to work under Chris (Rob Lowe) in Pawnee. Although Leslie wants Ben to stay, she is hesitant to <b>say</b> <b>so</b> outright, disappointing him and leaving him conflicted over which job to take.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} the {{fraternity}} boys, {{and one of them}} tells her information that leads to her suspecting a boy named Chip. Keith and Harmony flirt, and Harmony shows a good amount of true romantic interest in Keith. Logan’s family has been donating $10,000 a month to “Aaron’s Kids”, which Veronica learns is not actually a charity. Veronica talks to Chip, who says that he was with another girl, who admits it while saying that she’ll never <b>say</b> <b>so</b> openly. Veronica turns her suspicion on Dick. After doing more digging, Veronica says that the money is going to Logan’s illegitimate brother, Charlie Stone. Parker insults Veronica for supposedly working with the fraternity. Keith catches Harmony’s husband kissing another woman. After talking to one of the other rape victims, Veronica discusses Claire with a slightly offbeat clerk, who says that Claire went in with a guy. Logan meets Charlie (Matt Czuchry), and they connect over surfing. However, Veronica notices some inconsistencies at Charlie’s private school job.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty of Jassy in January 1792 {{ended the}} Russian {{war with the}} Ottomans, and in April of that year the First Coalition wars began, forcing Prussia to move the bulk of its forces west to deal with revolutionary France. Russia, angered by Poland's attempt {{to move out of}} its influence, invaded Poland in May. Around that time, Prussian policy was already set against Poland; rather than {{discussing}} how to aid it, Frederic Wilhelm and his ministers were discussing how to convince Austria and Prussia to a new partition. Lucchesini has already made several declarations that Prussia cannot aid the Commonwealth, and in June that year, Potocki's mission to Berlin received a confirmation of that, motivated {{on the grounds that the}} Constitution of 3 May changed Polish state so much that Prussia does not consider its obligations binding. Prussian Foreign Minister, Friedrich Wilhelm von Schulenburg-Kehnert, has clearly and with rare candor told Potocki that Prussia did not support the constitution, but could not <b>say</b> <b>so</b> initially, as to not allow any Polish-Russian reconciliation, and now will not even help as a mediator, as it is not in Prussian's interest of the state to see Commonwealth strengthened so that it could threaten Prussia in some future.|$|E

25|$|Theorists {{challenging}} the traditional view that Pearl Harbor {{was a surprise}} repeatedly note that Roosevelt wanted (though he did not <b>say</b> <b>so</b> officially) the U.S. {{to intervene in the}} war against Germany. A basic understanding of the political situation of 1941 precludes any possibility the public wanted war. Military historian and novelist Thomas Fleming argues that President Roosevelt, himself, had wished for Germany or Japan to strike the first blow, but did not expect the United States to be hit as severely {{as it was in the}} attack on Pearl Harbor.|$|E

25|$|Cripps's mission failed as Gandhi {{would accept}} {{nothing less than}} independence. Relations between Nehru and Gandhi cooled over the latter's refusal to co-operate with Cripps, but the two later reconciled. On 15 January 1941, Gandhi had stated: Some say Pandit Nehru and I were estranged. It will require much more than {{difference}} of opinion to estrange us. We had differences {{from the time we}} became co-workers and yet I have said for some years and <b>say</b> <b>so</b> now that not Rajaji but Jawaharlal will be my successor.Gandhi called on the British to leave India; Nehru, though reluctant to embarrass the allied war effort, had no alternative but to join Gandhi. Following the Quit India resolution passed by the Congress party in Bombay (now Mumbai) on 8 August 1942, the entire Congress working committee, including Gandhi and Nehru, was arrested and imprisoned. Nehru emerged from this—his ninth and last detention—only on 15 June 1945.|$|E
25|$|Al-Tabari {{reports that}} al-Mahdi {{was just about}} to promote Harun as heir {{apparent}} ahead of Musa when he died, and adds by way of corroboration another report that al-Mahdi set off for Masabadhan in a great hurry. However, it may be doubted that al-Mahdi at the time shared the reporter's subsequent knowledge of his imminent demise there, and none of the other reported circumstances of his death suggest that he was in a hurry to go anywhere. On the contrary, the sources in general make it clear that he had gone to Masabadhan for recreation, and they occasionally <b>say</b> <b>so</b> explicitly. Al-Tabari does say explicitly that envoys were sent to the provinces, where they obtained the oath of allegiance not only to al-Hadi as caliph but also to Harun as heir apparent (wali l-'ahd) (38). This was probably the first occasion on which Harun was so acknowledged. Harun himself, with the advice of al-Rabi', sent out these envoys, and all of this must have been presented to his brother on his return as a fait accompli.|$|E

The Sistine Chapel is precisely – if one may <b>say</b> <b>so</b> – the sanctuary of the theology of the human body.

These actions, seen as provocative in the North, both privately dismayed Johnson and helped turn northern public opinion against the president.
