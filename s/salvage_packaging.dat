5000|$|As a {{cost-cutting}} measure, War Department {{officials in}} early 1947 were {{making plans to}} dispose of the facility, The radar training program would be moved Keesler Field, Mississippi in November. This led to the inactivation of the Radar School on 5 May 1947 when the last class was graduated. However, Mother Nature put a kink in those arrangements. On 18 September a hurricane caused major damage to Boca Raton AAF and the radar school, causing over $3 million ($27 million 2010 dollars) worth of property damage. Keesler officials began airlifting personnel to the base to assist with <b>salvage,</b> <b>packaging,</b> and shipping equipment. However, before the move could be completed, on 12 October a second hurricane slammed into the base, again dumping torrential rains. By the time that storm had moved on, Boca Raton Army Air Field was totally uninhabitable. Whatever could be salvaged was moved to Keesler. The resulting unsanitary conditions causedmedical authorities to condemn the base, and that caused the facilities at Boca to be closed on 15 December.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{designed}} to be greater than, or equal to, the construction and performance specifics of an inner container, the Performance Oriented Packaging Standards (POPS) of the US Department of Transportation requirement was that the Salvage Drum {{be at least a}} 'Z' (Packing Group III) solids container. Convinced that this was not an acceptable test for a Salvage Drum, on January 1, 1998, the 'T' Salvage Drum (1A2T) became the UN recommended <b>salvage</b> <b>packaging</b> for international shipments. The US-DOT, per 49 CFR 173.3, also recognizes the 'T' Salvage Drum for shipments within the US. Unlike the original 49 CFR Salvage Drum requirement, the 'T' Salvage Drum is most commonly an 85 US gallon capacity steel drum that, meets UN Model Regulations test requirement 6.1.5.1.11, which specifies that when filled with water, the drum can qualify for Packing Group II and be dropped 1.2 meters (4 feet) on its most critical orientation, and not leak. In addition, the drum must successfully pass a 30 kPa Leakproofness Test. Both tests are very severe for an open-head steel container. This testing illustrates the extreme capabilities of the 'T' Salvage Drum when used for the safe recovery of hazardous materials in transportation.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of the {{election}} of Pope Benedict XV in 1914, the Holy See owned 25% of the Banco di Roma, and also had large cash deposits at the bank. Following massive public withdrawals from the bank in early 1915, under the spectre of World War I, in March of that year Benedict XV arranged a <b>salvage</b> <b>package</b> to the tune of â‚¤ 9 million - guaranteed by the Vatican's shares in the bank - from Credito Nazionale, a subset of the Catholic Banking Federation. This action further aggravated Italian police informants within the Vatican, who in November 1915 began reporting that Benedict XV planned to transform the bank into an essentially Catholic [...] "confessional" [...] institution, and Pacelli was replaced by Carlo Santucci in 1916 as president of the Banco di Roma.|$|R

It maintains an aircraft maintenance centre, while aircraft parts are sold by Inland Communications, Mountainaire Services, Progressive Air Services, Pro Aero Engines, Spring Aviation and Westcan Aircraft Sales & <b>Salvage.</b> Meanwhile, <b>packages</b> {{can be delivered}} through FedEx at the Kamloops Airport, while custom and security services are provided by Canada Border Services Agency and Garda Security Screening. There is a radio navigation aid provided at the Kamloops Airport which is used by pilots on aircraft coming from other nearby airports to determine their location. The navigation system is owned by Nav Canada, which operate an {{air traffic control system}} at it. The Airside Business Park and Fulton Industrial Park are the airport's development areas.|$|R
50|$|Castle was a self-taught {{artist who}} created drawings, {{assemblage}} and books throughout his lifetime. Castle was born profoundly deaf {{and it is}} not known to what extent he could read, write, or use sign language. Castle's artworks were created almost exclusively with found materials such as papers <b>salvaged</b> from common <b>packaging</b> and mail, in addition to food containers of all types. Castle mixed ink using soot from the woodstove and saliva and applied it with tools of his own making, including sharpened sticks, and other found objects. His drawings sensitively depict interiors, buildings, animals, landscapes and people based on his family's rural Garden Valley homestead as well as the architecture and landscapes of the places he lived and visited.|$|R
