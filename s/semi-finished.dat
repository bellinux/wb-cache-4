5|$|Kodumanal {{was popular}} for the {{gem-cutting}} industry and manufacture of jewels. Sites bearing natural reserves of semi-precious stones such as beryls, sapphire and quartz {{are located in}} the vicinity of Kodumanal. Beads of sapphire, beryl, agate, carnelian, amethyst, lapis lazulli, jasper, garnet, soapstone and quartz were unearthed from here. The samples were in different manufacturing stages – finished, <b>semi-finished,</b> drilled and undrilled, polished and unpolished and in the form of raw material. Chips and stone slabs, one with a few grooved beads, clearly demonstrate that these were manufactured locally at Kodumanal. Excavations at Korkai have yielded a large number of pearl oyesters at different levels, indicating the practice of the trade in this region. Some of the objects excavated from Kodumanal show a lot of artistic features such as paintings on the pottery, engravings on the beads, hexagonal designs on beads, inlay work in a tiger figurine and engraved shell bangles. More than ten designs are noticed in the paintings and bead etchings.|$|E

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that around 65 % {{of the cost of}} a die or mould is related to the machining processes. Moreover, the literature says that 70 % of the time spent in the machining processes of this kind of parts is used in finishing and <b>semi-finishing</b> operations. The high complexity of the machined surfaces makes mandatory the use of ball nose tools, with large overhang, what increases vibration in the process. These problems have to be minimized, since dies and moulds demand a very good surface finish and tight dimensional tolerances. A frequently used strategy to attenuate these problems is to carry out <b>semi-finishing</b> operations with cutters containing circular inserts, because these inserts produce smooth transitions among the passes and a smaller and more uniform stock material for the finishing operation. The main goal of this work is to evaluate the performance of rounded inserts of carbide and cermet in the <b>semi-finishing</b> milling (called toroidal milling) of H 13 steel with hardness of 50 HRc. The influence of radial depth of cut, cutting speed and feed per tooth on tool life will also be considered.

25|$|China {{has adopted}} a variety of {{measures}} to promote its foreign economic relations, maximizing the role of imports, exports, and foreign capital in economic development. Foreign trade organizations were reorganized, and control of imports and exports was relaxed or strengthened depending on the balance of trade {{and the level of}} foreign exchange reserves. Heavy purchases of foreign plants and equipment resulted in import restraint from 1980 to 1983. Because of the expansion of exports in the mid-1980s, a large foreign reserve surplus, and the decentralized management of foreign trade, imports surged. Huge, uncontrolled purchases of consumer goods led to trade deficits in 1984 and 1985, resulting in the introduction of an import and export licensing system, stricter controls on foreign exchange expenditures, and the devaluation of the yuan {{in order to reduce the}} trade deficit and ensure that machinery, equipment, and <b>semi-finished</b> goods, rather than consumer goods, were imported. In 1985 China had foreign exchange reserves of US$11.9 billion.|$|E

25|$|After the {{two large}} freight ships were {{completed}} the workload went down. There were no new orders for new ships or rolling stock. In 1923 the company got two notable projects: {{one of them}} was a minor repair project of a shipwrecked merchant ship. The other one was for completing a <b>semi-finished</b> icebreaker, which had been started at Boecker & Co. shipyard in Tallinn. The Finnish state needed new icebreakers to ensure year-round access to its harbours, and had purchased the hull via John Nurminen company. The icebreaker was named Voima and completed and handed over to the state in 1924. The project was challenging, but the outcome was excellent; it demonstated the company's capability to undertake demanding projects. However, after these projects the company suffered again lack of work. Due to the poor situation, the company had to discontinue the lease contract for the new shipbuilding area and sell the buildings and equipment.|$|E
25|$|The modern, private {{enterprise}} economy of Belgium has capitalised on its central geographic location, highly developed transport network, and diversified industrial and commercial base. The first country to undergo an industrial revolution {{on the continent}} of Europe in the early 19th century, Belgium developed an excellent transportation infrastructure of ports, canals, railways, and highways to integrate its industry with that of its neighbors. Industry is concentrated mainly in the populous Flanders in the north, around Brussels and in the two biggest Walloon cities, Liège and Charleroi, along the sillon industriel. Belgium imports raw materials and <b>semi-finished</b> goods that are further processed and re-exported. Except for its coal, which is no longer economical to exploit, Belgium has few natural resources other than fertile soils. Nonetheless, most traditional industrial sectors are represented in the economy, including steel, textiles, refining, chemicals, food processing, pharmaceuticals, automobiles, electronics, and machinery fabrication. Despite the heavy industrial component, services account for 74.9% of GDP, while agriculture accounts for only 1% of GDP.|$|E

500|$|The most {{important}} {{characteristic of a}} broach is the rise per tooth (RPT), which is how much material is removed by each tooth. The RPT varies for each section of the broach, which are the roughing section (tr), <b>semi-finishing</b> section (ts), and finishing section (tf). The roughing teeth remove most of the material so the number of roughing teeth required dictates how long the broach is. The <b>semi-finishing</b> teeth provide surface finish and the finishing teeth provide the final finishing. The finishing section's RPT (tf) is usually zero so that as the first finishing teeth wear the later ones continue the sizing function. For free-machining steels the RPT ranges from [...] For surface broaching the RPT is usually between [...] and for diameter broaching is usually between [...] The exact value depends on many factors. If the cut is too big it will impart too much stress into the teeth and the workpiece; if the cut is too small the teeth rub instead of cutting. One way to increase the RPT while keeping the stresses down is with chip breakers. They are notches in the teeth designed to break the chip and decrease the overall amount of material being removed by any given tooth (see the drawing above). For broaching to be effective, the workpiece should have [...] more material than the final dimension of the cut.|$|R
