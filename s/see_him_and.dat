5|$|At daybreak on {{the third}} day, the Phocians {{guarding}} the path above Thermopylae {{became aware of the}} outflanking Persian column by the rustling of oak leaves. Herodotus says they jumped up and were greatly amazed. Hydarnes was perhaps just as amazed to see them hastily arming themselves as they were to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> his forces. He feared they were Spartans but was informed by Ephialtes that they were not. The Phocians retreated to a nearby hill to make their stand (assuming the Persians had come to attack them). However, not wishing to be delayed, the Persians merely shot a volley of arrows at them, before bypassing them to continue with their encirclement of the main Greek force.|$|E
5|$|Phips {{arrived back}} in Boston {{in the summer}} of 1688 and was welcomed back as a hero. His wife seemed very happy to see him. He was celebrated in sermons and at the Harvard college {{commencement}} he was compared to Jason fetching the Golden Fleece. Andros and Randolph were not so happy to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> it seems the feeling was mutual. Almost all of New England was unified in their opposition to Andros and Randolph. It is interesting to note here that Phips, despite having been captain of Randolph's gunship in '83-4, {{does not seem to have}} carried an association with Randolph in the minds of the people of Massachusetts Bay.|$|E

Will is eventually released from the prison and taken to the Jerome's home, where Will and Cal's Uncle Tam is delighted to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> informs Will that his adoptive father, Dr. Burrows, was recently there, and had willingly traveled down into the Deeps — a place even deeper in the Earth than The Colony. Will learns that the Styx, the religious rulers of the Colony, are either going to enslave Chester or banish him to the Deeps to fend for himself. Will refuses to abandon his friend, and Uncle Tam formulates a plan for him to rescue Chester and to take him back to the surface.|$|E

25|$|Westlake {{now has a}} full clock schedule: Making {{the skin}} last longer than 99 minutes, visiting Julie, {{studying}} his enemies and even mimicking their voice patterns- in order to assume their identities to cause confusion and sow dissension. This culminates in him impersonating Durant himself, causing confusion among the mobster and his henchmen. When Westlake and Julie have a date at the carnival, an altercation causes Westlake to lose his temper and inadvertently reveals to Julie that there is indeed something wrong with him.

25|$|In her day-to-day life, {{when things}} are too boring or upsetting, Selma slips into daydreams or perhaps a trance-like state where she imagines the {{ordinary}} circumstances and individuals around her have erupted into elaborate musical theater numbers. These songs use some sort of real-life noise (from factory machines buzzing {{to the sound of}} a flag rapping against a flag pole in the wind) as an underlying rhythm. Unfortunately, Selma slips into one such trance while working at the factory. Soon Jeff and Cvalda begin to realize that Selma can barely see at all. Additionally, Bill reveals to Selma that his materialistic wife Linda spends more than his salary, there is no money left from his inheritance, and he is behind in payments and the bank is going to take his house. He asks Selma for a loan, but she declines. He regrets telling Selma his secret. To comfort Bill, Selma reveals her secret blindness, hoping that together they can keep each other's secret. Bill then hides in the corner of Selma's home, knowing she can't <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> watches as she puts some money in her kitchen tin.|$|E
25|$|Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan) helps Rhys {{out of the}} marquee. Rhys {{insists that}} he has just hurt his ribs and since he is a doctor, {{he knows that he}} will be fine. Ajay finds Priya is unconscious; having been crushed by a heavy pot plant that has fallen on her abdomen. Karl has to {{resuscitate}} Priya, while Sonya and Rhys are taken to hospital.

25|$|Scene Two {{takes place}} in the county jailhouse. Angelo is now Prisoner 22177. He suffers in captivity, his hands manacled {{together}} with leather cuffs linked by a thong. Rita comes to <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> they rekindle their affection for each other. Rita tells Angelo what she saw: that it was Luca who murdered Dino (while maintaining her sister Lana's innocence, as she did not witness Lana striking Dino), and that he had been framed. Angelo is furious and flings a chair across the visiting room. As Rita leaves, other prisoners make catcalls at her. The warden, Dexter, leads Angelo away from the visiting room. However, instead of returning Angelo to his cell, he strips off Angelo's shirt. It is obvious that he intends to rape Angelo. The look on Angelo's face suggests {{that this is not the}} first time this has happened. However, on this occasion, Angelo overcomes Dexter and slams his head into a wall, knocking him out cold.

25|$|Fregoli took London by storm. He did quick-fire performances, impersonating Wagner, Rossini, Verdi and Paderewski {{one after}} another. He would exit stage left as a street {{musician}} and appear almost immediately stage right as a woman. Everybody - including the great actors and performers of the day, such as Dan Leno - wanted to <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> his run was extended and extended, {{as was the}} seating in the theatre; not bad for someone who didn't even speak English. The general view of him was that, apart from his obvious abilities as a quick change artist he was - unlike his rivals - a consummate actor and a brilliant writer. He gave private performances for royalty and aristocrats (such as the Rothschilds, for whom he calmly explained all of his tricks). He inspired a host of imitators, male and female. Every theatre in London soon had its protean artist; even Biondi was there, performing at the same time. There were spoofers and parodists: journalists claimed tipsy theatregoers were demanding their money back upon discovering that all the performers they had just witnessed were actually just one man.|$|E
25|$|The English squadrons {{rallied to}} the main fleet. By the end of August the Allies had 90 vessels {{cruising}} the Channel – temporary French control {{had come to an}} end. Torrington had been sent to the Tower of London to await a court martial at Chatham. The substance of the charge was that he had withdrawn and kept back, had not done his utmost to damage the enemy and to assist his own and the Dutch ships. Torrington blamed the defeat on the lack of naval preparations and intelligence – he had not been informed that the Brest fleet had been reinforced with the Toulon squadron. He also contended that the Dutch had engaged too early, before they had reached the head of the French line. To the outrage and astonishment of William and his ministers – and the delight of the English seamen who, rightly or wrongly, regarded him as a political sacrifice to the Dutch – the court acquitted him. Torrington took up his seat in the House of Lords but William refused to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> dismissed him from the service on 12 December (O.S). Torrington was temporarily replaced by a triumvirate of Sir Henry Killigrew, John Ashby and Sir Richard Haddock; these were in turn replaced by Admiral Russell as sole commander of the English fleet.|$|E
25|$|Myshkin {{follows the}} Yepanchins {{back to their}} dacha, where {{eventually}} Aglaya finds him alone on the verandah. To his surprise, she begins {{to talk to him}} very earnestly about duels and how to load a pistol. They are interrupted by General Yepanchin who wants Myshkin to walk with him. Aglaya slips a note into Myshkin's hand as they leave. The General is greatly agitated by the effect Nastassya Filippovna's behavior is having on his family, particularly since her information about Yevgeny Pavlovich's uncle {{has turned out to be}} completely correct. When the General leaves, Myshkin reads Aglaya's note, which is an urgent request to meet her secretly the following morning. His reflections are interrupted by Keller who has come to offer to be his second at the duel that will inevitably follow from the incident that morning, but Myshkin merely laughs heartily and invites Keller to visit him to drink champagne. Keller departs and Rogozhin appears. He informs the Prince that Nastassya Filippovna wants to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> that she has been in correspondence with Aglaya. She is convinced that the Prince is in love with Aglaya and is desperately seeking to bring them together. Myshkin is perturbed by the information, but he remains in an inexplicably happy frame of mind and speaks with forgiveness and brotherly affection to Rogozhin. Remembering it will be his birthday tomorrow, he persuades Rogozhin to join him for some wine.|$|E
