[...] Other collaborations between the two writers were not acknowledged on title pages or in programmes, but were plays by one turned into novels by the other, or vice versa. [...] Bolton's play, Come On, Jeeves centred on one of Wodehouse's [...] best-known characters; Wodehouse later adapted the play as the novel Ring for Jeeves. Wodehouse's novels French Leave, The Small Bachelor and others were adapted from plots by Bolton.|$|E

[...] Joe M. O'Connell, in the Austin American-Statesman, called Johnson [...] "a wizard", stating that the novel cast a [...] "magical spell", and described it as [...] "a rumination on America's ongoing problem of race, and an excellent modern picaresque sprinkled liberally with comic book action.
