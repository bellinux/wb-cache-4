30|$|It {{should be}} noted that the {{proposed}} two algorithms are also suitable for the system with a <b>single-data</b> <b>stream</b> transmitted for each user. Moreover, the proposed two algorithms both are applicable to the noncoordinated system. However, the centralized scheme is suggested to apply for the noncoordinated system, as the decentralized scheme is a suboptimal solution in this situation.|$|E
40|$|Introduction The Real World Computing (RWC) Project aims at {{developing}} "flexible information processing" {{technologies for}} real world applications. Main research areas are optical computing, theoretical basis, novel functions, and massively parallel computing. A series of massively parallel computers are {{planned to be}} developed to serve {{as part of the}} infrastructure of the project. The first in the series, RWC- 1, is now under development [4]. RWC- 1 is based on the "RICA architecture" in which computation and communication is closely coupled. The close coupling enables efficient fine-grain parallel computation, which is desirable in flexible computational tasks. Multiple-instruction, multiple-data stream (MIMD) type parallel computers [...] - RWC- 1 is one such [...] - allow more flexible computation than single-instruction, <b>single-data</b> <b>stream</b> (SIMD) type parallel computers, since constituent processors does not run in a lock-step manner but and asynchronously and freely.
