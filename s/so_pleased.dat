5|$|Ancient authors {{recorded}} that Alexander was <b>so</b> <b>pleased</b> with {{portraits of}} himself created by Lysippos that he forbade other sculptors from crafting his image. Lysippos had often used the contrapposto sculptural scheme to portray Alexander and other characters such as Apoxyomenos, Hermes and Eros.

5|$|David Wallace {{comes to}} the Scranton branch and says that the client was <b>so</b> <b>pleased</b> with the {{discount}} that they {{decided to make the}} company their exclusive provider of office supplies. Grateful, David congratulates Dwight for the idea and after a moment's hesitation, Dwight accepts the credit. Michael is shocked and upset. The rest of the office, still angry at Michael for his near-disastrous idea, play along with Wallace's misunderstanding and congratulate Dwight. When David sets up a conference call with the marketing department so Dwight can explain his Golden Ticket promotion, Michael interrupts and goads Dwight into revealing the idea actually came from Michael. After much bickering between Michael and Dwight, a frustrated David leaves the office, appearing indifferent about the outcome.|$|E
5|$|For the Coalition, the Russians were secure on {{the north}} bank of the Danube, {{awaiting}} reinforcements from Galicia; the bridges between Linz and Vienna had been destroyed, making French access to the Austrian capital more difficult, but not impossible. After six months of fighting in which the Austrians had enjoyed little good news, the Coalition could claim a difficult and timely victory. The French had retreated from the field with a badly mauled division and Kutuzov had secured the right flank. Indeed, Francis was <b>so</b> <b>pleased</b> with the outcome at Dürenstein that he awarded Kutuzov the Military Order of Maria Theresa.|$|E
5|$|Tool {{was founded}} in 1988 by vocalist Maynard James Keenan and guitarist Adam Jones, who then {{recruited}} drummer Danny Carey and bassist Paul D'Amour. They initially released a demo EP in 1991 called 72826.

5|$|Philip's fleet {{had just}} {{escaped from the}} allied {{blockade}} and Philip ordered that a squadron head to Athens. The Macedonian squadron sailed into Piraeus and captured four Athenian ships. As the Macedonian squadron was retreating, the Rhodian and Pergamese fleet, which had followed Philip's ships across the Aegean, appeared from the allied base at Aegina and attacked the Macedonians. The allies defeated the Macedonian fleet and recaptured the Athenian ships, which {{they returned to the}} Athenians. The Athenians were <b>so</b> <b>pleased</b> by the rescue that they replaced the recently abolished pro-Macedonian tribes, the Demetrias and Antigonis tribes, with the Attalid tribe in honour of Attalus as well as destroying monuments that had previously been erected in honour of Macedonian Kings. Attalus and the Rhodians convinced the Athenian assembly to declare war on the Macedonians.|$|E
5|$|Trevor {{eventually}} {{discovers that}} Michael set him and Brad up, and that Brad {{is not in}} jail but buried in Michael's fake grave. This leads to Trevor vowing to kill Michael, but needing him alive for one last heist. When that heist is successful, Trevor is <b>so</b> <b>pleased</b> that he lifts the death vow but still hates Michael. Near {{the end of the}} game, Franklin is given a choice: kill Trevor, kill Michael, or let them live and face their enemies. If the latter is chosen, Trevor kills Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agent Steve Haines, before capturing Weston, and killing him alongside Michael and Franklin. Trevor once again considers Michael his friend, albeit a friend that he hates, which Michael accepts. If the second option is chosen, Trevor ends all contact with Franklin and says to stay away from him after finding out about Michael's death. If the first option is chosen, Franklin meets up with Trevor, before chasing him with Michael to an oil plant. When Trevor crashes into an oil tank, causing himself to be covered in oil, either Franklin or Michael shoot the oil, setting Trevor alight and killing him. If Trevor and Michael are spared, they continue to spend time together with Franklin, during which Trevor eventually admits that he over-reacted after learning the truth about Brad, and refers to himself and Michael as friends.|$|E
