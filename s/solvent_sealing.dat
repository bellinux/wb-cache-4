The paper is placed in a container with a shallow layer of <b>solvent</b> and <b>sealed.</b> As the <b>solvent</b> rises through the paper, it meets the sample mixture, which starts to travel up the paper with the solvent. This paper is made of cellulose, a polar substance, and the compounds within the mixture travel farther if they are non-polar.

30|$|The liquid {{exfoliation}} of layered commercial WS 2 {{was accomplished}} following the modified report method [22]. Briefly, 50  mg commercial WS 2 powder (purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation) {{was added to}} 20  mL of ethanol/water with EtOH volume fractions of 40 % added as dispersion <b>solvent.</b> The <b>sealed</b> flask was sonicated for 10  h, and then the dispersion was centrifuged at 3000  rpm for 20  min to remove aggregations. Finally, the supernatant was collected to obtain few-layer WS 2 nanoslices. To determine the concentrations of 2 D nanosheets in the supernatant, we estimated the mass remaining in the supernatant by measuring the UV-vis absorption spectrum at fixed wavelength of 630  nm. The calculation result by virtue of Lambert–Beer Law indicated that the exfoliated WS 2 dispersion concentration was about 0.265 [*]±[*] 0.02  mg/ml.|$|R
50|$|N-doping is {{much less}} common because the Earth's {{atmosphere}} is oxygen-rich, thus creating an oxidizing environment. An electron-rich, n-doped polymer will react immediately with elemental oxygen to de-dope (i.e., reoxidize to the neutral state) the polymer. Thus, chemical n-doping must be performed {{in an environment of}} inert gas (e.g., argon). Electrochemical n-doping is far more common in research, because it is easier to exclude oxygen from a <b>solvent</b> in a <b>sealed</b> flask. However, it is unlikely that n-doped conductive polymers are available commercially.|$|R

In one contemplated application, such a battery would be incorporated into a tubular hearing-aid device to be installed against an eardrum. This device is based on existing tube structures {{that have already been}} approved by the FDA for use in human ears. As shown in the figure, the battery would comprise a single cell {{at one end of the}} implantable tube. A small volume of Li-based primary battery cathode material would be compacted and inserted in the tube near one end, followed by a thin porous separator, followed by a pressed powder of a Li-containing alloy. Current-collecting wires would be inserted, with suitably positioned insulators to prevent a short circuit. The battery would contain a liquid electrolyte consisting of a Li-based salt in an appropriate <b>solvent.</b> Hermetic <b>seals</b> would be created by plugging both ends with a waterproof polymer followed by deposition of parylene...|$|R
30|$|Evaporation of <b>solvents</b> occurs by <b>sealing</b> the {{reaction}} vessel against the gasket of the cassette at the evaporate position (Figures  4 and 5). The vessel is heated with {{the option of}} stirring, and the gas supplier provides both vacuum (to remove vapor) and inert gas (to assist with vapor removal) through the ports on the cassette. The required time for evaporation is generally determined by measuring the maximum time needed for complete evaporation of the solvent from the desired mixture and multiplying by a safety factor. After the desired evaporation time, the reactor is cooled. The low-level steps of the Evaporate unit operation are summarized in Additional file 1 : Figure S 3.|$|R

40|$|One way {{to produce}} high order in a block {{copolymer}} thin film is by solution casting {{a thin film}} and slowly evaporating the <b>solvent</b> in a <b>sealed</b> vessel. Such a solvent-annealing process is a versatile method to produce a highly ordered thin film of a block copolymer. However, the ordered structure of the film degrades over time when stored under ambient conditions. Remarkably, this aging process occurs in mesoscale thin films of polystyrene-polyisoprene triblock copolymer where the monolayer of vitrified 15 nm diameter polystyrene cylinders sink in a 20 nm thick film at 22 °C. The transformation is studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). We describe the phenomena, characterize the aging process, and propose a semiquantitative model to explain the observations. The residual solvent effects are important but not the primary driving force for the aging process. The study may lead to effective avenue to improve order and make the morphology robust and possibly the solvent-annealing process more effective...|$|R
40|$|Solution dispersions of {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) {{black phosphorus}} (BP), {{often referred to}} as phosphorene, are achieved by solvent exfoliation. These pristine, electronic-grade BP dispersions are produced with anhydrous, organic <b>solvents</b> in a <b>sealed</b> tip ultrasonication system, which circumvents BP degradation that would otherwise occur via solvated oxygen or water. Among conventional solvents, n-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP) is found to provide stable, highly concentrated (~ 0. 4 mg/mL) BP dispersions. Atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy show that the structure and chemistry of solvent-exfoliated BP nanosheets are comparable to mechanically exfoliated BP flakes. Additionally, residual NMP from the liquid-phase processing suppresses the rate of BP oxidation in ambient conditions. Solvent-exfoliated BP nanosheet field-effect transistors (FETs) exhibit ambipolar behavior with current on/off ratios and mobilities up to ~ 10000 and ~ 50 cm^ 2 /(V*s), respectively. Overall, this study shows that stable, highly concentrated, electronic-grade 2 D BP dispersions can be realized by scalable solvent exfoliation, thereby presenting opportunities for large-area, high-performance BP device applications.

40|$|In this study, SnO 2 {{semiconductor}} nanoparticles were synthesized for DSC applications via acid route using tin(ii) chloride as {{a starting}} material and hydrothermal method {{through the use of}} tin(iv) chloride. Powder X-ray diffraction studies confirmed the formation of the rutile phase of SnO 2 with nanoranged particle sizes. A quasi-solid-state electrolyte was employed instead of a conventional liquid electrolyte in order to overcome the practical limitations such as electrolyte leakage, <b>solvent</b> evaporation, and <b>sealing</b> imperfections associated with liquid electrolytes. The gel electrolytes were prepared incorporating lithium iodide (LiI) and tetrapropylammonium iodide (Pr 4 N+I−) salts, separately, into the mixture which contains polyacrylonitrile as a polymer, propylene carbonate and ethylene carbonate as plasticizers, iodide/triiodide as the redox couple, acetonitrile as the solvent, and 4 -tertiary butylpyridine as an electrolyte additive. In order to overcome the recombination problem associated with the SnO 2 due to its higher electron mobility, ultrathin layer of CaCO 3 coating was used to cover the surface recombination sites of SnO 2 nanoparticles. Maximum energy conversion efficiency of 5. 04 % is obtained for the device containing gel electrolyte incorporating LiI as the salt. For the same gel electrolyte, the ionic conductivity and the diffusion coefficient of the triiodide ions are 4. 70 × 10 − 3 [*]S[*]cm− 1 and 4. 31 × 10 − 7 [*]cm 2 [*]s− 1, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Reaction of the spirocyclic 2, 5 -dihydro-l, 3, 4 -thiadiazole 7 and thiobenzophenone S-oxide (6 a) in THF at 45 ° {{yielded the}} spirocyclic 1, 3 -dithiolane 1 -oxide 8, thiirane 9, and the diazane {{derivative}} 10 in {{a ratio of}} 61 : 15 : 23 (Scheme 2). The formation of 8 is rationalized by a 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition of ‘thiocarbonyl-methanide’ 1, generated from 7 by thermal elimination of N 2, and the C=S bond of sulfine 6 a. Cyclization of intermediate 1 leads to thiirane 9. Under the same conditions, 7 and adamantane- 2 -thione S-oxide (6 b) or 2, 2, 4, 4 -tetramethyl- 3 -thioxocyclobutanone S-oxide (4) reacted to give only 9 and 10 but no cycloadduct of type 8 (Scheme 4). With the aim to favor the formation of 8, a mixture of 6 a and 1. 1 equiv. of 7 was heated to 45 ° without any <b>solvent</b> in a <b>sealed</b> tube. The ratio of products was only slightly {{different from that of}} the thermolysis in THF. An analogous experiment with 7 and 9 H-fluorene- 9 -thione S-oxide (6 c) yielded cycloadduct 13 and 9 (Scheme 5). It is most interesting that the 1, 3 -dipolar cycloadditions of 1 and the sulfines 6 a and 6 c proceeded with different regioselectivity. A reaction mechanism for the unexpected formation of 10 is proposed in Scheme 7.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{intercept}} attempts to smuggle nuclear weapons into the United States {{is critically important}} for homeland security. New types of neutron detectors are especially needed, as current devices employ a rare helium isotope (3 He), which was a byproduct of the production of hydrogen bombs. As the production of nuclear weapons has largely ceased {{and the need for}} homeland security has grown, demand for 3 He has greatly exceeded supply. Boron phosphide, BP, a compound semiconductor, is a potential alternative for neutron detectors because of the large thermal neutron capture cross-section of the boron- 10 isotope (3840 barns). In this study, cubic BP crystals were grown by crystallizing dissolved boron and phosphorus from a nickel <b>solvent</b> in a <b>sealed</b> (initially evacuated) quartz tube. The boron - nickel solution was located {{at one end of the}} tube and held at 1150 °C. Phosphorus, initially at the opposite end of the tube at a temperature of 430 °C, vaporized producing a pressure of 1 – 5 atmospheres. Transparent red BP crystals, mostly hexagonal shape and up to 2 mm in the largest dimension were obtained with a cooling rate of 3 °C per hour, and less than 0. 5 mm with a cooling rate of 10 °C per hour. The lattice constant of the crystals was 4. 534 Ǻ, as measured by x-ray diffraction. Intense, sharp Raman phonon peaks were located at 800 cm- 1 and 830 cm- 1, in agreement to values reported in the literature. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) also confirmed the synthesized crystals were cubic BP crystals, with boron to phosphorus atomic ratio of 1 : 1. Therefore, this flux growth method is capable of growing large, high quality BP crystals...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} synthesis of several transition-metal polyphosphides including orthorhombic FePc 2, cubic CoP 3, cubic NiP 2, monoclinic PdP 2 and monoclinic CuP 2. The investigation of these materials was initiated by the discovery of MPx formation upon reacting a metal halide with yellow P 4 in superheated toluene. When these MPx products were annealed at moderate temperatures (350 - 500 °C), crystalline phosphorus-rich phases were afforded. Upon further investigation, we found that these phases have been primarily synthesized from high-temperature elemental reactions and that low temperature routes to these phase-pure polyphosphides using at least one non-elemental source were non-existent in literature. The absence of low-temperature, 2 ̆ 2 bottom up 2 ̆ 2 routes to these materials encouraged us to investigate our initial findings further. Metal-rich counterparts to the aforementioned polyphosphides have been reported on several occasions and have been successfully produced as nanoparticles via molecular, solvothermal reactions. These reports consistently used an excess of phosphorus in their reactions and still afforded metal-rich products, and often times produced materials {{with a combination of}} metal-rich and phosphorus-rich phases. These routes showed the inability to dial in the phosphorus content of the produced MPx phases and did not use balanced stoichiometry to rationalize the chemistry, and rarely identified reaction byproducts. This prompted us to design a synthesis in which discrete amounts of phosphours reagent could be used to target specific phases and in which byproducts could be identified allowing us to propose stoichiometric reactions. In order to determine reaction byproducts, a metal halide and yellow P 4 were reacted in together without <b>solvent</b> in <b>sealed</b> ampoules. The clear liquid byproduct was identified as PCl 3 or PBr 3 and balanced reactions could then be performed In these reactions metal halides and phosphorus (red or yellow) were balanced such that the chloride was ideally removed has PCl 3 and any remaining phosphorus was used to form targeted, phase-pure MPx phases. Using this stoichiometry in solid-state reactions, all of the aforementioned polyphosphide phases were synthesized as phase pure products at moderate temperatures (500 - 700 °C). By pelletizing the metal halide reagents in reactions with yellow P 4 or by co-pelletizing the metal halide with red phosphorus, pellet products reminiscent of the reagent pellet could be afforded. After identifying the PCl 3 byproduct, the stoichiometry used in solid-state reactions was translated to solvothermal reactions. In these reactions, amorphous MPx products were synthesized from metal halides and yellow P 4 in various solvents (superheated toluene, 1 -octadecene and hexadecane), and upon annealing (350 - 500 °C), targeted phase -pure CoP 3, NiP 2 and CuP 2 were produced. Reactions substituting red phosphorus for yellow P 4 in hexadecane reactions also yielded the same crystalline phases. Solvothermal reactions were modified by the addition of Lewis-base surfactants which led to lower reaction temperatures and in certain systems afforded nanoparticles (10 - 30 nm). In these reactions a metal acetylacetonate or halide was complexed with a Lewis base, activating the metal halide or acetylacetonate bond, increasing their solubility and reactivity with yellow P 4. The Lewis-base surfactants also acted to stunt particle growth. These systems afforded phase-pure NiP 2 and CuP 2 nanoparticles for the first time...|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Chemical EngineeringJ. H. EdgarBoron phosphide, BP, is a III-V {{compound}} semiconductor {{with a wide}} band gap of 2. 0 eV that is potentially useful in solid state neutron detectors {{because of the large}} thermal neutron capture cross-section of the boron- 10 isotope (3840 barns). In this study, cubic BP crystals were grown by crystallizing dissolved boron and phosphorus from a nickel <b>solvent</b> in a <b>sealed</b> (previously evacuated) quartz tube. The boron - nickel solution was located {{at one end of the}} tube and held at 1150 °C. Phosphorus, initially at the opposite end of the tube at a temperature of 430 °C, vaporized, filling the tube to a pressure of 1 – 5 atmospheres. The phosphorus then dissolved into solution, producing BP. Transparent red crystals up to 4 mm in the largest dimension with mostly hexagonal shape were obtained with a cooling rate of 3 °C per hour. The crystal size decreased as the cooling rate increased, and also as growth time decreased. The characterization with x-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy established that the BP produced through this method were highly crystalline. The lattice constant of the crystals was 4. 534 Ǻ, as measured by x-ray diffraction. Intense, sharp Raman phonon peaks were located at 800 cm[superscript]- 1 and 830 cm[superscript]- 1, in agreement with the values reported in the literature. The FWHM for XRD and Raman spectra were 0. 275 ° and 4 cm[superscript]- 1 which are the narrowest ever reported and demonstrates the high quality of the produced crystals. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) also confirmed the synthesized crystals were cubic BP crystals, with a boron to phosphorus atomic ratio of 1 : 1. Defect selective etching of BP at 300 ºC for two minutes with molten KOH/NaOH revealed triangular and striated etch pits with low densities of defects of ~ 4 x 10 [superscript] 7 cm[superscript]- 2 and 9. 2 x 10 [superscript] 7 cm[superscript]- 2 respectively. The BP crystals were n-type, and an electron mobility of ~ 39. 8 cm[superscript] 2 /V*s was measured. This is favorable for application in neutron detection.
