5|$|Astronomical data {{taken with}} CCDs must undergo several {{calibration}} steps {{before they are}} suitable for astronomical analysis. STScI has developed sophisticated <b>software</b> <b>that</b> automatically calibrates data when they are requested from the archive using the best calibration files available. This 'on-the-fly' processing means that large data requests can take a day or more to be processed and returned. The process by which data is calibrated automatically is known as 'pipeline reduction', and is increasingly common at major observatories. Astronomers may if they wish retrieve the calibration files themselves and run the pipeline reduction software locally. This may be desirable when calibration files other than those selected automatically need to be used.|$|E

5|$|CGI {{special effects}} {{for the series}} were {{provided}} by The Mill. The production team wanted a talking dragon, but {{they were worried about}} the lip sync and did not think it would be believable until they saw the first test. The Mill created a <b>software</b> <b>that</b> would read Hurt's facial muscles and incorporated it into the animation. Another concern was that the eyes would not convey the character, but this was corrected by the final version. Additional sound effects, such as the clanging chain, were added to give the creature weight. The knife Mary throws at Arthur was also completely CGI, though the shot of it hitting the chair was real.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>software</b> <b>that</b> runs on Linux can run on FreeBSD {{using an}} {{optional}} built-in compatibility layer. Hence, most Linux binaries can be run on FreeBSD, including some proprietary applications distributed only in binary form. This compatibility layer {{is not an}} emulation; Linux's system call interface is implemented in the FreeBSD's kernel and hence, Linux executable images and shared libraries are treated the same as FreeBSD's native executable images and shared libraries. Additionally, FreeBSD provides compatibility layers for several other Unix-like operating systems, in addition to Linux, such as BSD/OS and SVR4, however, it is more common for users to compile those programs directly on FreeBSD.|$|E

It is compatible with almost all online poker websites' software and interfaces. PokerTracker 4 began public beta testing in March 2012. In August 2012, the company commercially launched a Microsoft Windows version of PokerTracker 4. In January 2013 as PokerTracker version 4.05.10 was rolled out, the company began alpha testing an Apple OS X version of the software. PokerTracker 4 was produced from scratch rather than by refining PokerTracker 3 and other earlier versions.|$|E
5|$|Steam's {{primary service}} {{is to allow}} its users to {{download}} games and other <b>software</b> <b>that</b> they have in their virtual software libraries to their local computers as game cache files (GCFs). Initially, Valve was required to be the publisher for these titles since they had sole access to the Steam's database and engine, but {{with the introduction of}} the Steamworks software development kit (SDK) in May 2008, anyone could potentially become a publisher to Steam, outside of Valve's involvement to curate titles on the service.|$|E
5|$|The Tunnel of Light is {{an artistic}} display {{of color and}} sound {{surrounding}} the escalator at the station. 1800 fluorescent lamps and 44 speakers are installed behind a layer of glass along the corridor, steadily changing color and mood. The theme is based on different experiences of travel in time and place. There are light and sound combinations for all seasons and all phases of life. The project was initiated by Kristin Jarmund. The light system was developed by Per Åge Lyså at Intravision System, and the <b>software</b> <b>that</b> mixes sound and color was developed by Yngve Sandboe. The music was composed by Bjarne Kvinnsland, mainly based on recorded samples. Among these are text written and performed by Beate Grimsrud.|$|E

The developers sought to increase replay value by focusing on improving artificial intelligence. Rather than scripting enemy encounters, they focused on a more open world or sandbox approach to battles.|$|E

5|$|A binder {{with the}} film's storyboards {{served as a}} {{reference}} for live-action filming, shots that would be filmed {{in front of a}} chroma key blue screen, and shots that would be composed using CGI. The sets were often built with the parts that would be required on screen; often they were built only up to the heights of the actors. Chroma key was extensively used for digital set extensions, backgrounds or scenes that required cinematographer David Tattersall to seek powerful lamps to light the sets and visual effects supervisor John Knoll to develop <b>software</b> <b>that</b> would remove the blue reflection from shiny floors. Knoll, who remained on set through most of the production, worked closely with Tatterstall to ensure that the shots were suitable to add effects later. The cameras were fitted with data capture models to provide technical data for the CGI artists.|$|E
5|$|BeppoSAX functioned until 2002 and CGRO (with BATSE) was deorbited in 2000. However, the {{revolution}} {{in the study of}} gamma-ray bursts motivated the development of a number of additional instruments designed specifically to explore the nature of GRBs, especially in the earliest moments following the explosion. The first such mission, HETE-2, launched in 2000 and functioned until 2006, providing most of the major discoveries during this period. One of the most successful space missions to date, Swift, was launched in 2004 and as of 2016 is still operational. Swift is equipped with a very sensitive gamma ray detector as well as on-board X-ray and optical telescopes, which can be rapidly and automatically slewed to observe afterglow emission following a burst. More recently, the Fermi mission was launched carrying the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor, which detects bursts at a rate of several hundred per year, some of which are bright enough to be observed at extremely high energies with Fermi's Large Area Telescope. Meanwhile, on the ground, numerous optical telescopes have been built or modified to incorporate robotic control <b>software</b> <b>that</b> responds immediately to signals sent through the Gamma-ray Burst Coordinates Network. This allows the telescopes to rapidly repoint towards a GRB, often within seconds of receiving the signal and while the gamma-ray emission itself is still ongoing.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, Elite Systems, who {{produced}} a successful range of {{software for the}} original ZX Spectrum in the 1980s, announced plans for a Spectrum-themed bluetooth keyboard that would attach to mobile devices such as the iPad. The company provided a crowdfunding campaign in order to fund the project, which would be compatible with games already released on iTunes and Google Play. Elite Systems took down its Spectrum Collection application the following month, due to complaints from authors of the original 1980s game <b>software</b> <b>that</b> {{they had not been}} paid for the content. Later that year, a £100 Sinclair ZX Spectrum Vega retro video game console was announced by Retro Computers and crowdfunded on IndieGogo, with the apparent backing of Clive Sinclair as an investor, but without a full keyboard and manufactured in a limited capacity.|$|E
