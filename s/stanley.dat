5|$|<b>Stanley</b> {{decided in}} 1901 {{to build and}} set up <b>Stanley</b> Technical Trades School, {{the first of its}} kind in the country. The school was {{designed}} to educate boys between the ages of 12 and 15 in general studies, as well as trade. It was made to Stanley’s own design and included an astronomy tower, and opened in 1907. When it was presented to the public in 1907, it had an endowment valued at £50,000. It was later renamed as <b>Stanley</b> Technical School (now Harris Academy South Norwood). The William F. <b>Stanley</b> Trust (originally The <b>Stanley</b> Foundation) was set up as a charitable Trust to assist with the management of the <b>Stanley</b> Technical Trades School. On 23 November 2006, Lady Harris (wife of Philip Harris, Baron Harris of Peckham, founder of the Harris Federation) and David Cameron (at the time, the leader of the Conservative Party and the Leader of the Opposition) placed a time capsule to recognise the contribution of <b>Stanley</b> to South Norwood. The capsule included a letter from Cameron, a copy of the speech given by William <b>Stanley,</b> on the opening of the <b>Stanley</b> Technical Trades School on 26 March 1907, two reference books (William <b>Stanley</b> the Man; William Stanley’s School), as well as artefacts from both <b>Stanley</b> Technical High School for Boys and the Harris Federation of schools.|$|E

5|$|<b>Stanley</b> {{never saw}} a <b>Stanley</b> Cup {{championship}} game, nor did he ever present the Cup. Although his term as Governor General ended in September 1893, {{he was forced to}} return to England on July 15.

40|$|In this essay, I shall briefly present Epistemic Contextualism (EC), Invariantism and Interest- Relative Invariantism (IRI) (section 2). Then I {{will discuss}} three theses of Jason <b>Stanley’s</b> Knowledge and Practical Interests (Oxford 2005). I argue that <b>Stanley’s</b> case against Contextualism {{is based on}} a {{misconception}} of its semantic nature, that there is a disadvantage for Interest-Relative Invariantism in terms of the sceptical paradox and that <b>Stanley’s</b> explanation of intuitions can be interpreted in favour of Contextualism (sections 3. 1. - 3. 3.) ...|$|R
5|$|According to Lennon, the <b>Stanley</b> family {{once owned}} {{the whole of}} Woolton village. William <b>Stanley,</b> 6th Earl of Derby did once own the manorial rights to Woolton but Lennon's <b>Stanley</b> family were from humbler origins and only came to Liverpool in the 1870s. Mimi's {{grandfather}} was born in Birmingham and her great grandfather was born in London. Mimi's father, George Ernest <b>Stanley,</b> {{was born in the}} Everton district of Liverpool in 1874 to William Henry <b>Stanley</b> and Eliza Jane Gildea. George's mother, Eliza Jane Gildea, was born in Omagh, County Tyrone, Ireland. By 1891 the Stanleys were living in Upper Frederick Street, south of the city centre, in the same inner city area of Liverpool as the family of George's future wife, Annie Millward. Mimi's mother, Annie Jane Millward, was born in Chester in 1873, to Welsh parents. George Ernest <b>Stanley</b> and Annie Millward were married at St Peter's Church, Liverpool on 19 November 1906. <b>Stanley</b> was a merchant seaman often away at sea so was absent from some census records.|$|E

5|$|As {{the team}} with the best regular season record, the Presidents' Trophy winner is {{guaranteed}} home-ice advantage in all four rounds of the <b>Stanley</b> Cup playoffs, provided they advance that far. However, it does not guarantee that success; only eight of these winners have gone on to win the <b>Stanley</b> Cup. Three other teams reached the <b>Stanley</b> Cup Finals, but failed to win. The last team to win both the Presidents' Trophy and the <b>Stanley</b> Cup in the same season was the 2012–13 Chicago Blackhawks. The only team to accomplish this more than once is the Detroit Red Wings.|$|E

So they {{asked him if he}} would do some paintings for St Luke's Chapel, which was recently converted from the ground floor of Block 151, near the area where <b>Stanley</b> was recuperating. The Chapel was dedicated to St Luke the Physician. <b>Stanley</b> agreed, and sought inspiration for the proposed paintings in the Gospels.|$|E

5|$|Due to the 'challenge' {{format of}} <b>Stanley</b> Cup play before 1915, {{there is often}} {{confusion}} about how many <b>Stanley</b> Cups the Senators should be given credit for: nine, ten or eleven. The Senators were <b>Stanley</b> Cup champions {{at the end of}} nine hockey seasons without dispute. In another two seasons, 1905–06 and 1909–10, the Senators won <b>Stanley</b> Cup challenges but were not champions {{at the end of the}} season. The Hockey Hall of Fame and the National Hockey League agree that the Senators of 1906 were champions but disagree on whether the Senators were champions in 1910. In both seasons, the Senators were the undisputed defending champions, and during that year's hockey season, the Senators won <b>Stanley</b> Cup challenges. However, by the end of both hockey seasons, they were no longer holders of the <b>Stanley</b> Cup.|$|E

5|$|During the 1927–28 season, Morenz {{became the}} first player in NHL history to score 50points in a single season. Morenz was the first NHL player to score a second <b>Stanley</b> Cup winning goal, with the Canadiens' victory in the 1930 <b>Stanley</b> Cup Finals over the Boston Bruins. The Bruins, who {{finished}} with a 38–5–1 record {{and at one point}} during the season went 23 games without a defeat, lost consecutive games to Montreal in the finals, 3–0 and 4–3.

5|$|During {{the spring}} and into the summer, <b>Stanley</b> began meeting with Senator Byrd, State Senator Gray, and others to strategize about a course of action. Byrd was {{concerned}} that one or more local school districts might integrate, creating a domino effect {{that would lead to}} integration across the entire South. Preventing this from happening became the preeminent concern of <b>Stanley,</b> Byrd, and the others. <b>Stanley</b> called the Gray Commission back into session in late May 1956, but the group was unable to immediately come up with any new recommendations. Attorney General Almond publicly urged <b>Stanley</b> to call a special session of the legislature on May 31, but House Speaker Moore demanded to know what proposals Almond felt the legislature should pass before any special session was called. On June 4, the Gray Commission again reported to the governor that it {{had not been able to}} improve on its November proposals, but it, too, advised the governor to call a special session of the legislature. The following day, Governor <b>Stanley</b> announced he would call the legislature into special session in late August.|$|E
