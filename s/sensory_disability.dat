40|$|Trevarthen’s {{theory of}} innate intersubjectivity is {{relevant}} to understanding communication problems in children with <b>sensory</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Trevarthen and Aitken used the term “intersubjectivity” to describe “the ability of humans to detect and change each other’s minds and behavior”. When children lack auditory and/or visual means of interaction, {{they may not be}} able to fully develop intersubjectivity, which impedes the development of more complex interpersonal communication. This article presents a review of 31 studies about intersubjectivity in children with <b>sensory</b> <b>disabilities.</b> The results indicate that the intersubjective development of children with <b>sensory</b> <b>disabilities</b> is often delayed. The studies also describe similar strategies for mediating intersubjectivity in children with <b>sensory</b> <b>disabilities</b> and in typical children, but say that specific adaptations may be needed. From an intersubjectivity perspective, symbolic communication delays in children with <b>sensory</b> <b>disabilities</b> may be improved through specific, purposeful forms of social interactio...|$|R

40|$|The {{goals of}} this study were twofold. The first aim was to compare {{loneliness}} prevalence in typically developing students, students with ASD and students with motor and/or <b>sensory</b> <b>disabilities</b> in mainstream 7 th grade in Belgium. The second aim was to explore the relations between number of friends, friendship quality, social self-concept {{on the one hand and}} loneliness on the other for each of these three groups, and to compare them across groups. In this study, 108 students with special educational needs (SEN; i. e., 58 students with ASD and 50 students with motor and/or <b>sensory</b> <b>disabilities)</b> were matched to 108 typically developing classmates. Students with ASD reported more loneliness than typically developing students and students with motor and/or <b>sensory</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Loneliness prevalence for typically developing students and students with motor and/or <b>sensory</b> <b>disabilities</b> did not differ significantly. Factors related with loneliness differed between typically developing students and students with SEN (i. e., students with ASD and students with motor and/or <b>sensory</b> <b>disabilities).</b> For students with SEN, same-sex social self-concept was related with loneliness, but not, as for typically developing students, number of friends and opposite-sex social self-concept. Also friendship quality had a marginally significant effect on loneliness feelings for students with SEN. Implications for further research and practice are discussed. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Parent-reported problem {{behaviors}} of 94 {{children with visual}} and auditory disabilities, attending elementary regular schools, were compared with problems reported in a general population sample of nondisabled children. Both samples were matched {{by means of a}} pairwise matching procedure, taking into account age and sex. Problem behavior was measured by Achenbach's (1991) CBCL (Achenbach, T. M. (1991). Manual for the Child Behavior Checklist/ 4 - 18 and 1991 Profile, University of Vermont, Department of Psychiatry, Burlington, VT). No significant main effects of type, degree, and nature of disability were found on the CBCL Total Problems scale, nor on the syndrome scales. In general, children with <b>sensory</b> <b>disabilities</b> attending elementary regular schools did not show more problems in comparison to nondisabled children. Merely on the Social Problems scale {{there was a significant difference}} between both samples, the children with <b>sensory</b> <b>disabilities</b> getting higher scores than their nondisabled peers. Further, children with <b>sensory</b> <b>disabilities</b> ran considerable risks of developing deviant scores on the Social Problems and the Thought Problems syndromes, the odds being respectively 3. 2 and 5. 2 times higher than in the general population sample.

This paper examines self-rated health scores and dimensions of functioning in people attending disability services and compares scores {{to the general population}} in Ireland, which has not been done before. METHODS: Face-to-face interviews were carried out with 247 adults with intellectual disability and 180 with physical or <b>sensory</b> <b>disability</b> attending regional residential, day activity, or training disability centres in the East Coast Area of Ireland. EuroQol ED- 5 Q was used to assess five dimensions of functioning and quality of life, supplemented by questions taken from the national population study on general health, mental health, and quality of life. RESULTS: Clients with intellectual disability scored their quality of life significantly higher than the adult general population. They scored their mental health significantly lower compared with clients with physical/sensory disability. Compared to clients with intellectual disability, and to the general population, clients with physical or <b>sensory</b> <b>disability</b> scored their quality of life significantly lower. They had more problems in all EuroQol ED- 5 Q dimensions (mobility; self-care; being able to carry out one's usual activities; pain; and anxiety) than both the general population and clients with intellectual disability. CONCLUSION: These results give an insight into self-rated health and quality of life of regional disability services attendees. Findings provide an indicator of health needs and provide a baseline to measure the impact of interventions. Further elucidation of the relationship between functional impairment and quality of life in those with disability is needed. Factors affecting self-rating of health in people with intellectual disabilities need further exploration.

40|$|Background: The {{key factor}} {{that affects the}} success of shaping {{positive}} attitudes towards regular life-long performance of physical activity (PA) is the pupils' level of inner motivation. This is influenced, among other things, by their family background, the educational institution that they attend and the educator's competencies. Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe and analyse the attitudes among pupils with <b>sensory</b> <b>disabilities</b> in physical education (PE) classes. A partial objective was to compare the preferences for various PA by pupils with <b>sensory</b> <b>disabilities</b> in PE classes. Method: A non-standardized questionnaire was used to collect the data. The sample was based on the following features: a) a participant had to be deaf or hard of hearing, b) a participant had to have a visual disability, and c) had to have been educated in special educational settings. The data were quantified on the percentage basis. To carry out cross-group statistical testing of differences, a ratio analysis with the help of the Chi-square test was applied. The level of statistical significance was set to p&#x 202 F;<&#x 202 F;. 05. We analysed the data of 70 pupils attending the second stage of two elementary schools in Slovakia: a) 37 pupils (22 boys and&#x 202 F; 15 girls, age 13. 3 &#x 202 F;±&#x 202 F; 1. 45 &#x 202 F;years) from a school for the deaf, and b) 33 pupils (14 boys and&#x 202 F; 19 girls, age 13. 4 &#x 202 F;±&#x 202 F; 1. 41 &#x 202 F;years) from a school for the blind. Results: The differences in the preferences for various PA during PE classes in the cross-group comparison of pupils with <b>sensory</b> <b>disabilities</b> were discovered. A comparison of the opinions of pupils with <b>sensory</b> <b>disabilities</b> pointed out a difference consisting in a higher percentage of positive attitudes among pupils with visual disabilities in indicators of popularity, importance, the pupils' efforts and feelings towards education. A statistically significant difference was discovered only in feelings during PE classes. This result may be considered proof of the suitability of the educational environment for pupils with visual disabilities. Conclusion: Comparing the opinions of pupils with <b>sensory</b> <b>disabilities</b> showed a difference in that pupils with visual disability have a higher percentage of positive views in all studied indicators: popularity, importance, pupils' efforts and their feelings towards PE...|$|R

It {{is important to understand}} the specific factors that affect instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and functional independence among older adults with <b>sensory</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Methods Nationally representative sample of adults aged 55 years and older with seeing or hearing disabilities were categorised into three sensory classifications: "Seeing Disabled but Hearing Abled" (SD-HA), "Hearing Disabled but Seeing Abled" (HD-SA), and both "Seeing and Hearing Disabled" (SD-HD). The additional category of "Seeing Disabled and/or Hearing Disabled" (SD and/or HD) was created to calculate the total of all individuals from the above categories who either had a seeing or hearing <b>disability</b> or both <b>sensory</b> <b>disabilities.</b> Respondents were asked to indicate whether they received assistance in performing seven IADL and their level of functional independence. Results The most common factors that affect IADL were heavy chores, grocery shopping and housework. Individuals with both seeing and hearing disabilities (SD-HD) reported having the most IADL restrictions, followed by individuals with only seeing disabilities (SD-HA) and only hearing disabilities (HD-SA). Individuals with severe <b>sensory</b> <b>disabilities</b> were generally more likely to report IADL restrictions and less likely to have decision-making control and be happy with their lives. In each sensory classification, females aged 55 – 64 years and 65 years and older reported more IADL restrictions than males.
