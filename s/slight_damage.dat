On 22 April she was bombed by two British Hudson aircraft and suffered <b>slight</b> <b>damage.</b> She returned to Wilhelmshaven the next day.|$|E
5|$|Buildings swayed {{with the}} tremor in Mexico City, {{prompting}} evacuations and causing panic among many. Following the quake, police patrolled city streets for safety reasons and damage assessments {{were carried out}} across the affected region. There were no casualties, though two local police stations suffered <b>slight</b> <b>damage.</b> A number of light aftershocks succeeded the main event, of which the strongest measured a magnitude of 4.1(ML).|$|E
5|$|Damage Sustained by the System. Contrary to {{what was}} done in other places, {{electricity}} was not shut down in Grand Cayman before arrival of the hurricane. Total system failure came at around 01:40 hours on 12 September. <b>Slight</b> <b>damage</b> was sustained by the North Sound Road power plant, and more extensive damage occurred in transmission lines and several substations {{as well as in}} distribution grids. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} submarine cable in the North Sound was damaged 1,500 feet offshore.|$|E

5|$|The {{third major}} action Hichens was {{involved}} in during this period was the action during the night of 21/22 April 1942, off Ostend, when they engaged six E boats, forcing the superior force to scatter and run for port after severely damaging one boat and causing <b>slight</b> <b>damage</b> to the others. After this action the E boats were moved to a safer harbour to operate from. Hichens was awarded a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) following this engagement.|$|E
5|$|Feth-i Bülend saw {{extensive}} {{service in}} the Black Sea during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, based primarily at Batumi. She {{took part in the}} bombardment of Russian positions and capture of the Black Sea port of Sokhumi on 14–16 May 1877. On 23 July, she engaged the Russian armed steamer Vesta in an inconclusive action. Poor visibility from smoke and escaping steam forced the ships to disengage, both with <b>slight</b> <b>damage</b> and few casualties. On the 31st, Feth-i Bülend and several other ships departed Batumi for Trabzon to bring ground troops to Varna to defend against an expected Russian attack across the Danube.|$|E
5|$|On 5 July {{she left}} Oran in Task Force (TF)81. The next day, she rendezvoused with TF85 and on 9 July stood off Gela, Sicily, {{disembarking}} troops into landing craft. On 11 July, she sustained <b>slight</b> <b>damage</b> in an enemy air attack and retired to Algeria with casualties and prisoners {{on board the}} next day. She returned to Sicily {{at the end of}} the month to discharge troops and cargo at Palermo and then, on the night of 1 August, weighed anchor and stood out for home.|$|E
50|$|After being hand-picked, the lemons are {{carefully}} transported to prevent even the <b>slightest</b> <b>damage</b> and, within {{a maximum of}} 24 hours of harvesting, they are peeled to obtain a very fine layer of zest, reducing the extraction of white pith as much as possible, to prevent the liqueur from having an excessively bitter after-taste.|$|R
5000|$|All four {{paintings}} {{have since been}} recovered. Monet's Poppies near Vétheuil and Van Gogh's Blossoming Chestnut Branches, were recovered on February 18, 2008 in a car parked at a nearby hospital's parking lot. Cézanne's [...] "The Boy in the Red Vest" [...] was recovered in Serbia on April 12, 2012. Count Lepic and His Daughters was recovered in April 2012 with <b>slight</b> <b>damages.</b> Three men were arrested {{in connection with the}} theft.|$|R
60|$|With {{the energy}} of despair he let fly an arrow with all his force; but the weak shaft glanced from the tapir's side without doing it the <b>slightest</b> <b>damage.</b> Then Martin turned to fly, {{but at the same}} moment the tapir did the same, to his great delight and surprise. It wheeled round with a snort, and went off {{crashing}} through the stout under-wood {{as if it had been}} grass, leaving a broad track behind it.|$|R
5|$|After Indiana {{returned}} to active duty, she {{participated in the}} invasion of Hollandia in western New Guinea. The ship then {{returned to}} the central Pacific and bombarded Truk, and subsequently took part in operations off the Marianas Islands. On 19 June 1944 a Japanese torpedo bomber attempted to attack the ship, but Indianas anti-aircraft gunners managed to destroy both the aircraft and the torpedo it had dropped, with no damage to the ship. Shortly thereafter, a second Japanese plane was shot down, but a third managed to crash into the ship. The aircraft disintegrated upon striking the side armor plates and scattered pieces of the plane across the stern. Five men were injured, but the ship suffered only very <b>slight</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{extensive}} damage resulting from the hurricane, where the Hornets would play for the 2005–06 season came into question. Although the New Orleans Arena suffered only <b>slight</b> <b>damage,</b> the flooding surrounding the area {{made it impossible to}} use. With the training camp scheduled to begin on October 4, the team announced that the first three weeks of camp would be held at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado, instead of their usual location, Alario Center in Westwego. Additionally the team stated that they wanted to play home games within Louisiana, at either the Pete Maravich Assembly Center or the Rivercenter in Baton Rouge. On September 3, Hornets owner George Shinn stated that the storm would not be used as a reason to permanently relocate the franchise.|$|E
5|$|York City {{leased land}} at Bootham Crescent from York Cricket Club as a {{replacement}} for their ground at Fulfordgate, which was {{on the outskirts of the}} city. The ground was constructed in four months, and officially opened on 31 August 1932. During the Second World War, the Popular Stand was converted into an air-raid shelter, and the ground suffered <b>slight</b> <b>damage</b> when a bomb landed on houses along the Shipton Street End. York purchased Bootham Crescent for £4,075 in September 1948. Floodlights were fitted at the ground in 1959, and were replaced by ones twice as powerful in 1995. A number of improvements were made in the early 1980s, with a gymnasium, offices and a lounge for officials built.|$|E
5|$|After the war many castles were <b>slighted,</b> <b>damaged</b> to {{put them}} beyond {{military}} use, but Parliament {{was concerned about the}} threat of a royalist invasion from Scotland and Beaumaris was spared. Colonel John Jones became the castle governor and a garrison was installed inside, at a cost of £1,703 a year. When Charles II returned to the throne in 1660 and restored the Bulkeley family as castle constables, Beaumaris appears to have been stripped of its valuable lead and remaining resources, including the roofs.|$|R
50|$|In 1895, {{designed}} by Ludwig Klingenberg (1840-1924) in the French Renaissance style, the Bremen Court House (Landgericht Bremen) was completed. It suffered only <b>slight</b> war <b>damage</b> in 1944.|$|R

She has gone through a tornado without having {{suffered}} the <b>slightest</b> <b>damage,</b> except the loss of the dinghy. I shall be getting the topmast up in another hour. You see, I have got her number-two jib on her and shifted the mizzen, but she is still a bit too lively to make it safe to get up the spar. Like as not, if we did, it would snap off before we could get the stays taut." ...|$|R
5|$|Bootham Crescent was renovated {{over the}} summer of 1932; the Main and Popular Stands were built and {{terraces}} were banked up behind the goals. The ground was officially opened on 31 August 1932, for York's 2–2 draw with Stockport County in the Third Division North. It was played before 8,106 supporters, and York's Tom Mitchell scored the first goal at the ground. There were teething problems in Bootham Crescent's early years: attendances were not higher than at Fulfordgate in its first four seasons, and there were questions over {{the quality of the}} pitch. In March 1938 the ground's record attendance was set when 28,123 people watched York play Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup. The ground endured <b>slight</b> <b>damage</b> during the Second World War, when bombs were dropped on houses along the Shipton Street End. Improvements were made shortly after the war ended, including the concreting of the banking at the Grosvenor Road End being completed.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Carol {{was among}} the worst {{tropical}} cyclones on record to affect the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island in the United States. It developed from a tropical wave near the Bahamas on August 25, 1954, and slowly strengthened as it moved northwestward. On August 27, Carol intensified to reach winds of 105mph (165km/h), but weakened as its motion turned to a northwest drift. A strong trough of low pressure turned the hurricane northeastward, and Carol later intensified into a major hurricane. While paralleling the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern United States, the storm produced strong winds and rough seas that caused minor coastal flooding and <b>slight</b> <b>damage</b> to houses in North Carolina, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Delaware, and New Jersey. The well-organized hurricane accelerated north-northeastward and made landfall on eastern Long Island, New York, and then over eastern Connecticut on August31 with sustained winds estimated at 110-mph and a barometric pressure near 956 mb. Carol transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over New Hampshire later on August 31, 1954.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{believed}} they had struck a mortal blow against the ALA. German post-operation analysis indicated a resounding success. It suggested {{a long list of}} wrecked French factories and destroyed aircraft on the ground and in the air. The Germans claimed to have destroyed 75 French aircraft in the air and 400 on the ground. Such was the perceived success, the Luftwaffe concentrated against ports on the northern French coast thereafter. The damage inflicted by the Luftwaffe was far less than the Germans thought. Only 20 French aircraft (16 of them fighters) were destroyed on the ground and 15 of their fighters were shot down in aerial combat, a loss rate of 19 percent, suggesting German over claiming of over 4:1 in the air and 16:1 on the ground. Six of the sixteen airfields hit reported serious damage, while fifteen factories reported <b>slight</b> <b>damage.</b> French casualties on the ground were heavy, including 254 dead and 652 injured. The French shot down 10 German aircraft, including four bombers. They claimed 16, suggesting mutual over claiming. A further 21 vehicles were destroyed. All the French airfields were back in operation 48 hours later.|$|E

500|$|Civil {{war broke}} out in England in 1642 between the rival factions of the Royalists and Parliament. Cambridge Castle was {{occupied}} by Parliamentary forces {{in the first year}} of the war. Oliver Cromwell ordered emergency work to be conducted to repair the defences, resulting in two new earthwork bastions being added to the castle and a brick barracks constructed in the old bailey. The governor of Cambridge described in 1643 that [...] "our town and castle are now very strongly fortified... with breastworks and bulwarks". The castle saw no further fighting during the war, and in 1647 parliament ordered the remaining fortifications to be <b>slighted,</b> <b>damaged</b> beyond further use.|$|R
50|$|The {{success of}} Leopoldus Primus is {{supported}} by many reports. Captain Berend Jacobsen Karpfanger took her {{through a number of}} successful battles against pirates. One highlight is Karpfanger's defense against five French ships in the Elbe estuary on 11 September 1678. Fifty whaling ships were returning to Hamburg from Greenland when the frigates attacked. After a 12-hour battle, two of the French frigates were sunk and the rest put to flight. None of the Hamburg ships were lost, although Leopoldus Primus sustained <b>slight</b> <b>damages.</b> Only two of the crew of Leopoldus were killed, with one man injured. In other activities, the ship was used in 1686 to protect Hamburg from Denmark.|$|R
5|$|The Luftwaffe {{began its}} eighth {{consecutive}} night of bombing London on 15 September. Soon after midnight, 13 unidentified Dornier Do 17 light bombers attacked the capital. At 00:15 two Junkers Ju 88s followed from Kampfgeschwader 51 (KG 51, or 51st Bomber Wing). A further 11 Heinkel He 111s from an unidentified unit bombed the city again at 00:50. At 02:00, five He 111s from Kampfgeschwader 4 (KG 4) bombed the city. A full strike by the Geschwader had been planned, but bad weather had forced a cancellation after five He 111s had taken off. Most {{of the damage}} was done to residential areas in Fulham, Chelsea and Westminster. Around 19 {{people were killed and}} 31 injured. The heaviest casualties were caused when a bomb fell on a church in Chelsea killing 14 and injuring 26. Small raiding forces bombed Cardiff, Bootle (in Liverpool), Leicester and Ipswich. At Bootle, only <b>slight</b> <b>damage</b> was done to rail tracks and facilities at West Alexandra Dock.|$|E
5|$|Through late September, Caltech seismometers {{recorded}} 188 aftershocks {{higher than}} magnitude 4.0. Six {{of those on}} the day of the mainshock were M5 and above, but some of these (like the 12:05 M6.3 shock) were only felt, and didn't cause any damage. The July 21 M5.1 shock at 15:13 GMT and the July 23 shock at 00:38 both damaged buildings in Arvin, and the latter event also caused <b>slight</b> <b>damage</b> in Fresno and near Bakersfield. Three additional shocks on July 23 were particularly destructive. Walls and other portions of buildings that had been previously damaged took a second hit from the 07:53 M5.2 event, and a house that saw only minor damage during the mainshock was nearly destroyed by it. Gas and water lines were also severed, and transformers were loosened or dislodged. The 13:17 M5.8 shock compounded problems at Tehachapi and Arvin with damage to previously-affected buildings that was described as serious, but the 18:13 shock on July 23 only had a slight affect at Arvin.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Kim, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Osang, was the second typhoon in a week to {{directly}} affect the Philippines during July1980. Like Typhoon Joe, Kim formed from the near equatorial monsoon trough in the northwestern Pacific Ocean on July19. The disturbance tracked quickly westward-northwest underneath a subtropical ridge, reaching tropical storm strength on the July21 and typhoon strength on July23. After developing an eye, Kim began to rapidly intensify, and during the afternoon of July24, peaked in intensity as a super typhoon. Several hours later, Kim made landfall over the Philippines, but the storm had weakened considerably by this time. Throughout the Philippines, 40people were killed, 2 via drownings, and 19,000 others were directly affected. A total of 12,000homes were destroyed and 5,000villages were flooded. Less than a week earlier, the same areas were affected by Joe; however, Kim was considered the more damaging of the two typhoons. Land interaction took its toll on Kim, and upon entering the South China Sea, the storm was down below typhoon intensity. Kim continued northwestward but its disrupted circulation prevented re-intensification, and it remained a tropical storm until hitting southern China July27 to the northeast of Hong Kong, where only <b>slight</b> <b>damage</b> was reported. Later that day, Kim dissipated.|$|E

While leaving port in Hong Kong during the deployment, she collided with the Panamanian-registered cargo ship Sei Bright. Sei Bright suffered <b>slight</b> <b>damaged</b> to her bow. No one was injured on either ship nor did Drum suffer notable damaged. Drum returned to San Diego on 13 April 1995. Commander Hall was relieved of duty pending investigation of the collision, later resolved as [...] "not for cause." [...] On 27 April 1995, Commander Mitchell K.

2500|$|Lieutenant William Peake {{commissioned}} her in July 1798. Under his command, Eling {{took part}} in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland in 1799. On 28 August 1799, the fleet captured several Dutch hulks and ships in the New Diep, in Holland. Eling was not listed among the vessels qualifying to share in the prize money. However, Eling was present at the subsequent Vlieter Incident on 30 August. In discussing the utility of the [...] "non-recoil principle" [...] of fixing carronades to the deck, James mentions that during the Vlieter Incident Eling fired some 400 shots from her aftermost carronade without sustaining the <b>slightest</b> <b>damage</b> to even a pane of glass in the cabin skylight, or injury to anyone.|$|R
5|$|Saturday evening's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for twenty minutes and eliminated the cars that finished the session eighteenth or lower. The second part of qualifying lasted fifteen minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions eleven to seventeen. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final qualifying session {{were not allowed to}} change tyres before the race; these started the race fitted with the tyres with which they set their quickest lap times. It was held in dry weather conditions. Alonso was fastest in the first and third sessions, and clinched his second consecutive pole position with a lap time of 1:45.390 which he set on his first run of the third session. He was restricted to one timed lap in the second session because of an engine mapping problem, which meant Ferrari immediately re-programmed Alonso's engine upon discovering the issue. Alonso was joined on the front row of the grid by Vettel, who recorded a lap 0.067seconds off Alonso's pace, and felt he could have taken pole position as he misjudged a gap while following Schumacher and brushed the wall exiting the Singapore Sling chicane. Hamilton qualified third and was happy with his starting position despite losing downforce on the track's final sector while running in teammate Button's tow. Button secured fourth and pushed hard in the final session which meant he had <b>slight</b> <b>damage</b> to his rear tyres on his first run, and could not get the optimum tyre temperature in the first section on his second run. Webber managed fifth and admitted that he was struggling to find a good rhythm when driving the circuit. Barrichello qualified in sixth. The two Mercedes drivers took seventh and ninth; Rosberg ahead of Schumacher. Rosberg believed that he should have performed better in qualifying than in the practice session, as he felt the soft tyres lacked grip; Schumacher was satisfied with his qualifying performance. The Mercedes drivers were separated by Kubica, in the faster Renault, who was happy with his lap time despite his car sliding from a lack of grip. Kobayashi rounded out the top ten qualifiers.|$|E

60|$|The {{change in}} the course of the vessel was by no means {{appreciated}} by the passengers, for the motion was very much rougher and more unpleasant than that to which they had now become accustomed. However, by the following morning the wind had died away to a moderate breeze, and the sea had very sensibly abated. The topsails were shaken out of their reefs; and although the motion was still violent most of the passengers emerged from their cabins and came on deck to enjoy the sun, which was now streaming brightly through the broken clouds. The captain was in high glee; the ship had weathered the gale without the <b>slightest</b> <b>damage.</b> Not a rope had parted, not a sail been blown away, and the result fully justified the confidence he felt in his ship and her gear.|$|R
