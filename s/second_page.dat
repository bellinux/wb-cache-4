5|$|Cabaniss' {{body was}} ordered to be embalmed but was not; the damage to his body was so severe that the {{embalming}} fluid would leak out. His body was buried in Kobe on February 24 with military honors. The entire crew of the Swatara attended, {{as well as the}} entire crew of HMS Flying Fish and many noted Japanese citizens. Ensign Parker reportedly suffered from depression following the accident. Cabaniss' death received significant media coverage in the Eastern United States. The New York Times published an article on its <b>second</b> <b>page,</b> and among other papers that carried the story were the Wilmington Morning Star and the Petersburg Index-Appeal.|$|E
5|$|The {{agreement}} {{to withdraw the}} special police and the JNA largely restored status quo ante bellum. 17 of the 32 arrested policemen returned to service by 5 March; charges were eventually filed against five, including Vezmar. The incident had a lasting significance {{because it was the}} first serious skirmish in what would become the Croatian War of Independencea full-scale war between Croatia and its rebel Serb population supported by Serbia and the JNA. The Serbian government used the Pakrac clash to strengthen nationalist propaganda claims that Croatia was committing genocide against its Serb population. Up to 40 deaths from the clash were reported by Serbian and Montenegrin media outlets. In an indication of the confused and highly inaccurate nature of the reporting, the Belgrade daily newspaper Večernje novosti reported on its front page that the town's Orthodox priest had been killed, on its <b>second</b> <b>page</b> that he had been wounded, and on its third page it printed a statement from him. The Yugoslav presidency finally issued a statement that nobody had been killed in Pakrac.|$|E

25|$|Asides from waging wars {{against the}} Chinese empire's navy and the Hinduized polities among their {{immediate}} neighbors, Madja-as {{was also in}} a state of intermittent conflict with the Kingdom of Tondo in Luzon and the Sultanate of Sulu in Mindanao. Sulu and Tondo (Both Vassals of the Bruneian Empire) considered Madja-as a formidable nation that, after some time, a certain Timway Orangkaya Su'il was mentioned by the <b>second</b> <b>page</b> of tarsila (of the Sulu Sultanate), said that he received four Bisaya slaves (People from the Confederation of Madja-as) from Manila (presumably Dynasty of Tondo) as a sign of friendship between the two countries.

25|$|On the <b>second</b> <b>page,</b> {{the rich}} golden burial {{sites of the}} Zenú are described, {{as well as the}} routes inland from later Venezuela, that was conquered by German conquistadors. The next {{paragraph}} narrates about the start of the main expedition inland from Santa Marta, leaving the city in the month of April 1536. It is said Gonzalo Ximénez de Quesada left with 600 men, divided into 8 groups of infantry, 10 groups of cavalry and a number of brigs on the Magdalena River. De Quesada and his troops marched over land {{on the bank of the}} river. Names of the captains in the army of De Quesada are given as San Martín (Juan de Sanct Martín), Céspedes (Juan de Céspedes), Valençuela (Pedro Fernández de Valenzuela), Lázaro Fonte, Librixa (Antonio de Lebrija), Juan de(l) Junco and Suarex (Gonzalo Suárez Rendón). The captains heading the brigs are named as Corral (Francisco Gómez del Corral), Cardosso (Antonio Díaz de Cardoso) and Albarracín (Juan de Albarracín). The troops went out of free will and consent of the governor of Santa Marta; Pedro de Lugo, after the death of García de Lerma. The troops went under command of Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada. The third page describes that the troops spent more than a year and more than 100 leguas on their journey. They reached La Tora , farther than any soldier had gone before, after 150 leguas. The expedition took so long because of the waters and the narrow passages of the surrounding area.|$|E

DVD sales were successful, selling 1,412,865 DVD units {{in the first week}} of release which translated to $27,683,818 in revenue.

500|$|In Eric Shanower's graphic novel Age of Bronze, {{currently}} {{still being}} serialised, Troilus is youthful {{but not the}} youngest son of Priam and Hecuba. In the first two collected volumes of {{this version of the}} Trojan War, Shanower provides a total of six pages of sources covering the story elements of his work alone. These include most of the fictional works discussed above from Guido and Boccaccio down to Morley and Walton. Shanower begins Troilus' love story with the youth making fun of Polyxena's love for Hector and in the process accidentally knocking aside Cressida's veil. He follows the latter into the temple of Athena to gawp at her. Pandarus is the widow Cressida's uncle encouraging him. Cressida rejects Troilus' initial advances not because of wanting to act in a seemly manner, as in Chaucer or Shakespeare, but because she thinks of him as just a boy. However, her uncle persuades her to encourage his affection, in the hope that being close to a son of Priam will protect against the hostility of the Trojans to the family of the traitor Calchas. Troilus' unrequited love is used as comic relief in an otherwise serious retelling of the Trojan War cycle. The character is portrayed as often indecisive and ineffectual as on the <b>second</b> <b>page</b> of this episode sample at the official site [...] It {{remains to be seen how}} Shanower will further develop the story.|$|E
