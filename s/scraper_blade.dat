A <b>scraper</b> <b>blade,</b> which serves to redirect the filter cake into the discharge chute, removes the cake from the filter cloth just before re-entering the vat.

50|$|By {{raising the}} dozer blade and using its <b>scraper</b> <b>blade,</b> the ACE can fill itself with ballast to improve dozing efficiency. Another key {{feature of the}} M9 is its {{hydropneumatic}} suspension system. The principal components are eight high-pressure hydraulic rotary actuators (four on each side) which connect to the roadwheel stations. During high-speed travel, this system assures a smooth ride {{through the use of}} shock-absorbing accumulators. In earthmoving operations, the operator rotates the actuators, thus lowering the apron and blade for digging.|$|E
50|$|During {{the washing}} stage, the wash liquid {{can either be}} poured onto the drum or sprayed on the cake. Cake {{pressing}} is optional but its advantages are preventing cake cracking and removing more moisture. Cake discharge is when all the solids are removed {{from the surface of}} the cake by a <b>scraper</b> <b>blade,</b> leaving a clean surface as drum re-enters the slurry 6. There are a few types of discharge which are scraper, roller, string, endless belt and pre coat.5 The filtrate and air flow through internal pipes, valve and into the vacuum receiver where the separation of liquid and gas occurs producing a clear filtrate 7. Pre coat filtration is an ideal method to produce a high clarity of filtrate. Basically, the drum surface is pre coated with a filter aid such as diatomaceous earth (DE) or perlite to improve filtration and increase cake permeability. It then undergoes the same process cycle as the conventional rotary vacuum drum filter however, pre coat filtration uses a higher precision blade to scrape off the cake 6.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A more {{effective}} of cooling method {{is necessary for}} fish storage to get high quality and long freshness of fish. Ice block is not sufficient for fish storage because of its hard-solid surface that can damage the fish. Moreover for some remote area {{it is difficult to}} find ice block in good time with reasonable/low price. One solution for this problem is the usage of sea-water ice slurry for fish cooling. Ice slurry is formed when the sea-water temperature goes down to its freezing point, when the early nucleation is formed. Crystal ice can be formed when chemical equilibrium is occurred. The purpose of this present study is to observe the characteristics of ice slurry generation using <b>scraper</b> <b>blade</b> evaporator and orbital rod evaporator.

A dozen trench complexes were excavated at the northern plains landing site and 31 samples (including water-ice-bearing soils) were acquired for delivery to instruments on the Lander during the 152 sol mission. Deliveries included sprinkling material from several centimeters height to break up cloddy soils on impact with instrument portals. Excavations were done {{on the side of}} the Humpty Dumpty and the top of the Wonderland polygons, and in nearby troughs. Resistive forces encountered during backhoe operations show that soils above the 3 – 5 cm deep icy soil interfaces are stronger with increasing depth. Further, soils are similar in appearance and properties to the weakly cohesive crusty and cloddy soils imaged and excavated by the Viking Lander 2, which also landed on the northern plains. Adsorbed H 2 O is inferred to be responsible for the variable nature and cohesive strength of the soils. Backhoe blade chatter marks on excavated icy soil surfaces, combined with rasp motor currents, are consistent with laboratory experiments using grain-supported icy soil deposits, as is the relatively rapid decrease in icy soil strength over time as the ice sublimated on Mars...|$|E

Specifically, the current design incorporates a highly conducting material (copper) in the blade structure interfacing with the platinum scraper and is responsible for conducting the deposited energy away from the beam interception region.
