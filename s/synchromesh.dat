25|$|The non-Cooper {{cars had}} {{gearboxes}} with the “magic wand” selector, with 4-speeds (no <b>synchromesh</b> on 1st) while the Coopers has a remote shift selector.|$|E
25|$|The {{improved}} frame {{consisted of}} fully boxed rails and crossmembers, {{instead of the}} 1750s C-shaped sections. A new four-speed gearbox was fitted, with <b>synchromesh</b> on the two top gears and a freewheel mechanism.|$|E
25|$|The PS2 {{followed}} the PD2 Titan in having the 125bhp 9.8-litre O600 engine {{and a new}} <b>synchromesh</b> gearbox. With changes to rules on width and length there were numerous {{different versions of the}} home market PS2 based on permutations of width and length, whether built with or without a rear dropped frame and whether reconstructed from short-wheelbase chassis or built new to the longer wheelbase. PS2/1, 3, 5 and 7 had a 17ft 6in wheelbase for 27ft 6in bodywork. PS2/10, 11, 12, 12A, 13, 13A, 14 and 15 had a longer wheelbase of 18ft 9in for 30ft long coachwork (but see later about the six-wheel PS2/10 and /11). The entire home market Tiger range was vacuum-braked and PS2s for the UK had the <b>synchromesh</b> gearbox only, whilst the Titan PD2 had a number of options including constant-mesh, AEC preselector and Pneumocyclic. The last new PS2 coaches entered service in 1953 with West Riding Automobile Company, and the last home-market customer for the Tiger PS2 bus was the Burnley, Colne and Nelson Joint Transport Committee, their last arrived in 1955 and put in 20 years and more of work, thus being the last half-cab single deckers on normal service in the UK.|$|E
5|$|The {{transmission}} system featured triple-cone <b>synchromeshing</b> on {{first and second}} gears to handle rapid starts, whilst remaining relatively easy for the driver to engage and providing positive feel.|$|R
5000|$|The Jeep Truck was {{available}} {{with only one}} transmission, the Borg-Warner T-90 three-speed manual, with <b>synchromeshed</b> second and third gears. A Spicer/Dana 18 transfer case was used on four-wheel drive models. The heavy duty Timken 51540 {{was used in the}} early years of production, later being replaced by the Dana 53. The front axle was a Dana 25 ...|$|R
50|$|The pre-war European car {{market was}} not one market. Trade {{barriers}} fragmented it into national markets, apart from luxury cars where the extra cost of tariffs could actually make cars more exclusive and desirable. The only way for a car maker to enter another national market of a major European car making country, (and their colonial markets of the time), was to open factories there. For example, Citroen and Renault opened factories in England in this period. This situation only really changed with the post-war growth of the EEC (European Community) and EFTA. The British RAC (Royal Automobile Club) horsepower taxation system had the secondary function of excluding foreign vehicles. It was specifically targeted at the Ford Model T, which the then government feared would wipe out the fledgling indigenous motor industry. It crippled car engine design in Britain in the inter-war period, causing British car makers to produce under-square, low revving, long stroke engines. It was abolished after World War II {{as part of the}} British export drive for desperately needed, hard foreign currency, because it made British cars uncompetitive internationally. The technologically conservative 1930s Morris Eight, Ford Eight (Ford Model Y which was related to the German Ford Köln), and Standard Eight (Standard, later became Triumph) were named after their RAC horsepower car tax rating. The Ford Model Y had replaced the Model A in Europe in 1932 and ran until 1937. It was a much smaller and lighter car weighing a third less, with an engine two thirds smaller in capacity than the Model A. The basic Model Y 'Popular' was an important milestone in British economy cars, being the first steel-bodied four-seater saloon to sell for £100; previously the only four-wheeled car to sell for that price had been the two-seater tourer model of the Morris Minor. The Model Y was reworked into the more streamlined Ford 7Y for 1938-1939. This was restyled again into the 1939 launched Ford Anglia. Initial sales in Britain actually began in early 1940. Production was suspended in early 1942, and resumed in mid-1945. Production ceased in 1948 after a total of 55,807 had been built. The Anglia was restyled again in 1948. Including all production, 108,878 were built. When production as an Anglia ceased in October 1953, it continued as the extremely basic Ford Popular entry level car until 1959. The Ford Prefect was a differently styled and slightly more upmarket version of the Anglia launched in October 1938 and remained in production until 1941, returning to the market in 1945. The car was face lifted in 1953 from its original perpendicular or sit-up-and-beg style to a more modern three-box structure. It was sold until 1961. The Anglia, Popular and Prefect sold well for a long time despite their old fashioned technology using transverse leaf springs and beam axles for front and rear suspension, side valve engines and only partly <b>synchromeshed</b> three speed gearboxes. They sold on price because of limited car supply on the used car market due to the Second World War, and new car market because of the British government's post war policy of exporting cars. The Morris Eight, introduced in 1935, was a deliberate close copy of the Ford and served as a lower cost, more profitable replacement for the 1928-vintage Morris Minor which had not achieved the hoped-for success. Prices for the Morris started at £112 and it offered more equipment than the Ford and a much more modern design than the ageing Austin Seven, which meant it became the UK's bestselling car by 1939.|$|R
25|$|The export range, from 1948 {{were the}} OPS2, OPS3 and OPS4. They also {{featured}} the O600 engine and <b>synchromesh</b> gearbox as introduced, but air brakes were optional. The OPS2 shared the PS2's 17ft 6in wheelbase, although the frames, springs and axles were heavier duty than their home market equivalents, bodies {{could be as}} long as 29ft 3in where laws permitted, the OPS3 was introduced {{at the same time}} as the OPS2 but had a 19ft wheelbase for bodies up to 31ft long. This variant would not have met UK turning circle requirements when the new 30ft length was legalised in 1950. Córas Iompair Éireann (CIÉ), the Irish state transport undertaking uniquely took Tigers of both PS2/13 and OPS3 type, these become the last vehicles of over 300 to be numbered in the P series that had started with Dublin United Transport's first Tiger in 1935. Walter Alexander took some OPS2 coaches as well as PS2s but these are believed to have been a frustrated export order. The OPS4, had a 21ft 6in wheelbase for a bodied length of 35ft, Duple produced a batch of fifteen LOPS4/3 with Park Royal metal frames in 1949 for coach operators in Buenos Aires and a single coach to the same outline for Gibraltar motorways. Production of the 'overseas' Tiger concentrated in the 1950s on the OPS4/5 variant with exposed radiator, O680 engine, air brakes and Pneumocyclic gearbox as standard, the final (post 1967) versions were coded OPS4A/15 following updates in the Titan range and a rationalisation of nomenclature and components. The last Tiger OPS4s were delivered to South African fleets in 1970, some of these were still working at the turn of the century.|$|E
500|$|It had a Spicer manual <b>synchromesh</b> transmission, {{with one}} reverse and five forward gears. The {{suspension}} was VVSS for earlier variants, and HVSS for variants demarcated with an A1. It had between [...] of armor depending on location. It had an armament {{that consisted of}} an 81mm mortar, which was used to cover emergency retreats, and a [...] M2 Browning machine gun combined with a [...] M1919 machine gun. There were 20 hand grenades (Fragmentation Mk.II), and six smoke grenades in the crew compartment. The armament was used only for self-defense, as the vehicle was not designed {{to be used as}} an offensive weapon.|$|E
2500|$|Britain {{pioneered the}} use of petrol powered, 4-wheel <b>synchromesh</b> {{mechanical}} drive locomotives (known as tractors) for daylight use within visual range of the front. In 1916 the War Office required [...] "Petrol Trench Tractors" [...] of 600-mm gauge that were capable of drawing 10 to 15 tons at [...] per hour. [...] Early tractors weighed 2 tons. Total production was 102 [...] Ernest E. Baguley tractors, 580 [...] Motor Rail tractors and 220 [...] Motor Rail tractors. An additional two-hundred [...] petrol-electric tractors were produced by British Westinghouse and Dick, Kerr & Co..|$|E
2500|$|The base {{two-seater}} {{model was}} discontinued, having sold 3,017 units in 18 months. Gremlins also switched from non-synchronized 1st gear manual transmissions to full <b>synchromesh,</b> and the Borg-Warner-sourced automatic transmission {{was replaced by}} the Chrysler-designed TorqueFlite. Other more minor technical upgrades improved the car's reliability and durability. The Gremlin X package continued to be popular, while optional features now included an AM/FM radio, fabric sunroof, tilt steering wheel, inside hood release, trailer towing package for up to [...] with a Class 1 hitch, as well as manual or power assisted front disk brakes.|$|E
2500|$|They were unpopular {{with the}} drivers {{for a variety}} of reasons, including: the <b>synchromesh</b> {{gearboxes}} required a lot more work to operate compared to the pre-selector gearboxes in the older buses; the separation of the driver's cab from the passenger compartment made visibility and fare collection difficult; and it was often necessary to exit the vehicle many times per shift using a small side door into the path of oncoming traffic to perform routine tasks. [...] However, compared to the Ford V8s, they were more powerful, had better brakes, and were more reliable.|$|E
2500|$|The engine {{continued}} at 1296 cc, but in 1973 was modified with larger big-end bearings to rationalize production with the TR6 2.5 litre engines, which somewhat decreased its [...] "revvy" [...] nature; {{there was some}} detuning, to meet new emissions laws, {{which resulted in the}} new car being a little tamer. With the overall weight also increasing to [...] the performance dropped as a consequence, 0 to [...] now being achieved in 15.8 seconds and the top speed reducing to [...] The overall fuel economy also dipped to 32mpg. The gearbox gained <b>synchromesh</b> on its bottom gear.|$|E
2500|$|Its overall {{shape is}} of a roundish profile, soon nicknamed [...] "Daruma" [...] for a Japanese {{roly-poly}} doll - {{this is the}} smallest (and arguably the only Kei Jidosha) car to use the [...] "coke bottle styling" [...] which became popular in the United States for the 1965 model year. The wheelbase was , the suspension independent with coil springs and the engine was an all new 356cc three-cylinder air-cooled two-cycle unit which was also called the LC10. The transmission was a four-speed manual, originally with <b>synchromesh</b> on the top three gears only. In a break with Fronte's front-wheel drive traditions, the powertrain was placed transversely in the rear, as was becoming the norm for kei cars of the period. The LC10 Fronte was dubbed the [...] "Queen of the keis" [...] by Suzuki's marketing department - a claim which may have influenced Subaru to name their 360 replacement the [...] "Rex".|$|E
2500|$|The bus was {{available}} {{with a choice}} of six-cylinder diesel engines, either the Leyland O.400 (later replaced [...] by the Leyland O.401) or the Perkins H6.354. The 5.8 litre H6.354 produced 101bhp; the 6.54 litre O.400 had a peak output of 125bhp whilst the 0.401 (from 1971) produced 138bhp. The usual gearbox was a Turner-Clark <b>synchromesh</b> five-speed model with overdrive top gear. The front and rear axles were sourced from British Leyland's Bathgate factory. Some buses were fitted with a SCG semi-automatic transmission and power steering. The engine was positioned in the centre of the chassis but its relatively high position meant that several steps were needed in the entrance. This was arranged in the overhang ahead of the front wheels allowing one-man operation (as it was known in those days) with the driver taking the fares and issuing tickets as passengers boarded. A small number of LH's, for Lancashire United Transport, Hants & Dorset and the Midland General group were also fitted with a central exit doorway. The radiator was positioned {{at the front of the}} chassis. The suspension was by half-elliptical leaf springs, although BCV had offered pneumatic suspension on heavier buses since 1962.|$|E
2500|$|The 1966 lineup {{remained}} essentially unchanged from 1965. One {{change of}} note {{was a new}} four-speed <b>synchromesh</b> transmission using the standard Saginaw gear set with 3.11:1 first gear ratio used by other GM 6-cylinder vehicles. The steering column was changed to a two-piece design with universal joint, lessening the danger of intrusion during a front-end collision (actually a mid-1965 running change). [...] A plastic air dam was installed below the front valence panel to conceal the front suspension and underbody, and lessen crosswind sensitivity. In front, The [...] "lock door" [...] emblem (covering the lockset for the trunk lock) was changed from red to blue and featured a shorter bar. Air conditioned cars received a new condenser that was mounted {{in front of the}} engine, eliminating previous efficient but huge, awkward condenser that was mounted atop the engine, requiring its removal out of the way for most underhood servicing. The Corvair script nameplate was moved from atop the trunk lid to a position next to the driver's side headlight bezel. Sales began a decline as a result of Nader's book and the new Mustang that offered V8s up to [...] compared to Corvair's [...] top powertrain. and rumors of the upcoming [...] "Panther'-the code name for the forthcoming Camaro, slated as a direct competitor for the Mustang. A decision was made to discontinue further development of the Corvair. Production for the model year was down to 103,743.|$|E
2500|$|The Series III had {{the same}} body and engine options as the {{preceding}} IIa, including station wagons and the 1 Ton versions. Little changed cosmetically from the IIA to the Series III. The Series III {{is the most common}} Series vehicle, with 440,000 of the type built from 1971 to 1985. The headlights were moved to the wings on late production IIA models from 1968/9 onward (ostensibly to comply with Australian, American and Dutch lighting regulations) and remained in this position for the Series III. The traditional metal grille, featured on the Series I, II and IIA, was replaced with a plastic one for the Series III model. The 2.25-litre engine had its compression raised from 7:1 to 8:1, increasing the power slightly (the high compression engine had been an optional fit on the IIa model for several years). During the Series III production run from 1971 until 1985, the 1,000,000th Land Rover rolled off the production line in 1976. The Series III saw many changes in the later part of its life as Land Rover updated the design to meet increased competition. This was the first model to feature <b>synchromesh</b> on all four gears, although some late H-suffix SIIA models (mainly the more expensive Station Wagons) had used the all-synchro box. In keeping with early 1970s trends in automotive interior design, both in safety and use of more advanced materials, the simple metal dashboard of earlier models was redesigned to accept a new moulded plastic dash. The instrument cluster, which was previously centrally located, was moved to the driver's side. Long-wheelbase Series III vehicles had the Salisbury rear axle (the differential housing and axle case are one piece) as standard, although some late SIIA [...] vehicles had them too.|$|E
5000|$|A further {{series of}} codes were raised late in 1954, presumably to extend {{lightweight}} features {{to the rest}} of the range. They were all <b>synchromesh,</b> but Leyland had as standard removed <b>synchromesh</b> engagement from second gear, this only available as an option, due to excessive wear, which Leyland credited to driver-abuse.
