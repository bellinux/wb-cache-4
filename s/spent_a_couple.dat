5|$|Mölders {{and members}} of JG 53 <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of weeks of R skiing in the Vorarlberg before {{continuing}} operations against the RAF over the Channel and occupied France during early 1941. His new wingman from January 1941 was Oberleutnant Hartmann Grasser. Mölders claimed his first aerial victory after the lengthy vacation on 10 February 1941; his tally reached 60 on 26 February and stood at 68 when the Geschwader was recalled from the Channel front. His logbook showed 238 combat missions plus an additional 71 reconnaissance flights; he had engaged in aerial combat 70 times.|$|E
5|$|We were in {{a studio}} in New York, this place called the Magic Shop, and it had this thing called a tack piano there, which sounds like an old honky-tonk piano, where you put little tacks in the hammers, so it sounds like more of a {{harpsichord}} almost. And {{so we wanted to}} use that kind of sound, but we didn't have a tack piano, so rather than sample it, we went and bought an old piano from the shop up the road from our studio, and we bought a load of tacks, and me and Guy and Jon <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of hours pushing tacks into the piano hammers.|$|E

50|$|Jung's daily {{practice}} {{time as a}} child was one to two hours long when there was school, and up to three hours during school breaks. Jung usually took an hour {{to figure out the}} notes and fingering to a piece, and typically took another five hours to practice before recording. However, to make his songs better and more accurate, he occasionally <b>spent</b> from <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> days up to a month practicing.|$|R
2500|$|Ashcroft {{reunited with}} Jones and Salisbury {{just a few}} weeks after the break-up, but McCabe did not rejoin them. The new band hired former Suede guitarist Bernard Butler, but he <b>spent</b> only <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of days with the band. The band then chose Simon Tong, a school friend {{credited}} with originally teaching Ashcroft and Jones to play guitar. The band made no live appearances for all of 1996, apart from a solo performance from Ashcroft supporting Oasis in New York. [...] The rest of the year was spent playing and recording songs for a new album.|$|R
5|$|Merrick {{settled into}} {{his new life}} at the London Hospital. Treves visited him daily and <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of hours with him every Sunday. Now that Merrick had found someone who {{understood}} his speech, he was delighted to carry on long conversations with the doctor. Treves and Merrick built a friendly relationship, although Merrick never completely confided in him. He told Treves {{that he was an}} only child, and Treves had the impression that Merrick's mother, whose picture Merrick always carried with him, had abandoned him as a baby. Merrick was also reluctant to talk about his exhibition days, although he expressed gratitude towards his former managers. It did not take Treves long to realise that, contrary to his initial impressions, Merrick was not intellectually impaired.|$|E
5|$|During {{a reunion}} tour in summer 2008, The Kids in the Hall comedy troupe decided {{they would like}} to work {{together}} again. Since their 1996 movie Brain Candy, during which they had a falling out over creative differences, they had only worked together on live comedy tours and had not appeared on television together since the end of their show in 1995. Bruce McCulloch pitched a television story idea which {{the rest of the group}} liked. They <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> days together brainstorming and developing characters. The storyline resolved into a murder mystery miniseries – partly inspired by the British comedy series The League of Gentlemen. McCulloch described it as Corner Gas meets Twin Peaks. The format diverged from their typical sketch comedy style by following a continuous narrative – though side-stories explore characters further. Along with producer Susan Cavin in fall 2008, they pitched the concept to CBC executive Fred Fuchs who greenlit the project.|$|E

50|$|While {{attending}} {{high school}} in Danville, Illinois, Matt and his then-girlfriend (now wife) Darcie published a fanzine called Polyvinyl Press. In 1995, this fanzine turned into a full-fledged record label—Polyvinyl Record Co.

5000|$|The idea {{to cover}} [...] "Last Kiss" [...] came about after vocalist Eddie Vedder found an old {{record of the}} song at the Fremont Antique Mall in Seattle, Washington. He {{convinced}} {{the rest of the}} band to try out the song and it was performed a few times on the band's 1998 tour. The band eventually recorded the song at a soundcheck at the Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland on September 18, 1998, and released it as a 1998 fan club Christmas single. The band <b>spent</b> only <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of thousand dollars mixing the song. Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "It was the most minimalist recording we've ever done." ...|$|R
60|$|Men of Kirk's type are {{not given}} to deep thought. Until now he had {{probably}} never <b>spent</b> more than <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of minutes consecutively in self-examination. This vigil forced him upon himself and caused him to pass his character under review, with strange and unsatisfactory results. He had never realised before what a curiously contemptible and useless person he was. It {{seemed to him that}} this was all he was fit for--to hang about doing nothing while everybody else was busy and proving his or her own worth.|$|R

25|$|Fresh out of Cambridge, Maclean {{joined the}} Foreign Office and <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of {{years at the}} Paris embassy. He loved the pleasures {{of life in the}} French capital, but {{eventually}} longed for adventure. Against the advice of his friends (and to the delight of his London bosses), he requested a posting to Moscow, which he received right away; once there, he began to learn Russian. Travelling within the Soviet Union was frowned upon by the authorities, but Maclean managed to take several trips anyway.|$|E
25|$|Halbertsma married Johanna Iskjen Hoekema (1794–1847), a Mennonite minister's {{daughter}} from Workum, {{who came from}} a well-to-do middle-class family, on May 10, 1816. Through his wife Halbertsma attained possession of the farmstead Westerein, near Workum, {{where he and his}} family often <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of weeks in summer. Apart from those holidays, he lived out his entire life in Deventer. Halbertsma and his wife had five sons from a good marriage, which was however not without its share of problems. Of these sons Petrus, Hidde, and Tsjalling studied linguistics or medicine, while Watse en Binnert became mariners. As a father, Halbertsma experienced a large amount of grief, as his son Petrus died in 1851 in a psychiatric hospital, while Binnert passed away in 1861, and Hidde took his own life in 1865.|$|E
50|$|Born in St. Catharines, Ontario {{where he}} spent his early {{childhood}} until his family headed {{across the border to}} Niagara Falls, New York. Known to his friends as Bob Adams, the aspiring actor/radio D.J. <b>spent</b> just <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of years attending Bishop Duffy High school before dropping out and moving to New York City at the age of 17 to study acting. Upon his arrival on the west coast Adams landed a job as a page at NBC Burbank which led to a radio job in Phoenix and ultimately a twenty-five-year career in broadcasting as Bob Shannon. His on air career included radio stations in markets such as Buffalo, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Seattle, Minneapolis/St. Paul, San Diego and Los Angeles. It was while working at KFI (AM) in the mid-1970s that Adams once again turned his attention back to film acting.|$|R
500|$|A less {{positive}} {{review was}} written for The Guardian by Tom Reynolds, where he put the song at number 24 on his list [...] "Sad songs say so much". Talking about the composition {{and the meaning of}} the song, he wrote that the song was a [...] "whimpering post-breakup tune in which lead singer Amy Lee pitifully mourns the end of a relationship over a piano accompaniment that sounds like Pachelbel after the Prozac wore off", and that it [...] "closely follows the 'quantum tragedy paradigm': the shorter the time two people <b>spent</b> together as <b>a</b> <b>couple,</b> the more overwrought the song is that describes their break-up." ...|$|R
50|$|The first union {{came about}} when the last Piast king of Poland, Casimir III, {{designated}} his sororal nephew, the Angevin king Louis I of Hungary, as his heir presumptive by the Privilege of Buda. Upon the death of Casimir, who left no legitimate sons, Louis ascended the Polish throne virtually unopposed. The Polish nobility welcomed his accession, rightly believing that Louis would be an absentee king who would not take much interest in Polish affairs. He sent his mother Elizabeth, sister of Casimir III, to govern Poland as regent. Louis probably considered himself first and foremost king of Hungary; he visited his northern kingdom three times and <b>spent</b> there <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of months altogether. Negotiations with the Polish nobility frequently took place in Hungary. Hungarians themselves were unpopular in Poland, as was the king's Polish mother who governed the kingdom. In 1376, circa 160 Hungarians in her retinue were massacred in Kraków and the queen returned to Hungary disgraced. Louis replaced her with their relative, Vladislaus II of Opole.|$|R
25|$|While SuomenJoutsen {{served as}} a supply ship for the {{minesweeping}} fleet, her crew rebuilt the rigging dismantled before {{the war and the}} school ship <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of days sailing in the Baltic Sea in late 1948. Although there were plans to reactivate her as a school ship for either the Finnish Navy or the Finnish Merchant Fleet, or both, there were issues with her naval ensign — as a naval school ship she {{would not be allowed to}} carry cargo or be crewed by civilians, but a civilian flag would force her to pay expensive harbour fees. There was also no longer need for a civilian full rigged school ship. In 1949–1951, SuomenJoutsen conducted a number of short training and promotional sailings in the Baltic Sea, but never ventured further than the southern tip of Gotland.|$|E
25|$|Weill's family {{experienced}} financial hardship in {{the aftermath}} of World War I, and in July 1919, Weill abandoned his studies and returned to Dessau, where he was employed as a répétiteur at the Friedrich-Theater {{under the direction of the}} new Kapellmeister, Hans Knappertsbusch. During this time, he composed an orchestral suite in E-flat major, a symphonic poem of Rainer Maria Rilke's The Lay of the Love and Death of Cornet Christopher Rilke as well as Schilflieder, a cycle of five songs to poems by Nikolaus Lenau. In December 1919, through the help of Humperdinck, Weill was appointed as Kapellmeister at the newly founded Stadttheater in Lüdenscheid, where he directed opera, operetta, and singspiel for five months, and also composed a cello sonata and Ninon de Lenclos, a now lost one-act operatic adaptation of a play by Ernst Hardt. From May to September 1920, Weill <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of months in Leipzig, where his father had become the new director of a Jewish orphanage. Before he returned to Berlin, in September 1920, he composed Sulamith, a choral fantasy for soprano, female choir, and orchestra.|$|E
25|$|One {{theory of}} Europe's rise holds that Europe's {{geography}} {{played an important}} role in its success. The Middle East, India and China are all ringed by mountains and oceans but, once past these outer barriers, are nearly flat. By contrast, the Pyrenees, Alps, Apennines, Carpathians and other mountain ranges run through Europe, and the continent is also divided by several seas. This gave Europe some degree of protection from the peril of Central Asian invaders. Before the era of firearms, these nomads were militarily superior to the agricultural states on the periphery of the Eurasian continent and, as they broke out into the plains of northern India or the valleys of China, were all but unstoppable. These invasions were often devastating. The Golden Age of Islam was ended by the Mongol sack of Baghdad in 1258. India and China were subject to periodic invasions, and Russia <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of centuries under the Mongol-Tatar yoke. Central and western Europe, logistically more distant from the Central Asian heartland, proved less vulnerable to these threats.|$|E

25|$|Mommsen studied {{jurisprudence}} at Kiel from 1838 to 1843, {{finishing his}} studies with {{the degree of}} Doctor of Roman Law. During {{this time he was}} the roommate of Theodor Storm, who was later to become a renowned poet. Together with Mommsen's brother Tycho, the three friends even published a collection of poems (Liederbuch dreier Freunde). Thanks to a royal Danish grant, Mommsen was able to visit France and Italy to study preserved classical Roman inscriptions. During the revolution of 1848 he worked as a war correspondent in then-Danish Rendsburg, supporting the German annexation of Schleswig-Holstein and a constitutional reform. Having been forced to leave the country by the Danes, he became a professor of law in the same year at the University of Leipzig. When Mommsen protested against the new constitution of Saxony in 1851, he had to resign. However, the next year he obtained a professorship in Roman law at the University of Zurich and then <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of years in exile. In 1854 he became {{a professor of law at}} the University of Breslau where he met Jakob Bernays. Mommsen became a research professor at the Berlin Academy of Sciences in 1857.

On 20 March in Planica, Prevc achieved a [...] "perfect jump" [...] with all style referees awarding him maximum 20 points. At the same event, he also set a new hill record with 248.5 m. Prevc <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of weeks {{at the top of}} the standings during the season. At the end, he had the same number of points as Severin Freund of Germany, but the overall title went to Freund because of the higher number of victories during the season (9 for Freund and 3 for Prevc).

500|$|The large {{positive}} {{response to the}} alpha footage convinced the studio to develop Goat Simulator as a full title to Steam, putting more people on the title. The team, having no plans for a full release, debated on whether to approach a large publisher to receive funding {{to help make the}} title into something like Grand Theft Auto, but decided to stay with a small, inexpensive title that would be truer to the teaser video. Recognizing that the glitching was part of the game's appeal, Ibrisagic only sought to fix software bugs that might cause the game to crash, leaving in the other glitches and bugs associated with the physics engine as the results from these were [...] "really hilarious". They limited themselves to a short development time of four weeks without significant management oversight as to set an urgent but realistic goal to bring the game to a playable state. Ibrisagic felt it was important for the game to be supported on Steam, but initially feared that Valve Corporation would not accept the quirky title. He instead found Valve to be welcoming of the title, including a joking response from the company that stated [...] " [...] has started wearing a goat costume to work he’s so excited about this game". As part of its release, Coffee Stain added support for Steam Workshop which would let players modify the game, aware that players would likely create levels and scenarios that will glitch and crash the game for humorous results. While the physics engine allows for spectacular rendering of destruction of the game environment, which is a main feature of the game, Coffee Stain acknowledged the downside of this as [...] "it would synchronise terribly in multiplayer". They estimated that adding multiplayer would remove [...] "90 percent of the physics" [...] and many other features, and left the game as a single player title at launch. The studio considered that it only <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> months to complete the Windows version, and opted to outsource versions for OS X and Linux, with Ryan Gordon handling the porting.|$|E

Using an extended version of the Actor Partner Interdependence Model, the authors found significant negative indirect effects from mothers' chronic minor external stress via quality, but not quantity, of shared time to both parents' reported relationship satisfaction. Mothers' chronic minor external stress was associated with fewer reported quality time activities, which were also associated with lower reports of relationship satisfaction for both mothers and fathers. The authors did not find indirect effects for fathers' chronic minor external stress. Overall, the frequency of quality time activities may be more important for mothers, as it explained 25 % of variance in their relationship satisfaction, compared with 15 % in fathers' relationship satisfaction. Implications for relationship researchers and clinicians are discussed...|$|R
