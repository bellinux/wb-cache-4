5|$|In his 2005 book Active Liberty, Breyer {{made his}} first attempt to {{systematically}} lay out his views on legal theory, arguing that the judiciary <b>should</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> resolve issues {{in a manner that}} encourages popular participation in governmental decisions.|$|E
5|$|In 1837, the Maine Temperance Society split {{over whether}} they <b>should</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> ban wine {{as well as}} spirits; Dow sided with the anti-wine forces, who formed their own organization, the Maine Temperance Union. That year James Appleton, a Whig {{representative}} in the state legislature, proposed a prohibition law, and Dow spoke often and forcefully {{in favor of the}} effort, which was unsuccessful. Appleton proposed a similar law in 1838 and 1839, but despite his and Dow's best efforts, he continued to be defeated.|$|E
5|$|The third book {{continues}} along {{a similar}} vein, condemning cosmetics {{on the grounds}} that it is our souls, not our bodies, that we <b>should</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> beautify. Clement also opposes the dyeing of men's hair and male depilation as effeminacy. He advises choosing one's company carefully, to avoid being corrupted by immoral people, and while arguing that material wealth is no sin in itself, it is too likely to distract one from the infinitely more important spiritual wealth which is found in Christ. The work finishes with selections of scripture supporting Clement's argument, and following a prayer, the lyrics of a hymn.|$|E

5|$|Nixon's advisors denied he had {{abandoned}} {{a desire to}} bring the American people together. However, they were divided between those who sought national unity, and those, such as campaign manager and Attorney General John N. Mitchell, who felt Nixon should concentrate on keeping the voters who had cast their ballots for him, and <b>should</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> win over the voters who had favored third-party candidate Alabama Governor George Wallace, {{as the key to}} reelection in 1972. According to Safire, after taking office, Nixon and his advisors decided he need not bring the country together, but need only work to secure his reelection by appealing to voters who were not hostile to Nixon and his policies—they became known as the Silent Majority. Historian Stanley Kutler suggested in his book on the Nixon administration that Nixon's policies widened divisions in America, but that the nation finally came together late in his presidency—to reject Nixon and demand his removal.|$|E
5|$|When a {{vegetable}} is harvested, it {{is cut off}} from its source of water and nourishment. It continues to transpire and loses moisture as it does so, a process most noticeable in the wilting of green leafy crops. Harvesting root vegetables when they are fully mature improves their storage life, but alternatively, these root crops can {{be left in the}} ground and harvested over an extended period. The harvesting process <b>should</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> minimise damage and bruising to the crop. Onions and garlic can be dried for a few days in the field and root crops such as potatoes benefit from a short maturation period in warm, moist surroundings, during which time wounds heal and the skin thickens up and hardens. Before marketing or storage, grading {{needs to be done to}} remove damaged goods and select produce according to its quality, size, ripeness, and color.|$|E

25|$|Despite Brazil’s {{repeated}} {{claims of}} peaceful nuclear development, in 2003, Science and Technology Minister Roberto Amaral made a controversial statement. During {{an interview with}} popular Brazilian daily O Globo, Amaral stated that Brazil <b>should</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> obtain all nuclear knowledge and knowhow; when asked if his description included the knowledge to develop a nuclear bomb, he replied positively. After the statement was disseminated across national and international media, Amaral refuted it and called it a misunderstanding.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the core}} Impressionist group, Manet {{maintained}} that modern artists <b>should</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> {{exhibit at the}} Paris Salon rather than abandon it in favor of independent exhibitions. Nevertheless, when Manet was excluded from the International Exhibition of 1867, he set up his own exhibition. His mother worried that he would waste all his inheritance on this project, which was enormously expensive. While the exhibition earned poor reviews from the major critics, it also provided his first contacts with several future Impressionist painters, including Degas.|$|E

25|$|Metaphysical naturalists {{hold that}} {{reason is the}} {{refinement}} and improvement of naturally evolved faculties. The certitude of deductive logic remains unexplained by this essentially probabilistic view. Nevertheless, naturalists believe anyone who wishes to have more beliefs that are true than are false <b>should</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> perfect and consistently employ their reason in testing and forming beliefs. Empirical methods (especially those of proven use in the sciences) are unsurpassed for discovering the facts of reality, while methods of pure reason alone can securely discover logical errors.|$|E

The Physician Charter has been endorsed by more than 130 organizations, translated into 12 languages, and 100,000 copies have been distributed. In 2014 the ABIM Foundation partnered with McGraw-Hill to publish Understanding Medical Professionalism. The book was authored by medical professionalism experts Wendy S. Levinson, MD; Shiphra Ginsburg, MD; Frederic W. Hafferty, PhD; and Catherine R. Lucey, MD.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} areas of nursing practice, {{psychiatric}} mental health nursing works within nursing models, utilizing nursing care plans, and seeks {{to care for the}} whole person. However, the emphasis of mental health nursing is on the development of a therapeutic relationship or alliance. In practice, this means that the nurse <b>should</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> engage with the person in care in a positive and collaborative way that will empower the patient to draw on his or her inner resources in addition to any other treatment they may be receiving.|$|E

25|$|Alongside tragedy, European humanists also {{adapted the}} ancient comedic {{tradition}} and {{as early as}} the 15th century, Renaissance Italy had developed a form of humanist Latin comedy. Although the ancients had been less theoretical about the comedic form, the humanists used the precepts of Aelius Donatus (4th century A.D.), Horace, Aristotle and the works of Terence to elaborate a set of rules: comedy <b>should</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> correct vice by showing the truth; there should be a happy ending; comedy uses a lower style of language than tragedy; comedy does not paint the great events of states and leaders, but the private lives of people, and its principal subject is love.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} consequences of the Secular Franciscan charism is that the spiritual formation of the OFS must cater for those whose vocation is, motivated by the dynamic power of the Gospel, to live in secular circumstances. Intimate union with Christ {{lies at the heart of}} the OFS vocation. Therefore, Secular Franciscans <b>should</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> encounter the living and active person of Christ in their brothers and sisters, in Sacred Scripture, in the Church and in liturgical activity. They do this by studying, loving and most of all by living in an integrated way the human and evangelical aspects of their life.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Jannai {{taught that}} when Moses {{learned that he}} was to die on that day, he wrote 13 scrolls of the law — 12 for the 12 tribes, and one which he placed in the Ark — so that if anyone <b>should</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> forge {{anything}} in a scroll, they could refer back to the scroll in the Ark. Moses thought that he could busy himself with the Torah — the whole of which is life — and then the sun would set and the decree for his death would lapse. God signaled to the sun, but the sun refused to obey God, saying that it would not set and leave Moses alive in the world.|$|E

25|$|The {{seventh and}} last {{congress}} of the Comintern was held between July 25 and August 20, 1935. It was attended by representatives of 65 communist parties. The main report was delivered by Dimitrov, other reports were delivered by Palmiro Togliatti, Wilhelm Pieck and Dmitry Manuilsky. The congress officially endorsed the Popular Front against fascism. This policy argued that Communist Parties <b>should</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> form a Popular Front with all parties that opposed fascism and not limit themselves to forming a United Front with those parties based in the working class. There was no significant opposition to this policy within any of the national sections of the Comintern; in France and Spain in particular, it would have momentous consequences with Léon Blum's 1936 election, {{which led to the}} Popular Front government.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, this {{organization}} of power based upon personal relationships peculiar to the feudal system ensured that, {{after he became}} king of Scotland in 1124, {{the only thing that}} kept David from pursuing a policy of vigorous expansion was his friendship with Henry. To be sure, it should not be surprising to learn that David harboured territorial ambitions– such desires were cultivated by the prevailing culture of the Normans, the greatest warriors of the age, and applauded if they ended in conquest– nor should it be any surprise that he soon sought to express them upon Henry’s death. That he <b>should</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> place those ambitions upon a solid basis of propriety would have been even less remarkable, had a suitable excuse to attack not been conveniently at hand.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} {{marked the}} permanent {{end of the}} Era of Good Feelings {{and the start of}} the Second Party System. The dream of non-partisan politics, shared by Monroe, and Adams, and many earlier leaders, was shattered, replaced with Van Buren's ideal of partisan battles between legitimated political parties. The coalition of Jacksonians, Calhounites, and Crawfordites built by Jackson and Van Buren would become the Democratic Party, which dominated presidential politics in the decades prior to the Civil War. Clay's supporters would form the main opposition to Jackson as the National Republican Party. The National Republicans in turn eventually formed part of the Whig Party, which was the second major party in the United States between the 1830s and the early 1850s. Ideologically Adams had campaigned on the belief that the government <b>should</b> <b>seek</b> <b>to</b> improve the lives of citizens, while Jackson campaigned on the belief that the government should only be concerned with defending liberty against power. Though Jackson decisively won the 1828 election, this dichotomy would resonate in future presidential elections.|$|E
