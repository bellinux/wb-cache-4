25|$|On January 29, 2011, Bethany Decker (born Bethany Anne Littlejohn; May 13, 1989) {{left her}} husband's family's home in Maryland and {{returned}} to her apartment in Ashburn, Virginia. Her boyfriend, Ronald Roldan, <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> her there later that day. She has not been seen since.|$|E
25|$|Next, Satipy {{falls to}} her death in terror from the same cliff while walking with Yahmose. Was it Nofret's vengeful spirit that {{she was looking at}} over Yahmose's {{shoulder}} moments before her death? The rumours only gather pace when Yahmose and Sobek drink poisoned wine. Sobek dies, but Yahmose lingers on, having drunk less of the wine. A slave boy who <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Nofret's ghost poisoning the wine dies of poison shortly afterwards.|$|E
25|$|The {{opinion of}} the Everest {{climbing}} community began to challenge the location Odell claimed to have seen the two climbers. Many thought the Second Step, if not unclimbable, was at least not climbable in the five minutes Odell <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> {{one of the two}} surmount it. Based on their position, both Odell and Norton believed that Mallory and Irvine had made it to the summit, with Odell sharing this belief with the newspapers after the expedition. The expedition report was presented to Martin Conway, a prominent politician and mountaineer, who expressed the opinion that the summit had been reached. Conway's opinion was based on their location on the mountain and Mallory's exceptional mountaineering skill.|$|E

50|$|A day later, Awori {{refused to}} resign, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> no reason to. A day later {{a group of}} 80 MPs called for the sacking of Awori, {{threatening}} street protests if their requests were not met.|$|R
5000|$|Lin Carter ranked The Book of Ptath as van Vogt's [...] "single best novel" [...] {{and tried}} to {{convince}} him to write a sequel. R. D. Mullen, however, dismissed the novel, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> no reason to include it in an SF library.|$|R
2500|$|Graner {{appears in}} several {{pictures}} {{with his fellow}} guards Lynndie England and Sabrina Harman, giving the thumbs {{up in front of}} nude prisoners. In one photo, Graner poses over the dead body of Manadel al-Jamadi, an Iraqi prisoner; a small patch of blood can be seen on al-Jamadi's right temple and his eyes are sealed closed with tape. According to Spc. Jason Kenner's testimony, al-Jamadi was brought to the prison by Navy SEALs in good health; Kenner <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that al-Jamadi looked extensively bruised when he was brought out of the showers, dead. According to Kenner a [...] "battle" [...] took place among CIA and military interrogators over who should dispose of the body. Capt. Donald Reese, company commander of 372nd Military Police Company, gave testimony about al-Jamadi's death, saying he saw the dead prisoner. Reese testified, [...] "I was told that when he was brought in, he was combative, that they took him up to the room and during the interrogation he passed." [...] Reese stated the corpse was locked in a shower room overnight, which is where he first saw him. Reese says he was first told the man had died of a heart attack, but when he saw him he [...] "was bleeding from the head, nose, mouth". [...] The body was then autopsied, concluding that {{the cause of death was}} a blood clot from trauma.|$|E
2500|$|... "To these {{accounts}} may be added that of Nicolaus Damascenus. This writer states that at Antioch, near Daphne, {{he met with}} ambassadors from the Indians, who were sent to Augustus Caesar. It appeared from the letter that several persons were mentioned in it, but three only survived, whom he <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw.</b> The rest had died chiefly in consequence {{of the length of}} the journey. The letter was written in Greek upon a skin; the import of it was, that Porus was the writer, that although he was sovereign of six hundred kings, yet that he highly esteemed the friendship of Cæsar; {{that he was willing to}} allow him a passage through his country, in whatever part he pleased, and to assist him in any undertaking that was just. Eight naked servants, with girdles round their waists, and fragrant with perfumes, presented the gifts which were brought. The presents were a Hermes (i. e. a man) born without arms, whom I have seen, large snakes, a serpent ten cubits in length, a river tortoise of three cubits in length, and a partridge larger than a vulture. They were accompanied by the person, it is said, who burnt himself to death at Athens. This is the practice with persons in distress, who seek escape from existing calamities, and with others in prosperous circumstances, as was the case with this man. For as everything hitherto had succeeded with him, he thought it necessary to depart, lest some unexpected calamity should happen to him by continuing to live; with a smile, therefore, naked, anointed, and with the girdle round his waist, he leaped upon the pyre. On his tomb was this inscription: ...|$|E

50|$|Hollywood {{admitted}} to kidnapping Nicholas, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the boy {{walking down the}} street shortly after the windows at his home were broken out. Nicholas’ older brother, Ben Markowitz, who owed the defendant $1,200 in drug money at the time, had just claimed responsibility for breaking the windows.|$|R
50|$|As the {{two sides}} converged in the lands of Glen Fruin, the MacGregor led force was at first {{discouraged}} by the superior size of the Colquhoun led contingent. It is said a Seer encouraged the MacGregors, <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the shrouds of the dead wrapt around their opponents.|$|R

6000|$|... "Ivan," [...] said Valentin, [...] "please {{go and get}} the Commandant's sword {{from the}} library."

6000|$|... "Here is news of Link Merwell," [...] said Luke Watson, one day, as he {{came along}} with a letter. [...] "It's from {{a friend of mine}} who knows Merwell. He <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Link in Quebec, Canada, at one of the little French hotels in the lower town." ...|$|E

5000|$|In June 2017, {{he got in}} {{a dispute}} with the Danish Finance Minister Kristian Jensen at a conference on Brexit when Mr Jensen said “There {{are two kinds of}} European nations.

60|$|The old man bowed once more, a most deferential bow. Strange to <b>say,</b> when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> her, {{this claim}} of blood pleased him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] said Rupert, {{slightly}} recovering his dimples and his readiness, [...] "Johnny, yer, {{wants me}} to tell ye something. Ef he wasn't the most original self-cocking, God-forsaken liar in Injin Spring--ef he didn't lie awake in his crib mornin's to invent lies fer the day, I wouldn't mind tellin' ye, and would hev told you before. However, since you ask, and since you think you saw somebody around the school-house, Johnny yer allows that Seth Davis is spyin' round and followin' ye wherever you go, and he dragged me down yer to see it.

6000|$|... "Well, {{this is what}} Hunky Ben <b>says.</b> <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> {{your friend}} go off the other night alone to Traitor's Trap, {{following}} in the footsteps o' that notorious outlaw Buck Tom. Feelin' sure that Buck meant to waylay your friend, Hunky followed him up and overshot him to a place where he thought it likely the outlaw would lay in wait. Sure enough, when he got there he found Buck squattin' behind a big rock. So he waited to see what would turn up and be ready to rescue your friend. An' what d'ye think did turn up?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{paused and}} picked up a volume from the table. [...] "Crookes is explicit. He <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the lath move without visible cause, he saw Home thrust his hand into the hearth and stir the coals, he saw the {{accordion}} play without any reason; and in all this he is sustained by other men testing each phenomenon by means of electrical registering devices. Now we must duplicate these. We must go into court armed with photographs, records, and witnesses. We will make this a cause célèbre--doing our small part to forward this superb and fearless European movement. I intend to be both lawyer and physicist hereafter," [...] he ended, with a smile.|$|E

5000|$|During the First Chechen War, Rokhlin was {{credited}} with reorganizing the Russian forces in Chechnya and finally taking the Chechen capital of Grozny in 1995. Frustrated with the bloodshed, he left the army a few weeks later.

6000|$|Pat {{threw back}} his head and laughed heartily. [...] "Make it a dozen while you're about it, son," [...] said he. [...] "Don't be so modest. I've lived in these woods some years, but I never yet have seen a live black fox, and I've known of only two being caught. If Jim <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> one he did. There's nothing the matter with Jim's eyesight. I guess I'll have to have a look around the {{neighborhood}} where he saw it. As for our plans, Doctor, we are going to spend to-morrow with you and give these tenderfeet a few lessons on snow-shoes. We'll hit the trail for camp bright and early the next morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am willing}} to trust a man of Richet's wide {{knowledge}} and known skill in experimentation. When he <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw,</b> touched, and heard the apparition of a man, I am ready {{to believe that he}} had taken quite as many precautions as his newspaper critics would have done. He saw a helmeted soldier leave the séance cabinet and walk about. He clasped his hand, he affirmed, and found it warm and jointed (perfectly real), and he secured the breath of this phantom in a tube of baryta so unmistakably that the liquid was chemically changed in accordance with his test. There are thousands of other well-authenticated cases of materialization. I have seen scores of them myself. I am only quoting Richet because I know you believe in his methods." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} {{pointing to the}} fact that the outrageous [...] deed was perpetrated by some schoolboys who held a grudge against [...] Mr. Sparr. They are known to have been present at the blowing up [...] of the old stone bridge, and were seen near the shanty where the [...] sticks of dynamite were kept, and one boy of the town <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> [...] a young man coming from the shanty with something in his hand. Mr. [...] Sparr has the authorities at work and is piling up his evidence, [...] and the arrest of the rascally schoolboys may be hourly expected. [...] It is said that some of the boys have run away, but the [...] authorities have an idea where they can be located. The town [...] committee is thinking of offering a reward for the capture and [...] conviction of the rascals. For the safety of our citizens, the [...] Weekly Globe-Leader hopes the evil-doers will soon be [...] apprehended." ...|$|E

6000|$|SERGIUS (coming {{clear of}} the table and drawing her with him). I am {{surprised}} at myself, Louka. What would Sergius, the hero of Slivnitza, <b>say</b> if <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> me now?

What would the half dozen Sergiuses who keep popping in and out of this handsome figure of mine say if they caught us here? (Letting go her hand and slipping his arm dexterously round her waist.) Do you consider my figure handsome, Louka? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, and {{not less}} in my shop," [...] said Nello, {{leading the way}} into the inner room, in which were some benches, a table, with one book in {{manuscript}} and one printed in capitals lying open upon it, a lute, a few oil-sketches, and a model or two of hands and ancient masks. [...] "For my shop is a no less fitting haunt of the Muses, as you will acknowledge when you feel the sudden illumination of understanding and the serene vigour of inspiration that will come to you with a clear chin. Ah! you can make that lute discourse, I perceive. I, too, have some skill that way, though the serenata is useless when daylight discloses a visage like mine, looking no fresher than an apple that has stood the winter. But look at that sketch: it is a fancy of Piero di Cosimo's, a strange freakish painter, who <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> it by long looking at a mouldy wall." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{with the}} best wishes, it is {{impossible}} for the present writer to join either the [...] "Plate Club" [...] or the [...] "Uniform Club" [...] (as these reunions are designated); for one could not shake hands with a friend who was standing behind your chair, or nod a How-d'ye-do? to the butler who was pouring you out a glass of wine;--so that what I know about the gents in our neighborhood is from mere casual observation. For instance, I have a slight acquaintance with (1) Thomas Spavin, who commonly wears an air of injured innocence, and is groom to Mr. Joseph Green, of Our Street. [...] "I tell why the brougham 'oss is out of condition, and why Desperation broke out all in a lather! 'Osses will, this 'eavy weather; and Desperation was always the most mystest hoss I ever see.--I take him out with Mr. Anderson's 'ounds--I'm above it.

6000|$|... "But now {{see what}} a good bruddykins I am. I have seen a fight, a real {{exciting}} fight, and I have kept it to the last to tell you about.... It was a fight in the air. And the British won. It began with a German machine appearing, very minute and high, sailing towards our lines {{a long way to}} the left. We could tell it was a German because of the black cross; they decorate every aeroplane with a black Iron Cross on its wings and tail; that our officer could see with his glasses. (He let me look.) Suddenly whack, whack, whack, came a line of little puffs of smoke behind it, and then one in front of it, which meant that our anti-aircraft guns were having a go at it. Then, as suddenly, Archibald stopped, and we could see the British machine buzzing across the path of the German. It was just like two birds circling in the air. Or wasps. They buzzed like wasps. There was a little crackling--like brushing your hair in frosty weather. They were shooting at each other. Then our lieutenant called out, 'Hit, by Jove!' and handed the glasses to Park and instantly wanted them back. He <b>says</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> bits of the machine flying off.|$|E
