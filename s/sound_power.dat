5|$|Once {{he moved}} to Nutting, Bushnell took over the {{majority}} of the engineering work for the game; Dabney has stated that he advised Bushnell on some of the design, and that some of the construction was done by Steve Bristow, an intern at Ampex. There is disagreement in interviews with Bushnell and Dabney as to how much work Dabney did on the final cabinet, with Dabney claiming credit for the controls, <b>sound,</b> <b>power</b> supply, initial wooden cabinet, and invention of the hyperspace color inversion, while Bushnell claims credit for everything but the sound, cabinet, power supply, and monitor. By August 1971, an initial prototype of the game—now named Computer Space to be similar to Computer Quiz—was complete, and Syzygy moved on to location testing. They installed the game at the Dutch Goose bar near Stanford University, where it met with great success. Nutting was heartened by the response and rushed to make several finished cabinets for the Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition in October. Further location tests found a less enthusiastic response from customers confused by the game mechanics and controls, and Syzygy hurriedly tried to adjust the game to be more understandable to players.|$|E
25|$|The {{researchers}} deduced {{that the}} fluctuating force was proportional to U2, but the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> {{was found to}} vary from U4.5 to U6.0. If the measurement bandwidth is broad and the measurement distance {{is out of the}} near field, there are two dynamic factors (Strouhal number and dimensionless force), that can cause the exponent to be less than six. Both the Deltameter and hole tone data show the Strouhal number is a weak negative function of Reynolds number, which is squared in the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> equation. This would result in a reduced speed exponent. This factor is not likely to explain the large reduction in exponent however.|$|E

On an airfoil {{there would be a}} correlation length less than the wingspan resulting in a number independent dipoles arrayed laterally. The <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> would be diminished somewhat. Since the dipole model is based on the time rate of change of the force, reduction of <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> might be accomplished by reducing that rate. One possible means would be for the opposite sides of the surface to gradually sense each other spatially prior to the trailing edge and thus reduce the rate at the edge. This might be done by a section of graduated porous or flexible materials.|$|E

Atelectasis is a respiratory collapse defined as the lack of gas exchange within alveoli, and due to airway obstruction, or compression of the lung. This atelectasis condition is conventionally founded as the asymmetric sounds of the left lung area and right one by auscultation using air-conducted stethoscope. We aimed to this auscultation diagnose objectively.

25|$|Manipulation of the {{equation}} yields the lower two equations for the dipole <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> of both lift and drag.

The data fit was quite good, confirming dynamic similarity and the dipole model. The slight discrepancy in level and frequency overlap suggests that both the dimensionless force and the Strouhal number had weak dependence on the Reynolds number.|$|E

For detailed study of the whistle, see Matveev. Since the first mode resonance is about half-wave, the sound field emitted from the tube is from two in-phase monopole-like sources, one at either end. A gas flame inside a tube can drive resonance; it was called a singing flame. There is a reverse Rijke Tube when hot air passes through a cold grid.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{location}} of point excitation force {{is an important}} factor to influence sound radiation of underwater structure. A vibroacoustic model of a simply supported rectangular plate covered by decoupling coating is presented. The influences of the locations and the number of point excitation force to <b>sound</b> radiation <b>power</b> insertion loss are analyzed. The results show that: 1) The {{location of}} point excitation force has much influence to <b>sound</b> radiation <b>power</b> insertion loss; 2) The average <b>sound</b> radiation <b>power</b> insertion loss is closer to convergence as the number of point excitation force becomes larger; 3) When The location of point excitation force is closer to the corner of plate, <b>sound</b> radiation <b>power</b> insertion loss compares well with that of multi-point average. When plate model is used to measure the performance of noise reduction of decoupling coating, the location of point excitation force should be located of the position from a corner of the tested plate so that as many plate modes as possible are excited.

25|$|Loudspeaker {{efficiency}} {{is defined as}} the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> output divided by the electrical power input. Most loudspeakers are inefficient transducers; only about 1% of the electrical energy sent by an amplifier to a typical home loudspeaker is converted to acoustic energy. The remainder is converted to heat, mostly in the voice coil and magnet assembly. The main reason for this is the difficulty of achieving proper impedance matching between the acoustic impedance of the drive unit and the air it radiates into. (At low frequencies, improving this match is the main purpose of speaker enclosure designs). The efficiency of loudspeaker drivers varies with frequency as well. For instance, the output of a woofer driver decreases as the input frequency decreases because of the increasingly poor match between air and the driver.|$|E
25|$|The main {{advantage}} of horn loudspeakers {{is they are}} more efficient; they can typically produce 10 times (10 dB) more <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> than a cone speaker from a given amplifier output. Therefore horns are widely used in public address systems, megaphones, and sound systems for large venues like theaters, auditoriums, and sports stadiums. Their disadvantage is that their frequency response is more uneven because of resonance peaks, and horns have a cutoff frequency below which their response drops off. To achieve adequate response at bass frequencies horn speakers must be very large and cumbersome, so they are more often used for midrange and high frequencies. The first practical loudspeakers, introduced {{around the turn of}} the 20th century, were horn speakers. Due to the development in recent decades of cone loudspeakers which have a flatter frequency response, and the availability of inexpensive amplifier power, the use of horn speakers in high fidelity audio systems over the last decades has declined.|$|E
25|$|A driver with {{a higher}} maximum power rating cannot {{necessarily}} be driven to louder levels than a lower-rated one, since sensitivity and power handling are largely independent properties. In the examples that follow, assume (for simplicity) that the drivers being compared have the same electrical impedance, are operated at the same frequency within both driver's respective pass bands, and that power compression and distortion are low. For the first example, a speaker 3dB more sensitive than another produces double the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> (is 3dB louder) for the same power input. Thus, a 100W driver ("A") rated at 92dB for 1W @ 1m sensitivity puts out twice as much acoustic power as a 200W driver ("B") rated at 89dB for 1W @ 1m when both are driven with 100W of input power. In this particular example, when driven at 100W, speaker A produces the same SPL, or loudness as speaker B would produce with 200W input. Thus, a 3dB increase in sensitivity of the speaker means that it needs half the amplifier power to achieve a given SPL. This translates into a smaller, less complex power amplifier—and often, to reduced overall system cost.|$|E

25|$|As {{a crystal}} radio has no power supply, the <b>sound</b> <b>power</b> {{produced}} by the earphone comes solely from the transmitter of the radio station being received, via the radio waves captured by the antenna. The power available to a receiving antenna decreases with the square of its distance from the radio transmitter. Even for a powerful commercial broadcasting station, if {{it is more than}} {{a few miles from the}} receiver the power received by the antenna is very small, typically measured in microwatts or nanowatts. In modern crystal sets, signals as weak as 50 picowatts at the antenna can be heard. Crystal radios can receive such weak signals without using amplification only due to the great sensitivity of human hearing, which can detect sounds with an intensity of only 10−16 W/cm2. Therefore, crystal receivers have to be designed to convert the energy from the radio waves into sound waves as efficiently as possible. Even so, they are usually only able to receive stations within distances of about 25 miles for AM broadcast stations, although the radiotelegraphy signals used during the wireless telegraphy era could be received at hundreds of miles, and crystal receivers were even used for transoceanic communication during that period.|$|E
