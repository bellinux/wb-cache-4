40|$|Two {{levels of}} seed rates and three forward speeds were applied in a {{randomized}} complete block design experiment using a mechanical sugar cane planter. The effects of three speeds and two seed {{rates on the}} eye damage percent, <b>stalk</b> <b>cutting</b> percent and uniformity of set placement were studied. Manually cultivated plots were used as control plots. Results showed that increasing forward speed up to 6 km/h gave {{a significant increase in}} the eye damage percent and <b>stalk</b> <b>cutting</b> percent for both seed rates used. The various speeds used were found to influence the number of stalks dropped per row and consequently the cane yield. Mechanically planted cane was found to produce more tillers per stool than hand planting due to the higher application rates. No significant differences in yield were found between machine and hand planting when a seed rate of 2. 0 m cane/m land was used...|$|E
40|$|The {{southern}} root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita) {{is a major}} parasite {{of cotton}} in the U. S., and management tactics for this nematode attempt to minimize population levels. We compared three post-harvest practices {{for their ability to}} reduce nematode population levels in the field, thereby reducing initial nematode population for the next year's crop. The three practices tested were: 1) chemical defoliation before harvest plus cutting cotton stalks after harvest, 2) chemical defoliation plus applying a herbicide to kill plants prior to cutting the stalks, and 3) chemical defoliation without cutting stalks. Experiments were conducted in both the greenhouse and in the field. The greenhouse experiments demonstrated that M. incognita reproduction (measured as egg counts and root gall rating indices) was significantly greater when stalks were not cut. Cutting stalks plus applying herbicide to kill cotton roots did not significantly reduce nematode reproduction compared to cutting stalks alone. In field experiments, cutting stalks reduced egg populations and root galling compared to defoliation without <b>stalk</b> <b>cutting.</b> In a greenhouse bioassay which used soil from the field plots, plants grown in soil from the defoliation only treatment had greater root gall ratings and egg counts than in the <b>stalk</b> <b>cutting</b> plus herbicide treatment. Therefore, we conclude that cutting cotton stalks immediately after harvest effectively reduces M. incognita reproduction, and may lead to a lower initial population density of this nematode in the following year...|$|E
40|$|Sweet Sorghum {{is similar}} to racemose maize with about 3 m height and 0. 5 - 3 cm {{thickness}} of stalk. Sweet Sorghum has sweet flavor stalk, which is used for sugar production. Developed cutting mechanism in this research has a rotary disk with 50 cm diameter and four cutting blades that spin clockwise. The stalks are cut with the impact and inertia forces at the linear velocity of 27 m/s, by cutting blades. This system has a simple bar mechanism guiding the whole-stalk to one side. The cutting quality tests were achieved by two series of blades with 30 °and 45 ° blade angles on the stalk.

40|$|Summary. Buckwheat is {{a species}} prone to lodging {{which is one}} of the reasons of {{lowering}} the size of buckwheat seeds yield; the other is never-ending vegetation, which favours uneven seeds maturation and seeds shattering before harvesting. At one-stage harvesting, canopy des-sication of the presently cultivated buckwheat varieties is necessary. Determinate form is characterised by a shorter vegetation period than other cultivated varieties, it loses leaves and dries earlier. Height, diameter, stiffness and energy of <b>cutting</b> <b>stalks</b> of Determinate from was assessed. It was found that the higher is an internode of a stalk the lower is its stiffness. The height of a stalk and its thickness are features which are positively correlated with stiffness and energy of <b>cutting</b> <b>stalks.</b> Energy necessary for <b>cutting</b> <b>stalks</b> decreases along with the plant height and is rather low.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The Noble Dendrobium orchid (Dendrobium nobile Lindl.) is an {{ornamental}} species usually propagated by leaf axillary shoots called “Keikes”, but cutting {{is possible}} although, {{many do not}} produce leaves or roots and eventually rot. To increase the proportion of successful <b>stalk</b> <b>cuttings,</b> two substrates were evaluated {{in the present study}} (gravel and a 1 : 1 tree-fern shredded trunk:palm seed mixture) in interaction with the application of nitrogen fertilizer (urea 2 g L- 1) and a commercial leaf fertilizer made from kelp seaweed (“Kelpak” a 2 mL L- 1). Only water was applied for the control treatment. The evaluated parameters included the proportion of successful cuttings, vigor, the proportion of rotten stalks, the number of roots/plant and root length/per plant. The gravel was found to be the best substrate for the rooting and/or shoot production (37. 2 % in average) of the cuttings. The application of urea or Kelpak induced vigor in the obtained plantlets, but the dosage required for a greater efficiency was not reached. The cuttings layered on gravel plus the application of urea at a concentration of 2 g L- 1 was the most effective treatment, with 40. 7 % successful cuttings...|$|R
40|$|A field {{experiment}} was conducted during 2003 / 2004 {{to determine the}} effect of different cane portions/cuttings on per cent sprouting, subsequent growth and cane yield of sugarcane variety N- 14. The trial was executed on a sandy soil at Wonji-Shoa Sugarcane Plantation. The experiment was laid in randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replications and five treatments comprising setts from top, middle, bottom; mixture of top+middle, and mixture of top+middle+ bottom stalk portions. The results of the experiment showed that cuttings taken from the middle and top portion of the stalk showed better results in sprouting and improved sprouting by 54. 75 and 54. 30 %, respectively, over those taken from the bottom portion. Similarly, setts (cutting) taken from the mixtures of top and middle; top, middle and bottom portion of <b>stalks</b> <b>cutting</b> improved sett emergence by 45. 5 and 47. 5 %, respectively, as compared to cutting taken from bottom portion. Besides, statistical analysis showed highly significant differences (P< 0. 01) in sprouting of different stalk portions from the bottom portion, i. e. treatments (T 1, T 2, T 4 and T 5) significantly increased sprouting percentage over the bottom stalk portion. On the other hand, no significant effects of different stalk portions were observed on plant population, plant height, cane yield and its components at harvest. Cane growers are also advised to use the middle and top portions of cane plant as planting material for commercial sugar production. However, further studies are necessary considering a range of commercial sugarcane varieties and soil type in all sugar plantations in Ethiopia to come up with clear-cut recommendations.

40|$|Bacterial wilt (Ralstoniasolanacearum) is an {{extremely}} damaging disease of flue-cured tobacco in the southeastern USA. It is generally believed that R. solanacearum infects field-grown tobacco through the roots. Epidemics of bacterial wilt are so common within South Carolina that the organism must be spread in a more rapid and efficient manner than the movement of soil on equipment. Field trials conducted at the Pee Dee Research and Education Center measured the spread of R. solancearum down a row of tobacco from a point inoculation following machine flower removal (topping), leaf harvest or <b>stalk</b> <b>cutting.</b> Machine topping, leaf harvest and <b>stalk</b> <b>cutting</b> increased disease 879 %, 1245 %, and 800 % respectively within a 20 plant row when compared to hand topping, hand harvesting or a non contaminated stalk cutter (cv. K 326, P ≤ 0. 001). A survey was conducted to determine if R. solanacearum is a common contaminate on harvesting equipment in South Carolina. Tobacco harvesting equipment was randomly selected within Horry and Marion counties and sampled for R. solanacearum by streaking sterile cotton swabs on the harvester surface, then re-streaking the swab onto an enriched Tetrazolium-based selective media (SM 3). R. solanacearum-like colonies that developed on SM 3 were inoculated onto cv. Rutgers tomato to confirm pathogenicity. Bacteria from diseased plants were reisolated on SM 3 and R. solanacearum identity confirmed with an immuno strip test. Pathogenic populations of R. solanacearum were recovered from steel defoliator knives, rubber defoliators and steel guides (51, 50 and 50 % of sampled harvesters respectively). The survival of R. solanacearum on mechanical steel topper blades was determined by running the topper through infected tobacco plants and sequentially sampling the steel knives over time for viable populations of R. solanacearum. Sterile cotton swabs were swept across the blade surface, then streaked onto SM 3 media. Confirmed pathogenic populations of R. solanacearum could be recovered on SM 3 media for up to 6 h after topping R. solanacearum-infected tobacco. The efficiency of machine transmission of R. solanacearum and it's longevity on tobacco machinery {{may be responsible for}} the high frequency of bacterial wilt epidemics in flue-cured tobacco occurring in the Southeastern USA and its movement into previously clean fields...|$|E
40|$|Existing corn {{harvester}} cutting blades have {{problems associated with}} large cutting resistance, high energy consumption, and poor cut quality. Using bionics principles, a bionic blade was designed by extracting the cutting tooth profile curve of the B. horsfieldi palate. Using a double-blade cutting device testing system, a single <b>stalk</b> <b>cutting</b> performance contrast test for corn stalks obtained at harvest time was carried out. Results show that bionic blades have superior performance, demonstrated by strong cutting ability and good cut quality. Using statistical analysis of two groups of cutting test data, the average cutting force and cutting energy of bionic blades and ordinary blades were obtained as 480. 24 [*]N and 551. 31 [*]N and 3. 91 [*]J and 4. 38 [*]J, respectively. Average maximum cutting force and cutting energy consumption for the bionic blade were reduced by 12. 89 % and 10. 73 %, respectively. Variance analysis showed that both blade types {{had a significant effect}} on maximum cutting energy and cutting energy required to cut a corn stalk. This demonstrates that bionic blades have better cutting force and energy consumption reduction performance than ordinary blades...|$|E
40|$|Propagation {{of noble}} dendrobium orchid (Dendrobium nobile Lindl.) by cutting was studied in two {{experiment}}s. In the first experiment we evaluated the effect stem age on propagation success: mature stems - from already bloomed stems; and young stems – yet to bloom; and Nitrogen fertilizer application, from two sources: as Nitrate and Ammonium (respectively as Calcium Nitrate at concentrations of: 5. 81 gL- 1; 11. 61 gL- 1; 17. 42 gL- 1; and Urea at concentrations of 2. 00 gL- 1; 4. 00 gL- 1 and 6. 00 gL- 1 plus control treatments). We evaluated the following parameters: {{the number of}} <b>cuttings</b> <b>stalks</b> that launched shoots and/or roots, vigor, number of roots per plant and root length per plant. Factorial analysis of variance (stems age x source of Nitrogen; and age of stem x Nitrogen level) was applied using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) approach. Where significant differences were observed, averages were compared using post-hoc tests (Tukey). Propagation success was higher using cuttings from mature stems (60. 2 %), a value 1. 6 times higher than obtained with stem cuttings from young stems (38. 0 %). Application of Nitrogen, in both forms, did not influence any of the evaluated parameters. In the second experiment we treated cuttings from mature stems with Salicylic acid in 3 concentrations (0. 10 mM; 0. 50 mM; 1. 00 mM and plus a control treatment). Evaluated parameters included proportion of <b>cuttings</b> <b>stalks</b> that launched shoots and/or roots, leaf length, root length, and number of roots per stem cutting.

40|$|Background: In Africa and Asia, {{sugarcane}} is {{the host}} of at least seven different virus species in the genus Mastrevirus of the family Geminiviridae. However, with the exception of Sugarcane white streak virus in Barbados, no other sugarcane-infecting mastrevirus has been reported in the New World. Conservation and exchange of sugarcane germplasm using <b>stalk</b> <b>cuttings</b> facilitates the spread of sugarcane-infecting viruses. Methods: A virion-associated nucleic acids (VANA) -based metagenomics approach was used to detect mastrevirus sequences in 717 sugarcane samples from Florida (USA), Guadeloupe (French West Indies), and Réunion (Mascarene Islands). Contig assembly was performed using CAP 3 and sequence searches using BLASTn and BLASTx. Mastrevirus full genomes were enriched from total DNA by rolling circle amplification, cloned and sequenced. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities were determined using SDT v 1. 2. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using MEGA 6 and PHYML 3. Results: We identified a new sugarcane-infecting mastrevirus in six plants sampled from germplasm collections in Florida and Guadeloupe. Full genome sequences were determined and analyzed for three virus isolates from Florida, and three from Guadeloupe. These six genomes share > 88 % genome-wide pairwise identity with one another and between 89 and 97 % identity with a recently identified mastrevirus (KR 150789) from a sugarcane plant sampled in China. Sequences similar to these were also identified in sugarcane plants in Réunion. Conclusions: As these virus isolates share < 64 % genome-wide identity with all other known mastreviruses, we propose classifying them within a new mastrevirus species named Sugarcane striate virus. This is the first report of sugarcane striate virus (SCStV) in the Western Hemisphere, a virus that most likely originated in Asia. The distribution, vector, and impact of SCStV on sugarcane production remains to be determined. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The EU Common {{agricultural}} policy stimulates farmers {{to grow more}} energy crops, including short rotation coppice and other perennial crops. There are other resources of bioenergy as agricultural residue and peat. Peat {{can be used as}} an additive for manufacturing of solid biofuel, because it improves the density, durability of stalk material briquettes (pellets) and avoids corrosion of boilers. Naturally herbaceous biomass is a material of low density (20 - 60 kg m- 3) and not favorable for transportation on long distances. Baling can increase the bulk density to 100 - 200 kg m- 3. The main conditioning operation before biomass compacting is shredding. The shredder cutterbar has to be designed with friction energy losses decreased to minimum. According to this mainly <b>stalk</b> material <b>cutting</b> properties have to be investigated. Experimental investigation of common reed stalk conditioning properties as different cutting methods can characterize maximum of energy consumption in these operations for all groups of stalk materials in Latvia, because reeds have higher tensile strength (~ 200 N mm- 2) and accordingly other strength parameters...|$|R

The main {{purpose of this study}} is to produce a dynamometer with type four square <b>stalks</b> for <b>cutting</b> force measurement, dynamometer designed to be able tomeasure the axial force and tangential force. The design process consists of designing, manufacturing and calibration processes. The design step is started from material selection, dynamometer selection and dynamometer dimensional design.

Afterthat, the dynamometer is assembled for calibration process. The calibration process consists of hysteresis and repeatability errors. This research revealed the hysteresis for maximum tangential force of 1 milivolt and for maximum axial force of 2 milivolt. The repeatability error was 2 milivolt for the maximum tangential force and maximum axial force of 2 milivolt.

40|$|AbstractTest {{plots of}} sorghum were planted and cut at maturity. Natural drying {{of the cut}} {{material}} was monitored in the field. Laboratory drying tests were conducted to determine the drying kinetics of the stalks under four different configurations at 50 °C and 0. 5 m/s air velocity. These included: 20 cm long sections with sealed ends to duplicate stalks of infinite length and remove “end effects”; 20 cm long sections with open ends to account for “end effects”; and 20 cm sections with longitudinal splitting to remove {{the effects of the}} outer layer of the stalks. In addition, short sections (5 cm) were dried to determine the impact of enhanced “end effects” on drying. Mathematical models were derived from replicate laboratory trials and were used to predict the times required to reach a final moisture content of 10 % (wet basis). These times ranged from over 200 hours with the sealed ends to 15 hours with splitting of the stalks to expose the interior fully to the drying medium. Field drying of cut sorghum was found to be insufficient to adequately dry these materials for storage or use in energy production, especially under wet-weather conditions. Laboratory tests showed the need for substantial disruption of the stalk surface to promote drying. This can be achieved through mechanical maceration of the <b>stalks.</b> Simply <b>cutting</b> the <b>stalks</b> at ground level and relying upon open-air drying did not reduce the moisture content to acceptable levels for animal feed or energy production...|$|R
50|$|Bamboo {{can be cut}} and {{laminated}} into {{sheets and}} planks. This process involves <b>cutting</b> <b>stalks</b> into thin strips, planing them flat, and boiling and drying the strips; they are then glued, pressed and finished. Long used in China and Japan, entrepreneurs started developing and selling laminated bamboo flooring in the West during the mid-1990s; products made from bamboo laminate, including flooring, cabinetry, furniture and even decorations, are currently surging in popularity, transitioning from the boutique market to mainstream providers such as Home Depot. The bamboo goods industry (which also includes small goods, fabric, etc.) {{is expected to be}} worth $25 billion by 2012. The quality of bamboo laminate varies among manufacturers and varies according to the maturity of the plant from which it was harvested (six years being considered the optimum); the sturdiest products fulfill their claims of being up to three times harder than oak hardwood while others may be softer than standard hardwood.|$|R
50|$|Commercial {{sugarcane}} is planted from <b>stalk</b> <b>cuttings</b> {{and placed}} in furrows about five feet apart. After approximately 12 months, the mature sugarcane is ready for harvest. Growers average four harvests each season from a single planting. Harvesting season lasts from late October through mid-March, approximately 150 days.The {{first step in the}} harvesting process is the highly controlled pre-harvest burning of the cane fields. Each field burn is individually permitted by the State of Florida Division of Forestry. Farmers are allowed to burn only when climatic conditions permit. Burning causes excessive leaves to be removed, preparing the way for the mechanical harvesters and then the processing of the cane. An added benefit to this practice is that it reduces the need for applications of pesticides.The Cooperative harvests an average of 500 acres per day using combine-style mechanical harvesters. In a typical harvesting unit, three or four harvesters operate in tandem with six to eight tractors and strings of wagons. The harvesters contain rotating knives, which cut through the sugarcane {{at the base of the}} stalk. The cane tops are also cut off by rotating knives and excess foliage is removed by giant extraction fans.As the sugarcane passes through the harvester, it is cut into 12-inch lengths and put into field wagons. The sugarcane is then hauled to a nearby transfer station and loaded onto semi-trailers for delivery to Glades Sugar House for grinding.Each semi contains about 19-tons of sugarcane. A load arrives at the mill site about every 45 seconds during daylight hours. Approximately 1,200 loads are delivered daily to keep the processing facility at peak capacity during harvest season.More than 61,000 acres are harvested each season, producing more than 2.4 million tons of sugarcane.ProcessingThe Glades Sugar House operates 24-hours a day throughout the 150-day annual harvest. The mill grinds as much as 26,000 tons of sugarcane per day or three million tons each season. One ton of sugarcane produces approximately 220 pounds of raw sugar. Experienced operators use technology-based equipment to separate the harvested raw cane into sugar, water, molasses and bagasse (the pulp, rind and fiber of the sugarcane stalk). Every part of the sugarcane stalk is used.Within 24 hours of harvesting, each load of sugarcane is cut and processed into raw sugar. Along the way the high-tech mill uses all of the plant’s by-products. Even the fibrous wood pulp that remains after the sugar cane has been repeatedly pressed, crushed and shredded is not wasted. This pulp, called bagasse, fuels the mill’s boilers, creating steam-generated electricity to power the mill. By using bagasse as a fuel, the Cooperative saves the equivalent of 31 million gallons of fossil fuel each year. The water that makes up 80 percent of the cane stalk is also recycled and re-used within the process. Combined, all of the state’s sugar producers save 113 million gallons of fuel oil or 2.1 billion kilowatt hours of electricity each year. Processing involves separating the natural sugar juice from the stalk then concentrating the juice to produce raw sugar crystals and blackstrap molasses, which is sold primarily as animal feed. During the 2010-11 harvest season, the Cooperative produced more than 260,000 tons of raw sugar and 16 million gallons of black strap molasses.|$|R
