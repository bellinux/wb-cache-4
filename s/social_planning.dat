25|$|King had {{a long-standing}} concern with city {{planning}} {{and the development}} of the national capital, since he had been trained in the settlement house movement and envisioned town planning and garden cities as a component of his broader program of social reform. He drew on four broad traditions in early North American planning: <b>social</b> <b>planning,</b> the Parks Movement, the City Scientific, and the City Beautiful. King's greatest impact was as the political champion for the planning and development of Ottawa, Canada's national capital. His plans, much of which were completed in the two decades after his death, was part of a century of federal planning that repositioned Ottawa as a national space in the City Beautiful style. Confederation Square, for example, was initially planned to be a civic plaza to balance the nearby federal presence of Parliament Hill. The Great War monument was not installed until the 1939 royal visit, and King intended that the replanning of the capital would be the World War II memorial. However, the symbolic meaning of the World War II monument gradually expanded to become the place of remembrance for all Canadian war sacrifices.|$|E

40|$|M. Phil. The <b>Social</b> <b>Plan</b> is an {{alternative}} retrenchment process to section 189 of the Labour Relations Act No. 66 of 1995 as amended. When the now defunct Mpumalanga Development Corporation was dismantled in 1997, following the speech of the then Premier of the Province, of the 5 th December 1996, South Africa saw the <b>Social</b> <b>Plan</b> route being followed {{for the first time}} in its short democratic history. While the <b>Social</b> <b>plan</b> is the better of the two routes, it still looks good on paper, but has been let down by the trade unions, the employers, the development corporations and the individual beneficiaries themselves in this case. The sad part of this is that the Government departments and the development corporations are the custodians of the objectives sought and enshrined in the <b>Social</b> <b>plan.</b> Their failure to observe this fact and live up to the expectations it genders is itself an indictment on these stakeholders. The dissertation deals with the deeper analysis and findings of the events and the omissions that took place in pursuit of the implementation of this novel concept in a real life situation. Definite recommendations are made within the text that contributes to how the effort can be rescued for the benefit of the retrenchees and the economy as a whole. The approach in this work has taken the form of a literature review as well as a field survey. The field survey did not yield a very high sample, but 20 respondents, who are former employees who were retrenched following the <b>Social</b> <b>Plan</b> route, were interviewed. These respondents had been located in the former KwaNdebele and former KaNgwane regions of the Mpumalanga Province. The main problem that resulted in this research was that the country as a whole is suffering a very high rate of unemployed at 37. 5 % (according to the 2001 Census Report) in the Mpumalanga Province. While that needs some attention, there is an increase in the retrenchments coming as a result of various global and domestic factors. These collectively impact the employment situation more adversely than positively. The <b>social</b> <b>plan</b> being one tool chosen to alleviate the problems identified in its own self contained rationale for being, has failed to live up to the expectations of all the stakeholders affected by it. The experience of the stakeholders in the first attempt to implement the <b>social</b> <b>plan,</b> have defeated the very objectives of the <b>social</b> <b>plan,</b> which include, inter alia, the following: a [...] . to avoid job losses and employment decline wherever possible. In cases where large job losses are unavoidable, it would seek to actively manage retrenchments and ameliorate their effects on individuals and local economies". The findings in this study revealed that the <b>social</b> <b>plan</b> rather deepened the problem and exacerbated rather than alleviated it. This adversity is not due to the nature of the <b>social</b> <b>plan</b> as an approach and a route to meeting the aims of its creation. It is rather reflective of the way and attitude with which parties to the <b>social</b> <b>plan</b> failed to apply their best abilities and efforts in its application. The dissertation also touches on entrepreneurships, Post employment and the currently raging broad based black economic empowerment drive that has taken the country by storm in various sectors. The attempt by this drive is to address the possible acceleration of the integration of black people into business at all levels and not just at SMMEs or post employment. One could say the whole BBBEE drive seeks to address even the pre-employment era in the life of a black South African...|$|R

In December that same year, bread prices were fixed, 55,000 volunteers were sent to the south of the country to teach writing and reading skills and provide medical attention to a sector of the population that had previously been ignored, a central commission was established to oversee a tri-partite payment plan in which equal place was given to government, employees and employers, and a protocol agreement was signed with the United Centre of Workers which granted workers representational rights on the funding board of the <b>Social</b> <b>Planning</b> Ministry. An obligatory minimum wage for workers of all ages (including apprentices) was established, free milk was introduced for expectant and nursing mothers and for [...] {{children between the ages of}} 7 and 14, free school meals were established, rent reductions were carried out, and the construction of the Santiago subway was rescheduled so as to serve working-class neighbourhoods first. Workers benefited from increases in social security payments, an expanded public works program, and a modification of the wage and salary adjustment mechanism (which had originally been introduced in the Forties to cope with the country’s permanent inflation), while middle-class Chileans benefited from the elimination of taxes on modest incomes and property. In addition, state-sponsored programs distributed free food to the country’s neediest citizens, and in the countryside, peasant councils were established to mobilise agrarian workers and small proprietors. In the government’s first budget (presented to the Chilean congress in November 1970), the minimum taxable income level was raised, removing from the tax pool 35% of those who had paid taxes on earnings in the previous year. In addition, the exemption from general taxation was raised to a level equivalent to twice the minimum wage. Exemptions from capital taxes were also extended, which benefitted 330,000 small proprietors. The extra increases that Frei promised to the armed forces were also fully paid. According to one estimate, purchasing power went up by 28% between October 1970 and July 1971.|$|E

The Local Government (General) Amendment (Community and <b>Social</b> <b>Plans)</b> Regulation 1998 grew out of the 1996 NSW Social Justice Directions Statement “Fair Go, Fair Share, Fair Say” which committed the Department of Local Government to ensuring government services are responsive to community needs and diversity.
