5|$|H.D. {{was born}} into the Moravian {{community}} in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Her father, Charles Doolittle, was professor of astronomy at Lehigh University and her mother, Helen (Wolle), was a Moravian with {{a strong interest in}} music. H.D. was their only surviving daughter in a family of five sons. In 1896, Charles Doolittle was appointed Flower Professor of Astronomy at the University of Pennsylvania, and the family moved to a house in Upper Darby. She attended Philadelphia's Friends' Central High School, at Fifteenth and Race streets, graduating in 1905. In 1901, she met and befriended Ezra Pound, who was {{to play a major role}} both in her private life and her emergence as a writer. In 1905, Pound presented her with a <b>sheaf</b> <b>of</b> love poems under the collective title Hilda's Book.|$|E
5|$|Kubera {{is often}} {{depicted}} as a dwarf, with complexion of lotus leaves and a big belly. He is described as having three legs, only eight teeth, one eye, and being adorned with jewels. He is sometimes depicted riding a man. The description of deformities like the broken teeth, three legs, three heads and four arms appear only in the later Puranic texts. Kubera holds a mace, a pomegranate or a money bag in his hand. He may also carry a <b>sheaf</b> <b>of</b> jewels or a mongoose with him. In Tibet, the mongoose is considered a symbol of Kubera's victory over Nāgas—the guardians of treasures. Kubera is usually depicted with a mongoose in Buddhist iconography.|$|E
5|$|The Abbey Shield was {{designed}} by Pierre de Chaignon la Rose of Harvard University. It incorporates the personal coat of Saint Anselm of Canterbury and the first seal {{of the state of}} New Hampshire. In 1927, by a monastic vote, the shield design was incorporated as the official shield of Saint Anselm Abbey and the college. The drops in each quadrant represent the three drops of blood on Anselm's coat of arms, and the <b>sheaf</b> <b>of</b> five arrows is taken from the first shield of the State of New Hampshire, representing the five original counties of the state. Hence, the Abbey Shield has been interpreted as Saint Anselm of New Hampshire.|$|E
25|$|Direct and inverse images <b>of</b> <b>sheaves</b> Every {{continuous}} map f : X → Y between topological spaces induces a functor f ∗ from the category <b>of</b> <b>sheaves</b> (<b>of</b> sets, or abelian groups, or rings...) on X to the corresponding category <b>of</b> <b>sheaves</b> on Y, the direct image functor. It also induces a functor f −1 from the category <b>of</b> <b>sheaves</b> <b>of</b> abelian groups on Y to the category <b>of</b> <b>sheaves</b> <b>of</b> abelian groups on X, the inverse image functor. f −1 is left adjoint to f ∗.

5|$|Between 1892 and 1895 the Agapemonites {{built the}} Church of the Good Shepherd in Upper Clapton, London. It was {{designed}} by Joseph Morris in a Gothic style. Although it is fairly conventional in floor plan, {{the outside of the}} church is a riot of statuary and symbolism. The main doorways sport large carvings of angels and the four evangelists symbolised by a man, an eagle, a bull and a lion. The same four figures, cast in bronze, look out over the four quarters of the Earth {{from the base of the}} steeple. The two flanking weather vanes show a certain symbolic debt to William Blake's Jerusalem depicting, as they do, a fiery chariot and a <b>sheaf</b> <b>of</b> arrows (presumably of desire), while the main steeple is clearly surmounted by a spear. The stained glass windows, designed by noted children's book illustrator Walter Crane, and made by J. S. Sparrow, betray the unconventional nature of the sect as they illustrate the 'true station of womankind'. The church was abandoned after 1956 and now is used by the Georgian Orthodox Church.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Geometric Representation Theory for semi-simple Lie {{groups has}} two main sheaf theoretic models. Namely, through Beilinson-Bernstein {{localization}} theory, Harish-Chandra modules {{are related to}} holonomic <b>sheaves</b> <b>of</b> D modules on the flag variety. Then the (algebraic) Riemann-Hilbert correspondence relates these sheaves to constructible <b>sheaves</b> <b>of</b> complex vector spaces. On the other hand, there is a parallel localization theory for globalized Harish-Chandra modules—i. e., modules over the full semi-simple group which are completions of Harish-Chandra modules. In particular, Hecht-Taylor and Smithies have developed a localization theory relating minimal globalizations of Harish-Chandra modules to group equivariant <b>sheaves</b> <b>of</b> D modules on the flag variety. The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to develop an analytic Riemann-Hilbert correspondence relating these sheaves to constructible <b>sheaves</b> <b>of</b> complex vector spaces and to discuss the relationship between this “analytic ” study of global modules and the preceding “algebraic ” study of the underlying Harish-Chandra modules...|$|R
