25|$|By 1800, Jenner's {{work had}} been {{published}} in all the major European languages and had reached Benjamin Waterhouse in the United States — an indication of rapid spread and deep interest. The introduction of the vaccine to the New World took place in Trinity, Newfoundland, in 1798 by Dr. John Clinch, boyhood friend and medical colleague of Jenner. Despite <b>some</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> the safety of vaccination the mortality using carefully selected vaccine was close to zero, and it was soon in use all over Europe and the United States.|$|E
25|$|Early in the 1970s, {{interest}} was steeply declining. There was <b>some</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> the degeneration and even possible extinction of the breed. But the Portuguese revolution of 1974 helped save the Estrela. It led to changes both in dog shows in Portugal and in Portuguese dog breeds. Prior to the revolution, dog showing had largely been a pastime of the wealthy, with their preference for non-Portuguese breeds as status symbols. Now, working people could and did show the native dogs they preferred. Also, with the revolution came {{an increase in}} crime and thus more interest in guard dogs.|$|E

Additionally, Gee's 2002 announcement that the administration was going to rename Confederate Memorial Hall without the word Confederate provoked a series of lawsuits. While Vanderbilt's board expressed <b>some</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> Gee's spending, they also strongly endorsed his successful leadership. According to the Chronicle of Higher Education, he received a total compensation of over $1.8 million in 2005/6, the highest of any continuing university president in the United States.|$|E
25|$|In packing, {{children}} are wrapped tightly {{for up to}} an hour in wet sheets that have been refrigerated, with only their heads left free. The treatment is repeated several times a week, and can continue for years. It is intended as treatment for autistic children who harm themselves; most of these children cannot speak. Similar envelopment techniques have been used for centuries, such as to calm violent patients in Germany in the 19th century; its modern use in France began in the 1960s, based on psychoanalytic theories such as the theory of the refrigerator mother. Packing is currently used in hundreds of French clinics.

He had previously worked for the United Jewish Appeal, and from 1959 to 1963 was the first [...] rabbi at Syracuse University.

In June 1960 Solti was appointed musical director from the 1961 season onwards. With his previous experience {{in charge of the}} Munich and Frankfurt opera houses, he was at first uncertain that Covent Garden, not yet consistently reaching the top international level, was a post he wanted. Bruno Walter persuaded him otherwise, and he took up the musical directorship in August 1961.

500|$|Garnet's trial {{took place}} on Friday 28 March 1606. He {{was taken to the}} Guildhall by closed coach; an unusual method, {{considering}} prisoners were usually walked to trial, though the authorities may have had <b>some</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> support from a sympathetic crowd. The trial began at about 9:30am and lasted all day. [...] In attendance were King James (hidden from public view) and several courtiers including Lady Arbella Stuart and Catherine Howard, Countess of Suffolk. [...] Garnet was introduced with his various aliases, which included [...] "Whalley, otherwise Darcy, otherwise Roberts, otherwise Farmer, otherwise Philips". He was accused of having conspired with Catesby on 9 June 1605 to kill the king, his son, and to [...] "alter and subvert the government of the kingdom and the true worship of God established in England". He was also accused of having conspired with several others to blow up the House of Lords with gunpowder. He pleaded [...] "not guilty".|$|E

500|$|Approximately 500 Zanzibari men {{and women}} were killed or wounded during the bombardment, most of the dead a result of the fire that engulfed the palace. It is unknown how many of these {{casualties}} were combatants, but Khalid's gun crews were said to have been [...] "decimated". British casualties amounted to one Petty Officer severely wounded aboard Thrush who later recovered. Although the majority of the Zanzibari townspeople sided with the British, the town's Indian quarter suffered from opportunistic looting, and around twenty inhabitants lost their lives in the chaos. To restore order, 150 British Sikh troops were transferred from Mombasa to patrol the streets. Sailors from St George and Philomel were landed to form a fire brigade to contain the fire, which had spread from the palace to the nearby customs sheds. There was <b>some</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> the fire at the customs sheds as they contained a sizeable store of explosives, but no explosion occurred.|$|E
500|$|The salvage operation, made {{possible}} by several large donations, including from Sir Jack Hayward and Sir Paul Getty, was organised by 'the SS Great Britain Project', chaired by Richard Goold-Adams. Ewan Corlett conducted a naval architect's survey, reporting {{that she could be}} refloated. A submersible pontoon, Mulus III, was chartered in February 1970. A German tug, Varius II, was chartered, reaching Port Stanley on 25 March. By 13 April, after <b>some</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> a crack in the hull, the ship was mounted successfully on the pontoon and the following day the tug, pontoon and the Great Britain sailed to Port Stanley for preparations for the transatlantic voyage. The voyage (code name [...] "Voyage 47") began on 24 April, stopped in Montevideo from 2 May to 6 May for inspection, then across the Atlantic, arriving at Barry Docks, west of Cardiff on 22 June. ("Voyage 47" [...] was chosen as the code name because it was on her 47th voyage from Penarth, in 1886, that during a tempest she had sought shelter in the Falklands.) Bristol-based tugs then took over and towed her, still on her pontoon, to Avonmouth Docks.|$|E
500|$|One {{commentator}} {{has said}} that Wilfrid [...] "came into conflict with almost every prominent secular and ecclesiastical figure of the age". Hindley, a historian of the Anglo-Saxons, states that [...] "Wilfrid would not win his sainthood through the Christian virtue of humility". The historian Barbara Yorke said of him that [...] "Wilfrid's character was such {{that he seems to}} have been able to attract and infuriate in equal measure". His contemporary, Bede, although a partisan of the Roman dating of Easter, was a monk and always treats Wilfrid a little uneasily, showing <b>some</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> how Wilfrid conducted himself as a clergyman and as a bishop. The historian Eric John feels that it was Wilfrid's devotion to monasticism that led him to believe that the only way for the Church to be improved was through monasticism. John traces Wilfrid's many appeals to Rome to his motivation to hold together his monastic empire, rather than to self-interest. John also challenges the belief that Wilfrid was fond of pomp, pointing out that the comparison between the Irish missionaries who walked and Wilfrid who rode ignores the reality that the quickest method of travel in the Middle Ages was on horseback.|$|E

500|$|Flows in {{the river}} are swelled by {{discharges}} from several sewage treatment works. The three largest are at Princes Marsh, Petersfield and Ambersham, {{all of which have}} outflows between [...] per day, with another three discharging between [...] per day at Rogate, Coultershaw and Fittleworth. The entire river, including parts of some of its tributaries, is designated as a Site of Nature Conservation Importance by the local authorities through which it flows, in recognition of its value for wildlife. The upper reaches of the Rother are important for their fish populations of brown trout, grayling, juvenile sea trout, and the spawning and early development of salmonids. There are also populations of bullhead, eel, lamprey, minnow and stone loach. There has been <b>some</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> declining fish stocks, thought to be partly caused by soil erosion, leading to silt and sediments being deposited on the river bed, which has been exacerbated by low flows {{in the river}}. Parts of the lower river support the same types of fish, but there are areas, particularly immediately upstream of weirs, where the major species are bream, pike and roach, with chubb, dace and perch on the lowest reaches. In order to assist the movement of fish along the river, particularly those that migrate to the headwaters to spawn, fish passes have been constructed around the gauging stations. The only known population of native white clawed crayfish in Sussex is located in {{the upper reaches of the}} Rother.|$|E

The Reef Environmental Education Foundation provides advice to restaurant chefs on how they can incorporate the fish into their menus. The NOAA calls the lionfish a [...] "delicious, delicately flavored fish" [...] similar in texture to grouper. Recipes for lionfish include deep frying, ceviche, jerky, grilling,and sashimi.|$|E
