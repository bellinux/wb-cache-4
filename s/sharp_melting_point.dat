30|$|A {{distinction}} can be {{made between}} amorphous and semi-crystalline thermoplastics used in SLS. Limited success has been achieved with amorphous polymers such as PC which {{do not have a}} clear melting temperature range but have a glass transition temperature at ~ 100  °C above which the polymer gradually softens becoming rubbery and as temperature increases finally becomes a liquid, without clear transitions. They have a flow and sintering rate less than that of semi-crystalline polymers (such as PA 12) and so are more porous, weaker and less durable. They do however produce more dimensionally accurate parts with good resolution. Semi-crystalline polymers such as PA 12, which have <b>sharp</b> <b>melting</b> <b>points</b> and quickly become viscous liquids, can be sintered to make very dense prototypes with properties comparable to injection-moulded materials.

40|$|The {{research}} work describes the synthesis and characterization of compounds containing cyclic and heterocyclic moieties, Phthalimide and phenyl amide compounds aiming at search of new candidates to battle with microorganisms. Thanks to metals {{for being the}} charm of medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry since many decades. To widen this search, 15 potential ligands were synthesized. Compounds containing phthalimide moieties (HL 1 -HL 6) were synthesized by the reaction of various anilines with phthalic anhydride. The compounds were isolated in pure form and checked by TLC and had <b>sharp</b> <b>melting</b> <b>points.</b> The single crystal structures of the compounds were also reported and discussed. Then the compounds were treated with metal salts e. g, Zn (II), Fe (III), Cu (II), Sb (III) {{and as a result}} thirty four new metal complexes were synthesized. Further, phenylamide derivatives (HL 7 -HL 11) were synthesized by reacting anilines with acetic anhydride. HL 12 -HL 15 were synthesized by reacting substituted anilines with maleic anhydride and succinic anhydride. Forty new complexes of these amides with metals e,g Zn (II), Fe (III), Cu (II) and Sb (III) have been synthesized. All of the synthesized complexes were heat, air and moisture stable, but during the synthesis moisture and air were avoided to prevent the oxidation of the compounds using standard Schlenk line and glove box techniques. The stability profile augments the link between organometallics and drug design and discovery. The purity of all synthesized compounds was conventionally monitored with the help of TLC in different solvents. All synthesized compounds and their complexes with transition metals were characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, GC-MS, 1 H and 13 C-NMR spectroscopy. The structures were finally confirmed with the help of single crystal structures. All synthesized compounds and their metal complexes were evaluated for their carbonic anhydrase inhibition, intestinal alkaline phosphatase inhibition, antileshminial, anti oxidant, cytotoxic and antibacterial activities. The results of these bioassays are also reported and discussed in detail. The phenylamide ligands showed good carbonic anhydrase inhibition, as compared to phthalimides ligands. Further, the activity was enhanced by 40 - 60 % in case of antimony complexes but the zinc complexes have shown slightly less carbonic anhydrase inhibition. Similarly, the complexes of antimony with amide ligands have shown excellent IAP inhibitory activities, while the zinc complexes have shown a maximum potential against IAP inhibition. Although most of the compounds are found to be good antileshminial inhibitors, the results have proved that the metal complexes of Zn, Cu and especially Sb have increased activities as compared to parent free ligands. Additionally, the said complexes also showed enhanced cytotoxic activities against BHK- 21 and H- 157 cell lines. The antibacterial activity against Gram â€“ve and Gram +ve bacteria were outstanding in case of metal complexes with the phthalimide ligand HL 2. Results of antibacterial screening of compounds as percent inhibition against bacteria are reported. Overall, these newly synthesized metal complexes have provided important candidates for drug discovery.

40|$|Bacterial mats called biofilms {{that form}} on the {{surfaces}} of industrial steel pipes can cause corrosion of the pipe. Examining the steel surface of the corroded pipe usually involves removal of the biofilm using acid. This acid can also cause corrosion of the pipe so that the observed corrosion cracks and pits {{are the result of}} both the acid and the biofilm. It was thought that non-invasive examination of the corrosion caused by the biofilm may be obtained by using a thin wire bent into a loop that acts as both a heat source a nd a detector of heat, measuring the changes in heat flow out of the wire as the wire passes over the steel with the biofilm still present. This technique of using a heated probe to scan samples on a microscopic scale is called Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) and uses an alternating current to produce a. c. thermal waves that emanate from the probe tip into the sample. The alternating current allows better signal-to-noise ratios and also selective depth imaging of the sample since the thermal wave penetrates into the sample a distance inversely proportional to the applied current frequency. Reversal in the contrast of SThM images on biofilms and subsequently all samples was observed as either the frequency or the amplitude of the temperature waves was altered. Whilst changing the time constant of the feedback circuit attached to the SThM probe did go some way to explain this effect, a full explanation is still wanting. Despite many efforts to image the biofilm/steel interface with the biofilm still present, often the biofilm was either too thick or too complicated to do this. A simpler thermal test sample is required to calibrate the thermal probe. In addition to SThM, one may select a point on a sample surface and ramp the temperature of the probe to obtain a Localised Thermal Analysis (LTA) temperature scan looking for melts, recrystallisations, glass transitions of the part of the sample in contact with the probe. This technique is a miniaturised version of Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimetry where two pans are used, one containing the sample and one containing air as a reference. In LTA, a second probe is used in air near to the sample as a reference and the difference between the voltages across the two probes is recorded, this difference being related to the thermal properties of the sample. LTA has been carried out on poly(ethylene terephthalate), bismuth, indium, and solder, with bismuth showing a <b>sharp</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point.</b> An attempt to understand the effect of the sample material on the heat flow out of the probe in SThM was made by constructing a simple two-layer semi-infinite planar mathematical model of the probe/air gap/sample setup used in SThM. The model showed that for large air gaps the effect of changing the sample was minimal, whereas for small air gaps considerable variation in the heat flow was observed that strongly depended on the thermal conductivity of the sample and the frequency of the applied current through the probe. A series of experiments were then carried out to verify the results of the model and the results agreed to within 50 % despite the oversimplified nature of the model, due to the highly diffusive nature of the thermal waves.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Sodium in coal {{has been}} {{associated}} with the fouling of heat transfer surfaces of boilers for many years even though its role has not been understood in detail. Currently, a theoretical and experimental study has been undertaken to investigate the reactions and reaction mechanisms of sodium with sulphur species and with inherent silica and kaolin during coal combustion and the cooling of the combustion gases. The dependence of these reactions on the form of the sodium in the coal and the combustion temperature has also been assessed. The experimental investigations involved combusting synthetic coals in which the concentrations, the size and the distribution of the inorganic constituents were controlled. These coals were prepared by adding into a slurry of demineralised Loy Yang brown coal, known quantities of inorganic constituents - sodium as a solution of sodium chloride or sodium acetate and as required, size graded silica or kaolin. The slurry was dried, pulverised and sieved to obtain the 63 - 90 μm size fraction used in the experiments. The coals were combusted in a drop tube furnace and the supra micron product ash was collected in a heated cyclone, upstream of a filter to collect the submicron condensed sodium salts. As well as coal composition, other experimental variables examined, were the furnace wall temperatures of 1000 °C, 1200 °C and 1400 °C, coal feed rates of 5. 5 g/h and 2. 7 g/h, position and temperature at which the reaction products were quenched and collected, and the addition of gaseous sulphur dioxide with the secondary air equivalent to 3 % sulphur in the dry coal. The collected ash was analysed by wet chemical methods, examined by electron microscope and sized by a Malvern laser diffraction particle size analyser. The experimental program included the determination of coal particle temperatures by combusting a synthetic coal with inherent ash which was stable under combustion conditions and had a <b>sharp</b> <b>melting</b> <b>point.</b> The data from these experiments was used as input to a combustion model to establish the char reactivity which was then used in the same model to predict combustion parameters for the range of conditions employed in the other experiments. The experiments to investigate the reactions of sodium chloride with sulphur oxides in combustion gases, showed that below 1000 °C, the sulphation of sodium chloride was kinetically limited for times which are normally available in p. c. fired boilers. For temperatures above 1100 °C, the extent of sulkphation was found to be greater than that predicted at the thermodynamic equilibrium for the overall system, possibly due to the formation of the radicals NaSO₂ and NaSO₃ during combustion. From the experiments to study the reactions of sodium with silica, it was found that sodium silicates formed almost exclusively during coal combustion, probably due to the progressive agglomeration and coalescence of the ash reducing the surface of silica available for reaction. The rate of silicate formation increased with temperature but this was largely offset by a parallel reduction in combustion time, resulting in only small changes in the extent of formation with temperature. Generally, the extent of silicate formation was greatest at 1200 °C and least at 1000 °C. The presence of chlorine and to a much lesser extent sulphur, reduced the formation of sodium silicate. By firing coals which contained a mixture of two separately prepared coals, one with a sodium salt and the other with only silica, it was shown that at gas temperatures of 1200 °C- 1400 °C, sodium was completely released from the coal {{prior to the start of}} silicate formation. At 1000 °C, both organic sodium and sodium chloride were probably not fully released before silicate formation commenced. Exploratory experiments with kaolin evidenced that sodium, as sodium chloride, reacted to a greater extent with kaolin than with silica. Qualitative agreement was found between the experimental results and the thermodynamic equilibrium predictions of the influence of chlorine, sulphur, alumina and sodium concentration on the extent of sodium silicate or sodium aluminium silicate formation. Equilibrium calculations indicated that calcium or magnesium would reduce the extent of combination of sodium with silica. Theoretical predictions of the release rate of sodium from coal, during combustion, also agreed in general with experimental results. A theoretical model was developed to study the reaction of organic sodium with silica during coal combustion. From this model it was concluded that the reaction rate was controlled initially by the diffusion of sodium hydroxide in the char boundary layer but as combustion proceeded, the diffusion of sodium oxide in the product silicate melt combined with the diffusion of sodium hydroxide through the porous char increasing influenced the reaction rate. The results of the study show that the influence of sodium on the severity of fouling in boilers is dependent on the form and concentration of the sodium in the coal, the composition of the coal's other inorganic constituents and the combustion and furnace conditions...|$|E
