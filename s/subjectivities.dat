5|$|The {{problem of}} {{subjectivity}} and objectivity {{can be divided}} into a concern over the general possibilities of social actions, and, on the other hand the specific problem of social scientific knowledge. In the former, the subjective is often equated (though not necessarily) with the individual, and the individual's intentions and interpretations of the objective. The objective is often considered any public or external action or outcome, on up to society writ large. A primary question for social theorists is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective-objective-subjective, that is to say: how is intersubjectivity achieved? While, historically, qualitative methods have attempted to tease out subjective interpretations, quantitative survey methods also attempt to capture individual <b>subjectivities.</b> Also, some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description in situ.|$|E

25|$|These {{aspects of}} third-wave {{feminism}} {{arose in the}} mid-1980s. Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave like Gloria Anzaldúa, bell hooks, Chela Sandoval, Cherríe Moraga, Audre Lorde, Luisa Accati, Maxine Hong Kingston, and many other feminists of color, called for a new subjectivity in feminist voice. They wanted prominent feminist thought to consider race-related <b>subjectivities.</b> This focus on the intersection between race and gender remained prominent through the 1991 Hill–Thomas hearings, but began to shift with the Freedom Ride 1992, a drive to register voters in poor minority communities whose rhetoric intended to rally young feminists. For many, the rallying of the young is the common link within third-wave feminism.|$|E
40|$|I inspect {{in a brief}} {{theoretical}} - philosophical essay {{the roots}} of <b>subjectivity</b> and suggest many possible directions for examining the phenomenon of <b>subjectivity</b> so that multiple different meanings can be revealed. For instance, a researcher can explore her or his own <b>subjectivity</b> or he/she can attempt to define <b>subjectivity</b> per se or the researcher can uncover <b>subjectivity</b> or merely learn about <b>subjectivity.</b> I propose that <b>subjectivity</b> is an inner essence of flux and ask if it is even possible to fully capture a researcher’s <b>subjectivity.</b> Another proposition is to view <b>subjectivity</b> as an inner essence {{of each and every}} individual. Finally, I conclude that to demarcate <b>subjectivity</b> as opposite to objectivity is the least fruitful way to uncover the ultimate core of <b>subjectivity</b> – the multiple connections toward a vital balance of any type of research endeavor...|$|R

500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s in the USA, third-wave {{feminism}} {{began as a}} response to perceived failures of the second wave and to the backlash against initiatives and movements created by the second wave. Third-wave feminism distinguished itself from the second wave around issues of sexuality, challenging female heterosexuality and celebrating sexuality as a means of female empowerment. Third-wave feminism also seeks to challenge or avoid what it deems the second wave's essentialist definitions of femininity, which, they argue, over-emphasize the experiences of upper middle-class white women. Third-wave feminists often focus on [...] "" [...] and challenge the second wave's paradigm as to what is, or is not, good for women, and tend to use a post-structuralist interpretation of gender and sexuality. Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave, such as Gloria Anzaldúa, bell hooks, Chela Sandoval, Cherríe Moraga, Audre Lorde, Maxine Hong Kingston, and many other non-white feminists, sought to negotiate a space within feminist thought for consideration of race-related <b>subjectivities.</b> Third-wave feminism also contains internal debates between difference feminists, who believe that there are important differences between the sexes, and those who believe that there are no inherent differences between the sexes and contend that gender roles are due to social conditioning.|$|E

Student objections may be due to ideological reasons, religious or moral convictions, fear of criticism, or discomfort with controversial issues. Kristen Seas argues: [...] "Resistance in this context thus occurs when students are asked to shift not only their perspectives, but also their <b>subjectivities</b> as they accept or reject assumptions that contribute to the pedagogical arguments being constructed." [...] Karen Kopelson asserts that resistance to new information or ideologies, introduced in the classroom, is a natural response to persuasive messages that are unfamiliar.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{and tests}} a framework examining {{the relationship between}} <b>subjectivity</b> in performance evaluation and managerial performance. The framework predicts that <b>subjectivity</b> in performance evaluation is positively associated with psychological empowerment and supervisor-subordinate conflict. As previous studies established a positive association between empowerment and performance, and a negative association between conflict and performance, it is suggested in this thesis that <b>subjectivity</b> in performance evaluation has {{both positive and negative}} indirect associations with managerial performance. The investigation was undertaken using a sample of 102 anonymous managers who completed a mail survey. The data analysis was done using Partial Least Squares. This study finds that <b>subjectivity</b> in performance evaluation is a multidimensional construct. <b>Subjectivity</b> was split into two variables: process-based <b>subjectivity</b> and supervisor-based <b>subjectivity.</b> Both variables were related to managerial performance through positive and negative indirect associations. Process-based <b>subjectivity</b> is similar to supervisor-based <b>subjectivity</b> regarding its effect on supervisor-subordinate conflict, but it differs concerning its effect on access to information. This study is important as it investigates the competing effects of <b>subjectivity</b> in performance evaluation upon managerial performance. Further, the findings suggest that supervisor-subordinate conflict and access to information fully mediate the association between <b>subjectivity</b> and psychological empowerment. The contribution of this study to the literature lies in developing a new scale to measure <b>subjectivity</b> in performance evaluation and in providing additional empirical evidence regarding the effects of <b>subjectivity</b> in performance evaluation on managerial performance...|$|R

40|$|<b>Subjectivity</b> lexicons {{have been}} {{invaluable}} resources in <b>subjectivity</b> analysis and their creation {{has been an}} important topic. Many systems rely on these lexicons. For any <b>subjectivity</b> analysis system, which relies on a <b>subjectivity</b> lexicon, <b>subjectivity</b> sense ambiguity is a serious problem. Such systems will be misled by the presence of <b>subjectivity</b> clues used with objective senses called false hits. We believe that any type of <b>subjectivity</b> analysis system relying on lexicons will benefit from a sense-aware approach. We think sense-aware <b>subjectivity</b> analysis has been neglected mostly because of the concerns related to word sense disambiguation (WSD), the problem of automatically determining which sense of a word is activated by {{the use of the word}} in a particular context according to a sense-inventory. Although WSD is the perfect tool for sense-aware classification, trust in traditional fine-grained WSD as an enabling technology is not high due to previous mostly unsuccessful results. In this thesis, we investigate feasible and practical methods to avoid these false hits via sense-aware analysis. We define a new coarse-grained WSD task capturing the right semantic granularity specific to <b>subjectivity</b> analysis...|$|R
