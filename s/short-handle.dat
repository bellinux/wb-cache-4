50|$|The human {{damage caused}} by {{long-term}} use of <b>short-handled</b> hoes, which required the user to bend over from the waist to reach the ground, and caused permanent, crippling lower back pain to farm workers, resulted, after struggle led by César Chávez with political help from Governor Jerry Brown in the California Supreme Court declaring the <b>short-handled</b> hoe to be an unsafe hand tool that was banned under California law in 1975.|$|R
50|$|The mace (gurj), a <b>short-handled</b> {{club with}} three large round balls at the end, usually formed {{part of the}} {{weaponry}} of any Mughul warrior of considerable rank.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "hand hoe" [...] most {{commonly}} refers to {{any type of}} light-weight, <b>short-handled</b> hoe, {{although it may be}} used simply to contrast hand-held tools against animal or machine pulled tools.|$|R
50|$|The CRLA {{has been}} {{involved}} in litigation that led to the ban of DDT, brought legal challenges to the practice of placing non-English-speaking students in special education classes, and the ban of the cortito, the <b>short-handled</b> hoe.|$|R
25|$|There {{are also}} a number of specialist, <b>short-handled</b> adzes used by coopers, wainwrights, chair makers, and bowl and trough making. Many of these have shorter handles for control and more curve in the head to allow better {{clearance}} for shorter cuts.|$|R
50|$|Soviet Spetsnaz {{units were}} well {{trained in the}} use of the {{standard}} <b>short-handled</b> Russian entrenching shovel ("saperka") as a weapon; by the nature of their missions, such tools were only rarely used for digging or entrenching positions. Modern commando forces, too, are trained to fight with entrenchment tools.|$|R
25|$|In 1985 Jessie {{was invited}} to speak to {{government}} officials about her experiences using the <b>short-handled</b> hoe, and how it created lifelong dehibilitating back injuries for herself and other farm workers. She asked government officials to walk around for a day holding the tips of their shoes. Later, California Legislators outlawed the hoe.|$|R
5000|$|A trident, the weaponised {{form of the}} serampang or three-pronged fishing-spear. A related {{weapon is}} the lembing tikam pari or three-barbed spear. Asian mythology links the trident with the supernatural, so it is {{sometimes}} called tongkat sakti or magic staff. The word trisula is sometimes also used when referring to the tekpi or <b>short-handled</b> trident ...|$|R
50|$|In India and Thailand, {{the term}} also often {{refers to a}} <b>short-handled</b> weapon which may be mounted on a danda or staff. But unlike the Okinawan sai, the trishula is often bladed. In Malay and Indonesian, trisula usually refers {{specifically}} to a long-handled trident while the diminutive version is more commonly known as a chabang or tekpi.|$|R
5000|$|The tekpi is a <b>short-handled</b> trident from Southeast Asia. Known as tekpi in Malay, it {{is called}} chabang or cabang (Dutch spelling: tjabang meaning [...] "branch") in Indonesian, siang tépi (雙短鞭 lit. [...] "double short whip") in Hokkien, and trisul (ตรีศูล meaning [...] "trident") in Thai. More than a weapon, it was also {{important}} as a Hindu-Buddhist symbol.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{following}} passage, Leyden describes {{the conditions in}} which the miners worked: [...] "The coal mines were often tiny by the standard of most industrialised countries. The men often had to lie on their backs in water, using a handpick or <b>short-handled</b> shovel to get at a thin seam of coal under a ledge of rock." ...|$|R
60|$|Between {{them and}} the city raged a terrific battle. The fair-skinned warriors, armed only with their long bows {{and a kind of}} <b>short-handled</b> war-axe, were almost {{helpless}} beneath the savage mounted green men at close quarters; but at a distance their sharp arrows did fully as much execution as the radium projectiles of the green men.|$|R
5000|$|Engineer's hammer, a <b>short-handled</b> hammer, {{originally}} {{an essential}} {{components of a}} railroad engineer's toolkit for working on steam locomotives. [...] Typical weight is 2-4 lbs (0.9-1.8 kg) with a 12-14 inch (30-35 cm) handle. Originally these were often cross-peen hammers, with one round face and one wedge-peen face, but in modern usage the term primarily refers to hammers with two round faces.|$|R
50|$|Archaeological {{findings}} and classical dances bear {{testament to the}} myriad of weapons that were once used in Thailand. Some of them are no longer found in the country's martial arts today, such as the kris (dagger), hawk (spear), trisul (either long or <b>short-handled</b> trident), daab (straight sword) and vajra. Entire dances were built on individual weapons, and calisthenics used by the modern Thai military are still based on these dances.|$|R
60|$|The Eskimo sledge is a {{contrivance}} of wood {{capable of}} accommodating {{five or six}} men, and usually drawn {{by a team of}} from six to ten dogs, each dog being fastened to it by means of a separate line of tough walrus-hide. In a short time the long-lashed, <b>short-handled,</b> powerful whips cracked, the teams yelped, the men shouted, and away they all went with much noise over the frozen sea.|$|R
60|$|On {{either side}} of the {{ammunition}} pouch, behind, was strapped a new boot; so placed that it in no way interfered with the bearer getting at the pouch. Next was fastened the tin box; the lid of which forms a plate, the bottom a saucepan or frying pan. On one side hung the bayonet; upon the other a hatchet, a pick, or a <b>short-handled</b> shovel--each company having ten of each implement.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{as to the}} escape, monsieur. Here is a sharp saw. With it you can cut {{round the}} lock of your door. There are two outside bolts, whose {{position}} I dare say you have noticed; by cutting a hole close to each of them, {{you can get your}} hand through and draw them. Here is a <b>short-handled</b> augur, to make a hole for the saw to go through.|$|R
6000|$|Harvey {{grabbed at}} a rope and long iron hook {{dangling}} {{from one of}} the stays of the mainmast, while Dan pulled down another that ran from something he called a [...] "topping-lift," [...] as Manuel drew alongside in his loaded dory. The Portuguese smiled a brilliant smile that Harvey learned to know well later, and a <b>short-handled</b> fork began to throw fish into the pen on deck. [...] "Two hundred and thirty-one," [...] he shouted.|$|R
60|$|As the Eskimo spoke, the yelping of dogs outside {{told that}} his sons had obeyed his commands, and got ready the sledge. Without another word he crept {{out of the}} hut and jumped on the sledge, which was covered {{with two or three}} warm bearskins. Ermigit {{restrained}} the dogs, of which there were about eight, each fastened to the vehicle by a single line. Norrak handed his father the <b>short-handled</b> but heavy, long-lashed whip.|$|R
60|$|Then Theudebert and his false Franks {{came down}} {{to see what they}} could get; all (save a few knights round the king) on foot, without bow or lance; but armed with sword, shield, and heavy <b>short-handled</b> {{double-edged}} francisc, or battle-axe. At the bridge over the Ticinus they (nominal Catholics) sacrificed Gothic women and children with horrid rites, fought alike Goths and Romans, lost a third of their army by dysentery, and went home again.|$|R
50|$|A slick {{is a large}} chisel, {{characterized}} by a wide (2-4 inches, 5-10 cm), heavy blade, and a long, frequently slender, socketed handle. The combined blade and handle can reach two feet (60 cm) in length. The blade of a slick is slightly curved lengthwise, and/or the handle socket is cranked upward, such that the handle and socket clear {{the surface of the}} work when the edge is touching. This distinguishes the slick from the similarly-sized, <b>short-handled</b> millwright's chisel.|$|R
40|$|Agricultural workers {{performing}} manual weeding {{are exposed}} to high risks of musculoskeletal disorders to the lower back. Hand weeding exposes workers to sustained static loading to spinal soft tissues, {{which can lead to}} the initiation of a cycle of inflammatory response. Assessment of injury risks and investigation of current and new methods of manual weeding are the focus of this study. Nine subjects (7 males and 2 females) participated in this study. Trunk kinematics were monitored while workers performed four weeding tasks using different methods; long- and <b>short-handled</b> weeding (hoe and weed Puller), hand weeding, and a newly developed "Eater". The Eater consists of two conveyor belts working simultaneously in an intermesh design to simulate the pulling and grabbing action of the hands. Hoe weeding is considered a less hazardous alternative to hand weeding with regards to back injuries but, our results showed otherwise. The worker’s sagittal position with the hoe weeding was not significantly different from the <b>short-handled</b> tool. Also, workers weeding with the hoe displayed the highest trunk velocities. On the other hand, the Eater showed promising results by significantly reducing biomechanical risk factors. However, productivity results are not as promising...|$|R
5000|$|The system employs very {{specific}} techniques including {{the addition of}} straw and other vegetable wastes to the soil {{in order to maintain}} soil fertility. Gardeners following the system use soil-covering mulches, and employ non-compacting surface cultivation techniques using any <b>short-handled,</b> wide-bladed, hand hoe. They kneel when surface cultivating, placing a board under their knees to spread out the pressure, and prevent soil compaction. Kenneth Dalziel O'Brien published a description of his system in Veganic Gardening, the Alternative System for Healthier Crops: ...|$|R
50|$|The word {{traveled}} swiftly, up {{and down}} the coast, and by nightfall the downtown streets were crowded with people who had come {{from as far away as}} South Point and the Waipio Valley to see for themselves if the rumor was really true - that Lono had, in fact, returned in the form of a huge drunken maniac who dragged fish out of the sea with his bare hands and then beat them to death on the dock with a <b>short-handled</b> Samoan war club.|$|R
5000|$|After high school, Nelson {{worked for}} a while with Mexican {{immigrants}} thinning sugar beets near Stockton, California with a <b>short-handled</b> hoe. It was hard low-paid work, and made him sharply aware of the falsity of the myth that Mexicans are lazy. [...] "They were the warmest, friendliest and highest-spirited people I have ever known," [...] he observed, [...] "and fueled my interest in things Mexican." [...] Later he worked at forty or fifty different jobs, trying to get different and new perspectives on the world. He learned to speak Spanish fluently.|$|R
5000|$|These {{types of}} <b>short-handled</b> clubs were mainly {{used as a}} {{striking}} weapon. The blow administered with this weapon was a horizontal thrust straight from the shoulder at the enemy’s temple. If the foe could be grasped by the hair then the patu would be driven up under the ribs or jaw. Patu were made from hardwood, whale bone, or stone. The most prestigious material for the patu was pounamu (greenstone). Patu made from pounamu were generally called [...] "mere". Maori decorated the patu by carving into the wood, bone or stone.|$|R
5000|$|In 1910 the U.S. Army {{adopted the}} M-1910 haversack (or M10) as the {{standard}} back pack for all infantrymen. The pack is essentially a sheet of rugged khaki-colored canvas that folds around its contents (bedroll, clothing, daily rations, and assorted personal items), and is held together by flaps and adjustable buckle-straps. The two shoulder straps are designed to attach to a web belt or suspender configuration. The exterior of the pack has loops, rings, and grommet tabs for attaching a bayonet sheath, a [...] "meat can" [...] (mess kit) pouch, and a canvas carrier for a <b>short-handled</b> shovel (a.k.a. entrenchment tool).|$|R
60|$|Then Whisky Bob and Nicky the Greek arrived, sober, indignant, outraged in {{that their}} fellow pirates had raised their plant. French Frank, aided by John Barleycorn, orated hypocritically about virtue and honesty, and, despite his fifty years, got Whisky Bob {{out on the}} sand and {{proceeded}} to lick him. When Nicky the Greek jumped in with a <b>short-handled</b> shovel to Whisky Bob's assistance, short work was made of him by Hans. And of course, when the bleeding remnants of Bob and Nicky were sent packing in their skiff, the event must needs be celebrated in further carousal.|$|R
50|$|Dominican amber {{especially}} Dominican blue amber - is mined through bell pitting, {{which is}} extremely dangerous. The bell pit {{is basically a}} foxhole dug with whatever tools are available. Machetes do the start, some shovels, picks and hammers may participate eventually. The pit itself goes as deep as possible or safe, sometimes vertical, sometimes horizontal, but never level. It snakes into hill sides, drops away, joins up with others, goes straight up and pops out elsewhere. 'Foxhole' applies indeed: rarely are the pits large enough to stand in, and then only at the entrance. Miners crawl around on their knees using <b>short-handled</b> picks, shovels and machetes.|$|R
5000|$|His {{interest}} in social justice organizations grew {{and they became}} both {{the subject of his}} documentary photography and his politics. He used showings of his photography to speak about social injustice. His 1979 [...] "The <b>Short-Handled</b> Hoe" [...] from Hidalgo, Texas exposed the cruelty of growers forcing field workers to bend over solely to discern whether they were working. [...] He documented the work of the United Farm Workers, and photographed its leaders, Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. [...] Pogue provided a 1993 photograph titled 'Farmworker Women' to support the National Center for Farmworker Health. The 'Migrant Clinicians Network' is a beneficiary of Pogue's support.|$|R
60|$|The estafette came {{as usual}} {{galloping}} up the road, brandishing {{over his head}} a <b>short-handled</b> whip, with a long knotted lash; every smack of which made a report like a pistol. He was a tight square-set young fellow, in the customary uniform--a smart blue coat, ornamented with facings and gold lace, but so short behind as to reach scarcely below his waistband, and cocked up not unlike {{the tail of a}} wren. A cocked hat, edged with gold lace; a pair of stiff riding boots; but instead of the usual leathern breeches he had a fragment of a pair of drawers that scarcely furnished an apology for modesty to hide behind.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{show your}} Grace," [...] and without more ado, to {{the horror of}} Cicely, Thomas tumbled from his sack all his hellish garb and set to work to clothe himself. In a minute, for he was practised at the game, the hideous mask was on his head, {{and with it the}} horns and skin of the widow's billy-goat; the tail and painted hides were tied about him, and in his hand he waved the eel spear, <b>short-handled</b> now. Thus arrayed he capered before the {{astonished}} King and Queen, shaking the tail that had a wire in it and clattering his hoofs upon the floor.|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{tattooing}} is {{a painful}} process. The Samoan tattoo master dips his cutting tools into black ink {{made from the}} soot of burnt candlenut shells and then punctures designs into the skin. The cutting tool consists of a short piece of bamboo or light wood {{with a piece of}} tortoiseshell bound at right angles at one end. A little bone comb is bound to the lower broad end of the tortoiseshell. The larger the comb, the greater the area on the skin is covered with fewer strokes. The master uses a small mallet to repeatedly tap a <b>short-handled</b> instrument. The process takes days and is sometimes partially accomplished over longer periods, with recuperation in between.|$|R
60|$|Also, I am {{learning}} to throw leather. If any tyro {{thinks it is}} easy to take a <b>short-handled,</b> long-lashed whip, and throw the end of that lash just where he wants it, let him put on automobile goggles and try it. On reconsideration, I would suggest the substitution of a wire fencing-mask for the goggles. For days I looked at that whip. It fascinated me, and the fascination was composed mostly of fear. At my first attempt, Charmian and Nakata became afflicted with the same sort of fascination, {{and for a long time}} afterward, whenever they saw me reach for the whip, they closed their eyes and shielded their heads with their arms.|$|R
25|$|Jessie Lopez De La Cruz (1919 – September 2, 2013) was a Chicano American farm worker, {{the first}} female {{recruiter}} for the UFW, an organizer and participant in UFW strikes, a community organizer, a working mother, and a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention. She ran the first UFW Hiring Hall, was {{an adviser to the}} California Commission on the Status of Women, and the secretary treasurer of National Land for People (an organization that worked to break up land monopolies in the San Joaquin Valley). Lopez-De La Cruz is also known for her work banning the <b>short-handled</b> hoe, her work educating fellow farm workers, her work promoting co-op farming, and her commitment to fighting injustice for the working poor.|$|R
50|$|The tekpi is {{believed}} to have been derived from the Indian trishula, a trident which can be either long or <b>short-handled.</b> The tekpi itself is occasionally referred to as a trisula, especially in Indonesia. The earliest evidence of the tekpi comes from Srivijaya in Indonesia where it was originally used defensively like a shield. Other sources propose that it was brought to Southeast Asia from China, but the tekpi in Sumatra predates its earliest known use in China and it seems unlikely for the Chinese to introduce an Indian weapon to a region already heavily influenced by the culture of India. Use of the tekpi probably spread with the influence of Indian religion and eventually reached Malaysia, Okinawa, China, Thailand, and other parts of Indochina.|$|R
