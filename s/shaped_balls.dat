40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{properties of}} oval <b>shaped</b> <b>balls,</b> rugby balls and Australian Rules (AFL) football, exhibit peculiar trends which impacts sharply {{on the balls}} flight trajectory; with a kicking efficiency of only 60 % amongst elite footballers in AFL and NRL, understanding the physics behind oval <b>shaped</b> <b>balls</b> can be very perplexing. Very little literature has been made available on the aerodynamic characterisitics of oval <b>shaped</b> <b>balls,</b> under non-spinning conditions. THe rugby and AFL footballs are asymmetric by design, and hence can rotate both laterally and longitudinally, not to mention an offset angle to these axes of rotation. Initial tests of three differing rugby balls, positioned at a zero pitch angle but with a varying yaw angle have been analysed with curious results. Subsequently, a look into the flow around these balls was studied using flow visualisation methods of wool tuft and smoke flow...|$|E

Despite {{the popularity of the}} game, it appears that little information on the aerodynamic force experienced by an American football, especially under crosswinds is available in the open literature. The shape of an American football {{is similar to that of}} an ellipsoid. It has more pointed ends and has a rough surface. The ball used in college level teams possesses a pair of seams at each of pointed ends. All these features and crosswind make the airflow around the ball more complex. The primary purpose of this study is to experimentally measure the aerodynamic forces of professional (NFL) and College levels (NCAA) American footballs under a range of wind speeds and yaw angles. The non-dimensional drag coefficients were determined and compared. The results indicate that the American footballs possess drag coefficient close to that of other oval <b>shaped</b> <b>balls</b> such as Rugby and Australian rule footballs. It also shows that the drag coefficient can be almost four times higher under crosswinds...|$|E
40|$|American {{football}} {{is one of}} the most popular sports in North America. It is enjoyed both by participants and spectators. The centre piece of the games is the oval shaped ball. The flight trajectory of an American football largely depends on its aerodynamic characteristics. Despite the popularity of the game, it appears that scant information on the aerodynamic force experienced by an American {{football is}} available in the open literature. Although attempts were made to construct the flight trajectory of the ball, without knowing the aerodynamic drag coefficient, it is hard to build such a model. The shape of an American football is similar to that of an ellipsoid. It has more pointed ends and rough surfaces. The ball used in college level teams possesses a pair of seams at the pointed ends. This makes the airflow around the ball even more complex. The primary purpose of this study is to experimentally measure the aerodynamic forces of American footballs used at professional and college levels under a range of wind speeds and yaw angles.

40|$|The Goldsworthy Chalk Stones, 14 roughly <b>shaped</b> <b>balls</b> of chalk, each {{approximately}} 2 m in diameter, {{were installed}} in June 2002. Initial assessments by the artist, Andy Goldsworthy, and the Strange Partners commissioning team {{concluded that they}} would last for about 2 years. The balls' disintegration has been measured {{as part of an}} ongoing scientific monitoring programme designed to assess their durability and to study controls on rates of chalk weathering. Preliminary assessment of the first 3 years of data shows that 76 % of the total mass loss occurred during year 1, 19 % during year 2 and 5 % during year 3. This might reflect the fact that winter rainfall amounts decreased substantially over the period of study. The west facing sides of the balls have tended to show greater mass loss than those facing east, which might also be a function of exposure to rain. Judging from their present slow rates of weathering, the balls will last for over 200 years but an exceptionally cold wet winter might cause sudden and massive breakdown. Three models of chalk mass weathering are presented. The ongoing scientific monitoring programme will focus experimental work on four key research themes: process, lithology, environment and stress history...|$|E
