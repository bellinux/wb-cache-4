40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} of shunt VAR systems (SVSs) on a model machine network illustrate {{the desirability of}} changes in the control system of the SVS as the operating conditions of the network vary. The fast time constant and the increase of stabilizing effectiveness at high load angles both favour the use of SVSs in damping of power system oscillations. As with AVRs, the control algorithms to give good damping must use signals other than voltage error.

40|$|Control {{strategies}} for power <b>swing</b> <b>damping</b> which use wide-area feedback signals {{need to be}} robust to partial/complete loss of communication and changes in operating points and topology. In addition, {{they should have a}} positive effect on all controllable swing modes and ensure adequate stability margins to avoid destabilization of untargeted modes. This paper proposes a control strategy for multiple embedded dc links (multiterminal or multiinfeed), which has all these attributes and is inherently able to provide wideband damping. The strategy uses only a limited set of nonlocal signals. These signals may be directly communicated to the dc links without having to be centrally collated with other system-wide measurements, thereby reducing communication delays. The strategy can easily be adapted during power system operation to achieve targeted damping of the critical swing modes...|$|R

To perform this task, {{it is necessary to}} investigate the impact of LPS on small-signal stability of power network. To study the impact and performance of LPS on low-frequency oscillatory modes, a systematic scheme is developed to achieve an accurate model of multi-machine power network including of the LPS technology. A fully-described LPS model with all network-relevant control functions will be obtained. The proposed model has been then employed in the study of financial compensation strategy of security service provided by the LPS controller. The proposed compensation strategy in this paper is based on correlation of <b>swing</b> <b>damping</b> rate (SDR) criterion with generation cost (GC) criterion as dynamic and pecuniary indices, respectively.

50|$|Swing bowlers are pace bowlers who, {{apart from}} being fast, also use the seam of the ball to make it travel in a curved path through the air. This is further {{encouraged}} by systematically polishing {{one side of the}} ball while allowing the other side to become roughened and worn. The differing airflow around the two sides will cause the ball to swing in the air, towards the roughened side. By changing the orientation of the ball in his hand, a bowler may therefore cause the ball to swing into or away from the batsman. In addition to a well-polished ball, other factors help the ball to <b>swing,</b> notably <b>damp</b> or humid weather conditions. However balls which have been in play for some time do not tend to swing so much due to the deterioration of the seam. In addition, bowlers of express pace do not tend to get as much swing as the fast-medium-to-medium pace bowlers.|$|R
40|$|Transportation {{of large}} objects using {{traditional}} bridge crane can induce pendulum motion (swing) of the object. In environments such as factory the energy {{contained in the}} swinging mass can be large and therefore attempts to move the mass onto target while still swinging can cause considerable damage. Oscillations must be damped or allowed to decay before the next process can take place. Stopping the swing {{can be accomplished by}} moving the bridge in a manner to counteract the swing which sometimes can be done by skilled operator, or by waiting for the <b>swing</b> to <b>damp</b> sufficiently that the object can be moved to the target without risk of damage. One of the methods that can be utilized for oscillation suppression is input preshaping. The validity of this method depends on the exact knowledge of the system dynamics. This method can be modified to provide some degrees of robustness with respect to unknown dynamics but at the cost of the speed of transient response.

DESIGN: Ten unilateral transfemoral amputees wearing conventional pneumatic swing phase control (conventional prosthesis) prostheses walked {{on a treadmill}} which enforced a pattern of constantly varying speeds. The subjects simultaneously performed a simple or a complex distracting task. Following a period of accustomization, the subjects performed the same test wearing a prosthesis with microprocessor control of <b>swing</b> phase <b>damping</b> (the Intelligent Prosthesis). OUTCOME MEASURES: The three-dimensional trajectory (sway) of a retroreflective marker attached to the forehead was measured by a video-based motion analysis system, and used {{as a measure of}} gait quality. The ratio of the sway for the complex task over the simple task (the 'automation index') was used as a measure of the degree of automation of gait. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the automation index between the two devices. However, the total sway for the conventional prosthesis was significantly higher. Sway during the complex distracting task was significantly higher than during the simple task.

40|$|Transfemoral amputees exhibit both {{increased}} metabolic {{consumption and}} gait asymmetry during level ground walking. A variable damping control {{strategy has been}} developed for swing extension {{in order to improve}} gait symmetry and reduce energy expenditure during level ground walking. Preliminary biomechanical studies suggest that the knee utilizes a variable <b>damping</b> control during <b>swing</b> extension. This thesis proposes a biologically inspired variable damping control strategy which can be simplified into a piecewise function with respect to the knee angle. The variable damping profile of the knee during swing extension has been modeled as an initial linear increase with respect to knee angle followed by a quadratic increase at the end of <b>swing.</b> A <b>damping</b> controller based on this proposed piecewise function has been implemented in a biomimetic, active, knee prosthesis (AAAKP) developed at MIT's Biomechatronics Lab. Preliminary studies on a unilateral, transfemoral amputee have shown that the AAAKP with the proposed damping control strategy is able to more closely emulate the damping profile of the unaffected leg, when compared to a conventional knee prosthesis (Otto Bock C-Leg®). This Initial study suggests that the proposed variable <b>damping</b> strategy for <b>swing</b> extension is able to more accurately emulate the joint mechanics of the unaffected knee.

40|$|Quadrotors {{are being}} used in an {{increasing}} number of applications. One such application is in carrying suspended payloads. However, as the payload swings [...] - due to quadrotor motion or due to a disturbance [...] - it also pulls on the quadrotor. The resulting force and torque from the payload can be significant and destabilize the quadrotor. Additionally, the swinging may be undesirable for fragile payloads, or the payload may collide with an obstacle. A typical approach is to allow the <b>swinging</b> to <b>damp</b> out, but this takes away from the limited battery life of the quadrotor. Instead, input shaping techniques can be implemented in the software to reduce the payload oscillations. Input shaping has been shown in similar systems (cranes, double pendula, and helicopters) to significantly reduce the amount of residual oscillation after a maneuver. Because it is a passive technique, the position of the payload {{does not need to be}} obtained in a motion capture facility or by using computationally expensive observer algorithms. This allows the quadrotor to be used in a variety of applications, including in disaster relief and cargo transport where cost is a factor. In this thesis, the dynamics of the quadrotor and payload are derived and explained in depth, including physicalparameters not usually considered. Then PID feedback is explored in controlling the system. In addition to the simulation results, hardware limitations must also be considered. Input shaping is then integrated into the system. The simulations show that input shaping greatly reduces unwanted residual oscillations. Finally, a folding quadrotor design is presented. Quadrotors must have large frames in order to carry large payloads, and a folding design saves space when transporting the quadrotor between flights. The quadrotor can then be placed in the trunk of a car or deployed from a rocket to reach an inaccessible area to provide aid. M. S...|$|R
40|$|New {{techniques}} {{being employed}} by Orion guidance, navigation, and control (GN&C) using a reaction control system (RCS) under parachutes are described. Pendulosity {{refers to a}} pendulum-oscillatory mode that can occur during descent under main parachutes {{and that has been}} observed during Orion parachute drop tests. The pendulum mode reduces the ability of GN&C to maneuver the suspended vehicle resulting in undesirable increases to structural loads at touch-down. Parachute redesign efforts have been unsuccessful in reducing the pendulous behavior necessitating GN&C mitigation options. An observer has been developed to estimate the pendulum motion as well as the underlying wind velocity vector. Using this knowledge the control system maneuvers the vehicle using two separate strategies determined by a wind velocity magnitude threshold; at high wind velocities the vehicle is aligned with the wind direction and for cases with lower wind velocities the vehicle is aligned such that it is perpendicular to the <b>swing</b> plane.

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of localizing inputs in swing dynamic models of large power system networks {{in the form of}} forced oscillations with unknown amplitude and frequency. Such harmonic oscillations commonly result from internal failures of control actuators in synchronous machines, and are particularly dangerous because their frequency often lies in the range of the inter-area oscillation modes of the system, resulting in unwanted sub-synchronous resonance phenomena. We first develop the concept of discrete nodal domains for second-order network dynamic systems, and relate these nodal domains to the residues of the system transfer function. There-after, we develop a graph-theoretic algorithm based on the magnitude as well as the sign of these residues that detects the location of the forced oscillation input. This algorithm extends our recent work in [1] for first-order consensus networks to second-order oscillatory networks, and shows that if the system has a clustered topology resulting in two-time-scale behavior in the phase oscillations then one can accurately localize the cluster in which the resonance is initiated using the residues of the inter-area modes. Our discussion includes both undamped and weakly <b>damped</b> <b>swing</b> models. We simulate a 60 -generator 4 -area power system to illustrate the different steps of our algorithm.

40|$|We {{overview}} recent theoretical {{studies of}} the dynamics of one- and two-dimensional spatial dissipative solitons in models based on the complex Ginzburg-Landau equations with the cubic-quintic combination of loss and gain terms, which include imaginary, real, or complex spatially periodic potentials. The imaginary potential represents periodic modulation of the local loss and gain. It is shown that the effective gradient force, induced by the inhomogeneous loss distribution, gives rise to three generic propagation scenarios for one-dimensional (1 D) dissipative solitons: transverse drift, persistent <b>swing</b> motion, and <b>damped</b> oscillations. When the lattice-average loss/gain value is zero, and the real potential has spatial parity opposite to that of the imaginary component, the respective complex potential is a realization of the parity-time symmetry. Under the action of lattice potentials of the latter type, 1 D solitons feature unique motion regimes in the form of transverse drift and persistent swing. In the 2 D geometry, three types of axisymmetric radial lattices are considered, viz., ones based solely on the refractive-index modulation, or solely on the linear-loss modulation, or on a combination of both. The rotary motion of solitons in such axisymmetric potentials can be effectively controlled by varying the strength of the initial tangential kick.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to use a solid state circuit breaker for the {{improvement}} of transient stability margin. Long distance AC transmission is often subject to stability problems, which limits the transmission capability. Interconnected power systems suffer from weakly <b>damped</b> <b>swings</b> between synchronous generator and sub systems. The development of modern power system has lead to an increasing complexity in the study of power system and also presents new challenges to power system stability and in particular to the aspects of transient stability and small signal stability. Transient stability control plays a significant role in ensuring the stable operation of power systems in the event of large disturbances and faults and is thus a significant area of research. This study investigates the improvement of transient stability of a two area system, using Solid State Circuit Breaker which is capable of fast switching in case of faults and thus controlling the real and reactive power flows in a faulted transmission line. Simulations are carried out in Matlab/Simulink environment for two area system model with Solid State Circuit Breaker to analyze the effects of SSCB on transient stability performance of the system. From the simulation results, swing curves of the three phase faulted power system without SSCB gets increases monotonically and thus the system can be considered as unstable whereas the swing curves of the system with an SSCB reaches to a steady state...|$|R
40|$|Slung load {{operation}} offers {{wide spectrum}} of scenarios, ranging from simple transport of bulky goods to rescue of people in mountains or from ships in distress. Some of the external loads are simple bluff bodies, others have an aerodynamically sensitive shape. The transport of external load requires intensive training and exercising of the pilots. The problem {{is the lack of}} appropriate cues and situation awareness if the load starts oscillating. Swinging helicopter external slung loads often lead to dangerous situations which not only can result in a total loss of the load itself but also can endanger the helicopter and its crew. Therefore, DLR and its partner iMAR have developed a Flight Director to assist the pilot during slung load transport. The flight director aims at providing the pilot with a convenient aid he intuitively can use to effectively damp the load pendulum motion and to allow manoeuvring without exciting oscillatory load modes. The development of a demonstrator system for the DLR BO 105 helicopter is outlined. Flight test results using a stable as well as a marginally stable load are shown. Based on the good experience gathered with the demonstrator system, a 2 nd generation flight director has been developed for the large cargo helicopter CH 53 G. The design and development of this improved flight director system is described in detail. In addition, corresponding flight test results are presented. The paper clearly shows the capability of the flight director to assist the pilot in <b>damping</b> <b>swinging</b> loads very quickly. In addition, it is shown, that the flight director is also capable in expanding the flight envelope for slung load transport. Pilots rated the flight director not only to reduce workload, but also to improve situation awareness. ...|$|R
