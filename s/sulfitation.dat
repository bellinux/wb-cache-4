2500|$|In industry, TNT is {{produced}} in a three-step process. First, toluene is nitrated {{with a mixture of}} sulfuric and nitric acid to produce mononitrotoluene (MNT). The MNT is separated and then renitrated to dinitrotoluene (DNT). In the final step, the DNT is nitrated to trinitrotoluene (TNT) using an anhydrous mixture of nitric acid and oleum. Nitric acid is consumed by the manufacturing process, but the diluted sulfuric acid can be reconcentrated and reused. [...] After nitration, TNT is stabilized by a process called <b>sulfitation,</b> where the crude TNT is treated with aqueous sodium sulfite solution to remove less stable isomers of TNT and other undesired reaction products. [...] The rinse water from sulphitation is known as red water and is a significant pollutant and waste product of TNT manufacture.|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{sugarcane}} {{enters the}} sugar mill and is processed {{along one of}} two product chains: the sugar chain (containing the originally conceived sugar reﬁnery and the alcohol plant) or the paper chain (containing the pulp and paper mills). Each downstream (internal) company uses the by-products from upstream companies as secondary material inputs. In addition, careful attention is given to reducing the residual waste and to its ultimate disposal. The sugar chain results in the ultimate production of sugar, alcohol, cement, and compound fertilizer (i.e., fertilizer with a speciﬁc ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium). In the sugar reﬁnery, the sugarcane “juice” that is released in the crushing and grinding assembly in the sugar mill is reﬁned in a carbonation process that yields a higher quality reﬁned sugar than does the <b>sulﬁtation</b> process {{that is used by}} the majority of cane sugar plants in China (Wei 2004). Wei notes that <b>sulﬁtation</b> is favored by the GG’s competitors, in part, because the ﬁlter mud (one of the wastes from the reﬁning process) from <b>sulﬁtation</b> can easily be disposed of as a direct application fertilizer. Filter mud from the carbonation process, on the other hand, can have a signiﬁcant negative effect on the local soil if it is applied directly to the land. The GG has addressed this problem by using the carbonation ﬁlter mud as an input to the State-owned cement production facility it manages, rather than as a fertilizer. The GG contributes the ﬁlter mud and pays for transportation costs, balancing the savings from not having to pay for disposal. The fuel for the cement plant is coal, introducing an added environmental burden on the symbiosis. The residues from the alcohol plant (molasses)—which once would have been released into the environment—are now used as input to the production of compound fertilizer, which goes back to the sugarcane ﬁelds, thus closing this loop. The paper chain is driven by the input of bagasse, which is the residue from the sugar mill, minus the pith; that is, the soft interior portion of the cane. Sixty percent of the bagasse has ﬁbers long enough for paper-making. The short ﬁbers of the pith are used as fuel in a cogeneration power plant. Earlier, the GG burnt the bagasse in its power plant and sold it to homeowners for cooking and heating. The pulping operation that prepares the bagasse for conversion into paper requires a signiﬁcant addition of alkali, which ends up in the residue of that operation. The GG has constructed an alkali recovery plant that recycles the waste from the pulping operation (black liquor), generating a white sludge that can be used as input to the cement mill, which is primarily a part of the sugar chain. The pulp is processed by one of the three paper mills, where a major waste (white liquor) is generated and subsequently treated to recover major portions of ﬁber and water, which are recycled to the paper mills.” ...|$|E
40|$|THERE is {{significant}} interest in many sugar producing countries towards producing a higher quality plantation white or direct consumption sugar with lower colour and lower residual sulfur dioxide levels. National standards for residual sulfur dioxide and colour have been lowered {{to reflect the}} growing demand for improved quality and concerns for health risks. Investigations at SRI have focused on identifling optimum conditions for clarification options to remove scale components, colour and other impurities by clarifying intermediate and final effect syrups. Trials in two Australian factories demonstrated the benefits for improved sugar quality and productivity improvements for the pan and centrifugal stages. Recent investigations in four overseas countries {{have focused on the}} application of sylup clarification with or without syrup <b>sulfitation</b> to achieve compliance with the changing standards. Results show that synlp clarification technology can be used to achieve lower sugar colours and reduced residual sulfur dioxide. In one case where syrup clarification was used in conjunction with syrup <b>sulfitation,</b> the colour of the product sugar was reduced from about 150 IU to below 100 IU. In another case, the colour of the sugar was reduced from 150 IU down to 120 IU by replacing the syrup <b>sulfitation</b> process with syrup clarification. In the latter case, residual sulfur dioxide values were reduced from about 25 ppm down to about 14 ppm. There are other advantages to be derived from clarification of the raw syrup, including reduced turbidity and lower ash. A reduction in viscosity has provided productivity gains for the pan and centrifugal stations...|$|E
40|$|Summary. Applicable for <b>sulfitation</b> {{equipment}} {{should provide}} {{a high degree of}} utilization of sulfur dioxide, which should allow to reduce the cost of production of sugar by reducing fuel sulfur and improve the ecological situation in the placement of a sugar factory. Currently used as standard equipment the liquid-jet sulfitator type A 2 -PSK and A 2 -PSM have disadvantages, the main ones are: unsatisfactory performance when the flow solution to be treated and released into the atmosphere from the combustion products nutritionally sulfur. Modernized standard liquid spray sulfitator to improve performance without significant cost, even if the treated liquid flow. A positive result with this work sulfitator achieved {{due to the fact that}} the mixing chamber is provided with a device for controlling the flow cross section of holes disc formed as it moves in the ring attached thereto with tapered fingers. Sulfitator is a cylindrical body provided with a sulfited separator for separating liquid and flue gas.

The form allows the fingers to create a flow of fluid through the disc hole, flowing at high speed and maintain a constant positive pressure to drive the liquid in the mixing chamber. When changing the amount of fluid supplied to the <b>sulfitation</b> ring having tapered fingers moves the fingers and alter the orifice holes, maintaining the pressure of the sugar solution prior to manufacturing the disk constant. This improves the contact of the liquid with the gas. The designed device can improve the efficiency of physical and chemical treatment of liquid intermediates of sugar production...|$|E

40|$|Sugar is a {{strategic}} commodity for Indonesia, {{such that the}} availibility and the price have been managed by the government. The national production of Indonesia sugar has not been {{enough to cover the}} consumption, such that the deficit must be imported. Indonesian sugar was produced by 61 factories, where 51 units are State-owned Company. Unfortunately, the quality of sugar produced by State – owned factory has been getting worse, such that some are not qualified to the Indonesian National Standards (SNI). One of the reasons is poor process technology adopted, which is mostly using <b>sulfitation</b> technology. The Government, therefore, encourages industry to migrate the process technology from sulfitationsystem to defecation remelt carbonatation (DRK) system. This study assesses the techno-economy feasibility of the migration.

40|$|We {{have been}} studied the {{mechanism}} of color reduction of sugarcane juice as a new innovative technology to crystal sugar production {{as a substitute for}} sulfur use, which was related to health problems. This work evaluated the effect of ozonation on sugarcane juice in two different conditions, heated and non-heated juice. The samples in both conditions were ozonized for 120 min in a stainless-steel batch reactor, connected to an ozonation system with constant flow (17. 3 mg O 3 /min). Ozonation did not change the values of reducing sugars (RS) and the apparent sucrose content (POL); however, the color rate ICUMSA showed significant decrease for the heated juice, but there was no response to ozonation in the non-heated juice. These responses represent a key point to the industry, which during the clarification process, heats the juice before the <b>sulfitation.</b> The settling should become more efficient after ozonation (results not shown), showing great potential to use this technology in production systems because of the optimization of reaction parameters for color reduction ICUMSA in sugarcane juice...|$|E

40|$|The use of SO 2 via the <b>sulfitation</b> {{process for}} the {{production}} of plantation white sugar is discouraged in many countries because of the health risks surrounding the consumption of contaminated sugar containing residual sulfur. Other current options based on the modification of crystallisation schemes are not effective to remove certain colourants that are relatively difficult to remove by sugar refiners. This work evaluated the degradation and decolouration of mixtures containing a synthetic glucose-glycine melanoidin and three hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs - caffeic, p-coumaric, and ferulic acids) present in sugar solutions, and sugar cane factory juices by the Fenton and modified Fenton processes. The modified Fenton process (containing Al(III)) degraded the melanoidin and the HCAs by 69 % and 53 % respectively, and resulted in 43 % decolourisation of the sugar solution. In the absence of Al(III), the Fenton process resulted in 63 % and 47 % degradation, but with only 24 % decolourisation. With factory juices, there were increases in colour measured at pH 4. 0 (≤ 45 %) and pH 7. 0 (≤ 21 %). However, there were decreases in colour at pH 9. 0 (≤ 42 %). Colour measured at pH 4. 0 suggests the presence of high molecular weight colourants, while colour at pH of 9. 0 is due the presence of natural colourants such as flavonoids and phenolics. A higher proportion of the colour measured at pH 9. 0 is more than likely to be transferred to the sugar crystal than the other colour species, and so a reduction in its proportion in the crystallising solution may reduce raw sugar colour...|$|E
40|$|Les marcs de raisin issus de la {{viniculture}} constituent un gisement de ressource naturelle abondant, sous valorisé et riche en polyphénols. Une méthode d?extraction de ces tannins condensés a été développée et optimisée en vue d'une application en adhésif pour les produits dérivés du bois. Les tannins ont été caractérisés par Résonance Magnétique Nucléaire, spectroscopie Infra Rouge (FTIR), spectrométrie de masse (MALDI TOF) et Analyse Thermomécanique (TMA). Des panneaux de particules ont été fabriqués à l'aide des colles élaborées en laboratoire et testés suivant les normes françaises en vigueur, plusieurs dépassent largement les valeurs seuilsThe {{extraction of}} condensed tannins from grape pomace was examined using water medium {{in the presence}} of different bases as catalyst (NaOH, Na 2 CO 3, NaHCO 3 and Na 2 SO 3). Two different extraction processes and the influence of 4 parameters (i. e., temperature, reaction time, chemical reagents and concentration of the chemical reagents) on the tannin extracts yields and properties were studied. The tannin fractions were characterized by Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13 C-NMR) and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). It was demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} extract reactive tannins from grape pomace in basic medium. The tannin extracts obtained by precipitation in acidic conditions display a high phenolic content (Stiasny number higher 95 %) but low water solubility and low reactivity toward formaldehyde because of the formation of catechinic acid phlobatannins during the acidification step. The tannins extracts obtained by lyophilization of the liquid, despite of their lower phenolic contents, displayed promising properties for adhesive applications. The optimum temperature of the extraction process was 100 °C, reaction time was 120 min; the best concentration of reagent was 10 % (w/w). It was also shown that addition of sulphite ions during the extraction step improved the process :y the introduction of a sulfonic group through <b>sulfitation</b> increased both tannin solubility and reactivity as a result from the opening of the heterocyclic ring during extraction The structure of grape pomace sulfited tannin extracts did not present noticeable discrepancy exception of the ratio of the opening pyran ring which was different as a function of the catalyst used. The opening of pyran ring during the tannins extraction seem to be more important by using Na 2 CO 3 and NaHCO 3 than when using NaOH. The FT-IR bands assigned to aromatic ring vibration and carbonyl groups were stronger and no bands attributed to sulfited groups were tested detected in acidified tannins compared to lyophilized tannins. The TG 2 results showed that the weight lost of these tannin extracts mainly composed of two steps. The first step starts from room temperature to 200 °C. It is attributed to the mass lost of water and some easy-degraded small low molecules. The secondly steps which is the mainly degradation step of tannin extract samples from 200 to 400 °C. The results from 13 C-NMR showed that condensed tannin extracts from grape pomace were consistent with dominant procyanidin units with a minor amount of prodelphinidin units that are linked together by a C 4 -C 8 bond. Relatively low carbonhydrate and high catechinc acid content was observed in acidified tannins compared to lyophilized tannins. It was shown by MADI-TOF experiments that grape pomace tannin extracts are mainly composed of flavoinoid oligomers up to 6 repeating units in lyophilized tannins and 10 repeating units in acidified tannins respectively, with dominant procyanidin units. A small proportion of substitution with glucose and gallic acid was detected in procyanidin units of polyflavonoid oligomers. The degree of polymerization of acidified tannins is higher than lyophilized tannins. Two different formulations (nonfortified tannin adhesive and fortified with addition of 20 % of polymeric 4, 4 '-diphenyl methane diisocyanate (p-MDI)) were used to press one layer wood particle board. It was shown that the nature of the extraction reagent (NaOH, Na 2 CO 3 or NaHCO 3) greatly impacts the properties of the resins and the mechanical properties of the panel internal bonding strengths. The particleboards bonded by the tannins extracted using Na 2 CO 3 as catalyst give the best performance and were good enough to pass relevant international standard specifications for interior grade panels. Formaldehyde emission of these panels was below the European Norm requirements (<= 6. 5 mg/ 100 g panel...|$|E
