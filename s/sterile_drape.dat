50|$|Patients {{will have}} to remove their {{clothing}} covering {{the lower part of}} the body, although some physicians may prefer if the patient wears a hospital gown for the examination and covers {{the lower part of the}} body with a <b>sterile</b> <b>drape.</b> In most cases, patients lie on their backs with their knees slightly parted. Occasionally, a patient may also need to have their knees raised. This is particularly when undergoing a Rigid Cystoscopy examination. For flexible cystoscopy procedures the patient is almost always alert and a local anesthetic is applied to reduce discomfort. In cases requiring a rigid cystoscopy it is not unusual for the patient to be given a general anesthetic, as these can be more uncomfortable, particularly for men. A physician, nurse or technician will clean the area around the urethral opening and apply a local anesthetic. The local anesthetic is applied direct from a tube or needleless syringe into the urinary tract. Often, skin preparation is performed with chlorhexidine.|$|E

Background. “Lead hands ” are frequently used to maintain hand and finger position in hand surgery. The malleability and strength of lead make it ideal for this purpose. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the amount of lead transferred to a surgeon’s glove during handling of a lead hand. Method. Sterile surgical gloves were wiped over the surface of a lead hand. The number of wipes was varied, the gloves were then sent to a trace elements laboratory, and the lead content transferred to each glove was determined. Results. The amount of lead transferred to each glove increased with increasing exposure to the lead hand. After twenty wipes, up to 2 mg of lead was transferred to the surgeon’s glove. Covering the lead hand with a <b>sterile</b> <b>drape</b> markedly reduced the lead transferred to the surgeon’s glove. Conclusion. Significant amount of lead is transferred on to the gloves after handling a lead hand. This risks wound contamination and a foreign body reaction.

40|$|BACKGROUND: These {{guidelines}} {{apply to}} all rodent survival surgical procedures performed at Johns Hopkins University 1. Survival surgery on rodents must be performed using sterile techniques to minimize microbial contamination of exposed tissues. Minor surgical procedures such as wound suturing and peripheral vessel cannulation should be performed in accordance with standard veterinary practices 1. Pre-Operative: 1. A dedicated surgical facility is not required for rodents. 2. Surgery should be conducted in a disinfected and uncluttered area. Access to the area by personnel not {{directly involved in the}} surgery must be limited when surgery is being performed. 3. Apply sterile non-medicated ophthalmic ointment to eyes to prevent corneal drying. 4. Administer sterile isotonic fluids as indicated to replace losses. 5. Remove hair from the surgical site(s), in a separate location from where the surgery is conducted. 6. Prepare the surgical site(s) with an appropriate skin disinfectant. 7. Use a <b>sterile</b> <b>drape</b> to lay out instruments 8. Surgeons mustc wear a clean laboratory garment, a facemask, head cap/hat, and wash and dry their hands before donning sterile gloves. If working in a laminar flow hood a facemask and head cap/hat are not necessary. 9. Assistants working in the immediate vicinity mustc wear a clean garment, head cap/hat, facemask and gloves. Intra-Operative: 1. The animal(s) must be maintained in a surgical plane of anesthesia throughout the procedure. 2. Begin surgery with sterile instruments and handle them aseptically. 3. Instruments and gloves may be used for a series of similar surgeries provided they are maintained clean and disinfected between animals. 4. Lay instruments on a <b>sterile</b> <b>drape</b> in between use. 5. Monitor and/or maintain the animal's vital signs. 6. Handle tissue gently and prevent tissue from drying...|$|E

Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used which included a semi-structured interview with the ICU manager and an audit of current nebuliser practice. Nebulisers that were identified in the interview were swabbed and streaked on blood agar plates (BAPs). BAPs were incubated and assessed for bacterial colonisation, number of colony forming units (CFUs) and number of different species of CFUs present. Results: Two hundred and sixty-nine ICU beds were surveyed over a two-month period resulting in 45 nebulisers used within a ventilator circuit that could be tested. The majority (93 %) were single-use jet nebulisers, all were being re-used and 52 % presented with contamination. None of the ICUs had a nebuliser decontamination protocol in place. Contaminated nebulisers that were stored in a <b>sterile</b> <b>drape</b> had significantly higher concentrations of bacterial growth (p= 0. 03).

40|$|SummaryCentral line-associated {{bloodstream}} infection (CLABSIs) {{is an important}} healthcare-associated infection in the critical care units. It causes substantial morbidity, mortality and incurs high costs. The use of central venous line (CVL) insertion bundle {{has been shown to}} decrease the incidence of CLABSIs. Our aim was to study the impact of CVL insertion bundle on incidence of CLABSI and study the causative microbial agents in an intensive care unit in Kuwait. Surveillance for CLABSI was conducted by trained infection control team using National Health Safety Network (NHSN) case definitions and device days measurement methods. During the intervention period, nursing staff used central line care bundle consisting of (1) hand hygiene by inserter (2) maximal barrier precautions upon insertion by the physician inserting the catheter and <b>sterile</b> <b>drape</b> from head to toe to the patient (3) use of a 2 % chlorohexidine gluconate (CHG) in 70 % ethanol scrub for the insertion site (4) optimum catheter site selection. (5) Examination of the daily necessity of the central line. During the pre-intervention period, there were 5367 documented catheter-days and 80 CLABSIs, for an incidence density of 14. 9 CLABSIs per 1000 catheter-days. After implementation of the interventions, there were 5052 catheter-days and 56 CLABSIs, for an incidence density of 11. 08 per 1000 catheter-days. The reduction in the CLABSI/ 1000 catheter days was not statistically significant (P= 0. 0859).

40|$|Background High {{rates of}} {{heterotopic}} ossification {{have been associated}} with hip resurfacing as compared to THA. Bone debris from femoral head reamings is cited as one of the risk factors linked to increased rates of heterotopic ossification. Questions/purposes We therefore asked whether (1) the incidence of heterotopic ossification differed with and without the use of a plastic drape used to collect bone debris and (2) any of a number of variables (age, gender, diagnosis, previous hip surgery, operative time, and blood loss) related to the occurrence of HO. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 136 hip resurfac-ings performed using one of two techniques: Group 1 contained 64 hip resurfacings performed using a <b>sterile</b> <b>drape</b> around the femoral neck while reaming the femoral head to collect bone debris; Group 2 contained 72 hip resurfacings carried out with manually removing bone debris and utilizing a pulse lavage. Data were collected with respect to diagnosis, gender, previous surgery, post-operative complications, operative time, and blood loss to rule out confounding variables. The amount of heterotopic ossification was measured radiographically in hips after undergoing resurfacing arthroplasty. The minimum fol-lowup was 6 months (mean, 15 months; range, 6 – 27 months). Results No patient had heterotopic ossification of clinical importance and none had resection of the heterotopic ossification. Group 1 had a lower overall incidence of minor heterotopic ossification (32 %) than Group 2 (58 %). Risk factors linked to heterotopic ossification include male gender and operative time. Conclusions The use of a plastic drape to collect bone debris from femoral head reamings decreased the incidence of heterotopic ossification in resurfacing arthroplasty of the hip.

40|$|Total {{parenteral}} nutrition (TPN) is standard practice for preterm babies in modern {{neonatal intensive care}} units. Although more difficult to site, peripherally inserted percutaneous central venous catheters {{need to be replaced}} less frequently than peripheral cannulae and therefore have been shown to reduce interruptions in nutrition. The guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on prevention of infection related to peripherally inserted percutaneous central venous catheters recommends the use of "maximal sterile barrier precautions" (use of cap, mask, sterile gown, sterile gloves and large <b>sterile</b> <b>drape)</b> for the insertion of the line, but it acknowledges that the efficacy of these recommendations has not been studied. Furthermore, the guidelines do not stipulate if sterile barrier precautions should also be applied during subsequent changing of bags of {{parenteral nutrition}}. We observed an increase in the incidence of bacteraemia in premature babies from January to April 2006 in our neonatal intensive care unit in North Queensland, Australia. An infection control guideline was introduced on May 2006 in which TPN bags were changed every 48 h, with the use of maximal sterile barrier precautions. This practice was, however, expensive and time consuming. Retrospectively, we investigated the effect of the new infection control technique in reducing the bacteraemia rate. The study period was divided into two 12 -month epochs, before and after implementation of the changes. Any premature baby admitted during the study period who received TPN via a peripheral long line was included in the study. Blood culture results at birth and before the insertion of the long line were excluded from analysis. Analysis revealed that the percentage of babies receiving TPN who subsequently developed bacteraemia was higher in the pre-intervention group than in the post-intervention group (odds ratio (OR) 2. 13; 95 % CI 0. 93 to 4. 90). Mortality was 9. 4 % in the pre-intervention group compared with 2. 6 % in the post-intervention group (OR 3. 67; 95 % CI 0. 93 to 20. 9). Multivariate logistic regression showed that bacteraemia was associated with gestation (OR 0. 65; 95 % CI 0. 44 to 0. 97) and TPN use (OR 4. 17; 95 % CI 1. 37 to 12. 7) in the pre-intervention group. We concluded that the new regimen reduced bacteraemia and mortality, although the study was not a randomised and controlled trial and could not account for unmeasured or unknown confounder...|$|E

50|$|Proper {{anesthesia}} {{is essential}} for ocular surgery. Topical anesthesia is most commonly employed, typically by the instillation of a local anesthetic such as tetracaine or lidocaine. Alternatively, lidocaine and/or longer-acting bupivacaine anesthestic may be injected into the area surrounding (peribulbar block) or behind (retrobulbar block) the eye muscle cone to more fully immobilize the extraocular muscles and minimize pain sensation. A facial nerve block using lidocaine and bupivacaine may occasionally be performed to reduce lid squeezing. General anesthesia is recommended for children, traumatic eye injuries with cataract, for very apprehensive or uncooperative patients and animals. Cardiovascular monitoring is preferable in local anesthesia and is mandatory {{in the setting of}} general anesthesia. Proper sterile precautions are taken to prepare the area for surgery, including use of antiseptics like povidone-iodine. <b>Sterile</b> <b>drapes,</b> gowns and gloves are employed.

However, as its size and weight increase, pannus handling during surgery becomes a real challenge for the surgeon and his/her assistants. We describe a case where we use a novel method of pannus suspension, the Spider Tenet, a limb positioner for orthopedic procedures. This device allows a stable pannus suspension throughout the procedure to facilitate incision planning, skin preparation, and retraction, as well as to increase exposure, thereby facilitating the identification and ligation of large blood vessels during dissection.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{correction}} of trunk deformity {{is crucial in}} scoliosis surgery, especially for the patient's self-image. However, direct visualization of external scoliotic trunk deformity during surgical correction is difficult due to the covering draping sheets. Methods An optoelectronic camera system with 10 passive markers is used to track the trunk geometry of 5 scoliotic patients during corrective surgery. The position of 10 anatomical landmarks and 5 trunk indices computed from {{the position of the}} passive markers are compared during and after instrumentation of the spine. Results Internal validation of the accuracy of tracking was evaluated at 0. 41 +/- 0. 05 mm RMS. Intra operative tracking during surgical maneuvers shows improvement of the shoulder balance during and after {{correction of}} the spine. Improvement of the overall patient balance is observed. At last, a minor increase of the spinal length can be noticed. Conclusion Tracking of the external geometry of the trunk during surgical correction is useful to monitor changes occurring under the <b>sterile</b> <b>draping</b> sheets. Moreover, this technique can used be used to reach the optimal configuration on the operating frame before proceeding to surgery. The current tracking technique was able to detect significant changes in trunk geometry caused by posterior instrumentation of the spine despite significant correction of the spinal curvature. It could therefore become relevant for computer-assisted guidance of surgical maneuvers when performing posterior instrumentation of the scoliotic spine, provide important insights during positioning of patients. </p...|$|R
