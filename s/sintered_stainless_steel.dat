Design/methodology/approach: High power diode laser (HPDL) was applied to surface modification of <b>sintered</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> with Si 3 N 4 powder. The influence of laser alloying conditions on the width, penetration depth of alloyed surface layer were studied and analysed via FEM simulation. The microstructure of alloyed layers was examined using light and scanning electron microscopy as well as X-ray diffraction. The microhardness and wear resistance of studied surface layers were also evaluated.

The strong austenite stabilizer effect of nitrogen was observed in ferritic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> that revealed duplex microstructure. The hardness increased with addition of Si 3 N 4 due to strong solution hardening effect of nitrogen and silicon dissolved in the steel matrix during laser alloying. The hardening effect of Si 3 N 4 was strongest in case of ferritic <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> where microhardness increased to 450 HV 0. 1 for 2. 1 kW of laser beam power. The duplex <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> shows the regular microhardness on the whole penetration depth.

This test report details the results of experimental activities related only to filter scale-up characterization. These tests were performed under the Simulant Testing Program supporting Phase 1 of the demonstration of the pretreatment leaching processes at PEP. Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) conducted the tests discussed herein for Bechtel National, Inc. (BNI) to address the data needs of Test Specification 24590 -WTP-TSP-RT- 07 - 004. Scale-up characterization tests employ high-level waste (HLW) simulants developed under the Test Plan TP-RPP-WTP- 469. The experimental activities outlined in TP-RPP-WTP- 509 examined specific processes from two broad areas of simulant behavior: 1) leaching performance of the boehmite simulant {{as a function of}} suspending phase chemistry and 2) filtration performance of the blended simulant with respect to filter scale-up and fouling. With regard to leaching behavior, the effect of anions on the kinetics of boehmite leaching was examined. Two experiments were conducted: 1) one examined the effect of the aluminate anion on the rate of boehmite dissolution and 2) another determined the effect of secondary anions typical of Hanford tank wastes on the rate of boehmite dissolution. Both experiments provide insight into how compositional variations in the suspending phase impact the effectiveness of the leaching processes. In addition, the aluminate anion studies provide information on the consequences of gibbsite in waste. The latter derives from the expected fast dissolution of gibbsite relative to boehmite. This test report concerns only results of the filtration performance with respect to scale-up. Test results for boehmite dissolution kinetics and filter fouling are reported elsewhere (see Table S. 1). The primary goal of scale-up testing was to examine how filter length influenced permeate flux rates. To accomplish this, the existing cells unit filter system, which employs a 2 -ft-long, 0. 5 -in. (inner) diameter <b>sintered</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> filter element, was redesigned to accommodate an 8 -ft. <b>sintered</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> filter element of the same diameter. Testing was then performed to evaluate the filtration performance of waste simulant slurries. Scale-up testing consisted of two separate series of filtration tests: 1) scale-up axial velocity (AV) /transmembrane pressure (TMP) matrix tests and 2) scale-up temperature tests. The AV/TMP matrix tests examined filtration performance of two different waste simulant slurries in the 8 -ft. cells unit filter system. Waste simulant slurry formulations for the 8 -ft. scale-up test was selected to match simulant slurries for which filtration performance had been characterized on the 2 -ft CUF. For the scale-up temperature tests, the filtration performance at three test temperatures (i. e., 25 °C, 40 °C, and 60 °C) was determined to evaluate if filter flux versus temperature correlations developed using the 2 -ft filters were also valid for the 8 -ft filters...|$|E
40|$|In 2008, the Savannah River Site (SRS) began {{treatment}} of liquid radioactive waste from its Tank Farms. To treat waste streams containing {sup 137 }Cs, {sup 90 }Sr, and actinides, SRS developed the Actinide Removal Process (ARP) and the Modular Caustic Side Solvent Extraction Unit (MCU). The Actinide Removal Process contacts the waste with monosodium titanate (MST) to sorb strontium and select actinides. After MST contact, the process filters the resulting slurry {{to remove the}} MST (with sorbed strontium and actinides) and any entrained sludge. The filtrate is transported to the MCU to remove cesium. The solid particle removed by the filter are concentrated to {approx} 5 wt %, washed to reduce the concentration of dissolved sodium, and transported to the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) for vitrification. The authors conducted tests with 0. 5 {micro} and 0. 1 {micro} Mott <b>sintered</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> crossflow filter at bench-scale (0. 19 ft{sup 2 } surface area) and pilot-scale (11. 2 ft{sup 2 }). The collected data supported design of the filter for the process and identified preferred operating conditions for the full-scale process (230 ft{sup 2 }). The testing investigated the influence of operating parameters, such as filter pore size, axial velocity, transmembrane pressure, and solids loading, on filter flux, and validated the simulant used for pilot-scale testing. The conclusions from this work follow: (1) The 0. 1 {micro} Mott <b>sintered</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> filter produced higher flux than the 0. 5 {micro} filter. (2) The filtrate samples collected showed no visible solids. (3) The filter flux with actual waste {{is comparable to the}} filter flux with simulated waste, with the simulated waste being conservative. This result shows the simulated sludge is representative of the actual sludge. (4) When the data is adjusted for differences in transmembrane pressure, the filter flux in the Actinide Removal Process is comparable to the filter flux in the bench-scale and pilot-scale testing. (5) Filter flux increased with transmembrane pressure, increased with axial velocity, and decreased with concentration in agreement with classical crossflow filtration theories...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} was to {{describe}} <b>sintered</b> duplex <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> manufactured in sinter-hardening process and its usability in field of <b>stainless</b> <b>steels.</b> Design/methodology/approach: In presented study duplex <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> were obtained through powder metallurgy starting from austenitic, ferritic base powders by controlled addition of alloying elements, such as Cr, Ni, Mo and Cu. In the studies apart from the preparation of mixes, Schaeffler’s diagram was taken into consideration. Prepared mixes have been compacted at 800 MPa and sintered in a vacuum furnace with argon backfilling at temperatures from 1200 °C to 1285 °C for 0. 5, 1 and 2 h. After sintering different cooling cycles were applied using nitrogen under pressure from 0. 6 MPa to 0. 002 MPa in argon atmosphere. Produced duplex <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> have been studied by scanning and optical microscopy and EDS chemical analysis of microstructure components. Findings: Obtained microstructure and mechanical properties of <b>sintered</b> duplex <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> strictly depend on the density and the pore morphology present in the microstructure and especially on cooling rate directly from sintering temperature in sinter-hardening process. The lowest cooling rate - applied gas pressure, the mechanical properties and corrosion resistance decrease due to precipitation of sigma phase. Proper bi-physic microstructure was obtained using nitrogen under pressure of 0. 6 and 0. 2 MPa. Research limitations/implications: Applied fast cooling rate seems to be a good compromise for mechanical properties and obtained microstructures, nevertheless further tests should be carried out in order to examine its influence on corrosion properties. Originality/value: The utilization of sinter-hardening process combined with use of elemental powders added to a <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> base powder shows its potentialities in terms of good microstructural homogeneity and especially working with cycles possible to introduce in industrial practice...|$|R
40|$|<b>Stainless</b> <b>steel</b> powders (303 L, 304 L, 310 L and 316 L) {{were formed}} into tensile test bars using the “press and sinter” process. Most {{processing}} parameters, except heating rate, were kept constant. During the heating {{of the experimental}} speci-mens from 700 °C to the sintering temperature of 1300 °C, heating rates were varied, e. g., 2. 5, 5. 0, and 10. 0 °C/min. Experimental results showed that a material heated with a low heating rate tended to have higher sintered density and tensile strength. However, the low heating rate caused grain growth in the sintered material. These results are in contradiction with the improved densification of some ceramics by ultra rapid heating. The reasons for contradiction are as follows. First, the heat-ing rates employed in this work are not very different. The second is attributed to small thermal gradients generated in the thin metal powder compacts. Because of these reasons, densification of the <b>sintered</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steels</b> series 300 is controlled by an isothermal condition. The low heating rate allows longer time for atomic diffusion, which is an important sintering factor. This means more atoms move to points of contact between powder particles to form necking and to cause necking growth. This results in better sintering. However, the low heating rate means that the materials are exposed to heat for longer time and thus their grains {{have a tendency to}} grow...|$|R
