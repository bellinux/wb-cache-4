The book had been effectively designed for not spoiling the figure when carried in a pocket. But this did not matter, for even if he could have read the words, he would not have known what they meant, seeing that he was thinking how he could make a certain petition to a certain person sitting just behind at a large bureau with a <b>sliding</b> <b>top,</b> examining artificial flies.|$|E
50|$|The V70 uses {{a slider}} form factor, where the user can push on a plastic bar located under {{the screen in}} order to open the <b>sliding</b> <b>top</b> portion of the phone. When opened, the top portion slides upwards, {{revealing}} the standard bell keypad (including numeric, star, and pound keys). These keys are covered when the phone is closed, but the remaining keys, including the side keys, can be used normally once the keypad is unlocked; such keys are automatically locked after the device is closed to prevent accidental activation when in a purse or pocket.|$|E
40|$|The perturbing {{effect of}} a general system of forces is {{calculated}} for a roiling and for a <b>sliding</b> <b>top,</b> and it is shown that certain components {{by virtue of their}} dependence upon the spin will be principally effective in erecting the top. For a <b>sliding</b> <b>top</b> the principal component is the sliding friction, and for a rolling top a couple at the point of contact opposing rolling. Experimental results on tops are analysed and it is shown, in accordance with a conjecture of Fokker, that a normal top does remain effectively in the rolling configuration but the motion is not in general one of pure rolling, since periodic sliding oscillations occur which profoundly modify the motion. The rate of rise in pure rolling gives a value of the rolling couple of the order of 3, 000 dyne cms. Introduction. The problem of the rising of a top with a rounded peg is an old one. The first explanation of the rise as due to slipping seems to be that of Smith 1), and has been considered by J ellet t 2), Rout h 3) and by Gallop 4), who considers the energy transfer involved and deduces a minimum energy condition for complete erection.

40|$|A full multigrid/full {{approximation}} storage (FMG/FAS) {{algorithm is}} utilized {{to solve the}} incompressible recirculating flow problems in complex geometrics. The algorithm is implemented {{in conjunction with a}} pressure-correction/staggered-grid type of technique using curvilinear coordinates. In order to illustrate the performance of the method, two flow configurations-one a square cavity driven by a <b>sliding</b> <b>top</b> wall and the other a channel with multiple bumps-are used as test problems. Comparisons are made between the performances of the multigrid (MG) and single-grid methods, measured by the number of fine grid iterations, equivalent work units and CPU time. Besides demonstrating that the MG method can yield substantial speed-up with wide variations in Re, grid distributions and geometry, issues such as the convergence characteristics at different grid levels, the choice of convection schemes and the effectiveness of the basic iterative smoothers are studied. An adaptive grid scheme is also combined with the MG procedure to explore the effects of grid resolution on the MG convergence rate as well as the numerical accuracy. Â© 1993...|$|E
