5|$|After {{capturing}} the crater, Cherry pushed {{on through the}} village, where his party emerged from among the buildings on the far side. Another stiff fight ensured {{with a group of}} Germans in dug-outs {{by the side of the}} road, before the company was able to meet up with its fellow units which had bypassed the village and were already established to the north and east of the area. Cherry's orders were to fall back into reserve, but he disregarded them as he <b>sensed</b> <b>a</b> counter-attack was forthcoming. At 09:00 on 27 March, the Germans launched a very strong counter-attack under heavy artillery fire. At one point, Cherry noticed that the Germans were firing yellow flares to pinpoint Australian positions to their gunners. He found some of these flares, and fired them away from his position. The German attempts to retake Lagnicourt—at a cost to the 7th Brigade of 377 casualties—raged all day before they abandoned the counterattack.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Britten-Norman {{was formed}} {{for the purpose}} of {{converting}} and operating agricultural aircraft, amongst other vehicles such as the Cushioncraft hovercraft. In 1963, the firm initiated development work upon what would become the Islander, having <b>sensed</b> <b>a</b> demand for a single and inexpensive twin-piston engine aircraft. The founders, John Britten and Desmond Norman, had observed the rapid growth of the commuter airline sector, and concluded that capacity was of a higher value to these operators than either range or cruising speed, thus the Islander emphasized payload over either of these attributes.|$|E
25|$|The Buckeyes {{had high}} {{expectations}} again entering the 1996 contest. They boasted an unblemished 10–0 record and were ranked #2 {{in the nation}} {{as they entered the}} finale with 7–3 Michigan. When Ohio State jumped to a 9–0 halftime lead, the OSU crowd <b>sensed</b> <b>a</b> special finish and perhaps a rise to #1. The Wolverines' defense shut the Buckeyes out in the second half while Brian Griese replaced the struggling Scott Dreisbach and led Michigan to 13 unanswered points and another victory over their rivals, 13–9. The game {{would turn out to be}} the Buckeyes' only loss of the season and ended up costing them a chance of the national championship.|$|E

25|$|Storm {{has been}} shown to be {{sensitive}} to the dynamics of the natural world, and her psionic powers over weather are affected by her emotions. One consequence of this connection to nature is that she often suppresses extreme feelings to prevent her emotional state from resulting in violent weather. She has once <b>sensed</b> <b>a</b> diseased and dying tree on the X-Mansion grounds, detected objects within various atmospheric mediums—including water, and sensed the incorrect motion of a hurricane in the Northern Hemisphere and the gravitational stress on the tides by the Moon and Sun as well as the distortion of a planet's magnetosphere. Storm can view the Earth as weather patterns, and is able to precisely recognize her geographic position through interpretations of these patterns. Storm's mutant abilities are limited by her willpower and the strength of her body. Sentinels have considered Storm an Omega-level mutant on one occasion.|$|E

500|$|Jameson sent {{a column}} of {{soldiers}} under Major Patrick Forbes to locate and capture Lobengula. The column camped on the south bank of the Shangani River about [...] north-east of the village of Lupane {{on the evening of}} December 3, 1893. The next day, late in the afternoon, a dozen men under the command of Major Wilson were sent across the river to patrol the area. The Wilson Patrol came across a group of Matabele women and children who claimed to know Lobengula's whereabouts. Burnham, who served as the lead scout of the Wilson Patrol, <b>sensed</b> <b>a</b> trap and advised Wilson to withdraw, but Wilson ordered his patrol to advance.|$|E

500|$|At {{this point}} The Five {{as a unit}} was dispersing. Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov wanted to remove {{themselves}} from Balakirev's influence, which they now found stifling, and go in their individual directions as composers. Balakirev might have <b>sensed</b> <b>a</b> potential new disciple in Tchaikovsky. He explained in his reply from Saint Petersburg that while he preferred to give his opinions in person and at length to press his points home, he was couching his reply [...] "with complete frankness", adding, with a deft touch of flattery, that he felt that Tchaikovsky was [...] "a fully fledged artist" [...] and that {{he looked forward to}} discussing the piece with him on an upcoming trip to Moscow.|$|E
500|$|Wilberforce's {{involvement}} in the abolition movement was motivated {{by a desire to}} put his Christian principles into action and to serve God in public life. He and other Evangelicals were horrified by what they perceived was a depraved and unChristian trade, and the greed and avarice of the owners and traders. Wilberforce <b>sensed</b> <b>a</b> call from God, writing in a journal entry in 1787 that [...] "God Almighty has set before me two great objects, the suppression of the Slave Trade and the Reformation of Manners [...] ". The conspicuous involvement of Evangelicals in the highly popular anti-slavery movement served to improve the status of a group otherwise associated with the less popular campaigns against vice and immorality.|$|E
500|$|Manga creator Katsura Hoshino {{said that}} she did not know how Allen originated, since she likes her main {{characters}} to be rambunctious, rude idiots. She said that the general idea for his design was an [...] "energetic youth with messy fly-a-way hair and other things like that", but when he was drawn with the uniform of the Black Order (the group Allen joins in the series) she <b>sensed</b> <b>a</b> [...] "lack of coordination". Hoshino felt that a more-mature design would be better; although she believed his final design looked best with the Black Order uniform, she wondered if it should be more masculine. Because he is an Exorcist, she wanted him to have a [...] "very scary-looking image" [...] and added the scar on his left forehead; the scar changed shape several times before becoming a pentagram. Since Hoshino wanted the Order and its enemies to have visual contrast, she gave Allen and the Exorcists black cloaks to convey a [...] "gloomy" [...] impression. Allen's clothing is drawn from Hoshino's general impression of the late nineteenth century, and his ribbon tie and other accessories are intended to project a [...] "gentlemanly image".|$|E

500|$|Among the prisoners, Seaman First Class Joseph Randolph [...] "Joe" [...] Small, a winch {{operator}} in Division Four and a natural leader who called cadence when his division marched, {{was asked by}} officers to assemble a handful of reliable men as a team of acting petty officers {{and to keep the}} other prisoners on good behavior. On August 10, there had been conflicts between the prisoners and their guards as the prisoners were marched to the mess hall for meals. There was also a brief fight in the mess hall, and some prisoners were seen sharpening spoons into makeshift knives. Small <b>sensed</b> <b>a</b> general air of rebelliousness among the prisoners. To counteract the rising tension and offset the disaster he saw coming, Small convened a short meeting that evening aboard the crowded barge and told the prisoners to [...] "knock off the horseplay", stay out of trouble and obey the shore patrol guards (who were black) and the officers, because the alternative (white Marines as guards) would be worse. He said to the men, [...] "We've got the officers by the ballsthey can do nothing to us if we don't do anything to them. If we stick together, they can't do anything to us." ...|$|E

The album stayed on the chart for twenty-nine weeks, but failed to yield any charting singles, despite four releases. Unlike its predecessor which won numerous awards, Prinsessor, was met with mixed reviews from Swedish critics, who saw the album as far too sprawling and <b>sensed</b> <b>a</b> loss of her [...] "uniqueness".|$|E

On their next drive, he completed four passes, the last a 45-yard touchdown bomb to Taylor on the second play of the fourth quarter, increasing Washington's lead to 17–3. [...] The Redskins then dominated the rest of the game, scoring with field goals from Knight on each of their next three drives to make the final score 26–3.|$|E
2500|$|Știrbei was {{reconfirmed}} {{as deputy}} for Dolj and Craiova in the December 1867 election, this time without controversy. The Domnitor, who found {{him to be}} a competent diplomat, also considered him for his Prime Minister. The latter proposal, endorsed by the French, was vetoed by Karl Anton of Hohenzollern, who feared that Știrbei had not renounced his bid for the throne. Reportedly, this greatly disappointed the candidate, contributing to his decision to quit politics and the country altogether—although, according to other accounts, he cited reasons of health. As noted in 1880 by a friend, the art historian Ernest Chesneau, Știrbei <b>sensed</b> <b>a</b> need for [...] "independence".|$|E
2500|$|The ballet was premiered by the Ballets Russes in Paris on 25 June 1910, {{conducted}} by Gabriel Pierné. Even {{before the first}} performance, the company <b>sensed</b> <b>a</b> huge success in the making, and every performance of the ballet in that first production, as Karsavina recalled, met a [...] "crescendo" [...] of success. The critics were ecstatic, praising the ballet for {{what they saw as}} an ideal symbiosis between decor, choreography and music: [...] "The old-gold vermiculation of the fantastic back-cloth seems to have been invented to a formula identical with that of the shimmering web of the orchestra" [...] enthused Henri Ghéon in Nouvelle revue française (1910). The scenery was designed by Alexander Golovine and the costumes by Léon Bakst.|$|E

2500|$|Years later, in his autobiography, Brando remarked: [...] "Tony Quinn, whom I admired professionally {{and liked}} personally, played my brother, {{but he was}} {{extremely}} cold to me while we shot that picture. During our scenes together, I <b>sensed</b> <b>a</b> bitterness toward me, and if I suggested a drink after work, he either turned me down or else was sullen and said little. Only years later did I learn why." [...] Brando related that, to create on-screen tension between the two, [...] "Gadg" [...] (Kazan) had told Quinn—who {{had taken over the}} role of Stanley Kowalski on Broadway after Brando had finished—that Brando had been unimpressed with his work. After achieving the desired effect, Kazan never told Quinn that he had misled him. It was only many years later, after comparing notes, that Brando and Quinn realized the deception.|$|E
2500|$|Relations {{with the}} United States were often {{strained}} and even verged on war when Britain almost supported the Confederacy {{in the early}} part of the [...] American Civil War. British leaders were constantly annoyed from the 1840s to the 1860s by what they saw as Washington's pandering to the democratic mob, as in the Oregon boundary dispute in 1844 to 1846. However, British middle-class public opinion <b>sensed</b> <b>a</b> common [...] "Special Relationship" [...] between the two peoples, based on language, migration, evangelical Protestantism, liberal traditions, and extensive trade. Also, the Civil War was viewed in Britain as a slavery issue, with the North opposing slavery and the South supporting it. Only 25 years earlier, William Wilberforce had made the abolition of slavery a major cause in Britain, which outlawed the institution via the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. That constituency rejected both war and slavery, forcing London to appease the Americans.|$|E
2500|$|After {{graduating from}} the Professional Performing Arts School, Keys was {{accepted}} to Columbia University. She dropped out after four weeks to pursue her music career. She signed a demo deal with Jermaine Dupri and his So So Def label. Keys co-wrote and recorded a song titled [...] "Dah Dee Dah (Sexy Thing)", which appeared on the soundtrack to the 1997 hit film, Men in Black. She {{also contributed to the}} So So Def Christmas recordings. Keys began writing, producing and recording the album in 1998. She completed it that same year, but it was rejected by Columbia Records. Keys explained that the producers she worked with would tell her to [...] "just get in the booth and sing", which frustrated her. Her record contract with Columbia ended after a dispute with the label. Keys then performed for Clive Davis, who <b>sensed</b> <b>a</b> [...] "special, unique" [...] artist; he bought Keys' contract from Columbia and signed her to Arista Records, which later disbanded.|$|E
