40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} {{has been}} used as a method of suicide and execution ever since ancient times. Nowadays most deaths due to carbon monoxide poisoning are accidental. Still, even in the last decades, this colourless and odourless gas {{has been used}} as a method of euthanasia and medically assisted suicide. Dr. Jack Kevorkian, pathologist, stated that he had helped more than 130 people in committing suicide, using in the vast majority of cases a cylinder with carbon monoxide attached through a hose to a facial mask (Mercitron). During World War II, carbon monoxide {{has been used as}} means of euthanasia, both in the Action T 4 program (euthanasia program for the terminally ill and for persons with physical and mental disabilities) and in the Nazi extermination camps. In both cases, the extreme violation of the principles of medical ethics (disregard for the principles of personal autonomy, beneficence and non-maleficence) and the failure to comply with the precepts of the Hippocratic Oath (” [...] . measures for the benefit of the <b>sick</b> according <b>to</b> <b>my</b> ability and judgment; I will keep them from harm and injustice.

He would often loosen his tie before he ever started speaking, {{and by the end}} of his speech have thrown off his vest and coat. In one instance, the candidates debated a tax on dog owners of one dollar per dog. Stanley favored the tax, while Morrow contended that everyone should be allowed one dog tax-free. Stanley ridiculed the idea as [...] "Free Old Dog Ring," [...] and sometimes howled like a dog in speeches deriding the proposal. On another occasion Stanley, who had too much to drink, vomited in front of the audience as Morrow spoke.

500|$|In July 2009, U.S. Senator James Webb {{asked the}} U.S. DoD Inspector General to {{formally}} examine the battle and the U.S. Army's {{investigation into the}} event. In his request, Webb cited an unreleased report from the Army's Combat Studies Institute by a contractor, Douglas Cubbison, that criticized how senior Army leaders in Afghanistan, especially Ostlund and Preyser, acted before the assault at Wanat. According to that report, soldiers at the Wanat base were critically short of basic necessities such as water and sandbags and had complained repeatedly, to no avail, that their base was in a precarious position. [...] Cubbison had written the report {{at the request of}} Lieutenant General William B. Caldwell IV, commander of the United States Army Combined Arms Center. Cubbison wrote that {{a few days before the}} battle, on July 4, a U.S. Army helicopter mistakenly attacked and killed 17 civilians, including all of the doctors and nurses at a local clinic, infuriating local Afghans. Platoon leader Brostrom and company commander Captain Matthew Myer told their commanders that they expected a retaliatory attack and asked for extra surveillance. Brostrom's father, retired Army Colonel David. P. Brostrom, alerted Webb's office to the Army historian's report. Said Brostrom, [...] "After I read the report, I was <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> stomach." ...|$|E

[...] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: [...] "Every time I hear the word 'conservative,' it makes me <b>sick</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> stomach, because they're really just fake Christians, as I call them. That's all they are. ... I think they want to be judge and jury. Like, I'm for gay marriage. It's none of my business if gay people want to get married. I'm pro-choice. And I think these Christians, first of all, they're not supposed to judge other people. But they're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the hell out of me. They act like they're Christians. They're not forgiving at all." [...] During a 2011 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King's daughter Bernice, by saying, [...] "People try to make it about black and white.

60|$|He {{handed me}} the {{photograph}} he held in his fingers. I took it, all on fire. The sight almost made me turn <b>sick</b> with horror. <b>To</b> <b>my</b> awe and amazement, it was indeed the very scene I remembered so well. Only, of course, it was taken from another point of view, and represented things in rather different relative positions to those I figured them in. But it showed my father's body lying dead upon the floor; it showed his poor corpse weltering helpless in its blood; it showed myself, as a girl of eighteen, standing awestruck, gazing on in blank horror at the sight; and in the background, half blurred by the summer evening light, it showed the vague outline of a man's back, {{getting out of the}} window. On one side was the door: that formed no part of my mental picture, because it was at my back; but in the photograph it too was indistinct, as if in the very act of being burst open. The details were vague, in part--probably the picture had never been properly focussed;--but the main figures stood out with perfect clearness, and everything in the room was, allowing for the changed point of view, exactly as I remembered it in my persistent mental photograph.|$|R
