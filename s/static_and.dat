From 12 December the regiment was working to extend a sangar and enjoyed fresh meat, bread, vegetables, and rum. On 17 December bivouac sheets and blankets arrived. The weather continued cold and showery, but the good rations and extra blankets and bivouac shelters lifted morale.|$|E
5|$|Consciously or unconsciously, most theists see in {{gods and}} devils, heaven and hell, reward and punishment, a whip to lash the people into obedience, meekness and contentment....

5|$|Another {{important}} factor in the evaluation of chess positions is the pawn structure (sometimes known as the pawn skeleton), or the configuration of pawns on the chessboard. Since pawns are the least mobile of the chess pieces, the pawn structure is relatively <b>static</b> <b>and</b> largely determines the strategic nature of the position. Weaknesses in the pawn structure, such as isolated, doubled, or backward pawns and , once created, are often permanent. Care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset (for example, by the possibility of developing an attack).|$|E

5|$|Architecturally, the {{elements}} {{characteristic of the}} style include: the ogival, redented towers shaped like lotus buds; half-galleries to broaden passageways; axial galleries connecting enclosures; and the cruciform terraces which appear along the main axis of the temple. Typical decorative elements are devatas (or apsaras), bas-reliefs, and on pediments extensive garlands and narrative scenes. The statuary of Angkor Wat is considered conservative, being more <b>static</b> <b>and</b> less graceful than earlier work. Other elements of the design have been destroyed by looting and the passage of time, including gilded stucco on the towers, gilding on some figures on the bas-reliefs, and wooden ceiling panels and doors.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{down the}} line, the train passes the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad mine train roller coaster {{attraction}} and traverses a swing bridge, which crosses a canal {{that connects the}} Rivers of America to a boat servicing area. This bridge was originally located in Wabasso, Florida, and was previously owned by the Florida East Coast Railway. The train then runs through an area where numerous <b>static</b> <b>and</b> Audio-Animatronic displays of Native Americans and wild animals can be seen. After that, the train goes under an overpass, passes the spur line leading to the WDWRR's roundhouse where its trains are stored and maintained, and arrives at its next stop at Fantasyland Station.|$|E
5|$|Country singer Taylor Swift's Fearless had {{the longest}} run among the {{releases}} that have reached peak position in 2008, spending 11 non-consecutive weeks {{beginning with the}} issue dated November 29 and continuing into the 2009 chart year. She is the only singer to have achieved the longest-running album as a country female recording act in the Billboard200 history. Swift is now ranked fifth {{on the list of}} solo female artists with the longest-running number-one album in Billboard history, tied with veterans Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. Other albums with extended chart runs include Jack Johnson's fifth studio album, Sleep Through the <b>Static,</b> <b>and</b> Metallica's ninth studio album, Death Magnetic; each spent three straight weeks on the chart. Three soundtrack albums topped the chart in 2008: Juno, Mamma Mia! and Twilight.|$|E

30|$|The {{correlation}} between <b>statics</b> <b>and</b> dynamics seems plausible. However, the strong correlation {{differences between the}} three dimensions remain unclear. We can exclude that the low {{correlation between}} <b>statics</b> <b>and</b> basic ideas {{is a consequence of}} test construction, i.e. of curricular focus within the “basic ideas”, because static problems are also explicitly addressed within the “basic ideas” dimension.|$|R
5|$|Darwin's speculations on {{the origin}} of species {{convinced}} him that cross-fertilisation {{played an important role in}} keeping specific forms consistent. He rejected the doctrine that the characteristics of a species were <b>static,</b> <b>and</b> was aware from animal husbandry that inbreeding could lead to changes, often deleterious. He thought that natural outbreeding through cross-fertilisation would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous. Cross-fertilisation would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community. His ideas were contrary to the common supposition that plants were usually self-fertilising, and so every summer Darwin investigated the contribution of insect pollination to the cross-pollination of flowers.|$|E

5|$|From Aristotle until Darwin, {{the natural}} world was {{predominantly}} considered <b>static</b> <b>and</b> unchanging. Prior to The Origin of Species, there was little appreciation or understanding of the dynamic and reciprocal relations between organisms, their adaptations, and the environment. An exception is the 1789 publication Natural History of Selborne by Gilbert White (1720–1793), considered {{by some to be}} one of the earliest texts on ecology. While Charles Darwin is mainly noted for his treatise on evolution, he was one of the founders of soil ecology, and he made note of the first ecological experiment in The Origin of Species. Evolutionary theory changed the way that researchers approached the ecological sciences.|$|E

5|$|Shostakovich's musical {{influence}} on later composers outside the former Soviet Union {{has been relatively}} slight, although Alfred Schnittke took up his eclecticism and his contrasts between the dynamic and the <b>static,</b> <b>and</b> some of André Previn's music shows clear links to Shostakovich's style of orchestration. His influence {{can also be seen}} in some Nordic composers, such as Lars-Erik Larsson. Many of his Russian contemporaries, and his pupils at the Leningrad Conservatory were strongly influenced by his style (including German Okunev, Boris Tishchenko, whose 5th Symphony of 1978 is dedicated to Shostakovich's memory, Sergei Slonimsky, and others). Shostakovich's conservative idiom has grown increasingly popular with audiences both within and beyond Russia, as the avant-garde has declined in influence and debate about his political views has developed.|$|E

25|$|<b>Static</b> <b>and</b> {{agitated}} {{cultures are}} conventional ways to produce bacterial cellulose.

Thus, reactors are designed to lessen culture time and inhibit the conversion of bacterial cellulose-producing strains into cellulose-negative mutants. Common reactors used are the rotating disk reactor, the rotary biofilm contactor (RBC), a bioreactor equipped with a spin filter, and a reactor with a silicone membrane.|$|E

Second, equilibrium selections that are not monotone increasing in the exogenous variables must be predicting unstable equilibria. Moreover, under some conditions monotone comparative <b>statics</b> <b>and</b> stability are equivalent. ...|$|R
