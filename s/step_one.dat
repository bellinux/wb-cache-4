5|$|Often, {{teams will}} finish a season with {{identical}} records. It becomes necessary, therefore, to devise means to break these ties, either {{to determine which}} teams will qualify for the playoffs, or to determine seeding in the playoff tournament. The rules below are applied in order until the tie is broken. If three teams are tied for one playoff spot and the third team is eliminated at any step, the tie breaker reverts to <b>step</b> <b>one</b> for the remaining two teams. If multiple playoff spots are at stake, the rules are applied in order until the first team qualifies, then the process is started again for the remaining teams.|$|E
5|$|The Moran model assumes {{overlapping}} generations. At {{each time}} <b>step,</b> <b>one</b> individual is chosen to reproduce and one individual is chosen to die. So in each timestep, {{the number of}} copies of a given allele can go up by one, go down by one, or can stay the same. This means that the transition matrix is tridiagonal, which means that mathematical solutions are easier for the Moran model than for the Wright–Fisher model. On the other hand, computer simulations are usually easier to perform using the Wright–Fisher model, because fewer time steps need to be calculated. In the Moran model, it takes N timesteps to get through one generation, where N is the effective population size. In the Wright–Fisher model, it takes just one.|$|E

25|$|The {{hypothesis}} in the inductive {{step that}} the statement holds for some n {{is called the}} induction hypothesis (or inductive hypothesis). To perform the inductive <b>step,</b> <b>one</b> assumes the induction hypothesis and then uses this assumption to prove the statement for n+1.|$|E

It can change directions after its first step, and is not restricted to following {{one of the eight}} orthogonal or diagonal directions. That is, it can also step to one of the in-between squares that a knight jumps to in Western chess.|$|E
25|$|This step is the enzymatic {{transfer}} of a phosphate group from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to ADP by phosphoglycerate kinase, forming ATP and 3-phosphoglycerate. At this step, glycolysis {{has reached the}} break-even point: 2 molecules of ATP were consumed, and 2 new molecules have now been synthesized. This <b>step,</b> <b>one</b> of the two substrate-level phosphorylation steps, requires ADP; thus, when the cell has plenty of ATP (and little ADP), this reaction does not occur. Because ATP decays relatively quickly {{when it is not}} metabolized, this is an important regulatory point in the glycolytic pathway.|$|E
25|$|One way to {{generate}} random samples from a binomial distribution {{is to use}} an inversion algorithm. To do so, one must calculate the probability that P(X=k) for all values k from 0 through n. (These probabilities should sum to a value close to one, in order to encompass the entire sample space.) Then by using a pseudorandom number generator {{to generate}} samples uniformly between 0 and 1, one can transform the calculated samples U into discrete numbers by using the probabilities calculated in <b>step</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E

25|$|Kitab al-Shamil is a {{book that}} went unpublished, but it gives insight into his view of {{medicine}} and human relations. His surgical technique had three stages. <b>Step</b> <b>one</b> was to give the patient information on how {{it was to be}} performed and the knowledge it was based on. The second step was to perform the surgery itself. The final step was to have a post-surgery appointment and a routine of checkups. There is also a description of a surgeon's responsibility when working with nurses, patients, or other surgeons.|$|E
25|$|Friedman {{realized}} that the new rotor machines would be important, and devoted some time to analysing Hebern's design. Over a period of years, he developed principles of analysis and discovered several problems common to most rotor-machine designs. Examples of some dangerous features included having rotors <b>step</b> <b>one</b> position with each keypress, and putting the fastest rotor (the one that turns with every keypress) {{at either end of}} the rotor series. In this case, by collecting enough ciphertext and applying a standard statistical method known as the kappa test, he showed that he could, albeit with great difficulty, crack any cipher generated by such a machine.|$|E
25|$|Catalytic partial {{hydrogenation}} necessarily produces trans-fats, {{because of}} the reaction mechanism. In the first reaction <b>step,</b> <b>one</b> hydrogen is added, with the other, coordinatively unsaturated, carbon being attached to the catalyst. The second step is the addition of hydrogen to the remaining carbon, producing a saturated fatty acid. The first step is reversible, such that the hydrogen is readsorbed on the catalyst and the double bond is re-formed. The intermediate with only one hydrogen added contains no double bond and can freely rotate. Thus, the double bond can re-form as either cis or trans, of which trans is favored, regardless the starting material. Complete hydrogenation also hydrogenates any produced trans fats to give saturated fats.|$|E

25|$|First, one {{extends the}} {{signature}} {{by adding a}} new constant symbol for every element of M. The complete theory of M for the extended signature σ' is called the elementary diagram of M. In the next <b>step</b> <b>one</b> adds κ many new constant symbols to the signature and adds to the elementary diagram of M the sentences c ≠ c for any two distinct new constant symbols c and c. Using the compactness theorem, the resulting theory is easily seen to be consistent. Since its models must have cardinality at least κ, the downward part of this theorem guarantees {{the existence of a}} model N which has cardinality exactly κ. It contains an isomorphic copy of M as an elementary substructure.|$|E
25|$|Kalân Mosque (Masjid-i Kalân), arguably {{completed}} in 1514, {{is equal to}} the Bibi-Khanym Mosque in Samarkand in size. The mosque is able to accommodate 12 thousand people. Although Kalyan Mosque and Bibi-Khanym Mosque of Samarkand are of the same type of building, they are different in terms of art of building. 288 monumental pylons serve as a support for the multidomed roofing of the galleries encircling the courtyard of Kalyan Mosque. The longitudinal axis of the courtyard ends up with a portal to the main chamber (maksura) with a cruciform hall, topped with a massive blue cupola on a mosaic drum. The edifice keeps many architectural curiosities, for example, a hole in one of domes. Through this hole one can see foundation of Kalyan Minaret. Then moving back step by <b>step,</b> <b>one</b> can count all belts of brickwork of the minaret to the rotunda.|$|E
500|$|The {{beginning}} of the third verse, [...] (For he hath regarded the low estate [...] ), is rendered even simpler: the sequences are repeated in even rhythm, then broadened and coloured by parallel triads. The continuation, [...] (for, behold, [...] ), builds in similar fashion, with all parts divided, to {{the climax of the}} first movement on the word [...] ("blessed" [...] or [...] "happy"), marked [...] "f dolce". The text [...] (all generations) is again given in sequences of descending lines, now alternating one measure of 6/8 and one of 4/4. While the bass sings the line first, the tenor adds a sequence of sustained notes rising step by <b>step</b> <b>one</b> fifth. In Bach's treatment of the same text, each entry of a fugue theme is one step, covering an octave in measures 15 to 20 of [...] A repeat of the text and the motifs of verse 1 concludes the movement, ending on , without retard, with accents on each syllable and cut short.|$|E
