40|$|Recent trends to {{miniaturized}} {{systems such}} as smartphones and wearables, {{as well as the}} rise of autonomous vehicles relying on all-electric and smart in-car systems, have brought unprecedented needs for superior performance, functionality, and cost requirements. Transistor scaling alone cannot meet these metrics unless the remaining system components such as substrates and interconnections are scaled down {{to bridge the gap between}} transistor and system scaling. In this regard, 3 D glass system packages have emerged as a promising alternative due to their ultra-short system interconnection lengths, higher component densities and system reliability enabled by the tailorable coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), high dimensional stability and surface smoothness, outstanding electrical properties and low-cost panel-level processability of glass. The research objectives are to demonstrate board-level reliability of large, thin, glass packages directly mounted on PCB with conventional BGAs at pitches of 400 µm SMT and smaller. Two key innovations are introduced to accomplish the objectives: a.) Reworkable circumferential polymer collars providing <b>strain-relief</b> at critical high stress concentration areas in the solder joints, b.) novel Mn-doped SACMTM solder to provide superior drop test performance without degrading thermomechanical reliability. Modeling, package and board design, fabrication and reliability characterization were carried out to demonstrate reliable board-level interconnections of large, ultra-thin glass packages. Finite-element modeling (FEM) was used to investigate the effectiveness of circumferential polymer collars as a <b>strain-relief</b> solution on fatigue performance. Experimental results with polymer collars indicated a 2 X improvement in drop performance and 30 % improvement in fatigue life. Failure analysis was performed using characterization techniques such as confocal surface acoustic microscopy (C-SAM), optical microscopy, X-ray imaging, and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectrometry (SEM/EDS). Model-to-experiment correlation was performed to validate the effectiveness of polymer collars as a <b>strain-relief</b> mechanism. Enhancement in board-level reliability performance with advances in solder materials based on Mn-doped SACMTM is demonstrated in the last part of the thesis.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{article focuses}} on flexskins {{comprising}} of a cellular substructure and pre-tensioned facesheet for shear morphing applications. The unit cell of the substructure is a strand with some <b>strain-relief</b> feature, and it supports a segment of pretensioned facesheet. The function of the <b>strain-relief</b> feature {{is to reduce the}} peak strains in the strand and consequently the actuation work during shear morphing. Central hexagonal cells, elliptical cells, and half elliptical cells in the strand provided the sought strain relief {{at the edges of the}} strand, but the sharp corners and the proximity of these central features to those from adjacent strands during shear morphing led to a tendency for the facesheet to wrinkle. Alleviating wrinkling by increasing facesheet pretension increases the morphing actuation work requirement. Facesheet wrinkling can also be reduced by increasing strand separation, but this too requires higher prestrain in the facesheet to limit out-of-plane displacement under aerodynamic loads. The best solution was found to be the use of Gaussian- or Cosine-shaped curved strands which reduced morphing actuation force requirements by around 30 % compared to straight strands used on a previous demonstration aircraft, and the peak strain levels to about 1. 2 % (down from 3. 3 % for straight strands), while avoiding facesheet wrinkling.

30|$|In summary, we find {{a stable}} {{periodic}} <b>strain-relief</b> template by using energy minimizations with the MD calculations and the self-consistent first-principles calculations. The (2 × 2)/(3 × 3) and (3 × 3)/(4 × 4) Pb bilayer/Cu(111) are stable structures among the [(n − 1) × (n − 1)]/(n × n) Pb bilayer/Cu(111) (n = 2, 3,…, 12) structures, which are calculated with MD simulations based on Chen–Möbius inversion potential. However, first-principles calculations show that the (3 × 3)/(4 × 4) Pb bilayer/Cu(111) is fully covered by Pb atoms with almost (1 × 1) atomic and electronic structures {{on the surface of}} Pb bilayer, and thus it is not suitable {{to be used as a}} periodic template. For the (2 × 2)/(3 × 3) Pb bilayer/Cu(111) stable structure, the ordered Pb semi-clusters are found to show a high-density array on the first Pb atoms layer, and the high and zero electron charge density areas periodically locate in the second Pb layer. These different areas with different atomic and electronic structure will lead to the selective adsorption of atoms on the surface of (2 × 2)/(3 × 3) Pb bilayer/Cu(111) structure. The further calculations on the eight adsorptions sites of Ge atoms on (2 × 2)/(3 × 3) Pb bilayer/Cu(111) structure also confirm this conclusion. Ge atoms prefer to adsorb on the S 3, S 4 and S 6 sites. This stable periodic template can be realized under certain experimental conditions. As a result, the <b>strain-relief</b> periodic (2 × 2)/(3 × 3) Pb bilayer/Cu(111) structure is a promising candidate for the new self-organized template to assemble ordered quantum dots on it with a very high density, and may be one of the new platforms for studying next-generation microelectronics. Our method may be useful for the search of other stable templates for quantum structure arrays, that is, superlattice of nanostructures with size and period much smaller than the wavelength of an electron.|$|E

30|$|Antimonide {{semiconductors}} {{have potential}} application {{in a wide}} range of electronic and opto-electronic devices due to their unique band-structure alignments, and small effective mass as well as high mobility for electrons [1 – 4]. While recent technical advancements have enabled high quality lattice matched GaSb epitaxy on native substrates, for many applications GaAs substrates are desirable. This is because of the following reasons: GaAs is inexpensive, has favorable thermal properties, transparent to more (long wave length) active regions, forms excellent n and p ohmic contacts, and can be semi-insulating compared to GaSb. However, the high (7.8 %) lattice mismatch between the GaSb epilayer and the GaAs substrate complicates the growth of sophisticated device structures. Currently, this mismatch is accommodated via metamorphic buffer layers [5] and <b>strain-relief</b> superlattices [6]. In metamorphic buffer layer approach, initially the strain within the critical thickness is accommodated by tetragonal distortion followed by defect formation and filtering. While this approach has enabled a number of device demonstrations [7], it exhibits several deficiencies such as the necessity to grow thick buffer layers (often > 1 μm), poor thermal and electrical conductivity, and has resulted in significant material degradation through the presence of threading dislocations (TDs).|$|E

We found that a Si-Ge interdiffusion induces a broadening of the nominal thickness of the Ge layer, producing a Six Ge 1 -x alloy as well as a higher Ge content in the last periods of the multilayer structure. Our measurements suggest that the strain relaxation occurs in two steps: i) in each period of the multilayer the strain energy density is partially reduced by the formation of coherent islands; ii) at a certain value of the strain energy density, the shape of the coherent islands changes and the structures, partially or completely, relax the accumulated strain energy by nucleation of dislocations.

The quantitative analysis of the fine structure of intensity distribution combining with kinematic electron diffraction simulation confirms that for such a Ag FTNW, the intrinsic 7. 35 ° angular deficiency results in an inhomogeneous strain field within each single crystalline segment consistent with the disclination model of stress-relief. Moreover, the five crystalline segments {{are found to be}} strained differently.

The InAs/InGaAs/GaAs QD heterostructure was grown by solid-source molecular beam epitaxy (SS-MBE) and investigated via photoluminescence (PL), spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE), and picosecond time-resolved photoluminescence. Distinctive double-emission peaks are observed in the PL spectra of the sample. From the excitation power-dependent and temperature-dependent PL measurements, these emission peaks are associated with the ground-state transition from InAs QDs with two different size populations. Luminescence measurements were carried out as function of temperature in the range of 10 – 300  K by the PL technique. The low temperature PL has shown an abnormal emission which appeared at the low energy side and is attributed to the recombination through the deep levels. The PL peak energy presents an anomalous behavior {{as a result of the}} competition process between localized and delocalized carriers. We propose the localized-state ensemble model to explain the usual photoluminescence behaviors. The quantitative study shows that the quantum well continuum states act as a transit channel for the redistribution of thermally activated carriers. We have determined the localization depth and its effect on the application of the investigated heterostructure for photovoltaic cells. The model gives an overview to a possible amelioration of the InAs/InGaAs/GaAs QDs SCs properties based on the theoretical calculations.|$|E

As a result, the non-IPR fullerene isomer with lowest energy should be the structure with as few pentagon fusions as possible. To stabilize non-IPR fullerenes, the structural strain associated with adjacent pentagons can be released by transforming the carbon atoms at the pentagon fusion from sp 2 to sp 3 hybridization. 4 This is the so-called <b>strain-relief</b> principle for stabilization of a non-IPR fullerene by exohedral derivatization. 4 Together with the local aromaticity principle, which states that the most stable derivative of a non-IPR fullerene should have the remaining sp 2 -hybridized carbon framework be aromatic or conjugated, 4 it is useful for predicting possible structures of non-IPR fullerene derivatives. 4,[*] 5 National Basic Research 973 Program of China [2011 CB 935901]; National Nature Science Foundation of China [21031004, 21021061]; NFFTBS [J 1030415...|$|E

The two methods are molecular dynamics (MD) method based on Chen–Möbius inversion interfacial potential [14 – 18] and self-consistent first-principles method. Some experiments described a method to create almost monodisperse, equally spaced nanostructures through the self-organization of a fcc metal film on fcc metal (111) substrates with a periodic <b>strain-relief</b> template [2]. The nanostructures are stable, which are partly due to that the fcc metal (111) surface is a very stable surface with a very low surface energy [19]. Recently, there are increasing experiments studying the system of Pb atoms deposited on Cu(111) surface using the low-energy electron microscope (LEEM) and the scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) [20]. But as far as we know, very little theoretical study has been performed on the structure of Pb bilayer on Cu(111) surface. The lattice constant misfit ratio (37.1 %) between Pb and Cu is very large, so the achievable periodicity of the Pb/Cu(111) template can be very short, if the system is stable. Thus, it will be easy to perform further theoretical study on the stable template with a very high density periodic structure, which may reveal important information for potential applications, e.g. in the high-density memory, catalysis or developing nanostructured device technology. In this paper, we identify a stable template of Pb bilayer on Cu(111) surface with a periodic nanometer structure and reveal the atomic and electronic structure properties of the template.|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the Monte Carlo {{method is}} {{applied for the}} study of {{semiconductor}} surfaces. The focus is in the investigation of structural properties of epitaxially grown thin films on the Si(001) surface. Semiconductor surfaces are typically characterized by complicated energy landscapes, and the properties of these systems are often strongly influenced by long-range elastic effects. The Monte Carlo method is an attractive choice for large-scale relaxational problems because it is not bound to the true dynamical evolution of the system. This freedom can be utilized in designing new advanced algorithms which can significantly speed up the equilibration process. When combined with the computational efficiency of classical potentials, this approach can be used to reach even experimentally accessible time and length scales. In this work, different silicon potentials are tested to evaluate their ability to describe the properties of Si(001), including the surface reconstruction and various defect structures. Significant differences are found in the performance of the tested models. Some of the potentials are poorly suited for finite-temperature surface simulations, while the Stillinger-Weber (SW) potential gives a fairly accurate overall description of Si(001). The SW model is applied to study the effects of lattice-mismatch induced strain in the heteroepitaxial growth of Ge on Si(001). The surface undergoes a structural evolution in which the morphological changes are driven by a complex interplay between different temperature-dependent <b>strain-relief</b> mechanisms. The simulations provide a good overall explanation for experimental observations.

40|$|The domain {{configurations}} and piezoelectric {{coefficient of}} ferroelectric {{materials such as}} PZT and PMN-PT thin films can {{have a significant effect}} on the optimization of future electronic devices. Piezo Force Microscopy (PFM) is an ideal tool based on Atomic Force Microscopy that allows unique investigations of such nanoscale effects, and can further be implemented to monitor domain switching dynamics. Utilizing PFM, the domain orientations as well as switching dynamics can be tracked in-situ. As the lateral dimension plays an important role in ferroelectric properties since it influences in-plane strain, both normal and lateral domain orientations are uniquely mapped simultaneously. Leveraging a new method for fabricating ferroelectric mesas down to the nanoscale, coercive fields and switching kinetics have thereby been investigated for continuous strained films as well as geometrically strain-relieved samples. A piezoelectric enhancement at edges of engineered nano islands is directly observed, while switching activation energies have been calculated and related to the <b>strain-relief</b> behavior. Piezoelectric coefficients in the surface normal direction were precisely measured on 2 μm, 1 μm and 0. 75 μm wide PMN-PT microfabricated structures. These revealed piezoelectric enhancements up to 500 nm from feature edges for 2 μm or wider structures, and an increasing overall enhancement throughout smaller 1 μm and 0. 75 μm structures as the strain relief becomes more complete. These results are corroborated by X-RAY diffraction and dielectric measurements from collaborators. The enhancement of dielectric and piezoelectric properties for geometrically strain relieved structures should furthermore be applicable to in-plane piezoactuation. Accordingly, lateral piezoactuation for PMN-PT microstructures is recorded for 4 μm and 2 μm features revealing xiv direction-dependent edge enhancement as hypothesized.

One of the challenges currently faced by nuclear utility EDF Energy is the need to predict, with high certainty, the life-time of ageing engineering plant operating in the creep regime. A study of creep cavities near a reheat crack, ∼ 28 mm long, in an AISI Type 316 H austenitic stainless steel header is reported. The cracked component was removed after 65, 000 hours operation at a mean temperature of 525 °C in a nuclear power plant. Creep cavities {{in the vicinity of the}} crack are observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and found to be mainly surrounding inter-granular carbides. Optimized metallographic and image analysis procedures are used to quantify the size and area fraction of creep cavities as a function of distance from the crack along a line normal to the crack face. Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) is used to quantify creep cavitation, averaged over a large gauge volume, ∼ 20 mm 3, at similar positions normal to the crack line. A systematic increase in the true fractional size distribution of cavities is observed approaching the crack. The cavity size distribution peaks between 100 – 300 nm diameter and this correlates closely with the quantitative metallography results of cavities in this sample. SANS has the advantage of being non-destructive and also the examined volume is several mm 3, against an area of hundreds of μm 2 in the case of SEM, therefore giving more statistically significant results.

As a step further toward the lateral miniaturization of functional nanostructures, this work uncovers the role of misfit dislocations in creating periodic surface strain patterns that can be efficiently used to control the spatial modulation of mass transport phenomena and bandwidth-dependent properties on a ≈ 20 nm length scale. The spontaneous formation of surface <b>strain-relief</b> patterns in La 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 MnO 3 /LaAlO 3 films results in lateral periodic modulations of the surface chemical potential and tetragonal distortion, controlling the spatial distribution of preferential nucleation sites and the bandwidth of the epilayer, respectively.

40|$|In this study, {{material}} {{investigations of}} strained Si/SiGe platforms for MOSFET applications are presented. The device performance advantages of introducing strain in the MOSFET channel have become well established in recent years. Biaxial strain changes carrier mobility by altering the band {{structure of the}} channel, leading {{to a reduction in}} carrier effective mass and the time between scattering events. Electron mobility benefits from the tensile strain achieved by the epitaxial growth of Si on a strain-relaxed SiGe buffer (SRB). Since holes, in contrast, benefit from compressive strein, dual-channel architectures comprising a compressively strained SiGe layer beneath a tensely strained Si surface channel have been proposed for CMOS applications. However, dual-channel nMOSFETs consistently exhibit lower performance than those fabricated on single channel structures having the same channel strain. This difference has been attributed to additional midscale surface corrugations induced by the buried SiGe. This additional roughness had not been characterised separately from the large-scale crosshatch morphology commonly observed in SiGe SRBs. In this work, a surface roughness analysis technique has been developed to study the separate contribution from surface roughne~s components at different scales. It is shown that the addition,a. l midscale roughness induced by the buried compressive SiGe channel is fundamentally governed by the degree of compressive strain. Results correlate well with electrical data from devices fabricated on dual-channel structures. The use of supercritical strained Si channels is an alternative to improve hole mobility without incurring in additional midscale surface roughness introduced by compressive strain in the dual channel. Biaxially strained channels are commonly formed by growing Si on a strain-relaxed SiGe buffer (SRB). However, the device self-heating due to the low thermal conductivity of SiGe remains an obstacle to realising the full advantages of strained Si technology. Self-heating effects are further aggravated by the fact that SiGe buffers are typically several microns thick. Novel epitaxy techniques have enabled the production of ultrathin SRB in order to lessen the impact of selfheating. In this work, the material quality and stability of thin SRBs produced by two different growth techniques are investigated in terms of surface morphology and crystal defects. Both sub- and supercritical thickness layers are studied. Supercritical thickness layers have the potential to eliminate several challenges associated with processing SiGe, if material quality can be maintained. Also, improved hole mobility could be achieved in supercritical highly~strainedSi layers. The thermal stability of the thin SRB grown by a carbon-induced-relaxation technique is analysed by annealing the material at temperatures commonly used during device processing. Although strain measurements by Raman spectroscopy suggest good thermal resilience of this thin SRB, chemical defect etching demonstrates the evolution of dislocations, suggesting a weak thermal resilience. Supercritical strained Si layers growp on these thin SRBs exhibited prominent surface defects, most likely resultingÃ‚Â·from additional <b>strain-relief</b> mechanisms in the thin SRB in addition to stacking faults. Defect etching techniques were developed in order to distinguish defect types from individual layers throughout the epitaxial layer stack. MOSFETs were also fabricated on thin SiGe buffers produced by a lowtemperature growth method and performance was compared with co-processed devices on a conventional thick SRB. The thin SRB devices exhibited reduced selfheating levels in comparison with conventional thick SRB devices. The lowtemperature growth technique leads to reduced surface roughness, which appears to improve key 'electrical parameters in addition to mobility, including gate leakage, reliability, noise and interface trap density. The impact of growth temperature on surface roughness and performance is also analysed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Transistor scaling, {{driven by}} Moore’s Law, has enabled the {{integration}} of billions of transistors on a single integrated chip (IC); thereby enabling rapid miniaturization of microprocessor devices such as smartphones, servers and personal computers. However, silicon integration following Moore's law is now reaching its limits due to increasing design complexity and cost, bringing {{the need for a}} new "System Scaling" approach for further miniaturization and performance improvements. The System-on-Package (SOP) approach, pioneered by Georgia Tech PRC, relies on co-integration of multiple electronic functions on a package substrate, as opposed to on-chip. Packaging, therefore, becomes key in enabling higher functional densities. An example of this new approach to system design is the recent trend of "split dies" where a large devices is broken down into smaller devices at finer I/O pitches that are interconnected on a substrate using high-density wiring. These advanced package architectures such as 2. 5 D interposer packages now rely on packaging to improve performance and miniaturize the system as a whole. Silicon interposers are particularly attractive in such split-die applications due to their outstanding lithographic capability enabling high-density, high-speed die-to-die interconnections. Such 2. 5 D interposers tend to be fairly large with body sizes exceeding 30 mmx 40 mm, bringing unprecedented board-level reliability challenges due to large mismatch in coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) between silicon and mother boards. These challenges are typically addressed by introducing an additional organic BGA package between interposer and board to accommodate for the CTE mismatch and decrease in pitch. However, this degrades electrical performance with longer interconnection lengths, and adds to the overall cost. Glass has emerged as an alternative substrate technology to overcome the shortcomings of silicon. Glass has been demonstrated to have superior electrical properties than silicon with lower losses and can accommodate high-density wiring owing to micron-scale lithographic design rules. Further, glass can be tailored for a wide CTE range of 3. 3 to 9. 8 ppm/K. This unique property brings design flexibility to address board-level reliability challenges and directly assemble large glass interposer packages to boards without the need for an intermediate organic package. The primary objective of this research is to model, design and demonstrate a large, 2. 5 D glass BGA package with 1) direct SMT-to-board interconnection; and 2) balanced chip- and- board-level reliability. The ultimate goal is to provide guidelines for the design of 2. 5 D glass BGA packages, optimizing the glass CTE to mitigate warpage and achieve system-level reliability, and subsequently the assembly process and sequence. Finite-element models were built to assess the reliability of 2. 5 D glass packages with direct SMT assembly to the board. The methodology for achieving balanced chip- and- board-level reliability was validated through focused modeling and experimental results for a single-chip package. Board-level reliability was recognized as the most critical challenge and enhanced by using innovative doped solder materials such as Indium’s Mn-doped SACmTM alloy and <b>strain-relief</b> mechanisms to give more design flexibility. Failure distribution analysis and optical characterization was performed to evaluate thermal cycling reliability. A process design approach was demonstrated for mitigating warpage induced by thermocompression bonding on ultra-thin, low- and- high-CTE substrates at I/O pitches below 50 µm. By selecting optimum thermal profiles for mitigating chip-level assembly warpage, board-level assembly is enabled at larger package sizes, and system-level reliability is thereby enhanced. M.
