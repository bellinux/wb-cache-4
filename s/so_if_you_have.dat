500|$|Fortunately for Northrup – {{as it was}} {{the peak}} of the McCarthyite [...] "Red Scare" [...] – Hubbard's {{allegations}} were apparently ignored by the FBI, which filed his letter but took no further action. In June 1951, she finally secured the return of Alexis by agreeing to cancel her receivership action and divorce suit in California in return for a divorce [...] "guaranteed by L. Ron Hubbard". She met him in Wichita to resolve the situation. He told her that she was [...] "in a state of complete madness" [...] due to being dictated to and hypnotized by Hollister and his [...] "communist cell". Playing along, she told Hubbard that he was right and that the only way she could break free of their power was by going through with the divorce. He replied, [...] "You know, I'm a public figure and you're nobody, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to go through the divorce, I'll accuse you of desertion so it won't look so bad on my public record." [...] She agreed to sign a statement, written by Hubbard himself, that retracted the allegations that she had made against him: ...|$|E
2500|$|Anthony Kiedis {{was asked}} in a December 2016 {{interview}} if he ever plans to retire {{and he said that}} he expects to be writing music until the day he dies. [...] "We might always be writing music, writing songs...I can't imagine that going away. I want to write a song today, tomorrow. That's quite a satisfying thing to do. I think about it all the time, there's so many things that I want to sing, melodies, and lyrics. <b>So,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> people you want to work with for a lifetime, there's no reason you can't write songs until the day you die." ...|$|E
2500|$|Willem Dafoe as [...] "He": Dafoe, who had {{previously}} worked with Lars von Trier in Manderlay from 2005, was cast after contacting Trier and asking what {{he was working on}} at the moment. He received the script for Antichrist, although he was told that Trier's wife was skeptical about asking a renowned actor like Dafoe to do such an extreme role. Dafoe accepted the part, later explaining its appeal to him: [...] "I think the dark stuff, the unspoken stuff is more potent for an actor. It's the stuff we don't talk about, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the opportunity to apply yourself to that stuff in a playful, creative way, yes I'm attracted to it." [...] The voice of the talking fox was also supplied by Dafoe, although the recording was heavily manipulated.|$|E
60|$|Isaac {{meant to}} be complimentary, though <b>you</b> mightn't <b>have</b> thought <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> seen the face of that dog.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Seriously, Cilly! Ah, I see now--your {{exclusive}} {{attention to}} him entirely reassures me. <b>You</b> would never <b>have</b> served him <b>so,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> meant it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I don't lime that," [...] said Stanmer. He {{was silent}} a while, {{and then he}} added--"Perhaps she wouldn't <b>have</b> done <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> remained." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Right, Joe, right, <b>so,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no objection, we {{will leave}} it to them," [...] said Dominick, [...] "and now as to the ceremonial?" ...|$|E
60|$|Just. Why zounds, madam, how durst {{you talk}} <b>so?</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{no respect for}} your husband, I should think unus quorum might command a little deference.|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean cats," [...] he replied, [...] "or rather kittens. I am {{very fond}} of kittens, and at present we have not one in the house. <b>So,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a kitten--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{would not}} <b>have</b> said <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> seen her {{three years and}} a half ago, when I picked her out from a slum in London.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You wouldn't say <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{seen him}} chasing me upstairs {{with a hard}} leather strap," [...] he said; [...] "I haven't {{forgotten}} it in sixteen years." ...|$|R
6000|$|Violet sat up, {{took her}} hand, pressed it between both hers, and with tears exclaimed: 'You must not speak <b>so.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not that grace, {{should you be}} sorry now?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I'm rather {{busy with}} our new Long Island operations, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a date to-morrow, the matter can wait, but I thought you'd better have the {{suggestions}} {{while they were}} fresh in my mind. But perhaps I can lunch with you week after next, if--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Part of this I {{have already}} seen," [...] said Oliver, [...] "the rest I hope {{to live to}} see, but in the {{meantime}} tin is uppermost in my mind; <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no objection I should like {{to have a look at}} the tin-smelting works. What say you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose so," [...] I answered. [...] "At {{any rate}} we speak as man to man, and {{hitherto}} the honour of Macumazahn {{has not been}} doubted in Zululand. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> anything to say, Chief Bulalio, say it at once, for I am tired and should like to eat and rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No one's {{business}}!' exclaimed {{the young}} clergyman. 'It is every one's business to see justice done, {{and it should}} never <b>have</b> gone on <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> spoken. Why didn't you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You? You are {{the last}} to do <b>so.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> only been let alone, the beast would have been {{captured}} unhurt. No, no! I settled all that, as it was I who meddled in the matter when, I believe, <b>you</b> could <b>have</b> settled him yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been {{painting}} duchesses then, with {{a studio}} in Kensington Gardens, would not <b>have</b> said <b>so,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> happened to come across me. I can't define a gentleman, even in my own mind;--but I can define {{the sort of man}} with whom I think I can live pleasantly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it {{is eight}} o'clock now, {{and if you}} start at midnight it will be soon enough; <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{finished}} your supper, you had better lie down on that bed {{in the next room}} and get a sleep; for you were marching all last night, and will want some rest before starting on such a journey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed, sir, I'm afraid not,' said Harry. 'I saw Captain Gordon at Portsmouth this morning, and {{he tells}} me he is {{to go out in the}} Clio to the Pacific station, and would apply for me as his first lieutenant, if I liked to look up the islands again. <b>So,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> any {{commissions}} for Norman, I'm your man.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is {{the only}} chance. He has been {{forbidden}} the walking with them in his arms to put them to sleep, and we've got the boy into the nursery, and he'd better {{be out of the}} house than hear them roaring for him. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no objection, and he is tolerable this evening, I would bring him as soon as they are gone to bed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all. She {{would not}} <b>have</b> said <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not {{provoked}} her." [...] Before reaching home, Fred concluded {{that he would}} tell the whole affair as simply as possible to his father, who might perhaps take on himself the unpleasant business of speaking to Bulstrode.|$|R
60|$|Harry. <b>You</b> wouldn't say <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{seen him}} walloping {{me with a}} hard leather strap. (Walking up garden.) I haven't {{forgotten}} it in sixteen long years. (Rat-tat-tat twice.) Hullo, Dad. (Bessie intensely expectant. Rat-tat-tat.) Hullo, Dad--let me in. I am your own Harry. Straight. Your son Harry come back home--a day too soon.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} sure, I hope," [...] said the youth, [...] "that {{it does not}} disturb you to be overlooked? You know I would not presume to do <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not promised to permit me. My great desire, for many a day, has been to observe the process of {{painting}} in oils by one who understands it." ...|$|R
6000|$|The shabby woman {{laughed a}} little. Her teeth, splendidly white and admirably even, looked absurdly out of place, like {{a string of}} pearls on the neck of a ragged tramp. [...] "Peter Ivanovitch is the {{greatest}} genius of the century perhaps, {{but he is the}} most inconsiderate man living. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> an appointment with him you must not be surprised to hear that he is not here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is as one may think,' said he, mentally {{contrasting}} the flaunting, hardened complexion {{before him}} with the sweet countenance he had never perceived to be pinched or faded; and as he heard something between a scornful sniff and a sob, he added, 'I am wanted in the office, <b>so,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no more to say of any consequence, I must leave you, and Hannah shall give you some tea.' ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{this the}} other burst out a-laughing. [...] "Come," [...] says he, [...] "you are indeed of right mettle, and I like your spirit. All the same, {{no one in}} all the world means you less ill than I, and <b>so,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to use that barker, 'twill not be upon us who are your friends, but only upon one who is more wicked than the devil himself. So come, and let us get away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why do {{you call}} {{yourself}} unintelligent?" [...] she protested. [...] "You couldn't have got through your soldiering <b>so</b> well <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never. It {{might have}} made a great {{difference}} to me if Dusautoy had been here at the time of my trouble. When he did come, I had sunk into a state whence I could not rouse myself to understand his principles. I can hardly describe how intolerable my life had become. I was almost resolved on returning to India. I believe I should <b>have</b> done <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not come to my rescue.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{might not}} <b>have</b> said <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> seen bad weather; and moreover, {{it is one}} thing to be a {{passenger}} with nought to do but to amuse yourself, and another to be always hauling at ropes and washing down decks as a sailor. I am glad night is coming on, for I feel strange in this country I know nothing of, and in the dark one place is like another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{you never}} noticed that most reputations are undeserved? Chabrillane was a {{dangerous}} swordsman, and Chabrillane is underground. La Motte-Royau was an even more dangerous swordsman, and {{he is in a}} surgeon's hands. So are the other spadassinicides who dreamt of skewering a poor sheep of a provincial lawyer. And here to-day comes the chief, the fine flower of these bully-swordsmen. He comes, for wages long overdue. Be sure of that. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no other reason to urge..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is right," [...] Captain Bayley said, [...] "we {{will travel}} together, my dear sir; for {{of course we}} shall go {{straight}} back to England now. We have been dawdling about in this wretched country long enough. Besides, {{everything has to be}} arranged, and we have got {{to get to the bottom}} of this matter; <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no objection, we will travel home together. If the young people here want to dawdle about any longer they can do so; I dare say they can look after themselves, or if not, I can make an arrangement with some old lady or other to act as Alice's chaperon." ...|$|E
6000|$|De Catinat {{burst out}} {{laughing}} again. [...] "By my faith, you will find Paris livelier than ever," [...] said he, [...] "if you blaze your way through on the door-posts as you would on the trees of a forest. But perchance {{it would be as}} well that you should have a guide at first; <b>so,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> two horses ready in your stables, uncle, our friend and I might shortly ride back to Versailles together, for I have a spell of guard again before many hours are over. Then for some days he might bide with me there, if he will share a soldier's quarters, and so see more than the Rue St. Martin can offer. How would that suit you, Monsieur Green?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{shall be}} done; {{we will use}} the {{thinnest}} paper, <b>so</b> that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to swallow them you can do so without difficulty." ...|$|R
60|$|W. Not {{act like}} a traitor, but like one that was once a Christian, and would <b>have</b> been <b>so</b> still, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> not been a Dutchman.|$|R
50|$|Records that {{absolutely}} must {{be managed by}} a record locking process are those which are processor shared. In TPF, most record accesses are done by using record type and ordinal. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> defined a record type in the TPF system of 'FRED' and gave it 100 records or ordinals, then in a processor shared scheme, record type 'FRED' ordinal '5' would resolve to exactly the same file address on DASD — clearly necessitating {{the use of a}} record locking mechanism.|$|R
