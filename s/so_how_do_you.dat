5000|$|Since Jiajing was {{a devout}} Taoist, motifs popular in that {{tradition}} became widespread during his reign. While fish came with many associations, including pleasure, abundance, success, and royalty, {{one of the}} best-known associations comes from the fourth-century BC Taoist philosophers Zhuangzi and Huizi. Zhuangzi said, “See how the fish swim as they please. That’s what fish really enjoy.” When Huizi asked, “How do you know what fish enjoy?” Zhuangzi replied, “You’re not I, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know I don’t know what fish enjoy?” ...|$|E

50|$|I {{wanted to}} capture {{the spirit of the}} Ealing comedies and British films of the ‘50s and ‘60s that were clearly aimed at {{children}} and delivered action and fun in a largely cartoonish way. If you look at the basic premise of the plot, the crooks clearly want to or intend to kill the children at some point, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> disguise that and make that palatable to an audience of kids and parents?

5000|$|An {{illustration}} of the alternative uses of [...] "fei" [...] {{may be found in}} the widely known [...] "Happiness of Fish" [...] dialogue in Zhuangzi (17, tr. Watson 1968:188-9). Huizi says [...] "You're not a fish 子非魚 [...] - [...] {{how do you know what}} fish enjoy?" [...] (denying that Zhuangzi is a member of the class of fish) and Zhuangzi replies [...] "You're not I 子非我, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know I don't know what fish enjoy?"

5000|$|A Jazz Singer parody which {{reverses the}} story by having musical guest Al Jarreau play a popular jazz singer {{who wants to}} become a cantor (hazzan). His father is a disapproving pop-music {{impresario}} played by Levys befuddled Sid Dithers. Hasidic Dithers, four feet tall and cross-eyed behind Coke-bottle glasses, speaks with a thick early vaudeville-style Yiddish accent ("San Fransishky? <b>So</b> <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> came: <b>did</b> <b>you</b> drove, or <b>did</b> <b>you</b> flew?"). The payoff of this parody makes for a classic SCTV moment: Jarreau has become a synagogue cantor, fulfilling his dream against his fathers wishes, and he wonders if his father will ever speak to him again, until, during the service, he is interrupted by a disco-clad Dithers standing in the doorway in dancing shoes, spangled jacket, and corn-rowed hair.|$|R

50|$|<b>So</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{deal with}} these {{cultural}} differences? How does one recognize to which culture a particular person identifies so {{that he or she}} will infer correctly all of the nonverbal cues associated with that culture? From such a potentially complicated question comes a relatively simple answer. Study, listen and learn. Communicators and leaders become successful because they observe the unconscious actions of others. Sometimes an individual’s actions are the result of their culture or upbringing and sometimes they are the result of the emotion or feeling they are portraying. Keen communicators are able {{to tell the difference between}} the two and effectively communicate based on their observations. Oculesics is not a standalone science. Combining the information obtained from eye movements and behaviors with other nonverbal cues such as Haptics, Kinesics, or Olfactics will lend the observer to a much more well rounded and accurate portrait of an individual’s behavior.|$|E

Jones later admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs during the games. Richardson and the other runners filed an appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport to contest their disqualification and retain their medals. In her defence, {{she said in an interview}} on The Early Show: [...] "I competed fairly.

5000|$|Most of {{the other}} Zhuangzi {{passages}} portray Hui Shi (Huizi) as a friendly rival of Zhuangzi. Hui Shi acts as an intellectual foil who argues the alternative viewpoint, or criticizes the Daoist perspective, often with moments of humor. The best known of the Zhuang-Hui dialogues concerns the subjectivity of happiness. Chuang Tzu and Hui Tzu were strolling along the dam of the Hao River when Chuang Tzu said, [...] "See how the minnows come out and dart around where they please! That's what fish really enjoy!"Hui Tzu said, [...] "You're not a fish - {{how do you know}} what fish enjoy?"Chuang Tzu said, [...] "You're not I, <b>so</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know I don't know what fish enjoy?"Hui Tzu said, [...] "I'm not you, so I certainly don't know what you know. On the other hand, you're certainly not a fish ‑ so that still proves you don't know what fish enjoy!"Chuang Tzu said, [...] "Let's go back to your original question, please.
