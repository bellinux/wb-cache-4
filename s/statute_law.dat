5|$|Radicals such as Sir Francis Burdett {{believed}} that Magna Carta {{could not be}} repealed, but in the 19th century clauses which were obsolete or had been superseded began to be repealed. The repeal of clause 36 in 1829, by the Offences against the Person Act 1828 (9 Geo. 4 c. 31 s. 1), {{was the first time}} a clause of Magna Carta was repealed. Over the next 140 years, nearly the whole of Magna Carta (1297) as statute was repealed, leaving just clauses 1, 9, and 29 still in force (in England and Wales) after 1969. Most of the clauses were repealed in England and Wales by the <b>Statute</b> <b>Law</b> Revision Act 1863, and in modern Northern Ireland and also in the modern Republic of Ireland by the <b>Statute</b> <b>Law</b> (Ireland) Revision Act 1872.|$|E

25|$|Another {{task of the}} council, {{of lesser}} {{importance}} in terms of number of referrals, is the reclassification of <b>statute</b> <b>law</b> into the domain of regulations, on the Prime Minister's request. This happens when the Prime Minister and his government wish to alter law that has been enacted as <b>statute</b> <b>law,</b> but should instead belong to regulations according to the Constitution. The Prime Minister has to obtain reclassification from the Council prior to taking any decree changing the regulations. This, however, is nowadays {{only a small fraction}} of the Council's activity: in 2008, out 140 of decisions, only 5 concerned reclassifications.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately, many Acts {{passed by}} the Governor General during this period were not {{relevant}} to the Straits Settlements, and {{it was difficult to}} determine which were applicable.
