GPS proved as critical throughout few different tasks it has in: velocity and heading aiding for IMU (drift correction), time synchronization, trigerring and navigation. Furthermore, several electro-optical sensors were integrated in airborne sensor pod, with hyperspectral puhbroom scanner and hybrid IMU/GPS system (serving as Position and Orientation System) in its core. Complete airborne multisensor system is built off-the-shelf, integrated by using PC running under Windows OS and aimed to different applications, such as spectral detection of oil polution spill at sea, quality monitoring of water in lakes and rivers and explosives polution detection at military fire range, etc. Good understanding of different application requirements, along with the characteristics and design specification of state of the art sensors, led to system integration, which has proved as operational during first flight tests and has already scheduled for airborne mapping campaignes over mine contaminated area in Croatia...|$|E
