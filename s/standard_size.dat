5|$|The book's current {{dimensions}} are 330 by 250mm. Originally, the folios were of no <b>standard</b> <b>size,</b> {{but they were}} cropped to the current size during a 19th-century rebinding. The text area is approximately 250 by 170mm. Each text page has 16 to 18 lines of text. The manuscript is in remarkably good condition considering its great age, though many pages have suffered some damage to the delicate artwork due to rubbing. The book {{must have been the}} product of a major scriptorium over several years, yet was apparently never finished, the projected decoration of some pages appearing only in outline. It is believed that some 30 folios of the original manuscript have been lost over the centuries. Ussher counted 344 folios in 1621, but several leaves had already been lost by then. The overall estimate is based on gaps in the text and the absence of certain key illustrations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Garment {{production}} {{is a high}} value-added industry in the global textile manufacturing chain. <b>Standard</b> <b>sizing</b> systems of garment are crucial issue, play an even important role for garment manufacturing industry. The extraction of knowledge from large database has been successfully applied {{in a number of}} advanced fields by data mining. However, little research has been done in the area of developing <b>standard</b> <b>sizing</b> systems of garment manufacture, using data mining. Focusing on the anthropometric data of adult males in Taiwan, the goal {{of this study was to}} develop <b>standard</b> <b>sizing</b> systems, using a novel cluster-based data mining cycle. Certain advantages may be observed when <b>standard</b> <b>sizing</b> systems are developed, using the data mining cycle. These include being able to cover a higher percentage of the population, using fewer sizes, and providing manufacturers with reference points to promote products, according to body type and distribution. Since the anthropometric database must be repeatedly updated, <b>standard</b> <b>sizing</b> systems may also be continuously renewed via application of the proposed data mining cycle. These <b>standard</b> <b>sizing</b> systems will remain continually beneficial for both production planning and reducing inventory costs, while facilitating the advanced garment manufacture.

25|$|The {{second point}} in the program {{accounted}} {{for the creation of}} a <b>standard</b> <b>size</b> for the flags and the poles they would be raised on. Zedillo's official decree stated that the flag sizes will be 14.3 meters in height by 25 meters in width. The flag size is close to the 4:7 ratio as stated in Article 3 of the Law on the National Coat of Arms, Flag and Anthem (Ley sobre el Escudo, la Bandera y el Himno Nacionales). The flagpoles were to have a height of 50 meters.|$|E
25|$|The {{components}} of a tennis racket include a handle, known as the grip, connected to a neck which joins a roughly elliptical frame that holds a matrix of tightly pulled strings. For the first 100 years of the modern game, rackets were made of wood and of <b>standard</b> <b>size,</b> and strings were of animal gut. Laminated wood construction yielded more strength in rackets used {{through most of the}} 20th century until first metal and then composites of carbon graphite, ceramics, and lighter metals such as titanium were introduced. These stronger materials enabled the production of oversized rackets that yielded yet more power. Meanwhile, technology led to the use of synthetic strings that match the feel of gut yet with added durability.|$|E
25|$|The {{playing time}} of a {{phonograph}} record depended on the turntable speed and the groove spacing. At {{the beginning of the}} 20th century, the early discs played for two minutes, the same as early cylinder records. The 12-inch disc, introduced by Victor in 1903, increased the playing time to three and a half minutes. Because a 10-inch 78rpm record could hold about three minutes of sound per side and the 10-inch size was the <b>standard</b> <b>size</b> for popular music, almost all popular recordings were limited to around three minutes in length. For example, when King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band, including Louis Armstrong on his first recordings, recorded 13 sides at Gennett Records in Richmond, Indiana, in 1923, one side was 2:09 and four sides were 2:52–2:59.|$|E

25|$|In 1916, Lang {{was elected}} mayor of St. Petersburg. During his {{four-year}} tenure, the city's population doubled as Lang relentlessly marketed the city's clean air, {{access to the}} ocean and relaxed lifestyle. As mayor, Lang established an ordinance making all benches in the city a <b>standard</b> <b>size</b> and the same color: green. Lang also extended the paving of streets {{and the construction of}} city parks along the waterfront with guaranteed access to the public. Lang took steps to clean up and revitalize the downtown area to include the construction of an open-air post office and the removal of store signs that were intrusive or offensive. During tourist season, Lang was known for greeting every train arriving in the city and personally welcoming the tourists as they disembarked.|$|E

Along with the {{acceptance}} letter, first-year students are sent a list of required equipment which includes a wand, subject books, a <b>standard</b> <b>size</b> 2 pewter cauldron, a set of brass scales, a set of glass or crystal phials, a kit of basic potion ingredients (for Potions), and a telescope (for Astronomy). The Hogwarts uniform consists of plain work robes in black, a plain black hat, a pair of protective gloves, and a black winter cloak with silver fastenings. Each uniform must contain the wearer's nametag. First years are not allowed a broomstick of their own, though an exception to this rule is made for Harry {{in his first year}} after he demonstrates an excellent ability as a Seeker in Quidditch.|$|E
25|$|A Schrader valve {{consists}} of a hollow cylindrical metal tube, typically brass, with the exterior end threaded. The interior end takes {{a variety of forms}} depending on its application. In the center of the exterior end is a metal pin pointing along the axis of the tube; the pin's end is flush {{with the end of the}} valve body. Generally, all Schrader valves are used on tires. They have threads and bodies of a single <b>standard</b> <b>size</b> at the exterior end, so caps and tools generally are universal for the valves on all automobile and bicycle pneumatic tires. Also, pressure valves can be used on Schrader valves in place of caps in order to measure the pressure of pneumatic tires. In 1891, George Schrader, the son of German-American immigrant August Schrader, invented the Schrader valve. A patent was issued on April 11, 1893.|$|E

25|$|Blizzard sold {{exclusive}} worldwide {{rights to}} develop, publish, and distribute console {{versions of the}} game to Electronic Arts in 1996. In 1998, a PlayStation version of Diablo was released, developed by Climax Studios and published by Electronic Arts. The game lacked online play, but featured a two-player cooperative mode. Notable differences to the PC version include the auto-aiming for range weapons and spells and an option for increased game speed. It features an option to learn the story through a narrator without having to find the books in the game. The European PAL version is fully translated and dubbed into French, German and Swedish {{in addition to the}} original English. The PlayStation version was infamous because of its need for 10 blocks on a PlayStation memory card; the <b>standard</b> <b>size</b> of memory cards for the platform was 15 blocks.|$|E
25|$|Trailer: Up to 1955 {{the trailer}} has a Q/Tnnn-nnn format in white on black base (with QT in reverse B). From 1955, the format was from NTA·000 to NTZ·999. In 1963 the blocks were {{recalled}} {{and replaced by}} two type formats the smaller trailer format from QZ-9999 to OA-0000 in white on black base, changing from 1988 to white on reflective green base from OK onwards. in 1993 the format began at AA-0000 and the 2002 changeover to Maroon on reflective white occurred in the BI-0000 series and now is in the E series. The <b>standard</b> <b>size</b> format for larger trailers in white on black runs from QVA-000 to QZZ-999 running from 1963 to 1988. In 1988 it switched to green on reflective white starting at 000-QAA then the 2002 change to maroon in the QHR-000 series and now in 000-QZZ range. As of 20 May 2015, 000-UBA was allocated onwards for new issues.|$|E
25|$|TEM {{specimen}} stage designs include airlocks {{to allow for}} insertion of the specimen holder into the vacuum with minimal loss of vacuum {{in other areas of}} the microscope. The specimen holders hold a <b>standard</b> <b>size</b> of sample grid or self-supporting specimen. Standard TEM grid sizes are 3.05mm diameter, with a thickness and mesh size ranging from a few to 100μm. The sample is placed onto the meshed area having a diameter of approximately 2.5mm. Usual grid materials are copper, molybdenum, gold or platinum. This grid is placed into the sample holder, which is paired with the {{specimen stage}}. A wide variety of designs of stages and holders exist, depending upon the type of experiment being performed. In addition to 3.05mm grids, 2.3mm grids are sometimes, if rarely, used. These grids were particularly used in the mineral sciences where a large degree of tilt can be required and where specimen material may be extremely rare. Electron transparent specimens have a thickness usually less than 100nm, but this value depends on the accelerating voltage.|$|E
