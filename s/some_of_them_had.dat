Small holes all around the cheek guards and the helmet's lower edge were used for the attachment of internal padding. Other types of bronze helmets were also used. During the late Mycenaean period, additional types were also used such as horned helmets made of strips of leather.|$|E
5|$|In August 1792, {{a second}} {{convention}} {{was held in}} Pittsburgh to discuss resistance to the whiskey tax. This meeting was more radical than the first convention; moderates such as Brackenridge and Findley were not in attendance. Future Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin was one moderate who did attend, to his later regret. A militant group known as the Mingo Creek Association dominated the convention and issued radical demands. As <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> done in the American Revolution, they raised liberty poles, formed committees of correspondence, and {{took control of the}} local militia. They created an extralegal court and discouraged lawsuits for debt collection and foreclosures.|$|E

5|$|Bezen Kadoudal {{was placed}} under the {{supervision}} of Sicherheitsdienst Obersturmbannführer Hartmut Pulmer, and under the military command of Hauptscharführer Hans Grimm, its headquarters were located at 7 Rue de Vincennes, Rennes. Its initial 33 members were recruited from a variety of Breton nationalist organizations, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> already served in collaborationist militias. Terms of enlistment specified that it will only engage French opponents within the borders of Brittany. On 15 December, Bezen Kadoudal was renamed into Bezen Perrot (Perrot Unit), in honor of the recently assassinated Breton nationalist Jean-Marie Perrot, German documents record it under the name Bretonische Waffenverband der SS. At the top of its strength the unit numbered 80 members the pseudonyms of 65 of whom are recorded. Pseudonyms were used {{in order to protect the}} members' identities. It was headed by Lainé, and his assistants, field commander Ange Péresse and Jean Chanteau, the latter being responsible for intelligence.|$|E
5|$|By the Late Middle Ages, {{the royal}} touch {{had become an}} {{integral}} part of the coronation of the French monarch at Reims Cathedral. The rite included the anointing of the king's hands, which was believed to confer on him the ability to cure. The coronation and anointing were immediately followed by a journey to Corbeny, the site of the shrine of Saint Marcouf (d. 558), patron saint of scrofulous people. After the pilgrimage was completed, the newly crowned king was deemed to possess the sacred power of touch. On his deathbed, Philip IV (r. 1285–1314) reportedly instructed his son and heir, Louis X (r. 1314–1316), about healing scrofula by touch. Philip VI (r. 1328–1350), the first Valois king, sought to demonstrate that he shared the thaumaturgic powers of his sovereign cousins and ancestors, thus proving himself as their rightful heir. He touched 35 people between 1 January and 30 June 1337; <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> come from Brittany, Brabant and Vivarais.|$|E
5|$|During the Achaemenid period (550–330 BC), the Sogdians {{lived as}} a nomadic people {{much like the}} {{neighboring}} Yuezhi, who spoke Bactrian, an Indo-Iranian language closely related to Sogdian, and were already engaging in overland trade. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> also gradually settled the land to engage in agriculture. Similar to how the Yuezhi offered tributary gifts of jade to the emperors of China, the Sogdians are recorded in Persian records as submitting precious gifts of lapis lazuli and carnelian to Darius I, the Persian king of kings. Although the Sogdians were at times independent and living outside the boundaries of large empires, they never formed a great empire of their own like the Yuezhi, who established the Kushan Empire (30–375 AD) of Central and South Asia.|$|E

5|$|In case {{a doctor}} was needed, Major Charles H. Morhouse was summoned from Bataan to {{accompany}} the party. The remaining thirteen were members of MacArthur's staff. They were loyal and experienced, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> been with MacArthur for years. Creating a new staff in Australia would have taken time, while taking his existing one would enable him to commence work soon after arrival in Australia. They would be more valuable there than in the Philippines. Sutherland included two of his own men: his assistant, Lieutenant Colonel Francis H. Wilson, and his stenographer, Master Sergeant Paul P. Rogers. Promoted from private that day, Rogers was the only enlisted man on the list, which he typed. A number of men gave him letters to post.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} groups of Black Hebrews, the Church of God and Saints of Christ, was founded in Kansas in 1896, but it {{retained}} elements of a messianic connection to Jesus. During the following decades, many more Black Hebrew congregations were established, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> no connection to Christianity. After World War I, for example, Wentworth Arthur Matthew, an immigrant from Saint Kitts, founded a Black Hebrew congregation in Harlem, claiming descent from the ancient Israelites. He called it the Commandment Keepers of the Living God. Similar groups selected elements of Judaism and adapted them within a structure {{similar to that of}} the Black church. He incorporated it in 1930 and moved the congregation to Brooklyn, where he later founded the Israelite Rabbinical Seminary, where Black Hebrew rabbis have been educated and ordained.|$|E
5|$|The chief tax {{imposed by}} Charles was a feudal levy known as ship money, which proved even more unpopular, and lucrative, than {{poundage}} and tonnage before it. Previously, collection of ship money had been authorised only during wars, and only on coastal regions. Charles, however, {{argued that there}} was no legal bar to collecting the tax for defence during peacetime and throughout the whole of the kingdom. Ship money, paid directly to the Treasury of the Navy, provided between £150,000 to £200,000 annually between 1634 and 1638, after which yields declined. Opposition to ship money steadily grew, but the 12 common law judges of England declared that the tax was within the king's prerogative, though <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> reservations. The prosecution of John Hampden for non-payment in 1637–38 provided a platform for popular protest, and the judges only found against Hampden by the narrow margin of 7–5.|$|E

5|$|Alarmed by the {{establishment}} of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, which also signified the end of Berlin's avant-garde, he merged his activities as an art promoter with the cause of anti-fascism, and {{was close to the}} French Communist Party (PCF). In 1936, Richter recalled, he published a series of photographs secretly taken by Kurt Schwitters in Hanover, works which documented the destruction of Nazi propaganda by the locals, ration stamp with reduced quantities of food, and other hidden aspects of Hitler's rule. After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he briefly left France and joined the Republican forces. Alongside Soviet reporter Ilya Ehrenburg, Tzara visited Madrid, which was besieged by the Nationalists (see Siege of Madrid). Upon his return, he published the collection of poems Midis gagnés ("Conquered Southern Regions"). <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> previously been printed in the brochure Les poètes du monde défendent le peuple espagnol ("The Poets of the World Defend the Spanish People", 1937), which was edited by two prominent authors and activists, Nancy Cunard and the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda. Tzara had also signed Cunard's June 1937 call to intervention against Francisco Franco. Reportedly, he and Nancy Cunard were romantically involved.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the {{familiar}} Paris salons, Offenbach quietly shifted the emphasis of his work from being a cellist who also composed to being a composer who played the cello. He had already published many compositions, and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> sold well, but now he began to write, perform and produce musical burlesques {{as part of his}} salon presentations. He amused the comtesse de Vaux's 200 guests with a parody of Félicien David's currently fashionable Le désert, and in April 1846 gave a concert at which seven operatic items of his own composition were premiered before an audience that included leading music critics. After some encouragement and some temporary setbacks, he seemed on the verge of breaking into theatrical composition when Paris was convulsed by the 1848 revolution, which swept Louis Philippe from the throne and led to serious bloodshed in the streets of the capital. Offenbach hastily took Hérminie and their recently born daughter to join his family in Cologne. He thought it politic to revert temporarily to the name Jacob.|$|E
