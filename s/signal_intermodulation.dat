40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} an {{extension}} of the Rosen-stark’s linear model of an amplifier to a nonlinear one for the purpose of performing nonlinear distortion analysis. Contrary to an approach using phasors, our method uses the Volterra series. Relying upon the linear model mentioned above, we define first a set of the so-called amplifier’s constitutive equations in an op-erator form. Then, we expand operators using the Volterra series truncated to the first three components. This leads to getting two representations in the time domain, called in-network and input-output type descriptions of an amplifier. Afterwards, both of these representations are transferred into the multi-frequency domains. Their usefulness in calculations of any nonlinear distortion measure as, for example, harmonic, intermodulation, and/or cross-modulation distortion is demonstrated. Moreover, we show that they allow a simple calculation of the so-called nonlinear transfer functions in any topology as, for example, of cascade and feedback structures and their combinations occurring in single-, two-, and three-stage amplifiers. Examples of such calculations are given. Finally in this paper, we comment on usage of such notions as nonlinear <b>signals,</b> <b>intermodulation</b> nonlinearity, and on identification of transfer function poles and zeros lying on the frequency axis with related real-valued frequencies.

Thus, it may be expected that such missions will be further developed in the near future especially in fields where similar experiments by purely Earth-based means are impracticable.

40|$|The {{world of}} {{information}} is literally at one’s fingertips, allowing access to previously unimaginable amounts of data, thanks to advances in wireless communication. The growing demand for high speed data has necessitated theuse of wider bandwidths, and wireless technologies such as Multiple-InputMultiple-Output (MIMO) have been adopted to increase spectral efficiency. These advanced communication technologies require sophisticated signal processing, often leading to higher power consumption and reduced battery life. Therefore, increasing energy efficiency of baseband hardware for MIMO signal processing has become extremely vital. High Quality of Service (QoS) requirements invariably lead to {{a larger number of}} computations and a higherpower dissipation. However, recognizing the dynamic nature of the wirelesscommunication medium in which only some channel scenarios require complexsignal processing, and that not all situations call for high data rates, allowsthe use of an adaptive channel aware signal processing strategy to provide adesired QoS. Information such as interference conditions, coherence bandwidthand Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) can be used to reduce algorithmic computations in favorable channels. Hardware circuits which run these algorithmsneed flexibility and easy reconfigurability to switch between multiple designsfor different parameters. These parameters can be used to tune the operations of different components in a receiver based on feedback from the digitalbaseband. This dissertation focuses on the optimization of digital basebandcircuitry of receivers which use feedback to trade power and performance. Aco-optimization approach, where designs are optimized starting from the algorithmic stage through the hardware architectural stage to the final circuitimplementation is adopted to realize energy efficient digital baseband hardwarefor mobile 4 G devices. These concepts are also extended to the next generation 5 G systems where the energy efficiency of the base station is improved. This work includes six papers that examine digital circuits in MIMO wireless receivers. Several key blocks in these receiver include analog circuits thathave residual non-linearities, leading to <b>signal</b> <b>intermodulation</b> and distortion. Paper-I introduces a digital technique to detect such non-linearities and calibrate analog circuits to improve signal quality. The concept of a digital nonlinearity tuning system developed in Paper-I is implemented and demonstratedin hardware. The performance of this implementation is tested with an analogchannel select filter, and results are presented in Paper-II. MIMO systems suchas the ones used in 4 G, may employ QR Decomposition (QRD) processors tosimplify the implementation of tree search based signal detectors. However,the small form factor of the mobile device increases spatial correlation, whichis detrimental to signal multiplexing. Consequently, a QRD processor capableof handling high spatial correlation is presented in Paper-III. The algorithm and hardware implementation are optimized for carrier aggregation, which increases requirements on signal processing throughput, leading to higher powerdissipation. Paper-IV presents a method to perform channel-aware processingwith a simple interpolation strategy to adaptively reduce QRD computationcount. Channel properties such as coherence bandwidth and SNR are used toreduce multiplications by 40 % to 80 %. These concepts are extended to usetime domain correlation properties, and a full QRD processor for 4 G systemsfabricated in 28 nm FD-SOI technology is presented in Paper-V. The designis implemented with a configurable architecture and measurements show thatcircuit tuning results in a highly energy efficient processor, requiring 0. 2 nJ to 1. 3 nJ for each QRD. Finally, these adaptive channel-aware signal processingconcepts are examined in the scope of the next generation of communicationsystems. Massive MIMO systems increase spectral efficiency by using a largenumber of antennas at the base station. Consequently, the signal processingat the base station has a high computational count. Paper-VI presents a configurable detection scheme which reduces this complexity by using techniquessuch as selective user detection and interpolation based signal processing.

The frequency coverage of receivers of this type is typically in the range of 500 kHz to 30 MHz. Communication receivers are suited for operation near powerful transmitting facilities and so must have good internal shielding, and effective front-end filtering.

Introduction Historically, analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) have been characterized for static and dynamic error performance using ramp and sinewave test signals respectively.

5000|$|The adjacent-channel {{interference}} which receiver A experiences from a transmitter B {{is the sum}} of {{the power}} that B emits into A's channel—known as the [...] "unwanted emission", and represented by the ACLR (Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio)—and the power that A picks up from B's channel, which is represented by the ACS (Adjacent Channel Selectivity). B emitting power into A's channel is called adjacent-channel leakage (unwanted emissions). It occurs for two reasons. First, because RF filters require a roll-off, and do not eliminate a signal completely. Second, due to intermodulation in B's amplifiers, which cause the transmitted spectrum to spread beyond what was intended. Therefore, B emits some power in the adjacent channel which is picked up by A. A receives some emissions from B's channel due to the roll off of A's selectivity filters. Selectivity filters are designed to [...] "select" [...] a channel.
