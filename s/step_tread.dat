Nevertheless she was as keenly alive and watchful of his every {{movement}} and gesture as if she had hung enchanted on his lips. The unerring way with which he pursued a viewless, undeviating path through those trackless woods, his quick reconnaissance of certain trees or openings, his mute inspection of some almost imperceptible footprint of bird or beast, his critical examination of certain plants which he plucked and deposited in his deerskin haversack, were not lost on the quick-witted woman. As they gradually changed the clear, unencumbered aisles of the central woods for a more tangled undergrowth, Teresa felt that subtle admiration which culminates in imitation, and simulating perfectly the <b>step,</b> <b>tread,</b> and easy swing of her companion, followed so accurately his lead that she won a gratified exclamation from him when their goal was reached--a broken, blackened shaft, splintered by long-forgotten lightning, in the centre of a tangled carpet of wood-clover.|$|E

40|$|Although it {{is likely}} that foveal {{information}} on treads provides important sensory cues for stair walking, it is unclear how gaze stabilization on treads contribute to gait control on stairs. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the extent to which (i) stair walking depends on foveal information on <b>stepped</b> <b>treads,</b> (ii) fixated treads correspond to future foot landing locations, and (iii) the distance looked ahead varies with stepping distance. Gaze and foot position was monitored from six healthy young adults when they ascended and descended a 10 tread long staircase, taking the stairs one or two treads at a time. The results showed that 55 - 68 % of the total fixation time was aimed at treads, and that tread edges were fixated more intensively during stair descent (69 % of the total time spent fixating treads) than during stair ascent (48 %). A substantial 28 - 34 % of the <b>stepped</b> <b>treads</b> was never fixated and, when the staircase was taken two treads a time, approximately 35 % of the fixated <b>treads</b> was never <b>stepped</b> on. Subjects fixated 3. 5 - 4. 5 treads ahead in both stepping conditions, but when the staircase was taken 2 <b>treads</b> a time, <b>stepped</b> <b>treads</b> were fixated shorter ahead (2. 7 - 2. 9 treads) than treads that were not stepped (3. 4 - 4. 1 treads). These results provide new insights into the visual control of stair walking, and suggest that the stabilization of gaze on treads is not used solely to guide foot placement, but may serve other purposes as well, e. g., to facilitate postural control on the staircase.

40|$|Accurately {{specifying the}} {{relationship}} between basal drag on a hard, rough glacier bed and sliding speed is a long-standing and central challenge in glaciology. Drag on a rigid bed consisting of <b>steps</b> with linear <b>treads</b> inclined upglacier—a good idealization for the bedrock morphology of some hard-bedded glaciers—has been considered in sliding theories but never studied empirically. Balancing forces parallel to <b>step</b> <b>treads</b> indicates that drag should be independent of sliding speed and cavity size and set by the limit-equilibrium condition sometimes called Iken 2 ̆ 7 s bound. In this study we used a large ring-shear device to slide ice at its pressure melting temperature across a stepped bed, over a range of steady sliding speeds (29 – 348 [*]m[*]yr− 1), and under a steady effective pressure (500 [*]kPa). Contrary to expectation, drag decreased 42...|$|R

2500|$|An {{escalator}} is {{a moving}} staircase, a conveyor transport device for carrying people between floors of a building. Commonly found {{and used in}} shopping malls, department stores, airports, an escalator consists of a motor-driven chain of individual, linked steps that move up or down on tracks, allowing the <b>step</b> <b>treads</b> to remain horizontal. The escalator was invented in 1859 by Nathan Ames of Saugus, Massachusetts for an invention that he called [...] "Revolving Stairs". However, Ames' escalator was never built. The earliest form of a working escalator, patented in 1892 by Jesse W. Reno, was introduced as a new novelty ride at the Old Iron Pier at Coney Island, New York in 1896.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{modern world}} we live in, {{although}} offers us obvious benefits we enjoy every day, can also overwhelms us through efforts and sacrifices required from us. That is why tourism, which {{can be defined as}} a recreative period for most of us, is in continuous positive evolution and development. People feel the need to take, at least once per year, a few days, to leave behind the agitation of the cities they live and work in and leave in various places more or less by traveler <b>steps</b> <b>trodden.</b> Although many people choose renowned resorts that presents a comprehensive offer of services, the number of those who choose to spend their vacation in areas where natural environment was not compromised by tourism specific human activities increases from year to year.

40|$|Hill One is a wind-exposed, alpine {{environment}} in southern Tasmania. The prevailing wind-stream is westerly. However, high intensity south-westerly winds associated with frost events appear {{to control the}} patterning of fjaeldmark. These winds cause necrosis of prostrate Richea scoparia and cushion plants on their south-western side and induce migration of individual plants in a north-easterly direction. Fjaeldmark is confined to the exposed mountain summit and terrace and <b>step</b> <b>treads.</b> Mosaic cushion heath occurs in more exposed and poorly drained areas than other heath communities. The horizontally bedded sediments of Hill One have been worked by erosional and depositional agents into a complex morphology. Large terraces and non-sorted steps {{are likely to have}} formed from altiplanation processes, that is, differential erosion of interbedded sediments, with accumulation of erosional debris {{at the foot of the}} risers. Depositional lobes and erosional washout features are actively forming in localised areas of concentrated drainage. The distribution of plant communities is closely associated with rockiness, wind exposure and drainage...|$|R

50|$|Additions to {{the rear}} were {{constructed}} in the 1930s and the upper storey was converted from offices to living space. Also during the 1930s a partition wall between the two rear offices of the 1880s building was removed and some partition walls installed. These partitions were removed in the mid-1970s. In the late 1970s the upper storey reverted to office space with the removal of its kitchen and it has since been used for storage. In 1985 posts were added under the floor as the joists that spanned the full width of the building had sagged. During 1986-87 rotten floorboards on the ground level were replaced and loose plasterwork was repaired or replaced. Other repairs have included: reinstatement of the partition wall between the two offices; replacement of a window in the original rear wall with a reproduction; replacement of <b>step</b> <b>treads</b> in the cedar staircase; replacement of damaged and missing plaster cornice with replica cornice and replacement of the iron roof with ZINCALUME. The building's address to Reef Street, which gave {{the only means of}} accessing the rear of the building, has been retained.|$|R

Her heart beat violently, and she soon heard the door of Moses's room open, and then the old chamber-stairs gave forth those inconsiderate creaks and snaps that garrulous old stairs always will when anybody is desirous of making them accomplices in a night-secret. Mara rose, and undrawing her curtain, saw three men standing before the house, and saw Moses come out and join them. Quick as thought she threw on her clothes and wrapping her little form in a dark cloak, with a hood, followed them out. She kept {{at a safe distance}} behind them,--so far back as just to keep them in sight. They never looked back, and seemed to say but little till they approached the edge of that deep belt of forest which shrouds so large a portion of the island. She hurried along, now nearer to them lest they should be lost to view in the deep shadows, while they went on crackling and plunging through the dense underbrush.|$|R
