40|$|Introduction: Chronic {{myeloid leukemia}} (CML) {{is a common}} {{myeloproliferative}} disorder. Based on clinical and hematological parameters, two prognostic scoring systems, i. e., Hasford and <b>Sokal</b> <b>index</b> scoring systems are available to predict survival duration of CML patients on imatinib therapy. Aims and Objectives: Our study′s objective is to compare Hasford score with <b>Sokal</b> <b>index</b> for the prognostication of de novo CML patients on therapy and find out new prognostic markers. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective study. The study population comprised 66 patients who were followed up for 60 months. For each patient, at presentation, scoring was performed as per Hasford and <b>Sokal</b> <b>index</b> and Philadelphia chromosome analysis {{was carried out by}} conventional cytogenetics. Thereafter, hematological parameters were assessed 3 monthly and conventional cytogenetics was done yearly. Results: Out of these 66 patients, the number of patients belonging to low, intermediate and high risk categories are 21, 33 and 12 respectively by Hasford score and 12, 32 and 22 respectively by <b>Sokal</b> <b>index.</b> Eight patients, who had been categorized into high risk group by <b>Sokal</b> <b>index</b> but intermediate risk group by Hasford score, have shown better survival possibility as monitored by hematological and cytogenetic parameters. Ten cases, categorized into intermediate risk group by <b>Sokal</b> <b>index</b> but low risk group by Hasford score, is doing well till date. Conclusions: This study shows that Hasford score predicts survival of the patients better than <b>Sokal</b> <b>index.</b> However, multicentric study over a large population is needed to give the final verdict...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{coincidence}} of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and achondroplastic dwarfism is very rare. A 40 -year {{old man with}} achondroplastic dwarfism was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia in blastic phase with a <b>Sokal</b> <b>index</b> of 1. 34. Standart dose imatinib treatment was immediately started after the diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Mobilization of Philadelphia {{chromosome}} (Ph) negative blood progenitors was attempted in 23 {{newly diagnosed}} {{chronic myeloid leukaemia}} (CML) patients using a regimen of cyclophosphamide (CY) 5 g/m² and rHUG-CSF 150 μg/m² daily. This regimen was well tolerated with no major adverse events reported. More than 2 × 10 ⁶/kg CD 34 ⁺ cells were collected in 21 patients (91 %). Predominantly Ph-negative mobilization (0 – 25 % Ph-positive) was seen in 30 % of cases overall and was confined to patients with a Sokal prognostic score < 1 (7 / 11 with Sokal score < 1; 0 / 12 with Sokal score ≥ 1). Within the low <b>Sokal</b> <b>index</b> group, a low WBC count pre-mobilization and a low WBC nadir both correlated strongly with Ph-negative mobilization (P = 0. 006 and 0. 02 respectively). Five of 19 patients receiving at least 6 months of Roferon A therapy post mobilization achieved a major cytogenetic response; all five patients were Ph-negative mobilizers. Therefore CML patients {{can be divided into}} a good-prognosis group in whom predominantly Ph-negative progenitors can be mobilized using a regimen of moderate intensity if haematological control is achieved pre-mobilization, and a poor-prognosis group for whom predominantly Ph-positive cells are mobilized with this regimen regardless of haematological control...|$|E
30|$|Pairwise genetic {{distances}} between rice cultivars were calculated as implemented in Darwin 6.0 (Perrier et al. 2003), {{by using the}} <b>Sokal</b> & Michener <b>index</b> and 10, 000 bootstrap replicates. Then we obtained a neighbour-joining (NJ) tree, which robustness was assessed again by 10, 000 replicate bootstrap analyses.|$|R
40|$|Alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN) {{therapy is}} an {{effective}} agent in early chronic phase (ECP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), achieving hematologic control in the majority and major cytogenetic response (MCR) (reduction in Ph' +ve metaphases to < 35 %) in a substantial minority. Currently no pretreatment markers exist to ascertain likelihood of meaningful response. The site of breakpoint in M-bcr and relationship to prognosis is controversial. Studies have been hampered by variation in definition of breakpoint and difference in treatment protocols. In this study of ECP CML patients, Southern analysis and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) {{were used to determine}} breakpoint location. Patients received (alpha-IFN (9 x 106 units/day) and dose-adjusted hydroxyurea (HU) to maintain granulocyte count between 1. 0 - 2. 0 x 109 /l for 6 months or more. Twelve of 31 patients entered on the study achieved a MCR. The <b>Sokal</b> <b>index</b> did not predict for cytogenetic response to ?-IFN. Eight of 11 patients with 5 ' breakpoint achieved MCR compared to only four of 20 patients with 3 ' breakpoint (P = 0. 007). These results suggest site of M-bcr rearrangement may be predictive of response to alpha-IFN therapy. If verified by further study, this may allow more appropriate use of alpha-IFN with respect to other modalities such as allogeneic transplant...|$|E
40|$|Imatinib mesylate (IM), 400 mg daily, is the {{standard}} treatment of Philadelphia-positive (Ph(+)) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Preclinical data and results of single-arm studies raised the suggestion that better results could be achieved with a higher dose. To investigate whether the systematic use of a higher dose of IM could lead to better results, 216 patients with Ph(+) CML at high risk (HR) according to the <b>Sokal</b> <b>index</b> {{were randomly assigned to}} receive IM 800 mg or 400 mg daily, as front-line therapy, for at least 1 year. The CCgR rate at 1 year was 64 % and 58 % for the high-dose arm and for {{the standard}}-dose arm, respectively (P =. 435). No differences were detectable in the CgR at 3 and 6 months, in the molecular response rate at any time, {{as well as in the}} rate of other events. Twenty-four (94 %) of 25 patients who could tolerate the full 800 -mg dose achieved a CCgR, and only 4 (23 %) of 17 patients who could tolerate less than 350 mg achieved a CCgR. This study does not support the extensive use of high-dose IM (800 mg daily) front-line in all CML HR patients. This trial was registered at www. clinicaltrials. gov as #NCT 0051448...|$|E
