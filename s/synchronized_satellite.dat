40|$|Abstract: Changes in {{the spatial}} {{distributions}} of vegetation {{across the globe}} are routinely monitored by satellite remote sensing, in which the reflectance spectra over land surface areas are measured with spatial and temporal resolutions that depend on the satellite instrumentation. The use of multiple <b>synchronized</b> <b>satellite</b> sensors permits long-term monitoring with high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, differences in the spatial resolution of images collected by different sensors can introduce systematic biases, called scaling effects, into the biophysical retrievals. This study investigates the mechanism by which the scaling effects distort normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This study focused on the monotonicity of the area-averaged NDVI {{as a function of}} the spatial resolution. A monotonic relationship was proved analytically by using the resolution transformmodel proposed in this study in combination with a two-endmember linear mixture model. The monotonicity allowed the inherent uncertainties introduced by the scaling effects (error bounds) to be explicitly determined by averaging the retrievals at the extrema of the resolutions. Error bounds could not be estimated, on the other hand, for non-monotonic relationships. Numerical simulations were conducted to demonstrate the monotonicity o...|$|E
40|$|The SEASAT-A {{synthetic}} aperture radar, the first spaceborne SAR, utilized an all solid state RF signal synthesizer and L-band transmitter {{to drive a}} corporately fed flat plate array. The RF signal synthesizer generated a linear FM ""CHIRP'' waveform and provided stable CW reference signals used to upconvert the received signal to a unified S-band downlink channel, and to <b>synchronize</b> <b>satellite</b> control logic. The transmitter generated 1200 watts peak RF power (66 watts average) at a center frequency of 1. 275 GHz from 354 watts of DC prime power. Linear FM CHIRP swept symmetrically around the center frequency with a bandwidth of 19. 05 MHz and a pulse duration of 33. 8 sec. Pulse repetition rate was variable from 1647 to 1944 pps. These transmitter signal parameters combined with the flat plate 34 x 7. 5 ft aperture at an orbital altitude of 498 miles and a look angle 20 deg off nadir gave the SAR an 85 foot resolution over a 15. 5 mile wide swath...|$|R
50|$|It is {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{said that the}} user location is {{at the intersection of}} three spheres. While simpler to visualize, this is only the case if the receiver has a clock <b>synchronized</b> with the <b>satellite</b> clocks (i.e., the receiver measures true ranges to the satellites rather than range differences). There are significant performance benefits to the user carrying a clock <b>synchronized</b> with the <b>satellites.</b> Foremost is that only three satellites are needed to compute a position solution. If this were part of the GPS system concept so that all users needed to carry a synchronized clock, then a smaller number of satellites could be deployed.

40|$|Collision {{analysis}} and mitigation performed for the QB 50 mission. The {{aim of this}} thesis report is to identify which mitigation strategies are most suitable for a network of uncontrollable satellites. Furthermore, {{the aim is to}} set-out a method to determine the collision probability for a network of uncontrollable satellites, and identify the parameters that influence the collision probability. These methods are applied to the QB 50 mission; to find a scenario where the collision probability is lowest. An alternative method is developed by the author to calculate the Gaussian probability, which is applicable for small satellites. As the size of the satellites decreases relative to the error ellipsoid, the probability at a certain moment in time becomes more equal to the probability {{at the center of the}} combined sphere (assuming spherical satellites). Now, instead of dealing with a cumbersome volume integral through the combined error ellipsoid, the collision probability can be approached by a line-integral times the area of the combined satellites’ bodies. Four ideal deployment angles for the QB 50 mission were found located in a plane of zero pitch and at yaw angles of 34 ?, 146 ?, 248 ?, 326 ? measured from velocity vector of the upperstage. Deploying at zero pitch has the effect that the phase between the cross-track and radial separation is half the orbital period. This has the consequence that, when either the cross-track separation is zero, the radial separation has its maximum and visa versa. This can also be identified as (anti-) parallel alignment of relative eccentricity and inclination vectors. Synchronization of the motion at times where the deployment is half or equal to the orbital period should be avoided. For these satellites the amplitude radial and cross-track separations are small. Furthermore, the relative perturbations between these satellites is large, decreasing the offset of the radial motion. This causes the radial and cross-track separation reach zero at equal time. <b>Synchronized</b> <b>satellite</b> increase the collision probability significantly. Both Patera’s method and the line-integral method are applied to a full-scale simulation for the QB 50 mission. Multiple scenario’s are chosen for the full-scale simulation. The two scenario’s with the lowest probability are sequential deployment at one of the ideal angles and alternating deployment between two opposite ideal angles. These fall below the threshold value of 10 ? 4, a value used by the German Space Operations Center (GSOC). Space Systems EngineeringSpace FlightAerospace Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|The CERN-LNGS {{time-of-flight}} experiment (of neutrinos) {{represents a}} significant {{challenge to the}} special theory of relativity {{and needs to be}} addressed either as a source of new physics, or as an un-remedied experimental error. There have been several attempts at using new physics to explain the results, while a few unpublished results exist that address the experimental errors that might lead to the same result. In particular, a recent calculation by van Elburg [2] indicates a potential flaw in the OPERA experiment [1] that represents a source of potential error, i. e., that the motion of the <b>synchronizing</b> GPS <b>satellites</b> causes the clocks to go out of synchronization. Unfortunately, there are several misconceptions about how GPS satellites work that pervade the paper. In addition, the principal contention of the paper, that the experiment is being timed by a moving clock is not substantiated in the analysis.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the outcomes of}} my Ph. D. course in telecommunications engineering. The focus of my research has been on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and in particular {{on the design of}} aiding schemes operating both at position and physical level and the evaluation of their feasibility and advantages. Assistance techniques at the position level are considered to enhance receiver availability in challenging scenarios where satellite visibility is limited. Novel positioning techniques relying on peer-to-peer interaction and exchange of information are thus introduced. More specifically two different techniques are proposed: the Pseudorange Sharing Algorithm (PSA), based on the exchange of GNSS data, that allows to obtain coarse positioning where the user has scarce satellite visibility, and the Hybrid approach, which also permits to improve the accuracy of the positioning solution. At the physical level, aiding schemes are investigated to improve the receiver’s ability to <b>synchronize</b> with <b>satellite</b> signals. An innovative code acquisition strategy for dual-band receivers, the Cross-Band Aiding (CBA) technique, is introduced to speed-up initial synchronization by exploiting the exchange of time references between the two bands. In addition vector configurations for code tracking are analyzed and their feedback generation process thoroughly investigated. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{recent years}} {{the concept of a}} {{constellation}} (formation flying) has become popular because of its potential to achieve coordinated action for remote sensing missions and mission capabilities in the long term. A constellation is a group of similar <b>satellites</b> <b>synchronized</b> to orbit the Earth optimally. Some of the advantages of the nano-satellites constellations comparing to the big satellites are: their performance, flexibility and ability to perform coordinated and distributed measurements. In spite of that, placing a satellite in orbit improperly designed can greatly reduce the effectiveness of this satellite in the accomplishment of its objectives. In addition, the inability to maintain the satellite on its orbit can cause disastrous effects on his mission. Considering all these aspects, the designs of the orbit and the orbit maintenance {{have a significant impact on}} the success of the satellite constellation's mission...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{empirical}} correction of sky coordinates of X-ray photons obtained with the XIS aboard the Suzaku satellite {{to improve the}} source position accuracy and restore the point-spread function (PSF). The XIS images {{are known to have}} an uncertainty in position of up to 1 arcmin, and to show considerable degradations of the PSF. These problems are caused by a drifting of the satellite attitude due to thermal distortion of the side panel 7, where the attitude control system is mounted. We found that the position error averaged over a pointing observation can be largely reduced by using the relation between the deviation of the source position in the DETX direction and the ecliptic latitude of the pointing target. We parameterized the wobbling of the source position <b>synchronized</b> with the <b>satellite</b> orbital period with temperatures of onboard radiators and elapsed time since the night-day transition of the spacecraft. We developed software, aeattcor, to correct the image drift using these parameters, and applied it to 27 point-source images. We show that the radius of the 90 % error circle of the source position was reduced to 19 arcsec and the PSF was sharpened. These improvements have enhanced the scientific capability of the Suzaku XIS. Comment: 8 pages, 9 figures, the published version is available by the end of 2008 from [URL]...|$|R
40|$|With multi-antenna <b>synchronized</b> global {{navigation}} <b>satellite</b> system (GNSS) receivers, the single difference (SD) between two antennas {{is able to}} eliminate both satellite and receiver clock error, thus it becomes necessary to reconsider the equivalency problem between the SD and double difference (DD) models. In this paper, we quantitatively compared the formal uncertainties and dispersions between multiple SD models and the DD model, and also carried out static and kinematic short baseline experiments. The theoretical and experimental results show that under a non-common clock scheme the SD and DD model are equivalent. Under a common clock scheme, if we estimate stochastic uncalibrated phase delay (UPD) parameters every epoch, this SD model is still equivalent to the DD model, but if we estimate only one UPD parameter for all epochs or {{take it as a}} known constant, the SD (here called SD 2) and DD models are no longer equivalent. For the vertical component of baseline solutions, the formal uncertainties of the SD 2 model are two times smaller than those of the DD model, and the dispersions of the SD 2 model are even more than twice smaller than those of the DD model. In addition, to obtain baseline solutions, the SD 2 model requires a minimum of three satellites, while the DD model requires a minimum of four satellites, which makes the SD 2 more advantageous in attitude determination under sheltered environments...|$|R
40|$|Possible {{connections}} between the physical properties of Near-Earth Asteroids (NEA) and their orbital evolution were explored, with emphasis on binary asteroids. Our main starting hypothesis, suggested from the observations, was that the NEA population contains considerably higher percent of binaries compared to the Main Belt. The simulation covered simultaneously both orbital evolution and evolution of physical properties, which is the main improvement {{in comparison to the}} previous researches of this kind. Physical evolution due to tidal forces and collision/disruption events was described with TREESPH hydrocode. The results show typical evolution paths of some types of NEA: asteroids with a <b>satellite,</b> <b>synchronized</b> binaries, single fast rotators, double asteroids. The two latter types and their physical properties match closely to some observed NEA, while the two former ones have not been detected in observational practice. We conjecture that this is partly due to selection effects of current observational techniques but partly also because some of them are likely to evolve into different types of objects (e. g. single slow rotators) through the processes we have not taken into account in our simulation. The total percentage of binaries among NEA can be estimated to 12 %. We have to notice, however, that more detailed simulations, performed for longer time spans, are needed to confirm our results.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this paper is to control and {{synchronize}} sphere-shaped spacecrafts in a leader-follower synchronization scheme. In order to achieve this objective, a nonlinear mathematical model of the vehicles has been developed. The design is based on rigid body dynamics where the vessel is actuated by means of three orthogonally mounted reaction wheels. The attitude dynamics is derived using Euler parameters. In the pursuit of reaching the main goal of controlling and <b>synchronizing</b> the <b>satellites,</b> it is natural to rst develop control algorithms for single vehicle control. A sliding mode controller and a backstepping controller have been derived for this matter, and are compared for optimality. Both controllers are based on nonlinear control theory and are designed to control the angular velocity of the satellite. The system in combination with both the controllers is proven to be asymptotically stable. Due to cases where the spacecraft does not have angular velocity measurements, an estimator for the angular velocity is derived. Using LaSalle's theorem, asymptotic stability is proven for the observer in the time-invariant case, while Matrosov's theorem is utilized for system explicitly dependent on time. For operational assignments where it is not sufficient with only one <b>satellite,</b> a <b>synchronizing</b> scheme for several satellites has been proposed. The scheme is based on a leader-follower synchronization design, and is derived assuming that none of the satellites are equipped with angular velocity measurements. It is therefore possible to implement and utilize the nonlinear observer for angular velocity estimation in each vehicle. The controllers are designed in a similar manner for both the leader and the follower using backstepping control. The leader is set to follow an arbitrarily smooth trajectory, while the follower's objective is to track the leader's attitude, given by measurements and estimations. The various systems are tested in a lab setup with the AUVSAT. The AUVSAT is a sphere shaped, autonomous underwater satellite actuated by means of three orthogonally reaction wheels. The experiments are performed when the AUVSAT is submerged in a water tank, making it possible to emulate a gravity free environment equal to what a satellite traveling in space is experiencing. The AUVSAT build up is presented where hardware and software components are chosen with respect to simplicity, cost and space restrictions. Several experiments are carried out using the AUVSAT to evaluate the performance of the controllers, observer and the synchronization scheme. For all cases, the system tracks a time-varying sinusoidal reference signal in addition to a squareshaped sequence. In this way, one can truly validate transient responses, steady-state and tracking maneuvers to determine the performance of the various systems. The experiments show that the sliding mode controller and backstepping controller works quite similar and with a satisfactorily behavior throughout the experiments. However, there are some lack of performance of the combined observer and controller system when tracking the sinusoidal time-varying reference. In the synchronization scheme, the leader follows the desired trajectory and the follower tracks the leader's attitude to some extent. Comments on the results are presented in addition to proposed strategies and thoughts on how to improve the overall performance of the various systems. </p...|$|R
