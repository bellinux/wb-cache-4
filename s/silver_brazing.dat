Magnesium silicide is one such material that is of interest for improved devices which can provide increased efficiencies by withstanding far higher temperatures. Within this report, {{progress has been made}} in achieving ohmic contacts for high-performance tin-antimony doped magnesium silicide and higher manganese silicide. To achieve this, a lab scale prototyping and characterisation facility was designed and tested. Furthermore, a COMSOL model was developed for module prototyping verification and has been validated using empirical data. In addition, to achieve the fabrication of a prototype module a joining process is developed for pre-contacted co-sintered antimony doped magnesium silicide and undoped higher manganese silicide. Moreover, assembly and characterisation of a prototype 7 -couple module is performed followed by its characterisation data being used to validate a COMSOL model. Results showed contact sheet resistances of 8. 58 ± 0. 61 μΩ. cm 2 and 32. 7 ± 0. 95 μΩ. cm 2 being achieved for <b>silver</b> <b>brazed</b> antimony doped magnesium silicide and undoped higher manganese silicide, respectively. Furthermore, the prototype module created within this study has a power density of 130. 29 mW/cm 2 under a 300 oC temperature differential. Moreover, barrier coating studies were additionally carried out for high figure of merit tin-antimony doped magnesium silicide and undoped higher manganese silicide investigating electrolytic plating, electroless plating, and sputter coating deposition techniques. Results demonstrated a sputter-coated nickel layer at a thickness of 1. 2 μm with a 300 nm titanium adhesion layer results in a contact sheet resistance of 467. 00 ± 8. 35 E μΩ. cm 2 and 17. 00 ± 0. 13 μΩ. cm 2 for <b>silver</b> <b>brazed</b> tin-antimony doped magnesium silicide and undoped higher manganese silicide, respectively. Furthermore, from the empirically verified COMSOL model a final COMSOL simulation is carried out with ideal values for the high-performance silicide material and a power density of 143 mW/cm 2 is calculated. These results show that improvement of the barrier layer can lead to a significantly more efficient device by incorporating higher performance, higher operating temperature materials, however with increasing dopant levels effective joining processes becomes increasingly difficult...|$|R

The research also involved testing the strength and structural properties of brazed joints made of these steels. The tests were conducted on filler metals (<b>silver</b> <b>brazing</b> alloys) B-Ag 68 CuSn- 730 / 755 (Ag 68 Cu 28 Sn 4) and B-Ag 65 CuSnNi- 740 / 767 (Ag 65 Cu 28 Sn 5 Ni 2) and also, for comparative purposes, on the filler metal B-Ag 72 Cu- 780 (Ag 272 according to PN-EN ISO 17672), most commonly applied in the vacuum brazing of high alloyed stainless steels.

50|$|As {{copper and}} nickel alloy {{with each other}} easily and have simple structures, the alloys are ductile and readily fabricated. Strength and {{hardness}} for each individual alloy is increased by cold working; they are not hardened by heat treatment. Joining of 90-10 (C70600) and 70-30 (C71500) is possible by both welding or brazing. They are both weldable {{by the majority of}} techniques, although autogenous (welding without weld consumables) or oxyacetylene methods are not recommended. The 70-30 rather than 90-10 weld consumables are normally preferred for both alloys and no after-welding heat treatment is required. They can also be welded directly to steel, providing a 65% nickel-copper weld consumable is used to avoid iron dilution effects. The C71640 alloy tends to be used as seamless tubing and expanded rather than welded into the tube plate. Brazing requires appropriate silver-base brazing alloys. However, great care must be taken to ensure that there are no stresses in the Cu-Ni being <b>silver</b> <b>brazed,</b> since any stress can cause intergranulary penetration of the brazing material, and severe stress cracking (see image). Thus, full annealing of any potential mechanical stress is necessary.|$|R

40|$|Diffusion bonding and brazing of high purity copper were {{investigated}} to develop procedures for joining precision machined copper components for the Next Linear Collider (NLC). Diffusion bonds were made over {{a range of}} temperatures from 400 °C to 1000 °C, under two different loading conditions [3. 45 kPa (0. 5 psi) and 3. 45 MPa (500 psi) ], and on two different diamond machined surface finishes. Brazes were made using pure silver, pure gold, and gold-nickel alloys, and different heating rates produced by both radiation and induction heating. Braze materials were applied by both physical vapor deposition (PVD) and conventional braze alloy shims. Results of the diffusion bonding experiments showed that bond strengths very near that of the copper base metal could be made at bonding temperatures of 700 °C or higher at 3. 45 MPa bonding pressure. At lower temperatures, only partial strength diffusion bonds could be made. At low bonding pressures (3. 45 kPa), full strength bonds were made at temperatures of 800 °C and higher, while no bonding (zero strength) was observed at temperatures of 700 °C and lower. Observations of the fracture surfaces of the diffusion bonded samples showed the effects of surface finish on the bonding mechanism. These observations clearly indicate that bonding began by point asperity contact, and flatter surfaces resulted in {{a higher percentage of}} bonded area under similar bonding conditions. Results of the brazing experiments indicated that pure silver worked very well for brazing under both conventional and high heating rate scenarios. Similarly, pure <b>silver</b> <b>brazed</b> well for both the PVD layers and the braze alloy shims. The gold and gold-containing brazes had problems, mainly due to the high diffusivity of gold in copper. These problems led to the necessity of overdriving the temperature to ensure melting, the presence of porosity in the joint, and very wide braze joints. Based on the overall findings of this study, a two-step joining method is proposed for fabricating the NLC structures. The structure would be assembled with pure <b>silver</b> <b>braze</b> inserts using a self-aligning step joint design, then the assembly would be vacuum diffusion bonded at 700 °C and 3. 45 MPa pressure to seal the critical inner portion of the assembly. Finally, during the same furnace cycle, the temperature would be increased to 800 °C in order to react the silver with the copper to form a liquid braze alloy that would join and seal the outer portion of the cells together...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} in situ the occurrence of corrosion in the soldering point areas between the wire, <b>silver</b> <b>brazing</b> and band in Haas expanders. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-four 7 - 12 -year-old patients who needed maxillary expansion with a Haas expander were randomly assigned to two groups of 17 individuals each, according to the oral hygiene protocol adopted during the orthodontic treatment: Group I (control), toothbrushing with a fluoride dentifrice and Group II (experimental), toothbrushing with the same dentifrice plus 0. 12 % chlorhexidine gluconate (Periogard®) mouthrinses twice a week. The appliances were removed after approximately 4 months. Fragments of the appliances containing a metallic band with a soldered wire were sectioned at random for examination by stereomicroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Data were analyzed statistically by Fisher's test at 5 % significance level. RESULTS: The analysis by optical microscopy revealed areas with color change suggestive of corrosion in the soldering point areas joining the band and the wire in all specimens of both groups, with no statistically significant difference between the groups (p= 1). The peaks of chemical elements (Ni, Fe, Cr, O, C and P) revealed by EDS were also similar in both groups. CONCLUSION: Color changes and peaks of chemical elements suggestive of corrosion were observed in the soldering point areas between the wire, <b>silver</b> <b>brazing</b> and band in both control and experimental groups, which indicate that the 0. 12 % chlorhexidine gluconate mouthrinses did not influence the occurrence of corrosion in situ...|$|E

A new testing technique (symmetric double shear testing) was proposed and successfully carried out for the characterization of full-scale braze joints. Mechanical testing was accompanied by scanning electron microscopy examination of microstructure. High temperature deformation and damage of the joints was uncovered to be influenced by both interfaces and matrix performance.

In particular, metal supported SOFCs consisting of metallic frames and substrates coated with plasma sprayed functional layers have shown an excellent stability concerning redox cycling. In order to provide sufficient power, these single cells have to be assembled to stacks. To prevent short-circuiting the frame of each cell has to be electrically insulated from the neighbouring one. For that purpose a ceramic coating is applied on each metal frame by thermal spraying before it is brazed to other stack components.

40|$|Diamond {{tools are}} {{increasingly}} gaining importance as cutting and drilling materials {{for a wide}} variety of industrial applications. Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) is the main ultrahard material commercially used in the oil and gas drilling industry. In this study, a reactive brazing process was developed to join polycrystalline diamond (PCD) to WC- 13 wt% Co, to form the cutter for fixed-cutter drill bit applications. Most nonmetals including polycrystalline diamond are not wet by and cannot easily be joined with conventional brazing alloys due to their chemical stability. The experimental approach was first to analyze the effect of adding an active metal (Ti, Zr, or V) to copper, silver, or a silver-copper eutectic alloy on the wettability of diamond and WC-Co substrates. Sessile drop tests were utilized to compare wettability between the liquid braze alloy and the substrate. The addition of Ti, Zr, and V decreased the apparent contact angle, which improved both the wetting and bonding behavior between braze alloy and diamond substrate. For all three alloy systems evaluated, all three base alloys (Cu, Ag, and Ag-Cu) with active metal additions (Ti, Zr, or V) exhibited good wettability on diamond and WC-Co substrates. Microstructural analysis of the diamond and WC-Co sessile drop samples was performed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to characterize the interfacial layers formed. Two different types of reactions were observed between the braze alloys and the WC-Co substrates: reduction and dissolution reactions. For the diamond sessile drop samples, only intermetallic solidification products were observed at the interface for the Ag-Cu eutectic based alloys with additions of 2 and 5 wt% Ti. SEM/EDS analysis revealed that the chemical changes at the interface between the braze alloy and diamond substrate were in agreement with the intermetallic solidification products predicted from the phase diagrams. Based on the Gibbs energies of formation for carbides, it is predicted that the formation of TiC is thermodynamically favored at the interface. However, no TiC reaction product was identified within the resolution of SEM/EDS analysis possibly because the TiC reaction layer is too thin. Based on the results of the wetting studies, an effort was made to optimize the shear strength of diamond brazed to WC-Co. This phase study was focused on the relationship between the braze alloy composition, the braze layer thickness, the brazing thermal cycle, the braze microstructures and the resulting joint mechanical properties. The average shear strength for Ag- 2 wt% Ti alloy was approximately constant in the braze thickness range of 0. 1 to 0. 2 mm. It was observed that the brazed samples failed in the <b>silver</b> <b>braze</b> layer. More visible cracking and larger cracks were observed on the surface region of diamond substrates of the joint thickness of 0. 2 mm for the Ag-Cu- 2 wt% Ti alloys. It is possible that thermal stresses generated from coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch resulted in the formation of interfacial cracks. The Ag-Cu eutectic alloy with addition of a 2 wt% Ti has the highest average shear strength of 95 MPa when the hold time is 30 minutes and the cooling rate is 5 °C/min...|$|R
