500|$|Most notably, Weizsäcker {{spoke of}} the danger of forgetting and {{distorting}} the past. [...] "There {{is no such thing as}} the guilt or innocence of an entire nation. Guilt is, like innocence, not collective but personal. There is discovered or concealed individual guilt. There is guilt which people acknowledge or deny. [...] All of us, whether guilty or not, whether young or old, must accept the past. We are all affected by the consequences and liable for it. [...] We Germans must look truth <b>straight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> – without embellishment and without distortion. [...] There can be no reconciliation without remembrance." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{includes}} four role-playing scenes. In the first, a man tells a girl {{that he will}} buy her a toy if she goes home with him. In the second, eight-year-old Natasha goes to her friend's house and finds that only her friend's father is home; after he intentionally spills water on her clothes, he tells her to take them off. The film cuts to Harris, who says, [...] "She should look him <b>straight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> {{and tell him to}} stop, go away". In the third scene, a group of older boys try to lure young children into their [...] "special club"; they lead one young boy to a secluded, wooded area and try to convince him to remove his clothes. In the last role-playing scene, Sophie's father offers her a secret bubble bath; afterwards, he tells her not to tell anyone because he would go to jail and it would be her fault.|$|E
2500|$|In his March 1845 inaugural address, President Polk {{quoted from}} the party platform, saying that the U.S. title to Oregon was [...] "clear and unquestionable". Tensions grew, with both sides moving to {{strengthen}} border fortifications in anticipation of war. Despite Polk's bold language, he was actually prepared to compromise, and had no real desire {{to go to war}} over Oregon. He believed that a firm stance would compel the British to accept a resolution agreeable to the United States. While meeting with Representative James A. Black on 4 January 1846, Polk stated that [...] "the only way to treat John Bull was to look him <b>straight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye...</b> if Congress faultered ... John Bull would immediately become arrogant and more grasping in his demands..." [...] But Polk's position on Oregon was not mere posturing: he genuinely believed that the U.S. had a legitimate claim to the entire region. He rejected British offers to settle the dispute through arbitration, fearing that no impartial third party could be found.|$|E

2500|$|According to the {{historian}} Chen Shou, who wrote Cui Yan's biography in the Records of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi), Cui's true intention in writing those remarks was to mock Yang Xun's critics {{for being too}} eager to disparage Yang without making any careful consideration. However, Cui Yan was accused of displaying arrogance and defaming Cao Cao in his letter. Cao Cao angrily said, [...] "There is a saying, 'I {{gave birth to a}} daughter, that is all.' 'That is all' is not a complimentary phrase. He meant disrespect when he wrote, 'There will be changes as time passes.'" [...] Cao Cao then had Cui Yan stripped off his post, thrown into prison, and ordered to perform hard labour. Later, he sent agents to observe Cui Yan in prison and they reported that Cui continued to remain defiant. Cao Cao issued an official statement, [...] "Even though Cui Yan is serving a sentence, he still receives high numbers of visitors in prison. He glares at them <b>straight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> as if he has grievances." [...] He then forced Cui Yan to commit suicide.|$|E
2500|$|The Weilüe {{recorded}} {{more details}} of the events leading to Cui Yan's death. It mentioned that Cui Yan's letter to Yang Xun fell {{into the hands of}} Cui Yan's enemies, who accused him of defaming Cao Cao. Cao Cao felt that Cui Yan was discrediting him so he had the latter arrested, imprisoned, head shaved, and sent to perform hard labour. Later, Cui Yan's enemies told Cao Cao, [...] "When Cui Yan serves his sentence, he glares at people <b>straight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> as if he is filled with resentment." [...] Cao Cao believed them and wanted Cui Yan to die so he sent an official to inform Cui, [...] "You've three days to live." [...] Cui Yan did not understand what the official meant and he continued to live on for several days. When the official reported to Cao Cao that Cui Yan was alive and well, Cao furiously said, [...] "Cui Yan is forcing me to use the sword on him!" [...] The official went to see Cui Yan again and explained to the latter that Cao Cao actually wanted him to kill himself within three days. Cui Yan said, [...] "How silly of me. I didn't know that he actually wanted me to do this." [...] He committed suicide after that.|$|E
2500|$|MacGowan {{had decided}} to name the song after J. P. Donleavy's 1973 novel A Fairy Tale of New York, which Finer was reading {{at the time and}} had left lying around the {{recording}} studio. In the same Melody Maker interview MacGowan expressed regret that the song had not been completed in time to be released for Christmas that year, and hinted that the track would appear on an EP that The Pogues were due to record shortly. In January 1986 the group recorded the song during the sessions with Costello that would produce the Poguetry in Motion EP, with bass player Cait O'Riordan singing the female part. Costello suggested naming the song [...] "Christmas Eve in the Drunk Tank", after the song's opening lines: the band were scornful of the suggestion, with MacGowan pointing out to Costello that a song with such a title was unlikely to be favourably received and played by radio stations. The majority of the lyrics had been written while MacGowan was recovering in a bed in Malmö after being struck down with double pneumonia during a Pogues tour of Scandinavia in late 1985 – he later said, [...] "you get a lot of delirium and stuff, so I got quite a few good images out of that". However, despite several attempts at recording it, the group were unhappy with the results and the song was temporarily put aside, to be returned to at a later date. Guitarist Philip Chevron later said, [...] "It was not quite there. It needed to have a full-on, confident performance from the band, which it lacked." [...] The producer of the final version, Steve Lillywhite, diplomatically described the version recorded with O'Riordan's vocals as not [...] "fully realised". Extracts from these earlier versions can be heard on the 2008 box set Just Look Them <b>Straight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> and Say... POGUEMAHONE!!.|$|E
