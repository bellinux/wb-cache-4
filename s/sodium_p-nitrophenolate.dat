The crystal is usually grown from methanol. By suitably varying the growth parameters, we obtained stable, transparent, <b>sodium</b> <b>p-nitrophenolate</b> dihydrate using water as a solvent. Large single crystals of the dimension 20 × 17 × 8 mm^ 3 were grown by a temperature-lowering method. Preliminary characterizations were carried out on the grown sample and compared with methanol-grown NPNa. 2 H_ 2 O.

40|$|Nonlinear optical {{material}} of <b>sodium</b> <b>p-nitrophenolate</b> dihydrate was synthesized by employing {{the technique of}} controlled evaporation {{and the effect of}} temperature on growth morphology was investigated. Single crystal XRD analysis confirms that the crystals with different morphologies have the same lattice parameters. The high-resolution X-ray diffraction curves recorded by a multicrystal X-ray diffractometer revealed the presence of very low angle tilt boundaries. The green emission band at 524 nm is due to the existence of defects on the crystal which corroborated with HRXRD studies.

Thermal analysis and powder X-ray diffraction studies {{were carried out}} on these crystals. Kurtz powder SHG technique was used for qualitative assessment of their nonlinear optical (NLO) activity. From the detailed single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies it is established that NPNa has three different forms, of which only one is found to possess NLO activity.

40|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>p-nitrophenolate</b> {{dihydrate}} (NPNa) {{is a new}} semiorganic nonlinear optical crystal. It has a d(eff) {{of about}} 1. 2 times that of potassium titanyl phosphate. Large single crystals of NPNa were grown from water and methanol solutions by isothermal solvent evaporation. The morphology of the grown crystals was indexed. The defect content of the methanol grown crystals was evaluated by chemical etching and synchrotron topography. The section topography carried out on a large uncut crystal revealed a considerable reduction in the defect density away from the seed. The improved optical transmission of NPNa crystals was achieved by purifying the starting materials.

40|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>p-nitrophenolate</b> {{dihydrate}} single crystals possess excellent nonlinear {{optical properties}} {{such that they}} can be used for optical second-harmonic generation. It belongs to the orthorhombic system with the space group Ima 2. Slow evaporation or slow cooling techniques can be used to grow good optical quality single crystals from supersaturated solution. All the nine elastic constants of this crystal have been measured using an ultrasonic technique. Samples for measurements have been cut along desired crystallographic axes and the pulse echo overlap technique has been used to measure longitudinal and shear ultrasonic wave velocities along appropriate symmetry directions in the crystal. The McSkimin Delta t criterion has been applied to determine the round trip travel time accurately, from which the nine elastic constants have been evaluated.

40|$|The {{need to have}} {{a measure}} of the {{strength}} of some substituted benzoic acids in ionic liquid solution led us to use the protonation equilibrium of <b>sodium</b> <b>p-nitrophenolate</b> as a probe reaction, which was studied by means of spectrophotometric titration at 298 K. In order to evaluate the importance of electronic effect of the substituents present on the aromatic ring, both electron-withdrawing and -donor substituents were taken into account. Furthermore, to have a measure {{of the importance of the}} steric effect of the substituents both para- and ortho-substituted benzoic acids were analyzed. The probe reaction was studied in two ionic liquids differing for the ability of the cation to give hydrogen bond and π-π interactions, namely [bm 2 im][NTf 2] and [bmpyrr][NTf 2]. Data collected show that benzoic acids are less dissociated in ionic liquid than in water solution. Furthermore, the equilibrium constant values seem to be significantly affected by both the nature of ionic liquid cation and the structure of the acid. In particular, the ortho-steric effect seems to operate differently in water and in the aromatic ionic liquid, determining in this solvent medium a particular behavior for orthosubstituted benzoic acids...|$|E
40|$|Physical {{properties}} such as dielectric, specific heat, thermal expansion, {{and mechanical}} hardness have been measured for <b>sodium</b> <b>p-nitrophenolate</b> dihydrate single crystals. The dielectric measurements were made {{both as a}} function of frequency (in the range 15 kHz- 10 MHz) and temperature (in the range 30 - 80 degreesC). For the range of frequencies measured the values were found to vary between 4. 03 and 3. 69 for epsilon (11), 8. 11 and 7. 05 for epsilon (22), and 5. 71 and 5. 36 for epsilon (33) at room temperature, and piezoelectric resonances were observed at certain frequencies. The dielectric measurements made {{as a function of}} temperature did not exhibit any anomaly in the temperature range measured. The specific heat studies carried out for this compound showed approximate to 30 % increase in C-p with the temperature in the measured range. The thermal expansion measured as a function of temperature in the range 30 - 80 degreesC exhibited linear behavior and the average thermal expansion coefficients were found to be alpha (1) = 7. 48 x 10 (- 5) K- 1, alpha (2) = 4. 30 x 10 (- 6) K- 1, and alpha (3) = 1. 99 x 10 (- 5) K- 1.

40|$|Nonlinear optics and ferroelectrics {{have been}} {{recognized}} for several decades as promising fields with important applications {{in the area of}} opto-electronics, photonics, memory devices, etc. High performance electro-optical switching elements for telecommunications and optical information processing are based on the material properties. Hence, there is always a continuous search for new and better materials. In this thesis we have investigated the growth and physical properties of four crystals viz. two NLO and two ferroelectric crystals. This thesis consists of eight chapters. The first chapter gives an overview of historical perspectives of nonlinear optical phenomenon, ferroelectricity and materials developed therein. The second chapter gives {{a brief description of the}} underlying theories of crystal growth, nonlinear optics and ferroelectricity. A major portion of this chapter consists of gist of the earlier work carried out on compounds of our interest viz. urea L-malic acid, <b>sodium</b> <b>p-nitrophenolate</b> dihydrate, glycine phosphite and lithium niobate. Synthesis, growth, crystal structure details and some physical properties of these materials are briefed. The third chapter describes the experimental techniques needed to grow as well as characterize these crystals. The experiments are performed on single crystals grown in the laboratory using the solution growth setup and Czochralski crystal puller. These growth units are described in detail. Preliminary characterization techniques like powder Xray diffraction, optical transmission, scanning electron microscopy, Vickers and Knoop hardness are described briefly. Various experimental methods viz. dielectric, polarization reversal, photoacoustic spectroscopy and laser induced damage for characterizing the grown crystals are explained. Urea L-malic acid (ULMA) is a new NLO organic material which is reported to exhibit second harmonic efficiency three times that of the widely used inorganic crystal, KDP. Hence, this material is selected for detailed investigation and the results obtained are discussed in chapter 4. This chapter contains details of single crystal growth and characterization of ULMA. The crystals are grown by slow cooling technique. The complete morphology of the crystal is evaluated using optical goniometry. The grown crystals are characterized for their optical and thermal properties. The defect content in the grown crystal is evaluated by chemical etching. As the surface damage of the crystal by high power lasers limits its performance in NLO applications, a detailed laser induced damage studies are performed on ULMA. Both single shot and multiple shot damage threshold values for 1064 nm and 532 nm laser radiation are determined and correlated with the mechanical hardness. In addition, the thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity of ULMA along various crystallographic orientations are evaluated using laser induced photoacoustic spectroscopy and the results are interpreted in terms of crystal bonding environment. Another NLO crystal taken up for study is <b>sodium</b> <b>p-nitrophenolate</b> dihydrate (NPNa 2 H 2 O), a semiorganic material. This crystal is a very efficient NLO material and has the advantages of both organics and inorganics. Earlier investigations on growth of NPNa. 2 H 2 O in various solvents have shown methanol as the most suitable solvent for growth. Growth from aqueous solution was discarded as it did not yield crystals which are stable. In the present investigation, stable, NLO active NPNa. 2 H 2 O crystals are obtained using aqueous solution itself by varying the crystallization conditions and exploring the suitable temperature range. The details of growth and characterization form the subject of fifth chapter. The grown crystals are characterized using optical transmission, XRD and thermo gravimetric analysis. Later, laser induced damage threshold is evaluated for both 1064 nm and 532 nm laser radiation and compared wit the methanol grown ones. A possible mechanism of damage is given. The sixth and seventh chapters deal with growth and characterization of ferroelectric materials namely glycine phosphite and lithium niobate respectively. Glycine phosphite is a low temperature ferroelectric crystal which is well studied in terms of its dielectric and ferroelectric properties. But very few radiation damage studies are reported. The effect of ionizing radiation on ferroelectrics is of considerable interest as it significantly modifies the physical properties of these materials. In the present investigation, effects of X-ray irradiation (_ = 1. 5418 °A) on the lattice parameters, dielectric constant, loss tangent, polarization switching characteristics and domain dynamics of glycine phosphite are investigated. X-ray irradiation is performed in the non-polar phase of the sample. The effect as a function of duration of exposure is studied. X-ray irradiation in GPI has resulted in drastic reduction in _ values and shift in transition temperature towards lower temperatures. X-ray irradiation on polarization switching properties of the crystal are also investigated. The activation energy and threshold field of switching increase with the irradiation time. The behaviour of domain wall mobility is quite different from that exhibited by other well known ferroelectrics. These results are discussed in chapter 6 and a possible explanation for the unusual behaviour of domain wall mobility is given. The defect generated is identified as PO 32 − radical by electron paramagnetic measurement. Lithium niobate (LiNbO 3) is an extensively studied material in terms of its NLO and ferroelectric properties. This material has high piezoelectric coupling coefficients along certain directions which makes it suitable for wide band surface acoustic wave applications. Hence there is a demand for good quality, single domain YZ-LiNbO 3 substrates. Chapter 7 describes the growth of Z-pulled congruent LiNbO 3 using Czochralski technique. Large single crystals of diameter 30 mm and length 80 mm are grown from congruent composition employing Czochralski technique. The grown crystals are multidomain and hence electric field poling is performed to get single domain crystals. Their subsequent characterization for SAW devices upto 200 MHz was performed and compared with the imported substrate. The general conclusions are given in chapter 8 along with possible future work that could be performed on these crystals...|$|E
