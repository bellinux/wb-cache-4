The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of elastane linear density and loop length on the stretch, recovery, and compression properties of the weft-knitted polyamide/elastane (PA/EL) stretchable fabrics used in sportswear. Two different tests were performed to study the <b>stretch</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> properties of the fabric 1 st: under low power force and 2 nd: cyclic loading under high tension force. Kikuhime pressure sensor was used to measure the pressure generated by different PA/EL knitted sample garment sleeves. It was found that with the increase in elastane linear density there is an increase in fabric course density, areal density, recovery percentage, and compression, and fabric stretch percentage and elongation percentage decreased in both course and wale direction. The results of fabric samples were analyzed in Minitab statistical software. The coefficients of determinations (R 2 values) of the regression equations showed good prediction ability of the developed statistical models...|$|E
40|$|Conventional pattern {{construction}} and pattern making methods typically require the size measurements {{of a range}} of standard mannequins or human bodies in order to construct the varying pattern blocks for garment design. These various methods and skills, in the fashion industry, factory or studio are performed by pattern makers or producers, and are refined through the garment sampling and wearer trial system (an uneconomical trial and error) used on woven garments or on woven stretch garments to produce varying garment designs. This is particularly true when fabric <b>stretch</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> properties and values are encountered. There is a strong alliance with the heuristic knowledge. The aim of the present work is to investigate the influence of woven stretch fabric properties on pattern construction. The <b>stretch</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> properties of woven stretch fabrics will be taken account for pattern reduction and alteration {{for the development of a}} suitable garment pattern to fit the body shape and to meet the comfort requirement during the body movement. The relationship between the degree of alteration and reduction and the relevant fabric stretch properties is to be established. In this thesis, the <b>stretch</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> properties of various woven stretch fabrics have been measured. The conventional pattern is reduced and altered based on the comfort requirement for body movement, fit to body shape and the extension and recovery properties of the woven stretch fabric. Wearer trial test of the altered garment pattern of woven stretch fabrics is carried out for subjective and objective evaluation in the reference of the traditional woven garment pattern. Their comfort and garment appearances are evaluated by a panel of judges and the wearer. The size and shape stability of garments after the wearing tests are assessed. The results demonstrated that the new pattern method was significantly better for woven stretch fabric. The garment pattern for fit and comfort can be predicated and produced according to the extension and recovery properties of fabrics...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a garment during its usage {{is very important for}} consumers. Performance as such is a very wide term and may range from satisfying the requirements during its use to the durability. Comfort is also considered by many consumers today as one of the performance requirements. For stretchable denim fabric, the fit related comfort lies in the ability of the material to be stretched when a load is applied according to body movements and retain to its original length. While designing the stretch denim, fabric weight and weave plays important role for comfort, performance and fashion. In this study, the effect of fabric parameters such as areal density, Lycra content and weave on characteristics of stretchable denim fabrics were investigated. Various properties such as thickness, tensile strength, flexural rigidity, <b>stretch</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> properties and air permeability of the fabrics were evaluated. The test results revealed that increasing the fabric weight increased fabric warp tensile strength, compressibility, <b>stretch</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery,</b> whereas the flexural rigidity, weft tensile strength and air permeability were decreased. As Lycra contents in fabric increased, fabric thickness was increased which resulted in higher flexural rigidity of fabric. Fabric construction and weave also influenced the fabric flexural rigidity and air permeability related to performance and comfort of stretchable denim fabric...|$|E

40|$|The {{symptoms}} of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) {{can be improved}} by shunt surgery, but prediction of treatment outcome is not established. We investigated changes of the corticospinal tract (CST) in iNPH before and after shunt surgery by using diffusion microstructural imaging, which infers more specific tissue properties than conventional diffusion tensor imaging. Two biophysical models were used: neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) and white matter tract integrity (WMTI). In both methods, the orientational coherence within the CSTs was higher in patients than in controls, and some normalization occurred after the surgery in patients, indicating axon <b>stretching</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery.</b> The estimated axon density was lower in patients than in controls but remained unchanged after the surgery, suggesting its potential as a marker for irreversible neuronal damage. In a Monte-Carlo simulation that represented model axons as undulating cylinders, both NODDI and WMTI separated the effects of axon density and undulation. Thus, diffusion MRI may distinguish between reversible and irreversible microstructural changes in iNPH. Our findings constitute a step towards a quantitative image biomarker that reflects pathological process and treatment outcomes of iNPH...|$|R
40|$|Micro- and {{nanoscale}} surface textures, when optimally designed, {{present a}} unique approach to improve surface functionalities. Coupling surface texture with shape memory polymers may generate reversibly tuneable surface properties. A shape memory polyetherurethane {{is used to}} prepare various surface textures including 2 [*]μm- and 200 [*]nm-gratings, 250 [*]nm-pillars and 200 [*]nm-holes. The mechanical deformation via <b>stretching</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> of the surface texture are investigated {{as a function of}} length scales and shapes. Results show the 200 [*]nm-grating exhibiting more deformation than 2 [*]μm-grating. Grating imparts anisotropic and surface area-to-volume effects, causing different degree of deformation between gratings and pillars under the same applied macroscopic strain. Full distribution of stress within the film causes the holes to deform more substantially than the pillars. In the recovery study, unlike a nearly complete recovery for the gratings after 10 transformation cycles, the high contribution of surface energy impedes the <b>recovery</b> of holes <b>and</b> pillars. The surface textures are shown to perform a switchable wetting function.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The garment <b>stretch</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> {{characteristics}} due to body movements can be indirectly {{assessed by}} the dynamic elastic recovery (DER) value of the fabrics at different extension levels. In order to study DER of elastic fabrics, a comparative analysis was made between spandex-plated cotton fabric and spandex core cotton spun (SCCS) fabric. It {{was found that the}} spandex-plated cotton fabric has higher DER value than that of SCCS fabric. The results of this study show that this phenomenon is due to the residual energy of the elastane unraveled from these fabrics. The stress values of these fabrics have no significant effect at 95 % confidence level. It is concluded that the spandex-plated cotton fabric is suitable than SCCS fabric, for the tight fit garments meant for the sports like Javelin, shot-put, and athletics.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to study the load-elongation and creep behavior of water set single hair fiber coils at constant RH to provide some insights into their physical behavior. Single fibers were used instead of tresses to avoid complications from interfiber interactions and to simplify data interpretation. The first portion {{of this paper is}} concerned with measuring forces involved in <b>stretching</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> of single hair fibers water set as helical spirals. For initial uncoiling, the load is approximately proportional to the extension. With further extension a region is found in which load is proportional to the logarithm of the extension. However, as the fiber approaches traightness, once against he load is proportional to the extension. A large proportion of the extension is recoverable even after multiple extension-recovery cycles; however, some coil loss occurs, confirming a lack of true elasticity. The existence of creep confirms the absence of a true Hookean region for stretching water set single fiber coils. With no external load, most of the fiber creep (84 %) or uncoiling can be explained by fiber diameter, with thicker fibers resisting coil deformation better than thinner ones. With small added loads no meaningful relationship between creep and fiber diameter was found. However, the initial coil deflection with added load is significantly related to fiber diameter. Spiral spring theory predicts apower dependence of coil deflection on fiber diameter, and is useful for predicting the initial deflection but not the creep of water set hair curls with load...|$|R

30|$|The second {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to familiarize students with the features and benefits of using cotton for active apparel through a semester-long product development assignment. The students’ fabric choices were limited to cotton and cotton blends because of the Cotton Incorporated sponsorship; however, as many researchers previously established (Chae and Evenson 2013; Cotton Incorporated’s Life Style Monitor 2012; Davis 1987; Forsthe and Thomas 1989; Robinson 2009), baby boomers prefer natural fibers such as cotton. Therefore, this project still represented a useful and innovative learning approach for the fashion students. Through this pedagogical consideration, the students gained knowledge of the features and benefits of cotton for tennis wear. By selecting appropriate fabrics (i.e., cotton or cotton blend jersey knits) that met the needs of female baby boomers, the students became more confident with the qualities of cotton (e.g., soft, breathable, comfortable, and easy to care for) to make the wearer look good and feel even better. These positive properties of cotton matched what the target customers wanted.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{performance}} of hosiery made from a new fiber, polypropylene, with the performance of hosiery made from a better known fiber, nylon, and to get some indication of consumer reaction to a new textile product. Information was obtained through two wear tests and selected laboratory tests using different brands of hosiery with both fiber types represented. Two questionnaires were used as part of the wear tests. The first obtained information about the subjects and about some of their opinions concerning hosiery wear in general. The second questionnaire obtained information about the subjects' opinions concerning the hosiery worn in the wear tests. Thirty subjects participated in the first wear test with each wearing one pair of hosiery made of each fiber. Ten subjects participated in the second wear test, six of whom had also been part of the first test. The performance of the hosiery was checked by considering the number, severity and position of faults which occurred in relation to the number of days worn and by measuring to find the amount of stretch found in the worn hosiery. Laboratory tests were conducted to verify certain information obtained about the hosiery during the wear tests as well as to obtain further information about the hosiery. The questionnaires were analyzed by using percentages of the number responding to each part of each question. In this way, a general picture of the majority could be made to find out something about the subjects as a group and about their opinions of the hosiery. The wear life of the hosiery as shown by the number of days worn was related to the number of total faults found in the test hosiery. In addition, each type of fault, snags, runs, and abrasion marks, was considered. The two fiber types of hosiery were compared by testing to find if the differences between means were significant using F ratios. An additional check was made for covariance between the number of runs and the total days worn, and between the number of abrasion marks and the total days worn. All hosiery increased in width and decreased in length during the wear periods. The average amounts of dimensional change were analyzed by comparing the mean differences of the two fiber types of hosiery. The results were verified in the laboratory using a <b>stretch</b> <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> test under controlled conditions. The differences in the means found in the laboratory test were checked for significance using F ratios. The rates of recovery were plotted on a time graph. An evaluation of the degree of fading was made by a panel of judges using a ranking system. The amount of, and the deviation from linear regression was found. Hosiery of both fiber types were washed in the laboratory and used as control groups to check with hosiery worn and washed by the subjects. Four laboratory tests were conducted to help describe the hosiery used in the study and to supply further information as to the differences in performance of hosiery made of polypropylene and of nylon. The yarn numbers and the course and wale counts were found. Yarn breaking strengths and the percents of elongation were analyzed by using a t test. Standard deviations checked the amounts of variation from the means.

Eight PKP- 2 mutations were identified of which four were novel: frame-shifts disrupting Armadillo domains (ARM) 4, 5 and 8, and a non-sense disrupting ARM 2. One missense and two frame-shift novel DP mutations occurred. Pedigree analysis showed incomplete gene penetrance and variable ARVC expression. Stable cells over-expressing A 733 fsX 740 PKP- 2 showed increased cellular adhesion and apoptosis following mechanical <b>stretch</b> <b>recovery,</b> <b>and</b> absence of cell junction Connexin- 43 (Cx 43) protein without {{significant change in}} cell-input resistance. Desmosomal lengths were statistically unaltered, but intermittent pale DS coupling occurred. Truncated PKP- 2 showed reduced PG interaction. Stable cells over-expressing S 140 FPKP- 2 showed no differences in cell proliferation, adhesion, apoptosis following mechanical <b>stretch</b> <b>recovery,</b> <b>and</b> in cell junction Cx 43 protein localization. DS lengths, however, were significantly increased, and missense PKP- 2 showed reduced p-catenin interaction.

Altered DS morphologies featured prominently in all three mutant protein expressions. Reduced inter-protein interactions of truncated and missense PKP- 2 proteins with PG and p-catenin respectively suggests PG and p-catenin signalling may be affected.

The {{results suggest that the}} aligned MWNTs could help storing and releasing the internal elastic energy during <b>stretching</b> <b>and</b> relaxation. Besides, {{it was found that the}} self-aligned MWNTs shape memory fibers recovered the original length more quickly. This provides the possibility of fabricating smart instruments with higher sensitivity. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R

40|$|Purpose] We {{examined}} the effects of prolonged <b>stretching</b> <b>and</b> thermotherapy on muscle contracture of immobilized rat soleus muscles by determining ankle joint range of motion (ROM), collagen fibril arrangement in the endomysium and insoluble collagen content. [Methods] In the experimental group, bilateral ankle joints of each rat were fixed in full plantar flexion with plaster casts for four weeks. Then, the experimental group animals were randomly partitioned into five groups: 1) immobilization alone; <b>and</b> 2) spontaneous <b>recovery,</b> 3) prolonged <b>stretching,</b> 4) thermotherapy, <b>and</b> 5) prolonged <b>stretching</b> immediately following thermotherapy for 2 weeks after cast removal. Prolonged stretching of the soleus muscle (30 min/day) was conducted by maintaining the dorsiflexion position of the ankle joint. Thermotherapy consisted of immersion of bilateral hindlimbs (20 min/day) in hot water (42 °C). Under anesthesia, both treatments were performed six days per week during the two-week remobilization. [Results] Immobilization led to decreased ROM, collagen fibril movement in the endomysium and increased insoluble collagen. Prolonged <b>stretching</b> <b>and</b> the combination of <b>stretching</b> <b>and</b> thermotherapy accelerated amelioration of the ROM limitation and diminished collagen fibril movement. [Conclusion] Our findings suggest that while thermotherapy does not exert a specific effect on muscle contracture, prolonged stretching can promote recovery...|$|R
