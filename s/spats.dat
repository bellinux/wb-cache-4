5|$|Renowned as Batman's {{greatest}} enemy, the Joker {{is known}} {{by a number}} of nicknames, including the Clown Prince of Crime, the Jester of Genocide, the Harlequin of Hate, and the Ace of Knaves. During the evolution of the DC Universe, interpretations and versions of the Joker have taken two forms. The original, dominant image is that of an extreme psychopath, with genius-level intelligence and a warped, sadistic sense of humor. The other version, popular in comic books from the late 1940s to the 1960s and in the 1960s television series, is an eccentric, harmless prankster and thief. Like other long-lived characters, the Joker's character and cultural interpretations have changed with time, however unlike other characters who may need to reconcile or ignore previous versions to make sense, more than any other comic book character, the Joker thrives on his mutable and irreconcilable identities. The Joker is typically seen in a purple suit with a long-tailed, padded-shoulder jacket, a string tie, gloves, striped pants and <b>spats</b> on pointed-toe shoes (sometimes with a wide-brimmed hat). This appearance is such a fundamental aspect of the character that when the 2004 animated series The Batman placed the Joker in a straitjacket, it quickly redesigned him in his familiar suit.|$|E
5|$|The first presenters of Blue Peter were Christopher Trace and Leila Williams. Trace {{presented}} for nearly nine years, and Williams for just {{over three years}} (although no footage of her has been retained by the BBC). In the early days, as the show ran continuously on a weekly basis, other presenters occasionally stepped in to give the regular team a break. Artist Tony Hart and actress Ann Taylor both presented the show either in place of either Trace or Williams, or sometimes in place of both, with Taylor replacing Williams for six weeks in 1959 and presenting the show at least once alone, as did Hart. When Williams was fired from the show in 1962 following a series of <b>spats</b> with a newly appointed producer, Trace continued to present the show alone or with one-off presenters until a replacement was found. The role went to Anita West, who presented sixteen editions over a four-month period in 1962—the shortest tenure of any full-time presenter—before abruptly resigning due to her imminent divorce, a reason she hid from the producers. Her tenure was so short that no footage from her time on Blue Peter exists in the BBC Archives, although footage of her audition remains, along with that of Valerie Singleton and other auditionees. It was not until 1998 that West was officially recognised as a former presenter. John Noakes is the longest-serving presenter, having presented the show for over twelve years, and Konnie Huq is the longest-serving female presenter, with a tenure of over ten years, beating Valerie Singleton by three months. However, although Singleton left the series full-time in 1972 to present the spin-off series Blue Peter Special Assignment, she continued to be an occasional presenter until 1975. Singleton's last 'official' appearance on the show came on 20 October 1975 although she was also credited with appearing on the 1975 'review of the year' programme, broadcast on 29 December 1975 Sandra Michaels presented the show twice in April 1964 {{in the absence of}} Singleton and impressed producer Edward Barnes enough that he considered replacing Singleton, but Michaels turned him down and he opted to carry on with Singleton, something he admits in hindsight he was glad he did. The youngest presenter of Blue Peter was Yvette Fielding, who was eighteen when she began presenting, and the oldest was John Noakes, who was forty-four when he left. Only one presenter, Peter Duncan, had two stints of presenting, his first being from 1980 to 1984, and his second being from 1985 to 1986.|$|E

50|$|Collection of wild <b>spat</b> has {{historically}} been the most common way obtaining young scallops to seed aquaculture operations. There {{are a variety of}} ways in which <b>spat</b> can be collected. Most methods involve a series of mesh <b>spat</b> bags suspended in the water column on a line which is anchored to the seafloor. <b>Spat</b> bags are filled with a suitable cultch (usually filamentous fibers) onto which scallop larvae will settle. Here larvae will undergo metamorphosis into post-larvae (<b>spat).</b> <b>Spat</b> can then be collected and transferred to a farm site for on-growing.|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluated}} experimental {{collection of}} Pinctada mazatlanica <b>spat</b> on substrates of different textures and colors placed at different depths within settlement tanks. When larvae reached the pediveliger stage (day 25), black-colored <b>spat</b> collectors ("envelope" type) {{composed of the}} following materials were offered as settlement substrates: onion bag, mosquito net, fishing net, and 63 % shade-cloth. <b>Spat</b> collectors measured 30 x 30 cm and were composed of an outer bag and inner substrate made of the same material. The influence {{of the color of}} <b>spat</b> collector material on recruitment was investigated using a second type of <b>spat</b> collector composed of onion bags as the outer bag and inner substrate ("bag" type). Bags were prepared in 3 different outer/inner (O/I) color combinations of green/green, green/black, and red/black (O/I). Both types of collectors were deployed at different depths within settlement tanks. Approximately 2. 7 % of the initial larval population survived, resulting in 35, 583 <b>spat.</b> Of these, 71. 3 % recruited to bag type collectors, 21. 9 % to envelope type collectors, and 6. 8 % to the surfaces of the culture tanks. <b>Spat</b> recruitment was significantly affected by collector material (P < 0. 01), with fishing net and shade-cloth yielding highest and lowest density of <b>spat,</b> respectively. Similarly, <b>spat</b> collector color combination significantly influenced <b>spat</b> collection (P < 0. 01), with higher recruitment to red and green substrates. For both <b>spat</b> collector types, there was significantly greater (P < 0. 01) recruitment of <b>spat</b> to collectors {{in the middle of the}} water column (60 - 90 -cm depth).
