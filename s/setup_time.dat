5|$|According to setup {{coordinator}} Douglas Cook, the rehearsals {{enabled them}} to reduce the <b>setup</b> <b>time</b> to under five minutes. Cook, who had worked on previous halftime shows, understood the details and guided the team. Drawings of the performances depicted what was expected for each setup, with the volunteers assembling the stage in segments and moving them to the field with carts. Madonna's entrance had to be rehearsed several times for coordination. Although Cook learned during the game that the New England Patriots were scheduled to exit on the route used by volunteers carrying the stage equipment, he resolved the issue by talking with the team.|$|E
5|$|For {{manual welding}} methods, labor costs {{generally}} {{make up the}} vast majority of the total cost. As a result, many cost-saving measures are focused on minimizing operation time. To do this, welding procedures with high deposition rates can be selected, and weld parameters can be fine-tuned to increase welding speed. Mechanization and automation are often implemented to reduce labor costs, but this frequently increases the cost of equipment and creates additional <b>setup</b> <b>time.</b> Material costs tend to increase when special properties are necessary, and energy costs normally do not amount to more than several percent of the total welding cost.|$|E

40|$|Flowshop {{scheduling}} {{problems with}} <b>setup</b> <b>times</b> arise naturally in many practical situations. This paper provides {{a review of}} static and deterministic flowshop scheduling research involving machine <b>setup</b> <b>times.</b> The literature is classified into four broad categories, namely sequence independent job <b>setup</b> <b>times,</b> sequence dependent job setup rimes, sequence independent family <b>setup</b> <b>times,</b> and sequence dependent family <b>setup</b> <b>times.</b> Using the suggested classification scheme, this paper organizes the flowshop scheduling literature involving <b>setup</b> and/or removal <b>times</b> and summarizes the existing research for different flowshop problem types.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} new scheduling heuristics, namely Mean Progressive Weighted Tardiness Estimator (MPWT) Heuristic Method {{and modified}} priority rules with sequence-dependent <b>setup</b> <b>times</b> consideration. These {{are designed to}} solve job shop scheduling problems with new performance measures – progressive weighted tardiness penalties. More realistic constraints, which are inter-machine overlapping sequencedependent <b>setup</b> <b>times,</b> are considered. In real production environments, inter-machine overlapping sequencedependent setups are significant. Therefore, modified scheduling generation algorithms of active and nondelay schedules for job shop problems with inter-machine overlapping sequence-dependent <b>setup</b> <b>times</b> are proposed in this paper. In addition, new customer-based measures of performance, which are total earliness and progressive weighted tardiness, and total progressive weighted tardiness, are proposed. The objective of the first experiment is to compare the proposed priority rules with the consideration of sequence-dependent <b>setup</b> <b>times</b> and the standard priority rules without <b>setup</b> <b>times</b> consideration. The {{results indicate that the}} proposed priority rules with <b>setup</b> <b>times</b> consideration are superior to the standard priority rules without the consideration of <b>setup</b> <b>times.</b> From the second experiment and the third experiment to compare the proposed MPWT heuristic approach with the efficient priority rules with <b>setup</b> <b>times</b> consideration, the MPWT heuristic method is significantly superior to the Batched Apparent Tardiness Cost with Sequence-dependent Setups (BATCS) rule, and othe...|$|R

40|$|In many {{real-world}} job-shop situations, {{jobs are}} sequence dependent and the <b>setup</b> <b>times</b> for those jobs vary stochastically {{because of such}} random factors as crew skills, temporary shortage of equipment, tools and setup crews, and unexpected breakdowns of fixtures and tools during a setup operation. Assuming these random <b>setup</b> <b>times</b> to be fixed at, say, their expected values, which is often done in the extant literature, may lead to development of inefficient sequencing rules. The {{purpose of the present}} paper is to investigate the impact of setup-time variation on sequencing decisions, with normally-distributed <b>setup</b> <b>times.</b> Results show that setup-time variation has a negative impact on shop performance, but does not diminish the advantages of setup-conscious sequencing rules over conventional sequencing rules in dealing with <b>setup</b> <b>times.</b> A simulation model of a nine-machine job-shop is used in the investigation. job-shop scheduling <b>setup</b> <b>times</b> sequencing simulation...|$|R

500|$|Series creator Rob Thomas was {{initially}} worried about including the reunion between Apollo and Kizza {{because he thought}} that such scenes did not play to his strengths as a storyteller.

In the episode, Apollo is scheduled to appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show; Oprah's Book Club was discussing a book about a child soldier at the time, but this was a coincidence. In the episode, Piz states that he has been given an internship with Pitchfork Media at their headquarters in New York City; however, the location is incorrect.|$|E

40|$|Much of the {{research}} on operations scheduling problems has either ignored <b>setup</b> <b>times</b> or assumed that <b>setup</b> <b>times</b> on each machine are independent of the job sequence. This paper considers the problem of scheduling a single machine for minimizing total tardiness in a sequence dependent setup environment. The comparative performance of branch-and-bound, genetic search, simulated annealing and random-start pairwise interchange was evaluated in this problem setting. The experimental results suggest that simulated annealing and random-start pairwise interchange are viable solution techniques that can yield good solutions to a large combinatorial problem when considering the tardiness objective with sequence dependent <b>setup</b> <b>times.</b> However, branch-and-bound may be the preferred solution technique in solving smaller problems, and it is the only solution technique tested that will confirm an optimum solution has been reached.
