5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1929, Krichell {{discovered}} Hank Greenberg while on a <b>scouting</b> <b>trip</b> in Massachusetts. Krichell believed Greenberg {{would be the next}} Lou Gehrig. Krichell offered Greenberg a $10,000 contract ($ in 2010) on the spot based on his potential and knowing the Yankees were looking for Jewish players to increase their Jewish fanbase. Greenberg discussed the deal with his father but declined it because he knew his opportunities would be limited by the presence of Gehrig as first baseman. Subsequently, he signed with the Detroit Tigers.|$|E
5|$|Chapman celebrated New Year in London before {{travelling}} {{north on}} a <b>scouting</b> <b>trip</b> to see Bury play Notts County on 1 January 1934. The following day, he travelled {{to his native}} Yorkshire to watch Sheffield Wednesday, Arsenal's next opponents, before spending a final night in his home town of Kiveton Park. He returned to London nursing a cold but was well enough to watch an Arsenal third team match against Guildford City. Soon afterwards, his illness suddenly worsened; pneumonia set in, and Chapman quickly succumbed. He died {{in the early hours}} of 6 January 1934 at his home in Hendon. He was buried four days later in St Mary's Churchyard, Hendon.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{were among}} the favourites to win the {{competition}} while Ajax were virtually unknown outside of the Netherlands. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly had made a <b>scouting</b> <b>trip</b> to watch Ajax before the match and witnessing them lose to lowly opposition returned confident Liverpool would progress. A few of Liverpool's players, including striker Roger Hunt, were part of England's victorious World Cup campaign in 1966. Ajax {{were coming out of}} a poor period, after they had finished in 13th place in the 1964–65 Eredivisie, while the Netherlands national team had yet to make an impression on the international stage. The board of Ajax decided to hire Rinus Michels. He changed the team's formation to a 4–2–4, with an emphasis on passing and possession of the ball. The team showed improvement, winning the Eredivisie in his first season in charge.|$|E

25|$|In May 1859, Colonel Wright made a <b>scouting</b> <b>trip</b> {{fifty miles}} up the Snake River, which joins the Columbia not far {{to the north of}} Wallula. Colonel Wright was the first {{steamboat}} to reach Lewiston, Idaho, 140 miles upriver from Wallula. In 1861 she ascended the Clearwater River to within two miles of the forks, accomplishing the downstream run of over 300 miles to Wallula in less than 24 hours. Thompson and Coe made so much money with the Wright that in the spring of 1860 they built a larger and more powerful steamer, the Tenino on the same route, afterward pooling both steamers with the Oregon Steam Navigation Company.|$|E
25|$|In fact, it was Black {{who was the}} {{original}} target of the Pittsburgh Pirates' June 1, 1954 <b>scouting</b> <b>trip</b> to Richmond. Conducted by pitching coach Clyde Sukeforth, the mission's focus quickly shifted when he witnessed Clemente's throwing and batting prowess in pre-game drills. Nonetheless, Clemente barely played during Sukeforth's three-day visit. With his suspicions further aroused by manager Max Macon's dismissive remarks ("You mean you want him?!") {{and the fact that}} Clemente took batting practice with the pitchers rather than his fellow position players, Sukeforth made inquiries and soon ascertained Clemente's status as an unprotected bonus baby. Before leaving Richmond, he informed Macon that such subterfuge was pointless since the Pirates, well {{on their way to a}} fourth consecutive last-place finish, would thereby secure first pick in the winter draft.|$|E
500|$|Having {{established}} his new club, Houlding applied for {{membership of the}} First Division of the Football League, rather than the newly formed Second Division. The League, unimpressed with this premature application, refused to admit the club, which instead joined the Lancashire League. Liverpool played their first match on 1 September 1892, a pre-season friendly match against Rotherham Town, which they won 7–1. The team Liverpool fielded against Rotherham was composed entirely of Scottish players – manager John McKenna had recruited the players after a <b>scouting</b> <b>trip</b> to Scotland – so they {{became known as the}} [...] "team of Macs". Liverpool's first match in the Lancashire League, which they won 8–0, was against Higher Walton. 200 spectators attended the match, but as the twenty-two match season proceeded, and Liverpool continued to win, attendances increased. Approximately 2,000 people watched Liverpool defeat South Shore in the penultimate match of the season at Anfield.|$|E
50|$|GSA spent $823,000 in {{taxpayer}} money toward the October 2010 convention. $100,405.37 {{was spent in}} employee travel costs {{for a total of}} eight pre-planning meetings, <b>scouting</b> <b>trips,</b> and a “dry run". The report also found excessive spending for event planners, gifts for participants, and lavish meals.|$|R

500|$|In 2011, Eastwood {{directed}} J. Edgar, a biopic of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, with Leonardo DiCaprio in {{the title}} role. The film received mixed reviews, although DiCaprio's performance as Hoover was widely praised. The Rotten Tomatoes consensus was, [...] "Leonardo DiCaprio gives a predictably powerhouse performance, but J. Edgar stumbles in all other departments". Roger Ebert wrote that the film is [...] "fascinating," [...] "masterful," [...] and praised DiCaprio's performance. David Edelstein of New York Magazine, while also praising DiCaprio, wrote, [...] "It's too bad J. Edgar is so shapeless and turgid and ham-handed, so rich in bad lines and worse readings". In January 2011, {{it was announced that}} Eastwood was in talks to direct Beyoncé Knowles in a third remake of the 1937 film A Star Is Born; however, the project was delayed due to Beyoncé's pregnancy. Eastwood then starred in the baseball drama Trouble with the Curve (2012), as a veteran baseball scout who travels with his daughter for a final <b>scouting</b> <b>trip.</b> Robert Lorenz, who worked with Eastwood as an assistant director on several films, directed the film.|$|E
500|$|... "Vienen" [...] {{was shot}} in three locations: a studio in Los Angeles, a closed down CENCO oil {{refinery}} in Santa Fe Springs, and an offshore oil platform in the Pacific Ocean {{off the coast of}} Santa Barbara. During the show's previous seasons, location manager Ilt Jones had been required to scout for locations after scripts were submitted. Starting with the eighth season, however, he was allowed to go on several [...] "scouting roadshow" [...] in order to find new and interesting locations that could be written into scripts. Jones, who discovered the oil platform and the refinery during his first <b>scouting</b> <b>trip,</b> later said the oil platform was [...] "his favorite example" [...] of places he was able to find. Because the platform and refinery were scouted in advance, Jones was given six weeks to prepare the shoota [...] "far cry" [...] from the usual two. This added time also saved the series a considerable amount of money. Filming on the oil platform occurred between sunrise and sunset in one day. The film crew used Steadicams for filming on the oil platform because the decks were slick with oil and, according to Hardy, the cameras [...] "sort of fit and blend in quite well" [...] on the platform.|$|E
2500|$|On August 31, 1908, {{the steamer}} Leona {{was placed on}} a tri-weekly run from Portland to McMinnville. [...] This {{was the first time}} in about five years that a {{steamboat}} had operated above the lock. [...] Reportedly a good cargo was carried on the initial trip. [...] A few days before, Leona had been brought up to McMinnville under Captain Turper. [...] This <b>scouting</b> <b>trip</b> had been difficult because of the snags and floating logs in the river. [...] The government snag boat was expected to soon clear these obstructions.|$|E

2500|$|In Uteritz's {{junior year}} of 1922, the Wolverines were 601 and outscored opponents by a {{combined}} tally of 183 to 13. [...] Uteritz started six of Michigan's seven games in 1922. [...] He missed the opening game against Case as Michigan Coach Fielding H. Yost asked team captain Paul G. Goebel and Uteritz to accompany him to Columbus, Ohio to watch the Ohio State Buckeyes in action against Ohio Wesleyan. [...] The <b>scouting</b> <b>trip</b> appears to have paid off as Uteritz led the Wolverines to 190 win over an Ohio State team that had been favored to win the Big Ten championship.|$|E
2500|$|After {{shutting}} out Illinois (240) and Michigan Agricultural (630), the Wolverines had a bye {{week before}} playing Wisconsin. [...] Yost used the bye week for another <b>scouting</b> <b>trip,</b> traveling with Uteritz, Harry Kipke and Paul G. Goebel to Madison, Wisconsin {{to watch the}} Badgers play. [...] A stenographer was hired {{to sit next to}} Yost in the press box to take down his notes of the game. [...] The following week, Michigan defeated Wisconsin 136, and Uteritz completed a pass to Harry Kipke in the fourth quarter that proved to be the difference in the game. [...] After catching Uteritz's pass, Kipke ran 35 yards for the winning touchdown.|$|E

[...] On the afternoon of March 2, Santa Anna himself conducted a <b>scouting</b> <b>trip.</b> [...] He discovered a road near the Alamo and moved the Jiménez Battalion to guard it.|$|E

During this second {{production}} period, Zhang Yuan again was set to serve as cinematographer and conducted several location <b>scouting</b> <b>trips</b> to Dunhuang. However, August First canceled the production shortly after the Tiananmen Square incident, in part because Dai Qing had supported the demonstrations and was now a problematic figure politically.|$|R
50|$|Gollancz {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the Left Book Club, the first book club in the UK. He had a knack for marketing, {{sometimes}} taking out full-page newspaper advertisements for the books he published, a novelty at the time. He also used eye-catching typography and book designs, and used yellow dust-covers on books. Starting in 1948, Gollancz made yearly <b>scouting</b> <b>trips</b> to the USA; by 1951 American books made up half of his publications.|$|R

2500|$|Lane {{joined the}} Confederate Army and was {{commissioned}} {{as a major}} in the 1st North Carolina Volunteers on May 11, 1861.

Further promotion came quickly {{and he was a}} colonel and commander of the 28th North Carolina Infantry Regiment by September 15. In the Seven Days Battles of 1862 he was twice wounded leading his regiment. He served in Major General A.P. Hill's division of Thomas J. [...] "Stonewall" [...] Jackson's Second Corps for Second Bull Run and took over brigade command following the death of Brigadier General Lawrence O. Branch at the Battle of Antietam.

6000|$|... "Rogers, I'd like to {{have been}} with you. Next time I'll volunteer. You had action--a run for your money. That's what I enlisted for. Standing still--doing nothing but wait--that drives me half mad. My years of {{football}} have made action necessary. Otherwise I go stale in mind and body.... Last night, before you went on that <b>scouting</b> <b>trip,</b> I had been on duty two hours. Near midnight. The shelling had died down. All became quiet. No flares--no flashes anywhere. There was a luminous kind of glow in the sky--moonlight through thin clouds. I had to listen and watch. But I couldn't keep back my thoughts. There I was, a soldier, facing No Man's Land, across whose dark space were the Huns {{we have come to}} regard as devils in brutality, yet less than men.... And I thought of home. No man knows what home really is until he stands that lonely midnight guard. A shipwrecked sailor appreciates the comforts he once had; a desert wanderer, lost and starving, remembers the food he once wasted; a volunteer soldier, facing death in the darkness, thinks of his home! It is a hell of a feeling!... And, thinking of home, I remembered my girl. I've been gone four months--have been at the front seven days (or is it seven years?) and last night in the darkness she came to me. Oh yes! she was there! She seemed reproachful, as she was when she coaxed me not to enlist. My girl was not one of the kind who sends her lover to war and swears she will die an old maid unless he returns. Mine begged me to stay home, or at least wait for the draft. But I wasn't built that way. I enlisted. And last night I felt the bitterness of a soldier's fate. All this beautiful stuff is bunk!... My girl is a peach. She had many admirers, two in particular that made me run my best down the stretch. One is club-footed. He couldn't fight. The other is all yellow. Him she liked best. He had her fooled, the damned slacker.... I wish I could believe I'd get safe back home, with a few Huns to my credit--the Croix de Guerre--and an officer's uniform. That would be great. How I could show up those fellows!... But I'll get killed--as sure as God made little apples I'll get killed--and she will marry {{one of the men who}} would not fight!" ...|$|E
500|$|Extensive {{pre-production}} was necessary. The unique {{nature of}} the film shoot dictated steps not normally taken in filmmaking, such as charting {{the position of the}} sun weeks in advance since they could not use lighting equipment.
