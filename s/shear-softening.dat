40|$|The hydrodynamics of smectic films at an {{air-water}} interface is discussed, {{with particular}} {{focus on the}} viscous response of the film under flow normal to the layers. The corrections to the response functions of the smectic phase, arising from the coupling between the flow and the smectic order parameter, are calculated. The results for the effective viscosity are illustrated by analysing smectic film flow in a channel geometry. Two limiting cases of the flow, namely, motion dominated by dislocation-induced <b>shear-softening</b> and dislocation-free motion dominated by the permeation mode of mass transfer, are studied. The effect of drag from a finite depth liquid subphase is considered. The results are compared to those for hexatic and liquid films. Comment: RevTex, 11 pages + 4 eps figure...|$|E
40|$|Continental glaciers covered {{as much as}} {{thirty percent}} of the present-day {{inhabited}} earth during the Quaternary period. Traditionally, one-dimensional consolidation has been considered as the main process of formation for the soils deposited during glaciation. One of the outcomes of accepting one-dimensional consolidation as the main process of formation is that the geomechanical properties of soil in a horizontal plane are isotropic (known as cross-anisotropy). Recent measurements of subglacial pore pressure and preconsolidation pressure profile have indicated that {{this might not be}} the case. The role of subglacial shear action has probably been long neglected. The main objective of this research is to investigate the effects of subglacial shearing on the geomechanical properties of glaciated soils. Recent research has found evidence of horizontal property anisotropy associated with the direction of the ice-sheet movement. A testing program was thus proposed to explore the relationship between the anisotropy of property and the direction of past glacier movement. The program involves several fundamental engineering parameters of soils. These parameters together with the corresponding test methods are as follows: (i) Conventional oedometer test – yield stress anisotropy; (ii) Oedometer test with lateral stress measurement – stiffness anisotropy; (iii) Load cell pressuremeter (LCPM) test – in situ stress anisotropy. The physical meaning of yield stress determined by conventional oedometer tests was interpreted as the critical state of structural collapse. The literature review and an experimental study on kaolin samples with a known stress history suggested that yield stress possesses certain dependency on the sampling direction. The anisotropy of yield stress for Battleford till from Birsay, Saskatchewan was also explored by testing directional oedometer samples. In addition, the anisotropy of stiffness was also investigated using a newly developed lateral stress oedometer that is capable of independent measurement of horizontal stresses at three different points with angles of 120 degrees. Preliminary evidence of a correlation between the direction of maximum stiffness in a horizontal plane and the known direction of glacial shear was observed. The correlation between the direction of maximum yield stress and known direction of glaciation was rather poor. Anisotropy of in situ stresses was investigated by conducting LCPM tests in Pot clay in the Netherlands. Based on the LCPM test results, it was concluded that the evidence of a correlation between the anisotropy of in situ stress and known direction of glacial advance is still rather obscure. Although both the laboratory studies and field studies cannot sufficiently confirm the existence of lateral anisotropy of geomechanical properties and its relationship to the direction of the Quaternary ice-sheet movement, the effects of subglacial shearing should not be neglected in assessing the geotechnical properties of glaciated soils. In practice, it is usually found that the preconsolidation pressure profile does not follow the gravitational line as predicted by the one-dimensional consolidation theory and its magnitude is not compatible with the measured effective pressure values {{at the base of the}} glacier. It has been suggested that changes in seepage gradient (upward or downward) are responsible for the deviation of preconsolidation pressure profile away from the gravitational line. In this thesis, a new glacial process model – consolidation coupled shearing – was proposed. This model is based on the framework of traditional soil mechanics (critical state theory, Modified Cam-clay model and one-dimensional consolidation theory) and is consistent with the general geological and glaciological evidences. This model may provide an alternative explanation for the preconsolidation pressure patterns generally observed in practice. It can also be combined with groundwater flow characteristics to explain the diversity of the preconsolidation consolidation patterns. The proposed model was used successfully to obtain the preconsolidation pressure profile observed in Battleford till at Birsay and the subglacial <b>shear-softening</b> phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} experimentally {{the mechanical}} response of a monolayer of bi-disperse frictional grains to an inhomogeneous shear perturbation across the jamming transition. We inflate an intruder inside the packing and use photo-elasticity and tracking techniques {{to measure the}} induced shear strain and stresses at the grain scale. We quantify experimentally the constitutive relations for strain amplitudes as low as 0. 001 and {{for a range of}} packing fractions within 2 % variation around the jamming transition. At the transition strong nonlinear effects set in : both the shear modulus and the dilatancy <b>shear-soften</b> at small strain until a critical strain is reached where effective linearity is recovered. The dependencies of the critical strain and the associated critical stresses on the distance from jamming are extracted via scaling analysis. We check that the constitutive laws, when applied to the equations governing mechanical equilibrium, lead to the observed stress and strain profiles. These profiles exhibit a spatial crossover between an effective linear regime close to the inflater and the truly nonlinear regime away from it. The crossover length diverges at the jamming transition. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
