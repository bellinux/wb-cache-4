50|$|Lac is {{harvested}} {{by cutting}} the tree branches that hold <b>sticklac.</b> If dye is being produced, the insects {{are kept in}} the <b>sticklac</b> because the dye colour comes from the insects rather than their resin. They may be killed by exposure to the sun.|$|E
50|$|Timber {{products}} {{targeted for}} logging in Laos includes ironwood, mahogany, pine, redwood, and teak—and other forestry products—benzoin (resin), charcoal, and <b>sticklac.</b>|$|E
50|$|India {{exported}} {{significant amounts}} of <b>sticklac</b> derivatives, especially lac dye, from the 1700s to the late 1800s. Production declined as synthetic dyes emerged, and after the late 1940s, production of seedlac and shellac also declined due to replacement.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1950s, India {{annually}} produced about 50,000 tons of <b>sticklac</b> and exported about 29,000 tons of lac; by {{the late}} 1980s the figures were about 12,000 tons and 7,000 tons, respectively. By 1992-93, India's lac exports fell further to 4,500 tons. In the same period, Thailand's production increased somewhat, with annual lac exports of around 7,000 tons in the 1990s, mainly of seedlac. China exported only about 500 tons of shellac {{per year in the}} 1990s but produced more lac internally: 4,000-5,000 tons of <b>sticklac</b> and 2,000-3,000 tons of shellac in Yunnan province, with additional, smaller production in Fujian province. While India, Thailand, and China are the major lac producers, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka also play small roles.|$|E
50|$|Cultivation {{begins when}} a farmer gets a stick (broodlac) that {{contains}} eggs ready to hatch and ties {{it to the}} tree to be infested. Thousands of lac insects colonize {{the branches of the}} host trees and secrete the resinous pigment. The coated branches of the host trees are cut and harvested as <b>sticklac.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{harvested}} <b>sticklac</b> is {{crushed and}} sieved to remove impurities. The sieved material is then repeatedly washed to remove insect parts and other soluble material. The resulting product {{is known as}} seedlac. The prefix seed refers to its pellet shape. Seedlac which still contains 3-5% impurities is processed into shellac by heat treatment or solvent extraction.|$|E
5000|$|Pharmaceutical glaze is an alcohol-based {{solution}} {{of various types}} of food-grade shellac. The shellac {{is derived from the}} raw material <b>sticklac,</b> which is a resin scraped from the branches of trees left from when the small insect, Kerria lacca (also known as Laccifer lacca), creates a hard, waterproof cocoon. [...] When used in food and confections, it is also known as confectioner's glaze, resinous glaze, pure food glaze, natural glaze, or confectioner's resin.|$|E
50|$|Xe Bang Nouan (XBN) Protected Area was {{established}} on 29 October 1993 covering {{an area of}} 1260 km2, and extending over Salavan and Savanakhet Provinces. The topography of the reserve lies in the elevation range of 200-1000m; has flat to gently rolling terrain below400 m elevation {{in the north and}} south of the Bang Nouan River; the central part the river flows through gorges; and to the east of the hills is the wide valley of the river. The forests found are the evergreen, dry dipterocarp, mixed deciduous and other natural forest types, and about 87% of the area of the reserve is forested. Forest products of damar, fish and <b>sticklac</b> are exploited by the ethnic population living in the reserve for economic sustenance; they also have livestock and shifting cultivation practices.|$|E
40|$|Lac is {{secreted}} by Laccifer lacca kern {{that has}} been widely used as food coating materials. To get the best food coatings from lac, the <b>sticklac</b> which processed need to be converted to seedlac and further become shellac. It {{is one of the}} potential commodities in East Nusa Tenggara Timur Province. However, more work has to be done for improving its productivity as well as its quality...|$|E
40|$|Shellac is an {{essential}} raw material in various industries n Vietnam. It has unique combination of qualities which no single synthetic resin {{has so far been}} able to equal. The production of shellac is extremely low and stands at 50 tons per year against an internal demand of 500 tons. This imbalance {{is due to the fact}} that the cultivation methods applied are primitive without following any improved techniques and without carrying out basic research to step up production. It is mainly cultivated by different ethnic minorities on the mountains in the northwestern part of the country. These people also practise "shifting cultivation" for their subsistence. This practice has resulted in serious landslides, erosion, causing silting-up of rivers downstream. Realizing the seriousness of the adverse effects of erosion on the high mountain slopes and the poverty of the ethnic minorities, the Government took measures to assist these people by moving them to permanent settlements and encouraging them to increase production of lac thus contributing to raise their income, thereby improving their living standard. The development objective of the project was to fulfil the Government's plan to increase the production of lac and also to increase the income of the cultivators. Entomological and host tree laboratories were established in Hanoi and necessary equipment were installed. Research staff were given appropriate training locally by project experts and eight Vietnamese staff members were sent abroad for training on lac cultivation, pest control, growing host plants and lac processing. A number of research experiments were conducted on pest and fungal control in host plants, both on dwarf and tree types. Broodlac farms were established both in the north and the south, for production of healthy and disease free broodlac. Simple manual with instructions in Vietnamese on improved lac cultivation and production methods was developed and distributed to the staff and people in lac growing areas. The project made steady progress towards increased production of <b>sticklac</b> and established that lac cultivation can be extended successfully to central and southern regions of Vietnam. A shellac processing plant was built at Ha Dong and handed over to the Government after successful test runs. The quality of shellac produced were good and met the purity requirements needed. From what has been achieved by the project so far it can be concluded that Vietnam has the potential not only to meet its internal demand but to export lac and earn the much needed foreign exchange thus contributing to the national economy. It is recommended that broodlac farms should be established at appropriate locations in the north and the south to ensure steady supply of broodlac to farmers at a reasonable price to further improve shellac production. Adequate funding should be provided to ensure proper management of the host plant species identified by the project from the early stage of growing host plants to pruning, rearing of lac insect, harvesting of <b>sticklac,</b> and for the successful implementation of the recommendations made in activities related to research, development and extension...|$|E
40|$|The {{study has}} {{reported}} {{the impact of}} training on lac growers in terms of host utilization, livelihood conditions and income and employment generation. The study {{is based on the}} data collected from randomly selected 500 lac growers (trained and untrained) in the Ranchi and West Singhbhum districts of Jharkhand in the years 2003 - 04 and 2004 - 05. The host utilization has been found to increase significantly after training of lac growers in comparison to untrained lac-growers for all the three hosts, viz. palas (Butea monosperma), ber (Zizyphus mauritiana) and kusum (Schleichera oleosa). A significant shift from lower production group to higher production group has been observed by trained lac-growers. The share of lac income in total income has increased in the case of trained lac-growers from 18. 5 per cent to 24. 0 per cent. More employment generation and increase in net returns have been found in lac cultivation on all the three hosts for trained lac-growers. Higher level of broodlac (seed) production has resulted in self-sufficiency in broodlac and more utilization of host trees for lac cultivation. Higher BC ratio and reduction in cost of production of broodlac and <b>sticklac</b> have been found in trained than untrained lac-growers for lac cultivation on all the three hosts. The study has emphasized on the need of strengthening and widening the extension activity to empower the lac growers with scientific knowledge on lac cultivation for increasing their income level.

40|$|Abstract [...] The pure lac dye is {{obtained}} by dissolving technical grade lac dye in mild alkali for removal of insolubles, followed by acidification of the filtrate and finally keeping it for 8 days {{to complete the}} process of crystallization. The crystallized dye is filtered, washed and dried (yield approx. 0. 25 % on the weight of <b>sticklac,</b> Purity 95 % and above). The purified lac dye is bright reddish in colour and soluble in cold water. The pure lac dye has a great potential as a food additive for colouring food materials as it gives deep orange-red colour in aqueous solution like the colour of beverages and cold drinks available in market. Use of synthetic colours in the food products come to be looked upon with certain amount of apprehension {{with regard to their}} safety. Hence, lac dye could serve as a good substitute for the synthetic food colours. The potential of lac dye as food additive for colouring food material is further authenticated by the toxicological studies conducted at ITRC, Lucknow and AIIH&PH, Kolkata. The findings of these studies also support that the lac dye is non toxic at the limit test dose of 200 mg/kg diet i. e. 0. 02 % of the diet for acute oral toxicity as intake of lac dye 0. 02 % in diet for 90 days in male rats does not show any sign of toxic manifestation. Use of lac dye has been reported in China, Japan and Thailand as a colouring material in soft drinks and other products e. g., ham / sausages, jams and chowmin noodles etc. Keywords [...] Lac dye, Food additive, food colours I...|$|E
