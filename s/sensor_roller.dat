40|$|The work {{presented}} {{here is an}} approach in robotic deburring of two dimensional parts with unknown geometry. Two problems have been addressed in this paper: tracking the the part contour, {{and control of the}} metal removal process. The tracking mechanism is a roller bearing mounted on a force sensor at the robot endpoint. The tracking control employs the force measured by this force sensor to find the normal to the part surface, while the deburring algorithm uses another set of contact forces (cutting forces generated by the cutter) to develop a stable metal removal. A set of experimental results is given to verify the effectiveness of the approach. part 2 -D force <b>sensor</b> <b>roller</b> beanng 1...|$|E
30|$|The University of Cambridge and the British Rail Research [17] collaboratively {{developed}} {{the first model}} of CAT (Corrugation Analysis Trolley) in 1970 {{and then it was}} used in many railway infrastructures. This instrument, falling within the category of contact instrument, has a contact <b>sensor</b> (tip or <b>roller</b> <b>sensor)</b> and an odometer. The CAT works hand-pushed, riding the rail, allowing to detect the longitudinal profile {{on the surface of the}} rail with vertical precision of 0.01  μm [17]. This instrument, in addition to measuring the surface of the rail in terms of longitudinal profile, is able to return the acoustic roughness, the roughness of the rail connected to the generation of the noise (expressed in dB), and being provided with a dedicated software used for the calculation [23, 24, 25].|$|R
50|$|Roller brake testers {{consist of}} a {{mechanical}} floor unit which contains electrical motors, two independent sets of three measuring rollers, brake force transducers and additional safety <b>sensors.</b> The driving <b>rollers</b> operate at a low (known) speed using a gearbox and motor arrangement and during a test measurements of the maximum braking force are taken by applying the vehicle brakes which induces a reaction force on the electric motor itself. An electric transducer with strain gauges then measures the individual induced forces which are acting during the deceleration phase in order to calculate the individual braking forces for each wheel.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} goals of precision farming is preparing yield map. Recently in Iran, planting of corn has received special attention. Therefore, among the different methods of yield measurement such as using impact sensor at the outlet port of forage harvester (chopper), displacement <b>sensors</b> at feed <b>rollers</b> of forage harvester, continuous measurement of discharged material to trailing wagon and using the torque meter, the present study made use of the torque meter method. This method consisted of a torque transmitting shaft equipped with laser-based encoders to monitor twist in a real time mode. The unit output could be exported to a computer via a microcontroller installed into the interface device. For calibration of the torque meter output with material feed rate in lab conditions, a conveyor was used to feed homogenous amount of material at a specific rate to the chopper. The experiment was conducted at 3 feed rates of silage corn and at 3 feed roll speeds of the chopper with 3 replications. Correlation between the feed rate and recorded power at different gears of the chopper was established. Relationships between feed rate and recorded power of the chopper at gears 1, 2 and 3 were linear with calculated R 2 of 0. 95, 0, 98 and 0. 98, respectively...|$|R
