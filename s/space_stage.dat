25|$|Spore is a {{game that}} is {{separated}} into stages, each stage presenting {{a different type of}} experience with different goals to achieve. The five stages are the Cell Stage, the Creature Stage, the Tribal Stage, the Civilization Stage, and the <b>Space</b> <b>Stage.</b> Once the primary objective is completed, the player has the option to advance to the next stage, or to continue playing the current stage.|$|E
25|$|The player {{controls}} {{a single}} spaceship, {{built at the}} beginning of the <b>Space</b> <b>Stage.</b> The player can travel by clicking on other planets and moons and stars, though each jump costs energy. Later in the game, the player can purchase a wormhole key which enables them to travel through black holes, offering instant transportation to a sister black hole. There are around 500,000 planets in the game's galaxy orbiting around 100,000 stars (including Earth and its star, Sol).|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} goals in the <b>Space</b> <b>Stage</b> is for the player to push their way toward a supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center, which {{introduces}} the game's final antagonists, the Grox, a unique species of cybernetic aliens with a powerful empire of 2400 systems surrounding the core.Getting {{to the center of}} the galaxy and entering starts a cinematic in which the player is introduced to Steve. After the cinematic dialogue with Steve ends the player is shot out of the black hole, and gets rewarded with the Staff of Life.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2008, John Bohannon of Science {{magazine}} {{assembled a}} team to review the game's portrayal of evolution and other scientific concepts. Evolutionary biologists T. Ryan Gregory of the University of Guelph and Niles Elredge of the American Museum of Natural History reviewed the Cell and Creature stages. William Sims Bainbridge, a sociologist from the U.S. National Science Foundation, reviewed the Tribe and Civilization stages. NASA's Miles Smith reviewed the <b>Space</b> <b>Stage.</b> The Science team evaluated Spore on twenty-two subjects. The game's grades ranged from a single A in galactic structure and a B+ in sociology to Fs in mutation, sexual selection, natural selection, genetics, and genetic drift. In addition, Yale evolutionary biologists Thomas Near and Thomas Prum found Spore fun to play and admired its ability {{to get people to}} think about evolutionary questions, but consider the game's evolutionary mechanism to be [...] "severely messed up.". With this noted, study of how players make meaning with the game suggest that the game prompts more sophisticated thinking about evolution than the model the game presents.|$|E
