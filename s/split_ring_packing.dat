First {{of all the}} necessary symmetries required to guar-antee an isotropic behavior are analyzed. Secondly an homogenization procedure taking into account spatial dispersion is developed for magnetic <b>split</b> <b>ring</b> metamaterials. It is shown that this homogenization also accounts for all kind of waves (electromagnetic and magnetoinductive) previously reported in negative-µ <b>split</b> <b>ring</b> metamaterials. Finally, the possibility of developing isotropic NRI metamaterials from chiral <b>split</b> <b>ring</b> resonators (SRRs) is discussed in detail In spite of many efforts in this direction (see e. g.

40|$|The most {{difficult}} and challenging {{area for the}} tribology of reciprocating internal combustion engines to improve efficiency and life is the lubricant health within the piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack.</b> It is here where extreme temperatures, pressures and noxious gases interact with the small volume of lubricant {{designed to protect the}} components. There is a lack of knowledge of the correlation between the lubricant condition and its performance. This research is an original contribution to this field and addressed the influence of lubricant degradation on lubricant film thicknesses and residence times in the piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack.</b> A laser induced fluorescence (LIF) system was first implemented on an operating motored gasoline engine to examine the piston ring to cylinder wall lubricant film thickness. A bespoke optical setup was designed and developed with excellent spatial resolution incorporating an argon ion laser, operating at 488 nm, combined with photomultiplier tubes to measure reference laser and incoming fluorescent light via a sapphire window in the cylinder liner. Lubricants were doped with Pyrromethene 567 A fluorescent dye and the fluorescence signals were calibrated through a strict method, which allowed the fluorescence of degraded samples, and hence the lubricant film thickness, to be quantified. A range of degraded engine lubricant samples were acquired from Mercedes Benz, Leeds, UK and Southwest Research Institute, Texas, USA. The LIF system was then adapted and transferred to a high speed, fired Ricardo Hydra single cylinder gasoline engine. The capability of the LIF system was finally extended to examine lubricant flow in the piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> through a novel tracer technique, which enabled direct measurement of piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> lubricant residence time. A LIF system was developed that could clearly distinguish between lubricants of different viscosities and degradation state. It was found that degraded lubricants, with increased viscosity compared to fresh lubricant, produce thicker lubricant films in the piston ring to cylinder wall interface, which would directly impact on engine efficiency. Additionally, it was found that engine speed, load and lubricant viscosity influence the piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> lubricant residence time and the replenishment of the lubricant within the piston <b>ring</b> <b>pack...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the liquid fuel in the intake manifold, the <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> crevices and the oil film on the {{unburned}} hydrocarbon (HC) emissions of a spark-ignited, carbureted, air-cooled V-twin engine was studied. Tests were performed {{for a range of}} engine load, two engine speeds, various air-fuel ratio and with a fixed ignition timing. To isolate liquid fuel effects due to the poor atomization and vaporization of the fuel when using a carburetor, a specially conditioned homogeneous, pre-vaporized mixture system (HMS) was developed. The results from carburetor and HMS are compared. To verify the existence of liquid fuel in the manifold, and to obtain an estimate of its mass, a carburetor-mounted liquid fuel injection (CMLFI) system was also implemented. Stop-injection tests performed with the CMFLI system show that 60 - 80 cycles worth of liquid fuel is held in the intake manifold depending on operating condition. The results of the comparison show that the liquid fuel in the intake manifold does not have a statistically significant influence on the averaged HC emissions. In addition, the cycle-resolved HC emissions for both systems follow the same trends and are comparable in magnitude. Heat release analysis showed little difference between fuel mixture delivery system. These results suggest that under steady state operation the HC emissions for this engine are not sensitive to the presence of liquid fuel in the intake manifold. The <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> contribution to the engine-out HC emissions was estimated using a simplified <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> gas flow model; the model was tested against the experimentally measured blowby. The tests were performed using the homogeneous fuel mixture system. The integrated mass of HC leaving the crevices from the end of combustion (the crank angle that the cumulative burn fraction reached 90 %) to exhaust valve closing was taken to represent the potential contribution of the <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> to the overall HC emissions; post-oxidation in the cylinder will consume some of this mass. Time-resolved exhaust HC concentration measurements were also performed, and the instantaneous HC mass flow rate was determined using the measured exhaust and cylinder pressure. At high load the model predicts that the <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> returns approximately three times as much HC mass to the cylinder as is measured in the exhaust, indicating that the HC emissions are dominated by the <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> contribution. At the lightest load condition tested, the <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> model predicts less mass returning to the cylinder from the <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> than is observed in the exhaust, clearly indicating that another HC mechanism is significantly contributing to the exhaust HC emissions. The integrated exhaust HC mass from the time-resolved HC measurement was found to correlate inversely with the IMEP on a cycle-by-cycle basis, which strongly suggest that incomplete combustion is materially contributing to the exhaust HC emissions. A statistical analysis showed that the correlation was significant. The intermediate load condition represents a combination of these two extremes. The ensemble-average <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> model results indicate that the mass returned to the cylinder from the <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> is slightly higher than the amount measured in the exhaust. But, a conditional sampling analysis indicates that there are sub-groups, i. e. late-burning cycles, for which this is not true. There is expected to be some in-cylinder post-oxidation of the <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> HC mass at this condition, and the late burning cycles were not found to excessively contribute to the HC emissions, which both strongly suggests that there are other mechanisms besides the <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> that are significantly contributing to the HC emissions at this condition. The most likely mechanism is incomplete combustion. The contribution of fuel adsorption in engine oil and its subsequent desorption following combustion to the engine-out hydrocarbon (HC) emissions was studied by comparing steady state and cycle-resolved HC emission measurements from operation with a standard full-blend gasoline, and with propane, which has a low solubility in oil. Experiments were performed at two speeds and three loads, and for different mean crankcase pressures. The crankcase pressure was found to impact the HC emissions, presumably through the ringpack mechanism, which was largely unaltered by the different fuels. The average and cycle-resolved HC emissions were found to be in good agreement, both qualitatively and quantitatively, for the two fuels. Further, the two fuels showed the same response to changes in the crankcase pressure. The experiments were supported by a numerical analysis. The simulation of the liquid-gas phase equilibrium of the fuel-oil system showed the solubility of propane in the oil was approximately an order of magnitude lower than for gasoline. Further the numerical analysis of the adsorption-desorption of the fuel in the oil along the cycle showed that the oil layer contribution is very small compared with the <b>ring</b> <b>pack</b> contribution. This suggests that the effect of fuel adsorption in the oil is not significant for small air-cooled utility-type engines...|$|R
