50|$|Engines with manual {{transmission}} {{usually have a}} heavy flywheel, typically 5 to 10 kg of cast iron, with the <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> shrunk onto the outside. This is done by heating the ring to around 200 °C to expand the ring which is then placed onto the flywheel, often held in firmly against a location shoulder until cool. The interference fit renders the starter ring firmly attached to the flywheel. Engines with automatic transmissions instead have a pressed steel plate with the <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> usually welded onto {{the outside of the}} plate.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn general {{technical}} applications, truck {{heavy duty}} engine flywheel <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> teeth is conventionally induction {{hardened and tempered}} {{in order to meet}} metallurgical aspects on specification. Especially for large sectioned <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> (in this case diameter of the gear is 470 mm) the critical issue is to maintain a stable hardness distribution on gear cross sections. These hardness variations in process could yield to: 1. High scrap costs due to out of specification parts. 2. Increase in tact time in process, decrease in labor efficiency due to scrap rate and excessive hardness measurements. 3. Potential risk of failure on engine in low mileages. 4. 100 % hardness measurements in ongoing process which leads to time and cost waste. This technical paper summarizes the case study conducted for truck flywheel <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> with diameter of 470 mm in order to reduce hardness variation by optimization of induction hardening and tempering processes...|$|R

40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a carrier-less, anti-backlash {{planetary gear system}} that has an input sun gear, a force-balancing and planet-alignment 'speeder' gear above the sun <b>gear,</b> a split <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> that has a fixed lower <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> coaxial with the sun gear and a rotating upper <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> also coaxial with the sun gear. A preload bolt is used for securing the split <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> together. Within the split <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> is an even number of planet gears between the split <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> and the sun gear. Each planet gear consists of an upper planet gear, and lower planet gear with {{the upper and lower}} planet gears splined together and pushed apart by a spring which causes separation and relative twist between the upper and lower planet gears. The lower planet gear meshes with the input sun gear and the fixed <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> while the upper planet gear is driven by the lower planet gear and meshes with the rotating <b>ring</b> <b>gear...</b>|$|R
50|$|Shotgun {{starters}} {{are composed}} of a breech, into which the cartridge is inserted, which {{is connected to the}} motor by a short steel pipe, which acts like a gun barrel. The blank cartridge fits into the breech, and is triggered either electrically or mechanically. When the aircraft's ignition is turned on and the cartridge is fired, high-velocity, high-pressure gas (~ at ~600 ft/s) shoots down the pipe, forcing the motor to spin and engage the <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> on the engine, which is attached to the crankshaft.|$|E
50|$|A <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear,</b> {{sometimes}} called a starter ring or ring gear, is a {{medium carbon steel}} ring with teeth that is fitted {{on the periphery of}} a flexplate or flywheel of an internal combustion engine, mostly for automotive or aircraft applications. The teeth of the starter ring are driven by the smaller gear (the pinion) of the starter motor. The primary function of the starter ring is to transfer torque from the starter motor pinion to the flywheel or flexplate to rotate the engine to begin the cycle.|$|E

The modern starter motor is either a permanent-magnet or a series-parallel wound direct current electric motor with a starter solenoid (similar to a relay) mounted on it. When DC power from the starting battery is applied to the solenoid, usually through a key-operated switch (the [...] "ignition switch"), the solenoid engages a lever that pushes out the drive pinion on the starter driveshaft and meshes the pinion with the <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> on the flywheel of the engine.|$|E

5000|$|This {{rotation}} of the planet gears can in turn drive the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> (not depicted in diagram), in a corresponding ratio. If the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> has N teeth, then the ring will rotate by N/N turns for each turn of the planet gears. For instance, if the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> has 64 teeth, and the planets 16, one clockwise turn of a planet gear results in 16/64, or 1/4 clockwise turns of the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> Extending this case from the one above: ...|$|R
50|$|Shotgun {{starters}} {{had several}} advantages over other starting systems in {{use at the}} time. Electric starters required large, heavy, and often troublesome batteries to be carried on board, or external charging equipment had to be located at every place where the vehicle was anticipated to operate. Inertia starters used a heavy wheel, usually made of brass, which was spun by a hand crank or electric motor, causing the spinning wheel to engage the <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> The Coffman system was more lightweight and compact than inertial starters or internal batteries, {{and it did not}} require any special auxiliary equipment, an important feature when operating in remote areas.|$|E
50|$|The <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> is most {{commonly}} made by forming {{a length of}} square or rectangular steel bar into a circle and welding the ends together. There then follow various operations such as normalising (to remove stresses and improve the properties in the weld area), turning, generating the teeth by gear hobbing and finally a heat-treatment operation(s). The teeth of the starter ring need to be hardened {{in order to increase}} their strength and resist wear. The normal hardness at pitch circle diameter is 45-55 HRC. The body of the ring is generally left untreated which gives some ductility for shrinking onto a flywheel or welding to a flexplate.|$|E

It uses a three-element, welded assembly 10 in diameter torque converter mounted remotely on the rear face of the differential, (that also incorporates the <b>starter</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear,</b> and a centrifugal fan baffle for cooling, via slots in the engine bellhousing) and is driven directly from the engine crankshaft by a flexplate inside the engine bellhousing. The selector quadrant is arranged R-N-D-L, or Reverse, Neutral, Drive and Low, with no [...] "Park" [...] (except in Pontiac's 1963 version, redesigned to handle the increased torque of a new V8 engine in Tempest and LeMans, added {{by means of a}} separate lever).

50|$|In {{discussing}} the spur gear differential, {{the use of}} the term <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> is a convenient way to distinguish the sun gears of the two epicyclic gear trains. The second sun gear serves the same purpose as the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> of a simple planetary gear train, but clearly does not have the internal gear mate that is typical of a <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
30|$|The typical {{vibration}} modes also {{arise if}} the elastic components {{such as the}} thin <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> are considered [11, 12]. Wu and Parker [11] examined the PGT with elastic <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> and identified the rigid-elastic vibration modes, and later Parker and Wu [12] proved the vibration modes of the PGT with unequally-spaced planets and elastic <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> Tanna and Lim [15, 16] examined the <b>ring</b> <b>gear’s</b> free vibration and proved the elastic vibration modes, including in-plane extensional, radial inextensional, out-of-plane bending, and torsional deformations. It seems that similar modes to those in Refs. [11, 12] can be found for the helical planetary <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> even when considering various deformations owing to the symmetries. However, {{it could be a}} challenge to develop an analytical model incorporating many deformations. Even so, the theoretical analysis is another difficulty to be overcome.|$|R

40|$|The {{strain of}} the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> can reflect the dynamic {{characteristics}} of planetary gearboxes directly, which makes it an ideal signal to monitor the health condition of the gearbox. To overcome the disadvantages of traditional methods, a new approach for the dynamic measurement of <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> strains using fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the installation of FBGs is determined according to the analysis for the strain distribution of the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> Secondly, {{the parameters of the}} FBG are determined in consideration of the accuracy and sensitivity of the measurement as well as the size of the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> The strain measured by the FBG is then simulated under non-uniform strain field conditions. Thirdly, a dynamic measurement system is built and tested. Finally, the strains of the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> are measured in a planetary gearbox under normal and faulty conditions. The experimental results showed good agreement with the theoretical results in values, trends, and the fault features {{can be seen from the}} time domain of the measured strain signal, which proves that the proposed method is feasible for the measurement of the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> strains of planetary gearboxes...|$|R
50|$|The Bendix system {{places the}} starter drive pinion on a helical drive spring. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia {{of the drive}} pinion {{assembly}} causes it to wind the spring forcing {{the length of the}} spring to change and engage with the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> When the engine starts, backdrive from the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> causes the drive pinion to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive pinion is forced back and out of mesh with the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|Shutting off {{the engine}} caused the {{transmission}} oil pressure to rapidly dissipate. If the selector lever was in reverse or moved to reverse after the engine stopped, two mechanical parts combined to provide a parking brake. The reverse unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> was held stationary by the reverse anchor. The drive shaft could still turn causing the reverse unit sun gear and attached rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> to rotate {{at a very high}} speed, {{were it not for the}} fact that the rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> band was now applied by a heavy spring. Usually, bands are applied by a servo and released by spring pressure, but in this case, the band was held off by the servo and applied by spring pressure (actually, when the engine was running, the band was applied by a combination of spring pressure assisted by oil pressure). With the engine off, this brake band acting on the rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> had a tremendous mechanical advantage. Since the rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> with its attached reverse unit sun gear and the reverse unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> were both locked to the transmission case, the planet carriers and driveshaft could not turn. As such, it provided an effective driveshaft mounted parking brake to be used alone or supplementing the hand brake.|$|R

40|$|Phase-oriented gear {{systems are}} {{differential}} planetary transmissions {{in which each}} planet gear has two sets of unequal numbers of teeth indexed at prescribed relative angles (phases). The figure illustrates an application of the phase-oriented gearing concept to a relatively simple speed-reducing differential planetary transmission that includes a sun gear, an idler gear, three identical planet gears, a ground internal <b>ring</b> <b>gear,</b> and an output internal <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> Typically, the ground internal <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> and output internal <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> have different numbers of teeth, giving rise to a progressive and periodic phase shift between the corresponding pairs of teeth engaged by each successive planet gear.

50|$|From 1939-1950, {{the reverse}} anchor {{was used to}} lock the reverse unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> from turning by {{engaging}} external teeth machined into that <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> From 1951 on, a cone clutch {{did the same thing}} when oil pressure was up, and a spring-loaded parking pawl was allowed to lock the same <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> in the absence of oil pressure. This worked better as the anchor would not grind on the external teeth if that <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> were turning (that is, unless the engine stalled as reverse was engaged). Reverse was obtained by applying torque from the front unit (band on, in reduction) through the fluid coupling to the rear unit sun gear. The planet carrier of this gearset was splined to the planet carrier of the reverse unit. The rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> hub had a small gear machined on its end which served as the reverse unit sun gear. Because the rear unit band was not applied for reverse, the rear unit and reverse unit compounded causing the combined planet carriers to rotate opposite to the input torque and at a further reduced speed. The output shaft was machined onto the rear unit and reverse unit planet carriers.|$|R

50|$|This overrunning-clutch pinion {{arrangement}} was phased into use {{beginning in the}} early 1960s; before that time, a Bendix drive was used. The Bendix system places the starter drive pinion on a helically cut drive shaft. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia of the drive pinion assembly causes it to ride forward on the helix and thus engage with the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> When the engine starts, backdrive from the <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> causes the drive pinion to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive pinion is forced back down the helical shaft and thus out of mesh with the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
25|$|Epicyclic gears {{are also}} called {{planetary}} gears because the axes {{of the planet}} gears revolve around the common axis {{of the sun and}} <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> that they mesh with and roll between.

5000|$|Some designs use [...] "stepped-planet" [...] {{which have}} two differently-sized gears on {{either end of}} a common casting. The large end engages the sun, while the small end engages the <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> This may be {{necessary}} to achieve smaller step changes in gear ratio when the overall package size is limited. Compound planets have [...] "timing marks" [...] (or [...] "relative gear mesh phase" [...] in technical term). The assembly conditions of compound planetary gears are more restrictive than simple planetary gears, and they must be assembled in the correct initial orientation relative to each other, or their teeth will not simultaneously engage the sun and <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> at opposite ends of the planet, leading to very rough running and short life. Compound planetary gears can easily achieve larger transmission ratio with equal or smaller volume. For example, compound planets with teeth in a 2:1 ratio with a 50T <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> would give the same effect as a 100T <b>ring</b> <b>gear,</b> but with half the actual diameter.|$|R
