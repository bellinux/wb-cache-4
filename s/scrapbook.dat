Chuck admits to Serena and Dan {{that he has}} {{secretly}} been altering Nate and Blair’s Prom night in order to recreate the scenes from Blair's Prom <b>scrapbook.</b> Meanwhile, Blair feels disconcerted while dancing with Nate and ends their relationship {{by the end of}} the night. Blair explains to Serena that after completing high school with Nate, he feels like simply a high school boyfriend. The girls reminisce about growing up together through crazy times, like sisters. Lily apologizes to Rufus and CeCe. Rufus expresses concern that Lily is too unpredictable and too much like her mother. CeCe remains indifferent, but agrees to return to Lily's home.|$|E
5|$|To prove {{she is able}} {{to handle}} her own affairs, Serena refuses to leave jail with either Lily or CeCe (Caroline Lagerfelt) {{although}} Lily drops the charges on which she had Serena arrested. Rufus (Matthew Settle) is also angry with Lily for Serena's arrest; Dan (Penn Badgley) and Jenny (Taylor Momsen) inform Vanessa (Jessica Szohr) that Rufus returned home without proposing to Lily, and he has remained in his bedroom ever since. Lily feuds with CeCe for telling Rufus about their lovechild. From jail, Serena encourages Blair (Leighton Meester) to enjoy prom with Nate (Chace Crawford) in the way Blair had chronicled in a <b>scrapbook</b> as a preteen, but each of the couple’s prom plans, such as the limo, hotel reservation and Blair's dress, inexplicably go awry. Nate suspects Chuck (Ed Westwick) of sabotaging the prom in an effort to win Blair back, but Chuck denies involvement. Dan convinces Serena to allow him to pay her bail and escort her to the Prom.|$|E
5|$|Murder on the Orient Express, as {{with its}} predecessor, {{features}} an inventory system. There are several {{components of the}} inventory, including a fingerprint examination screen, a <b>scrapbook,</b> and a passport screen for managing and viewing the passengers' passports. There are a total of eighty slots for carrying items in the inventory, spread across five separate screens. Items cannot be discarded from the inventory once they have been acquired. The player can access the inventory by clicking on an icon on the game's interface, or can simply right-click. After items are used, a right-click returns them to the inventory, and the exact slot they were originally placed in. Each item is labelled, and the player can inspect each inventory item in more detail by dragging it over a magnifying glass icon, and can also listen for a soft hissing sound which indicates {{that there is something}} relevant for the player to note about a certain item. In a divergence from other games in its genre, Murder on the Orient Express does not allow the player to combine items in the main inventory screen. There is a separate interface for item combinations, and the player must drag items into this screen if they wish to try to combine them.|$|E

Along with Shirley, they track Babe down to a caravan in Ramsgate, where Babe states she was evicted from her house. Later, Shirley discovers a <b>scrapbook</b> of photos of young pregnant girls with due dates written on the back and realises that Babe and Queenie had kidnapped these girls and had their babies adopted out. Shirley is disgusted by Babe's actions and threatens to set her fire to her caravan, but Mick stops her.

Linda's mother, Elaine Peacock (Maria Friedman), and her toyboy fiancé, Jason Adams (Scott Neal), temporarily move into the Vic. Babe does not trust Jason, although they have a passionate encounter, which is caught by Mick and Linda. Linda asks Babe to ensure Jason leaves Walford without informing Elaine of the reason, but when Elaine teases Babe, she reveals that she had sex with Jason. Elaine refuses to believe this, while Jason suggests that he and Babe steal from the pub and leave together. Babe secretly records the conversation and plays it to the Carters, who force Jason to leave. Babe admits to Elaine and Linda that she and Jason did not have sex and that she feels lonely.

5|$|The {{taxi driver}} and his {{companion}} hold Homer hostage {{deep into the}} rainforest. They force Homer {{to make a phone}} call to Marge, telling her that if the family provides 50,000 dollars to the kidnappers, he will be released. However, the Simpsons do not have enough money so they go looking for Homer instead. Walking through the streets of Rio de Janeiro, they run into a parade that features a Teleboobies float with characters from the show. Lisa is surprised to discover that Ronaldo is working inside the costume of the dancing flamingo from Teleboobies—a well-paid job he got after learning to dance with the shoes he bought with Lisa's donation money. Ronaldo tells Lisa that he stopped writing to her because he did not know which state she lives in, since it was the orphanage that used to send his letters. Later, Ronaldo gives the Simpsons the money they need to save Homer. Meanwhile, Homer shows the kidnappers a <b>scrapbook</b> he made of his kidnapping memories. Apparently, he has developed Stockholm syndrome. The family and the kidnappers then meet up high over a valley near the Sugarloaf Mountain in two separate cable cars. The Simpsons toss the kidnappers their money, and when Homer jumps into his family's cable car, the cables break, sending the family crashing into the mountainside and rolling down to the ground. They all survive unharmed, but Bart is then eaten whole by an anaconda. The episode ends with Bart dancing inside the snake to carnival music.|$|E
5|$|Following Connor {{receiving}} Delia's corneas, Chloe {{began to}} become more attached to him. Unbeknownst to Chelsea and Kevin, Chloe's attachment becomes unhealthy, especially when Kevin finds that Chloe included photographs of Connor in Delia's baby <b>scrapbook.</b> While Billy goes to grief counseling, Chloe refuses and says she is handling her grief from Delia's death by herself. When it is revealed that Chelsea's husband Adam in fact struck Delia with his car that night and is later presumed dead, Chloe becomes increasingly angry with Chelsea and {{goes so far as}} blaming her for Delia's death. Afterward, Chloe breaks down at a fundraiser event for a foundation in Delia's name and goes into Chelsea's home (who had initially planned on moving to Paris with Adam and Connor), takes Connor and Chelsea's passport and poses as her at the airport, where she intends on flying to Paris with Connor and starting a new life. Chelsea and Kevin meet Chloe and Connor in Paris, where she comes to terms with what she's done. Back in Genoa City, Chloe is arrested for kidnapping and is given the choice of psychiatric inpatient or outpatient treatment. Wanting outpatient treatment, she has to be placed under a conservatorship, and not wanting it to be under Esther, Kevin proposes to her and they abruptly marry again. Not considering their reunion to be genuine, Chloe refuses to consummate her marriage with Kevin, hurting him. Despite Chelsea and Chloe making up, she is offended when Chelsea registers a restraining order against her, keeping her away from Connor. They later appear to make up, but Chloe still harbors anger for her and tears up one of the dresses Chelsea designed for a Jabot fashion shoot. Despite receiving treatment, Chloe decides that she wants another child to replace Delia, however not fathered by Kevin but by Billy. She asks Billy for his sperm so she can be inseminated and become pregnant, but he immediately refuses and alerts Chelsea, Kevin and her other loved ones. While they plan an intervention, Chloe goes to the sperm bank at the hospital and is able to steal a specimen of sperm that Billy donated when {{he was trying to get}} pregnant with his wife, Victoria. She is blindsided by what her loved ones propose, which is getting treatment from a psychiatric facility. Kevin also accepted that he can't give Chloe the help she needs and Chloe accepts that she needs help. She chooses a facility in California, the night before leaving, she and Kevin make love one last time. She leaves town soon after, having had heartfelt goodbyes with her friends and family. However, she reveals that she still has Billy's sperm in her bag before leaving town. Soon after, Kevin sends her flowers, but she refuses them, and asks that Kevin not visit her, devastating him.|$|E

After an initial experimental period spanning the late 1950 s to the mid 1960 s he concentrated his artistic efforts on directing, choreographing and teaching buto using his own creative system, called buto-fu or "buto <b>scrapbooks.</b> "Like many visual artists Hijikata collected and arranged existing (found) images and composed sixteen <b>scrapbooks.</b> The <b>scrapbooks</b> served Hijikata as a medium to create, explore and reflect on his buto. While making up his <b>scrapbooks</b> Hijikata applied established fine art techniques such as collage, montage and pastiche to isolate, emphasize or synthesize visual and artistic qualities of the images.
