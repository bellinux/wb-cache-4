3000|$|We have {{presented}} {{an analysis of}} an electroosmotic flow model with slip boundary conditions and its adjoint. The slip boundary conditions require the evaluation of potential derivatives on the boundary, which increases the regularity requirements on the potential. We emphasize that a naive enforcement of the <b>standard</b> <b>slip</b> boundary condition leads to an ill-posed adjoint problem (see Section [...] "Ill-posedness of the adjoint problem for the naive formulation"). This leads to instabilities in the computed adjoint, illustrated by numerical experiments in Section [...] "Results and discussion". A well-posed adjoint problem {{can be obtained by}} modifying the slip boundary condition (u+λ∇Φ= 0), i.e. specifying the normal velocity at the wall independently of the potential (u•n= 0,u•t+λ∇Φ•t= 0).|$|E

In this case, a shipboard application is examined. A hardware demonstration of a control architecture is implemented, along with a benchtop demonstration of the replacement of <b>standard</b> <b>slip</b> rings in the machine with a contactless solution (i. e. a transformer). Along with the benchtop demonstration of the transformer for accessing the rotor terminals, an analysis of the power handling capability of different converters for rectifying the power from the transformer for use with the electric machine is performed. A half bridge, full bridge, asymmetrical PWM half bridge, and asymmetrical PWM full bridge converter are all examined in terms of feasibility and power handling capability in simulation. A comparison of the modeled power transfer capability and the actual power handling capability of a half and a full bridge converter is also presented. by Michael S. Tomovich. Thesis: S.

40|$|Slips, {{trips and}} falls are major causitive factors for {{occupational}} and non-occupational falls. Alternative footwear such has crocs and flip flops {{have been used}} in and around work places and communities that can be slip prone environments. The purpose of the study is to analyze the effects of alternative footwear [crocs (CC), flip-flops (FF) ] and industry <b>standard</b> <b>slip</b> resistant shoes (LT) on ground reaction forces (GRFs) during slip events. Eighteen healthy male participants following a repeated measures design for each footwear condition, were tested for heel kinematics during normal dry surface gait (NG); unexpected slip (US), alert slip (AS) and expected slip (ES). A 3 x 4 repeated measures ANOVA was used to analyze the dependent vertical GRFs parameters (Mean Z-GRF and Peak Z-GRF) at p = 0. 05. Significant interactions between footwear and gait trials were found for Mean Z-GRF and significant main effect in gait trials for Peak Z-GRF were evident. On average significantly lower GRFs were seen in slip trials compared to normal gait. FF exhibited significantly lower GRFs during slip trials while LT demonstrated lower GRFs in normal gait. The reduced ground reaction forces during all slip events compared to normal gait {{can be attributed to the}} incomplete weight transfer on the slipping foot during the unexpected and alert slips and to the anticipation of the slippery environment in expected slips. Flip flops which had greater incidence of slips also demonstrated reduced GRFs compared to CC and LT during slip events, further suggesting incomplete weight transfer, while during normal gait, LT demonstrated reduced GRFs compared to alternative footwear owing to its cushioning midsole properties. The LT with lowest incidence of slips demonstrates to be the choice of footwear for maneuvering slippery flooring conditions and for reducing impact reaction forces during non-slippery flooring conditions.

40|$|Since 1974, {{governments have}} created a series of {{statutory}} public involvement institutions in the English NHS: Community Health Councils; Patient and Public Involvement Forums; Local Involvement Networks; and, from 2013, local Healthwatch. This study presents the role of these institutions as a puzzle, given the growth of alternative forms of public involvement. Public involvement in the NHS tends to be studied for its contribution to democratising the NHS or for its role in a choice-led consumer market, but these analyses generally focus on involvement led by NHS personnel or by independent patient organisations. This dissertation uses a different body of political science theory to assess roles that statutory public involvement institutions may play in Ministers’ political management of the NHS. One approach is to see these institutions as ‘sheepdogs’, rounding up and organising diverse groups, thus providing a form of corporatist interest intermediation. Alternatively, they could be ‘watchdogs’, raising the alarm when <b>standards</b> <b>slip</b> critically and thereby helping to safeguard the NHS against disasters. The explanatory value of these two interpretations is reviewed over the period 1974 - 2010, using policy documents and archive material, including the records of these organisations and the archives of public inquiries into problems in hospitals. The findings suggest that at various times national political actors have used statutory public involvement institutions to manage the representation and mobilisation of interests and to alert them to problems in local health services. There is more recent evidence for the watchdog than for the sheepdog role. The watchdog role has been reappraised following the failure of statistical monitoring and regulatory police patrols to prevent disasters in the NHS. The discussion also shows how the sheepdog powers of these institutions mean that they can round up opposition, rather than moderating it, resulting in Ministerial reforms to statutory public involvement institutions...|$|R

50|$|OEM {{machinery}} {{manufacturers are}} discovering {{the benefits of}} using a mercury swivel commutator in their designs. For example packaging machines use some type of commutator or slip ring as {{a connection to the}} moving parts that are heated to seal the packages closed after they are filled. It is critical that the temperature sensing circuit be reliable and accurate. Unfortunately, using a slip ring assembly or <b>standard</b> electrical <b>slip</b> ring may cause problems due to electrical noise and degradation of signal produced by the rubbing contacts of the slip rings. Many OEM machinery manufacturers have switched to using mercury swivel commutators for reliable and accurate temperature control. It is also desirable to pass the power and the temperature signal through the same rotating electrical connector in order to minimize the number of connector parts that must be built into the machine. Multiple channel mercury swivel commutators are used for this purpose.|$|R

5000|$|The Telstar 28 has {{a number}} of {{distinguishing}} features, when comparing to the earlier versions as well as other foldable trimarans. Most notable is the folding mechanism for the amas. The amas fold in, by swiveling in and out alongside the main hull, reducing the beam from 18 ft to 8 ft 6 in, without extending the boat's overall length. The amas submerse approximately an additional four inches when retracted but retain their orientation to the main hull, so no additional surface is exposed to fouling if the amas were painted for the retracted waterline. This allows the boat to be berthed in a <b>standard</b> marina <b>slip</b> for extended period of time, eliminating one of the main problems facing trimaran owners.

40|$|Seismic {{anisotropy}} in the Earth's lowermost mantle (D?) {{is often}} {{attributed to the}} alignment of MgSiO 3 post-perovskite (ppv) by the movement of dislocations in response to mantle flow.

Unlike previous approaches, completely general, 3 -D flow and full anisotropy are permitted, yielding more information to compare with observations than has been possible before. We model observations of anisotropy in D?by calculating the shear wave splitting predicted in ScS waves for a series of models of ppv plasticity.

This boundary condition contains an arbitrary index parameter, denoted by n> 0, which appears in the coefficients of the ordinary differential equation to be solved. The case of a boundary layer formed in a convergent channel with a sink, which corresponds to n= 1 / 2, is solved analytically. Another analytical but non-unique solution is found corresponding to the value n= 1 / 3, while other values of n for n> 1 / 2 correspond to the boundary layer formed in the flow past a wedge and are solved numerically. It is found that for fixed slip length the velocity components are reduced in magnitude as n increases, while for fixed n the velocity components are increased in magnitude as the slip length is increased...|$|R
