40|$|The new {{development}} of a one-sided nonlinear adaptive shift estimation technique (NADSET) is introduced. The background of the algorithm and {{a brief overview of}} NADSET are presented. The new technique is applied to the wind parameter estimates from a 2 -micron wavelength coherent Doppler lidar system called VALIDAR located in NASA Langley Research Center in Virginia. The new technique enhances wind parameters such as Doppler shift and power estimates in low Signal-To-Noise-Ratio (SNR) regimes using the estimates in high SNR regimes as the algorithm <b>scans</b> the <b>range</b> <b>bins</b> from low to high altitude. The original NADSET utilizes the statistics in both the lower and the higher <b>range</b> <b>bins</b> to refine the wind parameter estimates in between. The results of the two different approaches of NADSET are compared...|$|R

40|$|International audienceADM-Aeolus, {{the wind}} Lidar under {{development}} at ESA, is a High Spectral Resolution Lidar that additionally provides separated information on particles (Mie channel) and molecules (Rayleigh channel). Lidar signals will be accumulated in vertical <b>range</b> <b>bins</b> {{in order to}} reach sufficient signal-to-noise ratio for reliable wind estimates. The vertical <b>range</b> <b>bin</b> integration may vary from 250 mnear the surface up to 2 kmin the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Significant attenuation in a <b>range</b> <b>bin</b> changes the nature of the retrieval problem. The commonly used Lidar inversion techniques appear to be inadequate to process bin-accumulated signals. This paper presents the ‘L 2 A processor', conceived to use ADM-Aeolus signals to provide information on aerosol and cloud layers optical properties. The altitude, geometrical depth, optical depth, backscatter-to-extinction ratio and scattering ratio are to be retrieved. The L 2 A processor algorithms provide a new formulation to the inverse problem for various filling cases of a <b>range</b> <b>bin</b> and it includes a credibility criterion (CC) in order to select the best filling approximation. The effective vertical resolution can be two to four times better than the ADM-Aeolus <b>range</b> <b>bins.</b> The basic concept, the processing algorithms, numerical examples and sensitivity tests are here presented...|$|R

In this paper, there is a matrix of polarimetric measurements corresponding to each <b>range</b> <b>bin,</b> and it is composed of the data of the <b>range</b> <b>bin</b> and adjacent <b>range</b> <b>bin,</b> which covers approximately 1  km 2. Therefore, the matrix of 21 [*]×[*] 21  × 4 can reflect the precipitation information of the current <b>range</b> <b>bin.</b> The system used the deep learning algorithm to extract the features from the matrix of polarimetric measurements, {{and the results are}} sent into the Softmax classifier to identify the precipitation pattern. Then, the fuzzy logic method is applied to judge the type of precipitation particles based on the precipitation pattern which was known. Finally, the optimal identification results of hydrometeor type can be obtained. The deep learning method is used for initial clustering, and then, the fuzzy logic method is used for accurate clustering; the result shows that it can improve the hydrometeor classification accuracy significantly.|$|R

It faces severe radio frequency interference (RFI) problem. In this paper, a theoretical analysis of the range-domain correlation of RFI in OFDM-based HF radar is presented.

40|$|Abstract—In inverse {{synthetic}} aperture radar (ISAR) imaging, micro-motion structures on the target will induce additional time-varying frequency modulations to the radar echoes. Due to the disturbance of these mechanical vibration or rotation parts, {{it will be difficult}} to obtain a well-focused ISAR image of the target using conventional translational motion compensation methods. To solve this problem, two improved translational motion compensation techniques have been proposed in this paper. Firstly, the power transform is used in the <b>range</b> <b>bin</b> alignment processing to depress the disturbance of the micro-motion parts. Then, an improved autofocusing methods based on <b>range</b> <b>bins</b> selection is presented, which only uses the <b>range</b> <b>bins</b> of the radar returns from the main body scatterers for the phase adjustment. The imaging results from the measured data are given to verify the validity of the improved translational motion compensation techniques proposed in this paper. 1...|$|R

40|$|An {{airborne}} pulse Doppler radar {{depends on}} a combination of range selectivity and velocity selectivity to detect targets in ground cluttsr. In principle clutter sensitivity can be reduced by employing higher bandwidths for greater range resolution. However at a sufficiently high bandwidth the phenomenon of <b>range</b> <b>bin</b> migration occurs which precludes the use of conventional Doppler processing. Here: the product of the range-rate and the coherent integration pericd exceeds the range resolution.
