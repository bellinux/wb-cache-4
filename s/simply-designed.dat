This would make GLONASS compatible with GPS, GALILEO and Compass receivers, which also use the CDMA method. A change in the GLONASS system from its current FDMA technique to the GPS and Galileo's format would enable a <b>simply-designed</b> receiver to use multiple satellite systems simultaneously.|$|E

This interior remains important in demonstrating the aesthetic possibilities of <b>simply-designed,</b> small timber churches of this era.|$|E
50|$|Vasegaard's {{functional}} stoneware {{bowls and}} vases are lightly coloured and simply decorated with restrained patterns such as stripes and checks or rows of stepped lines. Many of her items are large <b>simply-designed</b> pieces, frequently unglazed, with geometrical decorations {{where a few}} brush-strokes emphasize the form. In this way, her stoneware achieved a unique level of strength and sensitivity in Danish ceramics.|$|E

For a period it belonged to the Crown until it came {{into the hands of}} the Urne family in the 16th and 17th centuries and the Wichfelds thereafter. The two-storey Neoclassical building was built in 1807 and expanded in 1889. The facade of the <b>simply-designed</b> residence is adorned with four iconic pilasters and a triangular pediment.|$|E

The launch took place from <b>simply-designed</b> racks that could hold 35 rockets (5 × 7) and from which several rockets were fired simultaneously. Also {{launches}} of individual rockets were possible. The range was 1200 m. Aiming was achieved by direct sight through a semi-circular visor.|$|E

40|$|A handy, <b>simply-designed</b> {{press was}} built using a geared motor and a jack. The maximum force is about 1 ton. The piston can be driven at {{a wide range}} of speeds, from 70 to 0. 07 mm/min, which are {{selected}} by a rotary switch on the operation panel. Based on our own experiences, we report difficulties to be expected, mistakes to avoid, and important factors to be considered in designing and building a press, with a view to give helpful advice to beginners. ＜論説...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} capabilities of fuzzy and genetic fuzzy system approaches in urban trip distribution modelling {{with some new}} features. First, a simple fuzzy rule-based system (FRBS) and a novel genetic fuzzy rule-based system [GFRBS: a fuzzy system improved by a knowledge base learning process with genetic algorithms (GAs) ] are designed to model intra-city passenger flows for Istanbul. Subsequently, their accuracy, applicability and generalizability characteristics are evaluated against the well-known gravity- and neural network (NN) -based trip distribution models. The overall results show that: traditional doubly constrained gravity models are still simple and efficient; NNs may not show expected performance when {{they are forced to}} satisfy trip constraints; <b>simply-designed</b> FRBSs, learning from observations and expertise, are both efficient and interpretable even if the data are large and noisy; and use of GAs in fuzzy rule-based learning considerably increases modelling performance, although it brings additional computation cost.

40|$|Thesis (Doctoral) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, City and Regional Planning, İzmir, 2010 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 89 - 96) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishix, 141 leavesTrip distribution modelling {{is one of}} {{the most}} active parts of travel demand analysis. In recent years, use of soft computing techniques has introduced effective modelling approaches to the trip distribution problem. Fuzzy Rule-Based System (FRBS) and Genetic Fuzzy Rule-Based System (GFRBS: fuzzy system improved by a knowledge base learning process with genetic algorithms) modelling of trip distribution are two of these new approaches. However, much of the potential of these techniques has not been demonstrated so far. The present study explores the potential capabilities of these approaches in an urban trip distribution problem with some new features. For this purpose, a simple FRBS and a novel GFRBS were designed to model Istanbul intra-city passenger flows. Subsequently, their accuracy, applicability, and generalizability characteristics were evaluated against the well-known gravity and neural networks based trip distribution models. The overall results show that: i) traditional doubly constrained gravity models are still simple and efficient; ii) neural networks may not show expected performance when they are forced to satisfy production-attraction constraints; iii) <b>simply-designed</b> FRBSs, learning from observations and expertise, are both interpretable and efficient in forecasting trip interchanges even if the data is large and noisy; and iv) use of genetic algorithms in fuzzy rule base learning considerably increases modelling performance, although it brings additional computation costs...|$|E

Design: Pre- and post-trial. Setting: University hospital from January 2009 to May 2010. Participants: Elderly with falls in the previous year. Intervention: Simple balancing exercise was performed at home every day and was recorded in the booklet. Measurements: New falling events and a battery of balancing abilities including the Timed Up and Go Test (TUGT), chair stand, functional reach, and Berg balance scale-short form were evaluated at baseline, 3 -, 6 -, 9 -, and 12 -month periods. Fear of falling {{and quality of life}} scores were assessed at baseline and 12 -month periods. Results: 146 subjects were recruited, 116 female (79. 5 %) {{with a mean age of}} 67. 1 years. At the end of the study, 49 % of participants had not fallen. All of the balancing abilities were compared between frequent and infrequent fallers and were significantly improved (P&nbsp;&lt; 0. 001) except for functional reach in the frequent fall group. Most subjects (72 %&ndash; 79 %) complied well with the exercise program. However, compliance had no effect on balancing abilities. About 36. 4 % of participants had adverse events from exercise, of which knee pain was the top ranked. The quality of life and the fall efficacy scores increased significantly at the end of the study. Factors affecting falling were compliance with exercise (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 2. 55, 95 % confidence intervals [CI]: 1. 04, 6. 30) and a history of falling &ge; 3 times in the previous year (adjusted OR: 3. 76, 95 % CI: 1. 18, 11. 98). Conclusion: Performing <b>simply-designed</b> balancing exercises, at least 3 days per week, can increase balancing abilities, and decrease fall rates in the elderly with a history of previous falls. However, strategies to encourage elderly compliance may prevent falling. Keywords: balancing training, exercise, fall prevention, frequent fall, elderl...|$|E
