500|$|The front (west side) of {{the garage}} is made of the same mosaic gray brick that {{was used for the}} {{construction}} of the church and the rectory. [...] The north and south walls are both made of two different materials: the western two-thirds of them is red brick, possibly from the brickyard that once operated in Madison; the easternmost third is plastered with a layer of cement, painted red to match the bricks. [...] The rear (east) wall is also plastered with red cement. [...] It is speculated that the garage was either lengthened to fit a longer car, or that the eastern third had to be rebuilt; the building's hip roof <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> having been lengthened.|$|E
500|$|At the 1944 CCF convention, Lewis won a {{concession}} [...] "that even large business {{could have a}} place in the party – if they behave." [...] Rather than opposing all private enterprise, Lewis was concerned with preventing monopoly capitalism. [...] He passed a resolution reading [...] "The socialization of large-scale enterprise, however, does not mean taking over every private business. [...] Where private business <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> becoming a monopoly, operates efficiently under decent working conditions, and does not operate {{to the detriment of the}} Canadian people, it will be given every opportunity to function, to provide a fair rate of return and to make its contribution to the nation's wealth." [...] This resolution allowed for a mixed-economy that left most jobs in the private sphere.|$|E
500|$|Zara Golden of VH1 {{regarding}} the video commented that, although Usher {{had a lot}} of troubles in his life [...] "he gives the kid a hug, enjoys a dance at the strip club (why not?) and sings out all the rest in a recording booth." [...] Billboards David Greenwald praised the choreography and noted that Usher <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> sickness as he performs the compound choreography, [...] "which ends with a forceful escape". Sam Lansky of Idolator was divided on the video and wrote that the singer [...] "could have dug a little deeper to tap into some of that very real personal pain to bring something more emotionally charged to this video; as it stands, it’s a little too polished to feel anything but contrived." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{several places}} Leland {{provides}} the Italian he was translating. According to Mario Pazzaglini, {{author of the}} 1999 translation, the Italian contains misspellings, missing words, and grammatical errors, and is in a standardised Italian rather than the local dialect one might expect. Pazzaglini concludes that Aradia represents material translated from dialect to basic Italian and then into English, creating a summary of texts, {{some of which were}} mis-recorded. Leland himself called the text a [...] "collection of ceremonies, 'cantrips,' incantations, and traditions" [...] and described it as an attempt to gather material, [...] "valuable and curious remains of ancient Latin or Etruscan lore" [...] that he feared would be lost. There is no cohesive narrative even in the sections that Leland attributes to the Vangelo. This lack of cohesion, or [...] "inconsistency", is an argument for the text's authenticity, according to religious scholar Chas S. Clifton, since the text <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> being [...] "massaged ... for future book buyers." ...|$|E
500|$|Carol Buckland of CNN {{considered}} that [...] "Evita {{is basically a}} music video with epic pretensions. This {{is not to say}} it isn't gorgeous to look at or occasionally extremely entertaining. It's both of those things. But for all the movie's grand style, it falls short in terms of substance and soul." [...] Newsweeks David Ansen wrote, [...] "It's gorgeous. It's epic. It's spectacular. But two hours later, it also proves to be emotionally impenetrable." [...] Giving the film a C- rating, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly criticized Parker's direction, stating, [...] "Evita could have worked had it been staged as larger-than-life spectacle... The way Alan Parker has directed Evita, however, it's just a sluggish, contradictory mess, a drably [...] "realistic" [...] Latin-revolution music video driven by a soundtrack of mediocre '70s rock." [...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times praised Madonna's performance as well as the costume design and cinematography, but wrote that the film was [...] "breathless and shrill, since Alan Parker's direction <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> a moral or political compass and remains in exhausting overdrive all the time." [...] Jane Horwitz of the Sun-Sentinel stated, [...] "Madonna sings convincingly and gets through the acting, but her performance lacks depth, grace and muscle. Luckily, director Alan Parker's historic-looking production with its epic crowd scenes and sepia-toned newsreels shows her off well." ...|$|E
500|$|Most {{fossils of}} Wiwaxia {{are just a}} jumble of armor plates and spines, but after {{examining}} dozens of them Conway Morris reconstructed them as slug-like animals covered in rows of overlapping armor plates, with two rows of longer spines projecting upwards. Since 1990 {{there has been an}} intense debate about whether Wiwaxia was more closely related to molluscs or to polychaete annelids. Supporters of a close relationship with molluscs maintained that a pair of bars, running across the mouth and armed with backward-pointing teeth, were a rudimentary form of the radula, the toothed tongue that molluscs use to scrape up food and convey it back to the throat. Nicholas Butterfield, the one academic who has so far published articles placing Wiwaxia closer to polychaetes, stated that Wiwaxia′s two-row feeding apparatus could not have performed the sophisticated functions of the multi-row, conveyor-belt radula, suggesting instead that Wiwaxia′s apparatus was like the side-by-side pair of toothed bars found in some polychaetes. Later he found some fragmentary fossils, 5 to 10million years before the Burgess Shale, that he regarded as a much more convincing early radula. Butterfield has also described Wiwaxia′s armor plates and spines as similar in internal structure to the chetae ("hairs") of polychaetes. Supporters of the link with molluscs have stated that Wiwaxia <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> segmentation, appendages in front of the mouth, or [...] "legs—–all of which are typical polychaete features. One writer adopted a neutral position, saying he saw no strong grounds for classifying Wiwaxia as a proto-annelid or a proto-mollusc, although he thought the objections against classification as a proto-annelid were the stronger.|$|E

500|$|On Stranger Tides {{also had}} {{positive}} reviews; some critics found {{the film to}} be entertaining and well-made. Richard Roeper gave the film a B+, describing it as [...] "the most fun installment since the first", calling the story [...] "pure cartoon, but {{a lot easier to}} follow than the other sequels", and summing as [...] "the franchise is getting tired, but Penelope energizes it." [...] Along the same lines, Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film three out of four stars, writing that it [...] "feels as fresh and bracingly exhilarating as the day Jack Sparrow first swashed his buckle, infusing new reckless energy into a franchise that <b>shows</b> <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> furling its sails". She said that Marshall [...] "swiftly and without fuss delivers the action set pieces and eye-popping escapism" [...] and praised Depp, Cruz, and McShane's performances. Ray Bennett from The Hollywood Reporter considered that Marshall [...] "shows terrific flair with all the usual chases and sword fights, and he handles the 3D well", and welcomed Penélope Cruz's character, saying she [...] "brings her Oscar-winning vivacity" [...] and had [...] "lively sexual tension" [...] with Depp. Writing for The Globe and Mail, Rick Groen found the action scenes to range from [...] "merely competent to tritely cluttered", but he was pleased with the overall result, calling McShane a [...] "fresh villain" [...] whose [...] "stentorian tones are welcome anywhere". Variety's Andrew Barker considered the film derivative, but accessible. [...] "It has nary an original idea and still doesn't make much sense, but it's lost all pretensions that it should". He praised Geoffrey Rush, stating that he [...] "not only gets the funniest lines and reaction shots, but also starts to siphon away much of the roguish charm that used to be Depp's stock and trade." ...|$|E
