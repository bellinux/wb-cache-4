5|$|Adams' 1996 sequel, Tales from Watership Down {{includes}} stories {{where the}} female rabbits {{play a more}} prominent role in the Watership Down warren. It has been <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{might have been an}} attempt to modernise the story, to make it more in tune with the political sensibilities of the 1990s, when it was published.|$|E
5|$|He {{could not}} breathe {{for the first}} twenty minutes of his life. It is <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{deprivation}} may have caused him to develop Asperger's syndrome—some of his biographers, such as Mitchell Snay, maintain that this condition would account for his eccentric behaviors in later life. He was of English descent, and his forebears included early settlers of Massachusetts and New Hampshire.|$|E
5|$|Molecular phylogenetics {{have shown}} that C.cirrhata forms a {{monophyletic}} clade with the remaining two species of Collybia. Because C.cirrhata {{is the only one}} of the three Collybia species lacking sclerotia, it has been <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> character trait is an anapomorphy—that is, unique to a single, terminal species within a clade.|$|E

5|$|One {{proposal}} considered was {{to merge}} JAL with ANA, which {{would create a}} single larger international airline and replace Japan Airlines International; however, media reports <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> proposal would be opposed by ANA given its comparatively better financial performance as an independent carrier. The task force also examined possible partnerships with foreign carriers.|$|E
5|$|One {{theory about}} the origin of the Debian logo is that Buzz Lightyear, the chosen {{character}} for the first named Debian release, has a swirl in his chin. Stefano Zacchiroli also <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> swirl is the Debian one.|$|E
5|$|Opposition MPs {{complained that}} several {{recommendations}} for access-to-information reform were {{omitted from the}} bill, and were instead sent to committee for further review. New Democratic Party MP Pat Martin <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> deferral could delay meaningful reform for the foreseeable future. Martin later {{made a deal with}} Baird to give the bill an easy passage through committee, in return for the Conservatives accepting some NDP amendments.|$|E

5|$|Some eye defects may {{naturally}} {{change for}} the better with age or in cycles (ophthalmologist Stewart Duke-Elder <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is what happened with Aldous Huxley). A cataract when first setting in sometimes results in much improved eyesight for a short time. One who happens to have been practicing the Bates method will likely credit it for any improvement experienced regardless of the actual cause.|$|E
5|$|The {{so-called}} Fourth Military Gate {{stands between}} towers 59 and 60, {{and is currently}} walled up. Recently, it has been <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> gate is actually the Gate of St. Romanus, but the evidence is uncertain.|$|E
5|$|A local report <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{bridge was}} used by George Washington {{and two of his}} aides while still under {{construction}} and the timbers had yet to be secured, with Bull helping their horses across. The bridge also served as a point of refuge, particularly for Connecticut's Blue Law offenders, where once on the left bank of the river, they could easily cross to the New York border. State authorities would not go through the extradition process, leaving them safe.|$|E

5|$|A major talking {{point at}} the conference was the {{discovery}} by Willis Lamb and his graduate student Robert Retherford shortly before the conference began {{that one of the}} two possible quantum states of hydrogen atoms had slightly more energy than predicted by the Paul Dirac's theory; this became known as the Lamb shift. Oppenheimer and Weisskopf <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was a result of quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. Pre-war quantum electrodynamics (QED) gave absurd, infinite values for this; but the Lamb shift showed that it was both real and finite. Hans Kramers proposed renormalization as a solution, but no one knew how to do the calculation.|$|E
5|$|A {{spontaneous}} CSF leak is idiopathic, {{meaning the}} cause in unknown. Various scientists and physicians have <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> condition {{may be the}} result of an underlying connective tissue disorder affecting the spinal dura. It may also run in families and be associated with aortic aneurysms and joint hypermobility. Up to two thirds of those afflicted demonstrate some type of generalized connective tissue disorder. Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease are the three most common connective tissue disorders associated with SCSFLS.|$|E
5|$|A woman's {{fertility}} is {{also affected}} by her age. As a woman's total egg supply is formed in fetal life, to be ovulated decades later, {{it has been}} <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> long lifetime may make the chromatin of eggs more vulnerable to division problems, breakage, and mutation than the chromatin of sperm, which are produced continuously during a man's reproductive life. However, despite this hypothesis, a similar paternal age effect has also been observed.|$|E

5|$|After making further radial {{velocity}} measurements, a planet orbiting {{at a distance}} of around 5 AU was announced in 2002. This planet received the designation 55 Cancri d. At the time of discovery, the planet was thought to be in an orbit of mild eccentricity (close to 0.1), but this value was increased by later measurements. Even after accounting for these two planets, a periodicity at 43 days remained, possibly due to a third planet. Measurements of the star <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was close to the star's rotation period, which raised the possibility that the 43-day signal was caused by stellar activity. This possible planet received the designation 55 Cancri c.|$|E
5|$|Although Innis remains {{appreciated}} {{and respected}} {{for the grand}} and unique nature of his later efforts regarding communications theories, he was not without critics. Particularly, the fragmentary and mosaic writing style exemplified in Empire and Communications has been criticized as ambiguous, aggressively non-linear, and lacking connections between levels of analysis. Biographers have <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> style {{may have been a}} result of Innis' illness late in his career.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{childhood}} {{influence was}} Heigo Kurosawa, Akira's older brother by four years. In {{the aftermath of}} the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923, which devastated Tokyo, Heigo took the 13-year-old Akira to view the devastation. When the younger brother wanted to look away from the human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere, Heigo forbade him to do so, instead encouraging Akira to face his fears by confronting them directly. Some commentators have <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> incident would influence Kurosawa's later artistic career, as the director was seldom hesitant to confront unpleasant truths in his work.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{excavation}} {{also revealed}} evidence for modern activity around the site. Three post-medieval pits {{were identified in}} and around the barrow, as well as a post-medieval attempt to dig into the chamber. Finds from this period included ceramic sherds, clay pipes dated from between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, stone and clay marbles, brick tile, and bottles dated from between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries. Alexander <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> evidence confirmed local accounts that it had been used as a popular spot for picnics. There are also accounts that it came {{to be used as a}} well-known rabbit warren in the local area.|$|E
5|$|Based {{upon the}} {{structure}} of the bill, it has been <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> unique bill was used as a pincer, with the tips of both mandibles touching. The hookbill could have used this movement to pluck fruits or flowers for consumption, or it may have been used to extract snails from their shells. It is also possible that the bird could have crushed a snail shell between its mandibles and then used its tongue to ingest the meat and expel the shell out of the open sides of the beak.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{bonds between}} atoms were now explained, by Gilbert Newton Lewis in 1916, as the {{interactions}} between their constituent electrons. As the chemical properties of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law, in 1919 the American chemist Irving Langmuir <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> could be explained if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of electron shells about the nucleus.|$|E
