5|$|On {{the day of}} the concert, trains {{ran into}} Sarajevo {{for the first time since}} the start of the war. Two lines were opened, one from Mostar to Sarajevo and the other from Maglaj to Sarajevo. Although the {{railways}} had been functional for the duration of the war, Muslim and Croat politicians could not decide who would operate them. As a result, the trains were only run on the date of the concert to bring fans to the city, and the day after to take them home again. Visa requirements were temporarily suspended. An effort was made to include all of the country's ethnic groups at the concert. Approximately 500fans crossed the ethnic boundary lines between Bosnia's Serb Republic and the Moslem-Croat Federation. People from several of the other Yugoslavian republics went to Sarajevo for the concert, with buses carrying fans from Zagreb, Croatia and Ljubljana, Slovenia. Security around the event was strict.

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2010, {{relations}} soured between the French contingent and residents in several villages that led to injuries on both sides, after a French regiment began an exercise {{in order to identify}} Hezbollah members that included searching homes, taking photographs, using <b>sniffer</b> <b>dogs,</b> and questioning residents. Residents accused them of violating private property, treating them with contempt, and of not coordinating with the Lebanese army. The residents made clear that their conflict was only with the French contingent, and that relations with other contingents were good. Following discussions between UNIFIL commanders, ambassadors of countries with soldiers in UNIFIL, and the commander of the Lebanese army, an agreement was reached under which <b>sniffer</b> <b>dogs</b> would no longer be used, UNIFIL soldiers would refrain from entering Lebanese homes and yards, and only Lebanese army soldiers would carry out searches of homes.|$|E

50|$|Teenagers {{expect the}} {{contents}} of their backpacks not {{to be open to}} the random and speculative scrutiny of the police. This expectation is a reasonable one that society should support. The guilty secret of {{the contents of}} the accused’s backpack was specific and meaningful information, intended to be private, and concealed in an enclosed space in which the accused had a continuing expectation of privacy.Although a warrantless <b>sniffer</b> <b>dog</b> search is available where reasonable suspicion is demonstrated, the <b>sniffer</b> <b>dog</b> search of the students’ belongings in this case violated their Charter rights under s. 8. The dog sniff search was unreasonably undertaken because there was no proper justification. The youth court judge found that the police lacked any grounds for reasonable suspicion and excluded the evidence. The Court agreed that his exclusion of the evidence should not be interfered with.|$|R

The chances of finding more living survivors following this were reportedly very slim.|$|E
