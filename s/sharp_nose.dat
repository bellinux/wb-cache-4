This is the criminal type that may be discovered as soon as observed. It sullies the name of Italian.|$|E

When this relentless fellow, having reached his sixth Test hundred against England, at length took a liberty he had made 592 runs in the Tests, average 84, the highest aggregate since Bradman's in 1946/7: not only that, he had scored 979 against Smith's side since they landed in Perth, and had occupied the crease for forty-one and a half hours. There was a gayer side to Lawry as we had seen at Adelaide – but he didn't let it obtrude too often.

40|$|Values of total-drag {{coefficient}} {{were measured}} for two fin-stabilized, blunt-nose bodies of revolution in free flight at Mach numbers from 0. 8 to 1. 5. The blunt-nose configurationswere designed by rounding off the <b>sharp</b> <b>noses</b> of two previously tested configurations,having nose fineness ratios of about ~, to radii equal to about ~ 4 the maximum body radii. By comparing the measured values of drag coefficient based on frontal {{area for the}} blunt- and pointed-nose models, it is found that, within the accuracy and range of the present tests, rounding off the <b>sharp</b> <b>noses</b> produced no ticrease in the total drag of either configuration...|$|R

60|$|A {{school of}} feeding {{bonefish}} came toward us. I counted eleven tails {{out of the}} water. They were around my bait. Now or never, I thought, waiting frantically!

The instant that <b>sharp</b> <b>nose</b> dropped out of sight, Peter made ready to run for his life. A second later, Reddy leaped over the wall, and Peter was off as hard as he could go, with Reddy almost at his heels.

To satisfy high form accuracy and surface roughness, ultra-precision cylindrical turning (UPCT) is a feasible fabrication process. In previous research, it was indicated that the tool with <b>sharper</b> <b>nose</b> radius could make UPCT more stable and reduce subsurface damage.

50|$|The {{provisional}} 330 America {{was replaced}} in January 1964 {{by the new}} 330 GT 2+2. It was first shown at the Brussels Show, early that year. It {{was much more than}} a re-engined 250, however, with a <b>sharper</b> <b>nose</b> and tail, quad headlights, and a wide grille. The wheelbase was 50 mm longer, but Koni adjustable shock absorbers improved handling. A dual-circuit Dunlop braking system was used with discs all around, though it separated brakes front to back rather than diagonally as on modern systems. When leaving the factory the 330 GT originally fitted Pirelli Cinturato 205VR15 tyres (CN72).|$|R

2500|$|The Maserati MC12 has {{the same}} engine, chassis and gearbox as the Enzo but the only {{externally}} visible component from the Enzo is the windshield. [...] Due to this the Maserati MC12 is sometimes nicknamed the [...] "Second Generation Ferrari Enzo". The MC12 is slower accelerating (0–100km/h or 0–62mph in 3.8 s), has a lower top speed of 330km/h (205mph) and less drag coefficient (due to <b>sharper</b> <b>nose</b> and smoother curves) than the Enzo due to engine tuning. [...] However, the MC12 has lapped race tracks faster than the Enzo before, specifically on the UK motoring show Top Gear, and the Nurburgring Nordschleife (at colder outside temperature). [...] However this {{could be attributed to}} the MC12's Pirelli PZero Corsa tires which have more grip than the Enzo's Bridgestone Scuderias.|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} of the drag tests of six bodies of revolution with systematically varying shapes {{and with a}} fineness ratio of 5.

A. variable-density tunnel over a range of values of Reynolds number from about 1, 500, 000 to 25, 000, 000. The results show that the bodies with the <b>sharper</b> <b>noses</b> and tails have the lowest drag coefficients, even when the drag coefficients are based on the two-thirds power of the volume. The data shows the most important single characteristic of the body form to be the tail angle, which must be fine to obtain low drag...|$|R
