25|$|A {{wireless}} {{local area}} network is the linking of two or more computers or devices using <b>spread-spectrum</b> or OFDM modulation technology based to enable communication between devices in a limited area. In 1970, the University of Hawaii, under the leadership of Norman Abramson, invented the world's first computer communication network using low-cost ham-like radios, named ALOHAnet. The bidirectional star topology of the system included seven computers deployed over four islands to communicate with the central computer on the Oahu Island without using phone lines.|$|E
2500|$|... {{receiver}} or {{interfere with}} other transmissions, the data bit sequence {{is combined with}} the output of a linear-feedback register before modulation and transmission. This scrambling is removed at the receiver after demodulation. When the LFSR runs at the same bit rate as the transmitted symbol stream, this technique {{is referred to as}} scrambling. When the LFSR runs considerably faster than the symbol stream, the LFSR-generated bit sequence is called chipping code. The chipping code is combined with the data using exclusive or before transmitting using binary phase-shift keying or a similar modulation method. The resulting signal has a higher bandwidth than the data, and therefore this is a method of <b>spread-spectrum</b> communication. When used only for the <b>spread-spectrum</b> property, this technique is called direct-sequence spread spectrum; when used to distinguish several signals transmitted in the same channel {{at the same time and}} frequency, it is called code division multiple access.|$|E
2500|$|The 802.11a amateur {{radio band}} {{consists}} of twelve non-overlapping channels in the 5.650–5.925GHz (5cm) band. The 802.11a standard uses OFDM or [...] "Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing" [...] to transmit data and therefore is not classified as <b>spread-spectrum.</b> Because of this 802.11a hardware {{is not subject}} to the power rules in FCC [...] and the maximum allowable output power is 1500 watts (W) PEP.|$|E
2500|$|If , the {{modulation}} {{is called}} wideband FM and its bandwidth is approximately [...] While wideband FM uses more bandwidth, it {{can improve the}} signal-to-noise ratio significantly; for example, doubling the value of , while keeping [...] constant, results in an eight-fold improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio. (Compare this with Chirp spread spectrum, which uses extremely wide frequency deviations to achieve processing gains comparable to traditional, better-known <b>spread-spectrum</b> modes).|$|E
2500|$|Tomographic {{transmissions}} {{consist of}} long coded signals (e.g., [...] "m-sequences") lasting 30 seconds or more. [...] The frequencies employed range from [...] 50 to 1000Hz and source powers range from 100 to 250 W, {{depending on the}} particular goals of the measurements. [...] With precise timing such as from GPS, travel times can be measured to a nominal accuracy of 1 millisecond. [...] While these transmissions are audible near the source, beyond a range of several kilometers the signals are usually below ambient noise levels, requiring sophisticated <b>spread-spectrum</b> signal processing techniques to recover them.|$|E
2500|$|All {{electronic}} systems emit some unwanted radio frequency energy. [...] Various regulatory agencies (such as the FCC in the United States) put {{limits on the}} emitted energy and any interference caused by it. [...] The emitted noise generally appears at sharp spectral peaks (usually at the operating frequency of the device, and a few harmonics). [...] A system designer can use a <b>spread-spectrum</b> PLL to reduce interference with high-Q receivers by spreading the energy over a larger portion of the spectrum. [...] For example, by changing the operating frequency up and down by a small amount (about 1%), a device running at hundreds of megahertz can spread its interference evenly over a few megahertz of spectrum, which drastically reduces the amount of noise seen on broadcast FM radio channels, which have a bandwidth of several tens of kilohertz.|$|E
50|$|FCC {{certification}} testing is often completed with the <b>spread-spectrum</b> function enabled {{in order to}} reduce the measured emissions to within acceptable legal limits. However, the <b>spread-spectrum</b> functionality may be disabled by the user in some cases. As an example, in the area of personal computers, some BIOS writers include the ability to disable <b>spread-spectrum</b> clock generation as a user setting, thereby defeating the object of the EMI regulations. This might be considered a loophole, but is generally overlooked as long as <b>spread-spectrum</b> is enabled by default.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Spread-spectrum</b> {{transmissions}} {{can share}} a frequency band with {{many types of}} conventional transmissions with minimal interference.

5000|$|CDMA is a <b>spread-spectrum</b> multiple-access {{technique}}. A <b>spread-spectrum</b> technique spreads the bandwidth of {{the data}} uniformly for the same transmitted power. A spreading code is a pseudo-random code that has a narrow ambiguity function, unlike other narrow pulse codes. In CDMA a locally generated code runs {{at a much higher}} rate than the data to be transmitted. Data for transmission is combined by bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) with the faster code. The figure shows how a <b>spread-spectrum</b> signal is generated. The data signal with pulse duration of [...] (symbol period) is XORed with the code signal with pulse duration of [...] (chip period). (Note: bandwidth is proportional to , where [...] = bit time.) Therefore, the bandwidth {{of the data}} signal is [...] and the bandwidth of the spread spectrum signal is [...] Since [...] is much smaller than , the bandwidth of the <b>spread-spectrum</b> signal is much larger than the bandwidth of the original signal. The ratio [...] is called the spreading factor or processing gain and determines to a certain extent the upper limit {{of the total number of}} users supported simultaneously by a base station.|$|E
50|$|However, <b>spread-spectrum</b> clocking, {{like other}} kinds of dynamic {{frequency}} change, can also create challenges for designers. Principal among these is clock/data misalignment, or clock skew.|$|E
50|$|An {{ability to}} disable <b>spread-spectrum</b> {{clocking}} in computer systems is considered useful for overclocking, as spread spectrum can lower maximum clock speed achievable due to clock skew.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Spread-spectrum</b> {{signals are}} highly {{resistant}} to narrowband interference. The process of re-collecting a spread signal spreads out the interfering signal, {{causing it to}} recede into the background.|$|E
50|$|While binary LFSRs {{require less}} power to {{generate}} <b>spread-spectrum</b> signals than AFSRs, AFSR receivers require less power (in theory) to synchronize to those signals than binary LFSR receivers.|$|E
5000|$|Resistance to eavesdropping. The {{spreading}} code (in DS systems) or the frequency-hopping pattern (in FH systems) is often unknown by anyone {{for whom the}} signal is unintended, in which case it obscures the signal and reduces the chance of an adversary's making sense of it. Moreover, for a given noise power spectral density (PSD), <b>spread-spectrum</b> systems require {{the same amount of}} energy per bit before spreading as narrowband systems and therefore the same amount of power if the bitrate before spreading is the same, but since the signal power is spread over a large bandwidth, the signal PSD is much lower [...] - [...] often significantly lower than the noise PSD [...] - [...] so that the adversary may be unable to determine whether the signal exists at all. However, for mission-critical applications, particularly those employing commercially available radios, <b>spread-spectrum</b> radios do not intrinsically provide adequate security; [...] "...just using <b>spread-spectrum</b> radio itself is not sufficient for communications security".|$|E
50|$|As of 2005, AFSRs {{are still}} in research.AFSR {{techniques}} could make <b>spread-spectrum</b> receivers (such as GPS receivers and cell phones and WiFi receivers and RFIDs) cost less and have longer battery lifetimes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spread-spectrum</b> {{clocking}} avoids {{this problem}} by {{using one of the}} methods previously described to reduce the peak radiated energy and, therefore, its electromagnetic emissions and so comply with electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) regulations.|$|E
50|$|CDMA {{can also}} {{effectively}} reject narrow-band interference. Since narrow-band interference affects {{only a small}} portion of the <b>spread-spectrum</b> signal, it can easily be removed through notch filtering without much loss of information. Convolution encoding and interleaving can be used to assist in recovering this lost data. CDMA signals are also resistant to multipath fading. Since the <b>spread-spectrum</b> signal occupies a large bandwidth, {{only a small portion}} of this will undergo fading due to multipath at any given time. Like the narrow-band interference, this will result in only a small loss of data and can be overcome.|$|E
5000|$|In a <b>spread-spectrum</b> system, {{the process}} gain (or [...] "processing gain") is {{the ratio of}} the spread (or RF) {{bandwidth}} to the unspread (or baseband) bandwidth. It is usually expressed in decibels (dB).|$|E
