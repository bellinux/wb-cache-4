40|$|This thesis explores and {{documents}} {{the profession of}} land surveying in Dublin, Ireland, during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries until 1810. It aims to present the many aspects of land surveying in Dublin during this period. As such, it {{is the history of}} a skilled, varied and complex craft practiced by both professionals and amateurs. It establishes a definition for the career title land surveyor, examines the viability of the profession in eighteenth-century Dublin and how the elements of <b>surveying</b> <b>science,</b> art, technology and business integrated together to create a feasible career. The science and technology of surveying, established primarily from period treatises and manuals, is evaluated, compared and investigated with specific focus on surveying instrumentation and associated methodology. The practical application of surveying technology and techniques is examined through a series of case studies to demonstrate both the diversity of period surveying work and the individuals who practiced it. The cartographic output from such projects, the various artistic styles, strengths, weaknesses and trends additionally reflect this diversity...|$|E

[...] XMM-Newton <b>Survey</b> <b>Science</b> CentreWe present {{preliminary}} results on the XMM-Newton <b>Survey</b> <b>Science</b> Centre medium sensitivity survey (XMS), with 0. 5 - 4. 5 keV flux limit 2 x 10 ^- 14 erg/cm 2 /s. At present, 19 fields have been examined with a total of 239 X-ray sources. Identifications for about 2 / 3 of these reveal that type 1 AGN dominate, but type 2 AGN, absorption-line galaxies and clusters as well as stars are also present. We also discuss on a few X-ray selected Broad-Absorption-Line QSOs found in this survey. Based partly on observations obtained with XMM-Newton, an ESA science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA member states and the USA (NASA).

40|$|Large radio surveys such {{as those}} {{proposed}} for several SKA pathfinder and precursor telescopes require (automated) source-finding algorithms that are highly reliable, complete, and fast. Similarly, sophisticated visualisation tools are needed to explore the resulting survey data together with their multi-wavelength counterparts. In this PASA Special Issue on Source Finding and Visualisation, several advanced source-finding algorithms, including novel methods for radio continuum, polarisation and spectral line surveys are described, tested and compared. The process of finding sources can be considered one of many important steps (e. g., preprocessing, source finding and characterisation, cataloguing/post-processing) {{in the production of}} astronomical source catalogues, on which much of the <b>survey</b> <b>science</b> is based. The Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP), equipped with novel Chequerboard phased array feeds, will be a powerful 21 -cm survey machine. For the large volumes of ASKAP data, a special version of DUCHAMP, called SELAVY, is being developed in consultation with the ASKAP <b>survey</b> <b>science</b> teams (Whiting & Humphreys 2012).
