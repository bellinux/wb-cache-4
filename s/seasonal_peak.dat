50|$|Since the mid-1970s, the {{beech marten}} {{has been known}} to {{occasionally}} cause damage to cars. Cars attacked by martens typically have cut tubes and cables. A beech marten can slice through the cables of a starter motor with just one bite. The reason for this is not fully known, as the damaged items are not eaten. There is, however, a <b>seasonal</b> <b>peak</b> in marten attacks on cars in spring, when young martens explore their surroundings more often and have yet to learn which items in their habitat are edible or not. The fishoil, often contained in the cables of cars of Japanese origin, may contribute to this.|$|E
50|$|The Profile House was a grand {{hotel in}} the White Mountains of New Hampshire, in the United States. Originally built in 1852 and opening for its first season in 1853, it was {{operated}} by several owners and partners until its final season under the ownership of Karl P. Abbott, when the hotel, at its <b>seasonal</b> <b>peak,</b> burned to the ground, leaving only the train depot standing in the fire's aftermath. Area attractions included Franconia Notch, the Great Boulder flume (Flume Gorge), Artist's Bluff, Mount Cannon, Profile Lake, Echo Lake, and Eagle Cliff. The Profile House boasted amenities such as running water, electricity {{and all of the}} comforts to which the affluent guests had become accustomed.

40|$|AbstractEscherichia coli is {{a common}} cause of infections in all populations and {{countries}} of the world, causing an enormous burden of disease. In this issue of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, Al-Hasan et al. describe <b>seasonal</b> <b>peaks</b> {{in the incidence of}} E. coli bloodstream infection (BSI) during the summer for a population of 125 000 in Minnesota, USA. We discuss the probability that similar <b>seasonal</b> <b>peaks</b> in the incidence of E. coli BSI occur in other populations and geographical regions. Second, we discuss possible underlying explanations for these findings in terms of seasonal changes in human behaviour and the effect of temperature on the ability of E. coli to survive in the environment. Finally, we discuss some of the possible implications of E. coli BSI being a seasonal illness. More specifically, we discuss how better understanding the reasons for seasonality may potentially help us to better understand the dominant routes by which human populations are exposed to clonal groups of E. coli associated with urinary tract infection...|$|R

5000|$|The {{crisis in}} money markets was {{imminent}} since spring, when Central Bank of Russia warned {{the public of}} a gradual contraction in bank lending due to unfolding world liquidity crisis. However, the regulator preferred to combat inflation, raising the refinancing rate and bank reserve contributions. 1 September hike in reserve rate alone withdrew nearly 100 billion roubles from the money market. The raise coincided with a <b>seasonal</b> <b>peak</b> in tax payments and left the banking system in a worse state of liquidity than that of August 1998. A subsequent drop in rouble-to-dollar exchange rate and dollar-denominated prices of Russian corporate securities forced investors to crowd out, worsening the positive feedback loop. The interbank money market that traditionally relied on Russian corporate stock as a collateral for the repurchase agreements, immediately imploded in what was called [...] "a crisis of trust" [...] or even [...] "elimination of trust": when the borrowers defaulted on loans, leaving lenders with impaired collateral, other banks stopped lending as a precaution.|$|E
50|$|The first {{recognized}} dengue epidemics occurred almost {{simultaneously in}} Asia, Africa, and North America in the 1780s, {{shortly after the}} identification and naming of the disease in 1779. A pandemic began in Southeast Asia in the 1950s, and by 1975 DHF had become {{a leading cause of}} death among children in the region. The first case of DHF was reported in Manila, Philippines around 1953 through 1954. A small child with dengue fever started to bleed uncontrollably. Other children then became victims to the new symptom. Epidemic dengue has become more common since the 1980s. By the late 1990s, dengue was the most important mosquito-borne disease affecting humans after malaria, with around 40 million cases of dengue fever and several hundred thousand cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever each year.Significant outbreaks of dengue fever tend to occur every five or six months. The cyclical rise and fall in numbers of dengue cases is thought {{to be the result of}} seasonal cycles interacting with a short-lived cross-immunity for all four strains in people who have had dengue. When the cross-immunity wears off the population is more susceptible to transmission whenever the next <b>seasonal</b> <b>peak</b> occurs. Thus over time there remain large numbers of susceptible people in affected populations despite previous outbreaks due to the four different serotypes of dengue virus and the presence of unexposed individuals from childbirth or immigration.|$|E
50|$|Until the {{creation}} of the M&GN, the Great Eastern Railway (GER) held a near-monopoly on East Anglian traffic and had assumed that their network meant there were no population centres left to connect. However, the GER lines were mostly north to south, centred on London, leaving an opening for the smaller companies that later became the M&GN to thread their way east to west between the GER lines, and in this way connected the major towns of Norfolk (Great Yarmouth, Norwich, King's Lynn) and many other smaller centres via the MR and GNR networks to the Midlands and the North. Much of the route was single-track, and the gradient profiles were steep. Despite this, the M&GN was able to put up a spirited competition with the shorter GER route to London from Cromer, although it was never able to equal the GER's excellent timings. However, King's Cross terminus (GNR) was nearer the west end of London, and some passengers preferred to use the M&GN route. The main thrust of M&GN services was to and from the Midlands. The goods traffic was also very heavy, particularly coal inwards, and fruit, vegetables, other agricultural products and fish outwards. The single track (approximately 60% of the route mileage), although operated by the most up-to-date methods (the electric train tablet system) did make the <b>seasonal</b> <b>peak</b> loads difficult to handle - August Bank Holiday weekends were particularly difficult, with waves of special trains from and to the Midlands having to thread their way through the normal traffic of local trains and freights. Typical daily flows during the peak usually exceeded 100 trains.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: This study {{reviewed}} {{previous studies}} {{to explore the}} global patterns of seasonal variation in gastrointestinal diseases. Study Design and Methods: A series of systematic literature reviews were undertaken to identify studies reporting seasonal and monthly data on clinical onset or relapse of gastrointestinal diseases (Acute pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, Peptic ulcer diseases (PUD), gastroesophageal reflux disease, colon cancer and colonic diverticulitis). Thirty-two primary studies (published 1970 - 2012) from 17 countries were identified. Results: Upon review of the evidence, {{it appears that the}} <b>seasonal</b> <b>peaks</b> of PUD are most prominent in colder months while the peak of incidence rate of Crohn diseases in most of the countries subjects were found during the spring and summer seasons. Seasonal trend in the onset of acute pancreatitis exhibits a summer peak in some countries. There were no clearly <b>seasonal</b> <b>peaks</b> noted for the ulcerative colitis. Conclusions: Future experimental and observational studies should consider how the environmental factors (infection, cold, air pollution etc.) or other triggers (dietary habit, alcohol consumption) promotes or hinders such diseases...|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to define the basic {{epidemiology}} of serologically confirmed acute Q fever in patients tested via the Townsville Hospital laboratory from 2000 to 2010 and to determine the impact of geographical location and seasonality on the incidence of acute cases in the Townsville region. Seven Statistical Local Areas (SLA) were identified as having an incidence higher than the average Queensland incidence over the study period.
