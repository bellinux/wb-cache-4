50|$|As {{with many}} issues {{pertinent}} to rice farming in Arkansas, the rates {{and methods of}} fertilization vary depending {{on a number of}} factors. Nitrogen fertilization, as with many crops grown in the United States, often plays {{a significant role in the}} growth of rice within Arkansas. The University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture (U.A.D.A.) suggests different amounts of Nitrogen addition to soil depending on such factors as soil type, rice variety being grown, crop rotation, etc. For example, the U.A.D.A. recommends 150 lb. N/acre ("this recommendation is for N applied in a 2 or 3-way <b>split</b> <b>application</b> where 90 lb N/acre is applied preflood and followed by 60 lb N/acre at midseason") for Wells rice grown in rotation with soybeans on silt/sandy-loam soils. However, a simple change in soil texture from silt/sandy-loam soil to a clay soil induces a 30 lb per acre increase in the recommended amount of Nitrogen to be added to the soil.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{number of}} organic {{vegetable}} farmers in Central Luzon, Philippines grow organic vegetables year round. However, {{most of them}} usually apply the required amount of organic fertilizer only once during planting. Hence, nutrient requirement of vegetables during vegetative or reproductive stages are no longer available. This condition seriously affects the growth and development of vegetables and subsequently affecting the yield performance that may result to low yield. In {{order to reduce the}} potential effect of nutrient deficiency on organic vegetable production the research aims to a) establish frequency of organic fertilizer application employing <b>split</b> <b>application</b> and b) determine the yield performance and net return based on the different treatments used. The research was conducted for two consecutive dry seasons (2012 and 2013) under full organic operation system.

40|$|Water and {{nitrogen}} (N) are two key limiting factors in orange (Citrus sinensis) production. The amount {{and the timing}} of water and N application are critical, but optimal strategies {{have not yet been}} well established. This study presents an analysis of 47 fertigation strategies examined by a coupled soil-crop model. The strategies include 27 main scenarios with a factorial design of 3 irrigation levels (420, 520 and 640 mm, representing 80 %, 100 % and 120 % of water demand), 3 N input levels (100, 200 and 300 kg ha - 1) and 3 main N <b>split</b> <b>applications,</b> and 20 additional scenarios testing alternative N <b>split</b> <b>applications,</b> extreme rainfall years (dry and wet) and different soil textures. The simulations showed that orange yields were strongly influenced by N input and N <b>split</b> <b>applications,</b> but not so much by irrigation. Increasing water and N input led to increased N losses (via leaching and denitrification), and there were significant positive interactions between water and N input with respect to N losses. On average, low N input (100 kg ha - 1) led to relatively low N losses (16 kg ha - 1) but resulted in low yield (33 t ha - 1, 25 % yield reduction). High N input (300 kg ha - 1) produced a high yield (43 t ha - 1) but led to large N losses (104 kg ha - 1). Optimal N input (200 kg ha - 1) significantly reduced N losses (45 kg ha - 1) without yield reduction. Importantly, with optimal N input, improving N <b>split</b> <b>applications</b> significantly increased yield by 13 % and reduced N losses by 40 %, compared to sub-optimal N splits. Significant interactions between water inputs, N inputs and N <b>split</b> <b>applications</b> in yield and N losses indicate that the optimization of fertigation strategies must consider these three key variables simultaneously. Our results clearly show that over-optimal water and N inputs lead to large water and N losses. Reduced irrigation (80 % of water demand) and N input equal to N demand (200 kg ha - 1) can significantly reduce N losses without yield reduction. The N <b>split</b> <b>applications</b> should be adjusted to the N demand of the crop during the growing season.

40|$|NBPT (N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide), a urease inhibitor, {{has been}} {{reported}} {{as one of the}} most promising compounds to maximize urea nitrogen use in agricultural systems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of irrigated wheat fertilized with urea or urea + NBPT as single or <b>split</b> <b>application.</b> The experiment was conducted from June to October 2006 in Viçosa, MG, Brazil. The experimental design followed a 2 × 2 factorial scheme, in which urea or urea + NBPT were combined with two modes of application: full dose at sowing (60 kg ha- 1) or split (20 kg ha- 1 at sowing + 40 kg ha- 1 as topdressing at tillering), in randomized blocks with ten replications. The <b>split</b> <b>application</b> of nitrogen fertilization does not improve the yield wheat under used conditions. The use of urease inhibitor improves the grain yield of wheat crop when urea is applied in topdressing at tillering, but its use does not promote difference when urea is applied in the furrow at planting...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} is to evaluate {{the effect of a}} nitrification inhibitor, 2 Mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), on the nitrification of ammonium nitrogen applied to rice culture by direct sowing on unflooded field, and the yielding effects on the plant growth and grain yield. In addition to this, to get a fundamental information to establish an application method of the fertilizer containing the inhibitor in the rice culture, which is most profitable to increase the yield with less labor repuirement, is also the other purpose. The results obtained were as follows : 1. MBT exhibited considerable effect of the inhibition on the nitrification of applied nitrogen, and NH 4 -N concentrations in soils of + MBT plots were higher than those in soils of -MBT plots during the early period of unflooded state. The inhibitory effect of MBT on nitrification, however, terminated within about 40 days. 2. MBT showed superior effect on the rice plant growth and the effect was large during the initial growth, but during the latter growth, it decreased gradually. Further, it was indicated that the effect decreased also with an increase of the times of <b>split</b> <b>application.</b> The total nitrogen absorption in the plant was higher in the plots of <b>split</b> <b>application</b> than that of whole basal application. And the nitrogen utilization coefficient of rice plant in the +MBT plot of whole basal application considerably higher than that in the -MBT plot, but it was remarkably lower than those in the plots of <b>split</b> <b>application.</b> 3. The yielding effect of MBT on the rice grain yield was clearly recognized in every plots, especially the effect was large in the plot of whole basal application. The grain yield of +MBT plot of whole basal application was lower than those of every-MBT plots of <b>split</b> <b>application.</b> The grain yields of + MBT plots of <b>split</b> <b>application</b> showed the following order: A(8 - 8 - 0 - 0) >D(8 - 3 - 3. 2) ?B(4 - 12 - 0. 0) >C(8 - 6 - 0. 2). 4. From the results mentioned above, it was showed that the MBT added to the fertilizer for basal application exhibited considerable effect on an increase of the rice grain yield. However, it was indicated that, even if the MBT was added to the fertilizer for basal application, some additional dressing was necessary to maintain the predominancy of the initial plant growth till later stage and to get consequently the high grain yield. And, from the result that the grain yields of the plots applicated preponderantly additional dressing at flooded stage (namely, +MBT plots of A (8 8 0 0) and B (4 - 12 0 0)) coresponded to that of the plot applicated the common additional dressing (namely, +MBT plot of D (8 3 3 2)), the omissible possibility of labor by the omission of the additional dressings after having been flooded was suggested. 5. Almost no physiological obstacle of MBT on rice plant was observed throughout all the growing stages. (Received June 30, 1974...|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} with subsurface drip irrigated watermelon {{was conducted on}} a Casa Grande s. l. soil at the Maricopa Agricultural Center in 1992 to evaluate the field performance of two slow release nitrogen (SRN) fertilizers in comparison to a conventional soluble N source, urea, ammonium- nitrate (UAN- 32). Single, preplant applications of 0, 100 and 200 lbs N/acre supplied from methylene urea (Nutralenes) or 100, 150 and 3 (X) lbs N/acre from a methylene urea-ammonium sulfate mixture (MUAS) were evaluated in comparison to treatments of UAN- 32 containing from 52 to 445 lbs N/acre made in five <b>split</b> <b>applications.</b> Yield response to N rates above 100 lbs/acre were similar for all three N sources, indicating that a single, preplant application of a suitable SRN material at an adequate rate could provide N efficiently over the entire growing season. The highest numerical yield (49. 3 tons/acre) was obtained with a N rate of 150 lbs N/acre from the MUAS material. Monitoring of petiole nitrate levels throughout the season indicated that N release from the MUAS was more rapid and more complete than from the methylene-urea product. At suboptimal N rates, i. e. < 150 lbs N/acre, <b>split</b> <b>applications</b> of UAN- 32 appeared to be somewhat more efficient than the slow-release products...|$|R
40|$|Asynchrony between {{nitrogen}} (N) {{released by}} organic materials and N demand by the crop leads to low N use efficiency. Optimizing {{the time of}} application could increase the N recovery. A field experiment was designed {{to determine the effects}} of time of application of Gliricidia sepium prunings and of the addition of small doses of inorganic N fertilizer on N recovery and yield of maize. Six <b>split</b> <b>applications</b> of gliricidia prunings (in October, December and February) were compared. The prunings were incorporated into the soil while fresh. The application in October was done four weeks before planting the maize. Higher N uptake and maize yields were obtained when gliricidia prunings were applied in October than when applied in December and February. The corresponding substitution values were 0. 66, 0. 32 and 0. 20. <b>Split</b> <b>applications</b> of prunings prolonged mineral N availability in the soil until March but did not increase N uptake and maize grain yield compared to a sole application in October. Combinations of gliricidia prunings and inorganic fertilizer increased N uptake and maize yield over prunings alone but the effect was only additive. We concluded that application of gliricidia prunings in October was more efficient than application in December and Februar...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2007 Although {{forage crops}} occupy the {{majority}} of agricultural land in Alaska, best fertilizer management practices to maximize forage yield and quality in Alaska are not well established. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine optimum time and rate of nitrogen (N) fertilizer applications to produce high yields of high quality forage in interior and Southcentral Alaska from smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermus). Nine N fertilization treatments, differing in rate and time of application, were applied at four sites. Forage samples were harvested twice per season in 1999 and 2000 to obtain yield and quality values. Nitrogen applied at 225 kg ha⁻¹ produced greater yields than N applied at 125 kg ha⁻¹, but there were no significant differences between single and <b>split</b> <b>applications.</b> Yield and crude protein content of the control were significantly lower than plots receiving N treatment. Midseason application of N increased crude protein percentages in second cuts at most sites. Acid and neutral detergent fiber were not affected by N treatment. N fertilizer use appeared to be more efficient for <b>split</b> <b>applications,</b> but no significant differences were found. This study showed potential for the production of high yielding, good quality grass forages in Alaska under a variety of N fertilizer strategies...|$|R
