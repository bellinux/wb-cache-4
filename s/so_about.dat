5|$|Property {{losses from}} the fire can be {{accounted}} for with relative certainty as detailed surveys were made immediately afterwards. City surveyor Søren Balle submitted the first survey on 1 November 1728 and on 13 April 1729 the Magistrate of Copenhagen finished a second, made according to a royal request of 12 December 1728. The {{differences between the two}} surveys are limited to the extent of the damages on 43lots, so it is fairly certain that 1,227lots containing about 1,600buildings were lost in flames. All of Copenhagen consisted of about 4,500lots (per the cadastre of 1699), <b>so</b> <b>about</b> 28% of the lots were lost. For the medieval part of town the ratio is 47%.|$|E
5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is monogamous, and {{typically}} mates for life. Birds from pairs often engage in extra-pair copulations, <b>so</b> <b>about</b> 15% of house sparrow fledglings are unrelated to their mother's mate. Male house sparrows guard their mates carefully {{to avoid being}} cuckolded, and most extra-pair copulation occurs away from nest sites. Males may sometimes have multiple mates, and bigamy is mostly limited by aggression between females. Many birds do not find a nest and a mate, and instead may serve as helpers around the nest for mated pairs, a role which increases the chances of being chosen to replace a lost mate. Lost mates of both sexes can be replaced quickly during the breeding season. The formation of a pair and the bond between the two birds {{is tied to the}} holding of a nest site, though paired house sparrows can recognise each other away from the nest.|$|E

25|$|Also {{note that}} {{the whole of the}} {{increase}} in environmental degradation {{is the result of the}} increase of emissions per person being multiplied by a multiplier. If there were fewer people however, this multiplier would be lower, and thus the amount of environmental degradation would be lower as well. As such, the current high level of population has a large impact on this as well. If (as WWF argued), population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level (1/3 of current levels, <b>so</b> <b>about</b> 2 billion people), human inequality can be addressed/corrected, while still not resulting in an increase of environmental damage.|$|E

Tribal people are a majority of the Attappadi population but have a high illiteracy rate of 49.5 per cent and a lack of political and administrative awareness. The majority of project managers and new land owners are from other parts of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and other states.|$|E
25|$|At first Sedgwick {{believed}} that he faced a single brigade of infantry, <b>so</b> <b>about</b> 3:30p.m. he attacked the Confederate positions with only W.T.H. Brooks's division. Brooks succeeded in driving back McLaws's right flank but a counterattack stopped the Union attack and forced Brooks to retreat back to his original position; sunset ended the combat before any further units were involved. During the night, Lee ordered Early to attack Sedgwick's left flank in the morning, while McLaws attacked the Union right. Also during the night, Sedgwick received no further orders from Hooker other than authorization to retreat across the river if Sedgwick thought the move was necessary.|$|E

25|$|Later, vowel {{signs and}} hamzas were added, {{beginning}} {{some time in}} {{the last half of the}} 6th century, at about the same time as the first invention of Syriac and Hebrew vocalization.

25|$|Six {{months after}} the pension deal was reached, however, Governor Paterson {{announced}} he would seek to prevent PEF members from receiving their scheduled 4 percent salary increase and seek furloughs of state workers to help close yet another budget deficit. Paterson raised the issues of furloughs in mid-August, just two {{months after the}} pension deal was reached. PEF countered once again by arguing that the state spent $3 billion a year on 23,000 consultants at a cost that was 62 percent higher than hiring a permanent worker. On April 1, 2010, Paterson demanded that PEF forgo its scheduled wage hike, but PEF refused to do <b>so.</b> <b>About</b> a week later, Paterson withheld the pay increase unilaterally, leading to strong denunciations by the union. Two weeks later, Paterson announced he would seek to furlough half the state's workforce one day a week {{for the rest of the}} year in addition to the wage freeze, and the state legislature appeared ready to agree to the plan. PEF began a legislative lobbying effort, but the legislature approved the furloughs. PEF and other unions sued to overturn the pay freeze and furloughs, and a federal district court temporarily prevented the state from implementing the furlough plan on May 11, 2010. The court also ordered the state to restore the wage increase. The court made the injunction permanent about two weeks later.|$|E

While {{in the mental}} hospitals, she was given [...] "mind-altering" [...] drugs or restrained, depending upon whether she complied or not. She was stigmatized for having been committed and diagnosed with manic depression (now commonly called bipolar disorder). The diagnosis affected how she was perceived by others and her ability to attain employment. In California doctors had recommended that she take lithium to manage wide manic and depression swings. Her depression became more severe when her housing in the Bowery was condemned and Yoshimura threatened divorce. To manage the depression, Millett again began taking lithium.|$|E

500|$|In Shuffle! Essence+, {{there are}} four new storylines {{available}} in the game. Tsubomi is Kareha's younger sister, and like Kareha, she {{has a tendency to}} space out when she see something romantic or cute. Her catchphrase is [...] "Kya! Kya! Kya!". She's the same age as Primula, so they easily become friends. Sakura is Rin's and Kaede's childhood friend, they know each other since elementary school. That's why she knows about Rin's and Kaede's tragic past. Nadeshiko is Rin's homeroom teacher. She's quite self-confident, firmly stepping on the ground, single, attractive and is frequently the victim of pickup lines, including from the Lord of Devils and Itsuki. It appears she has some martial arts training (being able to slice a bottle with her bare hand). She has a habit of dealing out very strong punishments such as writing 100-page reports and dragging a tire around the track for minor offenses. However when it comes speak about romantic relationship or cuteness she can become shy, specially when someone speaks <b>so</b> <b>about</b> her. Daisy is Sia's cousin. When they were kids they used to play a lot together, but because of some circumstances between their fathers both of them stopped playing together. Daisy remember the precious for her time she spend with Lisianthus, but Sia seems to forgotten the old days, when they were together.|$|E

2500|$|The Global Nuclear Energy Partnership, was a U.S. {{proposal}} in the George W.

Reprocessing of spent commercial-reactor nuclear fuel has not been permitted in the United States due to nonproliferation considerations.

It behaves like U-235 and its fission releases a similar amount of energy. The higher the burn-up, the more plutonium in the spent fuel, but the lower the fraction of fissile plutonium. Typically about one percent of the used fuel discharged from a reactor is plutonium, and some two thirds of this is fissile (c. 50% Pu-239, 15% Pu-241). Worldwide, some 70 tonnes of plutonium contained in used fuel is removed when refueling reactors each year.|$|E
