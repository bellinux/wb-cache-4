5|$|Chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems also exist, some {{of which}} perform cell {{functions}} such as responding to stresses, causing cell cycle arrest and bringing about programmed cell death. In evolutionary terms, toxin-antitoxin systems can be considered selfish DNA in {{that the purpose of}} the systems are to replicate, regardless of whether they benefit the host organism or not. Some have proposed adaptive theories to explain the evolution of toxin-antitoxin systems; for example, chromosomal toxin-antitoxin <b>systems</b> <b>could</b> have evolved to prevent the inheritance of large deletions of the host genome. Toxin-antitoxin systems have several biotechnological applications, such as a method of maintaining plasmids in cell lines, targets for antibiotics, and as positive selection vectors.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the MAR, {{which would}} be {{tracking}} targets primarily from the north, the MSR would be tracking its interceptors in all directions. MSR was thus built into a four-faced truncated pyramid, with {{any or all of}} the faces carrying radar arrays. Isolated sites, like the one considered in Hawaii, would normally have arrays on all four faces. Those that were networked into denser <b>systems</b> <b>could</b> reduce the number of faces and get the same information by sending tracking data from site to site.|$|E

5|$|When {{the system}} was first being {{proposed}} {{it was not clear}} whether the phased-array <b>systems</b> <b>could</b> provide the accuracy needed to guide the missiles to a successful interception at very long ranges. Early concepts retained Zeus Missile Tracking Radars and Target Tracking Radars (MTRs and TTRs) for this purpose. In the end, the MAR proved more than capable of the required resolution, and these additional radars were dropped.|$|E
5|$|The 1907 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was at one}} point the only Atlantic {{hurricane season}} that did not feature a hurricane. With only five tropical storms having formed, it was a relatively inactive season; of those that did, three made landfall, of which all occurred on the shoreline of the Gulf Coast of the United States. The first storm of the season formed on June24, while the final dissipated on November12. Damage from the storms were minimal, and no deaths were reported. Due to the lack of modern technology, including satellite imagery, information is often sparse, and four additional <b>systems</b> <b>could</b> have formed during the season. A documentation for four possible storms during the season exists, although it has not been proven that these systems were fully tropical.|$|E

25|$|The policy also {{encouraged}} {{the development of}} the first early warning systems. Conventional war, even at its fastest, was fought over days and weeks. With long-range bombers, from the start of a nuclear attack to its conclusion was mere hours. Rockets could reduce a conflict to minutes. Planners reasoned that conventional command and control <b>systems</b> <b>could</b> not adequately react to a nuclear attack, so great lengths were taken to develop computer systems that could look for enemy attacks and direct rapid responses.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that very large stars, greater than ~100 solar masses, could have planetary systems consisting of hundreds of Mercury-sized planets within the habitable zone. Such <b>systems</b> <b>could</b> also contain brown dwarfs and low-mass stars (~0.1–0.3 solar masses). However the very short lifespans of stars {{of more than a}} few solar masses would scarcely allow time for a planet to cool, let alone the time needed for a stable biosphere to develop. Massive stars are thus eliminated as possible abodes for life.|$|E

25|$|As the BBS {{phenomenon}} grew, so did {{the popularity}} of special interest boards. Bulletin Board <b>Systems</b> <b>could</b> be found for almost every hobby and interest. Popular interests included politics, religion, music, dating, and alternative lifestyles. Many SysOps also adopted a theme in which they customized their entire BBS (welcome screens, prompts, menus, and so on) to reflect that theme. Common themes were based on fantasy, or were intended to give the user the illusion of being somewhere else, such as in a sanatorium, wizard's castle, or on a pirate ship.|$|E
25|$|In 1974 the {{developers}} determined {{that although the}} Buk missile system is the successor to the Kub missile system, both <b>systems</b> <b>could</b> share some interoperability. The result of this decision was the 9K37-1 Buk-1 system. Interoperability between Buk TELAR and Kub TEL meant {{an increase in the}} number of fire control channels and available missiles for each system, as well as faster entry of Buk system components into service. The Buk-1 was adopted into service in 1978 following completion of state trials, while the complete Buk missile system was accepted into service in 1980 after state trials took place between 1977 and 1979.|$|E
25|$|Earthquake warning <b>systems</b> <b>could</b> {{potentially}} {{give people}} {{time to take}} cover {{in the event of}} a quake, preventing injuries caused by falling debris, automatically stopping trains or shutting off gas lines. The system being developed at the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory (called ShakeAlert) in conjunction with the United States Geological Survey, the California Institute of Technology and the University of Washington, will eventually cover the entire West Coast. The system would cost $80 million in funding to run for five years in California, or $120 million for the whole West Coast. In December 2014, United States Congress approved a $5 million allocation as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014 in order to expand funding for development of the system.|$|E
