50|$|Receiving stolen {{property}} {{and possession of}} {{stolen property}} are treated as separate offenses in some jurisdictions. The distinguishing element is when the person knew that <b>the</b> property was <b>stolen.</b> If <b>the</b> person knew that <b>the</b> property was <b>stolen</b> at <b>the</b> time he received it, the crime is receiving <b>stolen</b> property. If <b>the</b> person did not know <b>the</b> property was <b>stolen</b> at <b>the</b> time she received it but found out after receiving possession, the crime is possession of stolen property.|$|R

5|$|Rising anxiety {{levels in}} the white {{settlers}} caused Captain James W. Stephenson to gather 12 volunteers and move toward {{the area of the}} disturbances from Galena. Stephenson recruited more men at Apple River Fort and then traveled eastward.

The militia marched through pounding rain before they finally caught up with the Sauk.|$|E

The fledgling infiltrates the Giovanni mansion and finds the sarcophagus guarded by the Kuei-Jin, who claim their leader, Ming-Xiao, has formed an alliance with LaCroix. The locked sarcophagus is returned to LaCroix's tower and Beckett, a vampire historian, tells the fledgling that {{the only person who}} can open it has been abducted by Grunfeld to lure LaCroix. The fledgling kills Grunfeld and learns that the sarcophagus' key has been stolen.|$|E
5|$|By 1952, {{the farm}} {{had become a}} burden to Olga and her husband. They were both elderly; their sons had moved away; labor was hard to come by; the Colonel {{suffered}} increasing ill-health, and some of Olga's remaining jewelry was <b>stolen.</b> <b>The</b> farm was sold, and Olga, {{her husband and her}} former maid, Mimka, moved to a smaller five-room house at 2130 Camilla Road, Cooksville, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto now amalgamated into the city of Mississauga. Mimka suffered a stroke that left her an invalid, and Olga nursed her until Mimka's death on 24 January 1954.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War {{the temple}} {{was used as}} a post for Air Raid Precautions wardens. It was given Grade I listed status in September 1952 and became part of a {{conservation}} area in the 1960s, when it was used for poetry readings. However, it had become neglected and vandalised by the 1970s. It suffered from wet and dry rot, vibrations from traffic on the busy nearby road had damaged the fabric of the building and thieves had <b>stolen</b> <b>the</b> lead off the roof. Donald Insall Associates, a specialist conservation architectural firm, was commissioned by Richmond upon Thames Council to restore the building at a cost of £37,000. The work was carried out by the building firm Gostling and the architect James Lindus Forge. Patrick Baty advised on the paint colours.|$|E
5|$|Images of the parshvadevatas (attendant deities) {{are placed}} in the central niches of the outer wall (bada) on three sides: the eight-armed Durga slaying Mahishasura on the south; the six-armed goddess Chamunda {{standing}} on Shiva on the west and an empty niche on the north, which probably had a goddess figure that was <b>stolen.</b> <b>The</b> lintel of the attendant deity niche has Gaja Lakshmi figurines. The frames of the niches are decorated with scrollwork and kirtimukha motifs and two female attendants accompany each niche. The uppermost part of the outer wall has ten horizontal mouldings, ornate with scrollwork, kirtimukha and lotus and floral motifs. Within the vimana lies the garbhagriha (sanctum), which is topped with a pancharatha-style, curvilinear temple pinnacle.|$|E

50|$|In many jurisdictions, if an {{individual}} has accepted possession of goods or property and knew they were <b>stolen,</b> then <b>the</b> individual is typically charged with a misdemeanor or felony, depending {{on the value of}} <b>the</b> <b>stolen</b> goods. If <b>the</b> individual did not know <b>the</b> goods were <b>stolen,</b> then <b>the</b> goods are returned to the owner and the individual is not prosecuted. However, there are often exceptions, due to the difficulty of proving or disproving {{an individual}}'s knowledge that <b>the</b> goods were <b>stolen.</b>|$|R

5|$|In the comedic poem Þrymskviða, Thor again plays {{a central}} role. In the poem, Thor wakes and finds that his {{powerful}} hammer, Mjöllnir, is missing.

5|$|Meanwhile, Mercury {{refused to}} let the band record, {{and at the same}} time Stratton-Smith {{refused to let}} the other members of the band sign to Mercury too, as he did not think the deal was fair to the band (only Hammill {{remained}} now of the original three who had signed with Mercury). On top of that in late January 1969 the band's van and equipment were <b>stolen.</b> <b>The</b> theft aggravated their financial difficulties. Although the band was touring successfully, which included a concert in February at the Royal Albert Hall in support of Jimi Hendrix, it broke up in June after playing a final gig at Nottingham's Pop & Blues Festival on 10 May entirely with borrowed equipment. John Peel, who was compering the show, announced their break-up to the audience.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Bonnet resumed command, a bumboat's crew {{told him}} that Blackbeard was moored in Ocracoke Inlet. Bonnet set sail at once to hunt down his treacherous ex-confederate, but could not find him, and Bonnet never met Blackbeard again. Although Bonnet {{apparently}} never discarded his hopes of reaching St. Thomas and getting his letter of marque, two pressing problems now tempted him back into piracy. First, Blackbeard had <b>stolen</b> <b>the</b> food and supplies {{he and his men}} needed to subsist (one pirate testified at his trial that no more than ten or eleven barrels remained aboard the Revenge). Second, St. Thomas was now {{in the midst of the}} Atlantic hurricane season, which would last until autumn. However, returning to freebooting meant nullifying Bonnet's pardon.|$|E

5|$|Texian {{survivors}} of the Battle of Coleto Creek believed their surrender agreement with Urrea would, at worst, mean their deportation. Santa Anna, however, adhered to the 1835 Tornel Decree that stated the insurrection {{was an act of}} piracy fomented by the United States, and ordered their executions. Although he personally disagreed with the need to do so, Urrea carried out his commander's orders on March 27. Of the estimated 370 Texians being held, a few managed to escape the massacre. The remainder were shot, stabbed with bayonets and lances and clubbed with gun butts. Fannin was shot through the face and his gold watch <b>stolen.</b> <b>The</b> dead were cremated on a pyre.|$|E

5|$|The Dude's car {{is found}} by the police without the ransom money, and he reclaims it.

Taking this to mean that Larry was the one who stole the car, Walter and The Dude go to his house, believing Larry has also <b>stolen</b> <b>the</b> money. When Larry refuses to respond to Walter and the Dude's threats, Walter wrecks a new sports car parked outside which they assume Larry bought with the money. However, a neighbor rushes outside, reveals himself as having just bought the car and angrily wrecks The Dude's car in revenge, thinking it to be Walter's.|$|E
5|$|The {{early works}} of Tevaram by the 7th-century poets Appar and Tirugnanasambandar mention {{the town had}} {{fortified}} walls, busy road building and a busy port.

A Buddhist pagoda was built under Chinese influence by the Pallava king and the town was frequented by Buddhist travelers. Thirumangai Azhwar, the 9th century vaishnavite saint poet, is believed to have <b>stolen</b> <b>the</b> golden Buddha statue to fund the Ranganathaswamy Temple at Srirangam; the authenticity of the theory is questionable.|$|E
