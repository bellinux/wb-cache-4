Bamber also began selling his family's belongings; Mugford's mother was offered June's car and an ad {{was placed in a}} local newspaper asking ₤900 for Nevill's. Just after his first arrest and release in September, Bamber tried to sell 20 nude photographs of Sheila for ₤20,000 to The Sun, and went on another overseas trip with a friend, Brent, this time to Saint-Tropez.|$|E
5|$|In mid-April, Armbrust rockets {{were fired}} from Croatian {{positions}} outside Borovo Selo into the village. According to {{one version of}} the event, several rounds were fired at agricultural machinery that served as barricades in the outskirts of Borovo Selo. According to a second version, three rockets were fired on the village with the specific aim of inflaming ethnic tensions. One of the rockets hit a house and another landed in a field, failing to explode. There were no casualties, but the already tense situation was made worse when the unexploded rocket was shown on Serbian Television as evidence of Croatian aggression against Serbs. The rockets were fired {{by a group of}} men that were led to the site by Osijek police chief Josip Reihl-Kir, who was later murdered by Croat irregulars. Croatia's interior minister Josip Boljkovac <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> included Deputy Defence Minister Gojko Šušak, Branimir Glavaš and Vice Vukojević. Šušak claimed {{he had nothing to do}} with the incident but had been in the area at the time. Nikola Jaman, at the time a commander of the local Police Reserve unit, said that he led the action and denied that Šušak, Glavaš and Vukojević were in the group. Jaman noted that the action was planned together with Reihl-Kir.|$|E

50|$|Most critics <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>group's</b> modest ambitions were {{fresh and}} relaxing. During 1989 and 1990 the album won many accolades, {{including}} a Grammy for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or <b>Group.</b> <b>The</b> album was also nominated for Album of the Year.|$|R

25|$|Material for Red's sixth album, Gone, {{was already}} being worked on in November 2016, {{with the main}} {{rehearsal}} sessions taking place the month after. Anthony Armstrong expressed a shift in releasing albums in the traditional way due to the decline in physical sales and the popularity of digital music. He also <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> would stray from the Christian rock element of their music into the general music market, including radio airplay. Gone was officially announced in September 2017, and released on October 27. A 17-track deluxe edition will be available.|$|E
25|$|Gen. Anaya {{stated in}} his written battle report that 35 San Patricios were killed, 85 taken {{prisoner}} (including a wounded John Riley, Captain O'Leary and Anaya); about 85 escaped with retreating Mexican forces. Some 60% of the San Patricios {{were killed or}} captured in the engagement. The survivors were reformed before the Battle of Mexico City some two weeks later and were stationed at Querétaro where the Mexican government had decamped, with some 50 members serving as a body-guard for the commander-in-chief. The battalion were {{caught up in the}} infighting and politicking of Mexico at the time, and were under the patronage of a faction that favored suing for ending of the conflict peacefully. New units were later made up of the free survivors of the battle of Churubusco and a roughly equal number of fresh deserters from the U.S. Army. Following the war, the Mexican Government insisted in a clause of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that the remaining San Patricio prisoners held by the Americans were to be left in Mexico, and Major General William Orlando Butler issued General Orders 116 on June 1, 1848 stating that; “The prisoners confined at the Citadel, known as the San Patricio prisoners, will be immediately discharged"—Rogue’s March was played upon their release. The Saint Patrick's battalion continued to function as two infantry companies under the command of John Riley, with one unit tasked with sentry duty in Mexico City and the other was stationed in the suburbs of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The San Patricios were officially mustered out of Mexican military service in 1848; some members were alleged to have been involved in an abortive military coup, while historians have <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> was disbanded because of Mexican budget cuts.|$|E

5000|$|In 1993, <b>the</b> <b>group</b> deluged {{lawmakers in}} Congress with letters objecting to {{efforts by the}} FDA to {{regulate}} labeling for nutritional supplements.

500|$|Townshend now {{considers}} Quadrophenia to be {{the last}} great album that the Who recorded. In 2011, he <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> [...] "never recorded anything that was so ambitious or audacious again", drawing particular praise for Moon's playing.|$|E
500|$|Following the Queen Elizabeth Hall performance, {{the band}} members {{discussed}} working together. In mid-2004, they began to write and rehearse new material. The result was a double CD, Present, released in April 2005. Critical response was favourable; BBC Music's Peter Marsh <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> was [...] "willing {{to push the envelope}} a little, and bless them for that", while AllMusic' Dave Thompson <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> [...] "never made a less than fabulous album in their lives. And they're not about to start now." [...] A reunion concert took place at the Royal Festival Hall, London, on 6 May 2005, which was released as Real Time in March 2007. The Festival Hall concert was followed by several European dates in the summer and autumn. The concert in Leverkusen, Germany on 5 November was filmed for the Westdeutscher Rundfunk TV show Rockpalast, which was broadcast on 16 January 2006.|$|E
500|$|The band look favourably on the album. Hastings later <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> [...] "began to peak in many ways" [...] {{and praised}} in {{particular}} David Sinclair's playing and Hitchcock's production skills.

2500|$|The Council of Conservative Citizens, whose website Roof {{cited as}} a source for his radicalization, issued a {{statement}} on its website [...] "unequivocally condemn" [...] the attack, but that Roof has some [...] "legitimate grievances" [...] against black people.

500|$|IGN's Chad Grischow <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> charged [...] "full steam {{ahead with}} the most rock focused album of their career". He noted the album took the [...] "harder edge of their last album" [...] and moulded it [...] "into {{something}} they, and their fans, should be much happier with". In a brief review for Newsday, Glenn Gamboa {{said it was a}} [...] "testament" [...] to the group's talent that they can [...] "turn essentially a transition album into something that sounds this good". PopMatters reviewer Kiel Hauck wrote that Lazzara and Nolan's call-and-response vocals, featured on the group's debut, were placed [...] "perfect throughout the record" [...] as the pair [...] "create a beautiful combination that serves as a reminder of what made this band so special in the first place". Tori Pederson of Punknews.org <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> [...] "sound like a well-oiled machine here," [...] producing [...] "arguably the best album of their career" [...] in the process. Spins Mikael Wood wrote that the album showcases the group's [...] "crafty songwriting rather than the psychological intensity" [...] that dominated their debut.|$|E
500|$|An early {{title for}} the album was When All Is Said and Done More Is Said Than Done, {{suggested}} by Fazzi. The group liked it, however, Fazzi said it was [...] "way too long to fit on a side of a CD". According to Lazzara, the album was given the title New Again because [...] "that's what it feels like. We are in a totally different band, just {{because there has been}} this new life breathed into the band with the addition of Matt." [...] The album was written in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Here, Rubano <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> [...] "stuck out on the street because we were so loud". For the album, the band embraced the concept that [...] "it's up to us to decide what Taking Back Sunday sounds like. We always want to be redefining what that means, and there's stuff on this record I think in the past we would have stayed away from", according to Rubano. Fazzi <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> wanted to [...] "put a new foot forward ... to show people that we're expanding the music". He noted that the song structures and chord patterns were [...] "just a bit stronger and smarter".|$|E
500|$|Punknews.org {{contributor}} GlassPipeMurder said [...] "Fast Forward to 2012" [...] was [...] "incredibly promising" [...] {{but within}} [...] "mere seconds the melodic punk {{is replaced by}} vocals that sound like a post-Taco Bell burrito belch". About the band playing [...] "The Price We Pay", he also <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> had fallen [...] "equally flat with their attempt at acoustic emo pop" [...] with [...] "horrifically banal lyrics". Rolling Stone magazine said the album was [...] "among the 40 most important new releases of the month".|$|E
2500|$|A {{former member}} of the Knesset, Yossi Sarid, <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>group's</b> members [...] "are people who seize every {{opportunity}} to defend Israel publicly and remain faithful to it.

500|$|With Reckoning, Dixon, Easter and {{the band}} wanted to capture the energy of R.E.M.'s live sound. Dixon {{had not seen the}} band perform live before working on Murmur; after he had done so, he had a greater sense of the band's {{strengths}} and weaknesses. Dixon wanted the guitars to sound more like they did in concert, but at first met resistance from both the band and the label. However, by the time R.E.M. started to record, Dixon <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> [...] "wanted to rock out a bit more".|$|E

Eventually, bassist Joshua Woodard and Westfall recruited drummer Alex Shelnutt only three days before going on tour. Upon being asked, Shelnutt's response was [...] "Ask my mom", as he was 15 at the time. Upon Shelnutt joining, Westfall <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> [...] "started sounding like a real professional band. He gave us something we never had before." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Cowart {{belonged to}} the Supreme White Alliance, a white {{supremacist}} group.

On the group's social networking site, Cowart described himself as [...] "easygoing and easy to get along with, {{as long as you}} are white!" [...] Cowart was allegedly kicked out of the group sometime prior to his arrest. The club's president, Steve Edwards of Central City, Kentucky, resigned due to the negative press following Cowart's arrest.

500|$|The Who {{had planned}} to perform Tommy live since {{starting}} the project. The group spent April 1969 rehearsing a live version of the show at the Hanwell Community Centre in Ealing including a final run down of the entire stage piece on 23 April. The running order was changed, and four songs ("Cousin Kevin", [...] "Underture", [...] "Sensation" [...] and [...] "Welcome") were dropped entirely. Townshend later <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> [...] "did the whole thing {{from start to finish}} and that was when we first realized we had something cohesive and playable." [...] Daltrey's voice had improved substantially since the group's early tours, and they realised their new live act could completely change their career.|$|E
500|$|Corgan and Chamberlin {{continued}} to {{record as a}} duo, releasing the four-song EP American Gothic in January 2008 and the singles [...] "Superchrist" [...] and [...] "G.L.O.W."

In late 2008, the band commenced on a controversy-riddled 20th Anniversary Tour. Around this time, Corgan <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> will make no more full-length records in order to focus exclusively on singles, explaining, [...] "The listening patterns have changed, so why are we killing ourselves to do albums, to create balance, and do the arty track {{to set up the}} single?

500|$|U2's {{subsequent}} concert tour, 1997's PopMart Tour, {{followed in}} Zoo TV's footsteps by mocking another social trend, this time consumerism. Paul McGuinness <b>said</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> wanted [...] "the production [...] to beat Zoo TV", and accordingly, the tour's spectacle was a further {{shift away from}} their austere stage shows of the 1980s; PopMart's stage featured a [...] LED screen, a [...] golden arch containing the sound system, and a mirrorball lemon {{that served as a}} transport to the B-stage. Although critics were much less receptive to PopMart, in a 2009 interview, Bono said that he considers that tour to be their best: [...] "Pop(Mart) is our finest hour. It's better than Zoo TV aesthetically, and as an art project it is a clearer thought." ...|$|E
