40|$|Design {{requirements}} for photovoltaic modules and arrays used in {{commercial and industrial}} applications were identified. Building codes and referenced standards were reviewed for their applicability to commercial and industrial photovoltaic array installation. Four general installation types were identified - integral (replaces roofing), direct (mounted on top of roofing), stand-off (mounted away from roofing), and rack (for flat or low slope roofs, or ground mounted). Each of the generic <b>mounting</b> <b>types</b> {{can be used in}} vertical wall mounting systems. This implies eight <b>mounting</b> <b>types</b> exist in the commercial/industrial sector. Installation costs were developed for these <b>mounting</b> <b>types</b> as a function of panel/module size. Cost drivers were identified. Studies were performed to identify optimum module shapes and sizes and operating voltage cost drivers. The general conclusion is that there are no perceived major obstacles to the use of photovoltaic modules in commercial/industrial arrays...|$|R
40|$|I {{report on}} the {{development}} of new code to support the Nasmyth and E-W antenna <b>mount</b> <b>types</b> in AIPS which will allow polarisation analysis of observations made using these uncommon antenna configurations. These <b>mount</b> <b>types</b> may become more widely spread as they have several advantages, particularly for geodetic observatories. Multi-band observations, with multiple receivers, can only be fitted into telescopes with Nasmyth feeds. These are the requirements for the new generation of geodetic arrays as discussed in IVS 2010. Further more the next generation of antennae will also be required to have very high slew rates, and these can be achieved with the E-W <b>mount.</b> The <b>mount</b> <b>type</b> affects the differential phase between {{the left and the right}} hand circular polarisations (LHC and RHC) for different points on the sky. The target antennae for the project was the Yebes 40 m telescope, but as that was still under construction the data used as a demonstration was from the Pico Veleta antenna as part of the Global Millimeter VLBI Array (GMVA). For the E-W <b>mount</b> <b>type</b> there are suitable data from the Australian LBA array. I demonstrate the effectiveness of the changes made and that the Nasmyth and E-W corrections can be applied.

40|$|The <b>mount</b> <b>type</b> HVAC {{control system}} {{is a type of}} HVAC control system which is {{installed}} between a ceiling and the ceiling boards of a room to control room temperature. Although the device is quite popular, design is conducted by a conventional way where engineering intuition and experiences are utilized. It is found that the design process is fairly inefficient and time-consuming {{because there are a lot}} of feedbacks. The axiomatic approach is used to investigate the design characteristics of the <b>mount</b> <b>type</b> HVAC control system and the Independence Axiom is utilized for the investigation. The overall hierarchy is established up to the level of components. It is found that the current design has many coupled and redundant aspects. The hierarchy is reorganized based on the Independence Axiom and a new design process is found. To exploit the new design process in practice, a design manual is made.

40|$|Optimal {{design of}} {{magnetohydrodynamic}} (MHD) thruster systems for a superconducting electromagnetic propulsion ship is presented. Optimal designs of the configurations of thrusters are searched for {{three kinds of}} thruster systems, namely, the inner ducting, the annular ducting and the pod <b>mount</b> <b>type</b> which are designed to install an experimental ship with SWATH hulls. After that, the optimal design maximizing the propulsive efficiency is examined and evaluated. The {{results show that the}} inner ducting type is of the highest propulsive efficiency, while the annular type is lowest. And the pod <b>mount</b> <b>type</b> is ranked between these two. In general, however, efficiency of a MHD thruster system is very low compared with conventional propulsion systems. In order to improve the efficiency, level-up of superconducting technology including new-material is urged. ...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf [44]) Fatigue failures {{are known}} to occur in leads of surface mount electronic components, when electronic printed circuit assemblies are subjected to severe vibrational loads. Exposure to random vibration is a test criterion used to screen, compare, and validate components for automotive and aerospace applications. As a result, the reliability of surface <b>mount</b> <b>type</b> interconnections is reduced. Fatigue life of leads in such packages is a complex function of constitutive properties, architecture and geometry of the package and vibrational loads applied to it. A logical and consistent method for calculating fatigue life due to random vibration is needed. Finite element analysis is sometimes employed to help understand or correct random vibration induced failures. The main objective {{of the present study}} is to formulate a model based on finite element analysis, to analyze fatigue endurance of leads in surface <b>mount</b> <b>type</b> packages. The goal is to formulate a tool which can be used to examine the influence of several parameters on fatigue life of leads. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R
