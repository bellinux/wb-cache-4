Three families of photodiodes were examined. 4 H-SiC vertical Schottky UV photodiodes with Ni 2 Si interdigitated contacts were characterised for their response under dark and UV illumination. Electrical characterisation up to 120 °C and room temperature responsivity measurements (210 nm to 380 nm) suggested that the devices could operate at low UV light intensities, even at high visible and IR backgrounds {{without the use of}} filters, and at high temperatures. 4 H-SiC Schottky photodiode detector arrays with planar thin NiSi contacts were investigated for X-ray (≤ 35 keV) detection and photon counting spectroscopy at 33 °C. The electrical characterisation of the devices up to 140 °C and subsequent analysis suggested that the devices are likely to operate as high temperature X-ray spectrometers. Results characterising GaAs p+-i-n+ mesa photodiode detectors for their room temperature visible and near infrared responsivity (580 nm to 870 nm), as well as their high temperature (≤ 60 °C) X-ray detection performance (at 5. 9 keV) are presented.

Indeed, sub-femtosecond fractional frequency instability at one second averaging {{can now be}} achieved. A self-referenced femtosecond laser frequency comb (FLFC) {{is used as a}} frequency divider to provide a phase-coherent link between optical and microwave domains, dividing the frequency down to the gigahertz range while also transferring the stability of the original signal. Photodetectors then convert the optical pulses into electronic signals. The resultant 10 GHz microwave signals have ultra-low phase noise below - 100 dBc/Hz at 1 Hz offset, surpassing that of traditional microwave oscillators. This new approach offers significant improvement for many applications that rely on stable microwave signals, and may even create new measurement technologies otherwise unachievable with current signal sources. In reality, fundamental and technical sources of noise in each stage of the optical-to-microwave generation process limit the ultimate achievable stability of the signal. Optical reference cavities are limited by environmental effects and thermal fluctuations, and FLFC dividers suffer from intrinsic timing jitter, amplitude noise, and limited stabilization servo bandwidth. However, it is the seemingly straightforward photodetection of optical pulses that proves to be the limiting factor in the ultimate noise floor of these signals.

We find that the quasi-static behavior of the nanoparticles can explain the observed modulation in the absorption spectra. We also apply the same methods of simulation and experiment to Silicon-on-Insulator photodetectors. The coupling between the nanoparticles and waveguide modes in the silicon film leads to large increases in absorption, particularly in the infrared wavelengths, where silicon is a poor absorber. We find that we can engineer the absorption enhancement spectra by controlling the nanoparticle distribution. Another application that we investigate is in UV multi-spectral imaging.
