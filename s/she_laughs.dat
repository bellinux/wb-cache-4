5|$|As the {{breakdown}} happens, the soldiers bind {{her on the}} chair but <b>she</b> <b>laughs,</b> kicks and spits on them. Midst the aggressive fighting, the white Madonna takes a speargun and shoots the black Madonna squarely on the chest. The black Madonna falls down and concurrently a soldier pulls the switch on the electric chair. They laugh loudly thinking Madonna to be burnt but as the smoke clears, they see that no remnants are to be found. They rush to inspect the chair closely and notice three letters (לאו) being burnt in the chair. They scratch their head and see {{a vision of a}} bearded man laughing at them. Madonna is shown running from the torture chamber and opens the door, as the video ends with the gun barrel sequence.|$|E

60|$|Alvina did not care. She rather liked it. She {{liked being}} déclassée. She liked feeling an outsider. At last {{she seemed to}} stand on her own ground. <b>She</b> <b>laughed</b> {{to herself as she}} went back and forth from Woodhouse to Lumley, between Manchester House and the Pleasure Palace. <b>She</b> <b>laughed</b> when <b>she</b> saw her father's theatre-notices {{plastered}} about. <b>She</b> <b>laughed</b> when <b>she</b> saw his thrilling announcements in the Woodhouse Weekly. <b>She</b> <b>laughed</b> when <b>she</b> knew that all the Woodhouse youths recognized her, and looked on her as one of their inferior entertainers. She was off the map: and she liked it.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>laughed</b> gaily--and <b>she</b> had a {{way when}} <b>she</b> <b>laughed</b> of {{throwing}} back her head and showing her beautiful white teeth, so that mirth from her was a thing very much to be desired.|$|R
5|$|Giles' dream {{begins with}} Giles {{swinging}} a watch {{in front of}} Buffy. They are in Giles' apartment, which has been stripped of furniture but for a chair and a bed. <b>She</b> <b>laughs,</b> and Giles' dream cuts to a family scene with Buffy and his girlfriend Olivia at a fairground. Quicker than the others to understand that something is wrong, he confronts Spike, who is posing for a photo-shoot in his crypt. In The Bronze, he meets Anya failing as a stand-up comic, and Willow and Xander (with a bloody chest wound), who warn him of their attacker. He breaks into song, giving {{suggestions on how to}} deal with what hunts them, but when the sound system breaks down, he crawls backstage to trace a wiring fault. He begins to realize his pursuer is the First Slayer, just as she scalps him.|$|E

60|$|That pity was {{reflected}} on his countenance now, and noting its solemnity, and misconstruing it, <b>she</b> <b>laughed</b> outright, despite herself. He {{did not ask}} her why <b>she</b> <b>laughed,</b> he did not notice it; his thoughts were busy already upon another matter.|$|R

500|$|Throughout the song, {{the narrator}} {{addresses}} an unidentified girl, asking [...] "When {{will you come}} with me", and lamenting the fact that <b>she</b> <b>laughs</b> at him for having nothing to his name. He tells her {{he wants to give}} her his hopes and bring her freedom, that [...] "the earth is turning under your feet" [...] and [...] "the waters of life are flowing free", yet she persists in scorning him. He asks why <b>she</b> <b>laughs</b> at the pack he carries on his back, and he wonders why he keeps on going, with nothing to his name. At last, he tells her that he has waited for a long time, and that this is his final plea: he wants to grab her by the hands, to [...] "take you away with me". As he sees her hands tremble, and her eyes [...] "overflow with tears", he asks her, [...] "Do you really mean to tell me, you love me as I am?" ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Pascua of The Huffington Post also praised Ramirez's performance, {{calling her}} [...] "the most genuine character". Although he enjoyed Ramirez's performance, Pascua was {{critical}} {{of the rest of}} the episode, writing: [...] "The funeral wasn't as sad as I thought it would be. There were so many pre-episode pictures up that I thought the funeral would take up half the show, then it was five minutes and it wasn't sad at all. The core group walked away and Izzie spread the giggles. <b>She</b> <b>laughs</b> at the fact that she has cancer, like this was all some really badly written show. Oh wait, it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One {{never seemed}} {{able to get}} out of it," [...] <b>she</b> <b>laughed.</b> Of course there was the library, and dear Mr. Jones, and notions about things. [...] "I used to stray into the kitchen and sit upon the butler's knees," [...] <b>she</b> <b>laughed,</b> sadly though.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>laughed</b> at him—he felt <b>she</b> was <b>laughing</b> at his {{expression}} of face—and her laugh rang through the stately gardens. “What {{sort of a}} woman’s that?” ...|$|R

500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} {{directed}} by Melina Matsoukas was filmed between August 20 and August 21, 2012 in Los Angeles. A cut from the video premiered on NBC's The Voice on September 17. A video teaser was released on Aguilera's YouTube channel on September 17, 2012. The official music video premiered on Vevo on September 28, 2012. Aguilera commented about the collaboration with Matsoukas, [...] "Once we started talking {{with each other and}} she heard 'Your Body,' she spun {{it in a way that}} you wouldn't expect at all. And I get to play this character that, yeah, she may be a little bit of a badass, she's very confident, self-assured, but she's super playful and super tongue-in-cheek. <b>She</b> <b>laughs</b> the whole way through the video. She's watching cartoons, and you know she doesn't take herself too seriously." ...|$|E
500|$|Her {{characteristic}} dimple {{has been}} cited by the media as her trademark. At {{the beginning of her}} career, she was often described by the press as having a vivacious personality and a bubbly, outgoing persona, an image she had confessed to disliking. According to film critic Sukanya Verma, Zinta's energetic nature extends from her real life into her appearances in films and {{is an integral part of}} her technique. In an article discussing Hindi film actresses and their flair for comedy, Verma wrote, [...] "What can you say about an actress who giggles non-stop in a tone that is anything but prim and propah? She is carefree. She is animated. She talks non-stop. <b>She</b> <b>laughs</b> all the time. She has a chilled out sense of humour. And a tomboyish streak too. Preity Zinta is all that and more. All this greatly contributes to her style of acting." ...|$|E
500|$|Angelou's {{humor in}} Caged Bird {{and in all}} her autobiographies is drawn from Black {{folklore}} and is used to demonstrate {{that in spite of}} severe racism and oppression, Black people thrive and are, as Hagen states, [...] "a community of song and laughter and courage". Hagen states that Angelou is able to make an indictment of institutionalized racism as <b>she</b> <b>laughs</b> at her flaws and the flaws of her community and [...] "balances stories of black endurance of oppression against white myths and misperceptions". Hagen also characterize Caged Bird as a [...] "blues genre autobiography" [...] because it uses elements of blues music. These elements include the act of testimony when speaking of one's life and struggles, ironic understatement, and the use of natural metaphors, rhythms, and intonations. Hagen also sees elements of African American sermonizing in Caged Bird. Angelou's use of African-American oral traditions creates a sense of community in her readers, and identifies those who belong to it.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Tetterby did {{not enjoy}} her supper. There seemed to be {{something}} on Mrs. Tetterby's mind.

500|$|While flirting, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) reveals he {{is ready}} to propose to Pam, even going as far as telling her that {{he is not going to}} do it at work ("because that would be rather lame") and when he does it, it will [...] "kick her ass". Pam is not sure if he's joking. Alone with the camera, Jim reveals that he was not joking and shows an {{engagement}} ring that he bought [...] "the week after [...] started dating." [...] After work, while walking back to his car, he stops and gets down on one knee. When Pam stops and looks he says he has a question to ask her. After a second or so of hesitation, he asks her if she will wait while he ties his shoes. <b>She</b> <b>laughs</b> and they continue walking hand in hand. [...] At the end of the episode, Michael and Dwight are seen singing [...] "American Pie" [...] and dancing in the same cemetery at night, presumably having never left.|$|E

He also is ignorant of the ways of Coney, but in turn appeals to his friend Casey, a ward politician, who of course knows the Island, and consents to act as their escort. The three set out for Coney and start on their search for Kate. The hunt is almost forgotten in the joys of looping the loop, shooting the chutes and various other diversions of the Island.
