50|$|Stage 2 {{development}} was undertaken 1974-1976 at a further cost of $12 million. It included a chip screening system, a new chipper and conveying, four refiners, dewatering machines, another flash drier and <b>slab</b> <b>press,</b> two bale presses and a wrapping system. This lifted production to 600-700 ADT per day.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{problem that}} the pinch roll of the <b>Slab</b> Size <b>Press</b> was worn away partly {{appeared}} in some domestic steel mill so based on the DEFORM finite element software a pressing mode 1 for <b>Slab</b> Sizing <b>Press</b> was established. After analyzing the deformation of dog bone by the modeling experiment finite element, {{a new kind of}} roll is brought forward. The contact condition between pinch roll and <b>pressed</b> <b>slab</b> is improved by it so that the use time of the pinch roll is extended...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The back {{group of}} the pinch rolls of the 1880 <b>Slab</b> Size <b>Press</b> are wearing away seriously in some {{domestic}} steel mill, so based on the finite element software a sizing press mode 1 is established. The major reason of the back pinch rolls wearing away is the partly contact between the rolls and the “dog-bone ” of the <b>pressed</b> <b>slab.</b> The work condition of the new bank {{group of the}} pinch rolls is greatly improved in the production line {{and the cost of}} production is saved...|$|R
60|$|The {{right hand}} of the subject, which should be quite passive, is taken by the operator, and the bulbs of his four fingers laid flat on the inked <b>slab</b> and <b>pressed</b> gently but firmly on it by the {{flattened}} {{hand of the}} operator. Then the inked fingers are laid flat upon {{the upper part of}} the right-hand side of the card (Plate 2, Fig. 3), and pressed down gently and firmly, just as before, by the flattened hand of the operator. This completes the process for one set of prints of the four fingers of the right hand. Then the bulb of the thumb is slightly rolled on the inked slab, and again on the lower part of the card, which gives a more extended but not quite so sharp an impression. Each of the four fingers of the same hand, in succession, is similarly rolled and impressed. This completes the process for the second set of prints of the digits of the right hand. Then the left hand is treated in the same way.|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to know influence of plasticizer naphtenic oil to the physical properties of tensile strength and elongation at break of rubber compound for cowmats. It makes from Rubber Smoke Sheet (RSS) and Styrene Butadiene Rubber 1502 (SBR) as raw material with addition ingredients are Calcium Carbonate, FEF black, Stearic Acid, Zinc Oxide, Plasticizer Naphtenic Oil, Paraffine Wax, TMT, CBS, AOSP and Sulphur as Vulcanizing agent. Rubber compound for cowmats, formed to <b>slab</b> by hydraulic <b>press</b> at 1500 C and 150 Kg/cm 2. Than tested tensile strength and elongation at break. The result of {{this research}} indicated that platicizer naphtenic oil (x) and tensile strength have regression equation as Y 1 = 24. 168 – 0. 634 X (r = 0. 87), while naphtenic oil and elongation at break have regression equation as Y 2 = 236. 32 + 21 X (r = 0. 88). ...|$|R
40|$|Leslie Stephen {{made the}} first ascent of the Rothorn on August 22, 1864. He {{followed}} Melchior Anderegg and described 2 ̆ 2 fumbling vaguely with my fingers at imaginary excrescences, my feet resting upon rotten projections of crumbling stone, whilst a large pointed <b>slab</b> of rock <b>pressed</b> against my stomach, and threatened to force my centre of gravity backwards beyond the point of support. My chief reliance was upon the rope; and with a graceful flounder I was presently landed in safety upon a comparatively sound ledge. 2 ̆ 2 From this point, he looked back and saw a picture that became fixed in his imagination and was engraved by Edward Whymper: Florence Crauford Grove and Jakob Anderegg scrambling up the same ledge. Stephen recalled his ascent of this peak now known as Zinalrothorn as 2 ̆ 2 the nastiest piece of climbing I had ever accomplished. 2 ̆ 2 Source: frontispiece of The Playground of Europe (London, 1871).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to know influence of process oil to the physical properties tensile strength and elongation at break of rubber compound for hand water pump. Vulcanized rubber makes from Rubber Smoke Sheet (RSS) and Styrene Butadiene Rubber (SBR 1502) as raw material. Ingredient which added to raw material were Paraffin Wax, Strearic Acid, ZnO, CaCO 3, Carbon Black, Process Oil, CBS, TMT, AOSP and Sulphur. Raw material rubber and ingredient were compounded in a two roll mill and formed to <b>slab</b> by hydraulic <b>press</b> at temperature 1500 C and pressure 150 kg/cm 2. It should be carry out by varying process oil 3 – 9 part by weight raw material. The compound was tested tensile strength and elongation at break. The result of this research indicated that process oil (X 1) and tensile strength (Y 1) have regression equation as Y 1 = 235, 697 – 8, 33 X (correlation coeffisien = 0, 72) while process oil and elongation at break has regression equation as Y 2 = 251, 64 + 12, 75 X (correlation coeffisien = 0, 97). ...|$|R
40|$|Joy??? expresses {{perfectly}} {{my intention}} in life, and clay is my chosen medium to convey it. There {{are too many}} daily issues that {{must be dealt with}} that have the opposite effect of joy. I would like my work {{to be a source of}} delight, to reveal happiness, fun, excitement, and to create a fantasy that blocks out the negativity in the world. I work, in general,. with <b>slabs</b> of clay <b>pressed</b> through a slab-roller with wrinkled cotton sheeting on top of them. The imprint of the sheeting leaves an abstract design which I use in building my forms and also when I glaze them. I began to explore the handbuilt teapot form from which developed entire tableware sets, subsequently leading total environments of ceramics, utensils and tables. Handbuilding enables me to create non-traditional forms which have evolved into my present style of tableware. Color is of prime importance to me as it expresses joy. For me, color is most easily defined by that seen in a rainbow. I use white stoneware for its durability and the ease it allows in forming whimsical shapes. The white clay also serves as a better surface for color than dark clay. Philosophically, I feel that brightly colored glazed pieces enhance the areas that they occupy and lighten the spirits of the people who experience them. Form, col or and function are what I have found to be of concern to me. My discovery of the majolica technique was made during a lecture by Vivika Heino. This was a great stroke of luck for me as it offered me just what I was looking for. The name 'majolica' comes from Majorca. (Daniel Rhodes, Clay and Glazes for the Potter, Radnor, Pennsylvania: Chilton Book Company, 1973, p. 259.) It is an overglaze technique in which the raw base glaze, usually white or light-colored, is first put on bisqued ware. Colored overglazes are then painted on top of this raw background glaze. Although majolica glazes are generally thought to be lowfired, the one that I use is fired between Cone 8 and 10 in an oxidation atmosphere. The formula for the base glaze is: Custer Feldspar 52. 3...|$|R
