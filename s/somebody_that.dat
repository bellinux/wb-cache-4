5|$|Pierce {{cast the}} actors by {{approaching}} customers {{at a local}} gas station whenever he saw <b>somebody</b> <b>that</b> looked like they fit one of the parts. He hired high school students as crew members who helped load and move equipment. For the creature itself, he limited the sightings to shadowy figures because he felt the film would be more frightening if the creature was left to the viewer's imagination. Pierce sang the theme song featured in the film. Once the film was completed, he put the reel {{into the trunk of}} his car and drove to Los Angeles seeking post-production services. He met Jamie Mendoza-Nava, who owned a small post-production company and agreed to work on the film for limited up-front pay and {{a small percentage of the}} film's box-office receipts. Pierce could not find a major studio willing to distribute it, so he rented a local movie theater in Texarkana for one week to screen the film. He cleaned the property himself to prepare for the debut.|$|E
25|$|Matt {{had also}} {{wondered}} why people were chasing {{him and the}} unknown female character, but it all {{ends up in the}} Chicago area in the game. One morning, somebody took the keys from Matt's car that the unknown female character got him, and stole the car. Matt has to follow the person and had to follow the driver. As it turns out, the driver that took the keys, was the unknown female character in his perspective. She later gives a case to <b>somebody</b> <b>that</b> knows her, and Matt is forced to leave the area without her.|$|E
25|$|You shouldn't make friends. It's not a {{good thing}} to be friends with people you're covering. There's just no point in doing it. It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're <b>somebody</b> <b>that</b> can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, {{and you just have to}} fend that off all the time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So you always have to keep that in mind.|$|E

25|$|Frankie Laine was <b>somebody</b> <b>that</b> {{everybody}} knew. He {{was a kind}} of {{a household}} word like Frank Sinatra or Bobby Darin or Peggy Lee or Ella Fitzgerald—Frankie Laine {{was one of the great}} popular singers and stylists of that time…And his style…he was one of those artists who had such a unique stamp—nobody sounded like he did. You could hear two notes and you knew who it was and you were right on the beam with it right away. And of course that defines a successful popular artist, at least at that time. These people were all uniquely individual and Frank was on the front rank of those people in his appeal to the public and his success and certainly in his identifiability. — John Williams.|$|E
25|$|Matt McCoy, {{a senior}} walk-on, {{is a young}} man that has been working for {{the last three or four}} years. We would {{certainly}} not take a redshirt off Sherrod Harris at this point; it would be unfair for him because he has sat this year with the idea that he'll start the spring as a redshirt freshman. And then Mack (Brown) and I will sit down and discuss the possibility of an emergency situation as we've done in the past; one year Tony Jeffrey worked as quarterback for us because he had played quarterback in high school. So we'll sit down and look at some different options as to which way we would go. It would certainly be <b>somebody</b> <b>that</b> we think can run the offense and have a limited package for those guys. I don't think we'll need an emergency quarterback, but we'll certainly have a third guy ready.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to <b>somebody</b> <b>that</b> {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed the door.|$|E

500|$|Wilford Brimley {{was cast}} {{at the urging}} of his good friend Duvall, who was not getting along well with Beresford and wanted [...] "somebody down here that's on my side, <b>somebody</b> <b>that</b> I can relate to".

500|$|Explaining {{his choice}} of label, Thornton said, [...] "I chose to go with <b>somebody</b> <b>that</b> [...] take this as a {{creative}} project, not a marketing project. Major labels tend to let inexperienced people oversee your projects. Your innovation goes down because they have [...] input. You don't see anybody going into the studio to tell James Brown what to do. Even though he can adapt to certain things, nobody tells him how to sing. That's the way I feel about myself." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2013, Norwood told Amy Duncan from Metro {{that the}} {{relationship}} with Poppy was [...] "needed for Fatboy" [...] as he had so far been unlucky in love and [...] "to find <b>somebody</b> <b>that</b> liked {{him as much as}} he liked her has been a great boost for him and it's definitely put an extra spring in his step."

500|$|It can {{be argued}} {{that this is not a}} true {{exception}} to the doctrine because once the contract is made the [...] "agent" [...] plays no further part, leaving it as an agreement between two parties. Certain elements of the doctrine of agency have been said to clash with privity, however. In some circumstances the principal can sue the third party even when the agent has not disclosed to the third party that he is acting as an agent to the principal. In this situation, the third party can be sued by <b>somebody</b> <b>that</b> he had no idea was involved in the contract.|$|E
500|$|Raleigh's {{commanding}} officer. On selecting Elba, del Toro stated: [...] "This is a {{movie where}} I have {{had to deal with}} more dialogue than ever, and the way I cast the movie was—who do I want to hear say these things? Who do I want Charlie Hunnam to go against? Who can really tell Charlie Hunnam 'sit down and listen'?" [...] In another interview, the director said: [...] "I wanted to have Idris not be the blonde, square-jawed, Anglo, super hip marine that knows [...] I wanted <b>somebody</b> <b>that</b> could bring a lot of authority, but that you could feel {{the weight of the world}} on his shoulders. When I watched Luther, that's the essence of the character… Luther is carrying literally the evils of the world on his shoulders. He's doing penance for all humanity… Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a Rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes. I wanted <b>somebody</b> <b>that</b> you could have doubts internally, and very few guys can do that." [...] To prepare for the role, Elba watched footage of politicians David Cameron and Barack Obama, as well as Russell Crowe in Gladiator and Mel Gibson in Braveheart. Del Toro initially offered the role to Tom Cruise, who declined because of scheduling conflicts.|$|E
500|$|... "Beside You", {{the second}} {{song on the}} album, has been {{described}} as [...] "expressionistic poetry and a scattershot collection of images and scenarios". [...] It begins with the classical guitar of Jay Berliner and Morrison's voice circling each other. Morrison described it as [...] "the kind of song that you'd sing to a kid or <b>somebody</b> <b>that</b> you love. [...] It's basically a love song. It's just a song about being spiritually beside somebody." [...] It was originally recorded for Bang Records in December 1967. That first recording shows the pop music intentions of Bert Berns which give it a different sound from the Astral Weeks recording.|$|E

500|$|Drummer Sherman Ferguson said of Ibn Ali, [...] "he was a {{prime example}} of <b>somebody</b> <b>that</b> was very avant-garde in some ways, but he was always musical. So people of all ages liked his music, even when he played out. [...] had that thing, where he had a natural feeling. He got to the thing where it swung no matter what he was doing." [...] Saxophonist Benny Golson commented that Ibn Ali [...] "became very skilled at the modern sounds, and then went right past them into {{something}} very esoteric. He went way out there. I guess you could say his brakes didn't work." ...|$|E
500|$|... "What a video!" [...] Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody enthused to Q. [...] "I {{have become}} obsessed with it {{and not just because}} I'm in love with Kimbra. Gotye himself is an {{engaging}} character for sure... his solemnly expressive eyes finish a journey his lyrics only begin. 'Told myself that you were right for me but felt so lonely in your company' – simple, pure, and devastating. None more than the title line when it speaks of the end of love with prosaic brutality: 'Now you're just <b>somebody</b> <b>that</b> I used to know.' Great video, powerful lyrics, and a stunning voice. Oh, and Kimbra... my poor heart..." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{this point}} in time, [...] Morrison was under {{pressure}} by Warner Bros. Records to produce chart singles and two albums within a year. [...] His previous album, His Band and the Street Choir, had been released in November 1970. [...] In an interview with journalist Sean O'Hagan in 1990, he described this period as being {{in contrast to the}} laid back atmosphere pictured on the album cover: [...] "When I went to the West Coast these people [...] weren't that available so I had to virtually put a completely new band together overnight to do [...] So it was a very tough period. I didn't want to change my band but if I wanted to get into the studio I had to ring up and get <b>somebody.</b> <b>That</b> was the predicament I was in." ...|$|E

500|$|In February 2011, Isaacs {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Michael Britten, the central {{character}} of the series. Gordon summarized the character: [...] "He's a guy who goes to sleep, wakes up, he's with his wife, goes to sleep, wakes up, and he's with his son. [...] And so—and he's a cop who sees clues and details that crossover from one world to the next, and he uses that insight to solve crimes." [...] " [...] was <b>somebody</b> <b>that</b> you couldn't decide if you liked or hated, and I think that 's dilemma is something that we're not only sympathetic for, but somehow we want him to win." [...] Producers of the show initially approached Michaela McManus to play Hannah Britten. However, Laura Allen {{was cast in}}stead; McManus obtained the role of Tara (for which Allen originally auditioned).|$|E
500|$|Initial discussions {{took place}} in 2008 between Tom Cruise and Noyce about Cruise playing Edwin A. Salt. These discussions were ongoing {{for more than a}} year between the pair and their representatives. It was finally decided that Cruise was unable to commit to the script, because he feared that the {{character}} was too close to his [...] character Ethan Hunt. Cruise decided to work on [...] Knight and Day instead. The filmmakers tried to differentiate the character from Hunt, but eventually came to accept they were too similar and decided not to change the characteristics of Salt. Noyce said [...] "But, you know, he had a valid point. It was kind of returning to an offshoot of a character that he’d already played. It’s like playing the brother, or the cousin, of <b>somebody</b> <b>that</b> you played in another movie".|$|E

Nolan has stated that, {{due to the}} eight-year gap between The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises, [...] "he's an older Bruce Wayne; he's not in a great state." [...] Bale employed a martial arts discipline called the Keysi Fighting Method, now modified for Bruce's current state and Bane's style. Bale has stated that The Dark Knight Rises will be his final Batman film. Bale acknowledged that Batman is [...] "not a healthy individual, this is <b>somebody</b> <b>that</b> is doing good, but he's right {{on the verge of}} doing bad". Bale clarifies that [...] "He doesn't want to forget [...] He wants to maintain that anger he felt at that injustice". Bale felt bittersweet about leaving the franchise, saying that it was like [...] "saying goodbye to an old friend." ...|$|E
