25|$|The G-14 {{arrived in}} July 1944 at the {{invasion}} front over France. It represented {{an attempt to}} create a standard type, incorporating many changes which had been introduced during production of the G-6, and which led to a plethora of variants, plaguing decentralized mass production. The standardization attempt proved to be a failure, but overall the type offered improved combat performance, as MW 50 power boosting water injection (increasing output to 1,800PS (1,775hp, 1,324kW), the clear-view Erla Haube was now <b>standard</b> <b>installation.</b> Top speed was 568km/h (353mph) at sea level, and 665km/h (413mph) at 5km (16,400ft) altitude. A high-altitude fighter, designated G-14/AS was also produced with the DB 605ASM high-altitude engine. The ASM engine was built with a larger capacity supercharger, and had a higher rated altitude, and correspondingly the top speed of the G-14/AS was 560km/h (348mph) at sea level, and 680km/h (422mph) at 7.5km (24,600ft) altitude.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In August 2000, a {{concrete}} pipe culvert of 1370 mm inside diameter was installed under a truck route {{in the former}} Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton (now City of Ottawa) using the <b>Standard</b> <b>Installations</b> method. The project demonstrated two installation conditions, known as Type 2 and Type 3. In order to evaluate the pipe performance and verify the <b>Standard</b> <b>Installations</b> theory, two (2) pipe sections were instrumented to evaluate the loading conditions and enable {{a comparison of the}} <b>Standard</b> <b>Installations</b> theory. The performance monitoring conducted over a three-year period showed good correlation with the <b>Standard</b> <b>Installations</b> theory. The measured performance of the pipe from the test site compared to the predicted performance for <b>Standard</b> <b>Installations</b> has resulted in some very informative findings on the interaction between pipe and soil, and provides the owners of infrastructure with design options for concrete pipe. This research offers a cost effective alternative to the current design method developed more than seventy years ago. 1...|$|R
