60|$|Alice {{considered}} a little. 'I like birthday presents best,' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last.</b>|$|E
60|$|Anne was embarrassed, and {{her smile}} was uncomfortable. 'I shall not tell you,' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last.</b>|$|E
60|$|Her lips moved, but {{the promise}} was not articulated. 'O, sir, I cannot promise it!' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dame. Certainly I can — I'll tell thee, Tummas, what <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> church <b>last</b> Sunday.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> {{relieving}} <b>at</b> <b>last</b> with {{a significant}} smile the solemnity of our immediate greeting, [...] "and the great Madonna? Have you seen her, after all?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She gave {{herself to}} him in her silence more than she could have done in words. [...] "Have you {{arranged}} it with mamma?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> however, <b>at</b> <b>last.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{extraordinary}} {{to think}} of sexual selection," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> looking up from her contemplation of the miraculous feather.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is there?' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> {{with the}} same {{untouched}} calm. And then {{in a tone of}} whimsical inquisitiveness: 'What fruit, Rupert?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I say, Bill,' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> {{to one of}} {{the boys}} who was fielding close beside her, 'that there Blakeston--d'you know 'im?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maurice," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> resolutely <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> [...] "you <b>said</b> {{just now}} that the thief was in {{collusion}} with his friend de Marmont. What {{did you mean by}} that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Here,’ <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> ‘here <b>at</b> <b>last</b> we are {{secure from}} listeners. Here, then, you shall learn and judge my history. I {{could not bear}} that we should part, and that you should still suppose your {{kindness}} squandered upon one who was unworthy.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will you not sit, monsieur?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>at</b> <b>last.</b> She {{was very}} quiet to-day, this little maid--very quiet and very wondrously subdued.|$|R
60|$|Miss Aldclyffe {{reflected}} a moment. 'Don't {{you want to}} tell me who Edward is?' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> in a tone of meaning.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jane Merrick is your father's sister," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> as she thoughtfully {{folded the}} letter and placed it upon the table.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is all for to-day,' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> 'but I {{will come}} again to-morrow,' and biding him good-bye {{she went down}} the path.|$|E
6000|$|... "Messer Gonzaga," [...] <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> [...] "I'll {{not deny}} that you served me {{faithfully}} {{in the matter of}} my escape from Urbino----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There <b>she</b> is,' I <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last.</b> But her new position, and {{the course}} she was now lying, puzzled me. 'They cannot mean to beat to sea,' I cried.|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> {{trying to}} draw her pretty brows {{together}} into a frown, [...] "tell me; why didst thou seek to climb the wall?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Hilary," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> [...] "are you {{satisfied}} about the girl--I mean, are {{you satisfied}} that she really is worth helping?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Clavering!" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> {{and there}} was much more of {{surprise}} than of welcome in her words as she uttered them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here's sevenpence," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> {{holding out}} a little pile of copper coins. [...] "I'll give you that and a wicker footstool." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{is in the}} room,' said Violet, looking round for him, hoping {{either that}} he would come, or that Mr. Gardner would go in search of him, but the {{conversation}} continued, though she answered without knowing what <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> till <b>at</b> <b>last</b> he moved away to communicate to Mrs. Finch that Arthur Martindale's pretty wife had nothing but fine eyes and complexion.|$|R
6000|$|... "And so, Monsieur, the Secretary," [...] <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> {{a nervous}} laugh quivering {{in her first}} words, [...] "from all this wondrous verbiage I am to take it that you love?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But why," [...] <b>said</b> <b>she,</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> giving vent to her feelings, [...] "why {{does the}} Government at home not remove such an {{incapable}} and wicked Governor {{and give us}} a better?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> with faltering voice, as she meditated in what words she might best convey her refusal.|$|E
60|$|Elfride hesitated. 'And what {{when she}} has been married?' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> partly in order to {{withdraw}} her own person from the argument.|$|E
6000|$|... "Love," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last.</b> [...] "It {{comes to}} some people. It happens. It happens to young people.... But {{when one is}} married----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{surprised}} to see me here living with my husband, after what I told you yesterday afternoon?" [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> calmly, breaking <b>at</b> <b>last</b> the silence which had reigned between them.|$|R
6000|$|Little Pauline {{stood looking}} seriously {{at him for}} a while. [...] "I am sorry for thee, Otto," [...] <b>said</b> <b>she,</b> <b>at</b> <b>last.</b> And then, <b>at</b> her childish pity, he began crying in earnest.|$|R
6000|$|Marcia gasped, as if {{she felt}} the clutch in which her husband had her {{tightening}} on her heart. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> could only carry her point against him {{at the cost of}} disgraceful division before the Hallecks, for which he would not care in the least. She moved her head a little from side to side, like one that breathes a stifling air. [...] "Oh, let her come," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> quietly, <b>at</b> <b>last.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Catherine had {{to admit}} this, and she did so in silence. [...] "I don't believe Mr. Townsend himself likes it," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{think he}} has an {{extraordinarily}} good face,' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last</b> gravely. 'I've never seen a man whose honesty of purpose was so transparent.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yer {{dirty little}} bitch, you!' <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>at</b> <b>last.</b> 'Tike that!' {{and with her}} open hand she gave her a sharp smack on the cheek.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish you'd {{take those}} {{drawings}} down, Philip," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said</b> to him <b>at</b> <b>last.</b> [...] "Mrs. Foreman, of number thirteen, came in yesterday afternoon, and I didn't {{know which way}} to look. I saw her staring at them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>at</b> <b>last,</b> {{trying to}} recover herself; [...] "this is a {{circumstance}} which I must think of {{at least half a}} day, before I can at all comprehend it. What!--engaged to her all the winter--before either of them came to Highbury?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here," [...] <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "here <b>at</b> <b>last</b> we are {{secure from}} listeners. Here, then, you shall learn and judge my history. I {{could not bear}} that we should part, and that you should still suppose your {{kindness}} squandered upon one who was unworthy." ...|$|R
