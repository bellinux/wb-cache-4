During this period, his long time {{secretary}} Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack, his wife Kasturba died after 18 months' imprisonment on 22 February 1944; and Gandhi suffered a severe malaria attack. While in Jail, he agreed to an interview with Stuart Gelder, a British journalist. Gelder then composed and released an interview summary, cabled it to the mainstream press, that announced sudden concessions Gandhi was willing to make, comments that shocked his countrymen, the Congress workers and even Gandhi. The latter two claimed that it distorted what Gandhi actually <b>said</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> range of topics and falsely repudiated the Quit India movement.|$|E
5|$|The 1961 {{season was}} typical on the field: Jim Brown {{led the league}} in rushing for the fifth {{straight}} season and the team ended with an 8–5–1 record. That left Cleveland two games out of a berth in the championship. During that year, however, players began to question Paul Brown's strict and often overbearing demeanor, while many challenged his control over the team's strategy. Milt Plum spoke out against Brown calling all the team's offensive plays, and Jim Brown <b>said</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> weekly radio broadcast that the coach's play-calling and handling of Plum were undermining the quarterback's confidence. They found a willing listener in Modell, a bachelor who was closer to their age than the coach's.|$|E

However, according to Michaels' account of the events in his 2005 autobiography, Heartbreak and Triumph: The Shawn Michaels Story, Michaels himself informed Hebner of the plan only on Sunday evening, just as Survivor Series was about to commence. This contradicted what Hebner <b>said</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> 2003 edition of WWE Confidential, claiming that he first knew of McMahon's plan only ten minutes before the match finished, and out of panic following the bell ringing, he ran out of the ring, through the crowd and remained in his hotel room for the night, refusing to speak to anyone.|$|E

While saying the group would assemble to record new material, Lee announced the release of The Open Door to her fans during a post on an unofficial Evanescence website, EvBoard.com.

At the time MLSE was considering bringing a NFL team to Toronto permanently and building them a new stadium, but abandoned the idea when they concluded that the project would not generate sufficient financial return to justify the significant cost of the project. Subsequently, MLSE president Tim Leiweke <b>said</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> NFL team in Toronto: [...] "We can't own a team (per NFL rules), but we do have more expertise on how to build (stadiums) than anyone...

2500|$|One of {{the most}} memorable aspects of the show that was {{developed}} during the first season was the transformation sequence that changed Diana Prince into her superheroine alter ego. [...] The sequence in the original specials employed a slow fade between two synchronized shots, both filmed with an overcranked camera to create a slow motion effect. A twirling Diana Prince's hair would fall loose as the shot transitioned to a twirling Wonder Woman holding her Diana clothes, which she would stow nearby in a closet or locker. (How she changes back to Diana is never shown, although presumably she must return to the location to retrieve her clothes.) To ensure both segments transitioned smoothly the camera was locked off (secured in place) while Carter's clothing, make-up, and hair was altered between identities, a process Carter <b>said</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> DVD commentary typically took about 45 minutes. The spinning transformation was later incorporated into the comics and into animated appearances such as Justice League Unlimited.

She also plays with pronunciations, which she <b>said</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> NPR interview to be a remnant of her early years when she listened to pop in English without understanding the lyrics.

2500|$|The Gemara {{taught that}} the early {{scholars}} were called soferim (related to the original sense of its root safar, [...] "to count") because they used to count all {{the letters of the}} Torah (to ensure the correctness of the text).
