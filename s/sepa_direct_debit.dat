40|$|In {{the recent}} years payment systems in Europe are evolved {{to a new}} {{scenario}} where transactions and retail payments take place according to the SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) Regulation. SEPA is an initiative of the European banking industry aiming at making all electronic payments across the Euro area-e. g. by credit card, debit card, bank transfer or direct debit-As easy as domestic payments currently are. One of the payment schemes defined by the SEPA mandate is the <b>SEPA</b> <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> (SDD) that allows a creditor (biller) to collect funds from a debtor's (payer's) account, provided that a signed mandate has been granted by the payer to the biller. Thanks to SDD consumers can make and receive no-cash euro payments with a single set of instructions and a single bank account. It is apparent {{that the use of}} this standard scheme facilitates the access to new markets by enterprises and public administrations and allows for a substantial cost reduction. However, {{the other side of the}} coin is represented by the security issues concerning this type of electronic payments. A study conducted by Center of Economics and Business Research (CEBR) of Britain, on behalf of Liverpool Insurance Company, showed that from 2006 to 2010 the Direct Debit frauds have increased of 288 %. In this paper a comprehensive analysis of real SDD data provided by the EU FP 7 LeanBigData project is performed in order to identify and classify emerging and sophisticated attack patterns that can be executed against an SDD service. The results of this data analysis will be used to inspire the design of a security system supporting analysts to detect Direct Debit frauds...|$|E
40|$|SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) {{is a new}} step in {{the move}} towards {{financial}} integration in Europe. SEPA will harmonise the use of payment instruments (credit transfers, direct debits and card payments) throughout SEPA (the 27 EU countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland). All the economic actors {{will be able to}} make cross-border euro payments in the same way as domestic euro payments, with the same obligations and liabilities. The European Commission has created a harmonised legal framework for payment services and the European Payments Council (EPC), unifying the banking sector, directs the process under a self-regulating regime. The Eurosystem monitors progress and developments in its catalyst role. For each of the SEPA payment instruments, the EPC has developed standards : “Rulebooks” for the credit transfer and direct debit payment instruments and a more general framework for card payments. Ultimately, the same credit transfer and direct debit payment instruments will be available and accessible to all users. Any SEPA payment cards will be accepted at any terminal in SEPA. Infrastructures will have to be adapted to meet the new payment standards, and consolidation is likely. SEPA is being created in phases. The design phase is now finished and from January 2008 onwards banks will offer their customers the SEPA Credit Transfer in parallel with the existing national credit transfer. The <b>SEPA</b> <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> will be launched in November 2009. By the end of 2010, the use of the national payment instruments should cease. For cards, banks will need up to the end of 2010 to streamline all standards. From 2011 onwards, only SEPA cards will be issued. In Belgium, the SEPA project is organised on two different levels : from a banking perspective and on a more general level with all stakeholders in the economy. A migration plan has been published and is regularly updated. Thanks to its long tradition of interbank cooperation, the Belgian banking sector is one of the leading banking communities in the migration to SEPA in Europe.

40|$|Research {{objectives}} and methods This thesis studies {{the effects of}} SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) on Finnish companies. SEPA is a project of the 27 EU member countries and five other European countries. With SEPA all euro payments will be treated as domestic payments, and the current differentiation between national and cross-border payments will cease. SEPA will bring benefits to companies, {{but they also have}} to make some changes in order to become SEPA compliant. The research objective is to find out how companies are preparing for SEPA and if SEPA is an opportunity for companies to reengineer their payment processes. The thesis includes a literature review of business process reengineering (BPR) as well as an empirical research of SEPA in Finnish companies. Cases study research method is used for the research, in which five major Finnish companies and one SME are interviewed. Though the main scope of the research is major companies, one SME was also interviewed to be able to compare SEPA effects in small and large companies. Findings of the research The findings of the research were that the companies thought SEPA offered possibilities for gaining benefits through reengineering payment processes. Most of the companies interviewed had though already started to centralize their payments handling and therefore had no need for further BPR because of SEPA. In several interviewed companies payments were centralized to a shared service center. The interviewed major companies usually had had a SEPA project, in which the required SEPA changes to their ERPs were done. Those companies saw SEPA at the moment as an IT project, but also thought that in the future the benefits of SEPA (e. g. centralization of payments and cash collection, consolidating banking connections) could be realized. In the SME interviewed SEPA did not require great changes, and they thought SEPA was something that IT providers should take care of and not companies. SEPA credit transfer was the only SEPA payment instrument all interviewed companies were going to start using, as for example <b>SEPA</b> <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> was only going to be used in one company...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays the {{enterprise}} architecture (EA) presents {{the foundation for}} a successful management of complex business systems, of which also the bank information systems are a part of. The concepts of business and IT architectures in banking IT systems are a novelty in Slovenia, as well as in other countries. In order to manage their business systems and reduce system costs, banks will have to begin laying foundations represented by the business IT architecture. One of the new areas constantly expanding in banking is the SEPA area. A part of the SEPA area is represented by the <b>SEPA</b> <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> (SDD). The SDD orders are a payment service, in which the payee orders a payment transaction to be debited to their account {{on the basis of a}} predetermined consensus with the payer. This area of processing is not limited to the national level and is uniform in the entire SEPA EU area. The introductory part of the thesis presents a brief insight into the EA methodology and describes various aspects and perspectives of the researched field. Also, a detailed description of the methodology and the framework ArchiMate is included, with which the case study in the field of SEPA direct debits was carried out. Briefly, a possible integration of the designed models with the models of business process modelling (BPMN) and UML is discussed. In the last part of the thesis, the variety of EA models designed especially for this particular field is presented. The actors have been analyzed and consequently the business-IT architecture has begun to show its shape. The models have been applied to the three areas of the used methodology: business, application and technology. During the modelling stage, the basis for further extensions to other areas of business have been laid. The models were modelled in the tool Archi and the framework ArchiMate, the latter being the most modern at this moment. With the constructed case study and the concept presentation we confirmed the complexity of the field, and that the designed models are not an end in themselves, but help showcase different aspects to individual actors, and enable them to be aware of their impact on the business. The designed models allow the bank to react more quickly to the market changes, they especially enhance their ability to affect the changes in the current situation. Application-wise, the developed models can serve as a tool, with which the existing banking IT systems may be analyzed in terms of their efficiency. Also, the analytical technique is described, and suggestions for a more effective and simpler IT system are provided. With the developed models we built concept that can serve as a basis for an extension to the entire banking system. ...|$|E
