25|$|The Juhu airport {{redevelopment}} plan, {{that received}} an in-principle nod from the State Government on 5 April 2013, involves closing down its <b>secondary</b> <b>runway</b> 16/34. Aviation experts {{have called the}} re-development blueprint most unsafe as closing of the <b>secondary</b> <b>runway</b> at Juhu would mean the airport would have to shut operations whenever CSIA uses its <b>secondary</b> <b>runway</b> 14/32. The use of Juhu's main runway while CSIA's <b>secondary</b> <b>runway</b> is in use will cause aircraft paths to intersect risking air safety. Airlines would be averse to operating from an airport which would either violate safety norms or be shut almost 40% of the time.|$|E
25|$|With a {{new airport}} under consideration, {{the project for}} a {{parallel}} runway {{has been put on}} hold and the total land required for the airport expansion reduced from 1,069.99 acres to 800 acres. AAI planned to operate 2,400m even after removing obstructions. About 2,085m of the runway was earlier used for landing only smaller aircraft, like ATR types. In February 2012, airport authorities announced that only about 2,160m of the <b>secondary</b> <b>runway</b> would be operational as there will be 330m permanent displacement at GST road side and 780m displacement at the other end. This restricted length would be enough to operate Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 aircraft without load penalty. Bad planning by the airport authorities, which has resulted in the removal of the very-high-frequency omni range equipment (VOR) from its original location where a link way has been constructed between the main and the secondary runways, has been considered the reason behind the delay.|$|E

[...] In addition to the main airfield, several auxiliary airfields were constructed to support the training mission: ...|$|R
500|$|The {{aircraft}} was assigned the airport's Runway 22 for the takeoff, but used Runway 26 instead. Analysis {{of the cockpit}} voice recorder (CVR) indicated the {{aircraft was}} cleared to take off from Runway 22, a [...] strip used by most airline traffic at Lexington. Instead, after confirming [...] "Runway two-two", Captain Jeffrey Clay taxied onto Runway 26, an unlit <b>secondary</b> <b>runway</b> only [...] long, and turned the controls over to First Officer James Polehinke for takeoff. The air traffic controller was not required to maintain visual contact with the aircraft; after clearing the aircraft for takeoff, he turned to perform administrative duties and {{did not see the}} aircraft taxi to the runway.|$|E
500|$|During {{the heavy}} fighting, {{portions}} of three Japanese companies, including two from Tamura's {{and one from}} Watanabe's battalions, skirted the Marine defenses on the ridge, while suffering heavy losses from Marine gunfire, and reached the edge of [...] "Fighter One", a <b>secondary</b> <b>runway</b> of Henderson Field. A counterattack by the Marine engineers stopped one Japanese company's advances and forced it to retreat. The other two companies waited {{at the edge of}} the jungle for reinforcements to arrive before attacking into the open area around the airfield. [...] When no reinforcements joined them, both companies went back to their original positions south of the ridge after daybreak. Most of the rest of Watanabe's battalion did not participate in the battle because they lost contact with their commander during the night.|$|E

50|$|Halesworth {{was built}} in 1942 - 1943 and was {{intended}} {{for use as a}} bomber station, and was built as such with a 6,000 ft. main <b>runway</b> and two <b>secondary</b> <b>runways</b> of 4,200 ft length. There was an encircling perimeter track with 51 hardstands and two T-2 hangars. Nissen hut accommodations for about 3,000 personnel were also built south of the airfield.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>secondary</b> <b>runway,</b> {{which was}} {{initially}} 2,035 m long, was closed in 2009 to extend {{it over the}} Adyar river {{by means of a}} bridge over the watercourse at a cost of [...] 430 crore. Initially, 126.59 acres of land for second runway was handed over to Airports Authority of India (AAI). In March 2011, by acquiring 136 acres of land from the state government, AAI completed extension of the 2,035 m <b>secondary</b> <b>runway</b> by 1,400m, whose commissioning, initially planned to be by November 2011, has been delayed as the approach lighting system has not been installed. While the cost of extending the runway was projected to be about [...] 240 crore, that of the bridge is almost [...] 230 crore. A bridge has been constructed across the Adyar river to extend the <b>secondary</b> <b>runway</b> by a length of 1,400m to a total length of 3,445m, including 835m on the northern side of the river. The bridge accommodates the runway and a taxiway, making Chennai Airport the only international airport in India to have a runway across a river. In Mumbai, only an end of the runway is over Mithi river. When the Airports Authority of India (AAI) recommissions the <b>secondary</b> <b>runway,</b> Chennai airport will join the league of airports with a functional runway across a river.|$|E
