40|$|Purpose: Perfusion {{assessment}} during <b>septic</b> shock <b>resuscitation</b> {{is difficult}} and usually complex determinations. Capillary refill time (CRT) and central-to-toe temperature difference (Tc-toe) have been proposed as objective reproducible parameters to evaluate peripheral perfusion. The comparative evolution of peripheral vs metabolic perfusion parameters in <b>septic</b> shock <b>resuscitation</b> has not been studied. We conducted a prospective observational clinical-physiologic study to address this subject. Methods: Patients with sepsis-related circulatory dysfunction were resuscitated according to a standard local algorithm. Perfusion assessment included serial determinations of metabolic (central venous O- 2 saturation [ScvO(2) ] and central venous to arterial PCO 2 gradient [P(cv-a) CO 2]) and peripheral perfusion parameters (CRT and Tc-toe, among others). Successful resuscitation {{was defined as a}} normal plasma lactate at 24 hours. Results: Forty-one patients were included. The presence of normal values for both CRT and Tc-toe considered together at 6 hours was independently associated with a successful resuscitation (P =. 02), as compared with the behavior of metabolic parameters. Capillary refill time was the first parameter to be significantly normalized. Conclusion: Early recovery of peripheral perfusion anticipates a successful resuscitation compared with traditional metabolic parameters in septic shock patients.

30|$|Treatments for sepsis shock in {{hemodynamics}} involve three aspects: macrocirculation, microcirculation, {{and cellular}} metabolism. In many cases, when macrocirculation indexes including cardiac output {{and blood pressure}} recover to normal values, tissue hypoxia persists [6]. This may be the reason for incoherence between the macrocirculation and microcirculation [7]. The goal of correcting macrocirculation through fluid resuscitation, vasoactive drug infusion, and cardiac inotrope infusion is to improve microcirculation. However, sometimes after <b>septic</b> shock <b>resuscitation,</b> no obvious improvements were observed in microvascular blood flow because of the increased flow heterogeneity with sepsis [8]. Other than macrocirculation, and although microcirculation and cell function can influence each other, it is reported that treatment aimed at the microcirculation {{may be more important}} in <b>septic</b> shock <b>resuscitation</b> [9]. Additionally, microcirculation dysfunction may occur earlier than mitochondria dysfunction in endotoxemia [10]. These findings support the importance of microcirculation dysfunction in sepsis shock [2, 3]. Therefore, correcting microcirculation dysfunction is a key aspect in sepsis shock resuscitation.|$|R

30|$|Introduction: Persistent hyperlactatemia {{after initial}} <b>septic</b> shock <b>resuscitation</b> is {{associated}} with bad prognosis. However, at least three mechanisms are involved: anaerobic glycolysis in hypoperfused tissues, adrenergic-driven aerobic glycolysis and impaired lactate clearance.

30|$|In this review, we {{will expand}} {{on the concept}} of the “four D’s” of fluid therapy (drug, duration, dosing and de-escalation). We will also focus on the recent concept {{defining}} four different phases in the time course of <b>septic</b> shock (<b>resuscitation,</b> optimization, stabilization and evacuation). Each phase requires a different therapeutic attitude regarding fluid administration. Taking into account both of these concepts in combination with other suggested ideas may promote more rational fluid administration aimed at avoiding both too little and too much.

Unfortunately, neither this new definition [1], or the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) [2] recognizes the heterogeneous sources of lactate in septic shock or the existence of different clinical patterns among hyperlactatemic patients.

30|$|The {{decision}} of {{when to stop}} <b>septic</b> shock <b>resuscitation</b> is a critical but yet a relatively unexplored aspect of care. This is especially relevant since the risks of over-resuscitation with fluid overload or inotropes have been highlighted in recent years. A recent guideline has proposed normalization of central venous oxygen saturation and/or lactate as therapeutic end-points, assuming that these variables are equivalent or interchangeable. However, since the physiological determinants of both are totally different, it is legitimate to challenge the rationale of this proposal. We designed this study to gain more insights into the most appropriate resuscitation goal from a dynamic point of view.

40|$|AbstractSevere sepsis and {{septic shock}} {{represent}} a major healthcare challenge.

High-fidelity simulation-based training is a new teaching technology in our faculty which may improve the performance of medical students in the resuscitation process. However, since the efficacy of this training method in our institute is limited, we organized an extra class for this evaluation. Purpose: The aim was to evaluate the effect on medical students’ knowledge and confidence levels after the high-fidelity medical simulation training in septic shock management. Methods: A retrospective study was performed in sixth year medical students during an internal medicine rotation between November 2015 and March 2016. The simulation class was a 2 -hour session of a septic shock management scenario and post-training debriefing. Knowledge assessment was determined by a five-question pre-test and post-test examination. At the end of the class, the students completed their confidence evaluation questionnaire. Results: Of the 79 medical students, the mean percentage score ± standard deviation (SD) of the post-test examination was statistically significantly higher than the pre-test (66. 83 %± 19. 7 % vs 47. 59 %± 19. 7 %, p< 0. 001). In addition, the student mean percentage confidence level ± SD in management of septic shock was significantly better after the simulation class (68. 10 %± 12. 2 % vs 51. 64 %± 13. 1 %, p< 0. 001).

30|$|The {{physiologic}} {{basis of}} lactate generation during shock has been matter of debate and research [7 – 11]. Hypovolemia-related hypoperfusion {{is probably the}} predominant pathogenic mechanism during the early pre-resuscitative phase. Some patients resolve sepsis-related circulatory dysfunction and clear lactate after initial fluid resuscitation, whereas others evolve into a persistent circulatory dysfunction with hyperlactatemia [12]. Although several potential hypoxic and nonhypoxic mechanisms {{have been associated with}} persistent hyperlactatemia [7 – 14], recent literature has highlighted the role of microcirculatory abnormalities [14] or hyperadrenergia [10, 11, 13] as the most likely determinants. This has occurred in parallel to a decline in the availability of gastric tonometry precluding clinicians to assess hepatosplanchnic perfusion in this setting. More importantly, the relative contribution of several potential factors to persistent hyperlactatemia after initial <b>septic</b> shock <b>resuscitation</b> has not been specifically addressed in comprehensive, clinical, physiological studies.|$|R
30|$|Sepsis is a well-recognized {{worldwide}} healthcare issue, ultimately {{resulting in}} significant mortality [1], morbidity and resource utilization {{during and after}} critical illness [2]. Initial consensus definitions relied upon the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) to infection as a fundamental aspect of sepsis definition, which was then stratified in severity {{according to the presence}} of organ dysfunction (severe sepsis) or vasopressor requirement despite adequate fluid <b>resuscitation</b> (<b>septic</b> shock) [3]. This had an important role in education and the pathophysiological understanding of the transition between a homeostatic and a dys-homeostatic inflammatory response that results in organ dysfunctions.|$|R
30|$|In {{the present}} study, sublingual microcirculatory {{variables}} exhibited the slowest recovery rate. Moreover, since concomitant clinical and metabolic perfusion variables were already normal {{in the great}} majority of our patients, it appears as highly unlikely that persistent microcirculatory abnormalities may respond to additional fluids or DO 2 optimization maneuvers after 24 h of resuscitation. In fact, fluid loading after 48 h of sepsis failed to improve microcirculatory derangements in a recent report [31]. The time-course of microcirculatory recovery during <b>septic</b> shock <b>resuscitation</b> may also follow a biphasic pattern with an early apparently flow-responsive phase [32],[33]. However, further improvements appear to be much slower with full recovery taking several days [8],[34]. The recovery slope of StO 2 after a VOT maneuver was moderately abnormal in all patients, and like microcirculatory derangements, it showed a very slow recovery trend without significant improvement at 24 h. Taken together, our current and previous data suggest that persistent microcirculatory abnormalities after 24 h of resuscitation may represent different pathogenic mechanisms not responsive to DO 2 increasing maneuvers.|$|R
30|$|How can we conceptualize our results? The {{critical}} {{decision to}} stop resuscitation {{is complex and}} should probably be taken after a multimodal perfusion assessment has been performed. The normalization of some variables such as ScvO 2, lactate, or CRT is clearly a good signal, but eventually their normalization trend {{is more important than}} absolute values at certain periods. In practical terms, resuscitation would have been stopped at admission in 90 % of these patients by using the single criterion of a normal ScvO 2 but only in 52 % of patients at 24 h by using a normal lactate criterion. Our study was not designed to establish which criterion is better, but it does suggest that the length of <b>septic</b> shock <b>resuscitation</b> may vary dramatically depending on the selected perfusion goal and that the different potential targets are not equivalent or interchangeable as suggested by a recent guideline [4]. Since ours is only a hypothesis-generating study, these findings should be explored and confirmed in future studies, since as mentioned before an excess in resuscitation efforts may lead to severe side effects.|$|R

We conducted an observational study in septic shock patients undergoing resuscitation. Serial clinical, hemodynamic, and perfusion parameters were registered.

40|$|In {{the whole}} world, around 29, 000 {{children}} younger than 5 years die every day, and sepsis {{is the most common}} cause of death. Whereas in adult patients vasomotor paralysis represents the predominant cause of mortality, death in pediatric sepsis is associated with severe hypovolemia and low cardiac output. The purpose of this article was to review the recent evidence on early treatment of pediatric severe sepsis and septic shock. Although current American College of Critical Care Medicine-Pediatric Advanced Life Support guidelines represent best practice, stronger evidences are lacking to confirm the components of these recommendations. Retrospective studies showed, at the same time, the positive effects arising from the utilization of American College of Critical Care Medicine-Pediatric Advanced Life Support guidelines and the existing barriers to its implementation. And one randomized control trial paralleled the results observed in adult patients and revealed that early goal-directed therapy in children is one of the few therapeutic interventions that proved to be beneficial in septic shock treatment.

30|$|In animal {{models of}} <b>septic</b> shock, fluid <b>resuscitation</b> {{resulted}} in modest improvements {{in a number}} of physiological variables. The most consistent finding from large animal models of sepsis is that of a short-term improvement in cardiac output associated with fluid resuscitation, with the effect dissipating rapidly after the termination of infusion [72 – 74]. Similarly, {{a number of studies have}} demonstrated modest improvements in gastrointestinal perfusion with fluid resuscitation [73]; however, this finding is not consistent in all the animal studies [74]. These results support the observation that, although gastrointestinal mucosal blood flow is impaired in septic shock, treatment strategies specifically aimed at improving gastrointestinal perfusion such as fluid resuscitation have generally failed to correct mucosal perfusion abnormalities and failed to show improve important clinical endpoints [75].|$|R
30|$|The {{most recent}} {{clinical}} trial {{to address this}} issue was the ALBIOS trial [9] comparing 20 % albumin to crystalloid in <b>septic</b> patient <b>resuscitation.</b> One thousand eight hundred patients with severe sepsis and septic shock were treated with either albumin and crystalloids, or crystalloids alone for 7  days (1 : 1 distribution). This trial showed that albumin-treated patients had significantly higher serum albumin level and had higher mean arterial pressure. However, these markers did not result in differences in mortality at 28 or 90  days. These data suggest that achieving higher perfusion pressures and oncotic goals does not equate improving survival. A post hoc subgroup analysis which looked at septic shock patients (> 1, 100 of the 1, 800) showed that albumin-treated patients with septic shock did demonstrate decrease in mortality at 90  days, whereas the albumin-treated group in patients without septic shock had an increased mortality. Since this was a post hoc analysis, it is subject to bias and this data will require follow-up studies. Therefore, although the use of albumin does not portend harm, the evidence for its benefit does not exist, and at this time, the use of albumin in <b>resuscitation</b> of <b>septic</b> patients is not supported by clinical evidence.|$|R

40|$|The mixed venous oxygen {{saturation}} {{is a key}} metabolic parameter to evaluate oxygen metabolism and tissue perfusion under pathologic conditions.

There was a significant correlation between central and mixed venous saturation. However, these parameters were not equivalent. The contribution of the different venous compartments to the mixed venous value, varied following systemic hemodynamic changes generated by resuscitation. Both, decreases and increases of mixed venous saturation were accompanied by significant arterial lactate increments. Thus, high mixed venous values do not rule out tissue disoxia.

30|$|The {{increase}} in VO 2 /TNa+ following LPS and fluid resuscitation without APC could either indicate less efficient oxygen use for ATP production for Na+ reabsorption or that oxygen {{is used for}} other purposes than ATP production such as ROS generation. In a recently published review [34], we described that ischemia/reperfusion injury, also arises during hypotensive (<b>septic)</b> shock and <b>resuscitation,</b> is associated with intrarenal microcirculatory dysfunction caused by an imbalance between vasoconstrictors and vasodilators, endothelial damage and endothelium-leukocyte interactions [35 – 37], oxidative stress [38, 39], and oxygen handling [40 – 42]. Alterations in oxygen transport pathways can result in cellular hypoxia and/or dysoxia [33]. This condition is associated with mitochondrial failure and/or activation of alternative pathways for oxygen consumption [34, 43]. This could explain the observed rise in VO 2 /TNa+ here.|$|R
