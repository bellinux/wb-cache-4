40|$|Background—Previous {{attempts}} in heart valve tissue engineering (TE) {{failed to produce}} autologous valve replacements with native-like mechanical behavior to allow for <b>systemic</b> pressure <b>applications.</b> Because hypoxia and insulin are known to promote protein synthesis by adaptive cellular responses, a physiologically relevant oxygen tension and insulin supplements were applied to the growing heart valve tissues to enhance their mechanical properties. Methods and Results—Scaffolds of rapid-degrading polyglycolic acid meshes coated with poly- 4 -hydroxybutyrate were seeded with human saphenous vein myofibroblasts. The tissue-engineered constructs were cultured under normal oxygen tension (normoxia) or hypoxia (7 % O 2) and incubated with or without insulin. Glycosaminoglycan production in the constructs approached that of native values {{under the influence of}} hypoxia and under the influence of insulin. Both insulin and hypoxia were associated with enhanced matrix production and improved mechanical properties; however, a synergistic effect was not observed. Although the amount of collagen and cross-links in the engineered tissues was still lower than that in native adult human aortic valves, constructs cultured under hypoxic conditions reached native human aortic valve levels of tissue strength and stiffness after 4 weeks of culturing. Conclusions—These results indicate that oxygen tension may be a key parameter for the achievement of sufficient tissue quality and mechanical integrity in tissue-engineered heart valves. Engineered tissues of such strength, based on rapid-degrading polymers, have not been achieved to date. These findings bring the potential use of tissue-engineered heart valves for <b>systemic</b> <b>applications</b> a step closer and represent an important improvement in heart valve tissue engineering...|$|R

The latter proposed an effect on water-permeable segments such as the proximal tubule which could fully account for the observed reduction in fractional reabsorption of Na+ up to the early distal tubule (FR-Na+) of 8 % and the increase in early distal tubular Na+ concentration ([Na+]ED) from 35 – 51 [*]mM whereas [K+]ED was left unaltered. In comparison, furosemide (3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. v.), which acts in the water-impermeable thick ascending limb, elicited diuresis, natriuresis and kaliuresis which were associated with a fall in FR-Na+ of 10 % with no change in FR-fluid, and a rise in [Na+]ED from 42 – 117 [*]mM and [K+]ED from 1. 2 – 5. 7 [*]mM with no change in VED.

The results demonstrate that, although the cut-through intersection appears different in layout from the traditional intersection, system constraints are not markedly different. Furthermore, the analyses demonstrated that redistribution of constraints in the cut-through intersection resulted in emergent behaviour which was not anticipated and could prove problematic. Further, based on the lack of understanding of emergent behaviour, similar design induced problems are apparent across both intersections. Specifically, incompatibilities between infrastructure, vehicles and different road users were not dealt with by the proposed design changes. The importance of applying systems methods in the design and evaluation of road transport systems is discussed...|$|R

Cytochromes P 450 (CYPs) consistently reported to be detected in native human skin were also present at the gene level in the ORS-RHE model. The highest Phase I XME gene expression levels were observed for alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenases and (carboxyl) esterases. The model was responsive to the CYP inducers, 3 -methylcholanthrene (3 -MC) and β-naphthoflavone (βNF) after topical and <b>systemic</b> <b>applications,</b> evident at the gene and enzyme activity level. Phase II XME levels were generally {{higher than those of}} Phase I XMEs, the highest levels were GSTs and transferases, including NAT 1. The presence of functional CYPs, UGTs and SULTs was confirmed by incubating the models with 7 -ethoxycoumarin, testosterone, benzo(a) pyrene and 3 -MC, all of which were rapidly metabolized within 24 h after topical application. The extent of metabolism was dependent on saturable and non-saturable metabolism by the XMEs and on the residence time within the model. In conclusion, the ORS-RHE model expresses a number of Phase I and II XMEs, some of which may be induced by AhR ligands.

However, current jet injectors are not designed to maintain shallow dermal penetration depths. Using a new strategy of jet injection, pulsed microjets, we report on delivery of protein drugs into the skin without deep penetration. The high velocity (v > 100 m/s) of microjets allows their entry into the skin, whereas the small jet diameters (50 – 100 μm) and extremely small volumes (2 – 15 nanoliters) limit the penetration depth (≈ 200 μm).

By SE analyzes, it was observed that the pores into the sponges were smaller and numerous as the freezing temperature decreases. However, this temperature did not have any influence on the rehydration speed that was rather influenced by the HEC concentration.

40|$|Parkinsons disease (PD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{neurodegenerative}} movement disorders characterized by a progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Etiological hypotheses include aging, genetic predisposition and environmental factors which lead to mitochondrial impairments in dopaminergic neurons. The pesticide rotenone and the neurotoxin 6 -hydroxy dopamine (6 -OHDA) inhibit the mitochondrial respiratory chain and induce degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Since epidemiological studies suggest a pathogenetic impact of pesticides and chronic <b>systemic</b> <b>applications</b> of low doses of rotenone in rats provoke characteristics of PD, the rotenone rat model was proposed as a new animal model with progressive neurodegeneration to test neuroprotective drug effects. Striatal applications of 6 -OHDA provoke a retrograde degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons. However, to date only acute injections are published. Currently only genetic mice models (no rat models) are available to investigate a combination of genetic predispositions, exogenous factors and aging. This idea prompted us to investigate if chronic systemic administration of rotenone and subchronic intrastriatal microinjections of 6 -OHDA in intact mice reproduce mouse models of PD, which could provide a basis to analyse a combination of genetic and other factors. During the treatment period the effects on vitality and motor behaviour were examined, followed by pathological investigations to assess central (especially degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons) and peripheral alterations. C 57 Bl/ 6 mice at an age of 2. 5, 5 or 12 months were chronically (30 - 45 d) injected with rotenone (2. 5 or 4. 0 - 5. 0 mg/kg s. c.). Rotenone-treated mice exhibited parkinsonian symptoms like a reduced locomotion and even catalepsy; some animals developed a tremor. However, it was not associated with a significant neurodegeneration in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, but with signs of hepatotoxic alterations. Furthermore it was investigated if repeated bilateral intrastriatal applications of 6 -OHDA (8 µg) for 5 or 7 d in C 57 Bl/ 6 mice vs. acute microinjections provoke a retrograde progressive degeneration of nigral neurons. In contrast to an acute application, an administration over 5 d caused a moderate loss of nigral neurons. However, a treatment over 7 d revealed no further aggravation. The data indicate that chronic <b>systemic</b> <b>applications</b> of rotenone in intact mice do not provide a suitable model for PD, because rotenone is not able to cause the neuropathological characteristics. Subchronic intrastriatal injections of 6 -OHDA in mice provoked a moderate degeneration of dopaminergic neurons as described for early stages of PD, nevertheless, because of the absence of a progressive neuronal loss it represents not a suitable animal model to test neuroprotective drug effects.
