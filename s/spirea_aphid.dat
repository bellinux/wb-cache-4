5|$|Aphids: There {{are five}} species of aphids {{commonly}} found on apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, <b>spirea</b> <b>aphid</b> and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species {{can be identified}} by their color, {{the time of year}} when they are present and by differences in the cornicles, which are small paired projections from the rear of aphids. Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.|$|E

50|$|Aphis pomi has a {{widespread}} distribution in Europe, western Asia as far east as India and Pakistan, North Africa and North America. In Israel {{and the eastern}} United States, the more common aphid on apple trees is the <b>spirea</b> <b>aphid,</b> Aphis spiraecola. This has {{a wide range of}} host plants and a faster rate of reproduction than A. pomi, especially at high temperatures.|$|E

50|$|Like {{many species}} of ladybirds, the {{transverse}} ladybird {{plays an important role}} in agriculture as it preys on a wide array of plant-eating insects which damage crops, particularly early in the growing season. Among those insects hunted include {{many species of}} aphids, including the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), Aphis affinis, cowpea aphid (Aphis craccivora), cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii), milkweed aphid (Aphis nerii), <b>spirea</b> <b>aphid</b> (Aphis spiraecola), leafcurling plum aphid (Brachycaudus helichrysi), cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae), Cervaphis quercus, Cervaphis rappardi indica, turnip aphid (Lipaphis pseudobrassicae), Macrosiphoniella yomogifoliae, potato aphid (Macrosiphum euphorbiae), rose aphid (Macrosiphum rosae), Melanaphis donacis, Melanaphis sacchari, Myzus nicotianae, green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), Pentalonia nigronervosa, corn aphid (Rhopalosiphum maidis), Sitobion rosaeiformis, Taoia indica, Toxoptera aurantii, Therioaphis ononidis, Therioaphis trifolii, Uroleucon compositae and Uroleucon sonchi, species of leafhopper including Empoascanara indica and Idioscopus clypealis, the scale insect species Orthezia insignis, the Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri), the cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera), and oriental leafworm moth (Spodoptera litura).|$|E
5000|$|Aphids are {{the main}} vector by which CTV is {{transmit}}ted. Initially the United States only had the melon (cotton aphid) Aphis gossypii, <b>spirea</b> <b>aphid</b> Aphis spiraecola, and black citrus aphid Toxoptera aurantii. [...] These aphids transmit the virus much less efficiently than the brown citrus aphid Toxoptera citricida. Toxoptera citricida {{had been found in}} East Asia and South America, and had slowly made its way up through Central America and the Caribbean Islands. By 1993 it had reached Cuba, and in 1995 it was found in Florida. [...] The aphids require at least 30 to 60 minutes of feeding to acquire the virus, and remain viruliferous for at least 24 hours after. T. citricida is much more efficient than the other aphids, and it can transmit CTV strains causing severe stem pitting or decline that the other aphids cannot vector. Even though A. spiraecola is less efficient, it tends to have higher populations and thus can still transfer the virus fairly well. T. aurantii has been shown to only transmit certain strains of CTV. Of the three lesser efficient aphids, A. gossypii has a 78% transmission efficiency, while A. spiraecola and T. aurantii are between 0-6%. [...] The main cultural practice that increases the severity of the CTV is when the citrus trees are grafted onto the sour orange rootstock. Using CTV infected budwood for grafting can transfer the CTV from the original tree to the new one.|$|E

40|$|Voracity {{and feeding}} {{preferences}} of adult Coccinella septempunctata L. and Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae, tribe Coccinellini) were evaluated {{in the laboratory}} on a common prey, the <b>spirea</b> <b>aphid,</b> Aphis citricola van der Goot (Homoptera: Aphididae), and on the twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acarina: Tetranychidae), a prey previously unrecorded for these two predators. The experiments were {{carried out in the}} laboratory on apple saplings (Malus domestica Borkhausen). Adult males and females of H. axyridis consumed significantly more mites than adults of C. septempunctata. For H. axyridis, males consumed 41. 3 spider mites in 24 h and females 48. 4, whereas for C. septempunctata males consumed 14. 1 prey and females 15. 2. The consumption of spirea aphids by the males was similar for the two species. Consumption by the females was significantly greater for H. axyridis (46. 5) than for C. septempunctata (22. 2). The two coccinellids showed a significant preference for A. citricola in the presence of T. urticae. This preference was more pronounced for C. septempunctata. The total number of prey consumed and the percentage of exploited biomass decreased significantly for C. septempunctata and stayed relatively constant for H. axyridis as the number of mites increased in the prey ratio. Our results suggest that T. urticae is only an alternative prey for both predators, and that H. axyridis should be more efficient than C. septempunctata in a prey assemblage with aphids and mites...|$|E
40|$|Approximately 30 exotic ant {{species have}} been {{introduced}} into New Zealand, including the Argentine ant Linepithema humile (Mayr). Many of these ant species are known to affect horticulture worldwide by tending hemipteran insects. These ants may protect these hemiptera from their natural enemies, resulting in higher pest densities and potential economic loss. Our aim in this work was to survey the ant species associated with the various horticultural crops in the North Island. Our focus was on L. humile, but we also collected other ants and associated hemipteran species. Linepithema humile {{appeared to be an}} opportunistic species and was found on fifteen of eighteen common horticultural crops that we surveyed, as well as on a variety of other plants. It was observed tending 15 different species of hemipteran insects. Linepithema humile has been previously observed tending some of these hemipteran insects overseas, such as the black scale Saissetia oleae (Olivier). Other observed L. humile-hemipteran-plant associations reported here have not previously been recorded, such as with the <b>spirea</b> <b>aphid</b> Aphis spiraecola Patch on plum trees. Eleven other species of ants were found on horticultural crops. Paratrechina vaga (Forel) was common and also tended hemipteran insects on apple, citrus, and tamarillo. Other common ants were Tetramorium grassii Emery, Monomorium antarcticum (Smith), Pheidole rugosula Forel and Ph. vigilans (Smith). Another adventive ant, Ph. megacephala (Fab.), was only sampled in Auckland despite having been in New Zealand for over 50 years. Many of these invasive ants thus do not appear threatening to horticultural crops, though L. humile appears likely to be a significant economic pest for a variety of crops...|$|E
