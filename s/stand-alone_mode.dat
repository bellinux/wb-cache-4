30|$|Considering the {{drawbacks}} of communication-based and communication-less energy management schemes, {{a combination of}} the droop control with communication-based control could have both improved reliability and control performance, and may be a good option for future microgrid systems. In such a combination strategy, with the help of communication-based energy management, the DG operation point in both grid-connected and <b>stand-alone</b> <b>modes</b> can be determined more accurately. Also with the droop control as backbone, the communication requirement (such as speed and bandwidth) can be reduced and failure of the communication links will not cause a system collapse.|$|R
30|$|Other {{than the}} droop control method, if all DGs {{work at the}} MPPT mode, it is not {{necessity}} for communication between DGs.

40|$|Under the {{national}} strategy of ‘building a new socialist countryside’, concentrated rural housing is increasing in some rural regions in China. In this research we use three case studies to analyze decision making on concentrated rural housing {{and the potential}} for future low carbon rural housing. The empirical results show that concentrated rural housing can improve both the energy efficiency of houses and the living conditions of households, compared to traditional <b>stand-alone</b> <b>modes</b> of housing. Providers are the major decision makers with regard to the kind of materials, technologies and energy networks applied in rural housing development. Local governments, private property developers and local (energy) authorities in principle have the power to select and apply low carbon alternatives. The involvement of Chinese householders in concentrated housing project turns out to be low or non-existent. The introduction of market incentives, stricter building regulations, better decision making processes and communication with householders are relevant social factors for improving low carbon housing provision in rural China...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{reference}} signal generator {{is combined with}} a multi-level inverter to form a rapid islanding detection scheme for grid-interactive PV system. The {{reference signal}} generator can easily be synchronized with the utility grid signal and produced a fixed magnitude and very low total harmonic distortion (THD) sinusoidal signal which is in phase with the utility grid signal. Unlike conventional phase-locked loop (PLL) circuitry, the reference signal generator can also provide a fixed magnitude sinusoidal signal even if the utility grid is disconnected and automatically re-synchronous with the grid rapidly. Consequently, seamless transfer between grid-connected and <b>stand-alone</b> <b>modes</b> could easily be achieved if anti-islanding protection is not required. If a saturation element {{is applied to the}} raw reference signal followed by the synthesis of the truncated signal using a multi-level inverter, the distinct flat-top feature of the synthesized signal can quickly and easily be identified if the network is in islanding mode at the point of common coupling. Experimental results are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed detection scheme. Department of Electrical Engineerin...|$|R

Possible issues when utilizing this method are mainly related to the lack of direct control of DG output current, especially during fault or grid voltage disturbances. These problems can be avoided by implementing virtual impedance control at the DG output [38, 44].|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{presents}} a simple theory for {{the transformation of}} non-precipitating, shallow convection into precipitating, deep convective clouds. In {{order to make the}} pertinent point a much idealized system is considered, consisting only of shallow and deep convection without large–scale forcing. The transformation is described by an explicit coupling between these two types of convection. Shallow convection moistens and cools the atmosphere, whereas deep convection dries and warms, leading to destabilization and stabilization respectively. Consequently, in their own <b>stand–alone</b> <b>modes,</b> shallow convection perpetually grows, whereas deep convection simply damps: the former never reaches equilibrium, and the latter is never spontaneously generated. Coupling the modes together {{is the only way to}} reconcile these undesirable separate tendencies so that the convective system as a whole can remain in a stable periodic state under this idealized setting. Such coupling is a key missing element in current global atmospheric models. The energy–cycle description as originally formulated by Arakawa and Schubert, and presented herein is suitable for direct implementation into models using a mass–flux parameterization, and would alleviate the current problems with the representation of these two types of convection in numerical models. The present theory also provides a pertinent framework for analyzing large–eddy simulations and cloud–resolving modelling...|$|R

40|$|Small {{distributed}} generation (DG) systems provide standby service during utility outages and, when operated during peak load hours, potentially reduce energy costs. The connection {{of a generation}} system to the utility grid requires a robust phase locked loop (PLL) and continuous detection of utility grid status (such as outage, over-/under-voltage and over-/underfrequency). This paper details a flexible control strategy to operate a small/micro single-phase DG in both <b>stand-alone</b> and grid-connected <b>modes.</b> The described system is effectively an extended line-interactive uninterruptible power supply (UPS). In particular, a high-performance PLL for single-phase inverters is proposed. The PLL uses a transport delay method to generate a virtual quadrature signal, thereby emulating a balanced threephase system. Furthermore, an orthogonal filter is incorporated to improve the PLL performance when the grid voltage is distorted. To achieve zero steady-state error and to implement selective harmonic compensation, resonant controllers are proposed, for both the voltage regulation in <b>stand-alone</b> control <b>mode</b> and the current regulation in grid-connected control mode. Simulation and experimental results from a 3. 5 kW prototype with a fuel cell as the primary source are included to prove {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed methods...|$|R
40|$|If we are {{to present}} {{instruction}} that is available anytime and anywhere, {{takes advantage of the}} substantial tutorial efficiencies of one teacher for every student, and is affordable, we must have recourse to technology, specifically computer technology. Such technology can be used in instructional applications that range from drill and practice and tutorial dialogues, to multiplayer simulations and games. It can be used in <b>stand-alone</b> <b>modes</b> or {{it can be used to}} supplement classroom instruction. It can be used by individuals or by groups. In all cases, however, it must take account of the current state of the learner, the eventual state of the learner that the instruction is intended to produce, and the instructional techniques that reliably effect transitions from one state to the other. Models of the learner that represent these current and objective states must to an appreciable extent be models of the learner’s cognition, which produces the skills, performance, and competence needed for success in all military operations. These models may be implicit as found in intrinsically programmed instruction, or they may be explicit. Both types may be seen in technology-based instruction from its beginning. Early explicit models were largely quantitative, involving fairly simple instructional paradigms, but fairly elaborate mathematics, including instructional applications of optimal control theory. Current efforts are more concerned with qualitative models, 19 of which are briefly described and discussed. These models all contribute to some degree to the efficiency and effectiveness of technology...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is the {{chemical}} composition emulation of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) outlet flow, with the hybrid system emulator rig developed by TPG at the University of Genoa. To emulate this chemical composition studying its effects on a commercial machine, {{the layout of the}} test rig facility (T 100 machine coupled with a modular vessel) was re-designed and expanded. This plant was equipped with a steam generator system to inject super-heated steam immediately upstream of the machine combustor. Since {{it is not possible to}} re-generate the actual SOFC outlet composition with just steam injection (fuel cell outlet flow has higher percentage value of steam and CO 2 than an expander inlet of a standard machine), this new system is essential to operate the test rig at specific chemical composition similitude condition. The objective of this new component is the developing of experimental data related to a commercial machine coupled with a fuel cell. In details, this paper deals with fuel cell outlet composition effects on main gas turbine properties because it is essential to know machine behaviour when it operates inside a hybrid system (important aspect to prevent risks such as surge). This new layout of the facility is essential to study the effect of steam rich mass flow rate on machine behaviour. For this reason, several tests at different operative conditions were carried out with the T 100 machine operating in both electrical grid-connected and <b>stand-alone</b> <b>modes...</b>|$|R

40|$|In inverter-based microgrids, the paralleled {{inverters}} {{need to work}} in grid-connected {{mode and}} <b>stand-alone</b> <b>mode</b> and to transfer seamlessly between the two modes. In grid-connected mode, the inverters control the amount of power injected into the grid.

Inverters can have different power set points during grid-connected mode, but in <b>stand-alone</b> <b>mode,</b> they all need their power set points to be adjusted according to their power ratings. However, during sudden unintentional islanding (due to loss of mains), transient power can flow from inverters with high power set points to inverters with low power set points, which can raise the dc-link voltage of the inverters causing them to shut down. This paper investigates the transient circulating power between paralleled inverters during unintentional islanding and proposes a controller to limit it.
