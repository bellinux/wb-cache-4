5|$|It is {{alarming}} {{and also}} nauseating to <b>see</b> <b>Mr</b> Gandhi, a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now {{posing as a}} fakir of a type {{well known in the}} East, striding half-naked up the steps of the Vice-regal palace....to parley on equal terms with the representative of the King-Emperor.|$|E
5|$|SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward {{ride the}} wave and they <b>see</b> <b>Mr.</b> Krabs.

SpongeBob, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward are seen flying on the surfboard and approach Goo Lagoon. Sandy's helicopter crash-lands in Goo Lagoon. A welcome home party has been thrown for SpongeBob, and Jack Kahuna Laguna returns with Cashie, which he returns to Mr. Krabs.|$|E
5|$|Susan and David {{defy the}} group and go check on Mr. Griffin. The two find him dead {{as a result of}} {{coronary}} arrest after being unable to take his medication for angina. Mark convinces {{the rest of the group}} to cover up the death. He instructs Susan, who was the last one known to the police to <b>see</b> <b>Mr.</b> Griffin, to tell them Mr. Griffin kept looking at his watch during the conference and left with a pretty woman. Jeff, Mark, and David bury the body in the mountains. Betsy and David also drive Mr. Griffin's car to the airport, but the officer who gave Betsy a ticket sees her there. Worried that the officer might later identify the car as Mr. Griffin's, Jeff and Betsy move the car into Jeff's garage so he can repaint it before they hide it elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|A {{story is}} told of a cricketer who had {{regarded}} Fuller Pilch as the final word in batting, being taken in his old age to <b>see</b> <b>Mr.</b> Grace bat for the first time. He watched the great man {{for a quarter of}} an hour or so and then broke out into an expression of boundless delight. 'Why', he said, 'this man scores continuously from balls that old Fuller would have been thankful to stop'.|$|E
500|$|Walpole sought {{critical}} as well {{as financial}} success, and longed to write works that equalled those of Trollope, Thomas Hardy and Henry James. In his early days, he received frequent and generally approving scrutiny from major literary figures. He {{was a good friend}} of Virginia Woolf, and rated her as an influence; she praised his gift for seizing on telling detail: [...] "it is no disparagement to a writer to say that his gift is for the small things rather than for the large ... If you are faithful with the details the large effects will grow inevitably out of those very details". Joseph Conrad said of him, [...] "We <b>see</b> <b>Mr.</b> Walpole grappling with the truth of things spiritual and material with his characteristic earnestness, and we can discern the characteristics of this acute and sympathetic explorer of human nature." ...|$|E

Mr. Worthington is a {{political}} opponent of Jethro Bass, and wishes Miss Wetherell dismissed. Mr. Dodd and Mr. Hill have agreed, for various reasons which I will spare you, that Miss Wetherell should be dismissed. Have I stated the case, gentlemen, or have I not?" ...|$|R

[...] He also said [...] "It's a nice change of pace to see Plankton and Krabs as chums pre-Chum Bucket and finding out what led to their friendship's {{eventual}} demise. Viewers also get to <b>see</b> <b>Mr.</b> Krabs introduced to 'the love of his life' as he develops the secret formula to the Krabby Patty that Bikini Bottom's residents know and love today." [...] On the DVD, Patrick Cossel of Blogcritics said [...] "Children and adults will laugh out loud at the crazy slapstick antics {{of the one who}} lives under the sea." [...] He added that [...] "This release is sure to be huge hit for SpongeBob fans everywhere." [...] Lesley Aeschliman of Yahoo! Voices was negative on the episode saying [...] "'Friend of Foe?' just felt like a regular episode that really had no reason to be hyped a special." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1927, Treatt {{was given}} the {{position}} of Challis lecturer in criminal law at the University of Sydney, a position he was to hold until 1959. One of his students was the future Justice of the High Court of Australia, Michael Kirby: [...] "I can still <b>see</b> <b>Mr</b> Vernon Treatt QC coming on to {{the stage of the}} Phillip Street Theatre where we took some of our lectures. Treatt's task was to instruct a hundred first year law students in that most important discipline, criminal law. I can see him toss his hat onto the chair, open his notes and begin reading his latest lesson. I can hear him talking about the sections of the Crimes Act 1900 of New South Wales dealing with 'unnatural offences'. I can recall his rasping voice as he intoned the old provisions of section 79, spitting out the exceptionally ugly words of denunciation in the parliamentary prose". In March 1928, Treatt was appointed and served as a Crown Prosecutor for the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the Court of Quarter sessions for the metropolitan district.|$|E
500|$|The second film, Mr. Bean's Holiday, was {{announced}} {{to be in}} development in March 2005, and would <b>see</b> <b>Mr.</b> Bean going to France, [...] despite an earlier rumor in February 2001 stating that unproduced script outline by screenwriter Richard Curtis would see him on an Australian misadventure. Work on the film occurred during 2006 and was directed by Steve Bendelack, with its released in the United Kingdom on 30 March 2007; it premiered in North America on 17 July that year, at the Just for Laughs festival in Canada where the character had been launched 20 years earlier, before being released nationwide over a month later on 24 August. The film follows Bean on an eventful journey across France for a holiday in the French Riviera, which {{after a number of}} misfortunes culminates in an unscheduled screening of his video diary at the Cannes Film Festival. The film is notable for a mixture of traditional movie filmography, and home-shot video camera filmography. The film grossed nearly US$230million globally ($33million in the United States).|$|E

500|$|... "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as one of the classic episodes of South Park. Chris Vognar of The Dallas Morning News described Mr. Hankey himself as [...] "the most outrageous character yet on TV's most outrageous show". Charlie Patton of The Florida Times-Union said the episode was [...] "crude, nasty, irreverent and generally offensive—also extremely funny". He also said of the Mr. Hankey character, [...] "If you're {{the sort of person who}} didn't care for that scene in Trainspotting where the Ewan McGregor character dove down the toilet and into the sewer in pursuit of his lost suppository, the whole Mr. Hankey subplot is going to be deeply disturbing." [...] Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, said, [...] "Technically, the Christmas episode might well be the show's best effort, artistically, because it tackles the PC-ification of Christmas head-on, and also has an interesting psychological subtext: does the hero actually <b>see</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hankey, or does he have some serious psychological problems?" [...] Diane Werts of Newsday said of the episode, [...] "It's gross. It's yucky. It's probably offensive. It's also possibly the funniest holiday episode anybody's airing this year." [...] Werts particularly praised the song [...] "A Lonely Jew on Christmas". Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock, author of Taking South Park Seriously, said, [...] "This episode arguably pushes the boundaries of what is acceptable, both for Christmas specials and television in general, farther than any previous one." [...] Weinstock said this was particularly true of the episode's fake live-action commercial.|$|E
500|$|In his memoir, Eminent Hipsters, Fagen {{notes that}} the cover figure [...] "wasn't {{supposed}} to be a stand-in for any particular jazz DJ," [...] but noted a few personalities from the period that factored into the creation: Ed Beach, Dan Morgenstern, Martin Williams, R.D. Harlan, [...] "Symphony Sid" [...] Torin, and what Fagen regarded as his [...] "main man", WEVD's Mort Fega. [...] "He was laid-back, knowledgeable, and forthright, the cool uncle you wished you'd had." [...] At the time of the album's release, he remembered that jazz music offered him an escape from the adults in his life: [...] "When I saw E.T.,' I realized that the E.T. in my bedroom was my Thelonious Monk records. Everything that he represented was totally unworldly in a way, although at the same time jazz to me seemed more real than the environment in which I was living." [...] The Wall Street Journal Robert J. Toth writes, [...] "The cover adds another layer of autobiography. On the front, we <b>see</b> <b>Mr.</b> Fagen as a crew-cut deejay on the graveyard shift. On the back is his audience, a single lighted window in a row of tract homes — or maybe the artist as a young man, drinking in inspiration." [...] Robert Palmer, of The New York Times, continued in this line of thinking: [...] "Inside, there's a teenager with his ear next to a portable radio. He's playing it softly, so his parents won't wake up, and he can barely make out the sounds through the static. [...] The teenager was Donald Fagen." ...|$|E

[...] Michael Phillips of The Chicago Tribune writes, [...] "Reliably honest and affecting, [...] fights off the waves of corn {{in much the same way}} that Tibetan monk defied the tsunami in 2012." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{a meeting}} of the West Essex Conservative Association, {{specially}} convened so that Churchill could explain his position, he said [...] "It is alarming and also nauseating to <b>see</b> <b>Mr</b> Gandhi, a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir of a type well known in the East, striding half-naked up the steps of the Vice-regal palace... to parley on equal terms with the representative of the King-Emperor."

Barron, {{co-founder of}} GOProud {{who would later}} not only endorse Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, but also launch LGBT for Trump, said he [...] "would love to <b>see</b> <b>Mr.</b> Trump run for president." [...] For the 2012 CPAC conference, the ACU board voted to not invite GOProud or the John Birch Society to the 2012 conference. The 2011 CPAC speech Trump gave is {{credited}} for helping kick-start his political career within the Republican Party. The 2015 CPAC featured Jamila Bey who became the first atheist activist to address CPAC's annual meeting.

2500|$|Peter Kirk, the Conservative MP for Gravesend, criticised the TUCC's {{handling}} of the matter and tried {{to discuss it with}} Ernest Marples, the Minister of Transport. A Ministry of Transport memorandum of 14 April 1961 states that [...] "it would not be proper for the Minister to <b>see</b> <b>Mr</b> Kirk at this stage [...] It may well be that Mr Kirk wished to put forward further representations at this late stage [...] Mr Kirk may, for example, wish to make some criticism {{of the way in which}} the proposals have been heard by the Consultative Committees."

One of the works he selected was Late Spring, with the following comment: [...] " [...] characteristic camera work was imitated by many directors abroads [...] as well, i.e., many people saw and <b>see</b> <b>Mr.</b> Ozu’s movies, right? That’s good. Indeed, one can learn pretty much from his movies. Young prospective movie makers in Japan should, I hope, see more of Ozu’s work.
