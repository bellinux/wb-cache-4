If an environmental or financial assessment is also incorporated, a judgement can be made of those parts of a building that are <b>worth</b> <b>recovering.</b> In this way the deconstruction assessment can form part of a full life cycle assessment. Guidelines are presented according to the level or scale of deconstruction that they assist in, such as recycling, reuse or relocation. The guidelines cover issues of material type, component design, fixing methods, information management and sustainment, and handling methods. It is proposed that design for deconstruction can be implemented in the construction industry to improve the ease of future material and component recovery, and thereby increase the current rates of reuse and recycling...|$|R

40|$|Zora Neale Hurston is a {{complicated}} figure whose work has always aroused contradictory responses. During her lifetime she was often more readily appreciated by white readers who enjoyed her boisterous accounts of apparently unthreatening 'Negroes', than by other African American writers who felt that she pandered to white stereotypes, simplifying the black experience and the black psyche. Neglected for several decades, Hurston was again {{brought to the attention}} of literary and cultural critics in the late seventies by Robert Hemenway and Alice Walker, who published seminal reconsiderations of her work. Since then Hurston has become a central figure, not only in the African American canon, but also in the mainstream, becoming, to paraphrase the critic Hazel Carby, a veritable industry in her own right. Yet she remains a writer who evokes mixed responses. For some she is an exemplary Womanist and an uncomplicated role model. For others, though, she is a reactionary individualist who offers her readers little more than escapism and unexamined nostalgia. Particularly contested is the sort of African American space Hurston describes in her work. Centred on the all-black town of Eatonville, it has seemed to some an ideal space <b>worth</b> <b>recovering</b> for the potential it possesses for sustaining a model of authentic African American life. For others though, it has seemed an irrelevant and reactionary retreat from the complexities and realities of twentieth century life and an ideal, which has little relevance for an increasingly urban black population. In this thesis I intend to examine more closely the space and place that Hurston creates in order to argue that the Eatonville of her texts is more complex and ambiguous than either of these accounts allow...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective: Neurologic {{dysfunction}} after cardiopulmonary bypass {{might be}} due to arterial microembolization. Pericardial suction blood is a possible source of embolic material. Our aim was to determine the capillary-pore flow ability of pericardial suction blood. Methods: Pericardial suction blood from patients undergoing coronary bypass was collected, and pericardial suction blood and venous blood were sampled at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass and before reinfusion of pericardial suction blood. Pericardial suction blood was (n = 10) or was not (n = 10) prefiltered through a 30 -μm cardiotomy screen filter before capillary in vitro analysis. Additionally, in 8 patients the plasma viscosity was measured, and in 5 of these patients, pericardial suction blood capillary deposits were evaluated by using a microscopy-imprint method and fat staining. Capillary flow was tested through 5 -μm pore membranes. Tested components were plasma, plasma-eliminated whole-blood resuspension, and leukocyte/plasma-eliminated erythrocyte resuspension. Initial filtration rate and clogging slope expressed the blood-to-capillary interaction. Results: The plasma-flow profile of pericardial suction blood was highly impaired, with a 47 % reduction in initial filtration rate (P <. 001) and a 142 % steeper clogging slope flow deceleration (P <. 01). This difference was not due to a change in pericardial suction blood viscosity, such as by free hemoglobin, which corresponded to 5. 7 % of the erythrocytes. There were no differences in resuspended whole blood or erythrocytes. The cardiotomy filter had no effect. Microscopy suggested the presence of capillary fat deposits in pericardial suction blood that were not seen with venous plasma (P <. 05). The pericardial suction blood volume was 458 ± 42 mL and contained 95. 6 ± 9. 3 g/L hemoglobin. Conclusions: The pericardial suction blood plasma capillary flow function was highly impaired by liquid fat.

40|$|In 1962, on the {{occasion}} of the congress of the Italian Geological Society on the theme of «The geology of the Apennines» (Rome, 13 - 14 December 1962), Raimondo Selli presented a work entitled «The tectonic problem of the Southern Apennines» in which the stratigraphic and structural lineaments of a wide and complex area stretching from Southern Abruzzi to Northern Calabria were illustrated in detail. This work was never published and the reason is unknown. At about twenty years from the death of Raimondo Selli a typewritten text of this work, which should have been published in 1964 in the Volume 4 of the Memoirs of the Italian Geological Society, has been discovered. Together with the manuscript, an unpublished geological map at a scale of 1 : 100, 000 entitled «Geological Map of Sannio and Surrounding Areas» was recovered. This map covers a wide area of the Southern Apennines from Southern Abruzzi to Irpinia. We do not know exactly the date of compilation, but from the legend we can suppose a date surely before 1962. In the unpublished paper «The tectonic problem of the Southern Apennines» Selli modified quite significantly the ideas expressed in the oral presentation of 1962 and in the previous publications on the geology of the Southern Italy (SELLI, 1957, 1962), but there is no trace of this revision in the legend of the «Geological Map of Sannio and Surrounding Areas». Therefore, we have considered it appropriate to make some brief comments on the content of the unpublished work with the aim of enabling a reading of the geological map that respects the ideas arrived at by its author in 1964. A reading of the map without knowing the content of the unpublished paper, in fact, would not enable the reader, even though expert in the geology of Southern Italy, to fully appreciate its value and above all would not do justice to Raimondo Selli’s capacity to recognize and acknowledge geological evidence in conflict with ideas expressed in its previous publications. On superficial analysis the Geological Map of Sannio and Surrounding Areas could be considered as a document of purely historical value, given that the legend reflects a scheme already surpassed by the same Selli in 1964. In reality, this map is far from obsolete because it is an objective restitution of the geology of the study area not at all influenced by any pre-existing model. The geological map of Selli is therefore an unexplored mine of data still to be fully exploited containing observations that are well <b>worth</b> <b>recovering</b> and studying in the case we wish to realize an efficient update of the geological cartography of the region. Products such as this are increasingly rare today because too often do we see geological maps that derive from models instead of contributing to create them...|$|R
40|$|Macroscopic {{evidence}} of bruising from human bite marks may be inconclusive and routine histochemical methods of showing extravasated erythrocytes can be unreliable.

A modified benzidine method was the most reliable indicator of haemoglobin activity, especially where dispersion into extra-cellular tissues had occurred. The resilience of the erythrocyte peroxidase enzyme to temperature changes and fixation supports the concept of a "pseudo-peroxidase" in those cells.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{contribution}} to the debate on the implications of quantum information theory for the foundations of quantum mechanics. In Part 1, the logical and conceptual status of various notions of information is assessed. It is emphasized that the everyday notion of information is to be firmly distinguished from the technical notions arising in information theory; however it is maintained that in both settings `information' functions as an abstract noun, hence does not refer to a particular or <b>substance</b> (the <b>worth</b> of this point is illustrated in application to quantum teleportation). The claim that `Information is Physical' is assessed and argued to face a destructive dilemma. Accordingly, the slogan may not be understood as an ontological claim, but at best, as a methodological one. The reflections of Bruckner and Zeilinger (2001) and Deutsch and Hayden (2000) on the nature of information in quantum mechanics are critically assessed and some results presented on the characterization of entanglement in the Deutsch-Hayden formalism. Some philosophical aspects of quantum computation are discussed and general morals drawn concerning the nature of quantum information theory. In Part II, following some preliminary remarks, two particular information-theoretic approaches to the foundations of quantum mechanics are assessed in detail. It is argued that Zeilinger's (1999) Foundational Principle is unsuccessful as a foundational principle for quantum mechanics. The information-theoretic characterization theorem of Clifton, Bub and Halvorson (2003) is assessed more favourably, but the generality of the approach is questioned and it is argued that the implications of the theorem for the traditional foundational problems in quantum mechanics remains obscure.
