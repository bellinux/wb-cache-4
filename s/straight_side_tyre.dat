5000|$|Commercial {{applications}} of this metal shaping process often involve complex geometries with <b>straight</b> <b>sides</b> and radii. In such a case, the term stamping {{is used in}} order {{to distinguish between the}} deep drawing (radial tension-tangential compression) and stretch-and-bend (along the <b>straight</b> <b>sides)</b> components. Deep drawing is always accompanied by other forming techniques within the press. These other forming methods include: ...|$|R

40|$|By {{means of}} the theory of the electropotential, the {{geometrical}} shape of a new electro-plating cell was deduced in which the current density along the cathode is linear and can be calculated irectly from the total current and voltage of the cell. The new cell consists of a container with two <b>straight</b> <b>sides</b> intersecting at 45 ~ and two curved sides consisting of rectangular hyperbolic ylinders orthogonal to each other, and each in turn orthogonal to one of the <b>straight</b> <b>sides.</b> One of the <b>straight</b> <b>sides</b> and its opposite curved surface are insulators, the other <b>straight</b> <b>side</b> is the cathode while the remaining curved surface is the anode. The new cell may not only be used for current density studies, but may also be used to determine the total polarization directly from simple measurements onthe cell com-bined with the electrical conductivity of the solution. The use of the Hull cell (1) for making plating tests is well known. I t consists of a small trapezoidal cell in which the two parallel sides are insulators, the third side per...|$|R

50|$|Polygonal masonry is a {{technique}} of stone construction. True polygonal masonry is {{a technique}} wherein the visible surfaces of the stones are dressed with <b>straight</b> <b>sides</b> or joints, giving the block {{the appearance of a}} polygon.|$|R

50|$|Engines were {{originally}} built with flush riveted smokeboxes. After {{the first major}} overhaul, domed rivets were used. These locomotives originally ran with flared tenders, but {{at a later date}} 3500 imp gal <b>straight</b> <b>sided</b> tenders were also used.|$|R

50|$|Now {{often just}} {{referred}} to as a ring mould, the shape is essentially that of a ring shaped cylinder cut in half, as opposed to other ring shaped pans, bundt pans for instance, which are more <b>straight</b> <b>sided</b> and deeper.|$|R
50|$|The fold-and-cut problem {{asks what}} shapes can be {{obtained}} by folding a piece of paper flat, and making a single straight complete cut. The solution, known as the fold-and-cut theorem, states that any shape with <b>straight</b> <b>sides</b> {{can be obtained}}.|$|R

The shell is basically evolute and highly ornamented with close spaced flexious, or sigmoidal, ribbing. The whorl section is compressed with <b>straight</b> <b>sides</b> and strongly arched venter.|$|R
50|$|A flattop grill is {{a cooking}} {{appliance}} {{that resembles a}} griddle but performs differently because the heating element is circular rather than <b>straight</b> (<b>side</b> to side). This heating technology creates an extremely hot and even cooking surface, as heat spreads in a radial fashion over the surface.|$|R
50|$|Round towers, {{also called}} drum towers, are more {{resistant}} to siege technology such as sappers and projectiles than square towers. The round front is more resistant than the <b>straight</b> <b>side</b> of a square tower, just as a load-bearing arch. This principle was already understood in antiquity.|$|R
