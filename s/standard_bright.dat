40|$|Background: One of {{the most}} {{frequently}} investigated hypotheses of the pathophysiology underlying Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a disturbance of circadian rhythms. Since the circadian system as well as other non-visual effects is especially sensitive to blue light, a new light therapy device with blue enriched polychromatic light was tested for its efficacy to treat SAD. Methods: Within one winter 52 patients were treated in one of three conditions: 30 min full spectrum light (9000 lx, 5000 K), 30 min blue-enriched light (9000 lx, 17, 000 K), or 20 min blue-enriched light. The study lasted 22 days with 10 days of morning-light treatment on weekdays during the first 2 weeks. Results: Depressive symptoms (SIGH SAD) diminished over the 3 -week period in all conditions, with no significant differences between conditions. The percentage responders were high, differing from 75 %, 59 % and 71 % for the standard-LT, 30 min blue-enriched-LT, and 20 min blue-enriched-LT, respectively. Conclusion: The lack of superiority of high intensity blue-enriched light over <b>standard</b> <b>bright</b> light treatment does not clearly support nor rule out the possibility of an important role for the circadian system or the blue sensitive non-visual image forming system in general, in the pathophysiology of SAD. The lack of a difference between conditions may also be the result of a saturated response to the high light intensities used. Recent data indeed suggest that low intensity blue-enriched light may be as effective as <b>standard</b> <b>bright</b> light treatment. The possibility of improving light therapy for SAD patients by applying light of shorter duration or at lower light intensities is highly relevant for optimizing treatment and will help to clarify the role of the circadian system and/or the non-image forming photoreceptors in SAD pathophysiology...|$|E

We have recently developed a simple and fast method to monitor sperm chromatin status in field conditions using the Diff-Quik assay which is employed in fertility clinics to assess sperm morphology with <b>standard</b> <b>bright</b> field microscopy. In the present study, we demonstrate that any Diff-Quik-like stain can easily, reproducibly and routinely monitor human sperm chromatin status as well. METHODS: Different Diff-Quik-like stains {{were used to assess}} sperm morphology and the presence of abnormal dark nuclear staining in human sperm from four ART centres. The TUNEL assay was per-formed in the same samples, and fertility outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between TUNEL-positive sperm and dark sperm nuclei. Moreover, associations were also found between the percen-tage of dark sperm nuclei and seminal parameters, embryo development rate, embryo quality and clinical pregnancy, as well as with cryptorchidism, and there was a tendency towards an association with age. A value of 32 % abnormal staining is suggested as a predictive threshold for embryo development and pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Our result...|$|E
40|$|There is {{presented}} an experimental setup for the measurements of photomodulated reflectivity spectra of low-dimensional semiconductor structures with a micrometer spatial (plane) resolution. The setup {{has been developed}} as an extended and improved version of a <b>standard</b> <b>bright</b> configuration, i. e., where the probe beam is provided directly by a broad band light source (e. g., halogen lamp) and then it is dispersed after being reflected off the sample.

Introducing optics, based on a long working distance and a high numerical aperture microscope objective, has allowed decreasing the spot size by three orders of magnitude into the micrometer range for both the probe and the pump beams. The optimization of microphotoreflectance signal to noise ratio has made it possible to detect the normalized reflectivity coefficient changes (∆R /R) from an ultrathin single quantum well formed of the wetting layer in the structure with self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots and from single pillar microresonators of the lateral sizes in the range of single micrometers...|$|E
40|$|The fish embryo {{toxicity}} test (FET) is currently {{one of the}} most advocated animal alternative tests in ecotoxicology. To date, the application of the FET with zebrafish zFET has focused on acute toxicity assessment, where only lethal morphological effects are accounted for. An application of the zFET beyond acute toxicity, however, necessitates the establishment of more refined and quantifiable toxicological endpoints. A valuable tool in this context is the use of gene expression-dependent fluorescent markers that can even be measured in-vivo. We investigated the application of embryos of Tg(fli 1 :EGFP) y 1 for the identification of vasotoxic substances within the zFET. Tg(fli 1 :EGFP) y 1 fish express enhanced GFP in the entire vasculature {{under the control of the}} fli 1 promoter, and thus enable the visualisation of vascular defects in live zebrafish embryos. We assessed the fli 1 driven EGFP-expression in the intersegmental blood vessels (ISVs) qualitatively and quantitatively, and found an exposure concentration related increase in vascular damage for chemicals like triclosan, cartap and genistein. The fluorescence endpoint ISV-length allowed an earlier and more sensitive detection of vasotoxins than the bright field assessment method. In combination with the <b>standard</b> <b>bright</b> field morphological effect assessment, an increase in significance and value of the zFET for a mechanism-specific toxicity evaluation was achieved.

40|$|Cracks {{and other}} defects in ceramic {{materials}} {{can be difficult}} or impossible to examine and photograph due to the extreme lack of contrast. A method for inspecting translucent ceramics using scattered light, also known as vicinal illumination, will be described. This method has been known in the ceramics industry for quite some time, but is not {{well known in the}} testing and failure analysis community. Electronics applications include substrates, packages, multilayer capacitors, and thin film resistors. Ceramic materials are used in electronic applications as microcircuit packages and substrates which carry signals and power between microcircuits. Fine cracks in ceramic materials can result in mechanical failures, electrical failures, and loss of hermeticity. Often, fine cracks are difficult or impossible to detect using standard nondestructive inspection techniques such as visual inspection, ultrasonic inspection, or vapor crack detection. Dye penetrant inspection is usually effective, but contaminates the part, which is unacceptable for space flight hardware. One effective nondestructive inspection method of detecting cracks involves examining the way in which light scatters through the ceramic material when viewed with a <b>standard</b> <b>bright</b> field reflected light microscope. This method, termed vicinal illumination, has been used for detecting cracks during failure analyses of several part types, and screening of space flight hardware.

40|$|The imaging {{of objects}} by <b>standard</b> <b>bright</b> field {{microscopy}} {{is limited by}} the wavelength of light. A technique that allows for a higher resolution is atomic force microscopy (AFM). In this technique the topography of a surface is mapped by measuring the force acting on an extremely sharp tip when it is scanned over a surface of interest. In this thesis the functionalization of AFM probes is explored, which gives exciting additional possibilities next to imaging. Regarding actuation, the integration of an electrostatic microactuator in the probe was investigated, motivated by the drive towards high-speed (video-rate) AFM. To make the integration more straightforward, a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) compatible fabrication process for the fabrication of in-plane tips was developed and tested. With this process, sharp silicon nitride tips (best measured radius 8 nm) can be batch fabricated on monocrystalline silicon cantilevers with arbitrary shapes. Electrochemical sensing functionality in AFM was obtained by filling a fountain pen probe with mercury, resulting in an in-situ renewable mercury microelectrode. Both dropping mercury electrode and hanging mercury droplet configurations were obtained, depending on the pressure applied on the mercury. Chronoamperometric measurements and cyclic and square-wave voltammograms were obtained with the potential of microscale spatial resolution. Liquid deposition in AFM was studied by using nanofountain pen probes with various tip shapes. Arrays of spots were deposited in contact mode by spotting and writing lines which subsequently break up into droplets. Contactless deposition was achieved by using electrohydrodynamic deposition. On a dedicated setup, the electrospray onset voltage was studied as a function of gap height, liquid properties and applied external pressure. In a commercial AFM setup, liquid deposition was obtained at voltages down to 60 V at an initial gap of 640 nm. Dried deposits of dissolved sodium sulfate with sizes down to 50 nm were achieved.

40|$|We {{calculate}} the radiative driving force for winds around rapidly rotating oblate B stars, and we estimate the impact these forces should {{have on the}} production of a wind compressed disk. The effects of limb darkening, gravity darkening, oblateness, and an arbitrary wind velocity field are included in the computation of vector 'oblate finite disk' (OFD) factors, which depend on both radius and colatitude in the wind. The impact of limb darkening alone, with or without rotation, can increase the mass loss by as much as 10 % over values computed using the <b>standard</b> uniformly <b>bright</b> spherical finite disk factor. For rapidly rotating stars, limb darkening makes 'sub-stellar' gravity darkening the dominant effect in the radial and latitudinal OFD factors, and lessens the impact of gravity darkening at other visible latitudes (nearer to the oblate limb). Thus, the radial radiative driving is generally stronger over the poles and weaker over the equator, following the gravity darkening at these latitudes. The nonradial radiative driving is considerably smaller in magnitude than the radial component, but is directed both away from the equatorial plane and in a retrograde azimuthal direction, acting to decrease the effective stellar rotation velocity. These forces thus weaken the equatorward wind compression compared to wind models computed with nonrotating finite disk factors...|$|R

Results {{were used for the}} analysis of real objects inside the living mammalian cell. For the design of these algorithms was necessary to first understand how the image in the microscope is build, including a variety of lens aberrations. It was necessary to start with simulations of ideal case displaying one point (simulation PSF). Images of Airy discs in the plane of focus, or simulations using the ENZ theory. Available ENZ simulations provide only a few sections of different focal planes. It was necessary to adjust them to a usable form for generating a full 3 D view. Using these algorithms, it was examined the behavior of the basic lens aberrations, and the behavior of two particles (objects) at different distances from each other. At the conclusion of these observations, it was necessary to redefine the terms Focus and resolution. Furthermore, the definitions have been introduced for discriminability and distinguishability of objects in an image.

We also detail some of the energetics involved that will make such scenarios plausible.

The BOA spectral resolution at LP 3 for the G 130 M grating is determined by a line-width analysis to be dλ= 0. 21 – 0. 22 A ̊ (FWHM), corresponding to a resolving power R ≈ 5800, with no difference between the values measured at 1193 and 1260 Å. This compares to dλ= 0. 14 A ̊ (R= 9000) measured at LP 2 and dλ= 0. 17 Å (R= 7000) at LP 1. For G 160 M, we determine dλ= 0. 10 – 0. 13 A ̊ at 1548 Å, (R= 11900...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} crowded field integral field (3 D) spectrophotometry as {{a useful}} technique {{for the study of}} resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxies. As a methodological test, we present a pilot study with selected extragalactic planetary nebulae (XPN) in the bulge of M 31, demonstrating how 3 D spectroscopy is able to improve the limited accuracy of background subtraction which one would normally obtain with classical slit spectroscopy. It is shown that due to the absence of slit effects, 3 D is a most suitable technique for spectrophometry. We present spectra and line intensities for 5 XPN in M 31, obtained with the MPFS instrument at the Russian 6 m BTA, INTEGRAL at the WHT, and with PMAS at the Calar Alto 3. 5 m Telescope. Using 3 D spectra of <b>bright</b> <b>standard</b> stars, we demonstrate that the PSF is sampled with high accuracy, providing a centroiding precision at the milli-arcsec level. Crowded field 3 D spectrophotometry and the use of PSF fitting techniques is suggested as the method of choice for a number of similar observational problems, including luminous stars in nearby galaxies, supernovae, QSO host galaxies, gravitationally lensed QSOs, and others.
