25|$|Another device {{which has}} contributed {{significantly}} to milk quality is the plate heat exchanger (PHE). This device utilizes a number of specially designed stainless steel plates with small spaces between them. Milk is passed between every other <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>plates</b> with water being passed between {{the balance of the}} plates to remove heat from the milk. This method of cooling can remove large amounts of heat from the milk in a very short time, thus drastically slowing bacteria growth and thereby improving milk quality. Ground water is the most common source of cooling medium for this device. Dairy cows consume approximately 3 gallons of water for every gallon of milk production and prefer to drink slightly warm water as opposed to cold ground water. For this reason, PHE's can result in drastically improved milk quality, reduced operating costs for the dairymen by reducing the refrigeration load on his bulk milk cooler, and increased milk production by supplying the cows with a source of fresh warm water.|$|E

5000|$|Weight {{machines}} commonly use specialized <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> <b>plates</b> (called [...] "weight stacks"), consisting <b>of</b> a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> rectangular <b>plates</b> {{mounted on}} rails. The load is {{transmitted to the}} user of the machine via a cable and pulley arrangement. The weight used is selected by inserting a pin in the stack that causes each plate above the pin to be pulled by the cable. This arrangement {{is known as a}} [...] "selectorized" [...] weight machine.|$|R
25|$|Some {{displays}} {{for early}} computers (those {{that needed to}} display more text than was practical using vectors, or that required high speed for photographic output) used Charactron CRTs. These incorporate a perforated metal character mask (stencil), which shapes a wide electron beam to form a character on the screen. The system selects a character on the mask using one set of deflection circuits, but that causes the extruded beam to be aimed off-axis, so {{a second set of}} deflection plates has to re-aim the beam so it is headed {{toward the center of the}} screen. A third <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>plates</b> places the character wherever required. The beam is unblanked (turned on) briefly to draw the character at that position. Graphics could be drawn by selecting the position on the mask corresponding to the code for a space (in practice, they were simply not drawn), which had a small round hole in the center; this effectively disabled the character mask, and the system reverted to regular vector behavior. Charactrons had exceptionally long necks, because of the need for three deflection systems.|$|E

2500|$|With Cowdery as scribe, Smith {{continued}} dictating what he {{said was}} the translation of the golden plates. On or before May 1829, Smith dictated a revelation warning him that whoever had stolen the 116 manuscript pages was planning to wait until Smith re-translated that section of the golden plates, and then alter it, to show Smith could not translate the same words twice [...] Therefore, according to the revelation, God's plan was for Smith to [...] "go on unto the finishing of the remainder of the work as you [...] had begun" [...] , and instead of going back and re-translating the original 116 manuscript pages, Smith was to substitute a translation which he would create from another <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>plates,</b> called the [...] "plates of Nephi", which covered roughly the same material, except in more detail [...]|$|E

2500|$|The {{experimental}} determination {{has been made}} in vacuum. However, the vacuum we know is not the only possible vacuum which can exist. The vacuum has energy associated with it, called simply the vacuum energy, which could perhaps be altered in certain cases. When vacuum energy is lowered, light itself has been predicted to go faster than the standard value c. This is known as the Scharnhorst effect. Such a vacuum can be produced by bringing two perfectly smooth metal plates together at near atomic diameter spacing. It is called a Casimir vacuum. Calculations imply that light will go faster in such a vacuum by a minuscule amount: a photon traveling between two plates that are 1 micrometer apart would increase the photon's speed by only about one part in 1036. Accordingly, there has as yet been no experimental verification of the prediction. A recent analysis argued that the Scharnhorst effect cannot be used to send information backwards in time with a single <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>plates</b> since the plates' rest frame would define a [...] "preferred frame" [...] for FTL signalling. However, with multiple pairs of plates in motion relative to one another the authors noted that they had no arguments that could [...] "guarantee the total absence of causality violations", and invoked Hawking's speculative chronology protection conjecture which suggests that feedback loops of virtual particles would create [...] "uncontrollable singularities in the renormalized quantum stress-energy" [...] on the boundary of any potential time machine, and thus would require a theory of quantum gravity to fully analyze. Other authors argue that Scharnhorst's original analysis, which seemed to show the possibility of faster-than-c signals, involved approximations which may be incorrect, so that {{it is not clear whether}} this effect could actually increase signal speed at all.|$|E

6000|$|For {{two days}} Aladdin {{remained}} in the dark, crying and lamenting. At last he clasped his hands in prayer, {{and in so doing}} rubbed the ring, which the magician had forgotten to take from him. Immediately an enormous and frightful genie rose out of the earth, saying: [...] "What wouldst thou with me? I am the Slave of the Ring, and will obey thee in all things." [...] Aladdin fearlessly replied: [...] "Deliver me from this place!" [...] whereupon the earth opened, and he found himself outside. As soon as his eyes could bear the light he went home, but fainted on the threshold. When he came to himself he told his mother what had passed, and showed her the lamp and the fruits he had gathered in the garden, which were, in reality, precious stones. He then asked for some food. [...] "Alas! child," [...] she said, [...] "I have nothing in the house, but I have spun a little cotton and will go and sell it." [...] Aladdin bade her keep her cotton, for he would sell the lamp instead. As it was very dirty she began to rub it, that it might fetch a higher price. Instantly a hideous genie appeared, and asked what she would have. She fainted away, but Aladdin, snatching the lamp, said boldly: [...] "Fetch me something to eat!" [...] The genie returned with a silver bowl, twelve silver plates containing rich meats, two silver cups, and two bottles of wine. Aladdin's mother, when she came to herself, said: [...] "Whence comes this splendid feast?" [...] "Ask not, but eat," [...] replied Aladdin. So they sat at breakfast till it was dinner-time, and Aladdin told his mother about the lamp. She begged him to sell it, and {{have nothing to do with}} devils. [...] "No," [...] said Aladdin, [...] "since chance hath made us aware of its virtues, we will use it, and the ring likewise, which I shall always wear on my finger." [...] When they had eaten all the genie had brought, Aladdin sold one of the silver plates, and so on until none were left. He then had recourse to the genie, who gave him another <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>plates,</b> and thus they lived for many years.|$|E
