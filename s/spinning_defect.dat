40|$|Spinning of {{a common}} {{aluminum}} automotive casting alloy A 356 (Al- 7 Si- 0. 3 Mg) at elevated temperatures has been investigated experimentally with a novel industrial-scale apparatus. This has permitted {{the implementation of a}} fully coupled thermomechanical finite element model aimed at quantifying the processing history (stress, strain, strain-rate and temperature) and predicting the final geometry. The geometric predictions of this model have been compared directly to the geometry of the workpieces obtained experimentally. This study is novel in regards to both {{the size and shape of}} the component as well as the constitutive material representation employed. The model predictions are in reasonable agreement with experimental results for small deformations, but errors increase for large deformation conditions. The model has also enabled the characterization of the mechanical state which leads to a common <b>spinning</b> <b>defect.</b> Suggestions for improving the accuracy and robustness of the model to provide a predictive tool for industry are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Atomic-size <b>spin</b> <b>defects</b> in solids {{are unique}} quantum systems. Most {{applications}} require nanometer positioning accuracy, which is typically achieved by low energy ion implantation. So far, a drawback {{of this technique}} is the significant residual implantation-induced damage to the lattice, which strongly degrades the performance of spins in quantum applications. In this letter we show that the charge state of implantation-induced defects drastically influences the formation of lattice defects during thermal annealing. We demonstrate that charging of vacancies localized at e. g. individual nitrogen implantation sites suppresses the formation of vacancy complexes, resulting in a tenfold-improved spin coherence time of single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. This has been achieved by confining implantation defects into the space charge layer of free carriers generated by a nanometer-thin boron-doped diamond structure. Besides, a twofold-improved yield of formation of NV centers is observed. By combining these results with numerical calculations, we arrive at a quantitative understanding of the formation and dynamics of the implanted <b>spin</b> <b>defects.</b> The presented results {{pave the way for}} improved engineering of diamond <b>spin</b> <b>defect</b> quantum devices and other solid-state quantum systems...|$|R

Further the doping dependences of both transition temperature of spin-Peierls state and the spin gap have been calculated.

40|$|Single-walled zigzag carbon {{nanotubes}} with h hexagons {{around the}} carbon nanotube, h ranging from  3 to  19, {{have been investigated}} from a resonating-valence-bond point of view. The energies calculated for the undoped h= 3 n– 1 zigzag carbon nanotubes, n integer, suggest that the two lowest-lying phases are degenerate. Therefore, de-confined low-energy topological <b>spin</b> <b>defects</b> would occur. Then, these carbon nanotubes should be conductors, in analogy to polyacethylene. In clear contrast, no such degeneracy is obtained for either, h= 3 n+ 1 or h= 3 n, so bound pairs of topological <b>spin</b> <b>defects</b> are expected to occur in these cases.

40|$|Controlling the {{dynamics}} of a dipolar-coupled spin system {{is critical to the}} development of solid-state spin-based quantum information processors. Such control remains challenging, as every spin is coupled to a large number of surrounding spins. In this thesis, we primarily focus on developing coherent control techniques for such large spin systems. We start by experimentally simulating spin squeezing using a liquid-state NMR quantum information processor. We demonstrate that the precision of quantum control obtained using strongly modulating pulses was sufficient to reproduce the theoretically expected behavior of the spin observables and the associated entanglement measures among the underlying qubits. We then investigate coherent control in a more complex solid-state spin system consisting of an ensemble of spin pairs. Using pulse amplitude modulation techniques, we decouple the weaker interactions between different pairs and extend the coherence lifetimes within the two-spin system. This is achieved without decoupling the stronger interaction between the two spins within a pair. We thus demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} restrict the evolution of a dipolar coupled spin network to a much smaller subspace of the system Hilbert space which allows us to significantly extend the phase coherence times for selected states. Finally, we demonstrate the sensitivity of highly correlated multiple-quantum states to the presence of rare <b>spin</b> <b>defects</b> in a solid-state spin system. (cont.) We design two multiple-pulse control sequences - one that suspends all spin interactions in the system including that of the <b>defect</b> <b>spins,</b> while the other selectively allows the <b>defect</b> <b>spins</b> to interact only with the abundant spins. By measuring the effective relaxation time of the rare spins, we demonstrate the efficiency of the two control sequences. Furthermore we observe that for small spin cluster sizes, the sensitivity of the highly correlated spin states to the <b>spin</b> <b>defects</b> depends on the coherence order of these correlated spin states. But beyond a certain cluster size, one observes a saturation effect as the higher coherence orders are no longer increasingly sensitive to the <b>defect</b> <b>spin</b> dynamics. by Suddhasattwa Sinha.

40|$|Paramagnetic defects {{produced}} by phosphorus ion implantation of C 60 films {{and the influence}} of annealing on dangling bonds defect center have been studied by electron spin resonance (ESR) to improve the properties of P+-implanted C 60 films for solar cell applications. The films implanted at room temperature reveal the presence of a paramagnetic defect center, which originated from the carbon dangling bonds, with g= 2. 0036 &# 0177; 0. 0004. The volume concentration of the defect center increases with the implantation dose, from approximately 4. 5 &# 0215; 1021 to 4. 6 &# 0215; 1022 cm&# 8722; 3 for the lowest implantation dose of 1 &# 0215; 1013 P+ ions cm&# 8722; 2 and the highest implantation dose of 5 &# 0215; 1015 P+ ions cm&# 8722; 2, respectively. The increase in dose also causes a narrowing of the line width (from 2. 6 to 2. 15 G) although the g-value of the single Lorentzian line remains unchanged. The narrowing is attributed to exchange (motional) interaction. The ESR results imply that no significant graphitization has occurred as a result of implantation. Furthermore, upon annealing at a temperature of 773 K the <b>spin</b> <b>defect</b> density is reduced by a factor of 3. 5, while the g-value remains centered at the same magnetic field.
