The meridional flow is faster at minimum and slower at maximum.

The average latitudinal profile is largely a simple sinusoid that extends to the poles and peaks at about 35 ◦ latitude. As the cycle progresses, a pattern of inflows toward the sunspot zones develops and moves equatorward in step with the sunspot zones. These inflows are accompanied by the torsional oscillations. This association is consistent with the effects of the Coriolis force acting on the inflows. The equatorward motions associated with these inflows are identified as the source of the decrease in net poleward flow at cycle maxima. We also find pola...|$|R
40|$|Polarimetric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (PolSAR) has achieved a prominent position as a remote imaging method. However, PolSAR images are contaminated by speckle noise due to the coherent illumination employed during the data acquisition. This noise provides a granular aspect to the image, making its processing and analysis (such as in edge detection) hard tasks. This paper discusses seven methods for edge detection in multilook PolSAR images. In all methods, the basic idea consists in detecting transition points in the finest possible <b>strip</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> which spans two regions. The edge is contoured using the transitions points and a B-spline curve. Four stochastic distances, two differences of entropies, and the maximum likelihood criterion were used under the scaled complex Wishart distribution; the first six stem from the h-phi class of measures. The performance of the discussed detection methods was quantified and analyzed by the computational time and probability of correct edge detection, {{with respect to the}} number of looks, the backscatter matrix as a whole, the SPAN, the covariance an the spatial resolution. The detection procedures were applied to three real PolSAR images. Results provide evidence that the methods based on the Bhattacharyya distance and the difference of Shannon entropies outperform the other techniques. Comment: 12 pages, 14 figure...|$|R

The aim of our study is to provide a new method for faulting detection and computation on jointed concrete pavements. Nowadays, the assessment of faulting is performed with the use of laborious and time-consuming measurements that strongly hinder aircraft traffic. We proposed a field procedure for Terrestrial Laser Scanner data acquisition and a computation flow chart in order to identify and quantify the fault size at each joint of apron slabs. The total point cloud has been used to compute the least square plane fitting those points. The best-fit plane for each slab has been computed too. The attitude of each slab plane with respect to both the adjacent ones and the apron reference plane has been determined by the normal vectors to the surfaces. Faulting has been evaluated as the difference in elevation between the slab planes along chosen sections.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is the photogrammetric study of the geometric properties of aircraft multispectral scanner data. The research involves three areas; the use of Gauss-Markov processes in single strip rectification procedures, the use of spatial block adjustment techniques with multiple sidelapping strips, and the implementation of object space geometric constraints into aircraft MSS restitution algorithms. ^ The research into Gauss-Markov processes involves {{the study of the}} theoretical nature of the processes and their application in a rigorous and efficient manner to aircraft MSS <b>data</b> restitution. Comparisons <b>of</b> the results using first and second order Gauss-Markov processes show that the second order process gives results equal to or slightly worse than those of the first order, while taking more execution time. The first order Gauss-Markov is therefore chosen as the optimum method. ^ The spatial block adjustment algorithm was implemented using the collinearity technique, constrained segmentation <b>of</b> <b>strips,</b> a priori weighting of parameters and constraints, and complete editing and evaluation statistics. Tests were conducted, using three sidelapping <b>strips</b> <b>of</b> <b>data,</b> to compare single and multiple strip adjustments, to determine the effect of constrained segmentation <b>of</b> the <b>strips,</b> and to evaluate the determinancy of the (omega) and (phi) orientation parameters. It is concluded that constrained segmentation does have a beneficial effect and that the determination of points by the use <b>of</b> multiple sidelapping <b>strips,</b> is more accurate than using only one ray. Inclusion of the (omega) parameter improves the accuracy, although high correlations result among the orientation parameters. Due to the lack of terrain relief in the data set used, the (phi) parameter was not recoverable. ^ The mathematical basis for the use of object space straight line constraints is developed and their application outlined. Tests using single strips show that accuracy and precision of points on the line are greatly improved, with some improvements for other points in the adjustment. It is possible to use the straight line constraints in place of elevation assignment for single ray points. The use of straight line constraints also improved the results <b>of</b> multiple <b>strip</b> adjustments. ...|$|R
