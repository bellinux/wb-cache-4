[...] Their recommendations maintained the current classification of glyphosate as a substance causing <b>serious</b> <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> and as a substance toxic to aquatic life. [...] However, the RAC did not find evidence implicating glyphosate to be a carcinogen, a mutagen, [...] as toxic to reproduction, nor as toxic to specific organs.|$|E
2500|$|While {{glyphosate}} and formulations such as Roundup {{have been}} approved by regulatory bodies worldwide, concerns about their effects on humans and the environment persist. Many regulatory and scholarly reviews have evaluated the relative toxicity of glyphosate as an herbicide. The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment toxicology review in 2013 found that [...] "the available data is contradictory and far from being convincing" [...] with regard to correlations between exposure to glyphosate formulations and risk of various cancers, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). A meta-analysis published in 2014 identified {{an increased risk of}} NHL in workers exposed to glyphosate formulations. In March 2015 the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as [...] "probablynbsp&carcinogenicnbsp&in humans" [...] (category 2A) based on epidemiological studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies. In November, 2015, the European Food Safety Authority published an updated assessment report on glyphosate, concluding that [...] "the substance is unlikely to be genotoxic (i.e. damaging to DNA) or to pose a carcinogenic threat to humans." [...] Furthermore, the final report clarified that while other, probably carcinogenic, glyphosate-containing formulations may exist, studies [...] "that look solely at the active substance glyphosate do not show this effect." [...] The WHO and FAO Joint committee on pesticide residues issued a report in 2016 confirming that the use of glyphosate formulations does not constitute a health risk and also gave admissible daily intake limits for chronic toxicity. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) maintained their current classification of glyphosate as a substance causing <b>serious</b> <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> and as a substance toxic to aquatic life, but did not find evidence implicating it to be a carcinogen, a mutagen, toxic to reproduction, nor toxic to specific organs.|$|E

50|$|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer hired Haley for {{the part}} of the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz after its {{contracted}} song-and-dance comedian Buddy Ebsen suffered an almost fatal allergic reaction. He had unwittingly inhaled some of the aluminum dust that composed the majority of the components that went into the creation of his silver face makeup. Bits of it instantly began to settle on his lungs and within a few days of principal photographic testing, he found himself preparing to sit down to dinner one night only to encounter difficulties taking a regular breath of oxygen. The dust was subsequently converted into a paste for Haley {{in the hope that the}} previous catastrophe that befell Ebsen would not be repeated. This time around, however, a different incident occurred. The application of the aluminum paste to Haley's face resulted in an eye infection that led to his being off the set for four days of shooting. Appropriate surgical treatment was administered and any chance of <b>serious</b> or permanent <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> averted. Haley also portrayed the Tin Man's Kansas counterpart, Hickory, one of Aunt Em and Uncle Henry's farmhands.|$|R

5000|$|MSF is a clear, colorless to {{yellowish}} {{hygroscopic liquid}} (attracts and holds water by absorption or adsorption). It is corrosive and highly toxic. It is an oxydiaphoric inhibitor (acid-transferring inhibitor) of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. MSF, {{which is a}} liquid at room temperature, has a vapor pressure of 19.2 mmHg, slightly more volatile than water which has a vapor pressure of 18.8 mmHg at 21 °C. This vapor has an LCt50 (lethal concentration, 50% death rate in a given time) in rats of between 4 and 5 parts per million (ppm) during one hour of exposure or between 1 and 1.2 ppm during 7 hours of exposure. MSF produced no subtle biological effects from direct action of MSF independent {{of its ability to}} inhibit cholinesterase. Repeated exposures to 1/10 of the LCt50 did not produce overt systemic toxicity or significant pathology. [...] MSF can also cause severe skin burns and <b>serious</b> <b>eye</b> <b>damage,</b> if contact is made. It is a lachrymator and its vapor causes tears in eyes.|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of ocular toxicity, (i. e., eye irritation and <b>serious</b> <b>eye</b> <b>damage)</b> {{is important to}} ensure the safety of products and their components used in our daily life. In several EU legislations related to chemicals and products, the generation of information on eye irritation and <b>serious</b> <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> represents a standard requirement. The traditional eye irritation test, also known as the Draize eye test. is performed on albino rabbits. Ethical and scientific considerations as well as legal requirements in EU legislations have triggered the development and validation of alternative methods to the Draize test. Since no in vitro test taken individually can nowadays fully replace the Draize eye test, testing schemes combining strengths of particular in vitro assays were proposed The conceptual framework of testing strategies based on a Bottom-Up or Top-Down approach, are described in this chapter. In addition, a summary of the most promising in vitro test methods as well as their validation and regulatory acceptance status is given. Finally some strategic proposals on the way forward in this area are made. JRC. I. 5 -Systems Toxicolog...|$|E

40|$|This state-of-the art {{review is}} based on the final report of a project carried out by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) for the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). The aim of the project was to review the state of the science of {{non-standard}} methods that are available for assessing the toxicological and ecotoxicological properties of chemicals. Non-standard methods refer to alternatives to animal experiments, such as in vitro tests and computational models, as well as animal methods that are not covered by current regulatory guidelines. This report therefore reviews the current scientific status of non-standard methods for a range of human health and ecotoxicological endpoints, and provides a commentary on the mechanistic basis and regulatory applicability of these methods. For completeness, and to provide context, currently accepted (standard) methods are also summarised. In particular, the following human health endpoints are covered: a) skin irritation and corrosion; b) <b>serious</b> <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> and eye irritation; c) skin sensitisation; d) acute systemic toxicity; e) repeat dose toxicity; f) genotoxicity and mutagenicity; g) carcinogenicity; h) reproductive toxicity (including effects on development and fertility); i) endocrine disruption relevant to human health; and j) toxicokinetics. In relation to ecotoxicological endpoints, the report focuses on non-standard methods for acute and chronic fish toxicity. While specific reference is made to the information needs of REACH, the Biocidal Products Regulation and the Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation, this review is also expected to be informative in relation to the possible use of alternative and non-standard methods in other sectors, such as cosmetics and plant protection products.

40|$|Background/Aim. Soft {{contact lenses}} occupy {{significant}} place in ophthalmology, {{both in the}} correction of refraction anomalies and {{in the treatment of}} many eye diseases. The number of patients that wear soft contact lenses for the purpose of correcting ametropia is constantly increasing. Due to the increasing number of wearers, the percentage of complications that can lead to <b>serious</b> <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> and serious vision loss is also increasing. The aim {{of this study was to}} point out the most common complications related to soft contact lens use. Methods. In the period from 1995 − 2004 this prospective study included 510 patients wearing soft contact lenses for correcting ametropia. None of the patients wore contact lenses before and none suffered from any system or local diseases that could affected the development of eventual complications. The study took seven years with the patients who wore conventional lenses and three years with those who wore replacement contact lenses. All the necessary ophthalmologic examinations were done (visual acuity, refractokeratometry, the quantity of tear film, biomicroscopic examination of anterior eye segment). All the complications were filmed by video camera. Results. Of all the patients, 19 had blepharitis, 73 suffered from “dry eye”, 57 had conjunctival hyperemia, 12 had conjunctivitis, 34 had gigantopapillary conjunctivitis (GPC), 93 had punctiform epitheliopathy, 20 had corneal infiltration, one patient had keratitis, 91 had corneal vascularisation, and 95 patients had corneal deposits. Conclusion. Both the type and frequency of complications related to soft contact lens use in our group of patients, proved to be significant. Some of this complications (keratitis) can significantly damage vision and lead to loss of vision and sometimes can require operative treatment...|$|E

40|$|Laser {{pointers}} {{are completely}} safe when properly {{used as a}} visual or instructional aid. However, they can cause <b>serious</b> <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> when used improperly. There have been enough documented injuries from laser pointers to trigger a warning from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA and Safety Notification). Before deciding to use a laser pointer, presenters are reminded to consider alternate methods of calling attention to specific items. Most presentation software packages offer screen pointer options with the same features, but without the laser hazard. Selecting a Safe Laser Pointer 1) Choose low power lasers (Class 2 or 3 R, formerly 3 a) Whenever possible, select a Class 2 laser pointer because of the lower risk of eye damage. If a more powerful laser is required, presenters may use a Class 3 R laser {{with the understanding that}} greater responsibility and care are required. Laser devices with other laser classes are inappropriate for use as a laser pointer (see Identifying Laser Characteristics below). 2) Choose red-orange lasers (633 to 650 nm wavelength, choose closer to 635 nm) Early diode laser pointers were dark red (670 nm wavelength) and difficult to see due to the eye’s lower response to red. Newer red-orange lasers are significantly brighter than their dark red predecessors using the same or even less power. See below for available products. Green and blue laser pointers are available, however each has serious drawbacks 1. Initially, green will appear brighter than red. However, green may actually be too bright and has been found to leave a distracting after-image on the retina, making it difficult to concentrate on the presentation. Safety concerns have been raised about photo-biological effects from blue light laser pointers (400 - 500 nm) and they should be avoided. 3) On/Off Switch Ensure that the on switch is a momentary contact type that is designed to shut off the pointer when released. Use of a laser pointed with a locking device to keep the laser beam on is prohibited. Each label includes: the starburst insignia, laser classification, maximu...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBoth a {{prospective}} and a retrospective validation study were undertaken {{to assess the}} suitability of the Ocular Irritection® assay to discriminate ocular hazards {{as defined by the}} OECD and UN Globally Harmonized System (UN GHS) for classification. The primary focus {{of the study was to}} evaluate the usefulness of the Ocular Irritection® assay to reliably discriminate chemicals not requiring classification (UN GHS non-classified), from classified chemicals (UN GHS Categories 1 and 2). Furthermore a post-hoc evaluation was carried out to evaluate the usefulness of the assay to discriminate chemicals inducing <b>serious</b> <b>eye</b> <b>damage</b> (UN GHS Category 1) from other classes. The prospective validation study was conducted between 2009 and 2012 following internationally agreed principles. A set of 56 coded test chemicals for which quality and/or peer-reviewed in vivo data were available were used to obtain prospective data on the assay’s reliability (reproducibility within and between laboratories) and relevance (predictive capacity). The assay showed good within-laboratory variability, transferability including to a naïve laboratory, and between-laboratory concordance of classifications (82 % for the discrimination of non-classified from classified chemicals, and 83 % for the discrimination of Category 1 from other classes). The obtained prospective data were then combined with existing data on the Ocular Irritection® collected from various sources, totaling 88 chemicals with parallel in vivo and in vitro data to obtain a comprehensive assessment of the test method performances. The enlarged dataset comprised 43 non-classified, 25 Category 2 and 20 Category 1 chemicals according to the UN GHS classification. When used for the identification of UN GHS non-classified versus classified materials (based on the existing cut-off of 12. 5) the Ocular Irritection® assay showed an overall a sensitivity of 93 % and a specificity of 58 %. An evaluation on possible reasons for misclassification identified some organic functional groups (acrylate, carboxamide and cycloalkene) to correlate with the observed mispredictions. If these functional groups were excluded from the Ocular Irritection® applicability domain, the obtained dataset (n= 79 chemicals distributed as 41 UN GHS Classified and 38 Non-Classified chemicals) had an overall sensitivity of 98 %, and specificity of 63 %, which is in line with currently adopted test methods. When used for the identification of UN GHS Category 1 versus other categories (based on the existing cut-off of 30. 0) the Ocular Irritection® assay showed an overall specificity of 81 % and a sensitivity of 50 % which is again in line with currently adopted test methods. The Ocular Irritection® assay appeared therefore as a useful test method to predict chemicals not requiring classification for eye hazards according to the UN GHS classification system. Furthermore the method was found suitable to identify serious/irreversible eye damage (UN GHS Category 1). The detailed documentation and results of the study have been submitted to an internationally recognized validation centre for peer-review...|$|E
