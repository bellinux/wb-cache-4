40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{structural}} {{sound and}} vibration control using passive and semi-active shunt piezoelectric damping circuits is presented. A piezoelectric patch with an electrical shunt circuit is bonded to a base structure. When the structure vibrates, the piezoelectric patch strains and transforms the mechanical {{energy of the}} structure into electrical energy, which can be effectively dissipated by the shunt circuit. Hence, the shunt circuit acts {{as a means of}} extracting mechanical energy from the base structure. First, different types of <b>shunt</b> <b>circuits</b> (such as RL series circuit, RL parallel circuit and RL-C circuit), employed in the passive damping arrangement, are analyzed and compared. By using the impedance method, the general modelling of different shunt piezoelectric damping techniques is presented. The piezoelectric shunt circuit can be seen as additional frequency-dependence damping of the system. One of the primary concerns in shunt damping is to choose the optimal parameters for <b>shunt</b> <b>circuits.</b> In past efforts most of the proposed tuning methods were based on modal properties of the structure.

40|$|Masters Research - Master of Engineering (Research) This thesis {{considers}} {{a number of}} related problems {{in the area of}} passive and semi-active vibration control of piezoelectric laminates. The thesis consists of three main parts. The first part of the thesis develops a mathematical model of a physical resonant system-piezoelectric laminated simply supported beam. It is essential to have a good understanding of the physical system so that the associated problems with passive and semi-active shunt damping can be addressed. The second part of the thesis is concerned with problems related with current passive shunt damping techniques using a single piezoelectric laminate. One of the current problems with multiple mode techniques is determining the correct resistive damping for each resonant mode. Therefore, a systematic method is presented for determining the optimal resistance elements by minimizing the H 2 norm of the damped system. After the design process, <b>shunt</b> <b>circuits</b> are normally implemented using discrete resistors, capacitors and virtual inductors (Riordan Gyrators). The difficulty in constructing the <b>shunt</b> <b>circuits</b> and achieving reasonable performance has been an ongoing problem. A new approach to implementing piezoelectric <b>shunt</b> <b>circuits</b> is presented. A “synthetic impedance”, consisting of a voltage controlled current source and digital signal processor (DSP) system, is used to synthesize the terminal impedance of a required shunt network. The third part of the thesis is concerned with the semi-active vibration control of piezoelectric laminated. This part addresses a number of associated problems with the current passive shunt damping schemes. The foremost being the complexity of the <b>shunt</b> <b>circuits</b> required to dampen multiple modes.

40|$|Many {{different}} {{active control}} techniques {{can be used}} to control the vibrations of a mechanical structure: they however require at least a sensitive signal amplifier (for the sensor), a power amplifier (for the actuator) and an analog or digital filter (for the controller). The use of all these electronic devices may be impractical in many applications and has motivated the use of the so-called <b>shunt</b> <b>circuits,</b> in which an electrical circuit is directly connected to a transducer embedded in the structure. The transducer acts as an energy converter: it transforms mechanical (vibrational) energy into electrical energy, which is in turn dissipated in the shunt circuit. No separate sensor is required, and only one, generally simple electronic circuit is used. The stability of the shunted structure is guaranteed if the electric circuit is passive, i. e. if it is made of passive components such as resistors and inductors. This thesis compares the performances of the electric <b>shunt</b> <b>circuits</b> with those of classical active control systems. It successively considers the use of piezoelectric transducers and that of electromagnetic (moving-coil) transducers. In a first part, the different damping techniques are applied on a benchmark truss structure equipped with a piezoelectric stack transducer. A unified formulation is found and experimentally verified for an active control law, the Integral Force Feedback (IFF), and for various passive <b>shunt</b> <b>circuits</b> (resistive and resistive-inductive). The use of an active shunt, namely the negative capacitance, is also investigated in detail. Two different implementations are discussed: they are shown to have very different stability limits and performances. In a second part, vibration isolation with electromagnetic (moving-coil) transducers is introduced. The effects of an inductive-resistive shunt circuit are studied in detail; an equivalent mechanical representation is found. The performances are compared with that of resonant shunts and with that of active isolation with IFF. Next, the construction of a six-axis isolator based on a Stewart Platform is presented: the key parameters and the main limitations of the system are highlighted.

To overcome the problem, a close-box loudspeaker with a <b>shunted</b> <b>circuit</b> is proposed to substitute {{the back wall}} of the cavity of the MPP constructions to constitute a composite absorber. Based on the equivalent circuit model, the acoustic impedance of the shunted loudspeaker is formulated first, then a prediction model of the sound absorption of the MPP backed by shunted loudspeaker is developed by employing the mode solution of a finite size MPP coupled by an air cavity with an impendence back wall. The MPP absorbs mid to high frequency sound, and with properly adjusted electrical parameters of its <b>shunted</b> <b>circuit,</b> the <b>shunted</b> loudspeaker absorbs low frequency sound, so the composite absorber provides a compact solution to broadband sound control. Numerical simulations and experiments are carried out to validate the model...|$|R
40|$|Transformer {{noise is}} mainly {{composed}} by {{the fundamental frequency}} component around 100 Hz and its harmonics. Sometimes {{it is difficult to}} apply traditional sound absorption treatments especially at the fundamental frequency and its second harmonic due to space constraints. Instead of radiating sound, loudspeakers can also be considered as an effective resonant absorber and its absorption performance can be adjusted by employing a <b>shunt</b> <b>circuit</b> at its terminals. This paper introduces a novel loudspeaker absorber with a <b>shunt</b> <b>circuit,</b> which is optimized based on the nonlinear model of the loudspeaker for the transformer noise absorption. Resistances, capacitances and inductances are used to adjust the electrical parameters of the loudspeaker in order to change its acoustic impedance. The proposed absorber shows excellent low frequency absorption performance at the transformer noise frequencies, but is much thinner than the traditional sound absorbers. Numerical simulations and the experiments are carried out to verify its feasibility...|$|R
