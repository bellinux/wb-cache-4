500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, {{a change}} {{occurred}} in Susan's personality. During the surrogacy storyline, viewers saw Susan become the [...] "mother-in-law from hell". Woodbune {{said that it was}} challenging trying to change the character of Susan. During clashes with her son-in-law Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker), Susan was seen becoming controlling and bossy. Woodburne said [...] "As the story progressed it became apparent {{that we were going to}} have to go to the extremes of the less attractive qualities of our characters. We talked about it and decided to go for it – he would be the overbearing husband and Susan the mother-in-law from hell". Woodburne added that Susan is acting out of love for her daughter and for Libby's desire to have a child. In July 2011, Woodburne told a writer for Channel 5 that she still found the role of Susan challenging. She explained that she likes Susan because she adapts well and takes all the things that happen to her in her stride. Woodburne said Karl and Susan are now less naive and exuberant due to the things they have gone through. When asked what the future holds for her character, Woodburne stated [...] "You know, I'm kind of with Susan. I like the Kennedy house when it's full of noisy kids, being naughty and creating havoc. I like it loud and messy. <b>So</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> my hope, that we get a bit of that happening again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Barbara Alyn Woods portrays Deb Scott, Dan's {{wife and}} Nathan's mother. Initially normal, she later becomes neurotic. Woods said, [...] "She's fun to play, I love Deb Scott, she's a well-rounded character. I can't say I'm {{a lot like}} her, but I think our desires are the same. I {{think we want to}} be career women and good moms– I hope I'm a bit more {{successful}} than she is." [...] Explaining their differences, Woods added, [...] "I've never done any drugs in my whole life, I've never even smoked a cigarette– that's where I'd start– lay off the drugs. I'm not a big drinker, so I'd lay off the booze. <b>So,</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a good start for a mom I would say. And I've never cheated on my husband." [...] Seventeen years of marriage to Dan have made Deb bitter, and she divorces him in season 3, her hatred of him once driving her to try to kill him. Deb battles an addiction to pills in season 2 and again in season 4, but overcomes it permanently the second time.|$|E

His wife had now come close to him, and was {{standing}} over him, touching him, so that she also could read the archdeacon's letter. Grace, who was still in front of him, could see the working of {{his face as he}} read it; but even she could not tell whether he was gratified, or offended, or dismayed. When he had got as far as the first offer of the presentation, he ceased reading for a while, and looked round about the room as though lost in thought. [...] "Let me see what further he writes to me," [...] he then said; and after that he continued the letter slowly to the end. [...] "Nay, my child, you were in error in saying that he wrote not about you. 'Tis in writing of you he has put some real heart into his words. He writes as though his home would be welcome to you." ...|$|E

The sleeve notes for Big Beat's retrospective CD of We Five's recordings, released in 2009, contained several reminiscences by Bivens and, on 24 September of that year, she sang High Flying Bird {{at the opening of}} an exhibition, mounted by the Performing Arts Library & Museum in San Francisco, of the rock scene in the Bay area in the mid-1960s to early 1970s. Asked by an ABC reporter if the latter appearance marked a resumption of her singing career, she remarked teasingly, [...] "God, I hope <b>so.</b> <b>That</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> awesome".|$|E
50|$|Greenberg's {{break with}} Orthodox {{theology}} comes with {{his analysis of}} the implications of the Holocaust. He writes that the worst thing that God could do to the Jewish people for failing to follow the law is Holocaust-level devastation, yet this has already occurred. Greenberg is not claiming that God did use the Holocaust to punish Jews; he is just saying that if God chose to do <b>so,</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the worst possible thing. There really is nothing worse that God could do. Therefore, since God cannot punish us any worse than what actually has happened, and since God does not force Jews to follow Jewish law, then we cannot claim that these laws are enforceable on us. Therefore, he argues that the covenant between God and the Jewish people is effectively broken and unenforceable.|$|E
50|$|In {{the renewed}} {{persecution}} of Antipalamites {{that followed the}} condemnation of Demetrios Kydones’ brother, the monk Prochoros, in 1368, Kyparissiotes {{found it necessary to}} flee the country. In 1371 he was living in Cyprus, as is testified by a letter from Demetrios Kydones (ep. 35). From there, he headed further west; records indicate that he travelled with the court of Pope Gregory XI during the latter’s journey from Avignon to Rome (9 November 1376 - 12 December 1377), and received from him a monthly pension. By then, he must have become a Roman Catholic. It is possible, though not certain, that Kyparissiotes is the “good John” of whom Kydones, in another letter (ep. 130), speaks as having returned to Constantinople (1378/79). If <b>so,</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the last piece of information we have about him.|$|E

50|$|Dear Superstar is {{the first}} single of the band from the debut album, Off the Road, written by the vocalist, Erfan Rezayatbakhsh, in form of {{a letter to the}} country-pop superstar, Taylor Swift.The Idea of the song was ignited when Erfan was {{watching}} a documentary about FGM (Female Genital Mutilation) and when he changed the channel there was a video of Taylor Swift in which she was at the same age of the FGM victims he was just watching. According to him, he only wanted to remind Taylor that some of her fans have completely different lives than what she has. <b>So,</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a good idea for the superstar to sing about her living-in-misery fans sometimes.The video of the song was directed by Ali T and shot in Tehran in the last day of 2011.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} Leigh Whannell was asked [...] "If {{there is a}} fourth Insidious film, {{would that be a}} sequel to Chapter 3, another prequel to the original or will it continue in this timeline or go to a whole new timeline?" [...] Whannell stated: [...] "I don't know. I haven't really thought about it yet. But {{for the purposes of this}} interview, I'll say that I'd like to explore the time between this film and the first film. That whole area there where Elise has rediscovered her gift, I think you could have a lot of adventures before she arrives. So I think there is a lot of room there.

50|$|Cao Cao wrote {{a letter}} to Lü Bu, {{explaining}} the perilous situation the latter was in. Lü Bu became afraid and had the intention of surrendering, but Chen Gong felt that Cao Cao's army had travelled a long distance and {{would not be able to}} fight a prolonged battle. Chen Gong advised Lü Bu to garrison part of his forces outside the city, while the rest would remain with him inside, so that they can support each other if either side came under attack. Chen also said the best time to engage Cao Cao's forces would be months later, when Cao's supplies run out. Lü Bu agreed with the plan and wanted to leave Chen Gong and Gao Shun behind to defend Xiapi while he was stationed outside the city. However, Lü Bu's wife claimed that Chen Gong and Gao Shun could not get along with each other, <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a problem if Lü Bu was not around. She also felt that Cao Cao treated Chen Gong better (before the latter's defection to Lü Bu) than how Lü Bu was treating Chen now, so Chen might betray Lü Bu. Lü Bu thus aborted Chen Gong's plan.|$|E

5000|$|Looking back on {{this version}} of the band, Grant Nicholas {{explained}} in an interview with Culture Deluxe, [...] "We {{were going to do it}} so underground, just turning up at venues and not even saying who we were, just doing gigs like any other band do and like we did when we first started. But we felt that by just road testing the new album some of the real diehard fans might feel a little bit left out so we kind of hinted that we were doing this thing but we didn’t say exactly what it was. Some of them got it straight away, [...] "I’m sure they’re just doing this…" [...] but some of them thought we’d split up or it was a new name or I’d done a solo record or whatever but it got people talking and excited and that was kind of the point as well. We didn’t sit down and work out this massive, amazing marketing plan, it wasn’t that calculated but it was just a way of us going back to doing some very small shows away from the usual Feeder thing and not having to play all the usual songs we always have to play. Not that we hate them, it’s just nice to do something different sometimes and be able to play a whole album live, which we haven’t done since our first album. The more albums you do and the more singles you have, that steadily becomes your set and it’s very difficult to get away from that because people go [...] "oh I went to see so and so play and they didn’t play any of the fucking singles", you know it happens and people get pissed off about it <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> the point. It was a bit confusing as there were some gigs where the promoters put Feeder on the bloody tickets so some more mainstream fans turned up and were like [...] "what the fuck’s this?" [...] you know, [...] "where’s [...] "Buck Rogers"?" [...] but that was bound to happen, you can’t keep everyone happy. But we had a great time doing it, it was such good fun".|$|E
