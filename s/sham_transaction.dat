On 4 March 1458, he pledged the castle and lordship of Helfenburk to John Popel of Lobkowicz. Later he sold Helfenburk to Mikuláš Přechov of Čestic, from whom he bought it back when his financial situation had improved. In 1464, he had to sell the town and castle of Rosemberg to John Popel of Lobkowicz. On 31 August 1459, he pledged {{a large part of}} his possessions to his brother Jošt II, though this may have been a <b>sham</b> <b>transaction</b> to confirm the solvency of the Rosenbergs.|$|E
50|$|Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), through nominee Saudi {{businessman}} Ghaith Pharaon became CenTrust's largest shareholder with 28% ownership. Pharaon {{was also}} BCCI's nominee owner of Independence Bank of Los Angeles, {{as well as}} National Bank of Georgia, which was formerly owned by Bert Lance, {{a close friend of}} former United States President Jimmy Carter. Pharaon was indicted in 1991, and again in 1993 under a revised indictment, but remained a fugitive until his death in 2017. The indictments covered the nominee ownerships of the Georgia and Los Angeles banks, as well as his securities trading activities at CenTrust. BCCI had bought $25 million in subordinated debentures out of a $150 million offering in a <b>sham</b> <b>transaction</b> in 1988, with the securities bought back two months later by CenTrust at a loss.|$|E
5000|$|Marleasing SA (the Applicant) {{brought an}} {{application}} before the Spanish national courts for {{an order that}} the contract establishing [...] "La Comercial" [...] was void and that the formation of La Comercial should be nullified {{on the grounds that}} establishment [...] "lacked cause, was a <b>sham</b> <b>transaction</b> and was carried out in order to defraud the creditors of Barviesa (a co-founder of La Comercial)". La Comercial argued that the action should be dismissed in its entirety on the grounds that article 11 of the First Council Directive 68/151/EEC of 9 March 1968 on coordination of safeguards which, {{for the protection of the}} interests of members and others, which had not yet been implemented by Spain, provided an exhaustive list of the cases under which the nullity of a company may be ordered and that [...] "lack of cause" [...] was not a ground listed therein.

Usually institutions hide their gains by <b>sham</b> <b>transactions</b> whose effect evades any tax assessment. In {{response to this}} the Turkish government has developed the concept of thin capitalisation as a check against tax evasion.

The second considers whether a variant notion of sham, often called a pretence, is justified or even necessary...|$|R
40|$|The fate of {{minority}} preference programs {{is one of}} the major civil rights policy questions that will be determined in the 1990 s. The merits of these minority preference programs have become increasingly controversial; debate has raged in the media, in the legislatures, and in the courts. Proponents claim that these policies are responsible for tremendous progress in minority employment and business ownership and therefore are necessary to reverse entrenched patterns of racial discrimination that the marketplace has failed to ameliorate. Critics argue that the programs are overbroad and superfluous since there is no evidence of specific discrimination. They add that the programs benefit only 2 ̆ 2 rich minorities, 2 ̆ 2 and result in <b>sham</b> <b>transactions.</b> Consequently, these critics contend that the programs are ineffective...|$|R
50|$|On February 4, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil {{charges against}} 2 former {{employees}} of Anchor Bay Entertainment, a former subsidiary of Handleman Company. The SEC's complaint, which was {{filed in the}} United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, alleges that the 2 employees caused the company to enter into 2 million-dollar <b>sham</b> <b>transactions.</b> The transactions involved the purported sale of slow moving or obsolete inventory to business partners coupled with secret buy-back provisions. The inventory included worthless video boxes and sleeves and DVDs for films. Handleman subsequently restated its financial statements to correct these accounting errors. Liberty Media, {{the owner of the}} Starz cable network, purchased IDT Entertainment from IDT Corporation in 2006 and renamed it Starz Media.|$|R
40|$|In Stoneridge Investment Partners, LLC v. Scientific-Atlanta, Inc., the Supreme Court {{determined}} that primary liability under section 10 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act {{does not extend}} to third-party actors engaged in <b>sham</b> <b>transactions,</b> even when such transactions have the purpose and effect of deceiving investors. The Court reasoned {{that there is no}} liability when an actor 2 ̆ 7 s deceptive conduct is not communicated directly to investors. This Note argues that the Supreme Court misinterpreted section 10 (b) and Rule 10 b- 5 and that policy considerations weigh in favor of using securities fraud litigation to deter culpable actors. It argues both for the substantial participation standard and the revitalization of scheme liability in order to best comply with the language and policies of section 10 (b) and Rule 10 b- 5...|$|R

Left's initial report focused on an investigation launched by Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Elijah Cummings that examined Valeant's business model of massively spiking the prices of drugs to which it had acquired marketing rights. Left followed up with a report focused on pharmaceutical distributor Philidor RX. Left called for the US Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate the issue and referred to the company as the [...] "Pharmaceutical Enron".

Through a series of <b>sham</b> <b>transactions</b> later found illegal, Miedl acquired title to the J.

40|$|Abuse of law {{in taxes}} - {{abstract}} The author has decided to choose this particular topic as it concerns her occupations as tax advisor. The doctrine of abuse of law is actually becoming more frequent {{not only in the}} tax cases decided by the Court of Justice of the European Union, by the Czech Supreme Administrative Court and lower Czech courts but also often occurs in the regular tax proceeding conducted by all levels of the Czech tax administration. The aim of the author was to analyse the doctrine and try to develop a practical instrument for decision making of common Czech taxpayers. The thesis is decided in two parts and conclusion. In the first part, the doctrine of abuse of law and related concepts as tax avoidance, tax evasion, substance-over-form rule, <b>sham</b> <b>transactions</b> and tax optimization in the Czech law theory and legislation is analysed, in second chapter the author has looked more closely into cases decided by Czech courts. In the third chapter are analysed the most important cases concerning abuse of law decided by the Court of Justice of the European Union. In second part of the thesis are commented some practical measures to avoid harmful tax planning arrangements used as in the Czech republic as abroad, including the recently adopted BEPS Action Plan of OECD which refers to tax planning [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Prohibition {{of abuse}} {{of law is}} a general legal principle. It enables judge not to follow wording of certain {{prohibition}} of law, if he comes to conclusion that the tax subject abuses law contrary to its purpose. As the result, the respective tax subject is not granted with that right. In the Czech Republic this principle can be found mostly {{in the area of}} private law. However it is more controversial in the tax law area, where the principle of abuse of law serves as an instrument for hindering too aggressive tax planning. This thesis deals with the principle from various points of view. After a theoretical introduction it describes evolution of the doctrine in the European law, from where the so callled "two-tier abuse test" was implemented into Czech tax law. Few examples are provided to describe the concept of abuse of law in private law, where this principle forms a subset of conducts contrary to bonos mores. Then the work describes the judicial doctrine of the Supreme Administrative Court in tax matters. Since 2005 the notion of abuse of law has been determined and defined towards other institutes which serve as weapons of Tax Authorities against too aggressive tax planning. These other institutes are <b>sham</b> <b>transactions</b> (dissimulation), tax fraud or even invalidity of the transaction due to non-compliance [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{there is}} a topical {{question}} of legal consolidation in the tax and the customs legislations of the fee for goods purchased from a foreign company through a transaction concluded by the information and telecommunications network "Internet". According to the legislator, such innovations will limit the spillover of online orders to the neighboring states with a high threshold for duty-free shipping, which will strengthen the domestic e-commerce market. The authors believe that the consolidation of the institution in the national legislation would contradict the general provisions of tax legislation. The authors believe that such measures will {{increase the number of}} <b>sham</b> and mock <b>transactions</b> and reduce import turnover. The proposed projects of the European Economic Commission of the European Economic Union on the Internet fees in their structure are poorly written, in particular, they lack the concept of internet purchase, there is no resolution of the issue {{of the relationship between the}} collection and the value added tax. The authors come to the conclusion that these projects should to be completed, in particular, it is proposed to supplement the provisions of domestic legislation, delimiting the object of taxation the value added tax on the object of taxation for cross-border fee to be paid for an online purchase. Their immediate implementation without significant changes will not create a proper mechanism for the implementation of this institution, and generate a lot of conflict situation...|$|R
