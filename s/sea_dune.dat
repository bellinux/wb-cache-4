The results show that both towns were visited by the tourists coming {{from all parts of}} Poland. The travels were most often organized independently by car with accommodation in private rooms and boarding houses. The most attractive elements for tourists in both towns were indicated the elements directly linked with theirs location as <b>sea,</b> <b>dunes,</b> lighthouses, festival and events or pier.

50|$|Overveen {{is a town}} in North Holland in the Netherlands, in the {{municipality}} of Bloemendaal. Overveen lies on the eastern fringe of the North <b>Sea</b> <b>dunes.</b> To the east it borders the built-up areas of Haarlem. A few kilometres {{to the west of}} the town lies the Erebegraafplaats Bloemendaal (Honorary Cemetery), where many Second World War victims have been reburied, including resistance fighter Hannie Schaft, sculptor and resistance leader Gerrit van der Veen, banker and resistance member Walraven van Hall and sculptor and resistance member Johan Limpers. The town is connected to rail service by the Overveen railway station.|$|R
50|$|Only {{one species}} (P. mucronata) reaches north to Egypt and inhabits along the Red <b>Sea</b> coastal <b>dunes</b> and sandy plains with fairly good {{vegetation}} cover.

The regions are not topographically confined, {{resembling}} sand <b>seas.</b> These <b>dunes</b> are interpreted to be longitudinal dunes whose crests are oriented {{parallel to the}} dominant wind direction, which generally indicates west-to-east wind flow. The sand is likely composed of hydrocarbon particles, possibly with some water ice mixed in.|$|R

40|$|Because dunes {{protect a}} large part of The Netherlands against coastal {{flooding}} and inundation, it is vital to guarantee the strength of these natural sea defenses. Besides <b>sea</b> defense, <b>dunes</b> have other functions. Sandy shorelines and dunes are frequently eroded.

40|$|Within coastal systems, {{sand dunes}} {{are the only}} natural {{barriers}} able to counteract erosive processes. Since their equilibrium is often threatened by human activities and high vulnerability of the coastal environment, dunes require increasing attention and specific monitoring. Located between the mainland and the <b>sea,</b> <b>dunes</b> are unique residue habitats for some plant and animal species. In particular, their vegetation {{is important because it}} has a consolidation function and promotes the vertical dune accretion. A georeferenced vegetation classification can be useful to define the advancements or erosion stage of the dune, usually based only on the geometric reconstruction. The proposed study aims to compare the classifications performed with some combinations of two of the last generation sensors and traditional image processing techniques. High spectral resolution satellite image (WorldView- 2) and a multispectral orthophoto, obtained from data acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle, were used. Objects and pixel algorithms were applied and the results were compared by a statistical test. Using the same bands, the findings show that both data are suitable for monitoring the evolutionary dune status. Specifically, the WorldView- 2 pixel-based classification and UAV object-based classification provide the same accurate results...|$|R

50|$|Dekkersduin (or Oostblok) is {{a former}} dune in The Hague, Netherlands. The dune existed in the 19th century at the current {{location}} of the district Duinoord, west of the current Peace Palace and was located roughly 2 kilometers from the <b>sea.</b> The <b>dune</b> was popular amongst landscape painters, such as Jacob Maris and Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch, because it offered a good outlook to the area to produce perspectives.

40|$|The Slufter is an estuary {{located in}} Texel’s North <b>Sea</b> <b>dunes</b> and protects the {{hinterland}} from flooding from the North Sea. As the multi actor {{environment and the}} diversity of values and functions associated with the Slufter are recognized, this research focuses on developing an approach for the district water board to broaden the knowledge base and include stakeholder perspectives. The deepened system understanding is used in a knowledge intervention aimed at enhancing the long-term decision making on the inherently dynamic, coastal nature reserve. Although the knowledge intervention was possibly not as effective as it could have been, {{there are indications that}} synthesized system understanding can be useful in stakeholder settings. In particular, the information derived both from the model and the interviews with stakeholders provides an indication that a shared understanding of the ecological and social functions of the Slufter estuary can be enhanced by integrating a stakeholder approach and problem modeling. Also, practical implications for monitoring the inherently dynamic nature reserve. Further research should be aimed at development and verification the approach in order to have practical value for other projects within and beyond the district water board.

5000|$|The Esk {{continues}} {{past the}} small villages of Boot and Eskdale Green. Just after Boot, the significant tributary of Whillan Beck joins {{the river from}} the north east, the beck being the outflow from Burnmoor Tarn, four km to the north. Continuing in a south westerly direction the Esk flows beneath Hinning House bridge, three km east of Ravenglass, {{at this point the}} river becomes tidal. Shortly after passing the Muncaster Castle Estate the river reaches the Irish Sea at Ravenglass. At its estuary the Esk is joined by the rivers Irt and Mite. The estuary has evolved over the centuries, the Esk and Irt were earlier separated by a shingle bank formed by the <b>sea,</b> <b>dunes</b> were formed when they eventually joined together. The estuary dunes are the location of the Eskmeals nature reserve, a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) over an area of 165.5 acres (67 hectares). The SSSI is made up of mostly coastal dunes and salt marsh attracting breeding birds and a profusion of flowers. The dunes are also the site of the Eskmeals Range, a shooting range owned by the MOD) and operated by the contractor Qinetiq. [...] The estuary is crossed by the Cumbrian Coast Line railway on the Eskmeals viaduct just south of Ravenglass.|$|R
