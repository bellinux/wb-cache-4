5|$|Musculoskeletal {{analysis}} <b>showed</b> <b>significant</b> gender lifestyle variation. Greater leg muscle {{development was}} found in males of the Parc Cwm cromlech, possibly the result of hunting or herding, confirming the sexual dimorphism found in previous analyses of the remains. In contrast, no such variation was noticeable in the remains found during excavations from other nearby sites, for example the Tinkinswood burial chamber, in the Vale of Glamorgan. The variation in musculoskeletal stress markers may indicate a mobile lifestyle {{for at least some}} of the males analysed.|$|E
5|$|The urial (O. vignei) {{was once}} {{thought to have been}} a forebear of {{domestic}} sheep, as they occasionally interbreed with mouflon in the Iranian part of their range. However, the urial, argali (O. ammon), and snow sheep (O. nivicola) have a different number of chromosomes than other Ovis species, making a direct relationship implausible, and phylogenetic studies show no evidence of urial ancestry. Further studies comparing European and Asian breeds of sheep <b>showed</b> <b>significant</b> genetic differences between the two. Two explanations for this phenomenon have been posited. The first explanation is that a currently unknown species or subspecies of wild sheep that contributed to the formation of domestic sheep. The second explanation is that this variation is the result of multiple waves of capture from wild mouflon, similar to the known development of other livestock.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, despite {{changing}} musical trends, Peerson's music <b>showed</b> <b>significant</b> {{roots in}} Renaissance polyphony. However, he was adept {{in the use}} of then-modern compositional procedures; this is evident in his often daring use of chromaticism, especially seen in word painting. Some of his finest music is contained in his set of 15 Latin motets, which was probably composed {{around the turn of the}} century. Existing only in a single copy, it originally consisted of five part-books but the Cantus book is lost. Richard Rastall, professor of historical musicology at the University of Leeds, spent 12 years reconstructing the missing part. The complete Latin motets have been published by Antico Edition, and a recording of their performance by Ex Cathedra entitled Peerson: Latin Motets was produced by Hyperion Records in 2005.|$|E

25|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, {{a number}} of soul groups <b>showed</b> <b>significant</b> {{influence}} from the Temptations, among them the Delfonics, the Chi-Lites, Parliaments, featuring George Clinton, the Dramatics, Daryl Hall & John Oates (from 1965 to 1967 one of Daryl Hall's earliest bands was named the Temptones), and Motown labelmates the Jackson 5 and the Undisputed Truth. These acts and others, showed {{the influence of the}} Temptations in both their vocal performances and their onstage choreography. Several more recent soul and R vocal groups, including New Edition led by Ralph Tresvant, Jodeci, BLACKstreet, Dru Hill, and, most notably, Boyz II Men in the 1990s also <b>showed</b> <b>significant</b> influence from the Temptations.|$|E
