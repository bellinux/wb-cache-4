30|$|To clarify if eye fatigue is lessened {{when looking}} at wood, we carried out {{objective}} examinations using a near-point ruler and also performed <b>sensory</b> <b>evaluations.</b> Visual contact target materials were a white plastic panel, a black plastic panel or a wood panel which had Japanese ash flat grain surface. Each size of the materials was 140  ×  280  mm. Test subjects were 30 undergraduate and graduate students. Each subject’s visual distance to a panel was 40 – 50  cm. The results showed that subjects suffered from more eye fatigue {{when looking at}} white and black plastic panels compared to looking at the wood panel in objective examinations. In <b>sensory</b> <b>evaluations,</b> almost all subjective symptom items for eyes and head progressed when subjects looked at white plastic panel or black plastic panel. However, almost no progression of subjective symptoms was noted when subjects looked at the wood panel.

A total of 39 Hanwoo steers (average age of 22. 2 mo and average body weight (BW) of 552. 2 kg) were randomly divided into Control, rice bran (RB), flax seed (FS), or Sunflower seed (SS) groups. The steers were group fed for 273 d until they reached an average age of 31. 2 mo. Final BW was 768. 2, 785. 8, 786. 2, and 789. 0 kg, and average daily gain was 0. 79, 0. 85, 0. 82, and 0. 84 kg for the Control, RS, FS, and SS groups, respectively (p> 0. 05).

40|$|In sensory {{analysis}} {{a panel of}} trained assessors evaluates a set of samples according to specific sensory descriptors. The training improves objectivity and reliability of assessments. However, there can be individual differences between assessors left after the training that {{should be taken into}} account in the analysis. Monitoring panel performance is then crucial for optimal <b>sensory</b> <b>evaluations.</b> The quality of the results is strongly dependent on the performance of each assessor and of the panel as a whole. The present work proposes to analyze the panel performance within single <b>sensory</b> <b>evaluations</b> and between consecutive evaluations. The basic idea is to use multi-way models to handle the three-way nature of the sensory data. Specifically, a PARAFAC model is used to investigate the panel performance in the single experiment. N-PLS model is used to test the predictive ability of the panel on each experiment. A PARAFAC model is also used for monitoring panel performance over different experiments...|$|R

The following concentration and contact time combinations were used: 0. 005 % SHC for 15 sec, 0. 01 % SHC for 10 sec and 0. 015 % SHC for 5 sec. A total of 80 buffalo offal samples (20 numbers of each kind) were collected from a buffalo offal market and subjected to immersion treatments. Water washed offal pieces were used as controls. <b>Sensory</b> <b>evaluations</b> were conducted using a sensory panel comprising postgraduate students and scientists of Livestock Products Technology division, Indian Veterinary Research Institute (India).

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 This study {{investigated}} {{the ability of a}} portable hand-held electronic nose (EN) to detect spoilage of whole and canned Alaska pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) using ethanol as a spoilage indicator for canned salmon. Fish held in seawater (14 °C) and in slush ice (1 °C) were sampled and canned at various intervals of time up to 3 and 16 days of storage, respectively. The EN measured volatile compounds emanating from the gill and belly cavity of whole fish, in conjunction with sensory and microbial analyses. The EN and <b>sensory</b> <b>evaluations</b> were conducted on the canned products. In addition, static headspace gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was used to quantify ethanol concentrations in canned products. The EN sniffed the belly cavity and distinguished the degrees of spoilage of whole pink salmon with 85 - 92 % correct classification for both storage temperatures. However, the EN was unable to distinguish the spoilage in canned salmon, regardless of original storage temperature. Ethanol concentrations in salmon cans produced from fish stored at 14 °C correlated well with results from <b>sensory</b> <b>evaluations,</b> but this correlation was not observed for fish stored at 1 °C. Ethanol was a suitable quality indicator for canned salmon when raw material had been stored at 14 °C...|$|R

40|$|Usage of {{different}} components {{has been considered}} {{to improve the quality}} and nutritional properties of cakes in recent years. The effects of applying some sweeteners, instead of sugar, have been evaluated in cakes and many bread formulas up to now; but there has not been any research about the usage of by-products of sugar factories such as Wash and Green-A Syrups in cake formulas. In this research, the effects of substituting 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % of sugar with Wash and Green-A Syrups on some dough and cake properties, such as pH, viscosity, density, volume, weight loss, moisture, water activity, texture, staling, color and <b>sensory</b> <b>evaluations,</b> are studied. The results of these experiments showed that the pH values were not significantly different among any of the all cake batters and also most of the cake samples. Although differences among viscosity and specific gravity of all treatments were both significant and insignificant, these two parameters resulted in higher volume in all samples than the blank one. The differences in weight loss, moisture content and water activity of samples were insignificant. Evaluating of texture showed that the softness of most of samples is increased and the staling is decreased. Crumb color and <b>sensory</b> <b>evaluations</b> of samples were also affected by the replacement of sucrose with Wash and Green-A Syrups.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to develop vetch-bovine milk (VBM) pizza cheese low in animal fat and its acceptability was determined through physico-chemical, functional and <b>sensory</b> <b>evaluations.</b> Vetch (Lathyrus sativus) was detoxified by steeping in double its quantity of water for 8 h at 70 °C, changing the water seven times, draining and sun drying. Dried vetch was then treated with water at pH 4. 0 at 90 °C for 60 min to deplete the beany flavour, then dried and milled into fine flour with Quadrumate Senior mill. The seed coat was separated as one of the mill fractions. Four types of VBM blends were prepared from vetch flour and bovine skimmed milk powder and were used to prepare cheese using 2. 5 % lactic acid bacterial culture of Streptococcus thermophillus and Streptococcus bulgaricus and rennet (0. 15 mL L− 1, 1 : 40 ratio with water). The cheese was stored at 4 °C for 14 days and used as topping over the pizza shell. Physico-chemical analyses, such as moisture, total solids, lactose, ash, fat, titratable acidity and pH, and <b>sensory</b> <b>evaluations</b> of both cheese and pizza were carried out at 0 -, 7 - and 14 -day intervals. The stretchability and meltability of cheese increased significantly (P < 0. 05) during storage. Commercial Mozzarella cheese was taken as a control.
