25|$|Researches on the ovine sexually dimorphic nucleus (oSDN) in sheep {{demonstrate}} that the volume of oSDN varies with sexual partner preference in male sheep (rams). Homosexual rams (roughly 8% of the population) {{have been found to}} have oSDNs that are about half the size of those in heterosexual rams. In one study conducted by Roselli, et al., 4 heterosexual rams and 9 homosexual rams were exposed to 2 estrous ewes and 2 rams, with their sexual behaviors (mounts and ejaculations) being recorded. Heterosexual rams displayed significantly more mounts and ejaculations with ewes than with stimulus rams, whereas homosexual rams showed the opposite. Then series of brain sections, including hypothalamic, temporal lobe and diencephalon tissues, were imaged. Also, in situ hybridization was conducted to examine the level of the expression of cytochrome P450 aromatase in these brain sections. The results showed that the volume of oSDN in heterosexual rams is approximately 2 times greater than that in homosexual rams. The number of neurons within oSDN is significantly greater in homosexual rams than in heterosexual rams, <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> the mean length of the oSDN. But the neuron density is similar in both kinds of rams. In addition, aromatase mRNA levels are also tested, showing that the level of aromatase mRNA is significantly greater in heterosexual rams than in homosexual rams.|$|E
500|$|Rasputin's {{friendship}} with the imperial children {{was evident in the}} messages he sent to them. [...] "My Dear Pearl M!" [...] Rasputin wrote the nine-year-old Maria in one telegram in 1908. [...] "Tell me how you talked with the sea, with nature! I miss your simple soul. We will see each other soon! A big kiss." [...] In a second telegram, Rasputin told the child, [...] "My Dear M! My Little Friend! May the Lord help you to carry your cross with wisdom and joy in Christ. This world is like the day, look it's already evening. <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> the cares of the world." [...] In February 1909, Rasputin sent all of the imperial children a telegram, advising them to [...] "Love the whole of God's nature, the whole of His creation in particular this earth. The Mother of God was always occupied with flowers and needlework." ...|$|E
2500|$|These {{definitions}} are qualitative {{in nature}} {{and there is some}} room for interpretation. According to Wolfram, [...] "...with almost any general classification scheme there are inevitably cases which get assigned to one class by one definition and another class by another definition. And <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> cellular automata: there are occasionally rules...that show some features of one class and some of another." [...] Wolfram's classification has been empirically matched to a clustering of the compressed lengths of the outputs of cellular automata.|$|E

2500|$|Basil of Caesarea, in {{his writing}} On the Holy Spirit, says: [...] "The honor paid to the image passes to the prototype". He also {{illustrates}} the concept by saying, [...] "If I point to a statue of Caesar and ask you 'Who is that?', your answer would properly be, 'It is Caesar.' When you say such you do {{not mean that the}} stone itself is Caesar, but rather, the name and honor you ascribe to the statue passes over to the original, the archetype, Caesar himself." [...] <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> an Icon.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first five}} seasons of True Blood {{received}} positive reviews, {{despite the fact}} that initial impressions were mixed. Linda Stasi of the New York Post wrote of the opening episodes: [...] "If HBO's new vampire show is any indication, there would still be countless deaths – especially among vampire hunters and the viewers who love them – because everyone would be dying of boredom. And <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> HBO's new series from death-obsessed Alan Ball, creator of the legendary Six Feet Under, whose new show True Blood, won't so much make your blood run cold as it will leave you cold." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before I {{came to this}} country, and in all {{the time}} I have been here, it has never {{occurred}} to me to think of New York as being beautiful. [...] Therefore all this talk of beautifying New York seems strange to me. If we were discussing Bismarck I might ask five hundred questions about him before I should think of asking whether he was beautiful. ... <b>So</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> New York. We expect of her power and magnificence, but not beauty. If a European came over here and found that New York was beautiful {{in the same way as}} the European cities he knew he would be very much disappointed. I do not see how you can make New York beautiful in that way with the laws and the democratic spirit that you have here [...] The kind of beauty that makes Paris charming can only exist when private rights and personal liberty are or have been trampled on. [...] Only when the mob rules, or where kings rule, so that there is at one time absolutely no respect for the property of the rich and at another time for the rights of the poor can the beauties of Paris be realized.|$|E

2500|$|In a December 2013 article, Pravit {{reminded}} middle-class Bangkok {{opponents of}} the Yingluck Shinawatra regime [...] "that {{that you are not}} the majority of the people, and that Bangkok is just one part of Thailand.... I know that you middle class and well-heeled Bangkokians are used to snapping your fingers and having your maids, drivers, waitresses and even sex workers jump to satisfy you. It must be such a pain to see these people turning the tables and dictating the course of Thai politics.... Some of you say these 'red-shirt buffaloes' are too stupid to be allowed to vote—a privilege that should only go to college-educated Thais or the middle class". He compared this attitude to the apartheid system. [...] "The poor and less-educated Thais in rural areas and in Bangkok want their political opinions counted as well. A lorry with 10 wheels cannot move forward with just one wheel dictating the speed. And <b>so</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> Thailand". He called on his fellow Bangkokians to [...] "try harder to convince them through civil dialogue, rather than engaging in bouts of expletive-loaded hate speech and showing open indifference to loss of life of among protesters who don't share your political opinions. We need to give a space for our fragile and young democracy to grow and mature. And that means employing legitimate democratic means in opposing Thaksin and Yingluck—no military coup and no mob rule, please".|$|E

60|$|The storm {{which was}} coming was already making itself manifest, {{not only in}} the wide scope of nature, but in the hearts and natures of human beings.
