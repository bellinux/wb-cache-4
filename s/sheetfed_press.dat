50|$|A {{business}} card {{can also be}} coated with a UV glossy coat (offset-uv printing). The coat is applied just like another ink using an additional unit on a <b>sheetfed</b> <b>press.</b> That being said, UV coats can also be applied as a spot coating - meaning areas can be coated, and other areas can be left uncoated. This creates additional design potential. UV Coating {{is not to be}} confused with coated stock, which has a gloss or semi gloss finish that is applied before printing.|$|E
50|$|This heat is why press {{temperature}} control systems {{are required to}} allow for the precise control of temperature within the printing unit. The most popular systems use vibrator cooling, in which coolant is pumped through hollow core vibrator rollers in the inker. This type of system has been in use in high speed web presses for many years. The technology has been refined and is now being applied to sheetfed equipment as well. Almost all <b>sheetfed</b> <b>press</b> manufacturers offer hollow core ink vibrators which can then accept the after-market {{temperature control}} systems.|$|E
25|$|<b>Sheetfed</b> <b>presses</b> {{print on}} sheets, have a feeder system {{consisting}} of drawers and/or a pallet of paper, and print {{on both sides}} of the paper (duplex print/perfecter), printed sheets are collected in a stacker mainly for paper printing. Examples of <b>sheetfed</b> <b>presses</b> include the HP Indigo 7900, the HP Indigo 10000 and the new HP Indigo 12000.|$|R
50|$|This single-story plant {{occupied}} {{about seven}} acres and housed composing, preliminary, printing, binding, and mailing operations. The printing plant included several web {{as well as}} large <b>sheetfed</b> <b>presses</b> including a press to apply felt backing to cut-out figures creating flannelgraph sets.|$|R

50|$|Full color cards, or {{cards that}} use many colors, are printed on <b>sheetfed</b> <b>presses</b> as well; however, {{they use the}} CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) four-color {{printing}} process. Screens of each color overprinted on one another create a wide gamut of color. The downside to this printing method is that screened colors if examined closely will reveal tiny dots, whereas spot color cards are printed solid in most cases. Spot colors {{should be used for}} simple cards with line art or non-black type that is smaller than 5 points.|$|R
50|$|The image {{surface of}} a {{waterless}} plate is intaglio (recessed), allowing the plate to carry a greater volume of ink than a conventional plate does and allowing extremely high screen rulings, ranging from 300 to well over 800 lpi. (lines per inch). Waterless printing yields higher ink densities and a broader color spectrum than conventional offset printing does. Waterless plates used on <b>sheetfed</b> <b>presses</b> are commonly rated for runs of 100,000 to 200,000 impressions. The plates designed for use on web-offset presses can yield 300,000 to 500,000 impressions.|$|R
5000|$|... 1995: The LITHOMAN was {{presented}} at drupa with a new press concept for commercial web offset printing. With a host of additional components it can be extended to become a multifunctional production system for all requirements. The first Intranet based remote trouble shooting systems show great cost savings for many customers. At the same drupa show in Düsseldorf, the ROLAND 900, a large-format <b>sheetfed</b> offset <b>press,</b> also made its debut.|$|R
50|$|Depending {{upon the}} type of Toray plate used, run lengths for the plates range from 150,000 to more than 600,000 impressions. These run lengths are based on use with a #1 or #2 coated paper. The use of more {{abrasive}} stocks will significantly reduce maximum run lengths. Toray waterless plates are recyclable and are not differentiated from conventional aluminum plate material in recycling. Toray plates will fit all popular <b>sheetfed</b> and web <b>presses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Two years earlier, in 1871, the two {{engineers}} Louis Faber and Adolf Schleicher {{founded the}} company Faber & Schleicher as an “Association for Production of Automatic Lithographic Presses” in Offenbach am Main. This city {{has played a}} very important part in the history of lithography because it was here that Alois Senefelder built his first lithographic stone presses for the André music publishing company. Faber & Schleicher built their first automatic litho stone press in 1879, the “Albatros”, which had an output of 600 to 700 sheets per hour. Along with the experience and know-how gained from lithography as well as printing on zinc and other metal plates, the real breakthrough came with the emergence of offset printing {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century. The inventors Ira Washington Rubel and Caspar Herrmann took over the indirect printing principle known from printing on metal plate and developed this new process between 1904 and 1907. Faber & Schleicher’s specialization in offset printing began in 1911 with the model “Roland”, the world’s first <b>sheetfed</b> rotary offset <b>press,</b> which was awarded a gold medal at the World Fair in Turin.The name Roland was chosen because [...] "Faber & Schleicher" [...] can hardly be pronounced in English-speaking regions.|$|R
40|$|Dot gain is a {{printing}} characteristic {{which has an}} effect on printing quality, if it is not controlled. It refers to the physical increase in size for a printed dot during the transfer process between the film and the printed sheet. The purpose of this experiment was to determine whether varying squeeze pressure and blanket tension settings significantly affected directional dot gain (slur and doubling), therefore printing quality, using conventional and compressible types of offset lithographic blankets. The experiment was performed on the second unit of a two-color Heidelberg MOZP <b>sheetfed</b> offset lithographic <b>press,</b> bypassing the first unit. Directional dot gain was evaluated by density readings taken from four RIT Experimental Doubling Targets. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine whether statistically significant differences in dot gain values occurred. It was found that squeeze pressure was a significant factor contributing to the magnitude of slur for both types of blankets, while blanket tension was not. The Fisher test determined that each of the squeeze pressure settings (. 006 in. and. 008 in. for conventional blankets,. 006 in. and. 012 in. for compressible blankets) contributed the most towards the difference in dot gain values, while the type of blanket and the different settings of squeeze pressure also contributed to dot gain. Visual examination of the press sheets revealed that directional dot gain occurred at the higher squeeze pressure settings for both conventional and compressible blankets. When both squeeze pressure and blanket tension settings increased, larger dot gain values were detected on conventional blankets. As blanket tension settings increased, dot gain decreased in compressible blankets, since the increased tension decreased the squeeze pressure, by thinning out the blanket. This trend was also noticed on the conventional blankets at the low squeeze pressure setting...|$|R
