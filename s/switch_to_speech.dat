Like that film, it was {{initially}} intended to be a silent film, with the decision to <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> <b>speech</b> made during production. As a result, early scenes feature speech captions and music instead of recorded voices, with character dialogue only appearing towards the end of the film. It is unclear whether it was initially released with sound, with some film historians such as John Huntley claiming it predates Blackmail to be the earliest British sound film. The BFI film database claims that the soundtrack was added in March 1930.|$|E

The user models attempt to capture the interests of a user and link the interests to {{the situation of the}} user. The models are used for making recommendations to applications and services on what might interest the user in her current situation. In the design process we have analyzed several mock-ups of new mobile, context-aware services and applications. The mock-ups spanned rather diverse domains, which helped us to ensure that the system is applicable {{to a wide range of}} tasks, such as modality recommendations (e. g., <b>switching</b> <b>to</b> <b>speech</b> out-put when driving a car), service category recommendations (e. g., journey planners at a bus stop), and recommendations of group members (e. g., people with whom to share a car). The structure of the presented sys-tem is highly modular. First of all, this ensures that the algorithms that are used to build the user models can be easily replaced. Secondly, the modularity makes it easier to evaluate how well different algorithms per...|$|R
5000|$|The Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf was (despite the name) {{the first}} {{international}} conference of deaf educators held in Milan, Italy in 1880.

In the United States of America the speech balloon made his entry in comics with 1895's The Yellow Kid by Richard F. Outcault. Frederick Burr Opper's Happy Hooligan and Alphonse and Gaston further popularized the technique. As speech balloons asked for less text to read and had the advantage of aiding the dialogues directly to the characters who were speaking or thinking it allowed readers to connect better with the stories.

5000|$|The {{first ever}} {{political}} movement in Deaf history happened in 1880 in Milan, Italy and {{was called the}} Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf, although it was actually the very first International Congress on Education of the Deaf.

40|$|A mock trial, with two-way {{consecutive}} interpreting between Cantonese and English, {{was used to}} test perceptions of a court interpreter's neutrality when interpreting into Cantonese in reported rather than direct speech. Monolingual Cantonese speakers played the part of witnesses using the interpreter. Three groups were created: A control group (16 participants), receiving interpretation of all English utterances into Cantonese in direct speech; and two experimental groups (17 participants each). The experimental groups received interpretation with occasional <b>switches</b> <b>to</b> reported <b>speech.</b> These were introduced by third person pronouns (e. g., "he said") for one group (the 'pronoun group'), and by professional titles (e. g., "the judge said") for the other group (the 'title group'). Participants afterwards completed a questionnaire, assessing neutrality and alignment on a 5 -point Likert scale. The title group not only perceived the interpreter to be aligned with the English speakers, but also gave a significantly different assessment of neutrality from the control group. The pronoun group perceived the interpreter to be aligned with them, but did not differ significantly from the control group in their perception of neutrality. Use of pronouns or professional titles in the reporting clauses thus affected the interpreter's perceived neutrality differently. Department of Chinese and Bilingual Studie...|$|R
50|$|As a comic format, text comics rapidly became all but defunct by the mid-1960s, {{the format}} {{lingering}} {{on for a}} little while longer in newspapers (in which the format had blossomed), due to the increasing popularity of speech balloon comics introduced to Dutch readership through post-war Flemish, Franco-Belgian, American and British imports, published in translation in such magazines such as Donald Duck, Sjors, and Pep in particular. Even Dutch mainstays like Marten Toonder and Hans G. Kresse had by the early 1970s <b>switched</b> over <b>to</b> the <b>speech</b> balloon format themselves for their work, including their respective main creations Tom Poes and Eric de Noorman (retitled Erwin, the son of the titular hero, as later series outings increasingly concentrated on him), with which they had achieved fame in the text comic format.|$|R
40|$|Many people {{exposed to}} {{sinewave}} analogues of speech first report hearing them as electronic glissando and, later, when they switch into a dspeech modeT, hearing them as syllables. This perceptual switch modifies their discrimination abilities, enhancing perception of differences that cross phonemic boundaries while diminishing perception of differences within phonemic categories. Using high-density evoked potentials and fMRI in a discrimination paradigm, we studied {{the changes in}} brain activity {{that are related to}} this change in perception. With ERPs, we observed that phonemic coding is faster than acoustic coding: The electrophysiological mismatch response (MMR) occurred earlier for a phonemic change than for an equivalent acoustic change. The MMR topography was also more asymmetric for a phonemic change than for an acoustic change. In fMRI, activations were also significantly asymmetric, favoring the left hemisphere in both perception modes. Furthermore, <b>switching</b> <b>to</b> the <b>speech</b> mode significantly enhanced activation in the posterior parts of the left superior gyrus and sulcus relative to the non-speech mode. When responses to a change of stimulus were studied, a cluster of voxels in the supramarginal gyrus was activated significantly more by a phonemic change than by an acoustic change. These results demonstrate that phoneme perception in adults relies on a specific and highly efficient left-hemispheric network, which can be activated in top-down fashion when processing ambiguous speech/non-speech stimuli...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} indicates that, under explicit instructions {{to listen to}} spoken stimuli or in speech-oriented behavioural tasks, the brain’s responses to senseless pseudowords are larger than those to meaningful words; {{the reverse is true}} in non-attended conditions. These differential responses {{could be used as a}} tool to trace linguistic processes in the brain and their interaction with attention. However, as previous studies relied on explicit instructions to attend or ignore the stimuli, a technique for automatic attention modulation (i. e., not dependent on explicit instruction) would be more advantageous, especially when cooperation with instructions may not be guaranteed (e. g., neurological patients, children etc). Here we present a novel paradigm in which the stimulus context automatically draws attention <b>to</b> <b>speech.</b> In a non-attend passive auditory oddball sequence, rare words and pseudowords were presented among frequent non-speech tones of variable frequency and length. The low percentage of spoken stimuli guarantees an involuntary attention <b>switch</b> <b>to</b> them. The <b>speech</b> stimuli, in turn, could be disambiguated as words or pseudowords only in their end, at the last phoneme, after the attention switch would have already occurred. Our results confirmed that this paradigm can indeed be used to induce automatic shifts of attention to spoken input. At ∼ 250 ms after the stimulus onset, a P 3 a-like neuromagnetic deflection was registered to spoken (but not tone) stimuli indicating an involuntary attention shift. Later, after the word-pseudoword divergence point, we found a larger oddball response to pseudowords than words, best explained by neural processes of lexical search facilitated through increased attention. Furthermore, we demonstrate a breakdown of this orderly pattern of neurocognitive processes as a result of sleep deprivation. The new paradigm may thus be an efficient way to assess language comprehension processes and their dynamic interaction with those of attention allocation. It does it in an automatic and task-free fashion, indicating its potential benefit for assessing uncooperative clinical populations...|$|R
