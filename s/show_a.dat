5|$|Another {{factor that}} fishers select for are forest floors that have {{large amounts of}} coarse woody debris. In western forests, where fire {{regularly}} removes understorey debris, fishers <b>show</b> <b>a</b> preference for riparian woodland habitat. Fishers tend to avoid areas with deep snow. Habitat is also affected by snow compaction and moisture content.|$|E

5|$|Berkshire {{appears to}} have passed from Mercian to West Saxon control during Beorhtwulf's reign. The Welsh are {{recorded}} to have rebelled against Beorhtwulf's successor, Burgred, shortly after Beorhtwulf's death, suggesting that Beorhtwulf had been their overlord. Charters from Beorthwulf's reign <b>show</b> <b>a</b> strained relationship with the church, as Beorhtwulf seized land and subsequently returned it.|$|E

5|$|Canada golden-rod (Solidago canadensis) {{appeared}} in 2003 {{as a result}} of plant deposits. The threat proved to be serious the following year. Some stations <b>show</b> <b>a</b> significant concentration of the species, while isolated plants grow everywhere on the site. This plant is easily pulled by hand before flowering to prevent seed dispersal, and the shoots are burned.|$|E
5|$|Characteristic {{cells with}} an oily content (gloeocystidia) {{are found in}} the hymenium. In Russulaceae, these <b>show</b> <b>a</b> {{positive}} colour reaction when treated with sulfoaldehydes (sulfovanillin is mostly used). They are also present in the hyphal sheath of ectomycorrhizal roots colonised by Russulaceae.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's polonaises <b>show</b> <b>a</b> marked {{advance on}} {{those of his}} Polish {{predecessors}} in the form (who included his teachers Zywny and Elsner). As with the traditional polonaise, Chopin's works are in triple time and typically display a martial rhythm in their melodies, accompaniments and cadences. Unlike most of their precursors, they also require a formidable playing technique.|$|E
50|$|Molls map of 1745 <b>shows</b> <b>a</b> {{dwelling}} at Achincloich (sic) {{lying to}} the east of a small loch, but no castle. Roy's map of 1747 records an Achincloich, not as a castle. Armstrong's map of 1775 <b>shows</b> <b>an</b> Auchencloigh Castle as a ruin. In 1821 the castle is clearly <b>shown</b> as <b>a</b> ruin.

40|$|Hereditary {{hypercoagulability}} {{has been}} identified as risk factor in approximately 30 % of cerebral venous thrombosis cases. We report three females with this association. A 38 years old female with a history of deep venous thrombosis of the lower limb, presented with headache, vomiting and a generalized seizure. Magnetic resonance angiography <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> partial thrombosis of the left lateral and superior longitudinal venous sinuses.

5|$|Final Resolution {{is remembered}} for the TNA debut of Sting, which was ranked as the 2nd {{greatest}} {{moment in the}} company's history due to it marking Sting's return to national television after five years.

5|$|Fossils of {{both the}} Malagasy pygmy {{hippopotamus}} and H. lemerlei <b>show</b> <b>a</b> cursorial adaptation, distinct from the hippos on the African continent, {{and they would have}} been much better runners. This common trait is a possible indicator that both species of Malagasy hippo descended from a common ancestor, and that the similarities to the modern hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus are a case of parallel evolution.|$|E
