40|$|Background: Existence or non-existence {{of adverse}} {{selection}} in insurance market {{is one of}} the important cases that have always been considered by insurers. Adverse selection {{is one of the}} consequences of asymmetric information. Theory of adverse selection states that high-risk individuals demand the insurance service more than low risk individuals do. Methods: The presence of adverse selection in Irans <b>supplementary</b> health <b>insurance</b> market is tested in this paper. The study group consists of 420 practitioner individuals aged 20 to 59. We estimate two logistic regression models {{in order to determine the}} effect of individual's characteristics on decision to purchase health insurance coverage and loss occurrence. Using the correlation between claim occurrence and decision to purchase health insurance, the adverse selection problem in Iranian <b>supplementary</b> health <b>insurance</b> market is examined. Results: Individuals with higher level of education and income level purchase less <b>supplementary</b> health <b>insurance</b> and make fewer claims than others make and there is positive correlation between claim occurrence and decision to purchase <b>supplementary</b> health <b>insurance.</b> Conclusion: Our findings prove the evidence of the presence of adverse selection in Iranian <b>supplementary</b> health <b>insurance</b> market...|$|R

5000|$|Germany has a {{universal}} multi-payer system with two main types of health insurance: [...] "Law-enforced health insurance" [...] (Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung) known as sickness funds [...] "Krankenkasse" [...] and [...] "Private" [...] (Privat Krankenversicherung). Compulsory insurance applies to those below a set income level and is provided through private non-profit [...] "sickness funds" [...] at similar rates for all members, and {{is paid for}} with joint employer-employee contributions. Provider compensation rates are negotiated in complex corporatist social bargaining among specified autonomously organized interest groups (e.g. physicians' associations) {{at the level of}} federal states (Länder). The sickness funds are mandated to provide a wide range of coverage and cannot refuse membership or otherwise discriminate on an actuarial basis. Small numbers of persons are covered by tax-funded government employee insurance or social welfare insurance. Persons with incomes above the prescribed compulsory insurance level may decide to remain in the sickness fund system, which a majority do, or opt out & take private insurance.

40|$|Like {{many other}} countries, the Netherlands has a health {{insurance}} system that combines mandatory basic insurance with voluntary <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance.</b> Both types of insurance are founded on different principles. Since basic and <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> are {{sold by the}} same health insurers, both markets may interact. This paper examines to what extent basic and <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> are linked {{to each other and}} whether these links generate spillover effects of supplementary on basic insurance. Our analysis is based on an investigation into supplementary health insurance contracts, underwriting procedures and annual surveys among 1, 700 - 2, 100 respondents over the period 2006 - 2009. We find that health insurers increasingly use a variety of strategies to enforce a joint purchase of basic and supplementary health insurance. Despite incentives for health insurers to use <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> as a tool for risk selection in basic insurance, we find limited evidence of <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> being used this way. Only a minority of health insurers uses health questionnaires when people apply for supplementary coverage. Nevertheless, we find that an increasing proportion of high-risk individuals believe that insurers would not be willing to offer them another <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> contract. We discuss several strategies to prevent or to counteract the observed negative spillover effects of <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{switching}} behaviour of sickness fund enrollees in the Swiss health insurance system. Even though the new Federal Law on Social Health Insurance (LAMal) was implemented in 1996 to promote competition among health insurers, there still remains large premium variations within cantons. This indicates that competition {{has not been able}} so far to lead to a single price, and reveals some inertia among consumers who seem reluctant to switch to less expensive funds. We investigate one possible barrier to switching behaviour, namely the influence of the <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> on the choice for basic insurance plan in Switzerland, which has not been studied so far. Our aim is to analyse the two decisions (choice of health plan, subscription to <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> contracts). We use the data of the OFAS survey conducted in 2000 on health plan choice and import some additional data on the sickness funds (number of enrollees, premiums). The decision to switch is estimated by both logit and a fixed-effects logit models; two main explanatory variables are studied: premiums (for basic insurance contracts) and <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance.</b> The results suggest that holding a <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> contract substantially decreases the propensity to switch. The switching decision is positively influenced by the expected gain of switching, measured by the premium differential. The expected gain of switching is higher for switchers with no <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> (CHF 19. 44) than for switchers with <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> (CHF 13. 06). The income level has a direct positive influence on the propensity to buy a <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance.</b> This finding suggests that the purchase of <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> is influenced, not only by risk aversion, but also by the willingness to pay for the goods covered by the <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance,</b> which would be higher for rich people. Bad health has a negative influence on the subscription to a supplementary contract, but is no longer significant when the income is introduced into the specification. All the information about health is captured by the income level, a low income being strongly correlated with a bad health status. Income and a <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> contract are observable by the insurance company, and can be used as tools for selection. Health Insurance, Private Sector...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{switching}} behaviour of sickness fund enrolees in the Swiss health insurance system.

This indicates that competition {{has not been able}} so far to lead to a single price, and reveals some inertia among consumers who seem reluctant to switch to less expensive funds. We investigate one possible barrier to switching behaviour, namely the influence of the <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance.</b> Our aim is to analyse two decisions (switching decision in basic insurance, subscription to <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> contracts). We use survey data on health plan choice and import some market data related to the sickness funds (number of enrollees, premiums). The decision to switch and the decision to subscribe to a supplementary contract are estimated both separately and jointly. The results suggest that holding a <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> contract substantially decreases the propensity to switch. However the impact of <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> is not significant when the individual assesses his/her health as "very good"; to the contrary, holding a supplementary contract significantly reduces the propensity to switch when the indivual's subjective health status deteriorates. Futhermore, the switching decision is positively influenced by the expected gain of switching. In comparison with the range of the premium difference, the limitations to switch due to the <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> is moderate, though non negligible. As for the decision to subscribe a supplementary contract, the results show that the income level has a direct positive influence on the propensity to buy a <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance.</b> Our results suggest that a major mechanism is going on in relation to supplementary insurance: holding a supplementary contract might stop individuals from switching when the individual thinks that she/he could be regarded as a bad risk due to the selection practices that are allowed in <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> markets. This result bears major policy implications concerning the regulation of basic and <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> markets. competition in health insurance; switching behaviour; premium convergence; influence of <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{switching}} behaviour of enrolees in the Swiss basic health insurance system. Even though the new Federal Law on Social Health Insurance (LAMal) was implemented in 1996 to promote competition among health insurers in basic insurance, there is limited evidence of premium convergence within cantons. This indicates that competition has not been effective so far, and reveals some inertia among consumers who seem reluctant to switch to less expensive funds. We investigate one possible barrier to switching behaviour, namely the influence of <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance.</b> We use survey data on health plan choice (a sample of 1943 individuals whose switching behaviours were observed between 1997 and 2000) as well as administrative data relative to all insurance companies that operated in the 26 Swiss cantons between 1996 and 2005. The decision to switch and the decision to subscribe to a supplementary contract are jointly estimated. Our findings show that holding a <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> contract substantially decreases the propensity to switch. However, there is no negative impact of <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> on switching when the individual assesses his/her health as 'very good'. Our results give empirical support to one possible mechanism through which <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> might influence switching decisions: given that subscribing to basic and supplementary contracts with two different insurers may induce some administrative costs for the subscriber, holding <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> acts {{as a barrier to}} switch if customers who consider themselves 'bad risks' also believe that insurers reject applications for <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance</b> on these grounds. In comparison with previous research, our main contribution is to offer a possible explanation for consumer inertia. Our analysis illustrates how consumer choice for one's basic health plan interacts with the decision to subscribe to <b>supplementary</b> <b>insurance...</b>|$|E
