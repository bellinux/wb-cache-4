5|$|Another {{option is}} to {{classify}} selection by the life cycle stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or <b>survival)</b> selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of <b>survival,</b> and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given <b>survival.</b> Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and <b>survival</b> selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of <b>survival</b> before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete <b>survival,</b> and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E

The average <b>survival</b> time for limited-stage disease is 20 months, with a five-year <b>survival</b> rate of 20%.|$|E

40|$|<b>Survivals</b> in Legal Culture: Methodological Remarks in the Light of the Remnants of Real Socialism in Polish Private Law The present methodological {{paper has}} three aims. First of all, it puts forward {{the notion of}} a "legal survival" as a methodological tool at the {{interstices}} of comparative legal scholarship, legal history and socio-legal studies. Secondly, on the basis of examples of the legal <b>survivals</b> of real socialism in Polish private law, the paper enquires about the most appropriate methodological approach for analysing legal <b>survivals.</b> Thirdly, it argues that the notion of legal <b>survivals</b> is a particularly useful tool for analysing changes in legal culture following a systemic transformation...|$|R

5|$|Although <b>survival</b> in {{undisturbed}} {{sites is}} high, at 80–90%, the corn crake suffers from modern farming practices, since mechanised mowing can kill 38–95% of chicks {{in a given}} site. The influence of weather on corn crake chick <b>survival</b> is limited: although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother {{for a few days}} until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched {{is more important than the}} weather, with lower <b>survival</b> in large broods.|$|E

5|$|Fewer than 3% {{of people}} live more than {{fourteen}} years. Disease features {{significantly associated with}} reduced <b>survival</b> are an increased severity of cognitive impairment, decreased functional level, history of falls, and disturbances in the neurological examination. Other coincident diseases such as heart problems, diabetes or history of alcohol abuse are also related with shortened <b>survival.</b> While the earlier the age at onset the higher the total <b>survival</b> years, life expectancy is particularly reduced {{when compared to the}} healthy population among those who are younger. Men have a less favourable <b>survival</b> prognosis than women.|$|E

5|$|For {{surgical}} cases, {{the odds}} of cure {{vary depending on the}} tumor location and whether the tumor can be completely, or only partially, removed. Distal cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the common bile duct) are generally treated surgically with a Whipple procedure; long-term <b>survival</b> rates range from 15%–25%, although one series reported a five-year <b>survival</b> of 54% for patients with no involvement of the lymph nodes. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the bile ducts within the liver) are usually treated with partial hepatectomy. Various series have reported <b>survival</b> estimates after surgery ranging from 22%–66%; the outcome may depend on involvement of lymph nodes and completeness of the surgery. Perihilar cholangiocarcinomas (those occurring near where the bile ducts exit the liver) are least likely to be operable. When surgery is possible, they are generally treated with an aggressive approach often including removal of the gallbladder and potentially part of the liver. In patients with operable perihilar tumors, reported 5-year <b>survival</b> rates range from 20%–50%.|$|E
5|$|Giraffes {{have high}} adult <b>survival</b> probability, and an unusually long {{lifespan}} {{compared to other}} ruminants, up to 25 years in the wild. Because of their size, eyesight and powerful kicks, adult giraffes are usually not subject to predation, aside from lions. Giraffes {{are the most common}} prey for the big cats in Kruger National Park. Nile crocodiles can also be a threat to giraffes when they bend down to drink. Calves are much more vulnerable than adults, and are additionally preyed on by leopards, spotted hyenas and wild dogs. A quarter to a half of giraffe calves reach adulthood. Calf <b>survival</b> varies according to the season of birth, with calves born during the dry season having higher <b>survival</b> rates. The local, seasonal presence of large herds of migratory wildebeests and zebras reduces predation pressure on giraffe calves and increases their <b>survival</b> probability.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to endometrial carcinomas, the uncommon endometrial stromal sarcomas are cancers that {{originate in the}} non-glandular connective tissue of the endometrium. They are generally non-aggressive and, if they recur, can take decades. Metastases to the lungs and pelvic or peritoneal cavities are the most frequent. They typically have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. The prognosis for low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma is good, with 60–90% five-year <b>survival.</b> High-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma (HGUS) has a worse prognosis, with high rates of recurrence and 25% five-year <b>survival.</b> HGUS prognosis is dictated by {{whether or not the}} cancer has invaded the arteries and veins. Without vascular invasion, the five-year <b>survival</b> is 83%; it drops to 17% when vascular invasion is observed. Stage I ESS has the best prognosis, with five-year <b>survival</b> of 98% and ten-year <b>survival</b> of 89%. ESS makes up 0.2% of uterine cancers.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{focus has}} been to reduce therapy for low and {{intermediate}} risk neuroblastoma while maintaining <b>survival</b> rates at 90%. A study of 467 intermediate risk patients enrolled in A3961 from 1997 to 2005 confirmed the hypothesis that therapy could be successfully reduced for this risk group. Those with favorable characteristics (tumor grade and response) received four cycles of chemotherapy, and those with unfavorable characteristics received eight cycles, with three-year event free <b>survival</b> and overall <b>survival</b> stable at 90% for the entire cohort.

5000|$|Don Yoder {{argued that}} there were five {{separate}} ways of defining folk religion. The first was a perspective rooted in a cultural evolutionary framework which understood folk religion as representing the <b>survivals</b> of older forms of religion; in this, it would constitute [...] "the <b>survivals,</b> in an official religious context, of beliefs and behavior inherited from earlier stages of the culture's development". This definition would view folk religion in Catholic Europe as the <b>survivals</b> of pre-Christian religion and the folk religion in Protestant Europe as the <b>survivals</b> of Medieval Catholicism. The second definition identified by Yoder was the view that folk religion represented the mixture of an official religion with forms of ethnic religion; this was employed to explain the place of folk religion in the syncretic belief systems of the Americas, where Christianity had blended with the religions of indigenous American and African communities.|$|R
