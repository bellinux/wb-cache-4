They should aim to highlight, on the one hand, the economic potential of geographical areas making up the urban system and secondly to assess development trends you need to focus their own resources {{and those that are}} to be attracted to getting a economic trend upward in that area. It is therefore very important a zonal configuration of the urban system by following the joint capitalization of existing human and material resources, including by building synergy effect to be achieved following the joint evolution of settlements in the US. Along with the development of US is required, from the economical point of view, to implement new forms of economic structures to directly potentate the development of the area through constant cooperation, innovation and transfer of know-how. Romania currently has seven major urban centers that were selected and were assigned the role of growth poles. There were also 13 designated urban growth poles, including Galati and Braila.

40|$|The latest {{recommendations}} {{issued by}} the European Commission go towards the revision of their policy on dissemination and preservation of scientific information: {{the aim is to}} promote access to the results of the community-funded research by especially implementing the open access policy within 2 ̆ 7 Horizon 20202 ̆ 7, the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014 - 2020). The growth of "fast" documentation - which is not long-term preserved or not available in stable URLs and repositories - pushed the European Commission to produce a set of guidelines for the management of documentation at-large and of <b>specialized</b> <b>documentation</b> produced within funded projects in particular. Those guidelines try to conciliate the visibility of the project activities in two directions: "a) better quality and user-friendliness of project websites, triggering higher popolarity b) better visibility for the projects and the European Commission due to a more standardized format". The EC guidelines proved to be a very useful tool for optimizing and handling information on the dedicated portals of the community-funded projects: the general recommendations, for example, focus the attention on the importance of using social media as well as webmaster tools and virtual meeting facilities (as web streaming) and of adopting an "eu" domain. Moreover, specific directives are given not only for the structure of the project homepage but often for the web site framework as well: homepage, project overview, consortium, management structure, scientific methodology and expected documentation. Given this scenario, the web sites of these projects represent an essential vehicle for both the acquisition and the diffusion of grey literature and could also become an important resource within an European infrastructure able to overcome the disconnected and scattered nature of their content in order to optimise their riutilization. Although the term "grey literature" (GL) has never been explicitly mentioned in the Commission guidelines, it is widely known that a good amount of documentation produced within the EC projects is made up of deliverables, e-newsletters, brochures, posters, flyers, videos, project factsheets, photographs. Starting from this condition, this paper analyses the GL production available on European Projects dedicated web sites, using a sample of projects selected from EU-CORDIS. The aim of the survey is then to identify, measure, evaluate the usability and availability of grey literature provided by the European Commission projects web sites in order to verify whether this type of literature is compliant with EU recommendations. It is also important to assess to which extent grey literature is reusable for "nourishing" the European platform infrastructures devoted to the storage, dissemination and conservation of such research product...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{populations of}} the Amazon, from the early eighties of the XXth century, rediscovered the possibility of affirmation of their identity and rights and they have started to fight towards these endeavors. A basic moment of this process was to recognize their socioeconomic and cultural heterogeneity as indigenous remnant people of the communities like Maroons, people living from the land, peasant farmers and small communities living along the Amazon’s rivers. In the search of the recognition of their rights over the lands that they occupy and to the natural resources {{that exist in the}} land itself, they realized that the legislation did not present norms that reflect satisfactorily their experiences of life. Innovative legal instruments are appearing on this regard and they follow the units of conservation of direct use and other modalities of agrarian regulations of agroecological nature. In this perspective, the experience of the people living of the land of the city of Gurupa, state of Para, was researched and it is argued on the basis of qualitative and quantitative evidences produced under an inter-disciplinary orientation, as far as methodology of investigation is concerned. It has also been considered the history and the latest environmental and socio-economic trends referring to the place/region under consideration. This approach implied the use of a set of images of iconographic importance and in the discussion of concepts of traditional populations, sustainable development and public politics. Throughout the thesis, the academic literature, the <b>specialized</b> <b>documentation</b> and the data produced in locus disclose the legal-agrarian problematic among the people living of the land of Gurupa as the central element and, at the same time, it brings together the transformations that are about to affect them. Along these lines, there is a process of occupation of lands permeated by conflicts of interest, abuses and even violence; the present laws which come from the past are full of contradictions. In addition, there is also the existence of documents from registry offices dominated by legal inconsistencies. Facing this situation, these workers and specialists sensible to their cause appear as successful in many issues when demanding from the public authority possibilities that could guarantee legal security to them in view of their remaining lands. As populações tradicionais da Amazônia, a partir da década de oitenta do século passado, redescobriram a possibilidade de afirmação da sua identidade e de seus direitos e passaram a lutar nessas direções. Um momento fundamental neste processo foi o de reconhecer sua heterogeneidade socioeconômica e cultural: povos indígenas, remanescentes das comunidades de quilombos, ribeirinhos, extrativistas, camponeses, pescadores. Na busca do reconhecimento de seus direitos às terras que ocupam e aos recursos naturais nela existentes, constaram que a legislação não apresentava normas que espelhassem a contento suas experiências de vida. Instrumentos jurídicos inovadores surgem nesse contexto, a exemplo das unidades de conservação de uso de direito e de outras modalidades de regularização fundiária de natureza agro-ecológica. Nessa perspectiva, a experiência dos agroextrativistas do município de Gurupá, estado do Pará, foi investigada e é discutida com base em evidências qualitativas e quantitativas produzidas sob uma orientação interdisciplinar quanto à metodologia. Ainda, considerou-se o local/regional a partir da história e das tendências ambientais e socioeconômicas recentes. Essa abordagem implicou em uso de um conjunto de imagens de importância iconográfica e na discussão de conceitos como o de populações tradicionais, desenvolvimento sustentável e política pública. Por sua vez e ao longo da tese, a literatura acadêmica, a documentação especializada e os dados produzidos in lócus revelam a problemática jurídica-fundiária entre ao agroextrativistas gurupaenses com elemento central e ao mesmo tempo aglutinante nas transformações que está a os atingir. Nestes termos, tem-se um processo de ocupação das terras permeado por conflitos de interesses, abusos e mesmo violência, uma lesgilação em vigor ao longo do tempo e plena de contradições, e a existência de registros cartoriais de imóveis dominados por inconsistências jurídicas. Diante disso, esses trabalhadores e especialistas sensíveis a sua causa surgem como vitorioso em muitas questões ao demandarem ao poder público possibilidades que pudessem garantir-lhes segurança jurídica com vistas à permanência na terra...|$|E

40|$|International Service for National Agricultural Research Food {{requirements}} {{in many developing}} countries keep in creasing at unprecedented rates. Consumption patterns change with rapid urbanization and increasing incomes. Agricultural practices, in compatible with growing land scarcity, are causing erosion and soil impoverishment. Drought problems are exacerbated as cultivation moves into less favourable areas Governments must respond to these drastic changes with new and invigorated agricultural policy and development thrusts, and with urgent steps to make new technologies available. No country with a sizeable agricultural sector can meet such needs without an effective agricultural research capacity of its own. This national capacity is needed for several key functions. First, to search the world agricultural knowledge base for suitable technologies, and to collect appropriate germplasm and prototypes. Second, to adapt available technologies to the particular needs of different categories of local producers, and to present such material, techniques, and practices in a form suitable for use by extension. Third, to provide government policy makers and planners with information and insights on what is technically, economically, and socially feasible. And, fourth, within limits imposed by resource constraints, this national capacity is required to generate some essential technology of its own where other options don't work. These are tall assignments, especially for agricultural research systems in developing countries operating under severe institutional, manpower, and funding constraints. It was recognition of the imperative need to have strong, well-managed national agricultural research systems, able to do all these things, that led to the creation in 1980 of ISNAR as the latest of 13 international centers supported by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) As a complement to the predominant emphasis on commodity research within the CGIAR system, ISNAR's task is to assist developing country governments in their efforts to strengthen the organization, management, and structure of their national agricultural research systems. To improve the creative functioning of such a system is a complex managerial task demanding a holistic approach. ISNAR's support is multi-faceted and integrative, taking account of specific country needs. Initial activities are analytical and diagnostic, culminating in recommendations for change, as appropriate. ISNAR has developed a distinct strategy and methodology for carrying out such comprehensive system reviews. To date, it has done nineteen such reviews, at the invitation of and in close collaboration with the governments concerned. The diagnostic review constitutes a first broad and rapid assistance in response to a country's request for guidelines for change, based on the agricultural research management experience of its staff, combined with relevant concepts and methods of management science. Usually, as national research systems evolve, countries seek assistance in solving more specific organization and management problems relating to individual components of their agricultural research systems. Because management as a discipline has been developed primarily for industry and commerce, there is a substantial knowledge gap in applying management techniques to national agricultural research systems. To respond to anticipated and emerging needs, ISNAR is taking on the adaptive research task of bringing modern management concepts and techniques to bear on national agricultural research systems, by distilling, modifying, and synthesizing existing management tools and creating a body of knowledge directly applicable to agricultural research systems. ISNAR's strategy of creating multiplier effects finds further expression in its conference and training activities, aimed at both awareness and skill enhancement and at improving communication among research managers, regionally and nationally. As a support for its own work and that of its clients, ISNAR is rapidly expanding its <b>specialized</b> <b>documentation</b> in research management and agricultural research system development. ISNAR presently has 24 professional staff {{of more than a dozen}} nationalities based in its offices in The Hague, and a few outposted staff. The staff includes economists, agricultural scientists of several disciplines, management experts, and social scientists. More importantly, it comprises a wide diversity of managerial experience, and of cultural backgrounds, all focused on service to, and study of, system-building for effective management of national agricultural research. With this resource, ISNAR is currently working in one form or another and at different levels of intensity with well over twenty developing countries in all parts of the world.

40|$|One often {{hears about}} new plant {{varieties}} that are reputed to make deserts bloom and bank accounts blossom. But such dreams rarely come true {{in the real}} world. Such {{was the case with}} jojoba and guayule, exotic plants which did not fulfil the great expectations which were based on them. That is one reason why more attention is now at last being given to native trees that have already proved their worth. Only a few years ago, jojoba was being promoted by Third World activists and environmentalists as a miracle plant. Considered by some as a 'way to stop desertification' or as 'liquid gold', it was also supposed to save whales from extinction. Such a reputation naturally attracted media attention which made it front page news. Planting jojoba in the Sahel thus became good not only for the Sahel but for the world at large. Some groups or NGOs {{even went so far as}} to adopt it as their main goal. Such enthusiasm was not without foundation as Simmondsia chinensis or jojoba without dou bt has many advantages. This bushy species actually does grow well in very dry areas such as the deserts of Mexico or Arizona, its native region. An annual rainfall of 100 - 500 mm is all it needs to grow. It is resistant to both heat waves and temperatures approaching freezing and demands little in the way of soil fertility as long as it has good drainage. When it is about five years old and three metres high, this undemanding shrub begins to produce pods containing oily seeds. These can be used to produce an oil that is, above all, an excellent lubricant because it keeps its viscosity even at high temperatures. As with the whale oil that is normally used, it performs extremely well in gear boxes and transmissions. There are also other uses in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic and even food industries. Jojoba oil also has the advantage of keeping a long time without going rancid. On the basis of such promising information, many people believed that one only needed to plant jojoba to regenerate the Sahel and thereby increase the incomes of poor farmers and reducing the debts of their countries. Unfortunately, there is often a big difference between what is supposed to happen and what actually happens. To date, not a single jojoba bush has borne fruit in West Africa. It has now been realized that the climate in the Sahel is hardly appropriate for this plant. Trials that were done in Senegal, and repeated in Australia, confirmed that to blossom and produce fruit the jojoba needs winters that are both cool and humid! Furthermore, it responds better to alternating periods of short and long days, preferably with large temperature differences. In other words there are major problems with growing this plant in the Sahel. To add to these biological problems, there are also difficulties in getting farmers to plant jojoba, even along side their food crops. Even if it does grow, it must be protected for several years from livestock (who adore it) before one can hope to reap any benefits. But without fertilizers or irrigation, yields remain very low and quite insufficient to persuade farmers to grow it. After all, they can hardly be expected to include the whale conservation factor in their calculations! Launching grandiose development programs based on jojoba can thus be compared to building castles in the air [...] . On the other hand, it would be unfortunate to abandon jojoba completely. But more detailed studies are needed to determine what can reasonably be expected from growing this crop in Africa. First of all, selection trials are necessary to find productive varieties best adapted to the climates of each region. Attention must also be given to cost-effective production systems that are easy for farmers to develop. For the moment, it is primarily the USA and Israel that are working with experimental plantations but they are limited by high labour costs, particularly of harvesting. Only Latin America currently seems to have all the conditions needed to make jojoba worth growing. Despite these difficulties, the jojoba fad continues to interest people and not a week goes by without a <b>specialized</b> <b>documentation</b> centre receiving a request for information on this plant. In France, a company has even started the in vitro reproduction of jojoba and some farmers in the Mediterranean region have started experimenting with it. Jojoba has thus become the perfect example of one of those plants that economic or political factors have pushed to the forefront as a 'miracle' species before any long-term tests have been done. It was the projected shortage of traditional petroleum-based lubricants that prompted the USA to do research on jojoba in the same way that it was the supply problems of rubber latex during World War II that resulted in research being done on another rubber olant. the auavule. Broken promises The bushy guayule plant, which is native to Latin America, contains latex in its cells rather than in lactiferous channels as is the case with rubber trees. The proportion of rubber compared to the dry weight of the plant ranges from 10 % in wild plants to as high as 25 - 35 % in cultivated plants. To extract it, the plant must be uprooted as it cannot be tapped. As with jojoba, guayule also grows in arid zones. It can survive with 250 mm of rain per year but it grows better with 450 mm. Could guayule be the rubber tree of the desert or the industrial plant that arid regions have yet to find? In northern Cameroon and in Senegal the hopes did not last long. The guayule shoots grew well during the first year or two but then died. They needed a cold winter which is difficult to reproduce in the southern Sahara. On the other hand, the Morrocan climate seems more promising and an experimental plantation of 40 hectares has been established. Generally speaking, these American species have not lived up to expectations in crossing the Atlantic. Adapting plants to new climates is no easy task and certainly cannot be done as rapidly as one often thinks. The American continent has already provided many useful species to Africa, such as maize and cacao, but many years were needed to ensure the adaptation and distribution of such crops. While the future potential of so-called miracle plants deserves attention, they should not be considered as overnight solutions to already pressing problems. Unfortunately, common African plants have attracted very little mei die attention. The disappointment caused by the failure of introduced species and a better evaluation of the conditions needed for development, however, have provoked new interest in the potential of trees that have been firmly rooted in African soil for centuries. Physic nut, Jatropha curcas L. which grows throughout the tropics has recently emerged from the shadows. This hardy tree stands up well to droughts and poor soils. It is traditionally grown in hedges (because animals avoid it), cut for fuel wood, or used for its many medicinal qualities well known to local people. Above all, physic nut produces oilrich seeds for about 50 years once it is established after four or five years of growth. Until the last World War, this oil was used to make laundry soap and candles. Studies also showed that it could be used to fuel diesel engines. But the development of the petroleum industry soon dissipated what limited interest had been shown in this little tree found in arid zones. The oil crisis, however, sparked new interest in this plant. Recent studies have confirmed old data: physic nut oil can, without any special treatment, replace diesel oil in small motors. The fuel consumption is somewhat higher but the power generated is about the same. This local energy source could be very useful in fuelling pumps, mills and small agricultural motors. It is easy to produce as the physic nut grows readily and its oil can be extracted without any major problems. Small processing units can even be established at the village level. This multipurpose tree has thus many advantages for farmers. Those in Cape Verde were among the first to recognize its value and to start growing it. On plots abandoned for growing annual crops, more than 100, 000 physic nut seedlings are being planted. They act as wind breaks, help prevent soil erosion and increase the water retention capacity of the soil. Periodic trimming also generates a supply of fuel wood. But it is the projected production of soap and fuel that prompted people to invest in this crop. Part of the oil will eventually enable the production of 4. 5 t of soap per year, enough to satisfy the demands of about 120 families. Another part will fuel the 22 kw motor powering the semi-industrial processing equipment. The rest will be used to fuel a generator capable of providing the basic electricity needs of an entire village. It could also be used in homes to reduce fuel wood consumption and to replace the lamp oil used for lighting. Such developments have already begun and the first results are encouraging. By exploiting it in this way, physic nut can become an inexpensive and easily integrated tool for local development, particularly for promoting small industry. To optimize its potential, research remains to be done on selecting more productive varieties, developing better cultivation techniques and experimenting with simple yet efficient processing systems. The gum tree The gum acacia, familiar to people in the Sahel, is also benefiting from a revived and long overdue attention. Growing throughout the Sudan-Saharan region, this multi-purpose tree joined the ranks of others that, weakened by droughts and overcutting, slowly disappeared from the landscape. About 4 - 6 m tall, this thorny tree is specially known for its golden pink excretions, the famous Arabic gum. But it is also a source of forage favoured by livestock and a hard wood which makes excellent charcoal. Finally, it helps to retain soil moisture thanks to its well developed root system and, as with all leguminous plants, it fixes atmospheric nitrogen and thereby increases soil fertility. The orchards of gum acacia in the Sudan now provide most of the world's gum, which is used primarily in the drug and confectionery industry. In Kordofan, the trees are harvested from seven to 12 years before being pruned. During the four or five years that it takes for them to return to production, food crops are interplanted between the trees. In West Africa, production has become very limited despite the high prices paid (1000 CFA per kg for the harvesters). In Mauritania, production plummeted from 6000 - 8000 t per year in 1972 to 150 t in 1986. And this despite the fact that demand greatly exceeds supply on the international market. To respond to this situation, numerous projects have recently been started. The regeneration of old gum plantations has already begun in Senegal, Mauritania, Mali and Niger. Experiments are also being conducted with village plantations using unproven varieties that are both more productive and more resistant to drought. These plantations, however, require careful maintenance, especially during the first few years. The young trees must be protected from animals by wire fences or thorn hedges and watered during a year or two to ensure their establishment. Finally work is needed on ways of improving the traditional tapping methods which often kill the tree by removing two or three metres of bark with one swipe of a machete. Training must, of course, be an integral part of such programmes. By returning the gum acacia to its former glory, one would also reduce the stress on the Sahelian ecosystem and favourize a cash crop that has little competition on the international market. Other plants that have long been part of the African landscape and its local economies can, if favourized play a significant role in the development of such areas. The often forgotten shea butter tree for example, is the third export crop of Senegal but it receives virtually no research attention. This despite the fact that its nuts have always been collected by women and transformed into butter. This is the same product that eventually reaches the cosmetic counters of European stores where it is bought by people with delicate skin! The list of these trees and other plants that are poorly known by researchers and development workers is very long: the neem tree with its insecticidal powers; Acacia albida which helps to regenerate soils; the kenaf which can be used for paper production and the many other trees that provide highly appreciated food products. The list of potential uses is also very long. From domestic facilities up to export products, the diverse potential of these numerous local plants merits much more attention. This opportunity is actually more valuable in the short term than the development of exotic species brought in from other countries, if not continents. While the latter may have some remarkable points in their favour, their ecological and social integration often poses many difficult problems that soon cause their miraculous reputations to be forgotten.

This paper presents a macroeconomic model to quantify intangible assets during 1991 - 2009. The model can be used to develop forecasts for the next period...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the paper is to present a {{methodology}} that can be helpful to identify knowledge networks or knowledge communities {{and its relation to}} the formal organization. The methodology is used in a case study that is based on a multi-method approach applying both qualitative techniques, such as interviews observations and document analysis as well as quantitative techniques, namely statistical analysis of survey responses as well as social network analysis. The research was conducted at a Dutch research institute <b>specialized</b> in <b>documentation</b> of historic documents. All employees have their offices in the same building and at the same floor. Work is divided formally over seven research programmes related to a certain time period in the Dutch History (e. g. Middle Ages, 17 th century, WO II) each consisting of yet smaller research projects. We found that the informal knowledge networks only to a small extent differ from the formal work units. In the discussion of this paper, we will elaborate on the method and its implications. ...|$|R

40|$|Museum {{documentation}} can {{be distinguished}} into administrative and cultural. In the first case, the interest is focused on administrative information, regarding the conservation {{and control of the}} state and position of objects, as well as the organization of exhibitions, while in the second on historical and cultural information, regarding the creation. technique, style, etc., of objects, as well as relationships with other objects, persons and historical events. This thesis is about CLIO, a cultural documentation system. CLIO is used as a scientific catalog and can include all the information which constitutes the current knowledge about a group of objects organized by collections or by subject. The information consists of structured descriptions organized in a knowledge base according to a semantic ontological model, implemented in the TELOS language, and multimedia data (images, sound, text). The CLIO ontology includes notions of matter, location, occurrence, measurement, mankind, conceptual creation and naming, and their interrelationships. During the model development we dealt with specific problems of representation of space and time, spatial and temporal relationships, measurement, part and membership relations, ambiguity and contradiction of the existing information, description of default attributes, names and synonyms, nd indication of the source of historical information. To illustrate its application, the basic model was <b>specialized</b> for the <b>documentation</b> of Cretan and Byzantine Pots and of Greek folk garments from the collection of the Historical Museum of Crete. The operational kernel of CLIO is the Semantic Index System (SIS), developed at the Institute of Computer Science, Foundation of Research and Technology-Hellas, in order to enhance the efficiency of user dialogs of CLIO, a set of predefined queries was developed, taking into consideration the basic notions and their interrelationships. The queries are <b>specialized</b> for cultural <b>documentation,</b> yet general enough to be used in both demonstrator applications. An important problem, which was studied, is view definition in a semantic data model. A view mechanism consists in presenting an abstraction or part of the schema or the data. A survey of models concerning grouping and abstract representation of entities, as well suggestions for the design of a view mechanism for CLIO are given...|$|R
40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Development, considered as socio-economic growth and prosperity, represents today the paramount goal of all nations. Many countries regard national development plans as the main tool for programming and accelerating development planning. Information {{plays an important role}} in this. Development planning needs a <b>specialized</b> information and <b>documentation</b> service which, if adequately organized, could facilitate and improve the quality of development planning. The main goals of this research were to gain a comprehensive understanding of development planning information needs, to investigate the role of a <b>documentation</b> centre <b>specialized</b> in development planning, and to find the way for improving the necessary information and documentation base for more efficient development planning. The study was based on the Development Documentation Centre in Sierra Leone. The main characteristics of development planning process in this West African Country and its corresponding information needs were examined and elaborated. An emphasis was put on the role of Development Documentation Centre in meeting the specific information and documentation needs of development planners in the Ministry of National Development and Economic Planning in Sierra Leone. This is a case study based on the experience of one country. However, similarity of living and working conditions with other developing countries allows that conclusions drawn here could have some wider implications...|$|R
40|$|Tools {{are needed}} to support the {{continuous}} and efficient shared understanding of a patient’s care history that simultaneously aids sound intra- and interdisciplinary communication and decisionmaking about the patient’s future care. Such tools are vital {{to ensure that the}} continuity, safety, and quality of care endure across the multiple handovers made by the many clinicians involved in a patient’s care. A primary purpose of documentation and recordkeeping systems is to facilitate information flow that supports the continuity, quality, and safety of care. Since recordkeeping systems serve multiple purposes (e. g., legal requirements, accreditation, accountability, financial billing, and others), a tension has arisen and is undermining {{the primary purpose of the}} record and instead fueling discontinuity of care, near-misses, and errors. Among the more <b>specialized</b> types of <b>documentation</b> is the plan of care, a requirement of the Joint Commission. 1, 2 Though planning and plans should facilitate information flow across clinician providers there is little generalizable evidence about their effectiveness. In the first part of this chapter, evidence from studies on nursing documentation, care plans, and interdisciplinary plans of care is presented and synthesized into a framework for the Handson Automated Nursing Data System (HANDS) method. The method is an intervention that addresses the need for broad-based standardization of key aspects of documentation and communication to facilitate patient-centric information flow. HANDS standardizes the plan of care documentation and processes by replacing the current widely variable forms. It supports interdisciplinary decisionmaking that is based on the shared knowledge from clinicians. Finally, a case study presenting the history and future plans for the ongoing refinement of the HANDS method is presented...|$|R
40|$|The BIDS (Digital Library of “La Sapienza” project-service) was {{established}} in the “La Sapienza” University of Rome in 1999. Its first year of life saw the acquisition of 10 data bases and the stipulation of the first large consortium contract with a large electronic periodicals' publisher (Elsevier). The project has gradually grown to include today about 90 data bases and over 15, 000 electronic periodicals. Among those first ten electronic data bases was the Web of science, the data base produced by the ISI, Institute for Scientific Information. At the time the Web of science (WoS) was the only source that apart from providing a rich bibliographic data base, also functioned as a tool of citation indexing, very much appreciated by academic users. In 2004 Elsevier proposed that we try the new Scopus database, without any costs or commitments on our part. This was not because the digital Library needed a new multidisciplinary database, but because we needed a new updated citation indexing tool. The first comparative analysis that we did therefore was on the number of periodicals examined by Scopus, to see if, on the basis of this, it were not perhaps possible to eliminate some of the disciplinary data bases to which we were subscribing. In the meantime, November 2004 saw the appearance of Google scholar, the new Google motor for academic research. It was not the first example of this kind (we must at least mention the sectorial experience of Citeseer and that of Scirus, the research engine <b>specialized</b> in scientific <b>documentation,</b> this too produced by Elsevier, and inserted into Scopus) : but the popularity, authoritativeness and ambition of Google's project immediately made it a truly fearful competitor. Thus, in the space of two months, WoS found itself face to face with not one, but two competitors, one of which moreover free of charge. An investigation was therefore carried out, not to evaluate the superiority of one database over another (to do this one would have to carefully cross-examine all the comparative bibliography that is appearing with a certain regularity in recent months); but rather to help us see how these tools, even though powerful and with results that are overall more than satisfactory, cannot guarantee uniformity, consistency, real trustworthiness. The entrance in the market (or in the free territory of the net that is open to everyone, {{as in the case of}} Google) of new actors results in highlighting the gaps in a citation index, no matter what agency carries out the survey, so warning users of its inevitable lack of precision. And this process of relativization of automatic indexing mechanisms (so important especially in defining academic careers) should be considered, at least at awareness level, as a very positive result...|$|R
