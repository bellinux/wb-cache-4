It is about the humans and animals who live and die in the organization - often silenced and hidden in society. Employees join the organization to save animals, yet due to organizational constraints, {{are the ones who are}} tasked with the killing. In ANIMA, the emotional and moral conflict is both constant and intense for animal shelter employees. They are promotivated and have strong ideological alignment to the organizational goals. This creates a lifestyle that revolves around saving and caring for the neglected, unwanted and mistreated animals of society. However, management and the animal shelter employees are at odds on how to best handle the social problem of pet overpopulation. The organization rests upon a traditional hierarchical power distribution where those who perform the <b>stigmatized</b> <b>job</b> task of euthanasia are also those without any real decision-making power. Reducing the animal shelter workers to assembly-line workers in a processing-plant is a key way to ensure the business model of the animal welfare organization flows smoothly. I was employed for a year as an animal attendant in the animal shelter. My ethnographic material includes diary entries, interviews, participant-observations and are represented in my thesis through Crystallization. It is through this unusual form of communication that I use poetry, pictures and narratives to try to engage the reader to understand the unique, emotive context of the organization. In this book, I specifically focus on the paradoxical work role that includes euthanasia of healthy animals; how the hidden voices of the animals give knowledge of the organization; and how power relationships are revealed during emergency evacuation during a natural disaster. The study argues that there are immense problems, both at an organizational as well as broader societal level, of how unwanted animals are dealt with. The focus of powerlessness felt by employees and animals leads to four coping mechanisms throughout the study which I call: Hero, Victim, Professional and Tourist. I make contributions to literatures on Emotion in Organizations, Dirty Work and Positive Organizational Scholarship...|$|E
5000|$|The {{implications}} are multiple as various research traditions are now heavily utilizing {{the lens of}} identity to examine phenomena. One implication of identity and of identity construction {{can be seen in}} occupational settings. This becomes increasing challenging in <b>stigmatized</b> <b>jobs</b> or [...] "dirty work" [...] (Hughes, 1951). Tracy and Trethewey (2005) state that [...] "individuals gravitate toward and turn away from particular jobs depending in part, {{on the extent to which}} they validate a [...] "preferred organizational self" [...] Some jobs carry different stigmas or acclaims. In her analysis Tracy uses the example of correctional officers trying to shake the stigma of [...] "glorified maids" [...] [...] "The process by which people arrive at justifications of and values for various occupational choices." [...] Among these are workplace satisfaction and overall quality of life [...] People in these types of jobs are forced to find ways in order to create an identity they can live with. [...] "Crafting a positive sense of self at work is more challenging when one's work is considered [...] "dirty" [...] by societal standards" [...] [...] "In other words, doing taint management is not just about allowing the employee to feel good in that job. [...] "If employees must navigate discourses that question the viability of their work, and/ or experience obstacles in managing taint through transforming dirty work into a badge of honor, it is likely they will find blaming the client to be an efficacious route in affirming their identity" [...]|$|R

The job as parking attendant is – just as many other jobs in the public sector – the object of changing management strategies according to changing political agendas. Meanwhile, the job is also a psychologically demanding and <b>stigmatized</b> unskilled <b>job</b> in the public sector. The dissertation analyzes how parking attendants, whose job is increasingly professionalized, interact with changing management strategies by for instance resisting or avoiding them. The dissertation relies on sociological fieldwork among parking attendants and their managers. The fieldwork included shadowings of daily work, interviews, gathering of documents and participant observation at job-interviews. The analytical point of departure for the dissertation is Ian Hacking and Paul du Gay’s theories of how identities are ‘made up’. This sort of analysis is coupled in three articles in the dissertation to other perspectives on the relation between work and identity. These are about how employees handle stigma, which is considered in research on ”Dirty Work”, about how managers and employees draw upon ”aesthetic labour” to meet the public’s scepticism and as a means to bring down the number of assaults and finally how managememt strategies aiming at creating inclusion and diversity contribute to the making up of the parking attendant. All three analysis contribute to expand our understanding of work and identity in the public sector...|$|R
