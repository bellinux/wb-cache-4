Many hundreds of strains are maintained, and over 400 Mendelian mutations have been described. Another source suggests 1,000 inbred domesticated strains are kept worldwide. One useful development for the silk industry is silkworms that can feed on food other than mulberry leaves, including an artificial diet. Research on the genome also raises the possibility of genetically engineering silkworms to produce proteins, including pharmacological drugs, in the place of silk proteins.

2500|$|The {{formation}} of a bivalent occurs during the first division of meiosis (in the pachynema stage of meiotic prophase 1). In most organisms, each replicated chromosome (composed of two identical sister chromatids) elicits {{formation of}} DNA double-strand breaks during the leptotene phase. These breaks are repaired by homologous recombination, that uses the homologous chromosome as a template for repair. The search for the homologous target, helped by numerous proteins collectively referred as the <b>synaptonemal</b> <b>complex,</b> cause the two homologs to pair, between the leptotene and the pachytene phases of meiosis I.

40|$|For {{the first}} time in the {{domestic}} pig, meiotic recombination along the 18 porcine autosomes was directly studied by immunolocalization of MLH 1 protein. In total, 7, 848 <b>synaptonemal</b> <b>complexes</b> from 436 spermatocytes were analyzed, and 13, 969 recombination sites were mapped. Individual chromosomes for 113 of the 436 cells (representing 2, 034 <b>synaptonemal</b> <b>complexes)</b> were identified by immunostaining and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The average total length of autosomal <b>synaptonemal</b> <b>complexes</b> per cell was 190. 3 µm, with 32. 0 recombination sites (crossovers), on average, per cell. The number of crossovers and the lengths of the autosomal <b>synaptonemal</b> <b>complexes</b> showed significant intra- (i. e. between cells) and inter-individual variations. The distributions of recombination sites within each chromosomal category were similar: crossovers in metacentric and submetacentric chromosomes were concentrated in the telomeric regions of the p- and q-arms, whereas two hotspots were located near the centromere and in the telomeric region of acrocentrics. Lack of MLH 1 foci was mainly observed in the smaller chromosomes, particularly chromosome 18 (SSC 18) and the sex chromosomes.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the identification of}} two major components of the lateral elements of <b>synaptonemal</b> <b>complexes</b> of the rat by immunocytochemical techniques. We prepared monoclonal antibodies against <b>synaptonemal</b> <b>complexes</b> (SCs) by immunization of mice with purified SCs. One of these antibodies, II 52 F 10, reacts with a 30 and a 33 kDa polypeptide, which are major components of purified SCs. Using this antibody, we studied the localization of its antigens light microscopically, {{by means of the}} indirect immunoperoxidase technique, as well as ultrastructurally, by means of the immunogold labeling technique. The immunolocalization was carried out on whole-mount preparations of lysed spermatocytes. The antibody reacts with paired as well as unpaired segments of zygotene, pachytene and diplotene SCs. In light microscopic preparations, the attachment plaques, particularly those of late pachytene and diplotene SCs, also appear to react strongly. In electron micrographs the lateral elements in paired as well as unpaired segments could be seen to react. No reaction was observed in the attachment plaques; however, in late pachytene and diplotene SCs the swollen terminal segments of the lateral elements did react with the antibody. Thus, we conclude that a 30 and a 33 kDa polypeptide make part of the lateral elements of <b>synaptonemal</b> <b>complexes</b> of the ra...|$|R

5000|$|Synapsis (also called syndesis) is the {{pairing of}} two {{homologous}} chromosomes that occurs during meiosis. It allows matching-up of homologous pairs {{prior to their}} segregation, and possible chromosomal crossover between them. Synapsis takes place during prophase I of meiosis. When homologous chromosomes synapse, their ends are first attached to the nuclear envelope. These end-membrane complexes then migrate, assisted by the extranuclear cytoskeleton, until matching ends have been paired. Then the intervening regions of the chromosome are brought together, and may be connected by a protein-RNA complex called the <b>synaptonemal</b> <b>complex.</b> Autosomes undergo synapsis during meiosis, and are held together by a protein complex along the whole length of the chromosomes called the <b>synaptonemal</b> <b>complex.</b> Sex chromosomes also undergo synapsis; however, the synaptonemal protein complex that holds the homologous chromosomes together is only present {{at one end of}} each sex chromosome.|$|E

50|$|In {{prophase}} I of meiosis I, each chromosome is {{aligned with}} its homologous partner and pairs completely. In prophase I, the DNA has already undergone replication so each chromosome {{consists of two}} identical chromatids connected by a common centromere. During the zygotene stage of prophase I, the homologous chromosomes pair up with each other. This pairing occurs by a synapsis process where the <b>synaptonemal</b> <b>complex</b> - a protein scaffold - is assembled and joins the homologous chromosomes along their lengths. Cohesin crosslinking occurs between the homologous chromosomes and helps them resist being pulled apart until anaphase. Genetic crossing over occurs during the pachytene stage of prophase I. In this process, genes are exchanged by the breaking and union of homologous portions of the chromosomes’ lengths. Structures called chiasmata are {{the site of the}} exchange. Chiasmata physically link the homologous chromosomes once crossing over occurs and throughout the process of chromosomal segregation during meiosis.

We have analyzed the distribution of such foci along meiotic prophase chromosomes of the mouse {{to find out when}} interference is imposed and whether interference manifests itself at a constant level during meiosis. We observed strong interference among MLH 1 foci, which mark CO positions in pachytene. Additionally, we detected substantial interference well before this point, in late zygotene, among MSH 4 foci, and similarly, among replication protein A (RPA) foci. MSH 4 foci and RPA foci both mark interhomolog recombinational interactions, most of which do not yield COs in the mouse.
