Lustick argues that Lijphart has [...] "an impressionistic methodological posture, flexible rules for coding data, and an indefatigable, rhetorically seductive commitment to promoting consociationalism as a widely applicable principle of political engineering", that results in him applying consociational theory to case studies that it does not fit.

40|$|In {{the target}} paper, Wilding (2005) lists {{concerns}} about measures {{of attention and}} control that are used throughout the field of clinical developmental psychology. In particular, doubts are raised about {{the construct validity of}} the measures of attention that led Manly et al. (2001) to conclude that sustained attention is deficient in ADHD whereas selective attention is not. We support the criticism, but argue that Wilding’s suggestion that executive dysfunction is the fundamental problem underlying ADHD symptoms does not bring us much closer to understanding ADHD. We illustrate this by evaluating the more <b>specified</b> <b>claim</b> that inhibitory deficiencies are the fundamental problem underlying ADHD. Wilding makes the interesting observation about Manly et al. ’s (2001) and other studies that whether or not a difference is observed between children with ADHD and controls depends on whether the dependent variable is speed or accuracy, and which of these is emphasized in the instruction. Children with ADHD display attentional deficiencies in the form of reduced accuracy and sensitivity to interference, rather than by speed measures such as search time. Wilding attributes the accuracy difference...|$|E

40|$|Classical {{credibility}} models {{provide for}} predictive claims in linear form. For example, the Bühlmann and the Bühlmann-Straub credibility models express the next period’s claim as a weighted average of historical claims arising from each group’s own {{experience and the}} entire portfolio’s experience. The weight that {{is attached to the}} own experience reflects a credibility factor. These clas-sical models typically assume claim independence. In this paper, we extend the notion of predicting the next period’s claims by relaxing these indepen-dence assumptions.

This paper extends the models offered by Frees and Wang (2005) and Yeo and Valdez (2004) that respectively used the frameworks of copula models and common effects. Here in this paper, we find that the pre-dictive claim can be expressed as an expectation under a change of probability measure which reflects the ratio of the densities of the copulas relating to the historical claims. We examine this expectation for different families of copulas and in several instances, we find we are able to explicitly express the predictive claim in terms of historical claims. As we suspect, these predictive claims are no longer linear in form. ∗Keywords: claim dependence, insurance premium, credibility models, and copula...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with three different topics, {{each of which is}} treated in a separate, self-contained article. Their underlying connection is contained in the quote above, as they apply the methods of social science – mi- croeconomic theory and micro-econometrics – to questions related to “grown”, or in one case “growing” institutions. In Chapter 2, I address troubles that patent systems are facing to a large and increasing degree, such as the deval- uation of patents due to badly <b>specified</b> <b>claims</b> and property rights and the ensuing central role that courts play in the patent system {{in the context of a}} game-theoretic model. While the patent system can be considered a venerable institution, in Chapter 3 I turn my attention to a young and budding one: Online social networks. Making use of a unique data set, in collaboration with Steffen Reik I try to explore whether the existing economic theory on social networks can assist us in understanding the forces that shape user behavior within. One of the central findings is the importance of social norms in this en- vironment. In Chapter 4, which was developed working together with Leonardo Felli and Konrad Stahl, the aim is to show how a specific social norm, trust, shapes the interaction between upstream suppliers and downstream manufac- turers in the automotive industry. I present a game-theoretic model and test its predictions using data from an extensive industry survey we conducted...|$|R
