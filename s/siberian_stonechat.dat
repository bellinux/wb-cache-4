500|$|A {{review of}} semipalmated sandpiper records {{took place in}} the 1970s, {{resulting}} in seven of the twelve records being rejected. A review of black-headed wagtail records was initiated in 1983. The results were published in 1994 and 1995, and nine previously accepted records were judged to be unsound, due to possible confusion with grey-headed wagtail. A review of rufous turtle dove records took place in 1994, and concluded that three of the eight accepted records should no longer stand. A review of lesser kestrel records, begun in 1994, and completed in 1995, concluded that six accepted records of this species should no longer be regarded as acceptable. Five of the six were from autumn, whereas the overwhelming majority of records the committee continued to accept are from the spring/summer period. All 24 spring records of <b>Siberian</b> <b>stonechat</b> were reconsidered in 2002–04, in the light of new information on the variability in appearance of European stonechats in spring; the committee decided that all but five should remain accepted. In 2003, the committee revised its assessment criteria for male pine buntings, redefining some birds previously considered hybrids [...] as acceptable, but requiring an overall greater level of precision in descriptions, and reviewed past records in the light of these changes.|$|E
50|$|Very rarely, {{hybridisation}} occurs {{between the}} whinchat and the <b>Siberian</b> <b>stonechat</b> (Saxicola maurus), {{with a case}} being reported in Finland in 1997. It has also been reported to hybridise with the European stonechat in western and southern Europe.|$|E
50|$|Though fairly {{similar to}} females and immatures of the European {{stonechat}} (S. rubicola), the whinchat can readily be distinguished by its conspicuous supercilium and whiter belly, {{and also in}} western Europe, by being paler overall than the western European stonechat subspecies S. rubicola hibernans. It also differs structurally in being slightly slimmer and less 'dumpy', and having longer wingtips (an adaptation to its long-distance migration). It is more easily confused with female or immature <b>Siberian</b> <b>stonechat</b> (S. maura), which (also being a long-distance migrant) shares the longer wingtips; however, <b>Siberian</b> <b>stonechat</b> can be distinguished by its conspicuous unmarked pale orange-buff rump (in whinchat, the rump is the same mottled brown colour as the back).|$|E
40|$|To {{anticipate}} seasonal change, organisms schedule {{their annual}} activities by using calendrical cues like photoperiod. The use of cues must be fitted to local conditions because schedules differ between species and habitats. In {{complete absence of}} temporal information, many species show persistent circannual cycles that are synchronised, but not driven, by photoperiod. The contribution of circannual rhythms to timing under natural photoperiodic conditions is still unclear. In a suite of experiments, we examined timing in two closely related songbirds (<b>Siberian</b> and European <b>stonechats)</b> that inhabit similar latitudes but differ in seasonal behaviour. Under a more continental climate, <b>Siberian</b> <b>stonechats</b> breed later, moult faster and migrate further than European stonechats. We tested hypotheses for seasonal timing mechanisms by comparing the birds under constant and naturally changing daylengths. The taxa retained characteristic reproductive and moult schedules and hybrids behaved roughly intermediately. Based on their distinct circannual cycles, we expected European and <b>Siberian</b> <b>stonechats</b> to differ in photoperiodic responses {{at a given time}} of year. We found that the taxa responded, as predicted, in opposite ways to photoperiodic simulations as experienced on different migration routes. The findings indicate that circannual rhythms reflect geographically distinct periodic changes in seasonal disposition and cue-response mechanisms. Under natural daylengths, the phase relationship of the underlying circannual rhythm to the external year determines the action of photoperiod. Circannual rhythms are widespread among long-lived species. Accordingly, responses to environmental change, range expansion and novel migration patterns may depend on the particulars of a species' underlying circannual programming...|$|R
40|$|Rigid {{schedules}} of long-distance migrants {{could be}} among candidate traits for adaptive migratory syndromes. This prediction was tested on stonechats, passerines that differ widely in migratory behavior and seasonal schedules. Stonechats in Europe are short-distance migrants and multiclutched, whereas African residents and Siberian long-distance migrants usually raise single broods. In captivity, all subspecies displayed endogenous cycles of reproductive development and molt. The subspecies differed in time afforded to life cycle stages. Under conducive aviary conditions, African stonechats were multibrooded, whereas <b>Siberian</b> <b>stonechats</b> did not add clutches. This difference in flexibility was exclusively {{related to the}} length of breeding windows. Stonechats also differed in premigratory preparations. Postjuvenile molt started early in <b>Siberian</b> <b>stonechats,</b> but in European and African stonechats, depended strongly on hatching date. In contrast, all subspecies shortened molt duration at the same rate when hatched from late broods. Plasticity of Zugunruhe timing was identical in Siberian and European subspecies and nearly compensated for hatching late. The stonechat data suggest a refined understanding of temporal plasticity in long-distance migrants. Overall, plasticity was not reduced, but was differently organized. Apparently rigid migrant schedules were related to short breeding cycles and inflexible molt onset. Short windows for breeding and juvenile development could provide safety measures for timely departure. Once molt was initiated, temporal plasticity of long-distance migrants matched that of less migratory conspecifics. In addition to adjusting endogenous programs, stonechats differed in implementing them in the field. Modifying the conditions under which programs are expressed may be an efficient way to enhance seasonal plasticity...|$|R

They intergrade broadly where their ranges meet, from southeastern England south through France and Spain, and many individuals are not identifiable to subspecies. Extreme examples of S. r. rubicola from the driest southern areas of its range such as the Algarve and Sicily are particularly pale and with a large white rump, and can be very similar to <b>Siberian</b> <b>stonechats</b> in appearance. nDNA microsatellite fingerprinting reveals a very small degree of separation between the two subspecies.|$|R

40|$|Studies of Zugunruhe – the ‘migratory restlessness’ {{behaviour}} of captive birds – {{have been}} integral {{to our understanding}} of animal migration, revealing an inherited propensity to migrate and an endogenous timing and navigation system. However, differences between Zugunruhe in captivity and migration in the wild call for more data, in particular on variation within and among taxa with diverse migration strategies. Here, we characterise Zugunruhe in a long-term dataset of activity profiles from stonechats (genus Saxicola) with diverse migratory phenotypes (976 migration periods from 414 birds), using a flexible and consistent quantitative approach based on changepoint analysis. For east African, Austrian, Irish, and <b>Siberian</b> <b>stonechats</b> and hybrids, we report key inter-population differences in the occurrence, timing, and intensity of Zugunruhe. In line with expectations, we found the highest Zugunruhe intensity in the longest-distance migrants, more variable patterns in short-distance migrants, and intermediate characteristics of hybrids relative to their parental groups. Inter-population differences imply high evolutionary lability of Zugunruhe timing within a robustly structured annual cycle. However, counter to theory, Irish partial migrants showed no segregation between migrant and resident individuals, and previously reported nocturnal restlessness was confirmed for resident African stonechats. Further features of nocturnal restlessness that did not align with migratory behaviour of stonechats were juvenile nocturnal restlessness even prior to postjuvenile moult, and protandry in spring, although stonechats winter in heterosexual pairs. Importantly, Zugunruhe of all populations declined with age, and the intensity of an individual bird's Zugunruhe was correlated with activity levels during other parts of the annual cycle. Our results confirm endogenous, population-specific migration programmes but also reveal apparent discrepancies between Zugunruhe and migration in the wild. We thus highlight both the continued potential of Zugunruhe study and the need for circumspect interpretation when using migratory restlessness to make inferences about migration in the wild. © 2017 The Author...|$|R
40|$|With {{progressively}} faster global change, {{shifts in}} phenology, and distributional ranges are reported for {{an increasing number}} of species. The success of organisms at coping with novel seasonal conditions depends on the mechanisms that determine their schedules. Species that rely on fixed schedules and those that time their activities by predictive cues may be particularly constrained in their ability to accommodate changes. The present study examines rigid scheduling and its implications for breeding in captivity in an avian model taxon, the Stonechat (Saxicola torquata). Within their extensive breeding range, Stonechats differ geographically in migratory behavior and reproduce and molt under a wide range of daylengths (10 – 17 h). Stonechats time their activities by programs that involve circannual rhythms and photoperiodism. The study reports reproductive timing of four taxa (central European, Irish, Siberian, and Kenyan), relates it to laydates in the field, and investigates modifying influences of housing conditions and of social context. Reproductive consequences of timing programs were then tested by crossbreeding of taxa with different schedules. The study revealed persistent, population-specific breeding windows in captivity. Resident Stonechats from equatorial Kenya synchronized their reproductive cycles with the European summer, presumably in response to local photoperiod, and bred at similar times as northern migrants. In all other taxa schedules matched those in the field, but were timed slightly earlier in captivity and advanced by indoor keeping conditions. Influences of social context were negligible. In pairs with clutches, testes regressed slightly later than in pairs without clutches, but presence of a mate per se had no influence on breeding cycles. Accordingly, crossbreeding Stonechats were predicted to have limited capacity to adjust schedules to those of their mates. This prediction was tested by crossbreeding of single-clutched Siberian long-distance migrants with multiple-clutched European short-distance migrants. Males and females of both taxa retained their characteristic breeding schedules, regardless of their mate's activities. This led to dramatic loss of reproductive success in the population with the longer breeding season, European <b>Stonechats.</b> <b>Siberian</b> <b>Stonechats</b> were unable to profit from the presence of a sexually active mate, but they suffered no disadvantage from crossbreeding. In a changing world, inherited timing programs may severely constrain responses to novel conditions, impose schedule-dependent, asymmetric costs of hybridization, and contribute to directional gene flow or to reproductive isolation...|$|R
5000|$|Genetic and {{behavioural}} {{evidence has}} {{also resulted in}} several new species being accepted in the genus in recent years, most notably the splitting of the former broad [...] "species" [...] common stonechat Saxicola torquatus into five species, a change now widely though not yet universally accepted.

Due to confusion of subspecies allocation, the name S. torquatus was briefly used for the European species, with the African stonechat being incorrectly listed as S. axillaris.|$|R
50|$|In the past, the European {{stonechat}} {{was generally}} considered conspecific with the <b>Siberian</b> <b>stonechat</b> and African stonechat, lumped together as common stonechat S. torquatus.

50|$|The <b>Siberian</b> <b>stonechat</b> is insectivorous. It breeds in open rough {{scrubland}} or rough grassland with scattered shrubs, {{from sea}} level to about 4,000 m ASL or more.

40|$|Stonechats (genus Saxicola) are {{passerine}} {{birds with}} an extraordinarily large breeding distribution.

Here, we present additional data on the geographic differentiation among African stonechats, Saxicola torquatus. Nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 and cytochrome b genes indicate that the stonechats from Eastern Madagascar (Saxicola t. sibilla) form a distinct clade and that they constitute a monophyletic group with stonechats from mainland eastern Africa (Saxicola t. axillaris) and La Réunion (Saxicola tectes).

40|$|The {{stonechat}} {{has one of}} {{the widest}} breeding distributions among the Old World passerines. It breeds under tropical, subtropical, north- and south-temperate, and sub-arctic conditions. Also its migratory strategies vary, ranging from year-round residency in areas such different as the British Isles and equatorial Africa, to long-distance migration in northern Asia. These characteristics {{and the fact that it}} can be successfully bred in captivity make the stonechat an ideal model species for studying life-history variation under varying seasonal regimes, both in the field and in the lab. In Chapter 1 I develop the conceptual framework for the study of annual timing and life-history variation in stonechats. My studies focus on free-living stonechats from two different populations, Siberian stonechats breeding in northern Kazakhstan and European stonechats breeding in central Slovakia. The taxonomic status and the basic biology of the stonechat and the characteristics of the two study sites are outlined in Chapter 2. Both sites are situated in the temperate zones and hence the local photoperiodic conditions are similar. However, due to the continental climate in Kazakhstan the summer is shorter and hotter and the precipitation lower than in Slovakia, and as a result the breeding season is about two months longer at the European site. The two populations differ in their migratory strategies (Chapter 3). The Siberian stonechats are long-distance migrants that travel up to 6500 km from their breeding to their wintering grounds and pass major ecological barriers like deserts and high mountain ranges on their way. The stonechats from eastern Europe are short-distance migrants that travel about 1500 km. Ringing recovery data suggest that a large proportion of them pass the Mediterranean Sea on their way. There are no ringing recoveries for Siberian stonechats, and information on their migratory routes is sparse and dispersed in different sources. I tried to fill this gap by reconstructing the spatio-temporal pattern of the stonechat migrations within Central Asia and southern Siberia from published passage data. Stonechats enter Central Asia in spring from the south-west, which suggests that they largely avoid the high inner-Asian mountain ranges. From there they spread northwards into their Central Asian and Siberian breeding areas. In autumn they retrace this pattern backwards, however the movement is less concerted than in spring. The passage data can be used to calculate the average speed of migration within the area and compare it to migration speed in the European stonechats. The European stonechats move at higher speeds during spring than during autumn. This is consistent with data on other European passerines. Within Central Asia, however, the stonechats seem to be constrained in their spring movements because they have to stop and wait for ameliorating local conditions. Increasing spring temperatures due to global warming may therefore have a high potential to change migratory phenology in the Siberian stonechats. Birds shut down their reproductive system during the nonbreeding seasons. Migratory birds face a potential conflict between the preparation for breeding and migration, because gonadal maturation takes several weeks. I investigated whether the migratory strategy affects the gonadal state at the time of arrival in the breeding areas (Chapter 4). Males of both populations arrive at the breeding sites with gonads that are not fully developed. Neither the gonadal state in relation to the onset of reproduction, nor the rate of development to the mature state differ in the two populations. This could indicate that the late stages of reproductive development are mainly affected by the targeted date of reproduction and/or by physiological determinants of gonadal maturation rates, whereas the migratory period has less effect. More knowledge about reproductive development along the migratory route, particularly in long-distance migrants, is required. In my study populations local breeders and passage migrants are not distinguishable on the basis of their gonadal development. However, the data in the passage migrants is more variable, which could reflect differences in reproductive timing due to different migratory destinations. Due to the local conditions at the breeding site and the temporal requirements of migration the stonechats in Kazakhstan have a shorter breeding season than their conspecifics in Slovakia (Chapter 5). The Siberian stonechats produce generally one clutch per season, but lost clutches are often replaced. European stonechats lay up to three clutches per season. The interval between clutch loss and relaying does not differ between the two populations. Breeding synchrony is significantly higher in Kazakhstan, both over the whole breeding period and when only the first clutches are considered. Overall clutch size is higher in the Siberian stonechats. Clutch size decreases from first to replacement clutches in Kazakhstan, and from first to second clutches in Slovakia. The clutch size of the third clutches in the European stonechats increases again, which may indicate that only high-quality parents initiate a third seasonal breeding attempt, or that a strategy of terminal investment is involved. Fledging success per egg is higher in Kazakhstan and does not differ between breeding attempts. In Slovakia fledging success drops markedly from the first to the later breeding attempts. Predation during the egg stage plays a greater role in the European stonechats, whereas in the Siberian stonechats predation on nestlings is more important. As a result of smaller clutch sizes later in the season, and of higher failure rates in later clutches, particularly in Slovakia, fledgling output per clutch decreases in both populations. A Kazakh breeding pair produces on average about five fledglings per season, a Slovak breeding pair about seven fledglings per season. In one study season 9 % of the Kazakh males mated simultaneously with two females. Facultative polygyny has previously been reported in European, but not in Siberian stonechats. The primary clutches of polygynous males were initiated earlier, contained more eggs and produced more fledglings than the comparable first clutches of monogamous males. This may indicate that polygynous males were of superior parental quality. The secondary polygynous clutches were initiated later, contained less eggs and produced less fledglings, indicating costs in terms of reproductive success for secondary females. According to the challenge hypothesis the length of the breeding period, the degree of inter-male competition, and the degree of parental care affect the seasonal profiles of circulating androgens (Chapter 6). Male Siberian stonechats have elevated circulating androgen levels during May and June with a peak in mid-May. In the European stonechats androgens are elevated from March until the end of May, they peak in mid-April and mid-May. In both populations androgen levels are highest in males during the territorial stages and when the females are fertile, and decrease during the parenting stages. Overall androgen levels are higher in the European stonechat males, which could be explained by higher male-male competition and/or a lower degree of paternal care in this population. Male aggression during simulated territorial intrusions is high throughout the season in both populations and therefore apparently unrelated to the circulating androgen levels. In the <b>Siberian</b> <b>stonechat</b> males dihydrotestosterone (DHT) contributes relatively more to the total circulating androgens. This could be related to different roles of DHT and testosterone (T) in regulating male reproductive behaviours, or to different costs associated with high circulating levels of these androgens. Estradiol (E 2) is basal throughout the season in Siberian and European stonechat males. In female stonechats the levels of circulating gonadal steroids (E 2, T, DHT) are basal throughout the season. T is higher in the European stonechat females than in the Kazakh females, however there is no apparent seasonal pattern. The adrenal glucocorticoids (GCs) are steroid hormones that act in general energy metabolism and as part of the response of an organism to unpredictable threats to its physiological homeostasis (Chapter 7). Two hypotheses try to explain seasonal and individual variation in circulating GCs. The reproductive limitation hypothesis predicts that, because high GCs may cause nest desertion, GC response to stress is reduced when breeding opportunities are limited, as in the Siberian stonechats. Contrary to this predictions, overall GC levels are higher in the Siberian than in the European stonechats. Hence there seems to be no simple relationship between the potential number of breeding attempts and GC levels in stonechats. The energy mobilisation hypothesis predicts higher GC levels during periods of increased energy demand, such as breeding. The energetic costs may differ between breeding stages, at least in males. However, GC levels do not vary with breeding stage in the stonechats. GC levels decrease in Kazakhstan when the birds start to moult. Feather replacement is an energetically costly task; therefore a simple relationship between energy demand and circulating GCs is not supported. It is possible that GCs interfere with the physiology of feather replacement and are therefore reduced during this period. Time-dependent mortality, the degree of sibling competition, and internal constraints on growth have been discussed as the major factors affecting the evolution of developmental rates (Chapter 8). The length of the breeding season may also affect juvenile development, particularly in migrants, where the juveniles have to gain a certain level of maturity to meet the demands of the autumn movements. Incubation periods are slightly shorter in Kazakhstan than in Slovakia, indicating that embryonic development may proceed at a higher rate in the Siberian stonechats. Postnatal increase rate in body size, but not in wing length, is also higher in the Siberian stonechats. These measures of postnatal growth are not affected by the hatching date. Runt nestlings, which are at a competitive disadvantage because they have hatched later than their nestmates, are initially heavier and bigger but loose this head start during the growth period due to lower growth rates. Postjuvenile moult is initiated very early in the life of Siberian stonechats. as in their captive conspecifics. It is shifted forward by a few days in the late-hatched chicks of replacement clutches, however the effect of hatch date on the onset of moult is much lower than in captive European stonechats. The period from the start of incubation until the end of postjuvenile moult lasts about half as long in the Siberian stonechats than in the European stonechats, mainly due to differences in the onset and duration of moult between the populations. Siberian stonechats lay only one clutch per season, but lost clutches are often replaced (Chapter 9). Normal breeders (those birds that raised their first clutch successfully) initiate postnuptial moult shortly after their young have left the nest. Late breeders (birds with replacement clutches) moult later than normal breeders. However, they initiate moult earlier in relation to the age of their offspring than normal breeders. As a result, they overlap breeding and moult more than normal breeders. Simultaneous reproduction and feather replacement is thought to be costly and therefore generally avoided. This is not always possible in time-constrained breeders. In the Siberian stonechats the degree of moult-breeding overlap increases the later the offspring hatches in the season. Scarce data suggests that late breeding males initiate moult earlier than their female partners. This may imply that they reduce their share in parental care, as has been found in other species. Postponing moult of body feathers, which serves mainly in insulation, may have less severe consequences in a migratory species, than postponing wing moult. Late breeders postpone body moult more than wing moult. Siberian stonechats in Kazakhstan and European stonechats in Slowakia are closely related and breed both in the north-temperate zones in the same latitude and under similar photoperiodic conditions. However, due to the different local climatic conditions, the migratory distance and the length of the breeding season differ. This brings about consistent differences between the two populations in the migratory behaviour, the breeding performance, the hormonal regulation of reproduction, the hormonal response to environmental challenges, and the juvenile development. Because the Siberian and Slovak stonechat populations are closely related, a divergent genetic background and/or species-specific physiological constraints probably play a minor role in creating these differences. They rather reflect differences in annual timing, which affect the trade-off between current and future reproductive success in different life-history stages. The climatic changes that are observed in recent years have been associated with changing migratory and reproductive schedules and shifts in species’ distribution ranges. The example of the stonechats shows that a multitude of systemic changes is required to change the annual cycle. The success of an organism in a changing environment will depend on its ability to successfully integrate all these physiological and behavioural alterations...|$|E
