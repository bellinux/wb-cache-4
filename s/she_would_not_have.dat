5|$|Chapter 5 relates that Odin {{gave all}} of his temple priests {{dwelling}} places and good estates, in Njörðr's case being Nóatún. Chapter 8 states that Njörðr married a woman named Skaði, though <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> intercourse with him. Skaði then marries Odin, and the two had numerous sons.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in the Dunphy family, Dylan (Reid Ewing), Haley's boyfriend, tags {{along on}} the trip, much to Claire's chagrin. However, Phil (Ty Burrell) {{eventually}} convinces her that she should {{try to get to}} know Dylan. She attempts to, but suddenly Dylan proposes to Haley (Sarah Hyland) around the campfire one night. This causes Claire (Julie Bowen) to instantly say no for Haley, leading to Dylan running away. The families go off and look for him, during which Haley criticizes Claire for interfering and reveals <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> accepted Dylan's proposal. It is also revealed that Dylan gets a job at the ranch and decides to permanently stay in Wyoming, breaking up with Haley.|$|E
5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{interviews}} {{for a job}} in Philadelphia, where she finds her potential manager, Mark (Bob Odenkirk), is remarkably like her former Dunder Mifflin regional manager Michael Scott. While this initially amuses her, Pam gradually realizes that the prospect of working under another Michael Scott is abhorrent, and her horror increases when Mark reveals that she is interviewing for a glorified receptionist's job. During a romantic dinner, Pam finally admits to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that even had the prospective job and boss been perfect <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> wanted to take it, since she does not really want to move to Philadelphia, despite Jim having started his own business there.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we re-examine the German {{dominance}} hypothesis, {{as a way}} to assess whether the loss of monetary autonomy in Europe associated with EMU had been significant. We use Granger-causality tests between the interest rates of Germany and all the countries participating {{at any time in the}} European Monetary System, with the sample period running until December 1998. Our results would support a weak version of the hypothesis, with Germany playing a certain “leadership” or special role in the EMS, although <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> been strictly the “dominant” player...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] assented Sylvia in an {{indifferent}} tone, {{though she}} was slightly disturbed. Herbert was keen-witted, and <b>she</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>not</b> <b>have</b> had him {{take an interest in}} her affairs.|$|R
5|$|To {{satisfy the}} {{prejudice}} prong of Strickland, a defendant who pleads guilty must {{show that there}} is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's deficient performance, he or <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> plead guilty. In Padilla v. Kentucky (2010), the Court held that counsel's failure to inform an alien pleading guilty of the risk of deportation fell below the objective standard of the performance prong of Strickland and permitted an alien who would not have plead guilty but for such failure to withdraw his guilty plea.|$|E
5|$|Hepburn {{was known}} for being {{fiercely}} private, and would not give interviews or talk to fans for much of her career. She distanced herself from the celebrity lifestyle, uninterested in a social scene she saw as tedious and superficial, and she wore casual clothes that went strongly against convention {{in an era of}} glamour. She rarely appeared in public, even avoiding restaurants, and once wrestled a camera out of a photographer's hand when he took a picture without asking. Despite her zeal for privacy, she enjoyed her fame, and later confessed that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> liked the press to ignore her completely. The protective attitude thawed as she aged; beginning with a two-hour-long interview on The Dick Cavett Show in 1973, Hepburn became increasingly open with the public.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Raimi {{expressed}} interest in portraying the transformation of Dr. Curt Connors into his villainous alter-ego, the Lizard, a villain which had been teased since Spider-Man 2; the character's actor Dylan Baker and producer Grant Curtis were also enthusiastic about the idea. By December 2009, John Malkovich was in negotiations to play Vulture and Anne Hathaway would play Felicia Hardy, though <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> transformed into the Black Cat as in the comics but a new superpowered figure, the Vulturess. According to sources online, an early draft of the film {{would have had the}} Vulture buying out the Daily Bugle, forcing Spider-Man to kill him. Felicia Hardy, Vulture's daughter in this version of the script, would have had an affair with Peter Parker in order to shatter his engagement with Mary Jane. These rumors were never confirmed. Raimi stated years later during an interview in 2013, however, that Hathaway was going to be Black Cat if Spider-Man 4 had been made.|$|E

5|$|The {{silencer}} {{played a}} central role. It was deemed to {{have been on the}} rifle when it was fired, because of the blood found inside it. The prosecution said the blood had come from Sheila's head when the silencer was pointed at her. Had she discovered that she could not shoot herself with the silencer attached, the court heard, it would have been found next to her body; she had no reason to return it to the gun cupboard. That she had carried out the killings was further discounted because, it was argued, she had not recently expressed suicidal thoughts; the expert evidence was that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> harmed her children or father; she had no interest in or knowledge of guns; she lacked the strength to overcome her father; and there was no evidence on her clothes or body that she had moved around the crime scene or been involved in a struggle. In particular, her long fingernails had remained intact.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Raimi {{expressed}} interest in portraying the transformation of Dr. Curt Connors into his villainous alter-ego, the Lizard; the character's actor Dylan Baker and producer Grant Curtis were also enthusiastic about the idea. Raimi also discussed his desire to upgrade Bruce Campbell from a cameo appearance to a significant role, later revealed to be Quentin Beck / Mysterio. It was reported in December 2009 that John Malkovich was in negotiations to play Vulture and that Anne Hathaway would play Felicia Hardy, though <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> transformed into the Black Cat as in the comics. Instead, Raimi's Felicia was expected to become a new superpowered figure called the Vulturess. However, several years later, in 2013, Raimi stated that Hathaway {{was going to be}} Black Cat if Spider-Man 4 had been made. Concept art revealed in June 2016 showed the inclusion of an opening montage of Spider-Man going up against C and D-list villains, such as Mysterio, the Shocker, the Prowler, and the Rhino, with the Vulture serving as the main antagonist.|$|E
25|$|While she {{supported}} the Iraq War, during the Deputy Leadership campaign, {{she said that}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> voted for it had she been in full possession of the facts, specifically {{about the lack of}} concrete evidence of weapons of mass destruction.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no," [...] {{said his}} lordship, {{after looking at}} his daughter, whose colour fled {{at the idea of}} seeing the deer shot, although, had her father {{expressed}} his wish that they should accompany Norman, it was probable <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> even <b>have</b> hinted her reluctance.|$|R
60|$|He {{remained}} in and about Marygreen through the intervening days, {{went out on}} Friday morning {{to see that the}} grave was finished, and wondered if Sue <b>would</b> come. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> written, and that seemed to signify rather that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> come than that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not.</b> <b>Having</b> timed her by her only possible train, he locked the door about mid-day, and crossed the hollow field to the verge of the upland by the Brown House, where he stood and looked over the vast prospect northwards, and over the nearer landscape in which Alfredston stood. Two miles behind it a jet of white steam was travelling from the left {{to the right of the}} picture.|$|R

25|$|Stoltenberg refuted {{the notion}} that she started using drugs because she couldn't deal with the {{pressure}} of having such successful siblings. Had {{it not been for}} the many problems of her relationship at the time, she said, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> turned to drugs for an escape.|$|E
25|$|Duffy {{was almost}} {{appointed}} Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom in 1999 {{after the death}} of Ted Hughes, but lost out on the position to Andrew Motion. Duffy said <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> accepted the position at that time anyway, because she was in a relationship with Scottish poet Jackie Kay, had a young daughter, and would not have welcomed the public attention. In the same year, she was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.|$|E
25|$|Cowdrey met {{his second}} wife, Lady Anne Fitzalan-Howard, the eldest {{daughter}} of Bernard Fitzalan-Howard, 16th Duke of Norfolk, {{when her father}} managed the MCC tour of Australia in 1962-63. Cowdrey divorced Penny in 1985 and married Anne the same year. Anne had succeeded to the title of Lady Herries of Terregles in 1975 {{and when he was}} ennobled in 1997 she became also Baroness Cowdrey of Tonbridge (although as a peer in her own right <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> used a courtesy title).|$|E
50|$|Roxy spoke {{too quickly}} during their presentation, cutting off Stephanie's line completely. She defended {{herself in the}} boardroom, blaming this on the project manager and saying that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{be the one who}} should have fixed things up, and also saying that what <b>she</b> did <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> {{affected}} anything.|$|R

25|$|Osbourne has freely {{admitted}} to having extensive cosmetic surgery. As well as documenting this in her autobiography, she appeared on Dr. Phil on 14 December 2006, and commented on everything that had been surgically changed on her body to improve her appearance. She stated {{that she had had}} a full rhytidectomy, abdominoplasty, mastopexy, as well as many other procedures, but commented that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> any surgery performed on her eyes or lips. She has {{admitted to}} spending £300,000 on plastic surgery.|$|E
25|$|King Karl and Queen Olga legally adopted Grand Duchess Vera in 1871. They {{arranged}} {{her marriage}} {{to a member of}} the Silesian branch of their family, Duke Eugen of Württemberg (b. 20 August 1846 – 27 January 1877), as in this way <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to leave the country after her marriage. The couple were distant cousin as Vera was a great-great granddaughter of Friedrich II Eugen, Duke of Württemberg twice over; on her father's side and on her mother's.|$|E
25|$|According to Paul Churchland, Mary {{might be}} {{considered}} to be like a feral child. Feral children have suffered extreme isolation during childhood. Technically when Mary leaves the room, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> the ability to see or know what the color red is. A brain has to learn and develop how to see colors. Patterns need to form in the V4 section of the visual cortex. These patterns are formed from exposure to wavelengths of light. This exposure is needed during the early stages of brain development. In Mary's case, the identifications and categorizations of color will only be in respect to representations of black and white.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1962 {{film version}} of Meredith Willson's musical The Music Man, Marian Paroo the {{librarian}} asks the prudish Mrs. Shinn, the mayor's wife, if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> rather <b>have</b> her daughter reading the classic Persian poetry of Omar Khayyam than Elinor Glyn, to which Mrs. Shinn replies: [...] "What Elinor Glyn reads is her mother's problem!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Logan {{made use}} of a Kickstarter {{campaign}} and two Indiegogo campaigns to raise funds. [...] The Kickstarter campaign, which was to raise funding to complete editing, exceeded its $25,000 goal and raised $34,075 by January 1, 2014. [...] Logan said that the campaigns were a full-time job, but they gave her a built-in audience that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> otherwise <b>have</b> had.|$|R
60|$|Feemy {{still had}} on the new collar, and she pulled it off and threw it on the table; she evidently {{imagined}} that {{it had something to}} do with her brother's unusual request. <b>She</b> certainly <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> put it on in that loose way, had <b>she</b> thought he <b>would</b> have seen it; but then he so seldom came in there.|$|R
25|$|Inspector Kelsey {{interviews}} {{everyone and}} Adam Goodman reveals his true identity (undercover British agent {{posing as a}} gardener) to Miss Bulstrode. Jennifer Sutcliffe, an expert tennis player, complains that her racquet feels unbalanced and writes to her mother asking for a new one. Meanwhile, she swaps racquets with Julia Upjohn, who prefers Jennifer's as it was refurbished recently. Later a strange woman arrives and gives Jennifer a new racquet, saying it is a gift from her Aunt Gina. The woman takes the old racquet (actually Julia's racquet). Julia later realises that Aunt Gina {{would have known that}} Jennifer's racquet had been refurbished and restrung recently, so <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> assumed the problem is in the strings. Soon enough, Jennifer's aunt writes that she did not send the new racquet.|$|E
25|$|The police {{eventually}} {{identify the}} victim's clothing as being of French manufacture. Emma tells {{the police that}} she had received a letter claiming to be from Martine, a French girl whom her brother Edmund had wanted to marry. He had written about Martine and their impending marriage days {{before his death in}} the retreat to Dunkirk in 1940. The letter purporting to be from Martine claims that she was pregnant when Edmund died and that she now wishes their son to have all of the advantages to which his parentage should entitle him. The police conclude that the body in the sarcophagus is that of Martine but this proves not to be the case when Lady Stoddart-West, mother of James Stoddart-West, reveals that she is Martine. Although she and Edmund had intended to marry, Edmund died before they could do so and she later married an SOE officer and settled in England. She adds that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> come forward until learning from her son of the forged letter to Emma.|$|E

She tells Zach and Reese {{that she will be}} leaving town, but she secretly stays to spy on them. When Bianca witnesses Zach and Reese in an embrace as Zach gives Reese a kiss to the forehead, she believes Reese is cheating on her and flees. She ends up in a car accident soon afterward, but suffers no serious injuries. Zach and Reese rush to the hospital to see Bianca, and Bianca explains that she saw them embracing. She asks if they are in love. Zach and Reese say no. Despite this, Bianca is furious with Reese and does not want to talk with her. Reese frustratedly leaves the hospital and sends Bianca a note saying she plans to leave. After reading the note, Bianca hurries home to convince Reese to stay; she says that she loves her and knows that she is not romantically interested in Zach. Reese says that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> left, regardless.|$|E
50|$|She {{has written}} two {{noteworthy}} books: Mama Dip’s Kitchen and Mama Dip’s Family Cookbook. Her books share not only recipes, but also great stories {{about her life}} in food. Mama Dip celebrates {{the importance of family}} and community based around cuisine, Southern cooking in particular. She has been featured on Good Morning America and on the Food Network’s Cooking Live. It also appeared on an episode of Rachael Ray's $40 a Day. She said, referring to Mama Dip’s Kitchen, that {{if it were not for}} the restaurant, then <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> put her books together.

Had Walter left her a hundred a year, <b>she</b> <b>would,</b> <b>not</b> <b>having</b> then dreamed of higher things, have been amply content. <b>Would</b> it <b>not</b> be better that she should take for herself some modest competence, something on which she might live without trouble to her relatives, without trouble to her friends she had first said,--but as she did so she told herself with scorn that friends she had none,--and then let the Balls have what was left her after she had kept her promise to her brother? Anything would be better than such persecution as that to which her aunt had subjected her.|$|R
