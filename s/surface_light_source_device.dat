The optical TRx module {{consisted of a}} metal optical bench, a module printed circuit board (PCB), a driver/receiver IC, a VCSEL/PD array, and an optical link block composed of plastic optical fiber (POF). For the optical interconnection between the light-sources and detectors, an optical wiring method has been proposed to enable easy assembly. The key benefit of fiber optic link {{is the absence of}} electromagnetic interference (EMI) noise creation and susceptibility. This paper provides a method for optical interconnection between an optical Tx and an optical Rx, comprising the following steps: () forming a <b>light</b> <b>source</b> <b>device,</b> an optical detection device, and an optical transmission unit on a substrate (metal optical bench (MOB)); () preparing a flexible optical transmission-connection medium (optical wiring link) to optically connect the <b>light</b> <b>source</b> <b>device</b> formed on the substrate with the optical detection device; and () directly connecting one end of the surface-finished optical transmission connection medium with the <b>light</b> <b>source</b> <b>device</b> and the other end with the optical detection device.

40|$|During {{the complex}} path {{workpiece}} welding, {{it is important}} to keep the welding torch aligned with the groove center using a visual seam detection method, so that the deviation between the torch and the groove can be corrected automatically. However, when detecting the narrow butt of a specular reflection workpiece, the existing methods may fail because of the extremely small groove width and the poor imaging quality. This paper proposes a novel detection method to solve these issues. We design a uniform <b>surface</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> to get high signal-to-noise ratio images against the specular reflection effect, and a double-line laser <b>light</b> <b>source</b> is used to obtain the workpiece surface equation relative to the torch. Two <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> are switched on alternately and the camera is synchronized to capture images when each light is on; then the position and pose between the torch and the groove can be obtained nearly at the same time. Experimental results show that our method can detect the groove effectively and efficiently during the welding process. The image resolution is 12. 5 μm and the processing time is less than 10 ms per frame. This indicates our method can be applied to real-time narrow butt detection during high-speed welding process...|$|R

Specimens were placed in a 37 ± 1 °C water bath to standardize the temperature. The temperature in the pulp chamber was measured every 10 s during 40 s of light activation of the adhesive system (SBMP- 3 M/ESPE) and in the three consecutive 1 -mm-thick layers of resin composite (Z 250 - 3 M/ESPE). Three <b>light</b> <b>source</b> <b>devices</b> were evaluated: Elipar 2500 (QTH), LD Max (LED low irradiance) and VALO (LED high irradiance). The results were submitted to one-way ANOVA with repeated measures and Tukey's test, both with p< 0. 001. The exothermic reaction warming was observed in the Z 250 increments, {{but not in the}} SBMP. The high irradiance LED showed a higher temperature average (42. 7 ± 1. 56 °C), followed by the quartz-tungsten-halogen light (40. 6 ± 0. 67 °C) and the lower irradiance LED (37. 8 ± 0. 12 °C). Higher temperature increases were observed with the adhesive and the first resin composite increment light-activation, regardless of the employed <b>light</b> <b>source.</b> From the second increment of Z 250, the restorative material acted as a dispersive structure of heat, reducing temperature increases. Regardless the <b>light</b> <b>source</b> and restorative step, the temperature increased with the irradiation time.

40|$|Only about 5 % of the {{invested}} {{electrical power}} is radiated as visible light from incandescent light bulbs, {{the other part}} of the power is lost, as it is emitted as heat. Therefore, using more efficient <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> appears to be a reasonable goal. Besides the common light bulb, there are several other types of illumination sources which are more efficient and therefore used in lighting applications, e. g., fluorescent tubes, compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), and halogen incandescent lamps. Promising candidates for even more efficient, longer-lasting <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> derive from the area of 'solid-state lighting' (SSL), where light is generated by solid-state electroluminescence, i. e., radiative recombination of holes and electrons; in contrast to light generation by heat, as in incandescent <b>light</b> <b>sources.</b> SSL <b>devices</b> are 'light-emitting diodes' (LEDs, using inorganic semiconductors), or 'organic light-emitting diodes' (OLEDs, using organic materials). LEDs already have a vast distribution being used as indicators in everyday objects, e. g., in consumer electronics, traffic lights, cars, and others. They are also used as backlight in computer displays and flat-panel TVs, saving energy and providing almost constant luminance for very long times (half-luminance lifetimes of several 10, 000 to 100, 000 hours). For the same reasons, saving energy and extremely long-lasting, LEDs are more and more considered for lighting applications. There is another class of solid-state <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> besides inorganic LEDs: their organic counterparts using thin films of organic compounds [...] the organic light-emitting diodes. One of their main advantages is that OLEDs are uniform <b>surface</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> (and not point sources as LEDs, or, to some extent, incandescent lamps). This allows entirely new, fascinating lighting possibilities, such as luminescent ceilings or windows which are transparent at daytime and the source of room illumination at night. OLEDs can be fabricated on different substrates, usually on glass, but also on, e. g., thin metal or plastic foils. As a consequence, OLEDs can be flexible and can be adjusted to different surface forms. Also, cheap processing can be achieved using high-volume printing techniques, like roll-to-roll or inkjet-printing. To fully tap the potential of organic light-emitting diodes for lighting applications, they need further improvement concerning light-outcoupling, efficiency, and device lifetime. To achieve a fundamental understanding of the involved processes, these topics are addressed in this thesis: simulation based optical optimization, and electrical characterization and device degradation studies using impedance spectroscopy. Organische Leuchtdioden (organic light-emitting diodes, OLEDs) sind Flächenlichtquellen bestehend aus dünnen Schichten organischer Materialien.
