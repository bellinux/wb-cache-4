5|$|Experimental {{breeding}} {{programs in}} the early 20th century succeeded in re-establishing the breed to some extent, but mechanization, combined with two world wars, again resulted in the breed almost becoming extinct. In the 1980s, concerned with the declining population numbers, interested breeders undertook a promotional program, which resulted in renewed interest in the breed. By the 1990s, population numbers were higher, and genetic studies in 1998 and 2012 found relatively high levels of genetic diversity for a small breed. However, livestock conservation organizations <b>still</b> <b>consider</b> the breed to be at risk, due to low population numbers.|$|E

It was slated for release on the 64DD, a disk drive {{expansion}} peripheral for the Nintendo 64. Itoi's expansive ideas during development led the development team {{to question whether}} fans would <b>still</b> <b>consider</b> the game part of the series. The game entered development hell and struggled to find a firm release date and in 2000, despite its level of completion, was later cancelled altogether with the commercial failure of the 64DD.|$|E

While trade in dolphins is internationally regulated, other aspects of keeping dolphins in captivity, such as the minimum size and characteristics of pools, vary among countries. Though animal welfare is perceived to have improved significantly over the last few decades, many animal rights groups <b>still</b> <b>consider</b> keeping dolphins captive to be a form of animal abuse.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War Millwall's {{form was}} {{poor and the}} club dropped into the Third and Fourth Division of the Football League. West Ham have never played below the Second Division in their history and often played a league or two above Millwall. The two sides did not play each other {{competitively}} between 13 October 1959 and 7 October 1978, making the 1960s the only decade the teams have not met. Despite the infrequency of their meetings, both sets of supporters <b>still</b> <b>consider</b> the other club their major rival. During these years, the Hammers enjoyed considerable success, winning the FA Cup in 1964, 1975 and 1980. They also won the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1965. Over four decades the sides were only in the same tier of the Football League for three seasons, in 1946–47, 1947–48 and 1978–79. They played two cup games {{against each other in}} the Southern Professional Floodlit Cup in 1959 and the Full Members Cup in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{game that}} used a {{graphical}} display, the cathode-ray tube amusement device is generally not considered under most definitions to {{be a candidate for}} the first video game, as it used purely analog hardware and did not run on a computing device; some loose definitions may <b>still</b> <b>consider</b> it a video game, but it is still usually disqualified as the device was never manufactured. Nevertheless, it is the earliest known interactive electronic game as well as the first to incorporate an electronic display, thus making it a forerunner to other games in the early history of video games. As the device was never manufactured or widely shown, however, it did not directly inspire any other games and had no impact on the future video game industry.|$|E

Before the First World War the teams met 60 times in just 16 years, mostly in the Southern and Western Football Leagues. They have played a total of 39 times in league and cup {{competitions}} since 1916. The teams have usually competed in different divisions, spending only 12 seasons in the same tier of the Football League. Even so, the derbies have retained their passion and both sets of supporters <b>still</b> <b>consider</b> the other club their main rival. They last played {{against each other in}} the 2011–12 Championship. As of the 2017–18 season, West Ham play in the Premier League and Millwall play in the Championship, the tier below.|$|E
