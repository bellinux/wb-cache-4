5000|$|A short {{stretch of}} this is visible in South Norwood at Heavers' Meadow, near Selhurst railway station, where the brook {{can be seen in}} a {{concrete}} channel next to the British Rail works as it runs north west along the bottom of the site before disappearing beneath Selhurst Road. It is fenced off here because it can be very dangerous, especially after a rain storm, where the water level can rise several feet in a few minutes as the water rapidly drains from the roads and hard surfaces around and into the <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>drain.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most of Burleson {{lies between}} 700 and 800 feet (213 to 243 meters) in elevation. The <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>drains</b> into the Trinity River basin.|$|R
50|$|The brook is fenced {{off because}} it can be very dangerous; after a rain storm the water level can rise several feet in a few minutes as the <b>water</b> rapidly <b>drains</b> from the roads and hard {{surfaces}} around and into the <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>drains.</b>|$|R
50|$|By 1900, all six {{strands of}} the brook and {{drainage}} dykes {{had been covered}} over and formed the most useful depressions available in which to site the neighbourhood's sewers, many diversionary <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>drains</b> had been created closer to the surface to drain the catchment basin.|$|R
50|$|Sunbury-on-Thames and Staines civil parishes in {{the former}} Sanitary District saw the Staines Rural Sanitary District's very slow {{progress}} in installing drainage as backward. Indeed, the ineffective taxation and implementation of many such bodies {{was one of the}} main prompts for members of Parliament supporting the Local Government Act 1894, which introduced a second tier of local government six years after the deemed success of the administrative county introduction in 1888. Rate-raising and well-managed foul sewer and <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>drain</b> construction was swift in the two Urban Districts and in the Rural District from 1894.|$|E
50|$|Water {{collected}} by a rain gutter is fed, usually via a downpipe (also called a leader or conductor), {{from the roof}} edge {{to the base of}} the building where it is either discharged or collected. The down pipe can terminate in a shoe and discharge directly onto the surface, but using modern construction techniques would be connected through an inspection chamber to a drain that led to a <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>drain</b> or soakaway. Alternatively it would connect via a gulley (u-bend) with 50mm water seal to a combined drain. Water from rain gutters may be harvested in a rain barrel or a cistern.|$|E
50|$|Bretton {{used to be}} {{connected}} via road link to Broughton via Bretton Bridge. This was an old railway bridge that existed until {{the creation of the}} Broughton Park shopping complex. The bridge is now a public footpath with flagpoles at its summit. It is also of interest to note that in the late 1980s, residents in the Boulevard, Broughton have found remains of railway sleepers in rear gardens, from when the railway connected the villages of Broughton and Kinnerton. From the top of Bretton Bridge, the route of the former railway can be discerned. Part of the former trackbed is now a <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>drain</b> within the country park in Broughton.|$|E
50|$|Its {{depression}} {{has been}} conveniently used since the 19th century and {{rise of the}} water closet for the sanitation of the area by building a combined sewer underneath it and to prevent flooding, to construct where the Metropolitan Board of Works and London Boroughs have found affordable, separate <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>drains</b> leading to the Thames.|$|R
50|$|School {{children}} from Alperton Community School were {{also involved in}} an Active Citizen Scheme along with the Environment Agency, to remind people not to pollute the Wealdstone Brook and River Brent through the abuse of the street <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>drains</b> who conclude that littering, old plumbing and disposing of waste such as engine oil are destroying local fish spawning grounds.|$|R
50|$|Wielkopolska Region {{lies within}} the basin of the Oder River, 88% of the province's <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>drains</b> into the Warta river basin, and the {{remaining}} 12% is drained by a multitude of other river systems, including the Barycz, Ladislaus Trench and Obrzycy waterways. The quality of river waters is generally poor, but their condition is gradually improving and should soon be classed as 'clean'.|$|R
30|$|Penal {{regulations}} for violators of water laws were initiated. To implement these laws and to fulfill conditions resulting thereof, penalties of imprisonment and/or fine were imposed. Article 21 of the <b>Surface</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Drain</b> Law No. 15 {{for the year}} 1942 provided for a penalty not exceeding 1 -month imprisonment and/or payment of 10 -£ fine as a maximum [12].|$|E
40|$|Investigation of a {{small series}} of cases of typhoid fever {{infected}} in a river between 1963 and 1970 revealed that all were caused by a single source, a carrier of a rare phage type of Salmonella typhi. The contamination of the river resulted from an incorrect sewage connexion with a <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>drain</b> outfall into the river...|$|E
30|$|A {{number of}} {{articles}} in relevant legislations provided {{for the protection of}} water resources in agricultural areas. Passage of animals was also regulated across water installations such as pools and canals as provided for in Article 19 of the <b>Surface</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Drain</b> Law No. 15 for year 1942. ‘The Water Drain Official may regulate, through banning or any other means, animal or vehicle passage or crossing through special constructions of water drain conduits or their brims or canals’ [12].|$|E
50|$|Endorheic regions, in {{contrast}} to exorheic regions which flow to the ocean in geologically defined patterns, are closed hydrologic systems. Their <b>surface</b> <b>waters</b> <b>drain</b> to inland terminal locations where the water evaporates or seeps into the ground, having no access to discharge into the sea. Endorheic water bodies include {{some of the largest}} lakes in the world, such as the Caspian Sea, the world's largest saline inland sea.|$|R
25|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>drains</b> into Honduras' {{two primary}} {{drainage}} basins; the Atlantic sloping basin representing 82% of the country, and the Pacific sloping basin {{accounting for the}} remaining 13% of Honduras. Together, these two basins drain 106,714 km2 per year. Honduras has ample water availability with annual renewable water resources at 13,766 m3 per capita; well above the world per capita average of 8,467 m3 per year or other Latin American countries at 6,739 m3 per year.|$|R
40|$|Nitrate (NO 3 −) {{is often}} {{observed}} in <b>surface</b> <b>waters</b> <b>draining</b> terrestrial ecosystems that remain strongly nitrogen (N) limited. It {{has been suggested}} that this occurs due to hydrological bypassing of soil or vegetation N retention, particularly during high flows.

40|$|This is {{the report}} from the Mersey and Weaver Fisheries Advisory Committee meeting, which was held on the 19 th January, 1977. The report {{contains}} information {{the construction of a}} new <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>drain</b> to Pennington Flash, fisheries activities, fish stocking, eel fishing and estuarial waters, and infectious Pancreatic Necrosis. The section on fisheries activities includes brown/rainbow trout, roach, perch, bream, carp, tench and rudd stocking and fish mortalities. The section on Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis highlights its prevention on imports of salmonid fish and ova. The Fisheries Advisory Committee was part of the Regional Water Authorities, in this case the North West Water Authority. This preceded the Environment Agency which came into existence in 1996. ...|$|E
30|$|The High Commissioner is {{the source}} of {{legislations}} related to <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>drain</b> according to Article 4 of the Water Drain Law. This Article provides that ‘the High Commissioner may declare any area to which this article applies as a water drain area’ [12]. Clause 1 of Article 5 of the same Law provides that ‘the water supervisor may prevent establishment of any barrier or practice agriculture in any of these areas’ [12]. Article 4 of the aforesaid law indicates that a barrier in a watercourse includes any agricultural activity such as any excavations, irrigation ditches or drainage of stream banks and riverbanks. It also includes different aspects causing hygienic hazards or disturbing public peace as this land may be declared as water drain area [12].|$|E

50|$|The Continental Divide {{branches}} to the desert's northwest and rejoins in the southeast, creating the Great Divide Basin, from which no <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>drains.</b> Steamboat Mountain and other desert mesas or buttes provide seeps and springs {{that serve as}} water sources for small streams, such as Jack Morrow Creek. While the basin's interior waters are intermittent, the desert is bounded to the west by the Green River and to the east by the North Platte River.|$|R
50|$|Use of City Airport by heavier {{aircraft}} is {{hampered by}} the soft peaty nature of the area, being {{at the edge of}} Chat Moss, and by the low-lying land and areas of nearby standing water encouraging fog. It would have needed much heavy work consolidating the ground (compare the struggle building the Liverpool and Manchester Railway across Chat Moss in 1826).During 2010-11, additional drainage was added to improve <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>draining,</b> due to the original clay pipes deteriorating and no longer functioning.|$|R
30|$|Groundwater {{table and}} depth of each {{borehole}} were measured in metre in the field using automatic water level indicator. Groundwater discharge was carried out with half horse power submersible pump, and the yield was measured in m 3 /day using ISO 4064 DN 20 water flow meter with accuracy of 0.1  l. The pipe was extended to nearby concrete <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>drains</b> to expel the discharge water beyond {{the vicinity of the}} pumped well so as to avoid artificial recharge of the pumped well.|$|R
5000|$|About 48.7% of the world's land drains to the Atlantic Ocean. In North America, <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>drains</b> to the Atlantic via the Saint Lawrence River and Great Lakes basins, the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, the Canadian Maritimes, {{and most}} of Newfoundland and Labrador. Nearly all of South America east of the Andes also drains to the Atlantic, as does most of Western and Central Europe and the {{greatest}} portion of western Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as Western Sahara and part of Morocco.

5000|$|To allow <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> to <b>drain</b> freely {{across the}} path of the aqueduct, {{inverted}} siphons were installed at fifty-six locations. Freezing was prevented by ensuring the outlet level was always below water level, preventing cold air from entering the siphon.|$|R
50|$|In redeveloping the Isle of Dogs and Royal Docks {{areas of}} east London {{during the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, the London Docklands Development Corporation {{invested}} in major new drainage infrastructure to manage future sewage and <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> run-off from proposed developments. Consulting engineer Sir William Halcrow & Partners designed a system of large diameter tunnels served by new pumping stations. In the Royal Docks, approximately 16 miles (25 km) of foul and <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>drains</b> were built, plus pumping stations at Tidal Basin (designed by Richard Rogers Partnership) and North Woolwich (architect: Nicholas Grimshaw). The Isle of Dogs drainage network is served by a stormwater pumping station situated in Stewart Street, designed by John Outram Associates.|$|R
50|$|The Westbourne or Kilburn is a mainly re-diverted small River Thames {{tributary}} in London, primarily sourced from Whitestone Pond, Hampstead Heath and which, notwithstanding {{one main}} meander, flows southward through Kilburn and the Bayswater (west end of Paddington) to skirt underneath {{the east of}} Hyde Park's Serpentine lake then through central Chelsea under Sloane Square and it passes centrally under {{the south side of}} Royal Hospital Chelsea's Ranelagh Gardens before historically discharging into the Inner London Tideway. Since the latter 19th century its narrow basin has been further narrowed by corollary <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>drains</b> and its main flow has been replaced with a combined sewer beneath its route.|$|R

50|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>drains</b> via moulins to a {{subglacial}} {{system of}} conduits which allow flow into cavities in the ice. As the flow increases the head {{loss in the}} conduits increases, resulting in increasing water levels and correspondingly higher hydraulic pressure at the headwall of the glacier. As the conduits pressurize, they pressurize the cavities and the porous basal till. The pressurization backs water up within the glacier and the increased pressure at the bed, reduces the pressure the ice exerts against the bed (referred to as the effective pressure at the bed). Since friction with the bed {{is proportional to the}} effective pressure at the bed, this pressurization promotes basal motion of the glacier.|$|R
40|$|The role of <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> {{drainage}} {{in environmental}} change in Australia is rarely appreciated. <b>Drains</b> can modify <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> hydrology, not only altering flow regimes but also rapidly dispersing contaminants and altering the natural hydrological balance of associated flora and fauna. Yet drainage {{continues to be}} considered a viable management strategy rather than as a cause of land degradation. The impact of <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> drainage in an inherently saline area of South Australia, the Upper South East, is investigated. <b>Surface</b> <b>water</b> <b>drains</b> were constructed by developers in an attempt to increase the area of land available and viable for agricultural land use. Drainage strategies altered the natural direction, magnitude and frequency of <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> flow. The Upper South East has experienced periods of both increased <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> and flooding, and <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> deficit, in the past one hundred years. The region now receives less <b>surface</b> <b>water</b> than under pre-European conditions, but local runoff is channelled into and through the wetlands more rapidly than before European settlement.
