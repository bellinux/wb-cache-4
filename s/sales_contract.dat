5|$|Rochell's early Grapico {{efforts were}} not without problems. For example, in November 1921, Grapico Bottling Works {{acquired}} a US$648 Baltimore Semi-Automatic Machine, Model B-1485 from New Orleans based Crown Cork and Seal Co. to cork and seal soda water bottles. Within three months, the bottle capper began to fail. Frequently, {{the neck of}} the moving bottles became stuck in the machine, which additionally broke bottles whose contents drenched workers. In addition, the caps made by the machine did not seal properly so that carbonation gas escaped from the Grapico bottles. After Grapico refused to pay the US$358 balance, the Sheriff seized the bottling machine from Grapico. The matter was resolved 3½ years later by the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal, who set aside the machine <b>sales</b> <b>contract</b> so that Grapico Bottling Works no longer owed the balance.|$|E
25|$|A {{series of}} {{financial}} difficulties caused by Lavalin's rapid expansion {{led to its}} bankruptcy. A clause in the original <b>sales</b> <b>contract</b> returned UTDC to Ontario crown control, and they quickly sold it to Bombardier in 1991. Bombardier started a redesign effort for the ICTS, resulting in the larger, advanced rapid transit (ART) Mark II vehicle. Compared to the original ICTS (retroactively named Mark I), the newer ART cars are longer with more seating, and have a more open layout inside.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} email conversations {{between members of}} Bennett's group {{prompted}} former Sonics' owner Howard Schultz to file a lawsuit that sought to rescind {{the sale of the}} team and alleged that Bennett's group used fraud and misrepresentation to purchase the Sonics without making a [...] "good faith best effort" [...] to keep them in Seattle as mandated by the original <b>sales</b> <b>contract.</b> Bennett said the emails were misinterpreted and that he had spent millions of dollars in attempting to keep the team in Seattle.|$|E

40|$|If the Common European Sales Law (CESL) is adopted, {{commercial}} {{parties will}} have the opportunity to choose between two international legal instruments for the regulation of their international commercial <b>sales</b> <b>contracts.</b> Whereas CESL is available to both consumer and commercial <b>sales</b> <b>contracts,</b> the Vienna <b>Sales</b> Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG) is intended for commercial <b>sales</b> <b>contracts</b> only. This could suggest that CISG is more suitable for use in commercial <b>sales</b> <b>contracts,</b> as commercial parties usually have different interests compared to consumers. In this article, it is argued that, as CESL remedies major flaws in CISG, in fact CESL is the better choice (also) for commercial parties, in particular because it introduces coherent rules on defects of consent, clearer and more balanced rules regarding the incorporation of standard terms, and a scheme for the testing of the unfairness of standard terms...|$|R
500|$|As {{lawyer for}} the UGG, Brownlee began to sympathize with the {{prevailing}} farmers' view that the eastern Canadian business establishment was hostile to their interests (for example, when the UGG wanted to sell twine, no manufacturer would supply it). [...] He recommended that the UGG reduce farmers' reliance on the eastern establishment by expanding its operations into insurance, investment, and real estate. [...] The result was the United Grain Growers Securities Ltd. [...] He also helped the UGG quietly sell the stock it held in the Home Bank of Canada when UGG directors began to doubt the bank's soundness; this subtlety was considered essential, as the directors were concerned that airing their doubts publicly would make the bank's failure a self-fulfilling prophecy. [...] When UGG Assistant General Manager J. R. Murray found an interested buyer, Brownlee advised Murray against insisting on an intricate written <b>sales</b> <b>contract</b> for fear that the buyer would sense the directors' concerns. [...] His advice was heeded, and the sale was concluded December 29, 1919. [...] The bank failed less than four years later.|$|E

[...] On 29 December 2011, the U.S. signed a $29.4 billion contract to sell 84 F-15s in the SA (Saudi Advanced) configuration. The sale includes upgrades {{for the older}} F-15Ss up to the SA standard and related equipment and services.

James Lingk enters the office, looking for Ricky Roma. Lingk's wife has ordered him to cancel the <b>sales</b> <b>contract</b> he signed with Roma. Roma attempts to smooth-talk Lingk into not canceling the contract, informing Lingk that his check {{has not yet been}} brought to the bank; this begins to have its intended calming effect on Lingk, who is clearly agitated. Levene supports the ruse, but Williamson, thinking Lingk is worried about the safety of his check, accidentally ruins Roma's ploy when he tells Lingk that his check has just been deposited.

2500|$|In 1971, Fender {{employees}} Forrest White and Tom Walker, {{unhappy with}} the way CBS was managing the company, left their positions with Fender {{to start their own}} venture. First known as Tri-Sonix, Inc (often incorrectly referred to as [...] "Tri-Sonic") and then later Musitek, Inc., the new company eventually settled on the name of MusicMan, Inc. by 1974. The company began producing a hybrid tube-solid state amplifier co-designed by Tom Walker and Leo Fender, who was participating as a silent partner to the firm due to a [...] "no compete" [...] clause in the <b>sales</b> <b>contract</b> Fender had signed when he sold his original company to CBS in 1965. After the clause expired in 1975, he was made president of MusicMan, Inc., and by 1976 his consulting firm CLF Research had begun producing instruments bearing the MusicMan name.|$|E
2500|$|Title {{insurers}} {{conduct a}} title search on public records before {{they agree to}} insure the purchaser or mortgagee of land. [...] Specifically, after a real estate <b>sales</b> <b>contract</b> has been executed and escrow opened, a title professional will search the public records to look for any problems with the home's title. This search typically involves a review of land records going back many years. More than one-third of all title searches reveal a title problem that title professionals will insist on fixing before the transaction closes. For instance, a previous owner may have had minor construction done on the property, but never fully paid the contractor (resulting in a mechanic's lien), or the previous owner may have failed to pay local or state taxes (resulting in a tax lien). Title professionals seek to resolve problems like these before the transaction closes, since otherwise, their employer, the title insurer, {{will be required to}} fix such title defects by paying such unpaid fees or taxes.|$|E
2500|$|The first Roman emperor, Augustus, framed his {{ascent to}} sole {{power as a}} return to {{traditional}} morality, and attempted to regulate the conduct of women through moral legislation. Adultery, which had been a private family matter under the Republic, was criminalized, and defined broadly as an illicit sex act (stuprum) that occurred between a male citizen and a married woman, or between a married woman and any man other than her husband. Therefore, a married woman could have sex only with her husband, but a married man did not commit adultery when {{he had sex with}} a prostitute, slave, or person of marginalized status (infamis). Most prostitutes in ancient Rome were slaves, though some slaves were protected from forced prostitution by a clause in their <b>sales</b> <b>contract.</b> A free woman who worked as a prostitute or entertainer lost her social standing and became infamis, [...] "disreputable"; by making her body publicly available, she had in effect surrendered her right to be protected from sexual abuse or physical violence.|$|E

For purposes of defining the object, will be specifically studied the anticipated <b>sale</b> <b>contract</b> of soybeans, popularly known in Brazil as "sale contract of green soybeans". We demonstrate that the contract breaches made in court greatly encumber the Brazilian agribusiness, imposing worst trading conditions for future operations to farmers, mainly due to the loss of confidence. 201...|$|R
40|$|Cleared transit may {{be carried}} out within {{different}} legal constructions, including two functionally interconncted <b>sale</b> <b>contracts</b> of which one is concluded between the actual deliverer and the clearing transitor and the other between the clearing transitor and the actual receiver. The article presents the analysis of civil law relations between the participants of cleared transit, especially between the parties {{to each of the}} <b>sale</b> <b>contracts.</b> Special {{attention has been paid to}} specific features of <b>sale</b> <b>contracts</b> consulted in order to create formal frame of cleared transit (e. g. the problem of delivery and receipt of a thing within each of the <b>sale</b> <b>contracts,</b> the question of the transfer of ownership, the due time and payment of a price). An autonomous character of each of the <b>sale</b> <b>contracts</b> has been stressed, despite the existing functional connections. Besides, the author pointed out to the raising of claims against the actual deliverer on the basis of warranty (which in relations between the units of the socialized economy in some situations allows to address claims to the producer even by a person who was not the contracting party of the producer), guarantee and torts.
