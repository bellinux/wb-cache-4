5|$|Competing at {{her first}} Summer Olympic Games, Pramila Rijal {{was the oldest}} person to compete for Nepal at the London Olympic Games {{at the age of}} 27. She {{attained}} qualification to the Games {{with the use of a}} wildcard because she had not set any previous time for her event, the 100 metres. Rijal revealed that she had problems with the <b>starting</b> <b>block</b> but hoped the training in Kent would aid her in setting a new Nepalese national record. She took part in the event's fourth heat on 3 August, finishing sixth out of nine competitors, with a time of 13.33 seconds. The result was attributed to Rajal having back pain in the days before the event and required painkillers to help her cope. She finished in front of Janice Alatoa of Vanuatu (13.60 seconds) and Mihter Wendolin from Micronesia (13.67 seconds) but behind Lidiane Lopes of Cape Verde (12.72 seconds) in a heat led by Papua New Guinea's Toea Wisil (11.60 seconds). Rajal finished 71st out of 78 runners overall, and was 1.11 seconds slower than the slowest competitor who advanced to the first round and did not make the later rounds.|$|E
5|$|Rules for the Olympic {{skeleton}} competitions {{were set}} by the FIBT and the International Olympic Committee (IOC). They entrusted four to seven officials with making decisions regarding competition rules: one or two technical delegates, a jury president, two jury members, and two optional jury assistants. These decisions were implemented and enforced by a race director, to whom the overall responsibility for running the competition was given. Under the rules, competitors were guaranteed a minimum of six official training runs in the days prior to the competition. The competition itself consisted of four heats, with the starting order of athletes determined by their FIBT rankings {{prior to the start}} of the Games. Athletes began their runs on their sleds at a <b>starting</b> <b>block,</b> ran briefly while holding their sleds, and then laid on their stomachs on the sleds through the remainder of the course. Athletes were ranked by the speed of their times between their start and when they crossed the finish line at the bottom of the track.|$|E

50|$|Athletes in {{this class}} are not {{required}} to use a <b>starting</b> <b>block.</b> It is up to the individual. They have the option to start from a crouch, from a standing position or 3 point stance. In track events, officials are encouraged to avoid keeping these athletes in the <b>starting</b> <b>block</b> too long. Because of their condition, athletes may make movements that normally would disqualify them as a false start. If an official believes movement could be a result of this, they can restart the entire field without disqualifying and runners.|$|E

50|$|Based on {{the speed}} of the runners, the {{generally}} accepted strategy used in setting up a 4-person relay team is: second-fastest, third-fastest, slowest, then fastest (anchor).

But if a runner is better in the <b>starting</b> <b>blocks</b> than the others, he is sometimes moved to the first spot because it is the only spot that uses <b>starting</b> <b>blocks.</b>|$|R
