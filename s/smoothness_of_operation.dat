Timeliness is an important requirement to ensure user interface responsiveness and the <b>smoothness</b> <b>of</b> multimedia <b>operations.</b> Overload can occur when applications ask for more computation time than the machine can offer. Interactive systems have to handle overload situations dynamically at runtime. ATLAS provides timely service to applications, accessible through an easy-to-use interface. Deadlines specify timing requirements, workload metrics describe jobs. ATLAS employs machine learning to predict job execution times.

In this paper, a fuzzification scheme is proposed to fuzzify the static standard time so as to incorporate some uncertainties, in terms of both job-specific and human related factors, into the fabric-cutting scheduling problem. A genetic optimisation procedure is also proposed to search for fault-tolerant schedules using genetic algorithms, such that makespan and scheduling uncertainties are minimised. Two sets of real production data were collected to validate the proposed method. Experimental results indicate that the genetically optimised fault-tolerant schedules not only improve the operation performance but also minimise the scheduling risks.

40|$|In apparel manufacturing, {{accurate}} upstream fabric-cutting {{planning is}} crucial for the <b>smoothness</b> <b>of</b> downstream sewing <b>operations.</b> Effective and reliable fabric-cutting schedules are difficult to obtain because the apparel manufacturing environment is fuzzy and dynamic.

The proposed method is demonstrated by two cases with production data collected from a Hong Kong-owned garment production plant in China. Results of the two cases preliminarily show that the genetically improved fault-tolerant schedules effectively satisfy the demand for downstream production units, guarantee consistent and reliable system performance, and also reduce production costs through reduced operator idle time.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our {{purpose was}} to {{evaluate}} in a sheep model for endoscopic fetal surgery the impact of nitrous oxide-gas amniodistention compared with fluid amniodistention on duration of surgery, hemorrhagic events, and fetomaternal acid-base status. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant ewes (n = 16) at 92 to 104 days of gestation (term, 145 days) underwent amniodistention with Hartmann's solution (group I, n = 8) or nitrous oxide (group II, n = 8) at 38 degrees C. Endoscopic tracheal clipping according to a standardized surgical protocol was performed in all animals. The duration of fetoscopy (from insertion of first cannula until removal of last one), fetal surgery (fetal skin incision to skin closure), and number of bleeding episodes was recorded. Maternal and fetal blood gas values (pH, PO 2, and PCO 2) were measured at baseline and every 15 minutes during the experiment. Videotapes <b>of</b> the <b>operations</b> were assessed independently and scored by a visual analog scale in terms <b>of</b> <b>smoothness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>operation</b> and control <b>of</b> hemorrhagic events. RESULTS: Mean duration of fetoscopy (+/-SEM) (68 +/- 16 minutes vs 92 +/- 23 minutes) and fetal surgery (19 +/- 6 minutes vs 42 +/- 18 minutes) as well as number of bleeding episodes (1. 9 +/- 0. 8 minutes vs 5. 8 +/- 2. 1 minutes) was significantly reduced in animals operated with use of nitrous oxide amniodistention. In both groups, fetal and maternal blood gases remained unchanged during the entire experiment. Visual analog scale (VAS) scores were significantly higher for procedures conducted with use of gas distention. CONCLUSION: In a lamb model for fetal surgery, gas amniodistention with use of nitrous oxide results in a quicker operation procedure with less bleeding compared with fluid amniodistention, and without adverse side effects on fetomaternal acid-base status. status: publishe...|$|R

Brayton engines ( [...] called [...] "Ready Motors" [...] were made from 1872 - 1876) and {{were one of the}} first engines to {{successfully}} use compression and combust fuel in the cylinder. Prior to this time the commercial engines available had been the Lenoir engine from 1860, a non - compression engine which worked on a double-acting 2-stroke cycle, but spent half of each stroke drawing gas into the cylinder. The Hugon engine was a slightly improved version, but both were quite inefficient (95 and 85 cubic feet of gas per HP hour respectively). The next commercial engine available (from 1867) was the Otto & Langen a non compression, free piston engine, which used atmospheric pressure for the power stroke, and consumed about 1/2 the gas of the Lenoir and Hugon engines. It was in May 1876 that Otto developed his engine using the single-acting 4-stroke cycle with compression in the cylinder. Clerk decided to develop an engine using compression, but with the 2-stroke cycle, as he could see benefit to weight and <b>smoothness</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> through having twice as many power strokes.|$|E
