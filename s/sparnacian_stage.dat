The 13 C (negative) carbon isotope excursion (CIE) associated with the Paleocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum(PETM) in marine sections at the NP 9 a/b calcareous nannoplankton zonal boundary and also in terrestrial stratigraphies, occurs in the Mortemer Formation, below the Vaugirard Formation. Moreover, a characteristic isotopic signature with stratigraphically successive negative and positive peaks permits a refinement in correlation betweeen the diverse members of the Mont Bernon Group. The strongly positive values (in upper Zone NP 9) {{are found in the}} Meudon Member (Conglomérat de Meudon). These results imply that: (1) the Meudon Member constitutes the base of the Vaugirard Formation, but not the base of the Sparnacian "Stage"; (2) the mammal fauna of the Meudon Member (=late Biochron NP 9) is somewhat younger than that of the basal Wasatchian North American Land Mammal Age (NALMA; which is stratigraphically correlative with, or even slightly older than, mid-Biochron NP 9); (3) the base of the Sparnacian "Stage" of the Paris Basin is slightly older than the base of the Wasatchian NALMA and only marginally younger than the Chron C 24 r/C 25 n boundary. Moreover, the carbon isotopic signature suggests correlation of the Reading 1 beds/facies of the London Basin with the Mortemer Formation and Reading 2 beds with {{the lower part of the}} Vaugirard Formation of the Paris Basin. With the recognition that the Sparnacian is confined to the ca. 0. 85 m. y. -long stratigraphic interval between the CIE at its base and the FAD of Tribrachiatus digitalis at the base of the Ypresian, and that it is inappropriate to lower the base of the Ypresian Stage by about 1 m. y., we recommend (re) insertion of the <b>Sparnacian</b> <b>Stage</b> as the basal stage of the Eocene Series...|$|E
40|$|Integrated {{research}} {{over the}} past decade has led to the recognition of a short (150 - 200 k. y.) interval of Paleogene time within Chron C 24 r at ~ 55. 5 Ma, formerly termed the late Paleocene Thermal Maximum (LPTM) but more recently the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), that was crucial in the climatic, paleoceanographic, and biotic evolution of our planet. Stable isotope analysis of marine carbonates indicates that there were transient changes in surface and deep-water temperatures. These climatic changes coincided with a negative 3 %- 4 % carbon isotope excursion (CIE), which is recorded in both marine and terrestrial deposits. It was soon realized that the CIE not only constitutes a powerful tool for long distance ("global") isochronous correlation, but even more importantly that it is coeval with notable biotic events in both marine and continental fossil records that have long been taken as criteria for the beginning of the Eocene in North America and more recently in deep sea cores. On the other hand, the conventional Paleocene/Eocene boundary level at the Thanetian/Ypresian boundary in Belgium and the London Basin {{has been found to be}} ~ 1 m. y. younger than the CIE, based on the association of the First Appearance Datum (FAD) of the (calcareous nannoplankton) Tribrachiatus digitalis (at ~ 54. 4 Ma) with the base of the Ypresian in the London Basin. Although the Ypresian definition would take priority under normal circumstances, a consensus has been reached to redefine the Eocene in recognition of the worldwide significance and correlatibility of stratigraphic features associated with the PETM. Redefinition of the Eocene, however desirable, nevertheless cannot proceed in a stratigraphic vacuum, and this paper is concerned with resolving the consequences of this action. To be made coincident with the CIE at ~ 55. 5 Ma, the Ypresian/Thanetian boundary would have to be lowered by ~ 1 m. y., resulting in the inflation of the span of the Ypresian by 20 % and a reduction of the span of the Thanetian by 30 %. At the same time, the terminology of the strata in the leapfrogged interval would be thrown into total conflict with the literature, with the substitution of one widely used stage name for the other in the conflicted interval. On the other hand, to relocate the Paleocene/Eocene boundary without moving the stage boundaries would result in the upper third of the Thanetian falling within the Eocene, demolishing a century-old consensus. We propose that the destabilizing effect of the new boundary in the classic chronostratigraphy of western Europe can best be minimized with the introduction of a pre-Ypresian Stage, to encompass the orphaned upper Thanetian interval as the basal unit of the Eocene under a separate name. To this end, we suggest the reintroduction of the <b>Sparnacian</b> <b>Stage,</b> now that its original concept has been shown to correlate essentially with the interval between the CIE and the FAD of T. digitalis...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Paris Basin {{represents}} an historical cradle of the Paleogene stratigraphy, where the Paleocene Epoch and the "Sparnacian Stage" have been erected (Schimper, 1874; Dollfus, 1880). As highlighted by Aubry et al. (2005), whereas the chronostratigraphic connotation of the <b>Sparnacian</b> <b>Stage</b> occurred to be controversial since its definition, modern {{studies of the}} Late Paleocene - Early Eocene interval have revealed that the so-called "Sparnacian" deposits encompass a remarkable and short (~ 170 kyr) episode in the Cenozoic history, the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, ~ 55. 8 - 55. 6 Ma). However, due to a large development of diverse and laterally variable, predominantly lagoonal and non-marine facies, the Paris Basin Upper Paleocene-Lower Eocene succession is still poorly documented and needs an updated chronostratigraphic correlation with other Paleogene records in adjacent basins and worldwide. Since almost 45 years the dinoflagellate cyst stratigraphy has significantly contributed to correlations of the Thanetian-Ypresian deposits in the Paris and adjacent basins (Châteauneuf & Gruas-Cavagnetto, 1968, 1978; Gruas-Cavagnetto, 1974; Costa and Downie, 1976). Nevertheless, data published on dinoflagellate cysts distribution in the Paleogene sediments of those basins remain too scattered (see Aubry et al., 2005) {{and need to be}} calibrated to the most recent biozonations. With the aim at reconstructing the "Sparnacian" palaeoenvironments as well as ensuring correlation with the PETM (and its Carbon Isotopic Excursion, CIE) events and related processes, new or already well known "Sparnacian" Dieppe-Hampshire and Paris Basins key localities (Cap d'Ailly and Sotteville-sur-Mer sections, Therdonne and Sinceny cores) have been investigated in details palynologically and chemostratigraphically. According to our new high-resolution data, the CIE begins within the Mortemer Fm in terrestrial or coastal environments and continues until the top of the Soissonnais Fm (Quesnel et al, this meeting). Within the CIE, δ 13 Corg values fluctuate between - 25 and - 30 ‰, while above and below they fluctuate between - 22 and - 26 ‰. The CIE interval contained in the lagoonal and shallow marine units reveals an extremely pronounced (compared with other PETM records worldwide) Apectodinium-acme (70 - 98 % of dinocyst assemblage), sometimes accompanied by Pediastrum-blooms (fresh water algae). As mentioned by Gruas-Cavagnetto (1974), dinoflagellate assemblages from the Dieppe-Hampshire and Paris Basins "Sparnacian" do not contain the key species Apectodinium augustum (nominate species of the A. augustum zone corresponding the PETM-interval worldwide, Crouch et al., 2001), whereas it is present in the northern Belgian Basin Tienen Fm (De Coninck, 1975, 1999) and is coeval there with the CIE and Apectodinium-acme interval (Steurbaut et al., 2000, 2003). However, our calibration of the Apectodinium-acme to the CIE in the Dieppe-Hampshire and Paris Basins suggests its attribution to the A. augustum zone. As it was previously noted from southern England (Powell et al., 1996), the absence of species A. augustum in the Anglo-Paris Basin may be explained by its restriction to more offshore conditions. In localities studied here dinocyst assemblages dominated by Apectodinium spp. are characterized by a significant number of longer (compared to the holotype) specimens of A. parvum, which could represent an ecological onshore substitute of species A. augustum during the PETM...|$|E
