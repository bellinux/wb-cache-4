Key evolution trends are expressible in power law form, allowing compact and efficient description of the process. Slip ratio and slip index according to Varenberg et al.

Evolution observed admits interpretation in terms of a Kachanov-type damage parameter {{as a function of the}} accumulated reciprocal sliding distance (ARSD). Fretting wear tests were performed on <b>samples</b> <b>of</b> dry film <b>lubricant</b> coatings (diamond-like carbon (DLC) and MoS 2 -containing coatings). Flat-and-rounded contact geometry was used to simulate the conditions observed in aero-engine components. Various pre-treatments (shot peening and grit blasting) were considered.

40|$|Problem statement: In general, {{engine oil}} is usually changed {{as defined by}} car or {{lubricant}} manufacturers, which is according to mileage. However, it was found from past researches that, at the predefined mileage or timeframe, most lubricant is still acceptably usable and efficient. Approach: This research aimed to calculate useful life <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> {{in order to reach}} its maximum usefulness. The method of study began by collecting data that indicates deterioration <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> by increasing mileage which includes total base number, viscosity, iron and flash point. Then the data was analyzed by means of Analysis Hierarchy Process (AHP).

40|$|This {{preliminary}} {{study on the}} maintenance <b>of</b> industrial <b>lubricants</b> for chemical plant investigated appropriate maintenance through condition monitoring <b>of</b> the <b>lubricants,</b> in particular autoxidation of base oil as the major degradation process. Changes in chemical and physical properties caused by the autoxidation of hydrocarbons were considered in terms of reaction sequence. The roles of antioxidants for maintaining the quality <b>of</b> <b>lubricants</b> were also considered. The reaction mechanism suggested the importance <b>of</b> antioxidants in <b>lubricants</b> during service. Therefore, a new method to diagnose consumption of antioxidant was required. Organic peroxides are reactive species generated during the autoxidation of hydrocarbons at the initial stage and can be quantitatively analyzed by iodometric titration. The peroxide value (POV) is proposed as a new parameter to monitor conditions <b>of</b> <b>lubricants.</b> The POV trace was examined by a model oxidation test <b>of</b> <b>lubricant</b> in the laboratory.
