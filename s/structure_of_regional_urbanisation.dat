40|$|A form of {{metropolitan}} government in Italy was originally introduced in 1990. After 25 years, {{the approval of}} Law 56 / 2014 has opened a new season of experimentation, full of expectations {{but at the same}} time not exempt from critique. The paper presents and discusses the elements of innovation and path-dependency that have shaped the current normative framework, explaining in particular the climate under which the new law was adopted. The author critically focuses on three main problematic aspects of the law that institutes the new città metropolitana, i. [*]e. the definition of boundaries, the nature of the new institution, and its competences and tools for action, considering their ability to deal with the challenges related to the processes <b>of</b> <b>regional</b> <b>urbanisation</b> affecting contemporary Italy...|$|R
40|$|Using a novel {{data set}} for 207 European regions from 22 {{different}} countries, we analyse {{the relevance of}} urbanisation for the short-term resilience to a major shock. We take the Great Recession, the economic and financial crisis that started in 2008, as our shock and analyse how the European NUTS 2 regions differ in their short-run resilience in the aftermath to the crisis in terms of unemployment and real GDP per capita. We find that the degree and nature <b>of</b> <b>regional</b> <b>urbanisation</b> is important for resilience. EU regions with a relatively large share {{of the population in}} commuting areas are relatively more resilient. In addition, regions with a large output share in medium-high tech industries were also less affected by the crisis...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to analyze}} the interaction between equalization funds, regional financial and human development index in East Java Province, Indonesia for 2008 – 2011. The method of analyze is Partial Least Square (PLS). The dependent variable used is equalization funds {{as a proxy for}} fiscal decentralization while the intervening variable used is fiscal capacity, fiscal independent and <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>regional</b> government expenditure; the dependent variable used is human development index as proxy for social welfare live. The study revealed that equalization fund has a negative direct effect to fiscal capacity, fiscal capacity has a positive direct effect on financial independent, fiscal capacity has no negative direct effect on <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>regional</b> government expenditure, financial dependent has positive direct effect on human development index, financial dependent has a positive direct effect on <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>regional</b> government expenditure, and <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>regional</b> government expenditure has negative direct effect on human development index. Based on this conclusion, regional government must focus on allocating the equalization fund to serve the public good provision...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{tested a}} {{methodology}} for tracing eighteenth- and nineteenth-century migrants, {{based on the}} Cambridge Group reconstitution methods. It began with a sample from Whitbourne parish in the under-researched county of Herefordshire, investigating the effect <b>of</b> <b>regional</b> <b>urbanisation</b> and industrialisation on migration choices. Longitudinal family dispersal patterns were traced, and comparisons were made with studies in other regions. The method focused on out-migration, setting spatial mobility in its wider context, and increasing its representativeness by incorporating additional search strategies for less visible groups, including married women. A high tracing rate was achieved, and the method is proposed as a viable tool for analysing migration from small rural parishes which are considered unsuitable for conventional reconstitution studies. The west midlands industrial areas were not apparently a destination for this population until {{the second quarter of}} the nineteenth century, but there were early migrants to Worcester, London, and later to Cheltenham, Cheshire and elsewhere, especially for domestic service and urban service trades. Some familial trends were observable, and others related to land holding, occupation and geographical propinquity. Marriage and dependent children did not prevent migration, but literacy and transport networks were found to be strongly associated with occupational options and distances moved. ...|$|R
40|$|While {{developed}} economies {{have been}} experiencing renaissance <b>of</b> <b>regional</b> planning and development, Turkey faces revolutionary pressures in regional policy making compared to developed countries, yet these radical changes still fall behind the recent renaissance.

40|$|There are two {{principal}} theories of why countries or regions trade: comparative advantage and increasing returns to scale. Yet {{there is virtually}} no empirical work that assesses the relative importance of these two theories in accounting for production structure and trade. We use a framework that nests an increasing returns model of economic geography featuring "home market effects" with that of Heckscher-Ohlin. We employ these trade models to account for the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>regional</b> production in Japan. We find support for the existence of economic geography effects in eight of nineteen manufacturing sectors, including such important ones as transportation equipment, iron and steel, electrical machinery, and chemicals. Moreover, we find that these effects are economically very significant. The latter contrasts with the results of Davis and Weinstein (1996), which found scant economic significance of economic geography for the <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> OECD production. We conclude that while economic geography may explain little about the international <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> production, it is very important for understanding the <b>regional</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> production. <b>Regional</b> economics - Japan; Japan...|$|R
