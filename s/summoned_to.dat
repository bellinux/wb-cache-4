5|$|During the Second Barons' War, Boniface {{seems to}} have sided first with the English bishops against King Henry, but later he sided with Henry. In 1262, he went to France, where he excommunicated the barons {{opposing}} the king. He was not <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> the Parliament at London in January 1265 because he was abroad. On {{the triumph of the}} king's party in 1265, he returned to England, arriving there in May 1266.|$|E

5|$|In November 1167 Foliot was <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> Normandy, then {{ruled by}} Henry II, {{to meet with}} papal legates and the king. Roger of York, Hilary of Chichester, and Roger of Worcester were also <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> attend. After some {{discussion}} and argument, Henry appears to have agreed that the legates could judge both the king's case against Becket {{as well as the}} bishops' case. Henry also offered a compromise {{on the subject of the}} Constitutions of Clarendon, that the legates accepted. However, when the legates met with Becket on 18November, it quickly became apparent that Becket would not accept negotiations with the king nor accept the legates as judges of either case against him. As the legates had no mandate to compel Becket to accept them as judges, the negotiations came to an end with the king and bishops still appealing to the papacy.|$|E
5|$|The Sovereign is {{traditionally}} advised by various counsellors, including the peers of the realm. After the Norman conquest of England, peers were <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> form the magnum concilium, or Great Council, {{which was one}} of the four councils belonging to the Sovereign. The other three were the Privy Council, Parliament (which was called the commune concilium, or Common Council), and judges (who are considered counsellors of the Sovereign on legal matters).|$|E

5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden {{building was}} constructed each year, called Dover Castle, from which gunfire salutes were sounded during the competitions.

5|$|Edward IV died {{suddenly}} in April 1483, leaving his young son, Edward his heir and the Duke of Gloucester Lord Protector {{of the new}} king and the country. Although he had been <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> the parliament of January 1483, {{it is unlikely that}} Suffolk was in attendance at court at the time. Nor did he attend the dead king's funeral or interment. By July, the young king had been declared illegitimate; Suffolk was at Westminster Hall on 26 June 1483 when Gloucester claimed the throne, and he carried the royal sceptre at Richard's coronation. Suffolk's son, the Earl of Lincoln, was named as Richard III's heir to the throne when the king's own son, Edward of Middleham died in 1484. However, Suffolk did lose the Constableship of Wallinford and the Chiltern Hundreds to Lovell. In fact, Suffolk seems to have been no more favoured by Richard than he had been by Edward. In December 1483 Suffolk was <b>summoned</b> <b>to</b> the parliament which confirmed Richrd III's right to the throne, and the following year he undertook commissions of array in both Norfolk and Suffolk, as well as being part of the oyer and terminer which condemned the treasons of William Collingbourne in London.|$|E
