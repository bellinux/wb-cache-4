6000|$|A remark of {{a similar}} nature may be applied to most of those distinctions among propositions which {{are said to have}} {{reference}} to their modality; as, difference of tense or time; the sun did rise, the sun is rising, the sun will rise. These differences, like that between affirmation and negation, might be glossed over by considering the incident of time as a mere modification of the predicate: thus, The sun is an object having risen, The sun is an object now rising, The sun is an object to rise hereafter. But the simplification would be merely verbal. Past, present, and future, do not constitute so many different kinds of rising; they are designations belonging to the event asserted, to the sun’s rising to-day. They affect, not the predicate, but the applicability of the predicate to the particular subject. That which we affirm to be past, present, or future, is not what the subject signifies, nor what the predicate signifies, but specifically and expressly what the predication signifies; what is expressed only by the proposition as such, and not by either or both of the terms. Therefore the circumstance of time is properly considered as attaching to the copula, which is the sign of predication, and not to the predicate. If the <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> of such modifications as these, Cæsar may be dead; Cæsar is perhaps dead; it is possible that Cæsar is dead; it is only because these fall altogether under another head, being properly assertions not of any thing relating to the fact itself, but of the state of our own mind in regard to it; namely, our absence of disbelief of it. Thus “Cæsar may be dead” means “I am not sure that Cæsar is alive.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Regarding [...] "third" [...] variables, media {{violence}} {{researchers who}} argue for causal effects acknowledge that other variables {{may play a}} role in aggression (Bushman & Anderson, 2001) and that aggression is due to a confluence of variables. These variables are known as [...] "third variables" [...] and if found, would probably be mediator variables (which differ from moderator variables). A mediator variable could 'explain away' media violence effects, whereas a moderator variable cannot. For instance, some scholars contend that trait aggressiveness has been demonstrated to moderate media violence effects (Bushman), although in some studies [...] "trait aggression" [...] does appear to account for any link between media violence exposure and aggression. Other variables have also been found to moderate media violence effects (Bushman & Geen, 1990). Another issue is the way in which experimental studies deal with potential confounding variables. Researchers use random assignment to attempt to neutralize the effects of what commonly are cited as third variables (i.e. gender, trait aggressiveness, preference for violent media). Because experimental designs employ random assignment to conditions, the effect of such attributive variables on experimental results is assumed to be random (not systematic). However, the <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>said</b> for correlational studies, and failure to control for such variables in correlational studies limits the interpretation of such studies.

40|$|Overview. This study {{explains}} why the theory of transferable development rights, runs into difficulty {{because of the lack}} of legal bases and institutions for the transfer. The problem, in brief is that while ownership rights at a domestic level can be "un-bundled" though legal agreements such as leases or land zoning, the <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> accomplished across borders. This model runs into problems when applied to a case of international transfers, where there is no reciprocity (as in agreements where both countries agree to conserve similar portions of wetlands or forests). Transferring use-rights in land to a foreign entity could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> legally enforced. Swanson instead suggests that the model to adopt is that of the franchise, in which three parties are involved: the global community, owner states, and land-owners.

Such systems consist of an analog front-end to collect data, an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) {{to convert the}} collected data to digital form and a digital unit to process it. Though considerable amount of research has been performed to increase the reliability of digital blocks, the <b>same</b> <b>can</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> claimed for mixed signal blocks. The reliability enhancement which we employ starts with fault sensitivity analysis followed by redesign. The data obtained from the sensitivity analysis is used to grade blocks based on their sensitivity to faults. The highly sensitive blocks can then be replaced by more reliable alternatives. The improvement gained by opting for more robust implementations might be limited due {{to the number of}} possible implementations. In these cases alternative reliability enhancement techniques such as adding redundancy may provide further improvements. The steps involved in the reliability enhancement of ADCs are illustrated in this paper by first proposing a sensitivity analysis methodology for #-particle induced transients and then suggesting redesign techniques to improve the reliability of the ADC. A novel concept of node weights specific to #-particle transients is introduced which improves the accuracy of the sensitivity analysis. The fault simulations show that, using techniques such as alternative robust implementations, adding redundancy, pattern detection and transistor sizing, considerable improvements in reliability can be attained...|$|R

40|$|Sulfonamides (SAs), {{the oldest}} {{chemotherapeutic}} agents used for antimicrobial therapy, still {{play an important}} role in veterinary mass treatments. Consequently, traces of these compounds, alone or in combinations, have been repeatedly detected in the environment. Sulfamethazine (SMZ) deserves particular attention not only because it is the most used veterinary SA, but also due to its proven effects on fertility in mice and on thyroid hormone homeostasis in rats. In this study, after evaluating the acute toxicity to Daphnia magna of six veterinary SAs and trimethoprim (TMP), the additivity of SMZ to each other compound was tested using the isobologram method. Two reproduction tests on the same biological model were also performed in order to derive LOEC and NOEC of SMZ. The acute EC 50 was in the range 131 - 270 mg l- 1 for all the compounds tested with the exception of sulfaguanidine (EC 50 = 3. 86 mg l- 1). In acute binary tests SMZ showed a complex interaction with sulfaquinoxaline (superadditivity, additivity or subadditivity) at the three different combination ratios tested, simple additivity to TMP and less than additive interaction when paired to the other SAs. LOEC and NOEC of SMZ obtained from reproduction tests were 3. 125 and 1. 563 mg l- 1 respectively. In conclusion, SMZ should not harm the crustacean population at environmentally realistic concentrations. Its toxicity is comparable to that of other systemic SAs, and their binary interactions are less than additive.

To conduct the study, we employ the data monitored DO and BOD during the period from July 2009 to June 2010, which were inserted in the AcquaNet for calibration and validation. The simulations were performed for the current situation, (calibrated) with two scenarios increase of 10 thousand and 20 thousand inhabitants in the area of influence.
