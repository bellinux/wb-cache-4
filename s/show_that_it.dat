5|$|According to Pentecostal biblical interpretation, the Gospel of John 20:22 {{shows that}} the disciples of Jesus were already born again before the Holy Spirit fell at Pentecost. They then cite biblical {{examples}} in the Book of Acts 2, 8, 10, and 19 to <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was common in the New Testament for Spirit baptism to occur after conversion. In following the biblical pattern, they argue, Christians today should also pray for this baptism which results in greater power for ministry and witness.|$|E
5|$|Although most printed sources, Harvey (1903), Olszewski (1971), Torres (1984), and the Historic Structure Report (2004), {{refer to}} the {{original}} 1884 inscriptions, the National Geodetic Survey (2015) refers to both the 1884 and 1934 inscriptions. All sources print them {{according to their own}} editorial rules, resulting in excessive capitalization (Harvey, Olszewski, and NGS) and inappropriate line breaks. No printed source uses cursive writing, although pictures of the apex clearly <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was used for both the 1884 and 1934 inscriptions.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{morphological}} features, the Alexandrine parakeet (Psittacula eupatria) {{has been}} proposed as the founder population for all Psittacula species on Indian Ocean islands, with new populations settling during the species' southwards colonisation from its native South Asia. Features of that species gradually disappear in species further away from its range. Subfossil remains of Newton's parakeet <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> differed from other Mascarene Psittacula species in some osteological features, but also had similarities, such as a reduced sternum, which suggests a close relationship. Skeletal features indicate an especially {{close relationship with the}} Alexandrine parakeet and the rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri), but the many derived features of Newton's parakeet indicates it had long been isolated on Rodrigues.|$|E

Furthermore, a recent extensive study by Kero et al.

5|$|During the 19th Dynasty, prince Khaemwaset, {{a son of}} Ramesses II, {{undertook}} restoration works throughout Egypt on pyramids and temples {{which had}} fallen into ruin. Inscriptions on the stone cladding of the pyramid of Sahure <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was restored at this time. This is possibly because, from the mid 18th Dynasty onwards, the mortuary temple of Sahure served as a sanctuary for the goddess Sekhmet. In {{the second part of}} the 18th Dynasty and during the 19th Dynasty numerous visitors left inscriptions, stelae and statues in the temple. Activities seemed to have continued on-site for a long time, as shown by graffiti dating from the 26th Dynasty (664525 BC) until the Ptolemaic period (33230 BC).|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} epoch, the Chinese lost their secret to the Koreans, the Japanese, and, later, the Indians, as these {{cultures}} discovered {{how to make}} silk. Allusions to the fabric in the Old Testament <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was known in western Asia in biblical times. Scholars believe that starting in the 2nd century BCE the Chinese established a commercial network aimed at exporting silk to the West. Silk was used, for example, by the Persian court and its king, Darius III, when Alexander the Great conquered the empire. Even though silk spread rapidly across Eurasia, {{with the possible exception}} of Japan its production remained exclusively Chinese for three millennia.|$|E
5|$|Even if a {{differentiating}} {{measure is}} found, {{there is a}} strong presumption that it is constitutional. The legislature must necessarily have a wide power of classification in making laws that operate differently for different groups of people in order to give effect to its policy. Unless the law is plainly arbitrary, suggesting examples of arbitrariness are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this presumption of constitutionality. It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people, and is experienced in making laws directed at societal problems, hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds. Therefore, to rebut this presumption it is necessary for the person challenging the law to adduce some material or factual evidence to <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily.|$|E

The programme used chemical analysis of the paint to <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> contained bakelite and thus confirmed that the painting was a 20th-century fake.|$|E
5|$|Northumbria's {{southern}} frontier with Mercia {{ran across}} England, from the Humber in the east, following the River Ouse and the River Don, to the Mersey in the west. Some archaeological evidence, the Roman Rig dyke, near modern Sheffield, appears to <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a defended border, with large earthworks {{set back from}} the frontier. The Nico Ditch, {{to the south of}} modern Manchester, has been cited in this context, though it has also been argued that it was simply a boundary marker without fortifications. In the far north, the evidence is less clear, and it appears that authority lay with sub-kings, perhaps including native British rulers. The family of Ecgfrith's general Berht may have been one such dynasty of under-kings.|$|E
5|$|The flocculus {{sends out}} neural signals that produce small, {{automatic}} {{movements in the}} eye muscles. These keep the image on an animal's retina steady. Pterosaurs may have had such a large flocculus because of their large wing size, which would mean {{that there was a}} great deal more sensory information to process. The low relative mass of the flocculi in birds is also a result of birds having a much larger brain overall; though this has been considered an indication that pterosaurs lived in a structurally simpler environment or had less complex behaviour compared to birds, and recent studies of crocodilians and other reptiles <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is common for sauropsids to achieve high intelligence levels with small brains.|$|E

5|$|The more neutron-rich {{darmstadtium}} isotopes are {{the most}} stable and are thus more promising for chemical studies; however, they can only be produced indirectly from the alpha decay of heavier elements, and indirect synthesis methods are not favourable for chemical studies. The more neutron-rich isotopes 276Ds and 277Ds might be produced directly in the reaction between thorium-232 and calcium-48, but the yield {{is expected to be}} low. Furthermore, this reaction has already been tested without success, and more recent experiments that have successfully synthesized 277Ds using indirect methods <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has a short half-life of 5.7ms, not long enough to perform chemical studies.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationships}} of the flamecrest or Taiwan firecrest (Regulus goodfellowi) of Taiwan {{have also been}} a source of much debate. It is sometimes viewed as a race of firecrest, but its territorial song resembles those of the Himalayan races of goldcrest, and genetic data <b>show</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is the closest relative of that species, and, despite its alternative name, only distantly related to the firecrest. The flamecrest diverged from the goldcrest 3.0–3.1mya (million years ago).|$|E
