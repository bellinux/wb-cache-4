Reconstitution of an intact immune system is crucial after transplantation to avoid infectious complications, and above all, the establishment of T cell receptor (TCR) diversity is the most important goal in the procedure. Until recently, little has been known of the mechanism of T cell reconstitution in the very early period after HSCT. In this study, we analysed TCR repertoires sequentially in four patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) before and after HSCT. In all patients, the TCR repertoires were extremely abnormal before HSCT, whereas after transplantation there was progressive improvement in TCR diversity, based on analysis of the TCR Vβ repertoire and CDR 3 size distributions.

Amphibian assemblages seem {{to be affected by}} contemporary climate and dispersal-based processes. However, historical processes involved in present patterns of beta diversity remain poorly understood. We assess and disentangle geomorphological, climatic and spatial drivers of amphibian beta diversity in coastal lowlands of the Atlantic Forest, southeastern Brazil. We tested the hypothesis that geomorphological factors are more important in structuring anuran beta diversity than climatic and spatial factors. We obtained species composition via field survey (N = 766 individuals), museum specimens (N = 9, 730) and literature records (N = 4, 763). Sampling area was divided in four spatially explicit geomorphological units, representing historical predictors. Climatic descriptors were represented by the first two axis of a Principal Component Analysis. Spatial predictors in different spatial scales were described by Moran Eigenvector Maps. Redundancy Analysis was implemented to partition the explained variation of species composition by geomorphological, climatic and spatial predictors. Moreover, spatial autocorrelation analyses were used to test neutral theory predictions. Beta diversity was spatially structured in broader scales. <b>Shared</b> <b>fraction</b> between climatic and geomorphological variables was an important predictor of species composition (13 %), as well as broad scale spatial predictors (13 %). However, geomorphological variables alone were the most important predictor of beta diversity (42 %).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{characterize}} Pixirad (INFN spin-off) detector system, an innovative X-ray imaging sensor with intrinsic digital characteristics, based on Chromatic Photon Counting technology. The system counts individually the incident X-ray photons and selects them according to their energy to produce two color images per exposure. The energy selection occurs in real time and at radiographic imaging speed (GHz global counting rate). Photon counting, color mode and a very fine spatial resolution allow to obtain a high ratio between image quality and absorbed dose. The individual building block of the imaging system is a two-side buttable semiconductor radiation detector made of a thin pixellated CdTe crystal coupled to a Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) CMOS pixel ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuits). The first chapter is devoted to introduce the basic processes of interaction of photons with matter. In the second chapter the most common radiographic metrics are described with {{an introduction to the}} imager systems. The third chapter focuses on the pixel detectors, describing the physical mechanism of charge collection involved in the CdTe sensor and explaining the principal components of the front-end electronic chain. In the fourth chapter the general features of Pixirad detector system are described. The chapter five is focused on the characterization of the Pixirad- 1 detector system from the spectroscopic point of view: an energy calibration and resolution has been carried out using different X-ray sources and the charge <b>sharing</b> <b>fraction</b> has been evaluated by exploiting the monochromatic Elettra synchrotron beam.
