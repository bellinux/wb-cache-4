500|$|Indestructible did, however, receive criticism. IGN writer Jim Kaz {{proposes that}} vocalist David Draiman has an [...] "overly-forced" [...] vocal delivery. Kaz also finds, [...] "The tunes are largely similar {{in style and}} {{structure}} ... In essence, there's very little that stands out." [...] He {{goes on to say}} that the album already seems obsolete, [...] "There's just too much of the very recent past on Indestructible to move away from it. So in effect, it <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> dated ... already." [...] It is also suggested that, although possessing a reliably solid foundation, the album lacks a meaning behind its drive: [...] "They wind up sounding a little lost on Indestructible, stabbing their weapons without any reasons behind each parry," [...] says PopMatters writer Andrew Blackie.|$|E
500|$|In July 2012, Pusha T told MTV {{that while}} he was putting {{together}} his solo album, he was heavily influenced by Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino's 1997 film The Devil's Advocate. [...] "This album was based off the movie 'Devil's Advocate'. Not theme-wise at all, but just in the feel of the album. 'Devil's Advocate' is a very dark movie, but at the same time, visually, it's beautiful. The album is based off of that because I speak about the harsh realities of street life but there's a lot of glitz and glamour that comes along with that. If you just look at it at face value, you might think, 'It <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> like he's glorifying ', but when you get tuned into the record, you realize that you get both sides of it." ...|$|E
500|$|AllMusic {{called the}} song a [...] "mid-tempo, strummy folk tune {{with a real}} catch-on falsetto melody," [...] giving its 7" [...] single a four-star review, {{summarizing}} that the release [...] "could be a lost single from a brilliant, obscure '60s psych-folk band while still sounding far ahead of its time." [...] Rolling Stone ranked it the [...] "most affecting" [...] song from Oh, Inverted World, describing it as [...] "a shuffling folk ballad with a spaghetti-western feel and a somber melody that could have come off an Elliott Smith album." [...] Pitchfork Media panned the song, deeming it an imitation of Simon & Garfunkel. The New York Times also covered the song, noting that [...] "It has an odd, slightly serpentine vocal melody (it <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> like an adapted madrigal), and the lyrics are absurd and somehow touching." ...|$|E

500|$|The Village Voice {{felt that}} the song was [...] "unusually accomplished, fresh, and emotional." [...] Paste Magazine praised the song, saying that it [...] "reveals the hand [...] playing: a piano riff as memorable {{as the one in}} 'Clocks,' ringing guitars, martial drums, orchestral pomp and, in the center, Chris Martin's keening vocal, so {{vulnerable}} and yet forceful enough to stand out from the mass of sonic detail." [...] The New York Times, contrariwise, dinged X for [...] "trying to carry beauty of 'Clocks' across an entire album – not least in its first single, 'Speed of Sound,' which isn't the only song on the album to borrow the 'Clocks' drumbeat." [...] Rolling Stone magazine gave a mixed review, calling it [...] "an appealing but not thrilling song" [...] and noted [...] "...it <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> like..."Clocks" [...] but without the swagger." ...|$|E
500|$|Reception of Super Columbine Massacre {{has been}} {{extremely}} negative amongst the mainstream media and those personally affected by the shootings. Upon revealing Columbine's identity as Ledonne, Kovacs said [...] "One of the girls who died [...] {{was a friend of}} mine, Rachel. We were in the same church group. Anyone playing this game can kill Rachel over and over again." [...] The father of one victim remarked to the press that the game [...] "disgusts me. You trivialize the actions of two murderers and the lives of the innocent." [...] One victim of the shooting played the game and voiced reserved support, remarking that [...] "It probably <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> odd for someone like me to say, but I appreciate the fact at least to some degree that something like this was made." [...] While he took issue with what he saw as glamorization of the shooters, he also believed it would help open a dialogue about the shooting.|$|E
500|$|Two {{versions}} of the song are present on the album; the English-language version features vocals from English rapper Dizzee Rascal (who also wrote the lyrics of his parts), while the Spanish-language version features El Cata. Speaking about the collaboration, Dizzee Rascal said that [...] "I know it <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> mad now, but you'll see it and see what's going on". He further said [...] "It's me doing something different man, on a merengue tip." [...] In an interview with Billboard, Dizzee Rascal said about Shakira that, [...] "she's {{a bit of a}} trendsetter -- she does loads of different things on a major scale" [...] and added [...] "You'd expect her to use an American rapper , but she chose me. It meant a lot." [...] He then commented about the song that, [...] "I'd like to be in that Spanish market. I got into the whole reggaeton thing when it came out, so I always wanted to get around to something like that". [...] "Loca" [...] served as the lead single from Sale el Sol. The Spanish version of the song, featuring El Cata, was released on 10 September 2010. The English version, featuring Dizzee Rascal, debuted later on 13 September 2010.|$|E

500|$|In {{spite of}} noting that Diplo makes Madonna sound fun on the song, Gavin Haynes of NME {{commented that the}} song's {{composition}} [...] "showed the gulf between [...] life and her music is now impossible to ignore". Calling it [...] "awry", Alexis Petridis of The Guardian claimed that [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna" [...] is [...] "a fantastic title {{in search of a}} song. In lieu of one, producer Diplo comes up with a kind of hybrid of EDM and happy hardcore and throws Nicki Minaj at her most hyperactive into the mix; the result genuinely sets your teeth on edge." [...] Criticizing Rebel Heart for being [...] "overworked", Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine found that [...] "the duality of its title [...] muddled by the inclusion of garish party jams like the infuriatingly catchy but lyrically cringe-inducing 'Bitch I'm Madonna'". John Murphy of musicOMH remarked that the song [...] "never quite lives up to its fantastic title, and just <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a mess, trying to cram in Diplo-produced dance-hall rhythms, a dubstep breakdown and the seemingly now obligatory Nicki Minaj guest rap". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters opined that the song—and another Rebel Heart track, [...] "Illuminati"—"absolutely reek of desperation, wanting so badly to shock and offend listeners that they fail to resolve as satisfying songs first and foremost".|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} music critics. Joey Lynch of Billboard compared the song's demo {{to the studio}} versions, claiming that [...] "The studio version of 'Joan of Arc' is a massive improvement on the illegally leaked demo that preceded news of the album itself. [...] Nowhere is this more apparent than on 'Joan of Arc,' a solid album track that sounds 10 times better than the leaked version." [...] While reviewing the three tracks released prior to the album, Sam C. Mac of Slant Magazine called it [...] "arguably the standout of the whole over-blown affair," [...] noting that the song [...] "sounded like a highlight even in its more acoustic demo form, but the album version is a full-on stunner... The song <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> like a Cardigans leftover circa 'Long Gone Before Daylight'. It's the strongest (anti-)ballad of Madonna's last few albums, and a strong argument for artists responding to the denigration of their art through the more considered medium of the art itself, rather than snap public statements. [...] More {{than any of the}} previously released songs, 'Joan of Arc' also establishes one of the foundational themes of Rebel Heart, albeit one not always evident when wading through the poorly sequenced album." [...] Adding to the previous review, Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club praised the juxtapositions in the album's lyrical content, which according to her, [...] "make some of her most vulnerable, engaging work in years— in particular 'Joan of Arc'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Connolly credits one of John Bradshaw's {{publications}} {{with helping}} him {{deal with his}} past demons. [...] "He reckons that if this trauma happened {{to you when you}} were five or six then, emotionally, that part of you remains five or six. And {{what you have to do}} is carry that five- or six-year-old around with you and try and emotionally help that other part of you. It <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> airy-fairy, but I think he's something of a genius, Mr. Bradshaw." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{more recent}} years, Mark Deming of the Allmusic website has {{described}} the album's contents as a [...] "well-crafted set" [...] and compared it to Byrdmaniax by stating [...] "It's certainly a significant improvement, but something short of a triumphant return; the band <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> tired in spots, {{as if they were}} starting to run out of gas." [...] In his 2000 review for The Austin Chronicle, Raoul Hernandez gave the album a rating of three and a half stars out of five, commenting [...] "its authentic Dylan and the Band feel solidifies its status as further blueprint of today's roots-rock revival." [...] Rolling Stone senior editor David Fricke described the album favorably in 2000 as [...] "a warm, fine record: a rustic, intimate surprise still rarely appreciated for its quiet nobility and winning performances." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Times David Chater commented {{positively}} on {{the episode}} [...] "Elliot's Wonderful Life", writing that: [...] "Holby City fans will love this episode [...] It is highly effective {{in what it}} sets out to do, although – like so much television at Christmas – you need to drink a pint of warm Baileys for the full effect." [...] The episode was selected as recommended viewing by several TV critics, including Dydd Iau of the Liverpool Daily Post, and Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury, who noted: [...] "It <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> strange, but there's snow, carols and an uplifting happy ending for a change." [...] The Mirror Maeve Quigley called it [...] "a timeless story", though questioned the plausibility of {{a world in which}} Elliot's patients went untreated, as [...] "the NHS isn't a one- man band after all". In contrast, Robert Hanks of The Independent reviewed the episode negatively, calling it [...] "incompetent to the point of sacrilege". Hanks wrote: [...] "What it did add to the mix, that James Stewart never achieved, was to give the viewer an authentic frisson of empathy: there was a point towards the end - during an encounter with Elliot's miraculously resurrected, motor-neurone-disease-afflicted yet remarkably soignée and articulate wife - when I began to see never having been born as preferable, sometimes, to prime-time TV." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot {{noted that}} [...] "Legend sings with more grit than usual, and the Roots crackle with energy", but stated, [...] "This well-intentioned {{collection}} never surpasses the strong originals {{from which it}} draws". Mikael Wood of Spin considered that [...] "The results don't always play to 's melodic strengths; ?uestlove <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> reined-in, too." [...] AllMusic writer Andy Kellman shared a similar sentiment and commented that [...] "There are several instances when the Roots, who are deeply intimate with grit, outshine Legend, whose polished and pride-rich voice occasionally clashes with the material." [...] Chicago Sun-Times writer Thomas Conner gave it two out of four stars and stated: [...] "Legend might be the weak link; he's not the grittiest singer to be tackling this particular set list – he's often a boy in a man's studio here, especially when he gamely but lamely yeah's through the 12-minute arc of Bill Withers' wartime lament 'I Can't Write Left-Handed' – but his ease mostly makes a dynamic foil for the Roots' muscle and the frequent guest vocals." [...] Zach Cole of URBs criticized Legend's singing as overdone and wrote that the album [...] "run the risk of coming across as entirely cheesy and contrived". Slant Magazine's Jesse Cataldo found it musically [...] "hollow and brittle" [...] and commented that [...] "Many of these treatments are good, but barely justify {{what amounts to a}} good-time vanity project for both acts." ...|$|E
2500|$|Flanders {{returned}} to the family home in Hampstead Garden Suburb. He directed and produced plays with a local amateur theatre group and arranged small musical gatherings with other amateurs of music, including Gerard Hoffnung and Frank Hauser. A stage acting career being no longer possible, he found work as a radio broadcaster and wrote a few song lyrics. At the same time, Swann began composing music for revues. He recalled in 1974, [...] "We wrote our first song {{in the summer of}} 1948. I'd gone over to Michael's home near Hampstead Heath {{to see if he could}} think of some words for a tune I'd written … 'It all <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> like Gilbert and Sullivan, don't you think? … It must be terribly boring in the D'Oyly Carte Company, having to do everything exactly as it always has been done – Idea!" [...] The resulting trio, [...] "In the D'Oyly Cart" [...] , for three disgruntled Savoyards, was accepted by the producer Laurier Lister for his new show Oranges and Lemons. The revue and the trio were highly successful, and Lister commissioned further work from the pair for his next production, Penny Plain (1951). [...] Among their contributions to the latter were [...] "Prehistoric Complaint", a solo for Max Adrian, [...] "dressed in bits of fur as a sort of mis-fit caveman", and [...] "Surly Girls", with Adrian, Desmond Walter-Ellis and Jimmy Thompson as a trio [...] of appalling St Trinian's schoolgirls.|$|E
