The dynamic characteristics among the population collision process for the vibration process of the seeder were analyzed by tracing the microcosmic motion of each seed. The following conclusions were concluded, including the relationship between population velocity, phase angle as well as coefficient of restitution and the vibration intensity, {{the relationship between the}} center-of-gravity position as well as volume expansion coefficient of the population after collision and the vibration period, the relationship between the center-of-gravity position as well as volume expansion coefficient of the population after collision and the vibration frequency. This provides basis for determining the vibration work parameters of the precise vibration seeder. Based on agricultural machinery design experience and air-suction vibration principles, a new test bench for precise vibration air-suction tray seed metering device was researched by electromechanical integration technology. Performance test was carried out with oilseed rape seeds as the research object. The test results show that when the vibration frequency is 10. 5 Hz, the vibration amplitude is 4 mm, the vacuum negative pressure value is 3 kPa, the rotating velocity of the discharge plate is near 15 r/min, the pass index of the seeder will exceed 96 %, which provides basis for the structural adjustment and work parameter optimization of the seeder...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{identify}} seed treatment methods for eradicating Phoma valerianellae from lamb`s lettuce seeds in organic vegetable production. Using seeds naturally infested with the pathogen, the effect of three physical methods (hot water, aerated steam, electron treatment) and different agents of natural origin (micro-organisms, plant derived products, resistance inducers) was tested on moist filter paper, in seed trays under controlled conditions and in the field. In an initial screening, none of the tested putative resistance inducers prevented infection by P. valerianellae, while two out of seven formulated micro-organism preparations and six out of 16 experimental microbial strains were effective. When selected agents and the three physical seed treatment methods were compared in blotter and <b>seed</b> <b>tray</b> tests, the physical methods were generally the most effective treatments, while the micro-organism treatments were clearly less efficacious. However, in field experiments with the same seed lots and the same treatments, a statistically significant increase in plant stand was not obtained with any of the treatments. Combinations of the three physical treatment methods with selected non-chemical agents did not perform better than the physical treatments alone. The most effective alternative seed treatments identified in the present study, aerated steam, hot water, electron treatment and thyme oil (0. 1 %), can be recommended for eradication of P. valerianellae from lamb`s lettuce seeds in organic farming.

40|$|Urban bird {{communities}} have higher densities but lower diversity compared with wildlands. However, recent {{studies show that}} residential urban yards with native plantings have higher native bird diversity compared with yards with exotic vegetation. Here we tested whether landscape designs also affect bird foraging behavior. We estimated foraging decisions by measuring the giving-up densities (GUD; amount of food resources remaining when the final forager quits foraging on an artificial food patch, i. e seed trays) in residential yards in Phoenix, AZ, USA. We assessed how two yard designs (mesic: lush, exotic vegetation; xeric: drought-tolerant and native vegetation) differed in foraging costs. Further, we developed a statistical model to calculate GUDs for every species visiting the <b>seed</b> <b>tray.</b> Birds foraging in mesic yards depleted seed trays to a lower level (i. e. had lower GUDs) compared to birds foraging in xeric yards. After accounting for bird densities, the lower GUDs in mesic yards appeared largely driven by invasive and synanthropic species. Furthermore, behavioral responses of individual species were affected by yard design. Species visiting trays in both yard designs had lower GUDs in mesic yards. Differences in resource abundance (i. e., alternative resources more abundant and of higher quality in xeric yards) contributed to our results, while predation costs associated with foraging did not. By enhancing the GUD, a common method for assessing {{the costs associated with}} foraging, our statistical model provided insights into how individual species and bird densities influenced the GUD. These differences we found in foraging behavior were indicative of differences in habitat quality, and thus our study lends additional support for native landscapes to help reverse the loss of urban bird diversity...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} patch assessment by northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) in {{an experimental}} arena where {{the distribution of}} resources in patches, preharvest information about these patches, and spacing of patches varied. We found that preharvest information about patch quality and a bimodal distribution of patch rewards allowed birds to selectively exploit patches high in resources. In contrast, uniform distribution of patch qualities and lack of preharvest information caused birds to forage nonselectively among patches. Birds distinguished among patches of different quality when these patches were spaced 1 3 m apart, but failed to react to patch quality differences when patches were 0 or S m apart We also found a strong effect {{of the level of}} patch depletion on foraging decisions: as resources in die arena became scarce, birds increasingly foraged selectively in die most profitable patches. Foraging decisions of bobwhites are biased by die way they experience and memorize a spatially and temporally variable environment. The relative cost of this cognitive bias (i. e., lost opportunity) is nonlinearty related to die mean resource density in die environment and to die difference between this mean density and die resource density in die exploited patch. Cognitive bias should be considered when evaluating patch assessment capabilities of foragers in complex environments.

40|$|Gorse (Ulex europaeus L.) {{has been}} a major weed in New Zealand and other {{temperate}} countries throughout the world for over 100 years. In 1931, Exapion ulicis (Forster) (gorse seed weevil) was introduced to New Zealand in an attempt to control the spread of gorse. However, gorse in much of New Zealand has two reproductive cycles per year and E. ulicis is active only in spring. In 1992, Cydia succedana (gorse pod moth), which has two generations per year, was introduced into New Zealand to improve the biological control of gorse. Moths were collected from McLeans Island, Canterbury, and placed under laboratory conditions for egg and larval development experiments. Lower temperature threshold for egg and larval development of C. succedana was 11. 5 °C, which is similar to other species in the same genus. The limited results obtained indicated that C. succedana has six larval instars, again similar to other insects of the same genus. Cydia succedana larvae damaged up to three gorse pods. Moth phenology was studied at only two of the sites. At these sites, McLeans Island and Hinewai Reserve, the phenology of C. succedana was synchronised with the phenology of gorse, especially for the first flowering. However, there was less synchronicity for the second flowering. Cydia succedana was more active at the warmer site of McLeans Island had a larger population of C. succedana male moths. In addition, C. succedana was active for longer and became active earlier there. Seven field sites were chosen in the South Island of New Zealand, with different altitudes and climatic conditions. Monthly inspections were made of the reproductive stage of the gorse and gorse pods were sampled when ripe. Gorse at Golden Bay sites produced mature seeds throughout the study period. Sites further south had much shorter reproductive seasons with only one gorse reproductive season per year as confirmed by gorse seed collected in <b>seed</b> <b>trays.</b> There was a wide variation in the number of seeds in the <b>seed</b> <b>trays,</b> 0 - 304 seeds/m².

Seed from the <b>seed</b> <b>trays</b> had a viability of 60 % whereas seed from sampled pods had a viability of 80 %. The effectiveness of both seed feeding insects at reducing the amount of viable gorse seed produced varied from site to site, with gorse seed weevil being more effective at the southern sites. At the northern sites the gorse pod moth was more effective. However, the gorse bushes still produced a significant amount of seed at all sites. The results indicate that further gorse seed feeding biological agents could be required to assist in the biological control of gorse, especially in southern regions where C. succedana does not appear to be as successful.

The plant density (90 - 70 plant m- 2) had more effect on the onion size distribution than on the total yield...|$|R

Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) offer a means to mimic natural drainage processes {{to deal with the}} quality and quantity of runoff at the source. Vegetative SUDS such as swales and filter strips are two such systems that can be used to help manage drainage, removing the suspended solids and promoting infiltration of runoff into the soil. This study aimed to investigate whether particular grass species would be more suitable in these surfaces than others both in removing pollutants (e. g. Heavy Metals) and reducing flows. A pot based pollutant retention study was conducted using processed street dust from central Coventry as a simulated pollutant to be applied in different quantities to the grasses. Analysis was then conducted on compost cores, roots and shoots for heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb & Zn). Street dust was shown to be mainly concentrated in the top layer of compost for all the grass species with only the fine material migrating through the profile. None of the heavy metal concentrations in the roots were influenced by the addition of street dust whereas ANOVA analysis indicated that street dust treatments caused significant differences in heavy metal concentrations in shoots. A pattern of accumulation was illustrated by decreases in heavy metal concentrations in the compost which resulted in increased shoot concentrations. Development of root systems on or near the surface of the pots was possibly a reason for increased uptake of heavy metals by some species. Overall Agrostis canina and Poa pratensis showed the greatest accumulations compared to their controls although Agrostis capillaris syn. tenuis and Agrostis stolonifera also showing accumulation potential. Hydraulic trials involving the use of <b>seed</b> <b>trays</b> to mimic vegetative surfaces were subjected to simulated runoff to examine if particular grass species encouraged infiltration. The results showed that throughflow and hence infiltration was related to the distance travelled along the tray. The different species showed no significant difference between each other regarding encouraging infiltration. Overall the Bent species of grass (in particular Agrostis canina) were shown to promote more throughflow. Based on the two trials the ii Bents (in particular Agrostis canina) and Poa pratensis were deemed to be suitable species worthy of further investigation on a larger scale...|$|R
40|$|In a field {{experiment}} three cultivation systems in organic onion production were compared: direct sowing, planting of set-onions and planting of seedlings with {{three to five}} <b>seeds</b> in each <b>tray.</b> The system with set-onions was the most efficient in terms of planting and sowing costs respectively and costs for manual weeding. The production costs of onions grown in the direct sowing system were 50 % {{higher than in the}} set-onion system. Directly sown onions have generally the best storage properties. Therefore this cultivation system may be an option if storability of the onions is important. The system with planted seedlings {{turned out to be the}} most expensive, hence it is only suited for special situations...|$|R

Among the Paiute, every woman carried bundles of long, slender willow which had been scraped white, and coils of willow sapwood that she had gathered and prepared {{during the winter months}} when the leaves were gone (Wheat 1967). Willow branches are used as the warp for twined baskets and the foundation in coiled baskets. Willows are used to weave water jugs, cradles for newborn infants, hats, cooking vessels, serving bowls, <b>trays,</b> <b>seed</b> beaters, and storage baskets. Some tribes use willow roots as a sewing strand. Virtually all California tribes use willow in their baskets. Tribes which use willow, such as Salix exigua...|$|R
