40|$|Abstractâ€”Carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of death in mine fires and explosions. <b>Self-rescuers,</b> which are designed to provide protection against this hazard, are respirators which remove carbon monoxide from the air inhaled by the wearer; they can easily be carried by miners throughout the working shift. This paper considers the physiological requirements governing the design, of self-rescue apparatus, and discusses the data that are available on the composition of mine air after fires and explosions. On the basis of this information, suggestions are made for the performance that should be attained by self-rescue apparatus, including limits for temperature of the inhaled air and for breathing resist-ance, as well as for carbon monoxide concentration. Laboratory tests of currently available <b>self-rescuers</b> are described...|$|R
40|$|At {{the request}} of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) the Bureau of Mines {{evaluated}} the potential hazards of three compressed oxygen self-contained <b>self-rescuers</b> (SCSR's) designed for use in under-ground coal mines. The evaluation followed the lines used in a similar investigation of chemical <b>self-rescuers</b> and involved laboratory experiments as well as field trials designed to simulate a mining environment. They included bullet impact, bonfire, feeder-breaker impact and feed-through, and mining machine runover tests. The work showed that the units were not inherently unsafe but that under certain conditions of extreme abuse they can present a potential ignition or explosion hazard. This, coupled with a survey of reported damage on SCSR's currently deployed in underground mines, which indicated a relatively high frequency of incidents leading to the destruc-tion of the units, led to new recommendations on the deployment of SCSR's. The recommendations formulated by MSHA state that the units should be either properly worn by the miner, stored in heavy containers, or otherwise protected from situations in which they might be accidentally ruptured or destroyed, such as runover by mobile mining equipment...|$|R
50|$|A {{self-contained}} self-rescue device, SCSR, self-contained <b>self-rescuer,</b> or {{air pack}} is a portable oxygen source for providing breathable air when the surrounding atmosphere lacks oxygen or is contaminated with toxic gases, e.g. carbon monoxide. A SCSR {{is usually a}} closed-circuit breathing apparatus with a chemical oxygen generator or a compressed oxygen cylinder and a carbon dioxide absorber. SCSRs are most commonly used in some coal mines, are intended for one person, and usually supply at least one hour of oxygen. SCSRs are intended to facilitate escape from mines after a fire or explosion. They are also used by people working with machinery {{on the surface of}} a mine or pit, in case they become covered by such materials as coal or sand. Usage of SCSRs for other purposes is discouraged.|$|E
40|$|Since the 1920 s, {{the only}} {{respiratory}} protection which coal miners had available during exposure to toxic or irrespirable environments was a filter <b>self-rescuer</b> that catalytically converted carbon monoxide (CO) to carbon dioxide (CO 2). The deficiencies of this <b>self-rescuer,</b> {{which have been}} described elsewhere (37) led to the support by the Bureau of Mines {{of the development of}} a new generation of self-rescuers which utilized potassium superoxide (KO 2) as the air-revitalization chemical. Since KO 2 reacts with exhaled breath and releases oxygen (O 2) while it absorbs CO 2, the new self-rescuers were closed-circuit devices which isolated the miner from contact with toxic or irrespirable atmospheres. A device with a one-h duration developed by Lockheed under contract with the Bureau of Mines (18) utilized 1. 5 Ib of KO 2, weighed 4. 54 Ib and measured 6. 5 by 3. 6 by 7. 7 in. Since the earlier, filter <b>self-rescuer</b> weighed about 2. 5 lb and was worn continuously by the miner, the one-h, KO 2 -based device represented a substantial addition to the equipment that the miner was accustomed to carrying and, therefore, was considered to be too large and too heavy...|$|E
40|$|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health re 2 {{conducted}} a study to investigate the human response issues related to wearing a self-contained <b>self-rescuer</b> (SCSR). The goal was to develop training to educate miners on what they could expect from their units during an escape. Subjects included miners who had experience wearing SCSRs, manu 2, and researchers. Results identified nine key areas of concern: (1) starting the unit, (2) unit heat, (3) induction of coughing, (4) unit taste, (5) difficulty in breathing while wearing the unit, (6) quality of the air supplied, (7) nose clips, (8) goggles, and (9) {{the behavior of the}} breathing bag.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of self-contained <b>self-rescuers</b> the need for training methods has repeatedly been confirmed. When chemical self rescuers are used the process gives off heat and humidity and the flow of air is subject to resistance.

This could cost the wearer his life if he is in a poisonous atmosphere. It is therefore deemed necessary to make the underground worker accustomed to the effects of breathing when using a self rescuer. Following recommendations from the Fight or Flight Seminar, Simtars has embarked on an ACARP funded study to determine the specification of a simulator or simulators that can be used by the coal mining industry. Even though there are training <b>self-rescuers</b> available from manufacturers, a design for a prototype that can be used by mines at a relatively low cost has also been developed.

40|$|IIn December of 2006, TPI {{responded to}} two RFP's from NIOSH seeking {{technical}} proposals {{to design and}} build novel respirators {{for use in the}} mining industry. One RFP sought a dockable, self-contained, <b>self-rescuer</b> (SCSR) to allow for extended respiratory protection during mine escape, and the other was for a hybrid mine escape respirator incorporating both air-purifying, and self-contained types of respirators, also for the purpose of extending the time available for escaping miners to receive respiratory protection. TPI recognized a commonality in the two RFPs and responded to both with designs that could be produced independently, but which shared several fundamental features. In evaluating TPI's responses to the RFPs, NIOSH recognized a benefit in the shared design features and awarded one contract for TPI to pursue both concepts resulting in one conceptual product referred to as the dockable/hybrid SCSR. This SCSR would be configured to allow any suitably equipped breathing device (CO Filter Self Rescuer or another SCSR) to connect (dock) to the base unit and to allow the user to switch between them without 'breaking seal. ' This dockable unit would retain the capacity to accept multiple changes of O 2 supply or filters over an extended period as the useful life of any individual add-on unit is expended. As the project developed it resulted {{in the development of a}} new carbon monoxide (CO) Filtered <b>Self-Rescuer</b> (FSR) to dock to the SCSR and a small electronic sensor, the Breathing Air Monitor (BAM), to alert the user to certain hazards in the local ambient air: Self Contained Self Rescuer (SCSR). The TPI SCSR is a 60 -min compressed O 2 rebreather that protects the user from all adverse breathing conditions. TPI uses Micropore's Lithium Hydroxide (LiOH) catalyst to absorb the retained CO 2. TPI's SCSR is supplied with a docking valve that allows users to change out nearly spent devices with fresh devices without breaking seal or having to hold their breath. Carbon Monoxide Filter <b>Self-Rescuer</b> (CO FSR). TPI also developed, via a supply agreement with 3 M Company, a carbon monoxide (CO) Filtered <b>Self-Rescuer</b> (FSR) that uses a proprietary precious metal catalyst providing 8 hours of protection. TPI's CO FSR can be supplied with a flanged fitting that docks to TPM's SCSR or it can be supplied with a mouthbit for use as a self-contained device for CO protection alone. Breathing Air Monitor (BAM). Finally TPI developed, in cooperation with the Kohler-Bright Star Company, a Breathing Air Monitor (BAM) that would give the user an indication of when it is necessary to use the SCSR because of an oxygen deficient environment and when it safe to use just the CO filter (normal O 2 but high CO) or if is safe to not use either. This warning system will avoid the user expending the breathing device unnecessarily (e. g. the atmosphere is still breathable). The resultant technology is a module containing the sensors, electronics, PC board and alarms that fits on the miner's cap lamp battery, between the body and top cap. By the end of this contract TPI had demonstrated prototypes of all three products. The project did not result in certified devices by the completion of the contract but TPI has negotiated licensing agreements for these three products and they are being prepared for certification submission by the licensee.

40|$|New {{materials}} have {{allowed for a}} reduced size and weight of compressed gas cylinders that store pure oxygen at high pressures, giving manufacturers of closed-circuit self-contained <b>self-rescuers</b> (SCSRs) improved options for meeting the new standard for oxygen consumption requirements set forth in 42 CFR Part 84 Subpart O. These newly designed very high-pressure cylinders - currently Department of Transportation (DOT) -certified for oxygen duty to 3, 000 psi and now available in two sizes - will enable manufacturers to reduce the overall size and weight of future SCSR units by incorporating these cylinders in their designs. Using this new cylinder technology at 3, 000 psi represents a significant advancement, affording greater SCSR design flexibility by allowing manufacturers to choose between cylinders with two length dimensions, using them singularly or in combination, which will enable different capacities and therefore different operational durations for SCSR designs.

40|$|Interviews of 48 miners {{who escaped}} {{underground}} coal mine fires revealed {{that none of}} them had ever, before that incident, worn their self-contained <b>self-rescuer</b> (SCSR) either in training or in a real emergency. Consequently, they were ill-prepared to use this emergency breathing apparatus. One persistent problem stemmed from the fact that miners had no notion of breathing resistance, nor {{of the fact that it}} would get more difficult to breathe the longer they wore their device. As a result, many of those who were interviewed had simply removed their mouthpieces and breathed ambient air. This is obviously behavior that should be trained out of the workforce. Unfortunately, because of high costs and difficult logistics, miner training is unlikely to ever include donning and wearing an apparatus on a regular basis. In order to give workers a better idea of what to expect from their devices, therefore, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health researchers developed a tabletop (paper and pencil) simulation based upon actual predicaments evacuees had reported encountering. The simulation is designed to emphasize important points related to donning and wearing a self-contained <b>self-rescuer</b> in a mine fire escape, and, by doing so, to bring miners' expectations more in line with what their actual experiences would be. The simulation was field tested in six training classes at three different mining operations. In all, 99 individuals were involved in completing the exercise and rating its properties. In their ratings 88 % of the respondents indicated they thought the scenario could definitely happen in real life, and over 80 % agreed they had learned something new. From the field test data it was concluded that the simulation had authenticity and potential value as a teaching tool. The simulation was therefore used in a pre-test/post-test control group experiment to determine whether it led to improvements in miners' scores on a true-false test of their SCSR's functional capabilities and proper usage.

Although the three compressed-oxygen units are not as sturdy as the chemical oxygen self-rescuers tested previously, they performed reliably after treatments on treadmill tests with human subjects and on machine tests using a breathing and metabolic simulator.

Is there more effective technology to protect miners than the SCSRs currently available? If so, please describe. Two of the most prevalent technologies in use today for SCSRs are that of either chemical reactions or molecular sieves. A molecular sieve is essentially a re-breather that separates unwanted constituents of air and allows oxygen to pass through. Usually, this is a passive operation device that does not actively cycle air to isolate the oxygen.

40|$|Since 198 1, Federal {{mining law}} has {{required}} every miner working in underground coal mines {{to have a}} self-contained, <b>self-rescuer</b> (SCSR) available for use in emergencies. Some miners that have escaped from fires using SCSR's have {{reported that they had}} to remove their mouthpiece to talk during escape, thus compromising the protection afforded by the SCSR. If miners are in thick smoke during an escape, they may have trouble if they become separated from their group. The visibility can be so poor that separation can occur at very short distances. To address this problem, two-way, FM radios were built into the SCSR to improve the ability to communicate should the miners be separated over relatively short distances. The SCSR prototypes built and used in testing included both two-way radios and improved mouthpieces. Comparison studies were conducted using combinations of the new and old mouthpieces, and trials using the radio or not using the radio. Subjective judgments indicate that communication ability was significantly improved using the prototype devices. Communication problems have been encountered with teams using standard voice- powered communications systems. Mine rescue teams perform rescue and recovery work under extremely hazardous conditions, life lines are a standard part of mine rescue team equipment. Leaky feeder and quasi-leaky feeder life line communications systems provide significant improvements over standard systems. These improved systems allow all members of the team {{to communicate with each other}} and their base of operations.

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{subjected}} the CSE SR-lOO self-contained <b>self-rescuer</b> (SCSR) {{approved by}} the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) {{to a series of}} laboratory treatments designed to simulate various environmental conditions in underground coal mines. The tests were designed to predict the ability of the self-rescuers to withstand those environmental stresses without causing a decrease in wearer protection. The apparatus were heated to 710 C for 48 h, cooled to - 450 C for 16 h, vibrated for 9 h, and dropped 1 m on each axis. A critical concern was internal damage to an apparatus, without any obvious external signs, that would cause it to malfunction or seriously degrade its performance. Carbon dioxide (C 02) levels in apparatus with combined treatments were higher than in apparatus with individual treatments and untreated apparatus. The higher levels remained within safe limits, however. None of the treatments caused venting of the small oxygen cylinder that provides starter oxygen. Some bottles were found to be empty because of manufacturing defects in the burst disks. This problem was corrected in later models. The heat treatments did make the case ends more difficult to remove and the breathing bag sticky and subsequently more difficult to unfold. An apparatus that was dropped and vibrated had a broken desiccant bag that released some of its contents which compromised the seal of the relief valve. The case was dented from the drops. As with the first-generation self-rescuers, if there is visible damage to the case of the apparatus, the apparatus should be considered to be internally damaged and must be removed from service...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) investigation assessing {{the prevalence of}} a lack of sufficient start-up oxygen in CSE SR- 100 self-contained <b>self-rescuer</b> (SCSR) devices. The availability of sufficient start-up oxygen is critical to the performance of the SR- 100. As part of a routine field testing program of SCSRs used in coal mines, NIOSH and MSHA detected two SR- 100 s that lacked sufficient start-up oxygen. CSE Corporation subsequently discovered one SCSR that lacked sufficient start-up oxygen in that company's internal quality control program and voluntarily stopped further production and sales of SR- 100 s. NIOSH developed a protocol to test for the presence of start-up oxygen in field-deployed SR 100 s. The purpose of the test was to determine if the failure rate of the start-up oxygen in the population of 70, 000 field-deployed units exceeded 1 %. NIOSH and MSHA used American Society for Quality (ASQ), Sampling Procedures and Tables for Inspection of Isolated Lots by Attributes (ASQC Q 3 - 1988). In assessing the SR- 100 s, if no more than 3 failures of start-up oxygen occurred in the 500 -unit random sample, the SR- 100 could be accepted as meeting the Limiting Quality (LQ) rate of 1. 25 % for start-up oxygen performance. NIOSH tested five hundred field-deployed devices collected from coal mines throughout the United States. NIOSH observed 5 start-up oxygen failures in the 500 units it tested. The maximum number of failures allowed under the LQ rate of 1. 25 % was exceeded; therefore, the 1 % maximum allowable failure rate under the protocol was not met.

40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) National Personal Protec-tive Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) {{conduct a}} Long Term Field Evaluation (LTFE) program to {{evaluate}} deployed self-contained <b>self-rescuers</b> (SCSRs). The {{objective of the}} program is to evaluate how well SCSRs endure the under-ground coal mining environment with regard to both physical damage and aging when they are deployed in accordance with Federal regulations (30 CFR 75. 1714). This report presents ?ndings of the combined eighth and ninth phases of the LTFE. For these phases, over four hundred SCSRs were evaluated. The units tested include the CSE SR- 100, Draeger Oxy K-Plus, MSA Life-saver 60, and the OCENCO EBA 6. 5. The OCENCO M- 20 was evaluated only in Phase 9. Testing was per-formed between December 2000 and April 2004. Results of the evaluation indicate that all SCSRs experience some performance degradation due to the mining environment. Observed degrada-tion varies from elevated levels of carbon dioxide, high breathing resistance, and reduced capacity. Mechanical degradation to the SCSR components included breathing hoses, chemical beds, outer cases and seals. The LTFE tests discussed in this report are different from tests performed for SCSR certi?cation to the requirements of 42 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 84 (42 CFR, Part 84). LTFE tests reported here are conducted to an end point, oxygen depletion, to enable comparison of the duration of new and deployed SCSRs. The method for obtaining deployed SCSRs for this evalua-tion was not a random selection from the deployed population of SCSRs. Although the results of these tests are useful for observing performance of the tested SCSRs, they are not representative of all deployed SCSRs. A new evaluation protocol, with revised sampling strategies, test methods, and reporting procedures, is currently being designed to enhance the generalizability of the results. This program will be implemented following completion of Phase 10 of the current LTFE protocol...|$|R
40|$|Instructor's {{guide to}} {{accompany}} a 25 minute training video. "Objective: Researchers with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) {{have developed a}} training module to educate both new, inexperienced miners as well as veterans on important issues related to self-rescue and escape procedures. These include: (1) physical and environmental conditions that can be encountered in a mine after a major explosion, (2) knowledge of emergency meeting locations and escape routes, (3) the importance of using <b>self-rescuers,</b> even in seemingly clear air, to keep the lungs isolated from contaminants, and (4) why miners should not go off to look for others who are missing. In addition, the module may stimulate miners to think about and discuss mine explosions and the devastating effects of such an event. Background: On November 20, 1968, a massive explosion rocked the underground workings of Mountaineer Coal Co. 's Farmington No. 9 Mine in West Virginia. Of the 99 miners who were working in the mine {{at the time of}} the explosion, only 21 survived and escaped the mine. This group included eight miners who were rescued from the Mahan's Run air shaft. Nearly 40 years after the event, researchers from the NIOSH Pittsburgh Research Laboratory conducted oral history interviews with two of the eight survivors rescued from the shaft. During their interviews, Waitman "Bud" Hillberry and Gary Martin discuss the Farmington Mine disaster, including the workplace climate leading up to the explosion, and give detailed accounts of their escape from the mine's 7 South section and rescue from the Mahan's Run air shaft after the explosion. During their discussions, Hillberry and Martin describe: (1) Events and conditions leading up to the explosion, such as ventilation stoppings lagging far behind the faces of 7 South section. (2) The explosion event and their initial response to it. (3) The devastation caused by the initial explosion. (4) The possible problems that could occur by going back to look for missing miners. (5) Problems that can occur when miners remove their <b>self-rescuers,</b> even in seemingly clear air. (6) Knowing how to properly use self-rescue equipment. (7) Starting the fans prematurely. (8) Decisions and actions that played a role in the explosion and subsequent rescue efforts. Until 2006, training to prepare miners to escape an underground mine explosion was largely informal and not detailed. At most, trainers reviewed emergency escape procedures and discussed emergency response. In addition, miners may have walked the escapeways from their respective work stations. In 2006, several fatal incidents occurred at U. S. underground coal mines. These included an explosion at the Wolf Run Mining Co. 's Sago Mine in West Virginia, in which 12 miners perished; a mine fire at the Aracoma Coal Co. 's Alma No. 1 Mine in West Virginia, in which 2 miners died; and an explosion at the Kentucky Darby Coal Co. 's Darby No. 1 Mine, in which 5 miners died. These incidents raised a number of issues related to mine escape and self-rescue following catastrophic events. As a result, new regulations were promulgated requiring mines to provide quarterly mine escape and evacuation training to their workforces. Approach: NIOSH researchers first learned of Hillberry and Martin in 2002. Both men were contacted and agreed to individual videotaped interviews. Hillberry worked as a brattice man at the mine and was in the 7 South section building ventilation stoppings. Segments of his interview provided important information that set the stage for the interview with Martin. On the night of the explosion, although a mechanic, Martin was running a shuttle car on 7 South section. He gave a vivid, detailed account of the event from the time the explosive forces came into the working section until he and the seven other crew members with him were rescued via the Mahan's Run air shaft. Martin also dramatically described underground conditions and the devastation he observed after the initial explosion. The videotapes of both interviews were reviewed and edited by NIOSH researchers for content. Careful attention was paid to ensure that valuable information with explicit teaching points was presented within a reasonable timeframe. Results and Accomplishments: A 25 -minute videotape and instructor's guide for use in safety training or other settings were developed. The target audience consists of all underground mine workers, regardless of commodity. This training video will help safety instructors better prepare both new, inexperienced miners as well as veterans for the situations they could encounter should they have to escape an underground mine following an explosion. This "expectations" training will help miners to better respond should an explosion occur. The training module will also provide a powerful reminder to all miners that it is critical to make safety an everyday practice. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 NIOSHTIC no. 2003588...|$|R
