50|$|Prior to {{the late}} 20th century, the tie <b>stall</b> or <b>standing</b> <b>stall</b> was a more common housing for working horses that were taken out daily. Taking only {{half the size of}} a box stall, more animals could be housed in a single barn or stable. Generally about 5 by 10 ft or {{sometimes}} smaller, with a manger in the front, usually to which the animal was tied, the design allowed the horse to lie down if the lead rope was long enough, but not to turn around.|$|R

40|$|The {{socio-economic}} {{structure of}} the breeding farms of Franches-Montagnes horses (FM) in Switzerland is evaluated {{on the basis of}} an investigation carried out in 2002 by the Swiss FM breeding federation. Questionnaires were sent to 3500 of its members and the results include data from 968 breeding enterprises, housing a total of 3965 FM. The quality of the husbandry of FM varies according to factors such as the altitude and the geographical situation of the farms and studs. Socio-economic parameters, such as the role of FM in the business, their use (breeding, driving, riding) and the age and level of professional education of the owners may also have an effect on standards of husbandry. The results show that the owners for whom FM represent a source of income more frequently keep their horses in <b>standing</b> <b>stalls,</b> but give them more time to exercise at liberty than the horses belonging to amateur breeders. Younger and better educated breeders are more likely to house their animals in groups...|$|R

When James Whittall, Jr. excavated the berm, he found stumps of posts on three sides indicating a Native American lodge built of saplings. Associated with the lodge were two hearths. Nearby is an elongated cairn {{in the shape of}} a boat (narrow at the tips and wide in the middle). On top of this cairn were three <b>short</b> <b>standing</b> stones.

40|$|Lameness in {{dairy cows}} {{continues}} to be a major problem for the industry world-wide. Prevalence appears higher in free stall housed dairy herds than in tie stall herds in Wisconsin, and is especially a problem in free stall herds using mat or mattress stall surfaces compared to those herds using sand. This article describes some of the behavioral differences which contribute to this difference. In particular, lame cows housed in mattress free stall barns appear to spend longer <b>standing</b> in the <b>stall,</b> compared to lame cows in sand stalls. This time spent standing appears to reflect a difficulty in performing the process of lying down and <b>standing</b> up. Future <b>stall</b> design recommendations must be based on providing a stall in which lame cows can maintain normal daily activity patterns...|$|R

Prost had one younger brother called Daniel, who died of cancer in September 1986. Although <b>short,</b> <b>standing</b> at 1.67m (5ft 6 in) Prost was an active, {{athletic}} child, who enthusiastically took part in diverse sports, including wrestling, roller skating and football. In doing so he broke his nose several times. He considered careers as a gym instructor or a professional footballer before he discovered kart racing at the age of 14 while on a family holiday.

40|$|There {{is growing}} demand from the {{industrial}} and research communities for high gradient, compact RF accelerating structures. The commonly used S-band SLAC-type structure has an operating gradient {{of only about}} 20 MV/m; while much higher operating gradients (up to 70 MV/m) have been recently achieved in X-band, {{as a consequence of}} the substantial efforts by the Next Linear Collider (NLC) collaboration to push the performance envelope of RF structures towards higher accelerating gradients. Currently however, high power X-band RF sources are not readily available for industrial applications. Therefore, RadiaBeam Technologies is developing a <b>short,</b> <b>standing</b> wave S-band structure which uses frequency scaled NLC design concepts to achieve up to a 50 MV/m operating gradient at 2856 MHz.
