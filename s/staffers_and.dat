25|$|In 1989, the DTH {{incorporated}} as {{a separate}} educational 501(c)(3) non-profit entity. The paper voluntarily stopped taking student fee money in 1993, making it completely financially independent from the University for the first time. That allowed the DTH to begin its current process of allowing an 11-member committee of <b>staffers</b> <b>and</b> community members to select the next editor. Previously, the position had been filled in campuswide elections. Peter Wallsten was the last DTH editor selected by campuswide elections.|$|E
25|$|After WikiLeaks {{published}} Democratic National Committee emails {{which suggested}} that DNC <b>staffers</b> <b>and</b> partly Wasserman Schultz herself had inappropriately backed Hillary Clinton {{in the primary}} campaigns while criticizing the Bernie Sanders campaign, Wasserman Schultz tendered her resignation {{as the head of}} the DNC, to become effective as of the close of the nominating convention in Philadelphia. According to reports in The Washington Post, Wasserman Schultz strongly resisted suggestions she resign, requiring a phone call from President Barack Obama to finally force her resignation.|$|E
25|$|The {{messages}} were usually {{unrelated to the}} episodes. They were a humorous device that invited the viewer {{to return to the}} quirky, down-on-his-luck world of Jim Rockford. The messages usually had to do with creditors, deadbeat clients, or were just oddball vignettes. Numerous celebrities and well-known contemporary public figures were used in the recordings. Though a distinctive and clever entry device, the messages became difficult for the writers to create. Suggestions from <b>staffers</b> <b>and</b> crew were welcome and often used.|$|E

25|$|Their {{first show}} was a December 11, 1981 Christmas party for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The performers, {{considering}} the show a success, performed the same songs several more times that month. In 1982, the group expanded to include House <b>staffers</b> <b>and</b> Democrats. Despite being predominantly Republican, they tried to make their shows bipartisan with a roughly-even mix of songs lampooning Democrats and Republicans. Although the group attracted media interest at the time, they refused interview requests out of concern that their jobs could be endangered by press coverage and their behavior might affect Strauss and Newport's subcommittee chair Charles H. Percy.|$|E
25|$|One organization, It Gets Better Canada, {{created a}} 12-minute video which {{featured}} {{a number of}} Canadian LGBT public figures, including Deb Pearce, Rick Mercer, Rex Harrington, Ann-Marie MacDonald, Enza Anderson, Diane Flacks, Brad Fraser, Mark Tewksbury, George Smitherman, Peter Fallico, Laurie Lynd and the cast of 1 Girl 5 Gays, talking about their own experiences of coming out in a documentary interview format. In addition to the Trevor Project, this video also endorsed two similar Canadian services, Kids Help Phone and Toronto's Lesbian Gay Bi Trans Youth Line. A similar video was subsequently released {{by a group of}} Canadian Broadcasting Corporation employees, including national network figures such as Jian Ghomeshi, Sook-Yin Lee, W. Brett Wilson and Brent Bambury as well as numerous other <b>staffers</b> <b>and</b> freelancers, speaking about their experiences of bullying on a variety of issues, including sexuality, race and disability. Former politicians Michael Ignatieff and Jack Layton also released videos when they were in office.|$|E

500|$|Paul Wellstone (DFL) {{was elected}} to the United States Senate in 1990, {{defeating}} incumbent Rudy Boschwitz (R) in one of the biggest election upsets of the decade. [...] In 1996, he defeated Boschwitz again in a rematch of the 1990 election. [...] Wellstone was known for being a liberal activist, as evidenced by his books How the Rural Poor Got Power: Narrative of a Grassroots Organizer, describing his work with the group Organization for a Better Rice County, and The Conscience of a Liberal: Reclaiming the Compassionate Agenda. [...] He explored a possible presidential bid in 1998, telling people he represented the [...] "Democratic wing of the Democratic Party". On October 25, 2002, he was killed in a plane crash near Eveleth, Minnesota, along with his wife, his daughter, three campaign <b>staffers,</b> <b>and</b> the two pilots.|$|E
500|$|Hayward is {{credited}} with putting his naval career [...] "on the line" [...] by bringing the baby on the ship, which was against regulations, and he subsequently received orders to get the baby off the ship. However, having a baby on board boosted sailors' morale, and Hayward later said that a leader must [...] "know when to intelligently disregard regulations." [...] A visa was obtained by intervention of Richard Nixon's <b>staffers,</b> <b>and</b> a passport was secured by winning a poker game against the South Korean who issued passports. The baby, adopted by Navy surgeon Hugh Keenan, who was also in port at Inchon, was later named Daniel, and was transferred to a civilian ship in Japan. Daniel Keenan was raised in Seattle and began attending reunions of {{the crew of the}} Point Cruz in 1993. The story of Daniel Keenan was made into a television movie, A Thousand Men and a Baby, which aired on CBS in 1997.|$|E

500|$|The {{commission}} reentered {{the public}} consciousness in 2000 when {{the former chairman of}} the commission, Donald Rumsfeld, was named by newly elected President George W. Bush to be Secretary of Defense, his second time in that office. On December 30, 2000, Richard Garwin, a former commissioner, praised Rumsfeld for his commission work in a New York Times op-ed piece, although he reiterated that the commission never suggested whether or not the US should build a missile defense system. [...] Other <b>staffers</b> <b>and</b> members of the commission were also appointed by the new Bush administration: Paul Wolfowitz was named Deputy Secretary of Defense, William Schneider, Jr. was appointed by Rumsfeld to the Defense Science Board, and in March 2003 Stephen Cambone was selected by Rumsfeld to fill the newly created Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence position. [...] Robert Gates, the man who conducted the first review of the ballistic missile threat, was appointed Secretary of Defense after Rumsfeld's November 2006 resignation.|$|E
500|$|After {{selecting}} the music by Alexandrov for the anthem, Stalin needed new lyrics. [...] He {{thought that the}} anthem was short and, because of the Great Patriotic War, that it needed a statement about the impending defeat of Nazi Germany by the Red Army. The poets Sergey Mikhalkov and Gabriel El-Registan were called to Moscow by one of Stalin's <b>staffers,</b> <b>and</b> were told to fix the lyrics to Alexandrov's music. They were instructed to keep the verses the same, but {{to find a way}} to change the refrains which described [...] "a Country of Soviets". Because of the difficulty of expressing the concepts of the Great Patriotic War in song, that idea was dropped from the version which El-Registan and Mikhalkov completed overnight. After a few minor changes to emphasize the Russian Motherland, Stalin approved the anthem and had it published on 7 November 1943, including a line about Stalin [...] "inspir us to keep the faith with the people". The revised anthem was announced to all of the USSR on January1, 1944 and became official on March15, 1944.|$|E
500|$|The {{speech was}} also a source of {{considerable}} controversy within the Reagan administration itself, with several senior <b>staffers</b> <b>and</b> aides advising against the phrase, saying anything that might cause further East-West tensions or potential embarrassment to Gorbachev, with whom President Reagan had built a good relationship, should be omitted. American officials in West Germany and presidential speechwriters, including Peter Robinson, thought otherwise. Robinson traveled to West Germany to inspect potential speech venues, and gained an overall sense {{that the majority of}} West Berliners opposed the wall. Despite getting little support for suggesting Reagan demand the wall's removal, Robinson kept the phrase in the speech text. On May 18, 1987, President Reagan met with his speechwriters and responded to the speech by saying, [...] "I thought it was a good, solid draft." [...] White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker objected, saying it sounded [...] "extreme" [...] and [...] "unpresidential," [...] and Deputy US National Security Advisor Colin Powell agreed. Nevertheless, Reagan liked the passage, saying, [...] "I think we'll leave it in." ...|$|E
