40|$|Subsea {{pipelines}} {{are likely}} to be exposed to fishing activity, which may results in trawl gear interacting with a pipeline. The interaction is classified into impact, pull-over and a special case called hooking. The trawl load is considered to be an important design load in pipeline design. In the recent developments of the subsea pipelines, the pipe-in-pipe (PIP) system is a solution for high-pressure/high-temperature requirements. Previous research and findings mainly focus on trawl gear interaction with a <b>single</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>wall</b> pipeline. There is limited research on trawl gear-PIP interaction. The main objective of this thesis work is to simulate and investigate the impact and pull-over responses of a pipe-in-pipe system during the interference with an otter trawl board. The numerical study were carried out based on nonlinear finite element (FE) method by means of the computer software SIMLA. Based on the previous models for the <b>single</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>wall</b> <b>pipe,</b> modifications on the models were made to account for PIP. An advanced impact model was enabled to study the impact response of PIP. Later, a detailed clump weight pullover model was modified and studied by using the new contact element (cont 153) in SIMLA. Finally, a detailed trawl board pull-over model (with simplified geometry) was modified with the cont 153 element to study the PIP response under pull-over loads. More details are described as follows. Firstly, a study was carried out to investigate the impact response of a <b>single</b> <b>pipe</b> <b>wall</b> <b>pipe</b> and a PIP system. The impact model was established according to the Recommended Practice DNV-RP-F 111 (RP) by using an advanced impact calculation method. Various pipeline parameters like <b>pipe</b> <b>wall</b> thickness, content density, concrete coating, specified minimum yield strength (SMYS), different trawl gears, and position of centralisers for PIP were considered. The purpose is to check how these parameters influence the impact response. For pull-over analysis, to gain more understanding of the cont 153 element, the clump weight model from Maalø’s work was tested. As a result of this study, a contact stiffness with good contact behaviour was obtained and then used in further study. It is also found that the ii friction coefficient has important influence on the results. The new contact element was then used in a trawl board model with the stiffness defined in the clump weight case. The warp line tension results are compared with previous model test results. The comparisons show that for lower span heights (0. 5 m and 1. 0 m), good agreements were achieved, but noticeable deviations were found for higher span heights (5. 0 m). Finally, the detailed trawl board model was used to investigate the pull-over responses (displacement, bending moment, strain, etc.) of a PIP at low span height (up to 1. 0 m). The pull-over responses from the detailed model were compared with those from RP load. The main finding is that the responses increases as the span height increases, and the responses from the detailed model are in general lower than the RP case. This finding indicates the possibility to further optimise PIP design in the view point of trawl board pull-over loads at low span heights...|$|R

In this paper, the propagation characteristics of circumferential Lamb wave in thick <b>wall</b> <b>pipe</b> and the interaction law with radial cracks were studied. A large number of simulation were carried out by using the commercial finite element software ABAQUS. The propagation characteristics of circumferential Lamb wave in thick <b>wall</b> <b>pipe</b> were analyzed.

Precast {{thin-wall}} {{steel and}} spun concrete composite pile (TSC pile) {{is a kind}} of new type of steel-concrete composite pile whose bearing performance is between steel pile and concrete pile. This article adopted FEM software to set up 3 D TSC pile model to analyze its performance.

Then lots of bending bearing capacity contrast calculations were conducted by using different cross section parameters (outside diameter, concrete <b>pipe’s</b> <b>wall</b> thickness and steel <b>pipe’s</b> <b>wall</b> thickness), and the influences of these parameters on bending resistance of TSC pile were discussed. The results showed that: with the increase of outside diameter, concrete <b>pipe’s</b> <b>wall</b> thickness and steel <b>pipe’s</b> <b>wall</b> thickness, TSC pile’s ultimate flexural bearing capacity increased.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a new coupon sampling device {{that can be}} inserted directly into the pipes within water distribution systems (WDS), maintaining representative near <b>wall</b> <b>pipe</b> flow conditions and enabling simultaneous microscopy and DNA-based analysis of biofilms formed in situ. To evaluate this sampling device, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) analyses were used to investigate changes in biofilms on replicate coupons within a non-sterile pilot-scale WDS. FISH analysis demonstrated increases in bacterial biofilm coverage of the coupon surface over time, while the DGGE analysis showed the development of increasingly complex biofilm communities, with time-specific clustering of these communities. This coupon design offers improvements over existing biofilm sampling devices in that it enables simultaneous quantitative and qualitative compositional characterization of biofilm assemblages formed within a WDS, while importantly maintaining fully representative near <b>wall</b> <b>pipe</b> flow conditions. Hence, it provides a practical approach {{that can be used to}} capture the interactions between biofilm formation and changing abiotic conditions, boundary shear stress, and turbulent driven exchange within WDS.

25|$|Metal liners may be {{stainless}} steel, aluminum, or {{galvanized iron}} {{and may be}} flexible or rigid pipes. Stainless steel is made in several types and thicknesses. Type 304 is used with firewood, wood pellet fuel, and non-condensing oil appliances, types 316 and 321 with coal, and type AL 29-4C is used with non-condensing gas appliances. Stainless steel liners must have a cap and be insulated if they service solid fuel appliances, but following the manufacturer's instructions carefully. Aluminum and galvanized steel chimneys are known as class A and class B chimneys. Class A are either an insulated, double <b>wall</b> stainless steel <b>pipe</b> or triple <b>wall,</b> air-insulated <b>pipe</b> often known by its genericized trade name Metalbestos.
