She told the court that as she opened the boot to Mr Gilroy's car, <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> fresh smell coming from inside. She told the advocate depute that it could either have been an 'air freshener' or a 'cleansing agent'.|$|E
25|$|The {{day of the}} murder, an {{eyewitness}} came forward and told investigators that she allegedly saw {{the two young men}} involved in Bermúdez Zacarías' murder. She said that the two men were of slim complexion and may have been 24–25 years old; according to her description, one was fully dressed in black and that the other had dark pants and a white sweater. The woman saw them as she was driving through the street where Bermúdez Zacarías was murdered. When she first saw the two men, she did not think they were suspicious because she thought they were construction workers from a nearby site. As she was driving down the street, she saw Bermúdez Zacarías on the road and thought that he had fainted. When she got close to the body, <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> pool of blood. She turned back to look at the two men, who kept walking down the street in an opposite direction.|$|E
25|$|However, Charlotte did {{not allow}} herself to be discouraged. Furthermore, {{coincidence}} came to her aid. One day in autumn 1845 while alone {{in the dining room}} <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> small notebook lying open on in the drawer of Emily's portable writing desk and of my sister Emily's handwriting. She read it and was dazzled by the beauty of the poems that she did not know. The discovery of this treasure was what she recalled five years later, and according to Juliet Barker, she erased the excitement that she had felt, more than surprise , a deep conviction that these were not common effusions, nor at all like the poetry women generally write. I thought them condensed and terse, vigorous and genuine. To my ear, they had a peculiar music – wild, melancholy, and elevating. In the following paragraph Charlotte describes her sister's indignant reaction at her having ventured into such an intimate realm with impunity. It took Emily hours to calm down and days to be convinced to publish the poems.|$|E

25|$|On a {{less intense}} scale, other {{relationships}} have been doted upon in the fandom from suggestive hints or explicit statements throughout canon, {{such as those}} between Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson, Harry Potter's parents James Potter and Lily Evans, Rubeus Hagrid and Olympe Maxime, or Percy Weasley and Penelope Clearwater, or Rose Granger-Weasley and Scorpius Malfoy. A potential relationship between Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood was originally dispelled by Rowling, though she later retracted this and said <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> slight attraction between them in Deathly Hallows. Some couples, besides Harry and Ginny and Ron and Hermione, have been explicitly stated in the series: Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour are married in Deathly Hallows after dating throughout Half-Blood Prince. In Half-Blood Prince, Nymphadora Tonks keeps her feelings for Remus Lupin to herself, but remains depressed when he refuses her advances; he feels that his being a werewolf would not create a safe relationship. Tonks professes her love {{for him at the}} end of the book, and she and Lupin have been married by the beginning of Deathly Hallows and have a son 'Teddy' later in the book. Other couples, such as Harry and Draco or Lupin and Sirius Black, are favorites among fans who read fan fiction about them. There is also debate about Lily and Severus vs. James.|$|E
500|$|During the {{struggle}} at Boggart Hole Clough, Richard Pankhurst began to experience severe stomach pains. He {{had developed a}} gastric ulcer, and his health deteriorated in 1897. The family moved briefly to Mobberley, {{with the hope that}} country air would help his condition. He soon felt well again, and the family returned to Manchester in the autumn. In the summer of 1898 he suffered a sudden relapse. Pankhurst had taken their oldest daughter Christabel to Corsier, Switzerland, to visit her old friend Noémie. A telegram arrived from Richard, reading: [...] "I am not well. Please come home, my love." [...] Leaving Christabel with Noémie, Pankhurst returned immediately to England. On 5 July, while on a train from London to Manchester, <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> newspaper announcing the death of Richard Pankhurst.|$|E
500|$|Rowling {{mentioned}} that she originally had a Weasley relative named Malfalda, who, according to Rowling, [...] "was {{the daughter of}} the 'second cousin who's a stockbroker' mentioned in Philosopher's Stone. This stockbroker had been very rude to Mr. and Mrs.Weasley in the past, but now he and his (Muggle) wife had inconveniently produced a witch, they came back to the Weasleys asking for their help in introducing her to wizarding society before she starts at Hogwarts". Malfalda {{was supposed to be a}} Slytherin and who was to fill in the Rita Skeeter subplot, but eventually was removed as [...] "there were obvious limitations to what an eleven year old closeted at school could discover". Rowling considered Rita Skeeter to be [...] "much more flexible". Rowling also admitted that the fourth book was the most difficult to write at the time, because <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> giant plot hole halfway through writing. In particular, Rowling had trouble with the ninth chapter, [...] "The Dark Mark", which she rewrote 13times.|$|E

While she was leaving, <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> woman dressed in 1930s fashion. She followed her and the woman asked Spears to enter the [...] "Mystic Lounge". Spears reappeared wearing a corset to perform [...] "…Baby One More Time" [...] along with [...] "Oops!...I Did It Again" [...] and [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy". All of the three were reworked for the show with elements of jazz and blues. [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] was also performed on the promotional tour made on some House of Blues locations, called The M+M's Tour. The show started with Spears singing a short version of the song {{dressed in a white}} go-go boots, a white miniskirt and a sparkling pink bikini top. On The Circus Starring Britney Spears, the song made into the Electro Circ act. It was the final song of the act, performed after [...] "Toxic". The performance consisted on Spears and her dancers performing a remix of the song. On 2011's Femme Fatale Tour, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] was performed in a medley with the remix of Rihanna's [...] "S" [...] (2010). On Spears' current residency show [...] in Las Vegas, the song was included on its setlist.|$|E
500|$|The show {{began with}} a skit where a {{flamboyant}} master of ceremonies welcomed spectators to the Onyx Hotel. After this, he took an onyx and threw into the video screens, causing a virtual chandelier {{to fall into the}} floor. Spears briefly appeared in the screens, as her dancers descended to the stage. She entered standing on top of a small bus dressed in a black catsuit, where she performed [...] "Toxic". She descended to the stage for the breakdown and then performed [...] "Overprotected". She took a break to talk to the audience, before going into [...] "Boys", which featured the male dancers pushing her while she was standing in luggage carts. [...] "Showdown" [...] featured rainbow-colored lighting effects and was the last song of the first act. A video interlude followed featuring Spears and her friends outside a club. While she was leaving, <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> woman dressed in 1930s fashion. She followed her and the woman asked Spears to enter the [...] "Mystic Lounge". Spears reappeared wearing a frilly pink corset to perform [...] "...Baby One More Time". She performed [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again" [...] with a vintage microphone and joined by her background singers. Spears and her dancers performed [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy", which contained elements of Latin percussion. After this, she talked to the audience and usually referenced her wedding with childhood friend Jason Alexander. She also introduced her band before leaving the stage.|$|E
2500|$|Anna Brun noticed Marie taking {{white powder}} from her {{malachite}} box and stirring {{it into the}} eggnog. When asked, Marie said it was [...] "orange-blossom sugar". But Anna's suspicions were aroused when <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> few white flakes floating {{on the surface of}} the eggnog after the patient took a few sips. She showed the glass to Dr. Massénat; he tasted the eggnog and experienced a burning sensation, but attributed the flakes to some ceiling plaster that may have fallen in the glass. Anna was not convinced; she put the rest of the eggnog in a cupboard and kept a close eye on Marie. She saw Marie stir more white powder into some soup for Charles. Again, Charles felt violently ill after a few sips. Anna took the cup of soup away and mustered enough courage to tell Charles's relatives of her suspicions.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} study interplanetary scintillation, Hewish built the Interplanetary Scintillation Array at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory. The array {{consisted}} of 2,048 dipoles over almost five acres of land, and {{was built to}} constantly survey the sky at a time resolution of about 0.1 seconds. This high time resolution set it apart from many other radio telescopes of the time, as astronomers did not expect emission from an object to feature such rapid variation. Soon after observations were under way, Hewish's student Jocelyn Bell turned this assumption on its head, when <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> signal which was soon recognized as emanating from {{a new class of}} object, the pulsar. Thus [...] "it was an investigation of interplanetary scintillation that led to the discovery of pulsars, even though the discovery was a by-product rather than the purpose of the investigation." ...|$|E

In October 2011, Paulini reunited with Anu and Knight for more shows of their Ladies of Jazz Tour. Paulini's third independent single [...] "Fireman" [...] was released digitally on 10 February 2012. The song was inspired by Paulini's trip to New York, where <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> group of women [...] "screaming with excitement" [...] as a truck full of firemen drove past them. She wanted to write [...] "a cheeky song" [...] that celebrates the work firemen do. A music video, featuring shirtless real-life firefighters, was also shot to accompany the song's release. Paulini embarked on a club tour in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane throughout February and March 2012 to promote [...] "Fireman". She also performed [...] "Fireman" [...] in New York at the 2012 Gay Pride event, Shark.

2500|$|Following their post-sleep period, {{the crews}} {{set to work}} {{preparing}} for the first spacewalk of the mission. Stefanyshyn-Piper and Bowen were suited up and in the airlock ahead of schedule, and the EVA started at 18:09 UTC, with Piper becoming the first female Lead Spacewalker. While Piper was preparing to begin work on the SARJ, <b>she</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> significant amount of grease in her tool bag, [...] "I think we had a grease gun explode in the large bag, because there's grease in the bag," [...] Piper reported to Kimbrough, who was working inside the shuttle to help coordinate the EVA. Mission Control managers instructed Piper {{to clean up the}} grease using a dry wipe, and while she was doing the cleanup, one of the crew lock bags floated away. [...] "I guess one of my crew lock bags was not transferred and it's loose," [...] Piper told Kimbrough. The bag floated aft and starboard of the station, and did not pose a risk to the station or orbiter. After taking an inventory of the items inside the lost bag, managers on the ground determined that Bowen had all those items in his bag, and the two could share equipment. While it extended the EVA duration slightly, the major objectives were not changed, and all EVA tasks were accomplished. The estimated value of the lost tool bag was US$100,000. An amateur astronomer later observed the tool bag as it orbited the Earth prior to re-entering. It {{was not the first time}} that equipment had got away from spacewalkers, items lost in the past include tools, nuts and bolts, glue guns, cameras, cloths, and even a robotic arm. The United States Space Surveillance Network constantly monitors over 12,500 items in orbit around the Earth.|$|E
