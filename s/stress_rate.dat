30|$|Hiramatsu et al. (2010) have {{proposed}} a new method to estimate a spatial variation in the <b>stressing</b> <b>rate</b> in the crust using a spatial variation in shear wave splitting or coda Q. They obtained {{a variation in the}} <b>stressing</b> <b>rate</b> of 3 ± 0.6 kPa/year in the brittle upper crust, and that of 13 ± 3.5 kPa/year in the ductile part below the brittle-ductile transition zone in the crust, in the NKTZ. We have described details of the distribution of coda Q around the Atotsugawa fault zone in the previous section. It is, therefore, interesting to compare the spatial variation in the <b>stressing</b> <b>rate</b> around the Atotsugawa fault zone to that of the average in the NKTZ.|$|R

30|$|We, thus, {{interpret}} {{that the}} discrepancy between the variations in the <b>stressing</b> <b>rate</b> estimated from shear wave splitting and from coda Q reflects the difference of the variation in <b>stressing</b> <b>rate</b> between the brittle upper crust and the ductile part below the brittle-ductile transition zone in the crust. From this point of view, we prefer the weak zone model (Iio et al., 2002) as the cause of the NKTZ. The weak zone model explains the high strain rate in terms of deformations in a weak zone with lower viscosity in the lower crust beneath the NKTZ. The high deformation rate inferred from the high <b>stressing</b> <b>rate</b> from coda Q possibly suggests that a weak zone is formed by ductile fractures as argued by Jin and Aki (2005).|$|R

30|$|The {{change in}} {{seismicity}} for the stress change was formulized by Dieterich (1994). According to that work, {{because of the}} sudden stress change within {{a period of several}} days, the seismicity increased abruptly and then decreased gradually to the steady-state level (Dieterich 1994; Toda et al. 2002; Lohman and McGuire 2007). On the other hand, for the <b>stressing</b> <b>rate</b> change continuing on the order of 1  month, the seismicity started to increase for several months, and high seismicity conditions continued during the high <b>stressing</b> <b>rate</b> (Toda et al. 2002). The activity of the 2002 afterslip event continued for several years, which corresponds to the long-term <b>stressing</b> <b>rate</b> change. In this case, the seismicity would have continued to increase during several months and high seismicity continued while the faulting of the afterslip continued.|$|R
30|$|Here we {{estimate}} a {{variation in the}} <b>stressing</b> <b>rate</b> in the NKTZ from the spatial variation in the normalized time delay of shear wave splitting. Hiramatsu et al. (2005) reported that the increase in time delay induced by the static stress change due to a moderate size earthquake recovered to the pre-event value within about two years from the observation of shear wave splitting. This means that {{a variation in the}} condition of micro-cracks due to a step-wise stress change recovers to a steady state within about two years. The balance between the opening of micro-cracks due to a constant <b>stressing</b> <b>rate</b> and the rate of the healing of micro-cracks determines the steady state crack condition. As proposed by Hiramatsu et al. (2005), the time constant of the healing of cracks is universally constant. Thus, the normalized time delay {{is expected to be a}} function of the <b>stressing</b> <b>rate.</b> The proportional relationship between the normalized time delay and the differential strain rate supports the proposition by Hiramatsu et al. (2005). The observed variation in the normalized time delay can, therefore, be interpreted to reflect the variation in the <b>stressing</b> <b>rate</b> in the NKTZ.|$|R

In the latter kind an incremental (or rate) formulation is necessary and must be used in every load or time step of a finite element computer program using updated Lagrangian procedure. The absence of a potential raises intricate questions due to the freedom {{in the choice of}} finite strain measure and characterization of the <b>stress</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E
50|$|Low {{frequency}} tremors in the Cascadia {{subduction zone}} are {{strongly associated with}} tidal loading. A number of studies in Cascadia find that the peak low frequency earthquake signals alternate from being in phase with peak tidal shear <b>stress</b> <b>rate</b> to being in phase with peak tidal shear stress, suggesting that LFEs are modulated by changes in sea level. The shear slip events responsible for LFEs are therefore quite sensitive to pressure changes {{in the range of}} several kilo-pascals.|$|E
5000|$|Large strain often {{develops}} {{when the}} material behavior becomes nonlinear, due to plasticity or damage. Then {{the primary cause}} of stress dependence of the tangential moduli is the physical behavior of material. What Eq.

Yet none of them is fundamentally preferable, except if there exists one <b>stress</b> <b>rate,</b> one , for which the moduli can be considered constant.|$|E
40|$|Time-dependent {{creep stress}} {{redistribution}} analysis of thick-walled FGM spheres subjected {{to an internal}} pressure and a uniform temperature field is investigated. The material creep and mechanical properties through the radial graded direction are assumed to obey the simple power-law variation throughout the thickness. Total strains {{are assumed to be}} the sum of elastic, thermal and creep strains. Creep strains are time temperature and stress dependent. Using equations of equilibrium, compatibility and stress-strain relations a differential equation, containing creep strains, for radial stress is obtained. Ignoring creep strains in this differential equation, a closed form solution for initial thermo-elastic stresses at zero time is presented. Initial thermo-elastic stresses are illustrated for different material properties. Using Prandtl-Reuss relation in conjunction with the above differential equation and the Norton’s law for the material uni-axial creep constitutive model, radial and tangential creep <b>stress</b> <b>rates</b> are obtained. These creep <b>stress</b> <b>rates</b> are containing integrals of effective stress and are evaluated numerically. Creep <b>stress</b> <b>rates</b> are plotted against dimensionless radius for different material properties. Using creep <b>stress</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>stress</b> redistributions are calculated iteratively using thermo-elastic stresses as initial values for stress redistributions. It has been found that radial stress redistributions are not significant for different material properties. However, major redistributions occur for tangential and effective stresses...|$|R
30|$|To {{understand}} {{the state of}} the stress in the high strain rate zone, called the NKTZ, and the cause of the NKTZ, we investigate a detailed spatial variation in shear wave splitting in the crust using waveform data at dense seismic stations. We find that the orientation of the faster polarized shear wave is parallel to the axis of the maximum horizontal compressional strain rate estimated from GPS data at most stations. We call this type as the stress induced anisotropy because the principal axes of the strain rate coincides with those of the horizontal stress in the analyzed region. On the other hand, the orientation of the faster polarized shear wave is parallel to the strike of active faults at some stations, indicating the structure induced anisotropy. A proportional relationship between the time delays normalized by the path length in the anisotropic upper crust and the differential strain rate confirms that the strength of the crustal anisotropy is controlled by the strain <b>rate</b> or the <b>stressing</b> <b>rate.</b> A spatial variation in <b>stressing</b> <b>rate</b> of the upper crust beneath the NKTZ is estimated using a response of the normalized time delay to a step-wise stress change caused by a moderate-sized earthquake. The variation in <b>stressing</b> <b>rate</b> estimated from shear wave splitting is 3 kPa/year. This value is coincident with a corresponding <b>stressing</b> <b>rate</b> of 3 kPa/year estimated from GPS data. <b>Stressing</b> <b>rate</b> estimated from coda Q and seismological features in the NKTZ indicate that the ductile fractures below the brittle-ductile transition zone can cause high deformation rate in the crust, resulting in the high strain rate at surface of the NKTZ.|$|R
