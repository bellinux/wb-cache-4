40|$|The main {{features}} of DLR’s dextrous robot hand as a modular {{component of a}} complete robotics system are outlined in this paper. The application of robotics systems in unstructured servicing environments requires dextrous manipulation abilities and facilities to perjorm complex remote operations in a vet-y jlexible way. Therefore we have developed a multisenso ~ articulated four jinger hand, where all actuators are integrated in the hand’s palm or the jingers directly. It is an integrated part of a complex light-weight manipulation system aiming at the development of robonauts for space. After {{a brief description of}} the hand and it’s <b>sensorial</b> <b>equipment</b> the hard- and so~are architecture is outlined with particular emphasis on flexibility and performance issues. The hand is typically controlled through a data glove for telemanipulation and skill-transfer purposes. Autonomous grasping and manipulation capabilities are currently under development...|$|E
40|$|In space applications, it is {{conceivable}} that part of the robotic activities could involve the grasp and/or manipulation of free-floating objects in absence of gravity. In this case, synchronous application of contacts seems to represent a basic feature in order to efficiently grasp the floating items. In this sense, an additional difficulty is that objects may have irregular shape and/or be non well positioned in the gripper workspace. These difficulties cannot be handled in a simple way with standard 2 -jaw grippers, with one (or two) degrees of freedom. In this paper, an activity for designing and experimenting a gripper for this type of operations is reported, and the first laboratory results are presented and discussed. Main features of the gripper are its kinematic configuration (3 fingers with 3 dof) and its <b>sensorial</b> <b>equipment,</b> features that improve the dexterity of this device if compared to more classical devices...|$|E
40|$|In {{the space}} context, {{because of the}} {{technical}} difficulties, dangerous environment, high cost of communi-cations and of human presence and so on, the development of devices for autonomous or semi-autonomous operations is a key point for present and future researches. In this scenario, an important role will be played by robotics systems, able to interact with and to operate in a possibly unstructured environment. Aim of this work is to show how a robotic arm/gripper system and a vision system can be properly in-tegrated {{in order to achieve}} the capability to autonomously perform the grasp of unknown objects. The gripper (currently mounted on a standard industrial manipulator) has been purposely designed for space applications. As a matter of fact, its kinematic configuration (3 one-dof fingers) and its <b>sensorial</b> <b>equipment</b> (including position, force and proximity sensors), improve the dexterity of this device if compared to more classical 2 -jaw devices, usually used in space. In particular, the features of the proposed device (besides its wide workspace and the possibility to grasp objects with irregular shapes and/or non well positioned within its workspace) make it particularly suitable to deal with free-floating objects in absence of gravity...|$|E
40|$|This study {{refers to}} {{morphological}} observations {{carried out on}} oral structures and head <b>sensorial</b> <b>equipment</b> of juveniles and adult of A. naccarii, {{taking into account the}} scarcity of bibliographic data pertaining to such structures in this species. SEM and histological examination were performed on a 9 -year-old (mature male, weight: 9 kg; SL: 108 cm) adult and a 180 -day-old juvenile (weight 10 gr; SL: 14. 5 cm), from two different induced reproductions carried out in 1992 and 1997, respectively, at VIP fish farm (Orzinuovi, Brescia, Italy) and reared at ENEL Thermal Aquaculture experimental plant "La Casella" (Piacenza, Italy). The morphological and histological results can be interpreted as follows: i) a 180 day-old sturgeon should be considered still a juvenile, as revealed by the presence of some still persisting transitional structures (e. g. teeth); ii) with the exception of olfaction (not treated in this study), the most important sense organ in the external rostro-ventral region of the head are the ampullar organs, which are able to perceive electrical stimuli. These organs are similar to those described in Gymnotidae and Mormyridae by Szabo (1974) with both ciliated columnar and mono-ciliated pear-shaped sensory cells; iii) the sturgeon scans the surrounding environment in search of signals of the presence of food through the olfactory organ, which is considered to be the system with the greatest effective range (more than 100 m) in many fish species, including sturgeons. Again, the head lateral line and ampullar organs ensure more precise and closer orientation of the fish towards the source of the signal. The inner and outer taste buds confer on juveniles a differential sensitivity to prey taste. External taste buds {{play a role in the}} preliminary determination of the suitability of food, intervening in the decision whether to seize the item or not. The taste receptors in the mouth, which are assumed to be more sensitive and to perceive a wider range of substances than the outer buds, are involved in the final verification of the quality of the prey seized (swallow or reject it) ...|$|E
30|$|In {{contrast}} to our results, Cu {{was reported to}} be considerably toxic for IJs of EPN (Jaworska and Gorczyca, 2002; Sun et al., 2016). Sambongi et al. (1999) reported that nematodes have elaborated <b>sensorial</b> <b>equipment,</b> including receptors for copper ions, which enables them to avoid their intake. Therefore, it was surprising to discover that Cu was the most abundant element in all nematode isolates in our study and its concentration was the highest among all the other studied elements. However, Jaworska et al. (1997 a) mentioned that Fe and Cu ions vitalized IJs of Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and increased their mobility and pathogenic abilities which could support our findings. One explanation for the high level of Cu concentration in all the studied EPN isolates is that nematodes during their early stages inside the insect body collect and accumulate Cu from the surrounding Cu-rich insect hemolymph (Malik and Malik, 2009). However this explanation does not elucidate the significant difference in Cu concentration between the two nematode families. Another plausible explanation is that Cu accumulation in IJs could be due to bacteria associated with EPN, for which Cu is known to be an essential trace element (Kuzuya and Inouye, 2001; Massaoud et al., 2011). The nematode bacteria of Photorhabdus for Heterorhabditis spp. and Xenorhabdus for the Steinernema spp. produce a range of activities, including hydrolytic enzymes, that converting the insects’ internal organs and tissues into bacterial biomass (Watson et al., 2010). Photorhabdus secreted more than four proteases such as PrtA peptidase, PhpC (Photorhabdus protease C), thermolysin-like enzymes, and other enzymes that may be used in the suppression of the immune responses, while only one proteolytic enzyme (protease B) has been partially characterized in Xenorhabdus strains (Massaoud et al., 2010, 2011). Although thermolysin-like enzymes are related to zinc metalloenzymes, it was found that Cu and Co ions increased their activities to 200 % of their original one, while Zn alone is insufficient (Holmquist and Vallee, 1974; Kuzuya and Inouye, 2001 and Massaoud et al., 2011). Thus, it could be concluded that Photorhabdus bacteria of Heterorhabditis spp. accumulate Cu and Co for activation of their metalloenzymes to enhance their virulence. This conclusion could be supported by the finding that concentrations of Cu and Co ions in nematode isolates related to heterorhabditid EPN family were significantly higher than the ones related to Steinernematidae family lacking of Photorhabdus bacteria. The uptake of Photorhabdus bacteria associated with Heterorhabditidae EPN to Fe could also explain the detected high concentrations of Fe ions in IJs and also explains their significant higher concentration in nematode isolates related to Heterorhabditidae family than concentration in isolates related to Steinernematidae family in the present study. Iron is an essential nutrient for bacteria that have different mechanisms for obtaining both the ferrous (Fe 2 +) and ferric (Fe 3 +) forms of this metal from their environments. Watson et al. (2010) constructed P. luminescens mutant bacteria that was predicted to be crippled in its ability to obtain Fe 3 + from surrounding. They found that this mutant does not grow well in iron-limited media and lost their ability to kill insects and concluded that Fe++ was essential for P. luminescens bacteria of Heterorhabditidae-related nematodes. However, further experiments might determine whether Cu, Fe, and Co are concentrated in IJs or in bacteria associated with the EPNs.|$|E
