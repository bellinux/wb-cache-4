2500|$|Her {{style is}} powerfully evocative and spare and she employs mostly free verse (though aware of other forms). Though {{for the most}} part she is a lyric poet, traces of oral Indian {{tradition}} and the chant come through in her poetry. As <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> her introduction to Bone Dance, “if the words cannot be sung in the genuine language of the old way, they must be written.” ...|$|E

She belonged to the prestigious Daju people; [...] her well {{respected}} and reasonably prosperous father was brother of the village chief. She was surrounded by a loving family of three brothers and three sisters; as <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> her autobiography: [...] "I lived a very happy and carefree life, without knowing what suffering".|$|E

However, he is never shown to fight in battle. Diana makes a comment about the future King and Queen. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> SuperS that the King and Queen like to fake being sick to be excused from attending important banquets and meetings. In the original English dub, he was not referred to as Endymion; only the [...] "King of the Earth" [...] or [...] "The King" [...] or [...] "King Darien".|$|E

2500|$|Much of Barrett Browning's work {{carries a}} {{religious}} theme. She had read and studied such works as Milton's Paradise Lost and Dante's Inferno. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> her writing, [...] "We want {{the sense of}} the saturation of Christ's blood upon the souls of our poets, that it may cry through them in answer to the ceaseless wail of the Sphinx of our humanity, expounding agony into renovation. Something of this has been perceived in art when its glory was at the fullest. Something of a yearning after this may be seen among the Greek Christian poets, something which would have been much with a stronger faculty". She believed that [...] "Christ's religion is essentially poetry — poetry glorified". She explored the religious aspect in many of her poems, especially in her early work, such as the sonnets.|$|E

6000|$|... "Are {{there no}} {{servants}} in the house? It looks,--it looks--. But I am {{the last person}} in the world to form a harsh judgment of a young woman at such a moment as this. What did <b>she</b> <b>say</b> <b>in</b> her letter, Fred?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Paul, [...] "if {{she looks}} at a man <b>she</b> <b>says</b> haughtily 'Nevermore,' and if {{she looks at}} herself <b>in</b> the looking-glass <b>she</b> <b>says</b> disdainfully 'Nevermore,' and if she thinks back <b>she</b> <b>says</b> it <b>in</b> disgust, and if she looks forward <b>she</b> <b>says</b> it cynically." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{would be}} {{impossible}} to say [...] "yes" [...] in a tone that would be taken seriously; equally impossible to say [...] "no;" [...] but what else could <b>she</b> <b>say?</b> <b>In</b> her difficulty, <b>she</b> turned down her eyelids again and blushed over face and neck. Grandcourt saw her in a new phase, and believed that she was showing her inclination. But he was determined that she should show it more decidedly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aha!" [...] he said. [...] "I {{see what}} it is. I snuff, I smoke, I reek of tobaccos. The pretty Miss smells me. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> her inmost heart--Ach Gott, how he stink!" ...|$|E

60|$|The {{presence}} of her sister-in-law made Lady Otway slightly uneasy. How could she {{go on with}} what <b>she</b> was <b>saying</b> <b>in</b> Maggie's presence? for <b>she</b> was <b>saying</b> something that <b>she</b> had never said, all these years, to Maggie herself.|$|R
6000|$|A {{touching}} little {{incident is}} related by Mrs Veneering, {{in the course}} of the evening.

6000|$|... "It may be so. We will try. But you {{see what}} <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> her letter to him. She writes as though your {{authority}} were to be nothing in that matter of giving up. In all that she says to me there is the same spirit. If she is firm, Duke, you must yield." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, {{she will}} {{accompany}} you, dear Prince,' <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>in</b> her most coaxing accents. 'First, {{we must get}} the jewels belonging to our royal parents. and those of her and his present Majesty. Here is the key, duck; they are all yours, you know, by right, for you are the rightful King of Paflagonia, and your wife will be the rightful Queen.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; not at all, I believe. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> he's <b>in</b> Boston {{merely as}} a matter of duty, to {{chaperon}} her at parties, and save her mother from having to go with her." ...|$|R

5000|$|According to her Internet diary at nancycrick.com (now defunct), Nancy {{spent most}} of her time on the toilet. Melbourne {{newspaper}} The Age commented: [...] "What <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>she</b> does <b>in</b> there is neither dignified nor pleasant.

6000|$|... “I’ll go {{and stay}} with any one who will take me or ask me. It’s a real nostalgie. <b>She</b> <b>says</b> that <b>in</b> New York—in Thirty-Seventh Street near Fourth Avenue—I should have the most lovely time.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There was {{the same}} {{wondering}} look in her eyes--only wilder than I had ever seen it yet--while I was speaking. When I'd done, <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> the same strange way, 'Speak out, mother; I can't hear you when you whisper like that.' She was as long saying these words, and bungled over them as much, {{as if she was}} only just learning to speak. I think I got the first suspicion then, of what had really happened. 'Mary!' I bawled out as loud as I could, 'Mary! can't you hear me?' She shook her head, and stared up at me with the frightened, bewildered look again: then seemed to get pettish and impatient all of a sudden--the first time I ever saw her so--and hid her face from me on the pillow.|$|E
6000|$|In {{philosophy}} {{she was a}} Platonist, {{in politics}} an Opportunist. She attached herself to no particular party. She loved the people when they were king-like, and kings when they showed themselves to be men. Of the real value and motive of poetry she had a most exalted idea. ‘Poetry,’ <b>she</b> <b>says,</b> <b>in</b> the preface {{of one of her}} volumes, ‘has been as serious a thing to me as life itself; and life has been a very serious thing. There has been no playing at skittles for me in either. I never mistook pleasure for the final cause of poetry, nor leisure for the hour of the poet. I have done my work so far, not as mere hand and head work apart from the personal being, but as the completest expression of that being to which I could attain.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So <b>she</b> <b>says</b> <b>in</b> her letters. I {{heard from}} her yesterday, and I brought the letter, as I thought you'd like to see it." [...] Mrs. Grantly took the letter and read it, while her father still played with the child. The archdeacon and the major were {{standing}} together on the rug discussing the shooting at Chaldicotes, as to which the archdeacon had a strong opinion. [...] "I'm quite sure that {{a man with a}} place like that does more good by preserving than by leaving it alone. The better head of game he has the richer the county will be generally. It is just the same with pheasants as it is with sheep and bullocks. A pheasant doesn't cost more than he's worth any more than a barn-door fowl. Besides, a man who preserves is always respected by the poachers, and the man who doesn't is not." ...|$|E
