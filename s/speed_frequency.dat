30|$|Wind {{energy is}} an {{important}} alternative to conventional energy resources. Therefore, one may find many studies related to modeling wind characteristics such as wind speed in order to estimate the potential for use in generating energy. It can be observed that distributions such as Weibull, Rayleigh, gamma, lognormal, beta, Burr, and inverse Gaussian distributions are used in modeling wind <b>speed</b> <b>frequencies</b> [17]. As noted before, the two additional parameters in the Kum-G distribution families may provide more flexibility in modeling. For example, the Kum-Weibull family of distributions include the Weibull and Rayleigh distributions as special cases. Motivated by this fact the Kum-Weibull, Kum-Pareto and Kum-Power families of distributions are applied to model wind <b>speed</b> <b>frequencies</b> for a particular location, Cide, in Turkey.
