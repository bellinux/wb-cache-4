In {{the field of}} pulses, physicians followed the teachings of Galen, identifying pulse according to size, strength, <b>speed,</b> <b>frequency</b> of a series, and hardness or softness. The Byzantine physician John Zacharias Aktouarios states that a physician needs an exceptionally sensitive hand and a clear mind. John Zacharias Aktouarios also had a large impact {{in the field of}} urology. In Byzantine diagnostics urine was used to identify different types of illness. John Zacharias Aktouarios created a vial that separated urine into eleven different sections. The section in which the sediments or different colors appeared in the vial correlated to a different body part. For instance, if there were clouds on top of the vial this was thought to represent infections of the head.|$|E

30|$|Wind {{energy is}} an {{important}} alternative to conventional energy resources. Therefore, one may find many studies related to modeling wind characteristics such as wind speed in order to estimate the potential for use in generating energy. It can be observed that distributions such as Weibull, Rayleigh, gamma, lognormal, beta, Burr, and inverse Gaussian distributions are used in modeling wind <b>speed</b> <b>frequencies</b> [17]. As noted before, the two additional parameters in the Kum-G distribution families may provide more flexibility in modeling. For example, the Kum-Weibull family of distributions include the Weibull and Rayleigh distributions as special cases. Motivated by this fact the Kum-Weibull, Kum-Pareto and Kum-Power families of distributions are applied to model wind <b>speed</b> <b>frequencies</b> for a particular location, Cide, in Turkey.
