5|$|Schizophrenia {{and smoking}} {{have shown a}} strong {{association}} in studies worldwide. Use of cigarettes is especially high in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia, with estimates ranging from 80 to 90% being regular smokers, as compared to 20% of the general population. Those who smoke tend to smoke heavily, and additionally <b>smoke</b> <b>cigarettes</b> with high nicotine content. Among people with schizophrenia use of cannabis is also common.|$|E
5|$|Externalizing {{disorders}} (i.e., acting-out disorders) show {{a clearer}} link to delayed gratification, since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control. For example, {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) and aggressive behavior are associated with difficulty delaying gratification in children and adolescents, as are substance abuse, gambling, and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults. In a 2010 study, teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol, or to <b>smoke</b> <b>cigarettes</b> or cannabis. Interestingly, a 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for IQ (in other words, ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ). This may stem from the high correlation between intelligence and delayed gratification, and suggests that the tie between delayed gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation.|$|E

25|$|It is also {{possible}} that panic disorder patients <b>smoke</b> <b>cigarettes</b> as a form of self-medication to lessen anxiety. Nicotine and other psychoactive compounds with antidepressant properties in tobacco smoke which act as monoamine oxidase inhibitors in the brain can alter mood and have a calming effect, depending on dose.|$|E
25|$|Behavioural {{research}} generally {{indicates that}} teenagers begin their smoking habits due to peer pressure, and cultural influence portrayed by friends. However, {{one study found}} that direct pressure to <b>smoke</b> <b>cigarettes</b> played a less significant part in adolescent smoking, with adolescents also reporting low levels of both normative and direct pressure to <b>smoke</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> Mere exposure to tobacco retailers may motivate smoking behaviour in adults. A similar study suggested that individuals may play {{a more active role in}} starting to smoke than has previously been thought and that social processes other than peer pressure also need to be taken into account. Another study's results indicated that peer pressure was significantly associated with smoking behavior across all age and gender cohorts, but that intrapersonal factors were significantly more important to the smoking behavior of 12- to 13-year-old girls than same-age boys. Within the 14- to 15-year-old age group, one peer pressure variable emerged as a significantly more important predictor of girls' than boys' smoking. It is debated whether peer pressure or self-selection is a greater cause of adolescent smoking.|$|E

25|$|To {{examine the}} effects of {{progesterone}} on nicotine addiction, participants in one study were either treated orally with a progesterone treatment, or treated with a placebo. When treated with progesterone, participants exhibited enhanced suppression of smoking urges, reported higher ratings of “bad effects” from IV nicotine, and reported lower ratings of “drug liking”. These results suggest that progesterone not only alters the subjective effects of nicotine, but reduces the urge to <b>smoke</b> <b>cigarettes.</b>|$|E

25|$|Ever {{since the}} era of silent films, smoking has had a major part in film symbolism.

Some of Gardner's changes do remain, for instance, Benson's Bond continues to <b>smoke</b> <b>cigarettes</b> from H.

Additionally, the Bond girls Fredericka von Grüsse (Never Send Flowers / SeaFire), Harriet Horner (Scorpius), and Easy St. John (Death is Forever) are all mentioned. Further novels by Benson also retain some aspects of Gardner's series though there is equally just as much that he ignores.|$|E

25|$|Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser): A young, ambitious account {{executive}} {{from an old}} New York family with connections and a privileged background. Often displaying recurring lapses in experience and judgement, Campbell's ruthless {{climb to the top}} causes him to attempt to blackmail Don Draper with the Dick Whitman information he has learned, but it does not work. He and Don are antagonistic some of the time, but later develop a grudging respect for each other, culminating in Don's approaching Pete over Ken Cosgrove when forming a new agency. Campbell and his wife, Trudy, were unable to conceive a child early in their marriage, and he only learned of his child with Olson at the Season 2 finale. He and Trudy do conceive a daughter, Tammy, late in Season 4. At the end of Season 3, dissatisfied with his treatment at Sterling Cooper regarding a promotion, he secretly plans to leave the firm. Unaware of this, Don Draper approaches Campbell with an offer to join his new firm as long as Pete brings accounts worth $8 million of cash flow. Campbell decides to join Draper, with the condition that he be made a partner, though his surname does not appear in the new firm's name (Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce). Campbell {{is one of the few}} characters in the show who does not <b>smoke</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> though he is seen smoking marijuana on one occasion. He looks up to Don in many ways. Campbell is often shown cheating on his wife, and is not above manipulating and blackmailing women to get them to sleep with him. While Pete and Trudy separate in Season 6 after another one of his affairs, the two reconcile at the end of the series as Pete takes a lucrative offer with Learjet in Wichita, Kansas.|$|E

[...] It is not known what underlies this effect. Tobacco use may actually protect against PD, or it may be that an unknown factor both increases the risk of PD and causes an aversion to tobacco or makes it easier to quit using tobacco.|$|E

500|$|By 1930, MacArthur was still, at age 50, the {{youngest}} of the U.S. Army's major generals, and the best known. He left the Philippines on 19 September 1930 and for a brief time was in command of the IX Corps Area in San Francisco. On 21 November, he was sworn in as Chief of Staff of the United States Army, with the rank of general. While in Washington, he would ride home each day to have lunch with his mother. At his desk, he would wear a Japanese ceremonial kimono, cool himself with an oriental fan, and <b>smoke</b> <b>cigarettes</b> in a jeweled cigarette holder. In the evenings, he liked to read military history books. About this time, he began referring to himself as [...] "MacArthur". He had already hired a public relations staff to promote his image with the American public, together with a set of ideas he was known to favor, namely: a belief that America needed a strongman leader to deal with the possibility that Communists might lead all of the great masses of unemployed into a revolution; that America's destiny was in the Asia-Pacific region; and a strong hostility to the British Empire. One contemporary described MacArthur as the greatest actor to ever serve as a U.S Army general while another wrote that MacArthur had a court rather than a staff.|$|E
