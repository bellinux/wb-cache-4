This {{may be attributed}} to the microstructures metal-isolator-metal, metal-oxide-metal and metal-gas-metal which are formed on the apparent contacting area, as oxides and other chemical compounds create interfacial layers. Work function changes of the contacting metals can modulate the effective barrier height and width, resulting in a significant change of the crossing resistance in contacts, even during a time interval of the period. Nonlinear behaviour is developed beyond a threshold field value determinated by the voltage drop at the contact. According to the experimental results it becomes evident that at the stage of moderate degradation, tunnelling occurs.

30|$|Designing low-dissipation Riemann solvers for RMHD is a {{challenging}} enterprise. An exact RMHD Riemann solver exists (Giacomazzo and Rezzolla 2006; Giacomazzo and Rezzolla 2007), {{but it is}} not practicable for use in numerical codes. HLLC Riemann solvers for RMHD exist (Mignone and Bodo 2006; Honkkila and Janhunen 2007; Kim and Balsara 2014). They enable a <b>stationary</b> <b>contact</b> discontinuity to be captured on a mesh. However, they dissipate stationary Alfven waves just like an HLL Riemann solver. HLLD Riemann solvers for RMHD (Mignone et al. 2009), do exist, which enable <b>stationary</b> <b>contact</b> discontinuities as well as stationary Alfvenic discontinuities to be captured on a computational mesh. Unfortunately, the method is iterative, which makes it computationally very expensive. Furthermore, when an iteration fails to converge, the method becomes brittle. With the emergence of the HLLI Riemann solver (Dumbser and Balsara 2016), it has become possible to capture <b>stationary</b> <b>contact</b> discontinuities as well as stationary Alfvenic discontinuities using a Riemann solver that is non-iterative and computationally inexpensive. The first goal {{of this paper is to}} document this capability in the astrophysical literature.|$|E

30|$|HLLD Riemann solvers. Mignone et al. (2009), also {{enable a}} code to capture <b>stationary,</b> {{isolated}} <b>contact</b> discontinuities {{as well as}} stationary, isolated Alfven waves. But {{they have their own}} set of attendant problems, as discussed in the Introduction. HLLC Riemann solvers (Mignone and Bodo 2006; Honkkila and Janhunen 2007; Kim and Balsara 2014), represent a compromise position where they enable a code to capture <b>stationary,</b> isolated <b>contact</b> discontinuities, but not Alfven waves. The HLLI Riemann solver of Dumbser and Balsara (2016) is built on top of an HLL Riemann solver, so it inherits all the beneficial positivity properties of the HLL Riemann solver. However, it introduces sub-structure in the Riemann fan. Typically, that substructure includes the contribution from eigenvectors of the contact discontinuity and eigenvectors associated with Alfven waves. The eigenvectors for the fast and slow magnetosonic waves are very expensive to evaluate computationally, and their evaluation is avoided in the HLLI Riemann solver. As a result, the HLLI Riemann solver enables a code to capture <b>stationary,</b> isolated <b>contact</b> discontinuities as well as stationary, isolated Alfven waves at a very low computational cost. Unlike HLLC and HLLD, the HLLI Riemann solver does not require an iterative solution, thereby ensuring that it has even lower computational cost. In the next few paragraphs we demonstrate this facet of the HLLI Riemann solver for RMHD.|$|R

The few uses for electricity, such as electroplating, used direct current provided by messy liquid batteries. Dynamos were invented as a replacement for batteries. The commutator is essentially a rotary switch. It consists of a set of contacts mounted on the machine's shaft, combined with graphite-block <b>stationary</b> <b>contacts,</b> called [...] "brushes", because the earliest such fixed contacts were metal brushes.

40|$|By {{integrating}} {{effects of}} microscopic interactions between statisticaly selfsimilar fault surfaces, we succeeded in deriving a slip- and time-dependent fault constitutive law that rationally unifies the slip-dependent {{law and the}} rate- and state-dependent law (Aochi and Matsu'ura, 1998 [1]). In this constitutive law the slip-weakening results from the abrasion of surface asperities that proceeds irreversibly with fault slip. On the other hand, the restoration of shear strength after the arrest of fault slip results from the adhesion of surface asperities that proceeds with contact time. The slip- and timedependent law can explain three basic experimental results; slip-weakening in high-speed slip, log t-healing in <b>stationary</b> <b>contact,</b> and velocity-weakening in steady state slip.

30|$|The Introduction {{has shown}} {{that it is very}} {{desirable}} to have Riemann solvers that can capture <b>stationary,</b> isolated <b>contact</b> discontinuities as well as stationary, isolated Alfven waves. Indeed the first of the one-dimensional Riemann solvers for RMHD by Komissarov (1999) and Balsara (2001) were Roe-type Riemann solvers. Because such Riemann solvers retain the entire set of eigenvectors for the RMHD system, they can indeed capture <b>stationary,</b> isolated <b>contact</b> discontinuities as well as stationary, isolated Alfven waves on a mesh. There has been a recent effort by AntÃ³n et al. (2010) to revive the use of Roe-type Riemann solvers in RMHD simulations, but the effort has met with limited success owing to the exorbitant computational cost of such Riemann solvers, especially for RMHD. The Roe-type Riemann solvers also have an inherent deficiency. This has to do with their loss of positivity of density and pressure in certain circumstances (Einfeldt 1988; Einfeldt et al. 1991). It is easy to find mentions in the early literature on RMHD (Komissarov 1999, 2004, 2005), showing that the early RMHD simulation codes struggled with positivity issues and, therefore, reverted {{to the use of the}} HLL Riemann solver.
