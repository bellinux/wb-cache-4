25|$|Some <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> are {{provided}} with software which uses a vendor-specific and usually closed-source algorithm to determine the 3D profile of the sample from the four-quadrant BSE detector. The supplied algorithms can be very simple line-by-line approaches, that only compare pixels next to each other. Due to the sample and conditions changing, this produces reasonable results only along the scan direction and is only practical for 1D line cuts along the scanning axis. Other approaches use more sophisticated (and sometimes GPU-intensive) methods like the optimal estimation algorithm and offer much better results {{at the cost of}} high demands on computing power.|$|E
25|$|Hexaborides, LnB6 {{have been}} {{reported}} {{for all of the}} lanthanides. They all have the CaB6 structure, containing B6 clusters. They are non-stoichiometric due to cation defects. The hexaborides of the lighter lanthanides (La – Sm) melt without decomposition, EuB6 decomposes to boron and metal and the heavier lanthanides decompose to LnB4 with exception of YbB6 which decomposes forming YbB12. The stability has in part been correlated to differences in volatility between the lanthanide metals. In EuB6 and YbB6 the metals have an oxidation state of +2 whereas {{in the rest of the}} lanthanide hexaborides it is +3. This rationalises the differences in conductivity, the extra electrons in the LnIII hexaborides entering conduction bands. EuB6 is a semiconductor and the rest are good conductors. LaB6 and CeB6 are thermionic emitters, used, for example, in <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{proposal}} {{to assess the}} quality of <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> images using mixed Lagrange time delay estimation technique is presented. With optimal <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> <b>scan</b> rate information, online images can be quantified and improved. The online quality assessment technique is embedded onto a <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> frame grabber card for real-time image processing. Different images are captured using <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> and a database is built to optimally choose filter parameters. An optimum choice of filter parameters is obtained. With the optimum choice of scan rate, noise can be removed from real-time <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> images without causing any sample contamination or increasing scanning time...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{adaptation}} of the <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (SEM) to the environmental <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> (ESEM). ESEM allows work at higher pressure {{in some parts of}} the microscope. It focuses especially to the construction and assembly of the differential pumping chamber together with the detector board of the differential pumping chamber and it comments reasons of necessity of the assembly of these parts in the environmental <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope...</b>|$|R
40|$|Uterine biopsies {{from normal}} cyclic cows were optimally {{prepared}} for examination in a <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope.</b> After examination in the <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> the same tissues were routinely processed for paraffin sectioning and reexamined {{with the light}} microscope. Results indicate that the <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscope</b> is satisfactory for examination of the fine surface structure of the endometrium and the light microscope for subsurface structures of the bovine uterus...|$|R
25|$|Generally, {{the image}} {{resolution}} of an SEM {{is lower than}} that of a TEM. However, because the SEM images the surface of a sample rather than its interior, the electrons do not have to travel through the sample. This reduces the need for extensive sample preparation to thin the specimen to electron transparency. The SEM is able to image bulk samples that can fit on its stage and still be maneuvered, including a height less than the working distance being used, often 4 millimeters for high resolution images. The SEM also has a great depth of field, and so can produce images that are good representations of the three-dimensional surface shape of the sample. Another advantage of SEMs comes with environmental <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> (ESEM) that can produce images of good quality and resolution with hydrated samples or in low, rather than high, vacuum or under chamber gases. This facilitates imaging unfixed biological samples that are unstable in the high vacuum of conventional electron microscopes.|$|E
500|$|Two main {{types of}} {{electron}} microscopes exist: transmission and scanning. Transmission electron microscopes function like overhead projectors, with {{a beam of}} electrons passing through a slice of material then being projected by lenses on a photographic slide or a charge-coupled device. [...] <b>Scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> rasteri a finely focused electron beam, as in a TV set, across the studied sample to produce the image. Magnifications range from 100× to 1,000,000× or higher for both microscope types. The scanning tunneling microscope uses quantum tunneling of electrons from a sharp metal tip into the studied material and can produce atomically resolved images of its surface.|$|E
500|$|Except {{for a few}} {{possible}} glyphs cut {{in stone}} (see petroglyphs), all surviving texts are inscribed in wood. According to tradition, the tablets were made of toromiro wood. However, Orliac (2005) examined seven objects (tablets B, C, G, H, K, Q, and reimiro L) with stereo optical and <b>scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> and determined that all were instead made from Pacific rosewood (Thespesia populnea); the same identification had been made for tablet M in 1934. This 15-meter tree, known as [...] "Pacific rosewood" [...] for its color and called mako‘i in Rapanui, is used for sacred groves and carvings throughout eastern Polynesia and was evidently brought to Easter Island by the first settlers. However, not all the wood was native: Orliac (2007) established that tablets N, P, and S were made of South African Yellowwood (Podocarpus latifolius) and therefore that the wood had arrived with Western contact. Fischer describes P as [...] "a damaged and reshapen European or American oar", as are A (which is European ash, Fraxinus excelsior) and V; notes that wood from the wreck of a Western boat {{was said to have}} been used for many tablets; and that both P and S had been recycled as planking for a Rapanui driftwood canoe, suggesting that by that time the tablets had little value to the islanders as texts. Several texts, including O, are carved on gnarled driftwood. The fact that the islanders were reduced to inscribing driftwood, and were regardless extremely economical in their use of wood, may have had consequences for the structure of the script, such as the abundance of ligatures and potentially a telegraphic style of writing that would complicate textual analysis.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Scanning</b> <b>electron</b> <b>microscopes</b> {{operating}} in conventional high-vacuum mode usually image conductive specimens; therefore non-conductive materials require conductive coating (gold/palladium alloy, carbon, osmium, etc.). The low-voltage mode of modern microscopes makes possible {{the observation of}} non-conductive specimens without coating. [...] Non-conductive materials can be imaged also by a variable pressure (or environmental) scanning electron microscope.|$|E
