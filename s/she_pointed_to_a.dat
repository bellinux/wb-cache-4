60|$|I {{rose and}} {{followed}} her. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> miniature portrait, hanging above the mantelpiece.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> chair near her. Something in {{the action}} brought color to his cheeks.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> tall erect figure slowly disappearing on {{the other}} side of the hedge.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have his}} letters," [...] {{answered}} the elderly lady. [...] "They {{are in the}} bureau yonder." [...] And <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> ancient chest of drawers.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no; {{you have}} said it; you shall choose something. Will you have those vases?" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> almost matchless {{specimen}} of old Sevres porcelain.|$|R
60|$|They {{passed into}} the cool, geranium-scented hall. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> easy-chair {{by the side of}} which was set, on a small {{mahogany}} table, a silver cocktail shaker and two glasses.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> chair {{when they}} reached the veranda, and then sank languidly into one close by.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> few scrubby bushes {{overhanging}} {{a little}} stream, which passed under the road near this point.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> ledge of rock {{above the}} opening where the great stone {{that had fallen}} had lodged.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I could," [...] she answered, smiling, [...] "for then {{my dream}} {{might have been}} true, and {{you might have been}} that knight whose brass is lost," [...] and <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> empty matrix {{alongside}} that of the great Plantagenet lady.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes they would," [...] said Estelle; [...] "I'm {{sure they}} would. There {{are so many}} English {{travellers}} going on these roads now, {{that it must be}} that they have men here that speak English. There's a man," [...] said <b>she,</b> <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> person in livery who was standing within a sort of enclosure.|$|R
60|$|Lady Deringham {{smiled and}} greeted him graciously. Mr. Sabin leaned upon his {{wonderful}} stick for a moment, and then bent low over Lady Deringham's hand. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> easy chair {{close to her}} own, and he sank into it with some appearance of weariness. He was looking a little old and tired, and he carried himself without any of his usual buoyancy.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> slouching peon with a malevolent face, who was angrily {{driving the}} mustang toward the corral.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> small brass tray {{which stood}} {{on the table in}} among the litter of bottles, glasses, mugs and tobacco-jars.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There she is!' {{cried the}} little girl. 'Listen! She is sitting there!' And <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> little dark-grey bird {{up in the}} branches.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> faintly <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{letter on}} the floor--Valencia caught it up-- Lucia {{made a gesture}} as if to stop her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{entered a}} certain drawing-room {{about a week}} ago," [...] I said. [...] "'We were just {{speaking}} about you,' exclaimed my hostess. 'Is not this yours?' <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> article in a certain magazine lying open on the table. 'No,' I replied; 'one or two people have asked me that same question. It seems <b>to</b> me rather <b>an</b> absurd article,' I added. 'I cannot say I thought very much of it,' agreed my hostess." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stewart, I see {{you carry}} a gun," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> black handle {{protruding}} from a sheath swinging low along his leather chaps.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> writing-table {{and went}} away, {{while the first}} letters so amazed Geraldine that {{she could think of}} nothing else, and hastened to summon Clement.|$|E
6000|$|Hester came in {{with the}} breakfast. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> letter among other things on the tray. It was {{addressed}} to Anne, in Geoffrey's handwriting, and it contained these words: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> spot {{about fifty}} {{yards from the}} Tower. It was the spot to which the woman whom he had met {{on the day of}} his arrival had pointed.|$|E
6000|$|... "What is this?" [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> little slide {{above the}} locks {{on which the}} word [...] "safe" [...] was {{engraved}} in gold letters.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Eden," [...] <b>she</b> asked, <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> large, blue, cow-like creature, with goat's {{horns and}} a hump, [...] "will {{you tell me}} what that animal is?" ...|$|R
60|$|Brangwen looked unwillingly. This was {{the voice}} of the serpent in his Eden. <b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> him <b>to</b> <b>a</b> plump, sly, {{malicious}} little face carved in stone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come here, Señora, and sit by me a little," [...] and <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{footstool}} at her side. [...] "When I {{have done}} this business I desire a few words with you." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> horseman, {{whom they}} had not before observed. He was {{descending}} the hill; but, as his steed seemed to have chosen his own pace, he made a very inconsiderable progress.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> long barn or {{boathouse}} almost {{upon the}} beach. Before the door two sentries were standing. Even {{from where they}} sat {{they could hear the}} faint whirr of a dynamo.|$|E
5000|$|In Raising Hope, Sherwood is {{indirectly}} mentioned {{during the}} opening scene of the second season as someone who [...] "started each day with a song that perfectly recapped what was going on". Then <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> empty chair with a Gilligan-type sailor cap on it. During the episode, the main character, Jimmy, loses his memory and his doctor advises him that unlike a sitcom, memory can't be regained by hitting someone on the head again and uses an episode of Gilligan's Island <b>to</b> illustrate the <b>point.</b>|$|R
40|$|The author, an {{obstetrician}} and gynecologist, {{relates the}} differences {{she has seen}} in birth delivery procedures between the time of giving birth to her first child in 1968 and her last, in 1991. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the increase in choices allowed to women in labor, such as use of analgesics or whether {{to go ahead with}} a caesarean or not, left <b>to</b> the woman. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the pressure on mother and child to leave the hospital after one day, or two at most. And <b>she</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> continuing need <b>to</b> have <b>a</b> doctor 2 ̆ 7 s advice in light of the choices...|$|R
6000|$|... "See," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{line about}} four {{inches from the}} top, [...] "the tree has been sawn in two length-ways and the lid laid on. Come, help." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know where, {{but as for}} how--look in that box," [...] and <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> little carved Eastern chest made of rose or sandal wood, {{that stood}} upon a table between us.|$|E
6000|$|She {{opened a}} large {{portfolio}} covered with green-veined black paper and yanked out a dozen unframed pastels and wash-drawings which she scornfully tossed on the bed, saying, as <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mass of Marseilles roofs: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed! That {{is a large}} subject, and not a very {{profitable}} one, I should say. Tell me, who is that?" [...] And <b>she</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lady who had stepped forward, a very splendid person, magnificently arrayed.|$|E
2500|$|Dogs Today editor Beverley Cuddy, {{who said}} in the {{programme}} that [...] "dogs are falling apart" [...] and [...] "the number of genetic problems are increasing at a frightening pace" [...] disputes the Kennel Club's 90% figure. <b>She</b> <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Kennel Club/British Small Animal Veterinary Association health survey, which shows that 37.4% of dogs {{had at least one}} serious health issue by age 5, and adds that the Kennel Club had to discount conditions such as hip dysplasia, slipping patellas and hereditary cataracts to get their 90% figure.|$|R
6000|$|In {{a minute}} or two, Miss Bowmore returned, with a {{newspaper}} in her hand. [...] "Read that," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> paragraph distinguished by a line drawn round it in ink.|$|R
6000|$|... "You can tie {{your horse}} under that tree over there," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>pointing</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> spot more trampled by hoofs {{than the old}} lady wished any other portion of her house-yard to be.|$|R
