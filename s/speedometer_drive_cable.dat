50|$|The {{potential}} of the Bowden cable and associated brake {{was not to be}} fully realised until the free-wheel sprocket became a standard feature of bicycles, over the period 1899-1901, and increasing numbers of applications were found for it, such as gear change mechanisms. Importantly in 1903, Hendee developed the twist-grip throttle using a similar cable for his 'Indian' motorcycles. Its lightness and flexibility recommended it to further automotive use such as clutch and <b>speedometer</b> <b>drive</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Other, usually older bicycle <b>speedometers</b> are <b>cable</b> <b>driven</b> {{from one}} or other wheel, as in the {{motorcycle}} speedometers described above. These do not require battery power, but can be relatively bulky and heavy, and may be less accurate. The turning force at the wheel may be provided either from a gearing system at the hub (making use {{of the presence of}} e.g. a hub brake, cylinder gear or dynamo) as per a typical motorcycle, or with a friction wheel device that pushes against {{the outer edge of the}} rim (same position as rim brakes, but on the opposite edge of the fork) or the sidewall of the tyre itself. The former type are quite reliable and low maintenance but need a gauge and hub gearing properly matched to the rim and tyre size, whereas the latter require little or no calibration for a moderately accurate readout (with standard tyres, the [...] "distance" [...] covered in each wheel rotation by a friction wheel set against the rim should scale fairly linearly with wheel size, almost as if it were rolling along the ground itself) but are unsuitable for off-road use, and must be kept properly tensioned and clean of road dirt to avoid slipping or jamming.|$|R

50|$|The <b>speedometer</b> <b>drive</b> {{mechanism}} operated {{from the}} rear wheel, with a long cable to the <b>speedometer.</b> This <b>drive</b> mechanism wore out very quickly, as did any replacement, leading to no speedometer reading (never resolved). The early tachometer drive jutted from {{the right side of}} the engine, and was vulnerable to being struck and snapped off (relocated to front of engine). The primary chain tensioning bolt tended to loosen at inconvenient times. The rear chain adjusting bolts pushed, rather than pulled, the rear axle, and would bend, making them difficult to turn. Nor were there index marks to allow equal axle positioning on the right and left side of the swing arm. The ignition switch mount would break from vibration (later relocated).|$|R

For the dynamic motion of a long-span Cable-Driven Parallel Robot (CDPR) system, a <b>driven</b> <b>cable</b> deployment and retrieval mathematical model of CDPR is developed by employing lumped mass method. The effects of cable mass are taken into account. The boundary condition of cable and initial values of equations is founded.

Using a hand-operated winch the source is then pushed out of the shield and along the source guide tube to the tip of the tube to expose the film, then cranked back into its fully shielded position.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Precise <b>cable</b> <b>drive</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} as an alternative transmission element to gearbox, belt and pulleys, chains and sprocket in Electro-Optical Tracking system. Precise <b>cable</b> <b>drive</b> has several significant advantages including backlash free, high stiffness, high efficiency, no lubrication etc. This paper develops analytical methods to predict the transverse oscillation frequency of precise <b>cable</b> <b>drive</b> to enable designers to better assess dynamic performance in the design study phase. Theoretical formulation of transverse oscillation equation for precise <b>cable</b> <b>drive</b> is carried out based on Hamilton’s principle taking into account flexural rigidity of cable. Furthermore, the transverse oscillation frequency is obtained from the transverse oscillation equation assuming small and linear vibration. Parametric studies are conducted to evaluate {{the relationship between the}} oscillation properties and <b>cable</b> <b>drive</b> parameters...|$|R

5000|$|Some {{areas of}} failure on this {{transmission}} include damage to plastic internals due to fluid over-temperature conditions, internal fluid pressure leaks from torn piston diaphragms, worn piston bores for solenoids in aluminum valve body, {{and the resulting}} worn clutches and bands. Occasionally, the plastic <b>speedometer</b> <b>drive</b> gear will break and fall off of the differential carrier and the speedometer will stop working. To repair this, the transmission must be removed and the differential disassembled far enough to replace the plastic gear. With age, the resistance in the wiring and/or electrical terminals between the valve body and transmission controller can increase. The additional resistance may prevent the computer from reading the faint pulses from the transmission speed sensors. Any missing sensor signal causes the transmission to go to [...] "fail safe" [...] or [...] "limp" [...] mode. This mode keeps the transmission in Third gear and the gear indicator in the instrument panel indicates all gears are selected simultaneously.|$|R
