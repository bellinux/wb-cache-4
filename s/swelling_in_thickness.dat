40|$|MDF {{panels of}} Eucalyptus grandis wood fibers {{were made in}} either {{experimentally}} in a laboratory or on an industrial production line. In order to analyze {{the influence of the}} production condition, the anatomical, physical and mechanical properties of the panels were determined. The wood refining induced the transversal rupture of the transversal fiber wall. The MDF panels obtained from the industrial production line presented less <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> <b>thickness</b> and absorption values and improved mechanical properties in the requirements of bending strength, module of elasticity and surface resistance. For laboratory MDF panels, it was possible to verify a statistically significant correlation between bending strength and module of elasticity, medium density and internal bond and <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> <b>thickness</b> and absorption. This tendency was also true for the MDF panels obtained in real conditions of production, however without statistical significance. By comparing the quality properties of MDF panels produced in the laboratory with those obtained in real conditions of production, it was sought to standardize the established variables for obtaining panels on a small scale, as well to make possible the safe transfer and divulgation of information obtained in the laboratory...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{conducted}} to determine and compare some physical and mechanical properties of different panels being used in furniture industry. For this aim, test samples from plastic-based new wood and wood-based particleboard and MDF panels are prepared according to TS EN 326 - 1. The bending strength and elongation in bending is measured according to TSE EN 310, screw withdrawal strength according to TS EN 320 and <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> <b>thickness</b> according to TS EN 317. As a result, the strength in bending was the highest in MDF (877. 0 N mm - 2) and the lowest in particle board (542. 8 N mm - 2). The elongation in bending was the highest in new wood (34. 01 mm) and the lowest in particle board (5. 65 mm). The screw withdrawal strength was the highest in MDF (822. 48 N mm - 2) and the lowest in new wood (632. 47 N mm - 2). <b>Swelling</b> <b>in</b> <b>thickness</b> due to water absorption was the highest in particle board (4. 44 mm) and the lowest in new wood (0. 02). According to these results, water absorption was the lowest but elongation in bending was the highest in new wood.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the physical and mechanical properties of particleboards formed of bamboo (Bambusa tuldoides) and pine (Pinus taeda) and combinations between them. To this end, panels were made, defined {{by the use of}} each type of particle (pure or mixed), being set 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 % of proportion to the dry weight, total of 36 panels. The physical tests performed were the moisture content, mass density observed, absorption of water and <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> <b>thickness</b> and the mechanics were static bending test, screw withdrawal test and internal bond. The results tested for simple correlation and regression analysis. In general, panels pure pine showed better results than just the panels formed by bamboo. The inclusion of bamboo decreases mainly the mechanical properties of panels. All panels were below the minimum standards for the physical and mechanical tests, only internal bond in panels of pine homogeneous had higher values than commercial standards...|$|E

30|$|Transverse {{swelling}} and its anisotropy in hinoki (Chamaecyparis obtusa) in {{several kinds of}} organic liquids and in water were investigated by means the replica method. There was more cross-sectional swelling of cell walls and cell wall <b>thickness</b> <b>in</b> earlywood than <b>in</b> latewood. Marked <b>swelling</b> toward cell lumens was observed in wood swollen in liquids that had higher swelling potentials than water. This suggests that the swelling of cell walls in these liquids {{is much greater than}} the external swelling. Feret's diameters of the cell lumens were reduced by <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> all the observed cases except in the tangential direction of earlywood, suggesting that cell walls swell to a much less extent in width than <b>in</b> <b>thickness.</b> Deformation of cell shapes caused by the tensile force from the latewood were observed in the earlywood and in the transitional region from earlywood to latewood. When swollen <b>in</b> water, transverse <b>swelling</b> anisotropy caused only by the <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> cell wall <b>thickness</b> were calculated to be 1.2 for the whole region over an annual ring and 1.4 for the earlywood. These values could not account for the external swelling anisotropy of 2.1. Considering obvious deformations of cell shapes in the earlywood and in the transitional region, we conclude that the interaction between earlywood and latewood is one of the prime factors contributing to the transverse swelling anisotropy of coniferous wood.|$|R
40|$|Membranes {{based on}} poly[2, 2 '-(p-oxydiphenylene) - 5, 5 '-bibenzimidazole] (OPBI) and their {{sulphonated}} derivatives (SOPBI) were prepared and first investigated for high temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells. OPBI and SOPBI membranes with good chemical stability were prepared by casting from their dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) solution and then impregnated in phosphoric acid baths to obtain H(3) PO(4) (PA) -doped membranes. The properties of PA-doped OPBI membranes, including phosphoric acid uptake, swelling ratio, mechanical properties and thermal properties, were fully investigated and compared with PA-doped SOPBI membranes. The fuel cell performances of PA-doped OPBI and SOPBI membranes at different temperatures were first evaluated. When doped in different concentrations of H(3) PO(4) solution, OPBI membranes adsorb more acid than SOPBI membranes. SOPBI membranes exhibit obviously lower <b>swelling</b> ratio <b>in</b> <b>thickness</b> direction {{than that of}} OPBI membranes. With an acid uptake of similar to 110 wt. %, corresponding doping level around 5, PA-doped OPBI and SOPBI membranes keep reasonably high tensile strength. PA-doped OPBI membranes exhibit peak power density of 0. 78 W cm(- 2) at 170 degrees C and 0. 25 MPa. With the same acid uptake, PA-doped SOPBI membranes displayed similar fuel cell performance to that of PA-doped OPBI membranes...|$|R
40|$|The {{utilization}} of eucalypts wood for MDF panels producing is recent in Brazil and presents larger perspective of increase, {{in relationship to}} pine wood, due to the shorter harvesting cycle and integral use of the bark in the productive process, etc,. The present work evaluated the anatomical structure and properties of MDF panels manufactured at laboratory with Eucalyptus grandis fibers obtained in three treatments. It were evaluated the variations in heating time, digester and refining pressure and specific energy. MDF panels obtained in critical refining condition showed darker fibers and cell walls transversely broken and lower resistance to internal bond, surface soundness, withdrawal of screws and <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> <b>thickness.</b> MDF panels obtained after less intensive refining condition showed better physical properties. Better refining conditions increase the bulk density and hinder the adhesive recover and fiber interlace, with worse physical and mechanics properties. Fiber morphology was evaluated through stereoscope and scanning electronic microscopic (SEM), establishing relationships between chips refining treatments and MDF panels properties...|$|E

40|$|The initial {{research}} {{describes a}} new type of fiber boards for the furniture interior design, developed in cooperation with ATB (Leibniz-Institute for Agricultural Engineering) by using a new method of raw materials preparation and specific production technologies of ATB. The main raw materials are aerobically aged hemp stalks. The samples are made of hemp chips with a long preservation time and fastened together with the UF glue. Specimens are 8 mm thick and correspond to a medium-density fiberboard, fitting standard EN 622. Due to the fact that non-veneered material can be used only in non-load-bearing constructions, material improving technologies were studied, such as increase of board density, increase of glue percentage, partially substitution of wet-preserved hemp chips with a dry hemp and/or wooden chips to equalize moisture content of obtained mixture. The particular article describes how the new material is veneered with the oak veneer obtaining three-ply composite board with the improved mechanical properties that allows to use these boards in a load-bearing constructions. Tests are performed with the veneered material to determine such parameters as static bending strength (MOR), modulus of elasticity in static bending (MOE), <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> <b>thickness</b> and hardness...|$|E

40|$|A new monomer 1, 5 -bis(4 -fluorobenzoyl) - 2, 6 -dimethoxynaphthalene (DMNF) was {{prepared}} and further polymerized to form naphthalene-based poly(arylene ether ketone) copolymers containing methoxy groups (MNPAEKs). The side-chain-type sulfortated naphthalene-based poly(arylene ether ketone) copolymers (SNPAEKs) {{were obtained by}} demethylation and sulfobutylation. Flexible and tough membranes with reasonably high mechanical strength were prepared. The SNPAEKs membrane showed anisotropic membrane swelling with larger <b>swelling</b> <b>in</b> <b>thickness</b> than in plane. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed clear nano-phase separated structure of SNPAEKs membranes, which composed of hydrophilic side chain and hydrophobic main-chain domains. Proton conductivities of copolymers increased gradually with increase in temperature. The highest conductivity of 0. 179 S/cm was obtained for SNPAEK- 80 (IEC = 1. 82 mequiv/g) at 80 degrees C, which is {{higher than that of}} Nafion 117 (0. 146 S/cm). The SNPAEKs membranes exhibit the methanol permeability in the range of 3. 42 x 10 (- 8) - 4. 49 x 10 (- 7) cm(2) /s, which are much lower than that of Nafion 117.
