5|$|Drainage of the Colorado Plateau was {{significantly}} altered by {{the opening of}} the Gulf of California. Rifting tore Baja California Peninsula northwestward from the Mexican mainland starting some 10 to 5mya. The ancestral Colorado River responded to the regional downwarping by taking a <b>shortcut</b> <b>to</b> the sea by flowing into the new gulf. This significantly decreased the distance from the river's headwaters and its delta at the sea. Water in the Colorado and its tributaries moved faster as a result and cut down deeper, creating the canyonland topography.|$|E
5|$|The path of SR 190 {{east of the}} Panamint Range in Death Valley National Park was {{followed}} in late 1849 and early 1850 by the Death Valley '49ers, a group of '49ers that had left the Old Spanish Trail at Enterprise, Utah {{to look for a}} <b>shortcut</b> <b>to</b> Walker Pass. The pioneers crossed the state line from Nevada near Ash Meadows, following the general route of present SR 190 from Death Valley Junction into Death Valley, which they left to the west into Panamint Valley and then turned south towards present State Route 178. After ore was discovered in Death Valley, the route became a primitive road, though most travel into the valley, such as the twenty-mule team borax route, was from the south.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} Native American groups {{inhabited}} {{the area from}} as early as 7000BC, most recently the Timbisha around 1000AD who migrated between winter camps in the valleys and summer grounds in the mountains. A group of European-Americans that became stuck in the valley in 1849 while looking for a <b>shortcut</b> <b>to</b> the gold fields of California gave the valley its name, even though only one of their group died there. Several short-lived boom towns sprang up during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to mine gold and silver. The only long-term profitable ore to be mined was borax, which was transported out of the valley with twenty-mule teams. The valley later {{became the subject of}} books, radio programs, television series, and movies. Tourism blossomed in the 1920s, when resorts were built around Stovepipe Wells and Furnace Creek. Death Valley National Monument was declared in 1933 and the park was substantially expanded and became a national park in 1994.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1960s, a limited-access {{toll road}} called the Garden State Thruway was planned along the US 9 {{alignment}} between Toms River and Woodbridge. This freeway {{was intended to}} serve all vehicles and provide a <b>shortcut</b> <b>to</b> the Garden State Parkway and US 9 through central New Jersey but was never built. In the early 1970s, another plan surfaced for a US 9 freeway from Route 34 in Madison Township (now Old Bridge Township) north to Route 35 in Sayreville. The freeway, which was to cost $17 million, was not built due to financial problems. A freeway was also proposed for US 9 in Atlantic County in the late 1960s, running from the proposed Route 60 freeway in Somers Point to CR 575 in Smithville. This freeway, which was to cost $35 million and intended to alleviate traffic on the current US 9 and the Garden State Parkway, was also never built due to financial and environmental issues.|$|E

25|$|Of note is {{that former}} Utah State Route 120 also {{connected}} Enterprise to SR-18, {{but instead of}} ending at the western city limits, it continued to the Nevada border via Terry's Ranch. This route was originally added in 1941 as a branch of SR-18 from Enterprise west to Nevada, where SR 75 continued as a <b>shortcut</b> <b>to</b> Panaca, but was split off as SR-120 in 1945. SR-120 was {{among a number of}} state highways deleted by the Utah State Legislature in 1969.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, songs vocalized in post-breeding season {{act as a}} cue to conspecific eavesdroppers. In black-throated blue warblers, males {{that have}} bred and {{reproduced}} successfully sing to their offspring to influence their vocal development, while males that have failed to reproduce usually abandon the nests and stay silent. The post-breeding song therefore inadvertently informs the unsuccessful males of particular habitats that have a higher likelihood of reproductive success. The social communication by vocalization provides a <b>shortcut</b> <b>to</b> locating high quality habitats and saves the trouble of directly assessing various vegetation structures.|$|E

25|$|Deng Ai pursued Jiang Wei to Yinping, {{where he}} formed {{a group of}} elite {{soldiers}} from among his troops and took a <b>shortcut</b> <b>to</b> Jiangyou (江由; north of present-day Jiangyou, Sichuan) through Handeyang Village (漢德陽亭; northwest of present-day Jiange County, Sichuan), and approached Mianzhu Pass (緜竹關; in present-day Mianzhu, Sichuan), which was near the Shu capital Chengdu. He asked Zhuge Xu to join him. Zhuge Xu had received orders to block Jiang Wei's advance and was not authorised to join Deng Ai in his mission, so he led his force to Baishui fort to rendezvous with Zhong Hui. Zhong Hui ordered Tian Zhang (田章) and others to lead a force to bypass the west of Jiange and approach Jiangyou. Along the way, they encountered three groups of Shu ambushers, defeated them and destroyed their camps. Deng Ai let Tian Zhang lead the vanguard and clear the path.|$|E
25|$|Ever {{since the}} {{colonization}} of America, the Northwest Passage {{had always been}} of special interest since it was speculated that it could offer a <b>shortcut</b> <b>to</b> Asia. Many attempts at crossing were made but very few succeeded due to the very unforgiving conditions that prevail in the Canadian Arctic {{for most of the}} year. The British explorer Sir John Franklin actually found a passage between 1845 and 1847 but this achievement was not known until years later as he and his crew had perished on the journey. Robert McClure was the first explorer to survive the expedition in 1850 but he completed the journey on a sled. It is only in 1906 that the passage was navigated entirely on water by the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. However, construction of the Panama Canal had already begun at that time and its completion in 1914 lessened the need for this route.|$|E
25|$|After {{collecting}} Ewan's {{body and}} taking it to his fisherman's hut, Dan goes to confess to Mona. She cannot hold {{the murder of her}} brother against him, because she loves him. She tells Dan that he must hand himself to make atonement for his crime. However, upon returning to the hut, he finds that the crew of his fishing boat have found the body there. In shock he allows himself to be taken with them as they take the body out to sea to dispose of it. However, when they throw the body into the sea, it miraculously escapes its weighted sheet floats back to shore. This Dan takes as a sign of God's will and so he steers the ship back to shore. But, once on land and taking a <b>shortcut</b> <b>to</b> the Deemster's house to hand himself in, Dan falls down a mineshaft, from which he is unable to escape until the next morning.|$|E

25|$|On 2 August, Chikatilo {{killed a}} 16-year-old girl, Natalya Golosovskaya, in Aviators' Park. On 7 August, he lured a 17-year-old girl, Lyudmila Alekseyeva, {{to the banks}} of the Don River on the pretense of showing her a <b>shortcut</b> <b>to</b> a bus terminal. Alekseyeva {{suffered}} 39 slash wounds to her body before Chikatilo mutilated and disemboweled her: intentionally inflicting wounds he knew would not be immediately fatal. Her body was found in the following morning, her excised upper lip inside her mouth. Hours after Alekseyeva's murder, Chikatilo flew to the Uzbekistan capital of Tashkent on a business trip. By the time he had returned to Rostov on 15 August, he had killed an unidentified young woman and a 10-year-old girl. Within two weeks an 11-year-old boy had been found strangled and castrated, with his eyes gouged out, in Rostov before a young librarian, Irina Luchinskaya, was killed in Aviators' Park on 6 September.|$|E
25|$|The first {{bridge was}} {{probably}} a Roman military pontoon type, giving a rapid overland <b>shortcut</b> <b>to</b> Camulodunum from the southern and Kentish ports, along the Roman roads of Stane Street and Watling Street (now the A2). Around 55 AD, the temporary bridge over the Thames {{was replaced by a}} permanent timber piled bridge, maintained and guarded by a small garrison. On the relatively high, dry ground at the northern end of the bridge, a small, opportunistic trading and shipping settlement took root, and grew into the town of Londinium. A smaller settlement developed {{at the southern end of}} the bridge, in the area now known as Southwark. The bridge was probably destroyed along with the town in the Boudican revolt (60 AD), but both were rebuilt and Londinium became the administrative and mercantile capital of Roman Britain. The upstream fords and ferries remained in use but the bridge offered uninterrupted, mass movement of foot, horse, and wheeled traffic across the Thames, linking four major arterial road systems north of the Thames with four to the south. Just downstream of the bridge were substantial quays and depots, convenient to seagoing trade between Britain and the rest of the Roman Empire.|$|E
