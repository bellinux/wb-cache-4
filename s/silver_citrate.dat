To {{prepare the}} {{nano-scale}} silver carboxylate emulsions and investigate their {{applications in the}} preparation of nano-scale silver films, the <b>silver</b> <b>citrate</b> emulsion was synthesized through the reaction of silver nitrate with sodium citrate in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a surface modification agent in water. The emulsion was coated onto the surface of the PET substrate to form a thin latex layer of <b>silver</b> <b>citrate.</b> And this was followed by drying at about 100 °C. Then, the <b>silver</b> <b>citrate</b> thin film was deoxidized by aqueous ascorbic acid. Finally, a translucent silver thin film was formed {{on the surface of the}} PET substrate. Properties of the <b>silver</b> <b>citrate</b> emulsion and the silver film on the PET were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), laser particle size analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetry(TG),UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy(AFM) and digital multimeter analysis. It was found that the <b>silver</b> <b>citrate</b> particle surface-modified by PVP has a nano-rod structure and homogeneous size distribution. The nano-rod was about 20 nm in diameter and 200 nm in length. For the UV-visible absorption spectrum of the thin film exhibited an absorption peak at 430 nm, the silver thin film prepared on the surface of the PET substrate was a typical nano-scale sliver film. Measurements of the sliver thin film at room temperature indicated that the silver film was electrically conductive, and the surface resistance was 2. 42 kΩ/cm...|$|E
40|$|Formation {{of silver}} citrate/citric acid {{complexed}} solutions was investigated. Although, <b>silver</b> <b>citrate</b> is minimally soluble in water, it can successfully be dissolved in citric acid solutions. The maximum concentration of Ag(I) in solution {{is estimated at}} 23 to 25 [*]g/L if the concentration of citric acid is at least 4 [*]mol/L or higher. The dissolution of <b>silver</b> <b>citrate</b> in citric acid solutions was attributed {{to the formation of}} <b>silver</b> <b>citrate</b> complexes of a general formula [Ag 3 (C 6 H 5 O 7) n+ 1] 3 n−. The silver citrate/citric acid solutions, containing more than about 13 [*]g/L Ag+ ion, have exhibited a decrease in Ag(I) concentration in solution over time, due to crystallization. The crystallization product was attributed to the formation of [Ag 3 C 6 H 5 O 7]x⋅nH 2 O.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} for {{the first}} time the intrinsic role of nanoconfinement in facilitating the chemical reduction of metal ion precursors with a suitable reductant for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles, when the identical reaction does not occur in bulk solution. Taking the case of citrate reduction of silver ions under the unusual condition of [citrate]/[Ag+] >> 1, it has been observed that the <b>silver</b> <b>citrate</b> complex, stable in bulk solution, decomposes readily in confined nanodomains of charged and neutral matrices (ion-exchange film and porous polystyrene beads), leading to the formation of silver nanoparticles. The evolution of growth of silver nanoparticles in the ion-exchange films has been studied using a combination of Ag- 110 m radiotracer, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It has been observed that the nanoconfined redox decomposition of <b>silver</b> <b>citrate</b> complex is responsible for the formation of Ag seeds, which thereafter catalyze oxidation of citrate and act as electron sink for subsequent reduction of silver ions. Because of these parallel processes, the particle sizes are in the bimodal distribution at some stages of the reaction. A continuous seeding with parallel growth mechanism has been revealed. Based on the SAXS data and radiotracer kinetics, the growth mechanism has been elucidated as a combination of continuous autoreduction of silver ions on the nanoparticle surfaces and a sudden coalescence of nanoparticles at a critical number density. However, for a fixed period of reduction, the size, size distribution, and number density of thus-formed Ag nanoparticles have been found to be dependent on physical architecture and chemical composition of the matrix...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to: evaluate the efficacy of different cleaning cloth types and cloth-disinfectant combinations in reducing food contact surface contamination to acceptable levels; determine the optimum moist heat and moist heat + sanitizer treatments that can significantly reduce the number of Listeria strains on deli slicer components; and investigate if the moist heat treatment used in this study induced the viable-but-non-culturable (VBNC) state in Listeria cells. The efficacy of wiping cloths was measured using ATP-bioluminescence and total plate count methods using four different wiping cloths and <b>silver</b> dihydrogen <b>citrate</b> sanitizer on food contact surfaces. The lethality study of moist heat and <b>silver</b> dihydrogen <b>citrate</b> disinfectant against Listeria strains was done using deli slicer components and the viable-but-non-culturable state of Listeria strains subjected to sub-lethal moist heat and <b>silver</b> dihydrogen <b>citrate</b> disinfectant stresses was measured using BacLight bacterial viability test kit. In the first study we demonstrated that the cleaning effects of wiping cloths on food contact surfaces can be enhanced when used with the SDC sanitizer and stated that the ATP-B measurements can be used for real-time hygiene monitoring in the public sector with inclusion of microbial contamination testing (total plate count) for more reliable measure of cleanliness. In the moist heat lethality study, the internal moist heat only treatment and both the internal and external moist heat + disinfectant treatments yielded non-detectable levels of Listeria strains on stainless steel and cast aluminum coupons. Moist heat only and moist heat + disinfectant treatments at 150 °F (66 °C) and at least 20 % relative humidity (RH) for 5 h was adequate to attain non-detectable levels of a Listeria strains cocktail on both stainless steel and cast aluminum deli meat slicer components. The BacLight bacterial viability test demonstrated that the moist heat treatment applied in this study was effective in inactivating Listeria strains. However, the absence of growth on nutrient agar plates and detection of live cells by the viability test demonstrated that the sub-lethal temperature used in this study could induce the VBNC state in Listeria strains...|$|R
5000|$|An early, {{and very}} common, method for synthesizing <b>silver</b> {{nanoparticles}} is <b>citrate</b> reduction. This method was first recorded by M. C. Lea, who successfully produced a citrate-stabilized silver colloid in 1889. [...] Citrate reduction involves {{the reduction of}} a silver source particle, usually AgNO3 or AgClO4, to colloidal <b>silver</b> using trisodium <b>citrate,</b> Na3C6H5O7. The synthesis is usually performed at an elevated temperature (~100 °C) to maximize the monodispersity (uniformity in both size and shape) of the particle. In this method, the citrate ion traditionally acts as both the reducing agent and the capping ligand, making it a useful process for AgNP production due to its relative ease and short reaction time. However, the silver particles formed may exhibit broad size distributions and form several different particle geometries simultaneously. [...] The addition of stronger reducing agents to the reaction {{is often used to}} synthesize particles of a more uniform size and shape.|$|R

Many {{studies have shown that}} after the silver ions are reduced to silver atoms, they will further agglomerate into oligomeric clusters, leading into the formation of silver nanoparticles. Normally, to produce silver nanoparticles, the most frequently used precursors for chemical reduction are silver nitrate [25 – 28], silver acetate [29, 30], <b>silver</b> <b>citrate</b> [30 – 32], and silver chlorate [30, 31, 33]. Among various reducing agents, the most commonly used reductants are borohydride, citrate, ascorbate, and compounds with hydroxyl or carboxyl groups such as alcohol, aldehydes, carbohydrates, and their derivatives [34 – 37].|$|E

40|$|Morphological {{state of}} {{embryonic}} liver {{under the influence}} of silver and gold citrates on a background of lead intoxication was studied. We found that values of the hepatofetal index in the groups Pb+Ag and Pb+Au had significant differences as compared to the group exposed to lead intoxication, but did not differ significantly from the control group and made up 0, 086 ± 0, 001 and 0, 083 ± 0, 001, respectively. Value of the relative area of blood vessels in groups Pb+Ag and Pb+Au was 13. 08 ± 0. 53 % and 16. 83 ± 0. 53 %, respectively, which had no significant difference as compared to control group, but differed from the value of lead intoxication group. Under the influence of <b>silver</b> <b>citrate</b> on a background of lead intoxication the relative area of hematopoietic cells was 52, 5 ± 0, 95 %; this indicates to modification action of silver on haematopoiesis. Thus, injection of silver and gold citrates prevents negative effect of lead on morphometric parameters of embryonic liver, relative area of blood vessels and hematopoietic cells.

50|$|Silver has {{antimicrobial}} properties, but compounds {{suitable for}} disinfection are usually unstable {{and have a}} limited shelf-life. <b>Silver</b> dihydrogen <b>citrate</b> (SDC) is a chelated form of silver that maintains its stability. SDC kills microorganisms by two modes of action: 1) the silver ion deactivates structural and metabolic membrane proteins, leading to microbial death; 2) the microbes view SDC as a food source, allowing the silver ion to enter the microbe. Once inside the organism, the silver ion denatures the DNA, which halts the microbe's ability to replicate, leading to its death. This dual action makes SDC highly and quickly effective against {{a broad spectrum of}} microbes. SDC is non-toxic, non-caustic, colorless, odorless, and tasteless, and does not produce toxic fumes. SDC is non-toxic to humans and animals: the United States Environmental Protection Agency classifies it into the lowest toxicity category for disinfectants, category IV.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe in vivo {{toxicity}} to eukaryotes of nanosilver (AgNP) spheres {{and plates}} in two sizes each {{was assessed using}} the simple model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. For each shape, smaller AgNP size correlated with higher toxicity, as indicated by reduced larval growth. Smaller size also correlated with significant increases in silver uptake for <b>silver</b> nanospheres. <b>Citrate</b> coated <b>silver</b> spheres of 20 nm diameter induced an innate immune response that increased or held steady over 24 h, while regulation of genes involved in metal metabolism peaked at 4 h and subsequently decreased. For AgNP spheres, coating altered bioactivity, with a toxicity ranking of polyethylene glycol (PEG) > polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) ≅ branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI) > <b>citrate,</b> but <b>silver</b> uptake ranking of PEG > PVP > citrate > BPEI.

40|$|Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) {{can be used}} {{to detect}} {{specific}} DNA sequences by methods based on hybridisation of oligonucleotide functionalized nanoparticles to complementary DNA sequences. The problem, which has to be overcome to use this technique is that DNA is not strongly SERS active. This is {{due to the lack of}} a visible chromophore and presence of the highly negatively charged phosphate backbone, which prevents the electrostatic interaction with the metal surface necessary for the enhancement. To obtain SERS active DNA a label containing a surface seeking group, to allow adsorption of DNA on a metal surface, and a chromophore has to be attached to the DNA strand. Here we report the synthesis of three linkers containing a Raman tag [the following fluorophores were used for this purpose due to the fluorescence quenching ability of metallic nanoparticles: fluorescein, 6 -aminofluorescein and tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) ], surface complexing group (cyclic disulphide thioctic acid) and a chemical functionality for attachment of DNA (carboxyl group). Each of the linkers also contain poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) (3 mer), which reduces non-specific adsorption of molecules to the surface of the nanoparticles and provides colloidal stability. The synthesized linkers were used to functionalize gold citrate (18 and 50 nm), <b>silver</b> <b>citrate</b> (40 nm) and silver EDTA (35 nm) nanoparticles. All of the conjugates exhibit high stability, gave good SERS responses at laser excitation frequencies of 514 and 633 nm and could be conjugated to amino-modified oligonucleotides in the presence of the commonly used (N-(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) -N'-ethyl carbodiimide hydrochloride-EDC center dot HCl with N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide or 4 -(4, 6 -dimethoxy- 1, 3, 5 -triazin- 2 -yl) - 4 -methylmorpholinium chloride-DMT MM, which has not been used for bioconjugate preparation previously. This approach is less time consuming and less expensive than previously used protocols and does not require the formation of a mixed layer of oligonucleotides and Raman reporter on the metal surface. Additionally the presence of a reactive functionality within the linker structure makes it possible to conjugate the linker to other biomolecules of interest such as proteins...|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} nanotoxicology {{has emerged as}} a {{discipline}} in parallel with the rapid expansion of nanotechnology and the use of nanomaterials in modern life. Assessing the potential impacts of manufactured nanoparticles (MNPs) on the environment and human health is critical to the sustainable development of the nano-industry. Current knowledge on the ecological implications of nanotoxicology has major uncertainties surrounding the fate and behaviour of nanomaterials in the exposure environment. Bioavailability, uptake and partitioning of nanomaterials to organisms are key determinates to toxicity, yet these foundations of basic data are only now just starting to emerge in any useful and coherent manner for aquatic animals. This thesis work set out to address this gap in knowledge and further our understanding of these important principles for fish. In an attempt to develop a high through-put screening system for toxicity of MNPs, studies assessing the utility of primary isolated rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) hepatocytes found they showed very limited responses to a range of MNPs. There was a lack of any evidence for either lipid peroxidation or xenobiotic detoxification activity. In these studies isolated trout hepatocytes were found to be unresponsive to the induction of these biological responses after exposure to positive controls. The findings demonstrated that the MNPs tested showed low toxicity generally and that fish hepatocytes do not provide a useful system for the screening of potential toxic effects of MNPs. In this cell culture work, coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy was applied to demonstrate that the particles supplied in the culture medium did cross the cell membrane and enter into the exposed cells. In {{the second phase of the}} work in this thesis CARS was investigated as an experimental technique for tracing a wide range of metal and metal oxide MNPs into cells and tissues. CARS was applied to evaluate initial detection of different MNPs and investigate the imaging capability on a range of cells, tissues and organisms. Finally, CARS was applied to assess localisation ability of MNPs within biological matrices. MNPs were shown to be taken into trout hepatocytes using a 3 D reconstruction to determine the origin of the MNP signal within the cell. Uptake of MNPs was established into trout gill and kidney tissue, corophium and daphnia species and were shown to have different partitioning in zebrafish embryos. In summary CARS showed great potential for tracing particle uptake and bio-distribution both in vitro and in vivo. Particular benefits include imaging MNPs in living organisms, without the need for labelling or fixing the material. Limitations of the CARS technique are also discussed. In chapter 4, the consequences of the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) were investigated on the uptake of MNPs into fish. Carp (Cyprinus carpio) were exposed to cerium dioxide (CeO 2) MNPs in combination with NOM over 28 days. Elevated levels of uptake of cerium were measured in the brain, gill and kidney tissue by induction coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) for fish exposed to 50 Î¼g/l CeO 2 MNPs in combination with 250 Î¼g/l of NOM. There were no such effects of the NOM enhancing uptake for the bulk CeO 2 particles. Detailed studies on the behaviour of the CeO 2 MNPs in the exposure medium demonstrated the highly complex and dynamic nature of the interactions with NOM. This study discusses some of the difficulties in the techniques, analysis and interpretation of data derived from studies of this nature. The finding that NOM may enhance MNP uptake presents a potential issue for current risk assessment criteria for MNPs that do not consider natural conditions. The final experimental chapter considered maternal transfer as a potentially important route for exposure of embryos and early life stage animals to MNPs in live bearing animals. In this work guppies (Poecilia reticulata) were exposed to 7 nm <b>silver</b> <b>citrate</b> stabilised particles and citrate stabilised bulk sized particles, dosed via the diet for a full gestation cycle. Maternal transfer of Ag to the larvae was significantly higher for the nanoparticulate treatment compared with the bulk and control treatments and larval burden was significantly higher compared with the maternal sires. However, there was no impact of Ag on larval survival, birth weights, or on indices of body condition in the exposed adults. The enhanced uptake of nano Ag compared to bulk Ag particles into the guppy offspring emphasises the potential for exposure to sensitive early life stages of organisms, which to date has not been widely considered and suggests greater research is needed in this area. Collectively, the studies conducted in this thesis contribute to the science base of nanotoxicology, specifically in areas where data are especially lacking and with a focus on bioavailability. These studies have identified that fish hepatocytes do not offer an effective screen for MNPs, and the data produced further suggests that the MNPs tested are not toxic in that form. Working with CARS I have helped advance the understanding on its utility for nanotoxicology studies, with regards to its application and limitation for uptake analyses. The study of MNPs in combination with NOM has identified the fundamental change that real life exposure scenarios may instigate for toxicity assessments of MNPs, with significant impact on risk assessment criteria. Finally, Iâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 ve established that maternal transfer is an exposure route for MNPs that requires further study, with evidence of transfer to sensitive life stages in a non-mammalian system.

Controlled electrolyte addition can lower the repulsion to a value 0 < V-max < 15 k(B) T leading to a solution which is enriched in small aggregates but does not show complete, uncontrolled aggregation.

40|$|Tesis {{doctoral}} inédita leída en la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Faultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Química Física Aplicada. Fecha de lectura: 22 - 10 - 2014 Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} powerful analytical techniques for detection of trace amount of chemicals. It is due to the coupling of the Raman scattering of a molecular system to a localized plasmon resonance of silver or gold nanostructures. However, many molecules of great interest lack affinity for metal surfaces and their SERS detection is not possible. On the other hand, the affinity of an analyte towards metal surface can be increased by modifying or functionalizing the surface with the organic molecules. In this thesis we have used linkers, aliphatic dithiols, to functionalize silver and gold nanoparticles for the SERS detection of low concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (aldrin, α-endosulfan, lindane and dieldrin). Using various types of metal colloids and aliphatic α,ω-dithiols as bifunctional linkers it was found that the most suitable substrate for SERS detection of these pesticides are <b>citrate</b> <b>silver</b> colloid nanoparticles covered by 1, 8 -octanedithiol (10 - 5 M). It should be also noted that functionalization of the metal surface by aromatic dithiols does not lead to a SERS substrate suitable for the detection of the pesticides. Furthermore, the fingerprint region (300 – 400 cm- 1) for the SERS detection of the pesticides was determined. The studied pesticides follow a Langmuir adsorption model from which the adsorption constant and the limit of detection for individual pesticides were determined. The obtained results confirm the high sensitivity of SERS for the detection of low quantities (~ 10 - 8 M) of organochlorine pesticides which provide solid basis for the construction of suitable nano-sensors for the identification and quantitative analysis of this type of chemicals. Moreover, the adsorption mechanism of aromatic and linear aliphatic α,ω-dithiols on silver and gold nanoparticles has been studied in this thesis by UV-VIS absorption spectroscopy, SERS and transmission electron microscopy. All these experimental techniques were employed to obtain information about the adsorption and coordination mechanism, the orientation, conformational order, and packing of the dithiols on the metal nanoparticle surface...|$|R
30|$|The {{synthesis}} of metal nanoparticles with high uniformity attracts considerable attentions {{due to their}} fantastic optical properties arising from localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) [1 – 3]. Such plasmonic nanoparticles, especially silver, are widely used in catalysis [4, 5], biological and chemical sensors [6 – 8], and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy [9 – 11]. It has been recognized that the optical spectral signatures of plasmonic nanoparticles are primarily dependent on their shapes [12 – 14]. Leading works in the {{synthesis of}} silver nanoparticles {{have focused on the}} shape control of silver nanocrystals via various routes. Wiley et al. [15] controlled the shapes of silver nanocrystals by varying reaction conditions such as the precursor concentration, molar ratio of the surfactant, and silver ions. As well known, the final structure of the nanocrystals are mainly determined by the crystallinity of seeds produced in the early stage of the reaction. Xia's group prepared silver pentagonal nanowires, nanocubes, and bipyramids from multiply twinned decahedral seeds, single-crystalline seeds, and single-twinned seeds, respectively [16]. As for the crystals' control of seeds, Xia et al. introduced Cl- or Br- as etchants combined with oxygen to avoid the formation of undesired seeds [17]. Another factor that influences the shape uniformity of the nanocrystals is self-nucleation in the reaction process. Self-nucleation of reductive silver atoms usually blocks the seed growth process resulting in the formation of spherical by-productions. The solution to the problem is to decrease the reduction rate of silver ions. Zhang et al. [18] applied a weak reductant to control the reduction rate. Meantime, citrate ligands used can also decrease the reduction rate because of complexation between <b>silver</b> ions and <b>citrate</b> ligands. Using polyol reduction method in the presence of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), Sun and co-workers successfully prepared silver nanowires [19 – 22]. Alternatively, the addition of as-prepared seeds [19] in the initial growth step has been suggested to induce the formation of nanowires preferentially. However, these reaction processes are usually complex or difficult to control. Without fine control of reactant concentrations and growth process, the obtained silver nanowires are always in low yield accompanied by large amounts of by-products such as nanocubes or nanospheres growing from isotropic seeds. In these cases, the post processing, such as low rotation-rate centrifugation [20] or special separation technique [23] to purify nanowires, is usually indispensable. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a reliable and facile method for the synthesis of silver nanocrystals in high yield with uniform size.|$|R
