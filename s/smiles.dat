40|$|Introduction: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to define age-related changes in the human <b>smile.</b> The areas of interest were: upper lip length at <b>smile</b> and repose, upper lip thickness at <b>smile</b> and repose, maxillary incisal display at <b>smile,</b> interlabial gap height at <b>smile,</b> <b>smile</b> index, percent buccal corridors, intercommissural width at rest, <b>smile</b> height, and <b>smile</b> arc. A secondary objective was to study the perioral changes from rest to <b>smile</b> and compare them on the basis of age. Materials and Method: Video equipment was used to capture video for 261 subjects. Two frames for each subject were selected; one frame representing the lips and rest and the second representing the widest <b>smile.</b> After excluding 40 subjects the data for the remaining 221 subjects was analyzed. Results: There was a decrease of 1. 5 to 2 mm in the maxillary incisor display during <b>smile,</b> with increase in age. <b>Smile</b> index significantly increased with increase in age.

40|$|<b>SMILE</b> (small {{heterodimer}} partner interacting {{leucine zipper}} protein) {{has been identified}} as a coregulator in ER signaling. In this study, we have examined the effects of <b>SMILE</b> on other NRs (nuclear receptors). <b>SMILE</b> inhibits GR, CAR and HNF 4 α-mediated transactivation. Knockdown of <b>SMILE</b> gene expression increases the transactivation of the NRs. <b>SMILE</b> interacts with GR, CAR and HNF 4 α in vitro and in vivo. <b>SMILE</b> and these NRs colocalize in the nucleus. <b>SMILE</b> binds to the ligand-binding domain or AF 2 domain of the NRs. Competitions between <b>SMILE</b> and the coactivators GRIP 1 or PGC- 1 α have been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, an intrinsic repressive activity of <b>SMILE</b> is observed in Gal 4 -fusion system, and the intrinsic repressive domain is mapped to the C-terminus of <b>SMILE,</b> spanning residues 203 – 354. Moreover, <b>SMILE</b> interacts with specific HDACs (histone deacetylases) and SMILE-mediated repression is released by HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A, in a NR-specific manner. Finally, ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays reveal that <b>SMILE</b> associates with the NRs on the target gene promoters. Adenoviral overexpression of <b>SMILE</b> represses GR-, CAR- and HNF 4 α-mediated target gene expression. Overall, these results suggest that <b>SMILE</b> functions as a novel corepressor of NRs via competition with coactivators and the recruitment of HDACs...|$|R
