5|$|In the 1980s, the {{stations}} on the Sognsvann Line were rebuilt. The platforms were lengthened from fitting two-car to fitting four-car trains and the platform height was increased. The third rail {{made it impossible}} to cross the line at-grade; an underpass was therefore constructed at Berg station. The station was also redesigned in concrete with <b>steel</b> <b>columns</b> and wooden sheds designed by architect Arne Henriksen.|$|E
5|$|A full upgrade of {{the station}} {{was carried out in}} 1987. A main {{incentive}} was that the Norwegian Public Roads Administration wanted the station building removed to make room for a new interchange towards Jar. Therefore, Kielland's station building was demolished in 1987. The new station building, designed by NSB Arkitektkontor and Arne Henriksen, was built in glass and concrete with a dominant portal presenting the staircases. On the island platform a new ticket booth was built in steel and glass. The platform was covered by a roof of laminated wood and plywood held up by galvanized <b>steel</b> <b>columns.</b> The roof followed the shape of the curved platform and featured a gable.|$|E
5|$|Frøen Station was rebuilt so {{only the}} trains on the Holmenkollen Line would stop there, while Nordberg Station was closed. All the stations, except Ullevål stadion, {{were built in}} the same {{architectural}} style. They are constructed in concrete with <b>steel</b> <b>columns</b> and wooden sheds and fences. All platforms have a shed; Ullevål stadion has a larger weather cover and has a design inspired by football. The upgrade also included the installation of third-rail from Majorstuen to Stortinget in the Common Tunnel. From 10 January 1993, the Sognsvann Line re-open, and from 4 April, the line started operating through the Common Tunnel and connected to the Lambertseter Line. The new service became operated with T1000 rolling stock.|$|E

5|$|The Forth Estuary Transport Authority (FETA) {{justified}} the {{continued use of}} tolls by suggesting they were necessary to fund maintenance and improvement works. These included the construction of defences around the submerged piers forming the bases of the main towers {{in the event of}} collision in the Firth. The main towers were also strengthened with internal <b>steel</b> <b>columns</b> (the original tower structure was hollow) and had hydraulic rams jack up these sections to transfer a portion of the load to the new steelwork. Also, the vertical cables suspending the deck had their bolts replaced after a detected failure. A new paint system required development for the bridge (the original was phased out due to environmental concerns).|$|E
5|$|The faux {{finished}} {{interior of}} the church incorporates groined vaults in the Gothic architecture style permitting very ample illumination from lateral windows. The <b>steel</b> <b>columns,</b> walls and ceiling were painted by Lorenzo Rocha, Isabelo Tampingco and Félix Martínez to {{give the appearance of}} marble and jasper. Trompe l'oeil paintings of saints and martyrs by Rocha were used to decorate the interiors of the church. True to the Gothic revival spirit of the church are its confessionals, pulpit, altars and five retablos designed by Lorenzo Guerrero and Rocha. The sculptor Eusebio Garcia carved the statues of holy men and women. Six holy water fonts were constructed for the church, each crafted from marble obtained from Romblon.|$|E

25|$|Two {{traditional}} topping out ceremonies {{took place}} on the building on 11 April 2008. In the first ceremony, executives from Ballymore and KPMG placed a yew sapling on the building's 11th floor in a ceremony that is thought to date back to the Viking times. The yew is said to be able to ward off evil spirits. However, the yew was placed in concrete and was not expected to survive. Later, Mike Whitby, the head of Birmingham City Council, screwed a golden bolt into place in one of the building's <b>steel</b> <b>columns.</b>|$|E

A continuous circulating bi-cable aerial ropeway system, where the track cable acts as a rail {{in the sky and}} the haul cable pulls the cabins, allows long spans between towers. It is the first of its type to be installed in Hong Kong. Martin Leitner, chief sales officer of Leitner, explained that the cable car system used in Hong Kong is much heavier and bigger than that used in Austria. He said the <b>steel</b> <b>columns</b> used to support the system have to be stronger, and thus more expensive.|$|E
25|$|After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, the {{building}} suffered from major structural damage {{and was immediately}} closed down. Instead of tearing it down {{and replacing it with}} a newer building, city leaders decided to retrofit it seismically. To do so, <b>steel</b> <b>columns</b> in the foundation were cut and they were replaced by rubber bearings. Steel beams were added to support the steel structure and concrete walls were added to support existing walls. The building can now move laterally 18-20inches in an earthquake. The city hall was repaired along with the downtown revitalization project of building new office buildings. The repair project cost $85 million.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{nonlinear}} {{analytical approach}} {{for evaluating the}} inelastic buckling and residual strength of column member is presented in this study. A <b>steel</b> <b>column</b> member subjected to an axial compression load will shorten {{in the direction of}} load. If the load increased until the column buckles, the shortening will stop and the column will suddenly bend or deform laterally and may at the same time twist in a direction perpendicular to its longitudinal axis. However; before final buckling or collapse, <b>steel</b> <b>column</b> member has a tendency of plastic deformation. The issue has been much discussed along with the evaluation of plastic deformation capacity and restoring force of column members in the large deformation range following inelastic post-buckling. In order to predict the inelastic buckling behavior of the member, the load-deformation relationship needs to be identified in the whole process. To verify the accuracy of the nonlinear finite element analysis, compression test on an H-shaped <b>steel</b> <b>column</b> member was carried out and both inelastic deformation and the relationship between load-displacement curves were compared...|$|R
40|$|<b>Steel</b> <b>column</b> {{base plates}} are {{integral}} parts in steel structures. They {{are widely used}} in foundations of various types of structures such as building frames, bridges, transmission towers, light poles and road signs. They spread column forces over a larger contact area and transfer forces to anchor bolts and cementitious grout beneath them. However, gradual thinning of base plates due to corrosion damage reduces their load bearing capacity and subsequently jeopardises the structural integrity of the entire structure. This paper presents a remaining capacity assessment method for <b>steel</b> <b>column</b> bases derived analytically based on a time-dependent corrosion rate model and the yield-line theory. Time dependent moment capacity of base plates is derived analytically {{as a function of}} time and geometric parameters of the plate. Solution to a wide-flange-section-to-column-base plate connection subjected to major axis bending moment is presented. Results of the analytical expression are compared to a three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model and good agreement is obtained. The proposed model may contribute to the prediction of remaining strength and repair schedule of corroded <b>steel</b> <b>column</b> bases...|$|R

25|$|On 11 June, it was {{discovered}} that the water level in the spent fuel pool was only one third of normal, and only part of the fuel rods were covered with water. This was probably the cause of the high radiation levels measured. This pool has also been used to dump equipment. On Sunday 19 June, the pool was refilled, to minimize the radiation and making it possible to work again at this place. On 21 June, the first stage of strengthening at the second floor in the building under the pool was finished: 32 <b>steel</b> <b>columns</b> 8 meters long with a weight of 40 tons each were placed at the second floor.

25|$|On September 13, 2001, Zdeněk Bažant, {{professor}} of civil engineering and materials science at Northwestern University, circulated a draft paper with {{results of a}} simple analysis of the World Trade Center collapse.

Once {{more than half of}} the columns on a particular floor buckled, the overhead structure could no longer be supported and complete collapse of the structures occurred. Bažant later published an expanded version of this analysis. Other analyses were conducted by MIT civil engineers Oral Buyukozturk and Franz-Josef Ulm, who also described a collapse mechanism on September 21, 2001.

25|$|Once the <b>steel</b> <b>columns</b> were erected for the {{basement}} car park, the steelwork to the suspended ground floor was installed. Barrett then erected the 11 storey frame above this concrete base. Below the slab, Barrett Steel Buildings {{had already left}} studs on the columns which allowed Kier to erect the RC basement beams later on. For the steel frame, Barrett split the project into halves and erected three floors on one side before moving over to the other. This allowed the decking to be laid on the first side {{as well as the}} concrete floors. The programming meant Barrett was always erecting steelwork at least two levels ahead of the concreting team.

40|$|Summary]: This paper {{studies the}} {{ultimate}} {{strength and ductility}} of short concrete-filled thin-walled <b>steel</b> box <b>columns</b> with local buckling effects using a nonlinear fiber element analysis technique. New effective width formulas for determining the ultimate strengths of steel plates with geometric imperfections and residual stresses in concrete-filled thin-walled <b>steel</b> box <b>columns</b> are incorporated in the fiber element analysis program {{to account for the}} effects of local buckling. The progressive local and post-local buckling is simulated by gradually redistributing the normal stresses within the steel box. Performance indices are employed to quantitatively evaluate the section and ductility performance of composite columns. The effects of local buckling, steel ratios and steel yield strengths on the strength and ductility of concrete-filled <b>steel</b> box <b>columns</b> are investigated. It is demonstrated that local buckling significantly reduces the ultimate strength of thin-walled high-strength <b>steel</b> box <b>columns</b> filled with concrete. The 4 % limit on the steel ratio or the 0. 2 limit on the steel contribution ratio imposed on composite column sections in current design codes leads to the use of very slender steel plates in concrete-filled <b>steel</b> box <b>columns.</b> It is suggested that the section performance index of concrete-filled <b>steel</b> box <b>columns</b> should be as high as 0. 5 for a better structural performance. The use of high strength steels in concrete-filled <b>steel</b> box <b>columns</b> significantly increases the ultimate strengths of the columns but reduces their ductility...|$|R

25|$|The main {{building}} at Graceville had a butterfly roof formed with a reinforced concrete slab lined with bituminous felt and supported on ten pre-cast, reinforced concrete beams that cantilevered off a continuous lintel resting on ten brick piers. A range of materials {{were used to}} fill the gaps between the brick frame: including orange-coloured face brick, screened openings, some small sections of render and various aluminium-framed windows. On either side of this building, two wide butterfly-roofed, steel-framed shelters with built-in seating were erected.

Fitted to each steel column and under each beam were panels framed in steel and filled with glass above the seat level and sheet steel below. The other narrower platform necessitated smaller butterfly-roofed awnings be built there. They were essentially the same construction as the larger ones with only three bays, two of which were given over to seating. The subway system with its street ramps and stairs to both platforms was constructed with reinforced concrete.|$|E
