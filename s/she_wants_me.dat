2500|$|After a {{successful}} 2006, during which Aguilera released her critically acclaimed and commercially successful album, Back to Basics, Aguilera received a nomination for Grammy Award Best Pop Vocal Album at the 49th Annual Grammy Awards (2007) and won Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for its lead-single [...] "Ain't No Other Man". While on the Asian {{leg of the}} Back to Basics Tour, {{during the summer of}} 2007, Aguilera said that her upcoming album would be, [...] "short, sweet and completely different" [...] from its predecessor. After the birth of her son Max, Aguilera stated in an interview with Ryan Seacrest that her forthcoming album would include a completely new aspect of herself as an artist, because of the pregnancy with her son. In a February 2008 interview with People, Aguilera stated {{that she was going to}} start recording new material for her forthcoming album at her Beverly Hills, California residence. DJ Premier, who, at the time, was working on projects for his record label Year Round Records, shared plans to head back into the studio with Aguilera, and stated: [...] "She's doing an all pop album again, but <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to keep the tone like what we did before. She's ready to start next month." [...] Linda Perry, who had previously worked with Aguilera was to be included in the project too. In an interview with Billboard in October 2008, Aguilera said that the album would be mostly produced by Perry.|$|E

60|$|DAISY. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> {{to go and}} be fitted. She never lets me go out in Peking alone.|$|E
60|$|HER HUSBAND. I got {{a message}} from Georgina. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to go to her.|$|R
60|$|I {{was taken}} aback. I {{reflected}} that I had only seen him once. I {{did not know}} what <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to do.|$|R
60|$|She {{asked in}} her coaxing way, kissing {{me as she}} used to do at school when <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to do {{anything}} for her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{ought not}} to have left Knapwater last night. I wish I had not. I really think I will start at once. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me,</b> I know.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you won't be grand I won't be peppery. Nobody {{is going}} to boss me but Miss Celia; so I'll learn hymns if <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah that's another matter--about {{which you}} must talk to HER. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> {{no longer to}} keep seeing only with her eyes. She's {{throwing}} me into the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is rather}} luxurious for us," [...] said Mrs. Bowen. [...] "It's a {{compromise}} with Effie. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> {{to take her}} to Giacosa's this afternoon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To be frank, I {{have asked}} myself the question, and couldn't be quite {{sure it was}} {{altogether}} because <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to get this unfortunate steamboat off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There was no row," [...] said Gabriel moodily, [...] "only <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> {{to go for}} a trip to {{the west}} of Ireland and I said I wouldn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I {{have had}} my fill of Fortune's tricks,' cried he. 'If <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> she can find me here. But I {{have done with}} the wood for ever.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With her {{or without}} her, my dear; that {{concerns}} only your poor daddy. She has big interests over there, and <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> {{to take a}} look at them." ...|$|E
60|$|THE Bishop. Oh yes: {{she began}} the {{correspondence}} {{by making a}} very curious but very natural assignation. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to meet her in heaven. I hope I shall.|$|E
6000|$|... "We were engaged," [...] {{continued}} Lane. [...] "She wore my ring. When I enlisted <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> {{to marry}} her before I left. But I wouldn't do that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--in this house! Did {{you ever}} hear of such a little cat? I could tell you more than that. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to take them and dispose of them." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Colbert, however, did {{not leave}} me in any doubt as to what <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to do. <b>She</b> rushed up to me, and seized me by both hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said he {{somewhat}} lackadaisically; [...] "I {{suppose that}} would be the best, but Charlotte thinks another plan might be joined with it. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to marry you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your wife sent me," [...] {{said the}} tall man briskly, [...] "My name's Thompson--Dr. Thompson. She says you've got a case of small-pox on board which <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Ethel, [...] "Miss Winter {{has been}} talking to you. I know {{she said she would}} tell you that <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to give up Cocksmoor. You aren't dreaming of it, Margaret?" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was perhaps}} twenty minutes later, {{and we were}} {{standing}} together {{at the edge of}} the woods. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to come to the house to take breakfast with them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{should you}} wish me to {{interfere}} with you?" [...] I asked. [...] "I wouldn't keep out of it if <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> as much as <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> you. That, by your own admission, is exactly what she doesn't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{sure she}} wouldn't mind darning even my stockings," [...] he said. [...] "And I'm sure she'd do them well. Just as I wouldn't mind {{blacking}} her boots if <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mamma {{wanted us}} to come back," [...] {{explained}} Dora. [...] "She says, {{even if we do}} lose that fortune <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to have a better education, and she will pay the bill for Nellie and Grace, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{mean the}} spirit now {{standing}} behind you led me here. She says {{her name is}} Margaret Bartol. She said: 'Comfort my dear husband. Restore his faith.' She is smiling at me. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to go on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I hope not," [...] said Clifford. [...] "He has {{n't said}} so--in so many words--to me. But I know it worries him; and I want to stop {{worrying}} him. The Baroness knows it, and <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to stop, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, God {{bless the}} girl, what does <b>she</b> <b>want</b> <b>me</b> to say? And as for joking, surely that is {{innocent}} enough. You're as tender about the doctor {{as though he}} were a girl of seventeen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{mentioned}} it casually," [...] I explained: [...] "though now I {{come to think}} of it she asked me not to say so. What <b>she</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to impress upon you was that her father would be disappointed in you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Simple things," [...] complained Jessie to her mother, [...] "that I {{used to do}} when I was {{no bigger}} than Essie, and yet she is always teasing one about how and why! <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to tell why I carried one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it was--Miss Nash, {{the artist}} I told you about, {{asked me to}} meet her at the boat. I suppose <b>she</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to help her with her baggage and the customs and all them things. She's just coming from Paris." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{wants to}} be treated exactly like a human being, {{to be a human}} being, just like you or me. And she asks to stay with us, to be one of our family, and to learn how we live. She has asked me to advise her what books to read that are really nice, and where she can get a dress-maker, and how she can find a clergyman to sit under who would really be likely to {{understand}} her case, and everything. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to advise her about it all. She wants to put herself altogether in my hands. And she asked it all so nicely and sweetly. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to advise her about it all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} she wants," [...] Rupert muttered to himself. [...] "To stop my fencing lessons; just as if a gentleman could fence too well. <b>She</b> <b>wants</b> <b>me</b> to be a stiff, cold, finnikin fop, like that {{conceited}} young Brownlow, of the Haugh.|$|E
3000|$|... “One day I {{felt really}} bad, {{and my friend}} said contact them [the unit]. I said, forget it. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to call them. I told her no, come on, I’ll go to bed, {{there is no need}} to disturb them”. (Female, 64).|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "we'll go {{into the}} other points to-morrow, and to-night you're coming to Austerly's with me. Got word from Miss Nellie that I was to bring you sure. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> to send a team over for Eleanor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, because Emily {{never could}} bear to put {{herself in the}} wrong. But I know her. <b>She</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>me</b> back. But <b>she</b> wasn't going to own that I'd been right. She went round about. Most people do. Don't believe in it myself." ...|$|R
