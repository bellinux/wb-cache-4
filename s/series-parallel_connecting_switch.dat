The load sharing characteristics of the <b>series-parallel</b> <b>connected</b> interleaved LLC converter is then analyzed and a current sharing mathematical model is developed to illustrate the current sharing principles. A case example of a 300 / 12 - 18 V, 2. 5 kW, 500 kHz interleaved LLC resonant converter is designed and simulated to verify the proposed load sharing model. The established model's error analysis is conducted and the developed model is proved to have relatively high precision in current continuous mode and satisfactory precision in current discontinuous mode. The Monte Carlo analysis is executed to get an overall review of current sharing among different frequencies and the Worst Case analysis is executed to reveal the sensitivity of different influencing factors. The paper provides innovative and valuable references for the dimensioning of <b>series-parallel</b> <b>connected</b> interleaved LLC resonant converters...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{examine the}} {{feasibility}} of introducing power management schemes in network devices in the LAN. Specifically, we investigate the possibility of putting various components on LAN switches to sleep during periods of low traffic activity. Traffic collected in our LAN indicates that there are significant periods of inactivity on specific switch interfaces. Using an abstract sleep model devised for LAN switches, we examine the potential energy savings possible for different times of day and different interfaces (e. g., interfaces connecting to hosts to <b>switches,</b> or interfaces <b>connecting</b> <b>switches,</b> or interfaces <b>connecting</b> <b>switches</b> and routers). Algorithms developed for sleeping, based on periodic protocol behavior as well as traffic estimation are shown {{to be capable of}} conserving significant amounts of energy. Our results show that sleeping is indeed feasible in the LAN and in some cases, with very little impact on other protocols. However, we note that in order to maximize energy savings while minimizing sleep-related losses, we need hardware that supports sleeping. I...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{configuration}} for {{offshore wind}} farms based on variable-speed permanent magnet synchronous generator integration via high-voltage DC transmission is proposed. Each permanent magnet synchronous generator {{is equipped with}} a full-bridge diode rectifier and a DC/DC boost chopper, which constitutes a cascaded submodule. Quite a number of submodules are <b>series-parallel</b> <b>connected</b> to form a DC collector system for the offshore wind farm. Any unit that needs maintenance or that undergoes fault in a series-connected branch can be isolated from the system by the natural commutated process without influencing other normal units in the same branch. The proposed submodule has several prominent features, such as low cost, low power loss, and simple control strategy. A maximum power point tracking algorithm of each wind turbine is realized by controlling the current through the inductor of each DC/DC boost circuit in one submodule.

In particular the performance of routing algorithms derived from the L(_R-I) linear learning automata model are assessed for both types of network. A novel architecture using the INMOS Transputer is constructed for simulation of both circuit and packet switched networks in a loosely coupled multi- microprocessor environment. The network topology is mapped onto an identically configured array of processing centres to overcome the processing bottleneck of conventional Von Neumann architecture machines. Previous analytic work in circuit switched work is extended to include both asymmetrical networks and adaptive routing policies. In the analysis of packet switched networks analytic models of adaptive routing and flow control are integrated to produce a powerful, integrated environment for performance analysis The work concludes that routing algorithms based on linear learning automata have significant potential in both fully <b>connected</b> circuit <b>switched</b> networks and sparsely <b>connected</b> packet <b>switched</b> networks...|$|R
