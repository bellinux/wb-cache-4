In this example, the slip rings have a brush-lifting device and a sliding contact bar, allowing the slip-rings to be short-circuited when no longer required. This {{can be used in}} starting a <b>slip-ring</b> induction motor, for example.|$|E
50|$|A {{unipolar}} motor (also called homopolar motor) is {{a direct}} current (DC) motor typically with <b>slip-rings</b> on each end of a cylindrical rotor and field magnets or a DC field winding generating a magnetic field on the stator. The rotor has typically not a winding but just straight connections in axial direction between the <b>slip-rings</b> (e.g. a copper tube encasing the rotor or rods embedded in the rotor).|$|R

50|$|In a {{permanent}} magnet generator, {{the magnetic field}} of the rotor is produced by permanent magnets. Other types of generator use electromagnets to produce a magnetic field in a rotor winding. The direct current in the rotor field winding is fed through a <b>slip-ring</b> assembly or provided by a brushless exciter on the same shaft.|$|E
5000|$|Neuhof Substation is a 110 kV {{substation}} in Neuhof, {{an urban}} part of Bad Sachsa, Lower Saxony. The Neuhof substation went in service in 1985 and was {{connected with a}} 110 kV-powerline for three phase alternating current with the Wolkramshausen substation in former East Germany. It was therefore {{one of the few}} substations in former West Germany, into which electricity from GDR was fed. Through the Neuhof substation up to 40 MVA could be imported. Up to 25 MVA of the imported power could be fed via 5 rotary motor-generators, which were manufactured by Siemens and used for the compensation of frequency fluctuations of the East German power grid, into the power grid of West Germany. Additionally power was fed directly from the East German power grid into the grids of Bad Sachsa, Walkenried, Zorge and Wieda. The converters consisted of a three-phase asynchronous motor with a short circuited rotor on the driving side and an asynchronous generator with a <b>slip-ring</b> fed rotor, whereby the frequency adjustment was made by a static frequency inverter, which feeds the rotor. Startup of a converter took place using the <b>slip-ring</b> rotor with a conventional starter circuit. After the converter had reached its nominal speed, the short circuited rotor was connected, which then took over the drive. In April 1990 the plant was shut down and between 2003 and 2005 the machines were dismantled. The machine halls stand still today and are used by Harzenergie for internal purposes.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} solve the rather complex problem of {{actuating}} a sphere, {{a variety of different}} actuation mechanisms have been introduced. The CMU Ballbot used an inverse mouse-ball drive mechanism. Unlike the traditional mouse ball that drives the mouse rollers to provide computer input, the inverse mouse-ball drive uses rollers to drive the ball producing motion. The inverse mouse-ball drive uses four rollers to drive the ball and each roller is actuated by an independent electric motor. In order to achieve yaw motion, the CMU Ballbot uses a bearing, <b>slip-ring</b> assembly and a separate motor to spin the body on top of the ball. The LEGO Ballbot also used an inverse mouse-ball drive, but used normal wheels to drive the ball instead of rollers.|$|E
50|$|In {{accordance}} with these conditions, when a conductor or conductors move through {{a magnetic field}} to cut the lines of force, electrons are enabled to enter the conduction band thereby inducing an electric pressure {{for the production of}} alternating current in an external circuit. This may be referred to as an elementary alternator, consisting of a single wire loop called an armature with each end being attached to <b>slip-rings</b> and arranged so as to revolve midway between the magnetic poles. Two copper-graphite brushes connect with the external circuit on the <b>slip-rings</b> in order to collect the alternating current, generated in the conductor when the alternator is in operation. Another machine used for converting mechanical energy into electrical energy by means of electromagnetic induction is called a dynamo or direct current generator.|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{electrical}} commutators use {{slip rings}} for coupling. Slip rings however inject commutator noise into the connection. This is because as the contact points slide {{over the surface}} of the <b>slip-rings</b> they make microscopic bumps. The resultant variation in resistance and inductance causes electrical noise in the circuit. To reduce the electrical noise the contact points need to be pressed against the slip rings with greater force. This leads to great resistance and a higher rate of wear.|$|R
50|$|The {{field is}} uniformly {{perpendicular}} to the cylindrical rotor surface and does not change polarity over the 360-degree perimeter of the cylindrical part of the rotor. That means if the field is considered entering the rotor between the <b>slip-rings</b> it must leave the rotor though the rotor's end surfaces. It is not important that the magnetic field is generated from the stator; a similar field may be generated from the rotor with the same effect (the magnetic fields would not rotate with the rotor).|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A novel sensorless {{scheme for}} direct torque and fre-quency {{control of a}} double-inverter-fed <b>slip-ring</b> {{induction}} motor is presented. The analysis of a double-inverter-fed induction motor is given to derive the proposed controller. Various frequency profiles are analyzed for a direct frequency controller. A novel frequency profile is suggested to make the sensorless drive operation reliable and machine parameter independent at any rotor speed. Simula-tion and experimental results are presented from a 50 -hp drive, demonstrating that the drive can deliver full torque from 0 to 2 -p. u. speed in either direction.

40|$|The {{operation}} of a stand-alone, as opposed to grid connected generation system, using a <b>slip-ring</b> induction machine as the electrical generator, is considered. In contrast to an alternator, a <b>slip-ring</b> induction machine can run at variable speed and still deliver constant frequency power to loads. This feature enables optimization of the system when the prime mover is inherently variable speed in nature eg. wind turbines, as well as diesel driven systems, where there is scope for economizing on fuel consumption. Experimental results from a system driven by a 44 bhp diesel engine are presented. Operation at subsynchronous as well as super-synchronous speeds is examined. The measurement facilitates {{the understanding of the}} system as well as its design. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{finite element}} method {{has been used to}} analyse three topologies of iron-powder {{electrically}} magnetized synchronous machines. The first topology has the field winding placed in magnetically conducting end-plates, eliminating the need of <b>slip-rings.</b> In the second topology this is achieved by placing the winding above the outer rotor, and the third topology corresponds to the more conventional design with the field coils in the rotor. The results show that the first topology outputs 60 % more torque than the other designs, although the three topologies present similar characteristics with regard to torque densit...|$|R
50|$|The voltage {{between the}} rotor {{connections}} (<b>slip-rings)</b> is normally {{low and the}} current then must be high to generate significant power. Current in the kiloampere range was applied for larger motors. The device also works in reverse as a generator if driven. It is useful for generating very large currents at low voltage. It {{does not appear to}} comply with a simple interpretation of Maxwell's equations {{in the sense that the}} magnetic field does not at any point pass though any closed winding to generate an electromagnetic effect.|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} of operating the three phase <b>slip-ring</b> induction motor {{as a series}} connected motor is explored. The merits and drawbacks of this mode of operation are discussed. For this purpose the necessary mathematical models along with the corresponding computer simulation are developed and experimental verification of the theoretical results is also carried out. It {{has been found in}} general that operation of <b>slip-ring</b> induction motors as series connected motors is possible providing that the rotor winding is connected in a sequence opposite to that of the stator winding. This adds flexibility to the modes of operation of these motors. Moreover synchronous operation is also possible, providing that the series connected motor is driven initially at twice its synchronous speed and then connected to the supply. © 1997 IEE...|$|E
40|$|In {{applications}} such as radar and wind turbines, it is often necessary to transfer power across a constantly rotating interface. As the rotation is continuous, {{it would be impossible}} to use wires to transfer the power as they would soon become twisted and stretched and the system would fail.

50|$|If {{connections}} to the rotor coils of a three-phase motor are taken out on <b>slip-rings</b> and fed a separate field current to create a continuous magnetic field (or if the rotor consists of a permanent magnet), the result is called a synchronous motor because the rotor will rotate synchronously with the rotating magnetic field produced by the polyphase electrical supply. Another synchronous motor system is the brushless wound-rotor doubly fed synchronous motor system with an independently excited rotor multiphase AC winding set that may experience slip-induction beyond synchronous speeds but like all synchronous motors, does not rely on slip-induction for torque production.|$|R

The artefacts included as grave goods also differ from those typically found in earlier centuries. Brooches and long strings of beads become less common in female graves, while weapons become less common in male graves. Men's graves often include small buckles, knives, and sometimes shoelace tags. Women's graves typically consist of pins, chatelaines with such accessories as purse-mounts and workboxes, and necklaces containing small, monochrome beads, gold pendants, and <b>slip-rings</b> made of silver or bronze.|$|R

A wound rotor induction motor is large ac motor that controlled starting characteristics and adjustable speed capability.

The first part of this work concentrates on the study of the magnetic interface and its electrical properties. Initially the magnetic structure of the transformer is studied in order to gain understanding {{of the effects of the}} physical layout of the component to its electrical behaviour. The problems of low magnetising and increased leakage inductance are quantified by measurements, calculations and finite element analysis. An accurate electrical model is built and used to calculate the transformer voltage and current gain. The second part of the research programme aims at the compilation of a design strategy for a PSFB incorporating a rotating transformer. An algorithm is presented, that optimises the magnetic component structure in order to achieve minimum switching losses and spread the conduction losses between the transformer and power switches.

40|$|Abstract. Belt {{conveyors}} are {{a dominant}} mean of transport in modern open-pit mines in Bosnia and Herzegovina. They are usually driven by three-phase induction <b>slip-ring</b> motors of a nominal voltage of 6 kV and nominal power from 200 to 1000 kW. Efficiency of the transport {{system is the}} crucial parameter {{of the level of}} economical exploitation of an open-pit mine as a whole. The main problem which prevent optimal transport-system efficiency is insufficient synchronization between the production and transport capacities. Since the conveyors in the open-pit mines in Bosnia and Herzegovina are mainly driven by three-phase induction <b>slip-ring</b> motors, the most appropriate solution to control the conveyor speed (the speed of the drive motors) is to use a subsynchronous constant torque cascade with a static voltage and frequency converter. The basic elements of the subsynchronous cascade are a diode bridge rectifier and a thyristor inverter bridge, as well as a power transformer whose nominal power depends on the control range and which sends electricity back to the power grid. The paper describes a mathematical model to calculate the subsynchronous cascade parameters used in controlling the speed of electric-motor drives for belt conveyors...|$|E

40|$|Doubly-fed {{induction}} generator (DFIG) -based wind turbines (WTs) {{are reported to}} suffer reliability problems due {{to the presence of}} <b>slip-rings,</b> brushes, and the gearbox. These disadvantages encouraged several research groups to investigate the viability of employing single or double-frame brushless cascade DFIGs (BCDFIGs) in grid-connected multimegawatt WTs especially offshore and in solar chimney power plants. In this regard, this paper tackles three main issues. Initially, the expected reduction in gear ratio when BCDFIGs are used instead of DFIGs is examined from a steady state perspective. A reduction would lead to less frequent maintenance and an improved return on investment. Next, a detailed comparison between DFIG-WTs and BCDFIG-WTs under unbalanced grid voltage is presented.
