50|$|The Lindenberg, peaking at 878 m, is {{a wooded}} {{hill in the}} Swiss Plateau north of the Alps, {{situated}} between the valleys of the Aabach, the Bünz and the Reuss. The hill draws a straight north-south line. On his ridge lies {{the border between the}} cantons of Lucerne (western slope) and Aargau (eastern slope and the northern half of the hill). Although the highest peak lies in the canton of Lucerne in the municipality of Müswangen, around 75% of the hill lies in the Aargau. The highest point is unspectacular as it is very flat and wooded; it can be reached by foot, by bike or even by jeep. Despite being overgrown with large forests and fields, many villages are situated on the hill's slopes and at its base, some of the bigger are Muri AG, Sins, Hochdorf and Hitzkirch. The hill is a frequently used place for bikers, hikers, equestrians and families, as several restaurants exist on various places of the hill. Despite his low altitude for <b>Swiss</b> <b>standards,</b> at some points the view is quite a sight as Lake Zug, Lake Hallwil and Lake Baldegg and prominent Swiss mountains as Säntis, Tödi, Titlis and Finsteraarhorn can be seen from some places, like Horben.|$|E

30|$|According to the interviewees, ALUSIM did {{not address}} a {{sufficient}} number of business tasks carried out in Switzerland, thus leading to construct underrepresentation concerning commercial apprenticeship and typical job requirements in Switzerland (e.g., Interview 4). They also suggested that company size might influence job requirements (e.g., Interview 1). Larger companies tend to have a greater division of labor, more specific tasks and customer contact that varies among email, in-person and/or telephone contact. In smaller companies, employees tend to be more involved in multiple tasks and entire processes. Therefore, the interviewees suggested adding additional tasks to ALUSIM, such as event organization (e.g., Interviews 2 and 5), or intensifying tasks focusing on customer communication (e.g., Interviews 1, 2 and 5). Finally, the experts recommended changing the visual design of the documents to comply with <b>Swiss</b> <b>standards,</b> and adding Internet research and presentation tasks. These latter tasks are representative of the tasks required in Switzerland, according to the experts.|$|E

The behaviour of the test sections corresponds to the results provided by laboratory test made with LCPC rutting tests. The section designed to have a strong rut resistance has no rut in the base layer.

The three structures were designed to have an equivalent fatigue resistance and were submitted to loading with a traffic simulator. This device, a truck axle, permits to simulate heavy traffic on roads.

An alternative to the above is a complete review of CERN's water consumption, reducing our needs by half, thus allowing savings in both investment and operation. This reduction in investment cost would be diverted towards much needed consolidation works for the existing facilities within CERN.

In 1989, we planned a multi-centre study on growth and endocrine complications in patients who started chelation therapy with DFX early in life. Height, weight, endocrine complications, haematological variables and compliance with DFX were evaluated in a study group of 238 patients aged 2 - 17 years with beta-thalassaemia major regularly followed in 13 paediatric and haematological Italian centres. The LMS method by Cole and Green and the Mann-Whitney test were applied for statistical analysis. Twenty-six patients with thalassaemia (12. 4 %) had growth hormone insufficiency, five patients (2. 1 %) had primary hypothyroidism and four patients (1. 7 %) had hypoparathyroidism.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} impact of traffic and construction-induced {{vibrations}} on existing facilities. Protecting measures are very limitied, {{therefore it is}} necessary to set out the calculations and measurrements before the construction work. Parameter for assesing the impact of vibration on the building, which is widely recognized and compared to the criteria given in standard, is peak particle velocity. Based on the peak particle velocity we can determine the minimum distance between the source and existing building, in order to avoid construction damage. Slovenia has no standard for setting limit values for peak particle velocity. We have listed the limit values of peak particle velocity as defined in British, Austrian, German and <b>Swiss</b> <b>standards.</b> Dynamic analyses with computer program Plaxis were carried out to analyze the impact of consrtuctioninduced vibrations on the ground. Since we are interested in the surface waves, the measuirng points were set on ground surface. We selected the appropriate time interval and recorded the highest peak particle velocity. As we were interested in the influence of soil characteristics on the results, the stifness of the ground was varied in the first case and the results compared to empirical equation. In the second case, the results using two different soil material models were compared. A linear-elastic and HS-Small model were used to model the soil. As in first case, the comparission of the calculated peak particle velocities showed, that the HS-Small model is more suitable for the analysis of ground vibrations...|$|E

The developed quality control system is directed to aerial surveying companies and at same time it can be used as guidelines for specifications for photogrammetric products like aerial triangulation, DTM, orthophoto and mosaic generation, data collection and so on. It is based on quality management standards ISO 9000 and in the <b>Swiss</b> <b>Standards</b> Guidelines and the others. In order to detect the main problems arising during the photogrammetric products production, several aerial surveying companies as well as their customers were asked to participate in a surveying. In this way {{a significant part of the}} difficulties of photogrammetric products had been identified and analyzed and correction have been proposed to meet customers and company expectations. The main sources of errors are identified and analyzed in order to be corrected or reduced in the control quality system. During research some specific problems had been found, as for instance, quality control on the image acquisition process. In that case, the probable causes in the process had been investigated for the inclusion of corrective actions. Also, each step of the process was investigated and controlled in order to obtain individual quality parameters that, collectively, are able to assure the quality of the final product, mostly considering aspects of precision and accuracy requirements for mapping production based on the customer’s expectations. One of the main functions of the developed control quality systems is for implementation of the corrective actions in the procedure of production process. 1...|$|E
40|$|Winter tourism that is intensively {{developed}} in the Russian Federation in recent years strongly depends on the snow availability and properties in the region. Climate changes exert significant influence on the functioning of mountain ski resorts, {{especially if they are}} located in areas with relatively high air temperatures in winter season. At the present time, a snowy cluster of mountain ski resorts is intensively progressing in vicinity of Krasnaya Polyana. This region in the West Caucasus (Russia) is characterized by relatively warm climate conditions. The snow cover thickness (of 1 % insurance) in area of the Aibga mountain range may reach 8. 1 m. But the snow cover thickness is not the only characteristic of the mountain skiing attractiveness. According to the <b>Swiss</b> <b>standards</b> a mountain ski resort can be considered reliable if during seven seasons of ten ones the snow cover with minimal thickness of 30 – 50 cm exists for a time not shorter than 100 days during a period from 1 st December till 15 th April. According to the forecast, during future decades the calculated amount of solid precipitation should reduce by 25 – 30 % in mountain regions on the south macro-slope of the Great Caucasus. As the calculations show, by 2041 – 2050 the maximal decade thickness of snow cover will decrease by 29 – 35 % while a number of days with snow – by 35 – 40 %. If this is the case, artificial snow will be needed in addition to the natural one. But, under warm climate conditions using of plants for artificial snow production will require a certain perfecting of the nowadays technologies, and very likely, with use of chemicals. That is why a shadowing of existing mountain ski routes by means of the tree planting along them could be ecologically more promising. As for the mountain ski resorts of the West Caucasus, we should mention a possible weakening of the avalanche activity as a potential positive effect of the climate warming predicted by models. </p...|$|E
