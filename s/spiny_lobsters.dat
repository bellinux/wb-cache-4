5|$|Female California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{a length of}} , which is typically at an age of 5–9 years; males are sexually mature after 3–6 years. Because all the hard parts are lost at each molt, {{the life span of}} mature <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> is uncertain; they are thought to live for 50 years or more.|$|E
5|$|California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> are nocturnal, {{hiding in}} crevices during the day, {{with only the}} tips of their long {{antennae}} showing, {{as a means of}} avoiding predators. Towards dawn, the <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> form aggregations, which they maintain until dusk. At night, they emerge and feed on sea urchins, clams, mussels and worms. This activity is important in limiting sea urchin populations, and so maintaining healthy seabed communities.|$|E
5|$|Lobster fishers may not land {{more than}} seven California <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> on any given day, and may not have {{more than seven}} in their {{possession}} at any time.|$|E
50|$|Other {{common names}} for the species in the United States include <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> Bermuda <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> common <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> crawfish, Florida <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> West Indian langouste and West Indian <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} the reader to the Florida <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> Panuluris argus; to show the economic potential for the mariculture of this species by exposing value and size of the U. S. <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> market; to present Florida’s legal provisions for mariculture and how <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> farming would be acceptable; to indicate the biological considerations for the rearing of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> larva and postlarva; and to introduce a general plan for the mariculture of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> that considers the legal provisions of leasing wetlands in Florida and incorporates the biological considerations of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster...</b>|$|R
5|$|Natural predators of the California {{spiny lobster}} include bony fish {{such as the}} California sheephead, giant sea bass and cabezone, sharks {{including}} the horn shark and leopard shark, octopuses and sea otters. In response to an approaching predator, <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> including the California spiny lobster can produce a loud noise using the stick-slip phenomenon, akin to a bowed instrument. The bases of the antennae act as a plectrum, which is rubbed over a file {{on the edge of}} the antennular plate. If a predator is very close, <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> will flex their muscular tail in order to escape the predator, backwards.|$|E
5|$|There is {{an annual}} migration, in which <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> enter {{shallower}} water {{in spring and}} summer, and head out to deeper water in fall and winter, reaching depths as great as , perhaps to avoid the effects of winter storms.|$|E
5|$|For {{those using}} lobster traps, the fishing effort is {{greatest}} {{at the beginning}} of the permitted season in California, and peters out towards the end of the season, 24 weeks later. Although the fishing effort becomes better concentrated on areas with more <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> during the season, the fishing efficiency (catch per unit effort) nonetheless decreases throughout the season.|$|E
50|$|Palinurus elephas is a <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> {{which is}} {{commonly}} {{caught in the}} Mediterranean Sea. Its common names include European <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> crayfish or cray (in Ireland), common <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> Mediterranean lobster and red lobster.|$|R
50|$|Panulirus versicolor is {{a species}} of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> that lives in {{tropical}} reefs. Other names include painted rock lobster, common rock lobster, bamboo lobster, blue <b>lobster,</b> and blue <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster.</b> P. versicolor {{is one of the}} three most common varieties of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> in Sri Lanka, alongside Panulirus homarus and Panulirus ornatus.|$|R

5|$|In Mexico, <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> are an {{important}} commercial resource, representing the fifth most valuable fishery, worth US$18 million. Three species are exploited along the Pacific coast of the Baja California peninsula, but the catch of 744t of the California spiny lobster makes up 95%–97% of the total, with only small quantities of Panulirus inflatus and Panulirus gracilis. The fishing rights are held by 26 local co-operatives.|$|E
5|$|The main legal {{restrictions}} on fishing for California spiny lobster in Mexico are a minimum landing size of , {{the prohibition of}} catching berried females, and a closed season: from February 16 to November 15, fishing for <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> is prohibited in a region which moves south along Mexico's Pacific coast during the season.|$|E
5|$|The California {{spiny lobster}} {{is one of}} 19 species in the genus Panulirus, {{which is one of}} several genera of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> whose names are anagrams of the {{original}} spiny lobster genus, Palinurus. Its closest relatives are not the other species that occur in the East Pacific, but rather Panulirus argus from the Caribbean Sea and West Pacific species such as Panulirus japonicus, Panulirus marginatus, Panulirus pascuensis, Panulirus cygnus and Panulirus longipes; this relationship has been recovered from comparative studies of adult and larval morphology, as well as from molecular phylogenetics, using the sequences from cytochrome c oxidase and 16S ribosomal RNA genes.|$|E
50|$|Panulirus echinatus, {{the brown}} <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> is {{a species of}} <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> that lives on rocky reefs in the {{tropical}} western Atlantic Ocean and central Atlantic Islands.|$|R
50|$|Palinurus mauritanicus (common name: pink <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster)</b> is {{a species}} of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster.</b> It is found in deep waters in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the western Mediterranean Sea.|$|R
50|$|Panulirus guttatus, {{the spotted}} <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> or Guinea chick lobster, is {{a species of}} <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> that lives on shallow rocky reefs in the {{tropical}} West Atlantic and Caribbean Sea.|$|R
5|$|With its slender, lithe body, the whitetip reef shark {{specializes in}} wriggling into narrow crevices and {{holes in the}} reef and extracting prey {{inaccessible}} to other reef sharks. Alternatively, it is rather clumsy when attempting to take food suspended in open water. This species feeds mainly on bony fishes, including eels, squirrelfishes, snappers, damselfishes, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes and goatfishes, as well as octopuses, <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters,</b> and crabs. The whitetip reef shark is highly responsive to the olfactory, acoustic, and electrical cues given off by potential prey, while its visual system is attuned more to movement and/or contrast than to object details. It is especially sensitive to natural and artificial low-frequency sounds in the 25100Hz range, which evoke struggling fish.|$|E
25|$|<b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> tend {{to live in}} crevices {{of rocks}} and coral reefs, only {{occasionally}} venturing out at night to seek snails, clams, sea-hares, crabs, or sea urchins to eat. Sometimes, they migrate in very large groups in long files of lobsters across the sea floor. These lines {{may be more than}} 50 lobsters long. <b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> navigate using the smell and taste of natural substances in the water that change {{in different parts of the}} ocean. It was recently discovered that <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> can also navigate by detecting the Earth's magnetic field. They keep together by contact, using their long antennae. Potential predators may be deterred from eating <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> by a loud screech made by the antennae of the <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> rubbing against a smooth part of the exoskeleton. <b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> usually exhibit the social habit of being together. However recent studies indicate that healthy lobsters move away from infected ones, leaving the diseased lobsters to fend for themselves.|$|E
25|$|Like true lobsters, <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> are edible and are an {{economically}} significant food source; {{they are the}} biggest food export of the Bahamas, for instance.|$|E
50|$|Panulirus ornatus (known by {{a number}} of common names, {{including}} tropical rock lobster, ornate rock <b>lobster,</b> ornate <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> and ornate tropical rock lobster) is a large edible <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> with 11 larval stages that has not been successfully bred in captivity.|$|R
5000|$|Panulirus longipes, the longlegged <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster,</b> is {{a species}} of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobster</b> that lives on shallow rocky and coral reefs in the {{tropical}} Indo-Pacific region.

25|$|<b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> {{are found}} in almost all warm seas, {{including}} the Caribbean and the Mediterranean Sea, but are particularly common in Australasia, where they are referred to commonly as crayfish or sea crayfish (Jasus edwardsii), and in South Africa (Jasus lalandii).|$|E
25|$|The {{fossil record}} of <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> has been {{extended}} by the discovery in 1995 of a 110-million-year-old fossil near El Espiñal in Chiapas, Mexico. Workers from the National Autonomous University of Mexico have named the fossil Palinurus palaecosi, and report that it is closest {{to members of the}} genus Palinurus currently living off the coasts of Africa.|$|E
25|$|The {{fossil record}} of slipper {{lobsters}} extends back 100–120 million years, which is {{considerably less than}} that of slipper lobsters' closest relatives, the <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters.</b> One significant earlier fossil is Cancrinos claviger, which was described from Upper Jurassic sediments at least , and may represent either an ancestor of modern slipper lobsters, or the sister group to the family Scyllaridae sensu stricto.|$|E

25|$|<b>Spiny</b> <b>lobsters</b> have {{typically}} a slightly compressed carapace, lacking any lateral ridges. Their antennae lack a scaphocerite, the flattened exopod of the antenna. This is fused to the epistome (a plate between the labrum and {{the basis of}} the antenna). The flagellum, {{at the top of the}} antenna, is stout, tapering, and very long. The ambulatory legs (pereopods) end in claws (chelae).|$|E
25|$|Mariculture is {{the culture}} of marine organisms in seawater. The islands in the Maldives {{are too small to}} have inland fisheries, nor are there land based {{aquaculture}} activities at present. Fishing occurs in reef, coastal and offshore waters. However, various forms of mariculture are being experimentally trialled, such as {{the culture of}} pearls, giant clams, <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters,</b> bêche-de-mer and grouper.|$|E
25|$|Predators of {{this species}} other than mankind are sea otters (such as the {{southern}} sea otter, Enhydra lutris), fish (such as the California sheephead, Semicossyphus pulcher) and invertebrates, including crustaceans such as the striped shore crab, Pachygrapsus crassipes, and <b>spiny</b> <b>lobsters.</b> Competition for space with other species (such as the sea urchins Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and Strongylocentrotus franciscanus) is also frequent.|$|E
