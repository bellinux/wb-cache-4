40|$|The Southeast Florida Library and Information Network (SEFLIN) has {{presented}} the <b>Sun</b> <b>Seeker</b> Leadership Institute biennially since 1997. SEFLIN, a multitype library consortium headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, {{was one of}} the first groups to sponsor a library leadership institute held as a monthly series of events over the period of a year. One hundred library staff members from all types of libraries, large, small, public, and academic, have completed the leadership institute. After twelve years and six cohorts, SEFLIN is reviewing the project’s impact. This article outlines how and why the leadership institute was created, the program’s goals and format, and presents the results of a survey of past participants. The authors suggest further study of how participants are affected by the leadership styles modeled by their supervisors...|$|E

50|$|<b>Sun</b> <b>Seekers</b> (German: Sonnensucher) is an East German film, {{directed}} by Konrad Wolf during 1958. It was banned and subsequently released only in 1972.|$|R
50|$|The actor {{starred in}} many films during the 1960s and early 1970s, and {{performed}} in fifty {{until the end}} of his career, including the 1961 Biennale Jury Prize winning Peace to Him Who Enters and the 1964 The Alive and the Dead, based on Konstantin Simonov's novel. He also worked with foreign studios, mainly East Germany's DEFA: He played in Konrad Wolf's 1958 <b>Sun</b> <b>Seekers</b> and in Frank Beyer's 1963 Naked among Wolves. In 1972, he appeared in The Dawns Here Are Quiet, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film.|$|R
40|$|The mission {{requirements}} for some satellites require that they spin continuously {{and at the}} same time maintain a precise direction of the spin axis. An analog-computer study has been made of an attitude control system which is suitable for such a satellite. The control system provides the necessary attitude control through the use of a spinning wheel, which will provide precession torques, commanded by an automatic closed-loop servomechanism system. The sensors used in the control loop are rate gyroscopes for damping of any wobble motion and a <b>sun</b> <b>seeker</b> for attitude control. The results of the study show that the controller can eliminate the wobble motion of the satellite resulting from a rectangular pulse moment disturbance and then return the spin axis to the reference space axis. The motion is damped to half amplitude in less than one cycle of the wobble motion. The controller can also reduce the motion resulting from a step change in product of inertia both by causing the new principal axis to be steadily alined with the spin vector and by reducing the cone angle generated by the reference body axis. These methods will reduce the motion whether the satellite is a disk, sphere, or rod configuration...|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} {{intended}} to be ready for release already in 1958, but the DEFA Commission and functionaries in the Ministry of Culture disapproved of the negative portrayal of party boss Weihrauch and the less than pristine conduct of the workers. The film's supporters pointed out its committed Socialist-Realist narrative, its positive depiction of Soviet-German cooperation and its artistic merits; actor Erwin Geschonneck used his influence to promote it. On 24 June 1959, after many deliberations, <b>Sun</b> <b>Seekers</b> was shown to the entire Politburo, including Walter Ulbricht. Although they requested to make several alterations, the members praised the film. It was authorized to be released on 5 October.|$|R
50|$|Very {{shortly before}} {{it was to be}} released, the Soviet embassy in Berlin intervened and demanded to ban the film. While the exact details of the request are unknown, the Soviets were worried that {{presenting}} a Uranium mine and its contribution to the nuclear arms race - in the film, the main motivation of the miners was to insure peace by breaking the American monopoly on atomic weapons - would undermine their position in the diplomatic struggle against the West. Although a publicity campaign took place in the months before, the film was denied release. On 5 October, a small article in Neues Deutschland declared that the producers decided to withdraw <b>Sun</b> <b>Seekers.</b>|$|R

40|$|Until German {{unification}} in 1990 {{the study}} of post- 1945 German film focused on the films of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), and largely ignored the film culture of DEFA in the German Democratic Republic (GDR). This dissertation addresses selected DEFA films of the immediate post-war period to 1966 under Soviet and German socialism. A striking attribute {{of many of these}} films is their reliance upon strong-willed and persistent female protagonists, who successfully raise issues of consequence while providing a model for the ideal worker (Arbeiterin or Arbeiter) under socialism. ^ The prominent female figures featured in the films of this study represent women under socialism as they interface with paid labor (Erwerbsarbeit). The filmic characters of these films evolve from idealized figures leading {{a way out of the}} ruins of war to complex worker-individuals interacting with the accepted model of work and career (for both sexes) in the GDR. Filmmakers were not content to merely provide examples of the GDR 2 ̆ 7 s constitutional commitment to equality for women in the workplace and in society; they made films about women in their workplaces in order to amplify the worker experience of emancipation they believed was possible. ^ This study contains film and cultural analysis for several films that have not received significant treatment including Bürgermeister Anna (Mayor Anna) directed by Hans Müller, Frauenschicksale (Destinies of Women) directed by Statan Dudow, and Sonnensucher (<b>Sun</b> <b>Seekers)</b> directed by Konrad Wolf. It also illuminates women 2 ̆ 7 s entry into the workplace in better-known films such as Wolfgang Staudte 2 ̆ 7 s Die Mörder sind unter uns (The Murderers are Among Us), Konrad Wolf 2 ̆ 7 s Der geteilte Himmel (Divided Heaven), and Spur der Steine (Trace of Stones) directed by Frank Beyer. The importance of the female figures of DEFA film, especially in this early period, represents a contribution to {{the study of}} DEFA film, representation of working women in GDR, and the discussion of gender in the context of the Cold War. ...|$|R
