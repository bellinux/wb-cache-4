2500|$|Marine farmers usually {{look for}} {{sheltered}} and unpolluted waters rich in nutrients. Often {{these areas are}} also desirable for other purposes. In the late 1990s, demand for coastal aquaculture space upsurged, increasing fivefold. Aquaculture consents developed haphazardly, with regional councils unsure about how marine farms might impact coastal environments. By 2001, some councils were inundated with marine farm applications, and were operating with inadequate guidelines for sustainably managing the coast. As the Ministry for the Environment put it: [...] "Attempts to minimise local or cumulative environmental effects resulted in bottlenecks, delays and high costs in processing applications for new marine farms, local moratoria, <b>submitter</b> fatigue and poor environmental outcomes. Marine farmers, local communities, and the government wanted change." ...|$|E

These mistakes {{can easily be}} entered into dbSNP if the <b>submitter</b> uses (1) uncritical bioinformatic alignments of highly similar but distinct DNA sequences, and/or (2) PCRs with primers that cannot discriminate between similar but distinct DNA sequences. Mitchell et al. (2004) [...] reviewed four studies [...] and concluded that dbSNP has a {{false positive}} rate between 15-17% for SNPs, and also that the minor allele frequency is greater than 10% for approximately 80% of the SNPs that are not false positives. Similarly, Musemeci et al. (2010) states {{that as many as}} 8.32% of the biallelic coding SNPs in dbSNP are artifacts of highly similar DNA sequences (i.e. paralogous genes) and refer to these entries as single nucleotide differences (SNDs). The high error rates in dbSNP may not be surprising: of the 23.7 million refSNP entries for humans, only 14.5 million have been validated, leaving the remaining 9.2 million as candidate SNPs. However, according to Musemeci et al. (2010), even the validation code provided in the refSNP record is only partially useful: only HapMap validation reduced the number of SNDs (3% vs 8%), but only accepting this method removes {{more than half of the}} real SNPs in the dbSNP. These authors also note that one source of submissions from the Lee group are plagued with errors: 20% of these submissions are SNDs (vs. 8% for submissions). However, as the authors note, ignoring all of these submissions would remove many real SNPs.|$|E

50|$|The {{shepherding}} process occurs {{before the}} conference meeting. Authors submit papers for the conference, then each paper {{is assigned to}} a shepherd, an experienced author who works with the <b>submitter</b> to improve his or her paper. The process often consists of three iterations in as many weeks where the shepherd makes suggestions for improvement and the <b>submitter</b> incorporates the suggestions. This one-on-one mentoring using the submitter's unfinished work as an example is very effective for teaching the <b>submitter</b> {{how to be a}} better writer, although its effectiveness is ultimately determined by the participants' dedication and their working relationship. At the end of the shepherding process, the shepherd recommends whether to accept the submission for review at the conference. An accepted submission should meet minimal quality standards for effective evaluation in the writers' workshop, and should have been improved significantly by the <b>submitter</b> during the shepherding process.|$|E
