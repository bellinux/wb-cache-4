40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{influence}} of recently-arrived big-box retail stores on the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> place of residential populations. It aims to further the understanding of challenges posed by big-box retailers to surrounding communities – beyond the narrow economic focus previously dominating the literature. A range of human geographical theories are used to investigate <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> place of Tempe residents, and whether the 2011 opening of IKEA Tempe has influenced these senses. A mixed-methodology comprising interviews – both sedentary and mobile – and mental mapping was used to capture responses from residents. This method collected spatial and biographical data. Results offer new insights into {{the influence of}} big-box industry on <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> place. First, <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> place were found to be informed by resident’s shared experiences of three phenomena: gentrification-related community transition, post-industrial economic shifts, and place attachment. Despite such shared phenomena, <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> place were complex, plural, and often conflicting at the individual level. Second, IKEA’s influence on <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> place was overall subtle, though not without complexity. On the one hand, IKEA did not upset local residents or dramatically unsettle their <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> place. In some cases, IKEA was viewed through a middle-class lens as putting Tempe "on the map " and redressing the suburb’s stigmas as a downtrodden, dirty place. On the other hand, material attachments to the place – an...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWord sense {{induction}} (WSI) is {{the task}} aimed at automatically identifying the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> words in texts, {{without the need for}} handcrafted resources or annotated data. Up till now, most WSI algorithms extract the different <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> a word 'locally' on a per-word basis, i. e. the different senses for each word are determined separately. In this paper, we compare the performance of such algorithms to an algorithm that uses a 'global' approach, i. e. the different <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> a particular word are determined by comparing them to, and demarcating them from, the <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> other words in a full-blown word space model. We adopt the evaluation framework proposed in the SemEval- 2010 Word Sense Induction & Disambiguation task. All systems that participated in this task use a local scheme for determining the different <b>senses</b> <b>of</b> a word. We compare their results to the ones obtained by the global approach, and discuss the advantages and weaknesses of both approaches...|$|R
