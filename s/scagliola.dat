King EdwardVII oversaw a partial redecoration in a Belle Époque cream and gold colour scheme. Many smaller reception rooms are furnished in the Chinese regency style with furniture and fittings brought from the Royal Pavilion at Brighton and from Carlton House. The palace has 775 rooms, and the garden is the largest private garden in London.

25|$|The Old Courthouse {{interior}} {{is composed of}} quadrants which are set apart by broad hallways which meet at the building's center. There they form a large, open three story rotunda. The rotunda is the dominating feature of the interior. It rises over 100 {{feet into the air}} and at the top features an allegorical painting representing peace and prosperity. The halls have mosaic floors and wall treatment composed of white marble dado which is capped with antique verde serpentine stone. Marbleized plaster, <b>scagliola,</b> panels complete the walls. The building's ceilings are decorated with plaster cornices and molded leaf and rosette compliments. The Honduras mahogany doors have a rail and panel design and beveled glass is used for decorative side lights and panels.|$|E
25|$|Bridgewater House, Westminster, London (1845–64) for Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere, {{in a grand}} Italianate style. The {{structure}} was complete by 1848, but interior decoration was only finished by 1864. The main (south) front is 144 feet long, of nine bays in more massive version of his earlier Reform Club, the garden (west) front is of seven bays. The interiors are intact apart from the north wing which was bombed in The Blitz. The main interior is the central Saloon, a roofed courtyard of two storeys, of three by five bays of arches on each floor, the walls are lined with <b>scagliola,</b> the coved ceiling is glazed and the centre has three glazed saucer domes. The decoration of the major rooms is not the work of Barry.|$|E
25|$|The State Music Room to {{the east}} of The Marble Saloon is about 30 by , {{probably}} designed by Valdrè and finished in the early 1780s. With an apse in the centre of the north wall, there are doors {{at each end of the}} side walls, though only the northern pair are real, the other two are false doors. The north has within the apse two sets of doors flanking a niche that is surrounded by a decorative frame. There are two un-fluted <b>scagliola</b> Corinthian columns on the corners of the apse and also within it flanking the niche. The walls are painted with panels in the form of Grotesques and Arabesques. The chimneypiece in the centre of the east wall of white marble inset with panels of rosso antico marble and with carved decoration of musical instruments in white marble and ormolu, this chimneypiece was sold in 1922 but bought back in 1991, and a new mirror above the chimneypiece was made to replace the original one. The plaster ceiling has gilt molded decoration and seven inset paintings. The central painting is circular and is of The Dance of the Hours after Guido Reni and is flanked to the north and south by two rectangular paintings of the four seasons. Between these large paintings are four smaller ones of landscape scenes. All the paintings are believed to be by Valdrè. The four crystal chandeliers are modern replacements for the original ones. The ancient Roman sculpture the Marine Venus, that used to stand in the niche, was purchased by Queen Victoria at the 1848 sale and is now at Osborne House. This has been replaced in the niche by a bust of William Pitt the elder by Joseph Wilton, which is on loan to the house. There is mention of a chamber organ in the room in 1779. Also sold in 1848 were two Italian neo-classical side tables with Verd antique tops the frames being carved with plaques of Leda and the Swan and Juno and her peacock, these are both now in the Wallace Collection.|$|E
25|$|The Queen's Temple {{originally}} designed by Gibbs in 1742 and {{was then called}} the Lady's Temple. This was designed for Lady Cobham to entertain her friends. But the building was extensively remodelled in 1772-4 {{to give it a}} neo-classical form. The architect was probably Thomas Pitt, the portico is based on the Maison Carrée. Further alterations were made in 1790 by Vincenzo Valdrè to commemorate George III recovering from madness with the help of Queen Charlotte after whom the building was renamed. The main floor is raised up on a podium, the main facade consists of a portico of four fluted Composite columns, these are approached by a balustraded flight of steps the width of the portico. The facade is wider than the portico, the flanking walls having niches containing ornamental urns. The large door is fully glazed. The room within is the most elaborately decorated of any of the Garden's buildings. The <b>Scagliola</b> Corinthian columns and pilasters are based on the Temple of Venus and Roma, the barrel-vaulted ceiling is coffered. There are several plaster medallions around the walls, Britannia Deject, with this inscription Desideriis icta fidelibus Quaerit Patria Caesarem (For Caesar's life, with anxious hopes and fears Britannia lifts to Heaven a nation's tears), Britannia with a palm branch sacrificing to Aesculapius with this inscription O Sol pulcher! O laudande, Canam recepto Caesare felix (Oh happy days! with rapture Britons sing the day when Heavenrestore their favourite King!) and Britannia supporting a medallion of the Queen with the inscription Charlottae Sophiae Augustae, Pietate erga Regem, erga Rempublicam Virtute et constantia, In difficillimis temporibus spectatissimae D.D.D. Georgius M. de Buckingham MDCCLXXXIX. (To the Queen, Most respectable in the most difficult moments, for her attachment and zeal for the public service, George Marquess of Buckingham dedicates this monument). Other plaster decoration on the walls are 1. Trophies of Religion, Justice and Mercy, 2. Agriculture and Manufacture, 3. Navigation and Commerce and 4. War. Almost all the decoration was the work of Charles Peart except for the statue of Britannia by Joseph Ceracchi. In 1842 the 2nd Duke of Buckingham inserted in the centre of the floor the Roman mosaic found at nearby Foscott. The Temple has been used for over 40 years by the School as its Music School.|$|E
500|$|On {{the roof}} of City Hall are [...] {{ornamental}} urns, originally made of limestone. During the last remodel they were replaced using lightweight material for pedestrian safety. The building features dentil molding where the roof meets the walls, and the fourth floor has a balcony with paired Tuscan columns on the west side. Additionally, the exterior features keystones over the windows on {{the first and second}} floors, plus a balustrade along the roof line. Inside the High Renaissance building, the columns of the lobby are covered with a fake marble coating called <b>Scagliola.</b> The lobby has marble flooring and oak woodwork. In the atrium the walls are covered in a white tile that was re-discovered during the 1996 remodel.|$|E

[...] The two bell towers – which are asymmetric – have been labelled as the cathedral's [...] "most prominent visual feature". [...] The taller steeple was originally designed to have flying buttresses at the bottom. [...] The interior features columns that support the nave which are made from red <b>Scagliola</b> marble. [...] The cathedra is situated at the centre of the sanctuary, surrounded by an oak altar-piece and two towers of reredos. [...] In total, the dimensions of the church building are [...] long, [...] wide and [...] tall, with the taller steeple rising to [...]|$|E
2500|$|The courthouse's upper {{stories are}} reached by a broad white marble stairway. It {{features}} bronze fish-scale screens which {{are decorated with}} laurel wreaths, {{the same type of}} screen closes the rails around the rotunda opening. Inside the rooms are sand cast plaster cornices and a variety of floor finishes which include mosaic, marble and maple. The original stenciling in the rooms has been lost to the past. The three original courtrooms are decorated with frescoes, marble dadoes and <b>scagliola.</b> The original fresco remains in the Stevenson-Ives library. [...] Other notable architectural features include many beveled and leaded glass panels, <b>scagliola</b> door surrounds, solid bronze wall partitions, a number of original bronze, combination gas and electrical light fixtures and marble counters.|$|E
2500|$|The pilasters were of gray <b>scagliola</b> with gilt-bronze capitals {{supplied}} by Gouthière. The girandole lights suspended {{in front of}} the mirrors between the pilasters were semi-circular, so that with their reflection in the mirrors they appeared to be circular chandeliers hanging in space, a useful trompe l'œil to enlarge the somewhat cramped space, which was essentially an enlarged vestibule between the entrance and the Salon du Roi.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} {{details were}} accented with terra cotta and <b>scagliola.</b> [...] Doors were oak with brass hardware and [...] "US" [...] molded into doorknobs. [...] Mahogany {{was used in}} courtrooms and other offices. [...] Marble from Tennessee, Vermont, Maine and Italy was used in corridor floors, wainscoting and stairways. [...] Floors in the rotunda were marble accented with mosaic tile while railings and elevator grilles throughout the building were wrought iron. [...] Ceilings were framed by egg-and-dart mouldings. [...] The four courtrooms {{on the sixth floor}} contained a series of murals depicting historical moments in the development of law.|$|E
2500|$|The Ante-Library located {{immediately}} {{to the north of}} the Large Library, created in 1805, this is really a wide corridor, about [...] long, and low in height, with a plain ceiling and walls, the fireplace on the east wall is a replacement for the carved marble one sold in 1922. The main feature of the room are the eight Tuscan columns of <b>scagliola</b> imitating Verd antique marble, the work of Domenico Bartoli. The room housed in 1838 a series of 52 family portraits, including: The Rt Hon. George Greville prime minister, by Sir Joshua Reynolds, now in the Bass Museum; a [...] portrait of George, Marquess of Buckingham, by John Jackson now at Christ Church, Oxford; Mary Nugent, Marchioness of Buckingham by Sir Joshua Reynolds, last sold in 1989 and present whereabouts unknown; William Wyndham, Lord Grenville by John Hoppner now in the North Carolina Museum of Art.|$|E
2500|$|The Marble Saloon is {{the grandest}} {{interior}} in the House, located immediately behind the south portico. Based on the Pantheon. It is elliptical in plan, , the domed ceiling is over [...] high. The room was probably designed by Vincenzo Valdrè, {{the basic structure}} was built between 1775 and 1777 but decoration was probably only complete by 1788 {{at a cost of}} £12,000. The lower half of the walls are surrounded by 16 unfluted Roman Doric columns made from red <b>scagliola</b> with white veins that mimics Sicilian Jasper the work of Domenico Bartoli and with white marble capitals and bases, supporting a richly detailed Doric entablature of white plaster with satyrs on the metopes. Hanging from the soffit of the entablature between each pair of columns are replica brass lanterns with glass domes, these are copies of the original light fittings. These columns flank four doors on the cardinal directions, the rest flank plain niches that once contained eight Ancient Roman statues these were sold in 1848, new plaster casts of eight statues from the Berlin State Museums were added to the niches flanking each door and were unveiled in September 2009. Added {{at the same time to}} the niches between each pair of statues were fibreglass copies of the original gilded Athéniennes (or Torchieres), the originals were made of timber and painted and gilded to resemble metal. Above the niches and doorways are white plaster rectangular reliefs depicting arms and trophies. Above the entablature is the very elaborate frieze, this consists of over 280 human and 14 animals in plaster all alto-relievo, the sculptor was probably Charles Peart. The subject of the frieze is the suovetaurilia. The dome is coffered of white plaster, there are 160 coffers nearly all of unique shape. The coffers contain highly decorated rosettes, and the ribs in between are also very elaborately decorated. There is a central skylight also elliptical. The floor is made of 72 four-foot-square slabs of white Carrara marble resting on a brick vault, in the centre of the floor is a metal grill part of the heating system. This is the first room to be fully restored to its pre-1848 condition.|$|E
60|$|Lord Martindale {{met them}} with his grave kind welcome, which awed even Helen into quiet and decorum, though perhaps, {{from the corners of}} her eyes, she was spying the <b>Scagliola</b> columns as places for hide-and-seek. She opened them to their roundest extent as her grandmamma came down-stairs, and she tried to take shelter behind her brother from the ceremonious kiss, while Johnnie tightly {{squeezed}} his aunt's hand, and Lady Martindale was quite as much afraid of them as they could be of her.|$|E
60|$|The 'Sarcophagus' {{displays}} every known {{variety of}} architecture and decoration. The great library is Elizabethan; the small library is pointed Gothic; the dining-room is severe Doric; the strangers' room has an Egyptian look; the drawing-rooms are Louis Quatorze (so called because the hideous ornaments displayed {{were used in the}} time of Louis Quinze); the CORTILE, or hall, is Morisco-Italian. It is all over marble, maplewood, looking-glasses, arabesques, ormolu, and <b>scagliola.</b> Scrolls, ciphers, dragons, Cupids, polyanthuses, and other flowers writhe up the walls in every kind of cornucopiosity. Fancy every gentleman in Jullien's band playing with all his might, and each performing a different tune; the ornaments at our Club, the 'Sarcophagus,' so bewilder and affect me. Dazzled with emotions which I cannot describe, and which she dared not reveal, Mrs. Chuff, followed by her children and son-in-law, walked wondering amongst these blundering splendours.|$|E
60|$|The walk {{were painted}} {{so as to}} deceive the eye with interminable colonnades; and groups of columns of the finest <b>Scagliola</b> work of {{variegated}} marbles--emerald-green and gold, St. Pons veined with silver, Sienna with porphyry--supported a resplendent fresco ceiling, arched like a bower, and thickly clustering with mimic grapes. Through all the East of this foliage, you spied in a crimson dawn, Guide's ever youthful Apollo, driving forth the horses of the sun. From sculptured stalactites of vine-boughs, here and there pendent hung galaxies of gas lights, whose vivid glare was softened by pale, cream-colored, porcelain spheres, shedding over the place a serene, silver flood; as if every porcelain sphere were a moon; and this superb apartment was the moon-lit garden of Portia at Belmont; and the gentle lovers, Lorenzo and Jessica, lurked somewhere among the vines.|$|E
60|$|Arthur {{gave his}} horse to the groom at the rectory gate, and {{walked along the}} gravel towards the door which opened on the garden. He knew that the rector always breakfasted in his study, and the study lay on the left hand of this door, {{opposite}} the dining-room. It was a small low room, belonging to the old part of the house--dark with the sombre covers of the books that lined the walls; yet it looked very cheery this morning as Arthur reached the open window. For the morning sun fell aslant on the great glass globe with gold fish in it, which stood on a <b>scagliola</b> pillar {{in front of the}} ready-spread bachelor breakfast-table, and by the side of this breakfast-table was a group which would have made any room enticing. In the crimson damask easy-chair sat Mr. Irwine, with that radiant freshness which he always had when he came from his morning toilet; his finely formed plump white hand was playing along Juno's brown curly back; and close to Juno's tail, which was wagging with calm matronly pleasure, the two brown pups were rolling over each other in an ecstatic duet of worrying noises. On a cushion a little removed sat Pug, with the air of a maiden lady, who looked on these familiarities as animal weaknesses, which she made as little show as possible of observing. On the table, at Mr. Irwine's elbow, lay the first volume of the Foulis AEschylus, which Arthur knew well by sight; and the silver coffee-pot, which Carroll was bringing in, sent forth a fragrant steam which completed the delights of a bachelor breakfast.|$|E
60|$|Since the waking she {{had made}} some {{acquaintance}} with the house. There was no show of domestics, no curtseying housekeeper to parade the new mistress over the house; Mr. Egremont had told his wife that she must fill up the establishment as she pleased, but {{that there was an}} admirable cook downstairs, and he would not have her interfered with--she suited his tastes as no one else did, and she must be left to deal with the provisions and her own underlings. There was a stable establishment, and a footman had been hired in town, but there was besides only one untidy-looking housemaid, who began by giving warning; and Alice and Nuttie had roamed about without meeting any one from the big wainscotted dining-room with faded crimson curtains and family portraits, the older grimy, the younger chalky, to the two drawing-rooms, whose gilding and pale blue damask had been preserved by pinafores of brown holland; the library, which looked and smelt as if Mr. Egremont was in the habit of sitting there, and a big billiard-room, all opening into a shivery-feeling hall, with <b>Scagliola</b> columns and a few dirty statues between them; then upstairs to a possible morning-room, looking out over a garden lawn, where mowing was going on in haste, and suites of dreary shut-up fusty bedrooms. Nuttie, who had notions of choosing her own bower, could not make up her mind which looked the least inviting. It did not seem as if girls could ever have laughed together, or children clattered up and down the stairs. Mrs. Egremont begged her to keep possession for the present at least of the chamber where the grim housemaid had chosen to put her, and which had the advantage of being aired.|$|E
60|$|One sad November day, {{while the}} wind roared round the old palace {{and the rain}} lashed the lagoon, Pemberton, for {{exercise}} and even somewhat for warmth—the Moreens were horribly frugal about fires; it was a cause of suffering to their inmate—walked {{up and down the}} big bare sala with his pupil. The <b>scagliola</b> floor was cold, the high battered casements shook in the storm, and the stately decay of the place was unrelieved by a particle of furniture. Pemberton’s spirits were low, and it came over him that the fortune of the Moreens was now even lower. A blast of desolation, a portent of disgrace and disaster, seemed to draw through the comfortless hall. Mr. Moreen and Ulick were in the Piazza, looking out for something, strolling drearily, in mackintoshes, under the arcades; but still, in spite of mackintoshes, unmistakeable men of the world. Paula and Amy were in bed—it might have been thought they were staying there to keep warm. Pemberton looked askance at the boy at his side, to see to what extent he was conscious of these dark omens. But Morgan, luckily for him, was now mainly conscious of growing taller and stronger and indeed of being in his fifteenth year. This fact was intensely interesting to him and the basis of a private theory—which, however, he had imparted to his tutor—that in a little while he should stand on his own feet. He considered that the situation would change—that in short he should be “finished,” grown up, producible in the world of affairs and ready to prove himself of sterling ability. Sharply as he was capable at times of analysing, as he called it, his life, there were happy hours when he remained, as he also called it—and as the name, really, of their right ideal—“jolly” superficial; the proof of which was his fundamental assumption that he should presently go to Oxford, to Pemberton’s college, and, aided and abetted by Pemberton, do the most wonderful things. It depressed the young man to see how little in such a project he took account of ways and means: in other connexions he mostly kept to the measure. Pemberton tried to imagine the Moreens at Oxford and fortunately failed; yet unless they were to adopt it as a residence there would be no modus vivendi for Morgan. How could he live without an allowance, and where was the allowance to come from? He, Pemberton, might live on Morgan; but how could Morgan live on him? What was to become of him anyhow? Somehow {{the fact that he was}} a big boy now, with better prospects of health, made the question of his future more difficult. So long as he was markedly frail the great consideration he inspired seemed enough of an answer to it. But at the bottom of Pemberton’s heart was the recognition of his probably being strong enough to live and not yet strong enough to struggle or to thrive. Morgan himself at any rate was in the first flush of the rosiest consciousness of adolescence, so that the beating of the tempest seemed to him after all but the voice of life and the challenge of fate. He had on his shabby little overcoat, with the collar up, but was enjoying his walk.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must work}} the garden--I must work the garden," [...] I said to myself, five minutes later, as I waited, upstairs, in the long, dusky sala, where the bare <b>scagliola</b> floor gleamed vaguely in a chink of the closed shutters. The place was {{impressive}} {{but it looked}} cold and cautious. Mrs. Prest had floated away, giving me a rendezvous {{at the end of}} half an hour by some neighboring water steps; and I had been let into the house, after pulling the rusty bell wire, by a little red-headed, white-faced maidservant, who was very young and not ugly and wore clicking pattens and a shawl in the fashion of a hood. She had not contented herself with opening the door from above by the usual arrangement of a creaking pulley, though she had looked down at me first from an upper window, dropping the inevitable challenge which in Italy precedes the hospitable act. As a general thing I was irritated by this survival of medieval manners, though as I liked the old I suppose I ought to have liked it; but I was so determined to be genial that I took my false card out of my pocket and held it up to her, smiling {{as if it were a}} magic token. It had the effect of one indeed, for it brought her, as I say, all the way down. I begged her to hand it to her mistress, having first written on it in Italian the words, [...] "Could you very kindly see a gentleman, an American, for a moment?" [...] The little maid was not hostile, and I reflected that even that was perhaps something gained. She colored, she smiled and looked both frightened and pleased. I could see that my arrival was a great affair, that visits were rare in that house, and that she was a person who would have liked a sociable place. When she pushed forward the heavy door behind me I felt that I had a foot in the citadel. She pattered across the damp, stony lower hall and I followed her up the high staircase--stonier still, as it seemed--without an invitation. I think she had meant I should wait for her below, but such was not my idea, and I took up my station in the sala. She flitted, at the far end of it, into impenetrable regions, and I looked at the place with my heart beating as I had known it to do in the dentist's parlor. It was gloomy and stately, but it owed its character almost entirely to its noble shape and to the fine architectural doors--as high as the doors of houses--which, leading into the various rooms, repeated themselves on either side at intervals. They were surmounted with old faded painted escutcheons, and here and there, in the spaces between them, brown pictures, which I perceived to be bad, in battered frames, were suspended. With the exception of several straw-bottomed chairs with their backs to the wall, the grand obscure vista contained nothing else to minister to effect. It was evidently never used save as a passage, and little even as that. I may add that by the time the door opened again through which the maidservant had escaped, my eyes had grown used to the want of light.|$|E
6000|$|As I have intimated, he has painted {{little but}} portraits; {{but he has}} painted very many of these, and I shall not attempt in so few pages to give a {{catalogue}} of his works. Every canvas that has come from his hands has not figured at the Salon; {{some of them have}} seen the light at other exhibitions in Paris; some of them in London (of which city Mr. Sargent is now an inhabitant), at the Royal Academy and the Grosvenor Gallery. If he has been mainly represented by portraits there are two or three little subject-pictures of which I retain a grateful memory. There stands out in particular, as a pure gem, a small picture exhibited at the Grosvenor, representing a small group of Venetian girls of the lower class, sitting in gossip together one summer's day in the big, dim hall of a shabby old palazzo. The shutters let in a clink of light; the <b>scagliola</b> pavement gleams faintly in it; the whole place is bathed in a kind of transparent shade. The girls are vaguely engaged in some very humble household work; they are counting turnips or stringing onions, and these small vegetables, enchantingly painted, look as valuable as magnified pearls. The figures are extraordinarily natural and vivid; wonderfully light and fine is the touch by which the painter evokes the small familiar Venetian realities (he has handled them with a vigor altogether peculiar in various other studies which I have not space to enumerate), and keeps the whole thing free from that element of humbug which has ever attended most attempts to reproduce the idiosyncrasies of Italy. I am, however, drawing to the end of my remarks without having mentioned a dozen of those brilliant triumphs in the field of portraiture with which Mr. Sargent's name is preponderantly associated. I jumped from his [...] "Carolus Duran" [...] to the masterpiece of 1881 without speaking of the charming [...] "Madame Pailleron" [...] of 1879, or the picture of this lady's children the following year. Many, or rather most, of Mr. Sargent's sitters have been French, and he has studied the physiognomy of this nation so attentively that a little of it perhaps remains in the brush with which to-day, more than in his first years, he represents other types. I have alluded to his superb [...] "Docteur Pozzi," [...] to whose very handsome, still youthful head and slightly artificial posture he has given so fine a French cast that he might be excused if he should, even on remoter pretexts, find himself reverting to it. This gentleman stands up in his brilliant red dressing-gown with the prestance of a princely Vandyck. I should like to commemorate the portrait of a lady of a certain age and of an equally certain interest of appearance--a lady in black, with black hair, a black hat and a vast feather, which was displayed at that entertaining little annual exhibition of the [...] "Mirlitons," [...] in the Place Vendôme. With the exquisite modelling of its face (no one better than Mr. Sargent understands the beauty that resides in exceeding fineness), this head remains in my mind as a masterly rendering of the look of experience--such experience as may be attributed to a woman slightly faded and eminently distinguished. Subject and treatment in this valuable piece are of an equal interest, and in the latter {{there is an element of}} positive sympathy which is not always in a high degree the sign of Mr. Sargent's work. What shall I say of the remarkable canvas which, on the occasion of the Salon of 1884, brought the critics about our artist's ears, the already celebrated portrait of [...] "Madame G.?" [...] It is an experiment of a highly original kind, and the painter has had in the case, in regard to what Mr. Ruskin would call the [...] "rightness" [...] of his attempt, the courage of his opinion. A contestable beauty, according to Parisian fame, the lady stands upright beside a table on which her right arm rests, with her body almost fronting the spectator and her face in complete profile. She wears an entirely sleeveless dress of black satin, against which her admirable left arm detaches itself; the line of her harmonious profile has a sharpness which Mr. Sargent does not always seek, and the crescent of Diana, an ornament in diamonds, rests on her singular head. This work had not the good-fortune to please the public at large, and I believe it even excited a kind of unreasoned scandal--an idea sufficiently amusing in the light of some of the manifestations of the plastic effort to which, each year, the Salon stands sponsor. This superb picture, noble in conception and masterly in line, gives to the figure represented something of the high relief of the profiled images on great friezes. It is a work to take or to leave, as the phrase is, and one in regard to which the question of liking or disliking comes promptly to be settled. The author has never gone further in being boldly and consistently himself.|$|E
50|$|There are two <b>scagliola</b> techniques: in {{traditional}} Bavarian <b>scagliola</b> coloured batches of plaster of Paris are worked to a stiff, dough-like consistency. The plaster is modified {{with the addition}} of animal glues such as isinglass or hide glue. Marezzo <b>scagliola</b> or American <b>scagliola</b> is worked with the pigmented batches of plaster in a liquid state and relies mainly on the use of Keene's cement, a unique gypsum plaster product in which plaster of Paris was steeped in alum or borate, then burned in a kiln and ground to a fine powder; invented around 1840, it sets to an exceptionally hard state. It is typically used without the addition of animal glues. Marezzo <b>scagliola</b> is often called American <b>scagliola</b> because of its widespread use in the United States {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth century. Slabs of Marezzo <b>scagliola</b> may be used as table tops. When set, <b>scagliola</b> is hard enough to be turned on a lathe to form vases, balusters and finials.|$|E
50|$|<b>Scagliola</b> columns are not {{generally}} built {{of the solid}} material. Instead <b>scagliola</b> is trowelled onto a canvas which is wrapped around the column's core, and the canvas peeled away when semi-hardened. The <b>scagliola</b> is then surfaced in place.|$|E
50|$|While {{there is}} {{evidence}} of <b>scagliola</b> decoration in ancient Roman architecture, <b>scagliola</b> decoration became popular in Italian Baroque buildings in the 17th century, and was imitated throughout Europe until the 19th century.

5000|$|Plasterers were {{tasked with}} {{restoring}} <b>scagliola,</b> {{a composite of}} selenite, glue and natural pigments, imitating marble and other hard stones. Making <b>scagliola</b> is a laborious 15-step process which has to be restarted if a single mistake is made.

All this <b>scagliola</b> was produced by Richard Feroze, England's leading contemporary scagliola-maker. [...] Italian plasterworkers produced <b>scagliola</b> columns and pilasters for Robert Adam at Syon House (notably the columns in the Anteroom) and at Kedleston (notably the pilasters in the Saloon).

The material may be veined with colors and applied to a core, or desired pattern may be carved into a previously prepared <b>scagliola</b> matrix. The pattern's indentations are then filled with the colored, plaster-like <b>scagliola</b> composite, and then polished with flax oil for brightness, and wax for protection. The combination of materials and technique provides a complex texture, and richness of color not available in natural veined marbles.|$|E
