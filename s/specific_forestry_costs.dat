40|$|If {{agriculture}} {{is included in}} an Australian emissions trading scheme then it may face from 2015 at the earliest, a price for its greenhouse gas emissions; and thereby have incentives to offset and lessen its emissions. Yet because there is currently little understanding of the spatial pattern of emissions in agricultural regions of Australia, {{the extent of the}} challenge the sector faces in reducing its emissions is not fully recognised. To improve our understanding, this study uses the National Greenhouse Accounts methodology to estimate the spatial and temporal patterns of agricultural emissions since 1990 in the key agricultural region in Australia’s southwest. This region generates almost 40 percent of the nation’s winter crop production and supports over a quarter of the nation’s sheep. The quantity and trajectory of emissions from each shire in this region are reported, thereby identifying where emission problems may be worsening or easing. The composition and causes of changes in emissions are discussed. This study also generates spatial estimates of sequestration costs by drawing on land and <b>forestry</b> <b>cost</b> and tree growth data. Many relatively low cost sites for carbon sequestration, based on permanent reforestation, are identified with the implication that agriculture may be able to cost-effectively offset its emissions, {{as well as some of}} those from other sectors.

40|$|Most Central European Capercaillie {{populations have}} been declining {{during the last}} century. In the Jura Mountains, at the border between Switzerland and France, {{remaining}} Capercaillie populations are now isolated and endangered. In this study, land-use and Capercaillie presence data were used to identify key landscape parameters by logistic regression modelling. We found that Capercaillie prefers areas at the highest altitude in the Jura Mountains that are characterised by continous forests and stands with intermediate canopy cover. At the local scale, winter habitat selection revealed a preference for open forests with a sparse canopy cover dominated by spruce and fir. Capercaillie avoided dense undercanopy and understorey, especially when dominated by beech. Population viability and sensitivity analyses underlined the crucial importance of adult female survival, chick survival and breeding success for populations maintenance. Legal bases, scientific knowledge and technical measures are now available to conserve the flagship species Capercaillie within Jura Mountains. Capercaillie-adapted forestry requires a mosaic distribtution of habitat types, with a matrix of open forests where fir is favoured, and understorey kept sparse. Preliminary essays indicate that grouse-adapted <b>forestry</b> <b>costs</b> are similar or even lower than present costs. To increase survival and breeding sucess, one option is to diminish human distrubance by limiting access to Capercailllie breeding and wintering areas. An action plan for the species should avoid more costly and intensive approaches such as the reintroduction of birds from other populations.

The paper first describes the economic analysis undertaken in the project evaluation procedure of the World Bank.

The third section illustrates valuation techniques and how these are employed to estimate all forest values. The purpose of the fourth section is to examine how analysis is implemented in project evaluation, focussing on five case studies undertaken by the FAO Investment Centre. The analysis reveals that the main determinants of the economic viability of forestry projects are the on-site private benefits, while a major weakness of project evaluations is the difficulty in including and evaluating on-site public benefits, mainly associated with externalities.

I used both demographic modeling and experimental field research to evaluate the role of terrestrial habitat in the population dynamics and conservation of pond-breeding amphibians. I began by using literature data to develop stochastic, stage-structured demographic models for two pond-breeding amphibian species and used these models to determine the potential effects of a range of core terrestrial habitat areas on population size and persistence. I next carried out field experiments designed to improve model accuracy. First, I manipulated terrestrial densities of juvenile amphibians and followed individual growth and survival of over one year. Results suggest that terrestrial density should be considered in models of amphibian population dynamics.

40|$|Tese submetida à Universidade de Reading para obtenção do Grau de Doctor of PhilosophyPortuguese {{forestry}} {{plays an}} important role in the economy of the country. Woodlands are mainly owned by non-industrial private landowners (NPFLs). Properties are very small and scattered. These structural characteristics, the social changes that have taken place in rural areas and the recurring forest fires make its future development (in terms of economic, social and ecological values) dependent on the implementation of new forms of forestry management. The history of farmers’ organisations in Portugal is not a very successful one, particularly in relation to forestry, which has been managed under individual systems. Hence farmers mentality towards forestry, their individual interests as well as their attitudes towards organisations can be seen as major impediments to the implementation of collective management strategy. The study examines the main features of the NPFLs involvement in forestry, and it concludes that they have held a <b>specific</b> <b>forestry</b> culture grounded in both affective and economic values. Their attitude towards organisations is also analysed and it seems favourable towards the implementation of an organisational process in the region. The study suggests some shifts to the organisational model in order to match both interests and the opinions of farmers and local agents. On the assumption that the implementation of new models and strategies for collective action in forestry must be based on specific features and interests of the target population, we have studied these issues in a particular region of Portugal, in order to test the acceptability of an organisational model and to put in place some of the strategic actions necessary in order to at later date implement a forestry organisational process. The thesis concludes by presenting a strategy for implementation of an organisational process in the region based upon knowledge acquired in the field study about landowner’s attitude and behaviour in relation to forestry, their attitudes towards organisations, and the acceptability of the organisational model.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of forestry {{to reduce the}} environmental effects {{is the focus of}} this essay. The purpose is to analyze the possibilities and difficulties of including carbon sequestration projects from forestry in carbon trading systems. Further a calculation of the cost of sequestering one tonne of carbon in Swedish forests is conducted. Increased demand for wood in production and as a substitution for fossil fuels requires measures within forestry that increase the growth and biomass. Increasing pressure to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has led to the inclusion of carbon sinks in the Kyoto protocol. Main conclusions show that the cost of sequestering one tonne of carbon dioxide through fertilization of Norway spruce in Sweden range between 13, 4 - 20, 6 SEK, for traditional <b>forestry</b> the <b>cost</b> range between 14, 3 - 17, 6 SEK depending on the discount rate.

40|$|Large-scale {{agriculture}} is increasing in anthropogenically modified {{areas in the}} Amazon Basin. Crops such as soybean, maize, oil palm, and others are being introduced to supply the world demand for food and energy. However, the current challenge is to enhance the sustainability of these areas by increasing efficiency of production chains and to improve environmental services. The Amazon Basin has experienced a paradigm shift away from the traditional slash-and-burn agricultural practices, which offers decision makers {{the opportunity to make}} innovative interventions to enhance the productivity in previously degraded areas by using trees to ecological advantage. This study describes a successful experiment integrating the production of soybean and paricá (Glycine max L. and Schizolobium amazonicum) based on previous research that indicated potential topoclimatic zones for planting paricá in the Brazilian state of Pará. This paper shows that a no-tillage system reduces the effects of drought compared to conventional tillage still used by many farmers in the region. The integrated system was implemented during the 2014 / 2015 season in 234. 6 ha in the high-potential zone in the municipality of Ulianópolis, Pará. Both soybean and paricá were planted simultaneously. Paricá was planted in 5 m x 2 m inter-tree spacing totaling 228 x 103 trees per hectare and soybean, in 4 m x 100 m spacing, distributed in nine rows with a 0. 45 m inter-row distance, occupying 80 % of the area. The harvested soybean production was 3. 4 t ha- 1, higher than other soybean monocultures in eastern Pará. Paricá benefited from soybean fertilization in the first year: It exhibited rapid development in height (3. 26 m) and average diameter (3. 85 cm). Trees and crop rotation over the following years is six years for forest species and one year for each crop. Our results confirm there are alternatives to the current production systems able to diminish negative impacts resulting from monoculture. In addition, the system provided environmental services such as reduced soil erosion and increased carbon stock by soil cover with no-tillage soybean cultivation. The soybean cover contributes to increased paricá thermal regulation and lower <b>forestry</b> <b>costs.</b> We concluded that innovative interventions are important to show local farmers {{that it is possible to}} adapt an agroforest system to large-scale production, thus changing the Amazon. 201...|$|R

40|$|Time {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} driving forces in Landscape Ecology. Time along with geosystem, biosystem and socialsystem determines landscape heterogeneity which reveals itself in different patterns and functions. Cultural Landscapes are the result of the interactions between man and environment along time. Évora (the pre-roman Ebora), the most important town in Alentejo province (Southern Portugal) is involved by a cultural landscape where not only archeological sites and old built structures (walls, roads, bridges houses, etc.) of several epochs are present, but also old parcel networks and <b>specific</b> agro <b>forestry</b> pastoral systems, the montados, exist. Many of the limits of those parcels are materialized by vegetation galleries playing an important role in what concerns the landscape ecological quality of the area. The work developed is a comparative study of the quality of the Évora cultural landscape between 1958 and 2007. This study is based on the interpretation of vertical aerial photos from 1958 and 2007, and on the use of GIS as a tool for the spatial and temporal analysis. The main goals are: •	To understand the contribution of time and human history in landscape structure; •	To study the changes from 1958 to 2007 in ancient cadastral systems and landscape ecological structure: focused in montados and ecological corridors •	To measure the contribution of ancient cadastral systems to the actual ecological structur...|$|R
40|$|Forestry {{has been}} {{considered}} to have potential in reducing the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide by sequestrating carbon in above-ground timber and below-ground roots and soil. This potential has been noted in the Kyoto Protocol, which identified <b>specific</b> <b>forestry</b> activities for which carbon sequestration credits could be obtained. To date, a few forestry efforts have been undertaken for carbon purposes, {{but most of these}} efforts have been on a small scale. Proposals have been under discussion, however, that would result in the creation of very large areas of new forest for the purpose of offsetting some of the additional carbon that is being released into the atmosphere. Concerns are expressed, however, that large-scale sequestration operations might have impacts on the world timber market, affecting timber prices and thereby reducing the incentives of traditional suppliers to invest in forest management and new timber production. Such a "crowding out" or "leakage" effect, as it is called in the literature, could negate much or all of the sequestered carbon by the newly created sequestration forests. Accordingly, {{the purpose of this study}} is to examine and assess the interactions between carbon sequestration forestry, particularly, newly created carbon forests, and the markets for timber. The approach of this study involves utilizing an existing Dynamic Timber Supply Model (DTSM) to examine the interactions between newly created sequestration forests and the markets for timber. This model has been used to examine global timber supply and, more recently, has been modified to include carbon considerations. This study suggests that even without any specific sequestration efforts, commercial forestry offers the potential to sequester substantial volumes of carbon, approaching ten gigatons (Gt) (or petagrams (Pg)), in vegetation, soils and market products over the next century. At current rates of atmospheric carbon build up this is equal to about three years of net carbon releases into the atmosphere. This volume of carbon sequestration could be increased 50 – 100 % by 50 million hectares (ha) of rapidly growing carbon-sequestering plantation forests, even given the anticipated leakages due to market price effects. Finally, the projections suggest that the amount of crowding out and carbon leakages are likely to be very modest. The 50 million ha of carbon plantations are projected to reduce land areas in industrial plantations, that is, crowd out, only from 0. 2 to 7. 8 million ha over the 100 -year period. The addition of carbon sequestration forests offers the potential to increase the carbon sequestration of the forest system more than 50 %, up to 5. 7 Gts, above that already captured from market activity. This estimate assumes that crowding out and associated projected leakages will occur. At current rates of atmospheric carbon buildup, about 2. 8 % of the expected total buildup in atmospheric carbon over the next century could be offset by 50 million ha of carbon plantations. ...|$|R
