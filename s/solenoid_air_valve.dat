40|$|We present VacuumTouch, a novel haptic {{interface}} architecture for touch screens that provides attractive force {{feedback to the}} user’s finger. VacuumTouch consists of an <b>air</b> pump and <b>solenoid</b> <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> that connect {{to the surface of}} the touch screen and suck the air above the surface where the user’s finger makes contact. VacuumTouch does not require the user to hold or attach additional devices to provide the attractive force, which allows for easy interaction with the surface. This paper introduces the implementation of the VacuumTouch architecture and some applications for enhancement of the graphical user interface, namely a suction button, a suction slider, and a suction dial. The quantitative evaluation was conducted with the suction dial and showed that the attractive force provided by VacuumTouch improved the performance of the dial menu interface and its potential effects. At the end of this paper, we discuss the current prototype’s advantages and limitations, as well as possible improvements and potential capabilities.

40|$|Abstract — Solenoid valves {{are used}} in air braking system in heavy vehicles. This is {{essentially}} used to prevent skidding in vehicles. Traditionally the coil uses copper wounded coils for producing the working flux for plunger attraction. Recent Cu price increases motivate careful examination of approaches to minimize Cu use. Approaches that can reduce Cu use without increasing losses include careful winding design, trading winding volume for core volume; replacing Cu with Al. Al wire is particularly attractive. The cost of Al is lower than it might appear from the cost per unit mass when the much lower density of Al is also considered, and the disadvantage of higher resistivity becomes less important. This paper shows the design details of a solenoid valve with aluminum wiring along with {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of copper and aluminum. It also includes the testing and performance results of aluminum <b>air</b> <b>solenoid.</b> Index Terms — <b>solenoid</b> <b>valve,</b> <b>air</b> braking system, Standard wire gauge, actuation, Retraction, on leak test, off leak test...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe flow {{condition}} of water supply pipelines {{are affected by}} terrain, buildings and other external factors, easy to produce the complex phenomenon of hydraulic transient. More seriously, it can cause the pipeline rupture, water supply interruption and equipment damage, resulting in huge economic loss. It is necessary to equip the <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> in actual projects to prevent the gas-liquid transient flow. Firstly, this paper illustrated the effect, the type and the principle of <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> in detail. Secondly, combined with the actual projects, the authors analyzed the numerical simulations of water hammer. At last, the authors compared the results of <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> simulation. The results show that by comparison, the two stages closing <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> reduces not only the negative pressure but also the positive pressure than the one stage closing <b>air</b> <b>valve.</b> So the two stages closing <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> for the preventive measure in practical engineering could be effective...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental programme on the dynamic behaviour of <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> {{performed in a}} large-scale pipeline apparatus. Dynamic flow tests were performed at large (full) scale, since previous quasi-steady flow tests at small scale {{did not lead to}} realistic results. Investigations in a large-scale pipeline apparatus lead {{to a better understanding of}} the physical processes associated with the dynamic performance of <b>air</b> <b>valves.</b> Float type <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> of nominal diameter of 50 and 100 mm were tested in geometrically similar 200 and 500 mm test sections, to allow for the assessment of dynamic scale effects and the development of dimensionless parameter groups and dynamic scale laws. The approach in the determination of the dynamic performance of <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> was to measure their response to flow acceleration/ decelerations, which are imposed upon the valve. In this way, the <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> behaviour following events like system start-up, pump trip and pipe rupture is simulated. Key results of the dynamic flow tests, including <b>air</b> release tests (<b>valve</b> slam) and column separation tests (effect of <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> on surge suppression), are presented and discussed...|$|R

50|$|Quadrajet carburetors have {{mechanical}} secondary {{throttle plates}} {{operated by a}} progressive linkage; the primaries open before the secondaries, and use on-demand <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> plates above the secondary throttle plates. The <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> are connected by a cam and linkage to the secondary fuel metering rods. As the airflow increases through the secondary bores, the <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> are pushed down, rotating a cam that lifts the secondary metering rods. The secondary rods are tapered {{in a similar fashion}} to the primary metering rods, effectively increasing the size of the fuel metering holes as the rods are lifted and delivering more fuel. Therefore, the position of the <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> will control both fuel and air flow through the secondary venturis, even if the secondary throttle plates are fully opened. Thus the Quadrajet acts like a vacuum-secondary carburetor and only delivers more fuel as it is needed.|$|R
5000|$|The spread-bore four-barrel carburetor, first {{released}} by Rochester in the 1965 model {{year as the}} [...] "Quadrajet" [...] has a much greater spread between the sizes of the primary and secondary throttle bores. The primaries in such a carburetor are quite small relative to conventional four-barrel practice, while the secondaries are quite large. The small primaries aid low-speed fuel economy and driveability, while the large secondaries permit maximum performance when it is called for. To tailor airflow through the secondary Venturis, each of the secondary throats has an <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> at the top. This is configured much like a choke plate, and is lightly spring-loaded into the closed position. The <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> opens progressively in response to engine speed and throttle opening, gradually allowing more air to flow through the secondary side of the carburetor. Typically, the <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> is linked to metering rods which are raised as the <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> opens, thereby adjusting secondary fuel flow.|$|R
