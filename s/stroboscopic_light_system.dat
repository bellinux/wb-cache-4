His results were later transferred to be applied in binaural beats.

[...] In early 1966 Andy Warhol's lights engineer Danny Williams pioneered the use of multiple stroboscopes, slides and film projections simultaneously onstage during the 1966 Exploding Plastic Inevitable shows, and at Bill Graham's request, Williams built an enhanced <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>light</b> show to be used at Fillmore West.|$|R

40|$|A {{simple and}} versatile, but also {{sensitive}} and accurate method of determining vibration amplitudes is presented. The method consists of observing the slow motion of a moire pattern {{formed by the}} image of a signal grating projected on to an identical reference grating, illuminated by <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>light.</b> The pitch of the image of the signal grating can be suitably adjusted to yield an optimum relation between line frequencies of the two gratings.

40|$|International audienceElectrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD) is {{now used}} in {{numerous}} microsystems like digital lab-on-chips.

In the coplanar electrode configuration, two pairs of vortex flows are observed to form in a droplet centred on the electrode gap. All experiments are performed in oil as ambient phase and flows in the droplet are analysed using fluorescent beads. At the same time, droplet oscillations induced by AC EWOD are also revealed under <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>lighting.</b> These experiments show that vortex location can be controlled by frequency actuation with fair degree of reproducibility.

It has a reset button that sets the pitch adjustment to 0, regardless of the actual position of the pitch adjustment slider. In addition the M3D series has unique details: the brand and model label is printed in a single line instead of two; and the <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>light</b> is red with a slightly orange tone.

Nerve damage can be assessed by laryngoscopy, during which a <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>light</b> confirms the absence of movement in the affected side of the vocal cords. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve is more susceptible to damage during thyroid surgery because it {{is close to the}} bifurcation of the right inferior thyroid artery, variably passing in front of, behind, or between the branches.

30|$|Clinically, vocal cord {{function}} can {{be assessed}} by laryngoscopy, during which a <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>light</b> can confirm the absence of movement of the affected side. Symptoms of VCP include: hoarseness, vocal fatigue, loss of vocal pitch, shortness of breath and aspiration [2]. However, about 30 – 40  % of patients with unilateral VCP are asymptomatic [3, 4]. In these patients, presence of VCP is an incidental finding and the radiologist {{may be the first}} to report it. Due to the wide range of possible locations for lesions that can cause cord paralysis, it may be a first sign of extensive and severe pathology. Radiologists must therefore be able to recognise the imaging findings of VCP.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Virtual reality offers {{completely}} new possibilities for collaborative work over distributed environments. To enable collaborative work, {{it is necessary}} that both, virtual objects {{as well as the other}} users, can be seen simultaneously in real-time. A novel technique is necessary to overcome the contradiction of darkness and light for image projection and video acquisition, respectively. A <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>light</b> and a camera system are added to the existing VR-system and a few modification are made to existing shutter glasses. In such a solution, the method of projection in the VR-system remains unmodified. This paper describes how to resolve this contradiction with the constraint to make as few changes as possible to existing VR-systems. Furthermore the timing of the different devices is discussed. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect is}} most {{commonly}} demonstrated with a device known as Benham's top. It {{can also be}} seen in <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>lights</b> when flashes are set at certain critical speeds. Rotating fan blades, particularly aluminum ones, can also demonstrate the effect; as the fan accelerates or decelerates, the colors appear, drift, change and disappear. The stable running speed of the fan does not (normally) produce colors, suggesting that it is not an interference effect with the frequency of the illumination flicker.The effect was noted by Gustav Fechner and Hermann von Helmholtz and propagated to English-speakers through Charles Benham's invention of his top. The perceptual mechanism of Fechner color is not entirely understood. Florence Winger Bagley was one of the early investigators of this phenomenon.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the flexural strength of direct (Charisma) and indirect (Solidex) composites, {{with or without}} fiber reinforcements (Ribbond), cured with LED or <b>Stroboscopic</b> Xenon <b>Light.</b> MaterialandMethods: Resin bars made with or without fiber reinforcements, with 25 mm x 2 mm x 2 mm were distributed in groups (n= 10) : GDL– Direct Resin/LED; GDX–Direct Resin/Stroboscopic Xenon; GDFL– Direct Resin/Fiber/LED; GDFX– Direct Resin/Fiber/Stroboscopic Xenon; GIL– Indirect Resin/LED; GIX– Indirect Resin/Stroboscopic Xenon; GIFL– Indirect Resin/Fiber/LED; GIFX– Indirect Resin/Fiber/Stroboscopic Xenon. The specimens were connected to a universal test machine and submitted to a compression load (2 kN). Results: The obtained results were submitted to Analysis of Variance tests (p < 0. 01), and Tukey (5 % significance level) tests. The flexural strength of groups that used polyethylene fiber reinforcement (96. 39) was similar (p = 0. 58) to group without fiber reinforcement (92. 47). Direct composites (107. 79) showed higher values of flexural strength than indirect composites (81. 07), and <b>stroboscopic</b> xenon <b>light</b> curing (108. 71) resulted in better flexural strength results than LED (80. 15), for both kinds of composites experimented. Conclusion: The fiber reinforcement did not improve the composites’ flexural strength, direct composites showed higher flexural strength values, and <b>stroboscopic</b> xenon <b>light</b> showed better flexural strength results.

In this study, the acoustic emission measurement was adapted to monitor the crack initiation of the welded part during the fatigue test.

40|$|Anopheles pseudopunctipennis {{is one of}} {{the main}} malaria vectors in the Andean regions of South America. Few {{experimental}} data exist on this species because it is not very available in laboratories due to its eurygamic status that makes colony maintenance difficult.

However, this technique is time consuming, requires a well-trained technician, and is inadequate for easy mass production, which is sometimes necessary for certain experimental works. This study presents a technique based on exposure of adult mosquitoes to a blue <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>light</b> for 20 min during several nights, which encourages them to copulate naturally under laboratory conditions.

40|$|The {{reflected}} image moiré {{method was}} used to yield the vibration modes of plates. Interference of the reflection of a reference grating from the specularly polished surface of a vibrating plate with a second similar grating created a moiré pattern consisting of straight equidistant lines corresponding to the nodal regions of the plate. The moiré pattern produced when the plate was illuminated by a continuous parallel light beam yielded the nodal configuration of the vibrating plate. When the vibrating plate was illuminated by a <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>light</b> source the moiré pattern showed the contour map of partial slopes of the plate at the instant of illumination.

40|$|A {{technique}} using acousto-optic modulated partially incoherent stroboscopic imaging for {{measurement of}} in-plane motion of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) is presented. Vibration measurement is allowed by using flashes of the partially incoherent light source {{to freeze the}} positions of the microstructure at 12 equally spaced phases of the vibration period. The first-order diffracted beam taken out by an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) from the light beam of a laser is made partially incoherent by a rotating diffuser and then serves as the <b>stroboscopic</b> <b>light</b> source. Both the MEMS excitation signal and the flash control signal are provided by a dual-channel function generator. The main advantage of this measurement method is the absence of a stroboscopic generator and a high speed digital camera. Microscale prototypes are fabricated and tested. Quantitative estimates of the harmonic responses of the prototypes are obtained from the recorded images. The results agree with those obtained with a commercial MEMS motion analyzerTM with relative errors less than 2 %...|$|R
