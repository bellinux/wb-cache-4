2500|$|Because {{of the use}} of {{the word}} 'cyan' ( [...] , [...] ), which can also mean 'blue' in Greek, the exact <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> remains ambiguous. Although it implies the use <b>of</b> a light <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>blue,</b> such as on the flag of the United Nations, the colours of the Greek flag tend to be darker, {{especially}} during the dictatorship and in recent years, with the exception of the years of the rule of King Otto, when a very light <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> was used. Consequently, the <b>shade</b> <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> is largely left to the flagmakers to decide, as shown in the table below.|$|R

5|$|Throughout {{the history}} of fabric {{production}} natural dyes {{have been used to}} apply a form of colour, with dyes from plants, including indigo from Woad, having dozens of compounds whose proportions may vary according to soil type and climate; therefore giving rise to variations in shade. In the case of the Saltire, variations in <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> have resulted in the background of the flag ranging from sky blue to navy blue. When incorporated as part of the Union Flag during the 17th century, the dark blue applied to Union Flags destined for maritime use was possibly {{selected on the basis of}} the durability of darker dyes, with this dark blue shade eventually becoming standard on Union Flags both at sea and on land. Some flag manufacturers selected the same navy blue colour trend of the Union Flag for the Saltire itself, leading to a variety of <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>blue</b> being depicted on the flag of Scotland.|$|E
