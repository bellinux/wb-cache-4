These are now available as original equipment on some makes of dry suit. Silicone seals are hypoallergenic, but can not be glued to the suit, and must be attached using clip-on rings. The silicone seals are similar in mechanical strength to latex seals but do not deteriorate as rapidly from oxidation and chemical attack. They are initially relatively expensive, but can be replaced without tools by the user which reduces cost of replacement.|$|E

Although it was speculated that the Samsung version had worse battery performance than the TSMC version, multiple independent tests have shown there is no appreciable {{difference between the two}} chips. Although the device is not promoted as such, the iPhone 6S has a degree of water resistance because of a change to its internal design, which places a <b>silicone</b> <b>seal</b> around components of the logic board to prevent them from being shorted by accidental exposure to water.|$|E
30|$|A dense {{sampling}} {{campaign was}} undertaken {{at the peak}} of the dry season (January 2012) during which 72 water samples were collected from over 13 communities (Fig.  1). These included 32 open wells and 14 ‘boreholes’ hereafter termed groundwater, 14 streams, 4 rivers, 5 dam waters, and 3 lakes (Lakes Bambili, Oku and Ber) hereafter called surface water. Surface water sources were collected under base flow conditions (no run-off influence) since the sampling was in the dry season. The locations and altitudes of the selected sampling points were identified in the field using a Garmin Vista CX GPS. New narrow mouth low-density polyethylene bottles (100  ml) and Duran glass bottles (500  ml) were used for stable isotopes and tritium (3 H) water sampling, respectively. The glass bottles contained screw caps bonded with polytetrafluoroethylene-coated <b>silicone</b> <b>seal</b> liners. In order to avoid contamination, the bottles were properly rinsed with distilled water and dried in the Laboratory. Further details on water sampling are described in Wirmvem (2014). Unfiltered samples from 8 selected ‘boreholes’ (representing the entire study area) were pumped into the glass bottles using a peristaltic pump. The samples were properly capped immediately after sampling and well-preserved in a cooler container containing ice blocks prior to air-flight to Japan for analyses.|$|E

40|$|Chronic cranial windows {{have been}} {{instrumental}} in advancing optical studies in vivo, permitting long-term, high-resolution imaging in various brain regions. However, once a window is attached {{it is difficult to}} regain access to the brain under the window for cellular manipulations. Here we describe a simple device that combines long term in vivo optical imaging with direct brain access via glass or quartz pipettes and metal, glass, or quartz electrodes for cellular manipulations like dye or drug injections and electrophysiological stimulations or recordings while keeping the craniotomy sterile. Our device comprises a regular cranial window glass coverslip with a drilled access hole later sealed with biocompatible silicone. This chronic cranial window with access port is cheap, easy to manufacture, can be mounted just as the regular chronic cranial window, and is self-sealing after retraction of the pipette or electrode. We demonstrate that multiple injections can be performed through the silicone port by repetitively bolus loading calcium sensitive dye into mouse barrel cortex and recording spontaneous cellular activity over a period of weeks. As an example to the extent of its utility for electrophysiological recording, we describe how simple removal of the <b>silicone</b> <b>seal</b> can permit patch pipette access for whole-cell patch clamp recordings in vivo. During these chronic experiments we do not observe any infections under the window or impairment of animal health...|$|E
40|$|To {{successfully}} mate two pressurized vehicles or {{structures in}} space, advanced seals are required at the interface {{to prevent the}} loss of breathable air to the vacuum of space. A critical part of the development testing of candidate seal designs was a verification of {{the integrity of the}} retaining mechanism that holds the <b>silicone</b> <b>seal</b> component to the structure. Failure to retain the elastomer seal during flight could liberate seal material in the event of high adhesive loads during undocking. This work presents an investigation of the force required to separate the elastomer from its metal counter-face surface during simulated undocking as well as a comparison to that force which was necessary to destructively remove the elastomer from its retaining device. Two silicone elastomers, Wacker 007 - 49524 and Esterline ELASA- 401, were evaluated. During the course of the investigation, modifications were made to the retaining devices to determine if the modifications improved the force needed to destructively remove the seal. The tests were completed at the expected operating temperatures of - 50, + 23, and + 75 C. Under the conditions investigated, the comparison indicated that the adhesion between the elastomer and the metal counter-face was significantly less than the force needed to forcibly remove the elastomer seal from its retainer, and no failure would be expected...|$|E
40|$|Silicone {{rubber seals}} are being {{considered}} {{for a number of}} interfaces on NASA's Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV). Some of these joints include the docking system, hatches, and heat shield-to-back shell interface. A large diameter molded <b>silicone</b> <b>seal</b> is being developed for the Low Impact Docking System (LIDS) that forms an effective seal between the CEV and International Space Station (ISS) and other future Constellation Program spacecraft. Seals between the heat shield and back shell prevent high temperature reentry gases from leaking into the interface. Silicone rubber seals {{being considered for}} these locations have inherent adhesive tendencies that would result in excessive forces required to separate the joints if left unchecked. This paper summarizes adhesion assessments for both as-received and adhesion-mitigated seals for the docking system and the heat shield interface location. Three silicone elastomers were examined: Parker Hannifin S 0899 - 50 and S 0383 - 70 compounds, and Esterline ELA-SA- 401 compound. For the docking system application various levels of exposure to atomic oxygen (AO) were evaluated. Moderate AO treatments did not lower the adhesive properties of S 0899 - 50 sufficiently. However, AO pretreatments of approximately 10 (exp 20) atoms/sq cm did lower the adhesion of S 0383 - 70 and ELA-SA- 401 to acceptable levels. For the heat shield-to-back shell interface application, a fabric covering was also considered. Molding Nomex fabric into the heat shield pressure seal appreciably reduced seal adhesion for the heat shield-to-back shell interface application...|$|E

40|$|For {{long-term}} {{operation of}} fuel cells {{the stability of}} all components is needed under extreme conditions. Especially the components in polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) may show corrosion problems caused by the acid character of the solid electrolyte. One of the parts, which is commonly neglected, is the sealing material. Sealings are necessary for separating the gas compartments from the each other {{in order to avoid}} mixing of hydrogen and oxygen. A typical <b>sealing</b> material is <b>silicone.</b> Fuel cell components are characterized after operation in single cells under typical fuel cell conditions. After fuel cell operation frequently an alteration is visible on the sealing and the membrane parts which were in direct contact with each other. Those parts of the membrane, which were in contact with the sealing surface, became colored. Motivated by this observation membranes and sealings were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). In addition, electrodes and backings were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). With the XPS measurements of the electrodes operated in a <b>silicone</b> <b>sealed</b> cell, residues of the silicone were detected on its surface. This indicates that the decomposition products of the <b>silicone</b> <b>seals</b> have a high mobility. In SEM/EDX mappings, an enrichment of silicone residues on the platinum was observed. Therefore, the decomposition products may contribute to a poisoning of the catalysts and may also change the hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristic of the electrodes. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Vascular access {{care is a}} key {{topic for}} {{hemodialysis}} patients. The most cost-effective and lasting vascular access for chronic hemodialysis is the native arteriovenous fistula (AVF); however, bleeding after dialysis session from puncture site is a relevant problem. Achieving hemostasis is necessary and requires hand compression by the nurse or the patient {{if he or she}} is capable and cooperative. Methods: We assessed a new vascular closure device, VITACLIP (R) (Serumwerk Bernburg Vertriebs GmbH) that is an adhesive <b>silicone</b> <b>seal</b> device, which can be set onto the skin and punctured by dialysis needle. After withdrawal of the needle, VITACLIP (R) prevents bleeding from the punctured vessels, making hand compression unnecessary. Results: We used this device in 5 chronic hemodialysis patients with native lateral-terminal AVFs. The patients' hemodialysis prescription and anticoagulants dose were not changed. This device allowed puncture of vascular access without complications such as bleeding at the end of hemodialysis; we did not observe any mechanical complications due to needle dislocation or any dermatological lesions at skin puncture site. However, the cannulation proved to be more difficult for the nurses with this device because the silicone hampers identification of the vessel for puncture for deeper AVFs. Conclusions: This device helps patient management and improves patient safety by reducing the risk of AVF bleeding at the end of dialysis, decreasing the risk of staff contact with patients' blood, and theoretically eliminating the risk of massive bleeding in the case of an inadvertent needle dislodgement going unnoticed during treatment...|$|E
40|$|Joint leakage {{from low}} {{pressure}} natural gas distribution mains (typical value: 0. 25 ft[superscript 3] at 6 inwg gas pressure) is a persistent source of maintenance problems for utitlites. External encapsulation {{is the usual}} choice for repairing leaking joints. It is reliable and expensive, about $ 1000 per joint (80 % of which is for excavation and resurfacing). Consolidated Edison of New York is sponsoring a project to develop a cheap and reliable joint seal. No current sealing methods {{were found to be}} acceptable in Phase I. Adhesion failures between the seal and pipe were a major cause of seal failure. Preliminary Phase II research recommended the development of an internal mechanical seal. Such a seal would minimize excavation and eliminate adhesion failures. To complete Phase II, an internal mechanical seal was developed. The initial research indicated that cleaning of the pipe interior had to be minimized or eliminated. Testing demonstrated that a sealant, either asphalt or vulcanizing silicone, greatly enhanced the sealing of uncleaned pipes, while permitting low stress levels. This {{led to the development of}} a new internal mechanical seal concept for sealing uncleaned gas main joints. Joint tests of 2 injected <b>silicone</b> <b>seal</b> concepts were run. The Type 1 seal, which filled the joint recess, completely sealed an uncleaned pipe joint. The Type 2 seal, which spanned the joint recess with an elastomeric bridge, had a leak rate of 0. 000038 ft[superscript 3]/hr at 6 inwg gas pressure from an uncleaned joint. The leakage was caused by permiability of the silicone bridge. These flexible and compliant seals, clamped in place with retaining bands, provide mechanical support for the sealant throughout the seal life, and thus do not rely on adhesion...|$|E
40|$|While {{in space}} {{silicone}} based elastomer seals planned {{for use on}} NASA's Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) are exposed to threats from micrometeoroids and orbital debris (MMOD). An understanding of these threats is required to assess risks to the crew, the CEV orbiter, and missions. An Earth based campaign of hypervelocity impacts on small scale seal rings {{has been done to}} help estimate MMOD threats to the primary docking seal being developed for the Low Impact Docking System (LIDS). LIDS is being developed to enable the CEV to dock to the ISS (International Space Station) or to Altair (NASA's next lunar lander). The <b>silicone</b> <b>seal</b> on LIDS seals against aluminum alloy flanges on ISS or Altair. Since the integrity of a seal depends on both sealing surfaces, aluminum targets were also impacted. The variables considered in this study included projectile mass, density, speed, incidence angle, seal materials, and target surface treatments and coatings. Most of the impacts used a velocity near 8 km/s and spherical aluminum projectiles (density = 2. 7 g/cubic centimeter), however, a few tests were done near 5. 6 km/s. Tests were also performed using projectile densities of 7. 7, 2. 79, 2. 5 or 1. 14 g/cubic centimeter. Projectile incidence angles examined included 0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 60 degrees from normal to the plane of the target. Elastomer compounds impacted include Parker's S 0383 - 70 and Esterline's ELA-SA- 401 in the as received condition, or after an atomic oxygen treatment. Bare, anodized and nickel coated aluminum targets were tested simulating the candidate mating seal surface materials. After impact, seals and aluminum plates were leak tested: damaged seals were tested against an undamaged aluminum plate; and undamaged seals were placed at various locations over craters in aluminum plates. It has been shown that silicone elastomer seals can withstand an impressive level of damage before leaking beyond allowable limits. In general on the tests performed to date, the diameter of the crater in either the elastomer, or the aluminum, must be at least as big as 80 % to 90 % of width of the bulb of the seal before significant leakage occurs...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} novel processing {{routes that}} have been developed to fabricate neural interfaces. A process has been investigated that uses microfabrication techniques to fabricate a multi-channel regenerative implant that can record nerve impulses in the peripheral nervous system (PNS), called the Spiral Peripheral Nerve Interface (SPNI). It is shown both theoretically and experimentally that the implant improves the ability to record signals in the PNS via micro-channels that act as axonal amplifiers. New processing routes are introduced to create robust interconnections from the SPNI to external electronics via ‘Microflex’ technology. To incorporate the new interconnection technology the SPNI had to be modified. During this modification the strain in the device was given specific consideration, for which a new bending model is presented. Modelling is used to show that electrochemical impedance spectroscopy can be used to assess the quality of the fabrication process. Electrochemical and mechanical tests show that the interconnection technology is suitable for a neural interfaces but the fabrication of perfectly sealed micro-channels was not evident.
