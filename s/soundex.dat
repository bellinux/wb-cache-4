2500|$|Open records: Movements {{to unseal}} {{adoption}} records for adopted citizens proliferated along with increased acceptance of illegitimacy. In the United States, Jean Paton founded Orphan Voyage in 1954, and Florence Fisher founded the Adoptees' Liberty Movement Association (ALMA) in 1971, calling sealed records [...] "an affront to human dignity.". While in 1975, Emma May Vilardi {{created the first}} mutual-consent registry, the International <b>Soundex</b> Reunion Registry (ISRR), allowing those separated by adoption to locate one another. and Lee Campbell and other birthmothers established CUB (Concerned United Birthparents). Similar ideas were taking hold globally with grass-roots organizations like Parent Finders in Canada and Jigsaw in Australia. In 1975, England and Wales opened records on moral grounds.|$|E
40|$|Four {{years after}} the {{occurrence}} of an outbreak of hepatitis B and HIV infection among injecting drug user inmates at Her Majesty's Prison Glenochil in Scotland, a study design was developed to complete the epidemiological account of the HIV outbreak. Our aim was to identify potential cases of (1) HIV transmission not diagnosed during the original outbreak investigation and (2) the source(s) of the outbreak. Scotland's HIV positive case register was searched for matches to a <b>soundexed</b> list of 636 Glenochil inmates imprisoned during January-June 1993. Eight HIV infections {{that may have been}} acquired in Glenochil and four possible sources of the outbreak were identified. The second stage of follow-up molecular epidemiological techniques used on stored sera samples from identified individuals is described in the companion paper. Without breach of medical or prisoner confidentiality, indirect and anonymous follow-up has proved possible for the Glenochil inmates...|$|R
5000|$|Daitch-Mokotoff <b>Soundex,</b> {{which is}} a {{refinement}} of <b>Soundex</b> designed to better match surnames of Slavic and Germanic origin. Daitch-Mokotoff <b>Soundex</b> codes are strings composed of six numeric digits.|$|E
5000|$|Daitch-Mokotoff <b>Soundex</b> (D-M <b>Soundex)</b> was {{developed}} in 1985 by genealogist Gary Mokotoff and later improved by genealogist Randy Daitch because of problems they encountered while trying to apply the Russell <b>Soundex</b> to Jews with Germanic or Slavic surnames (such as Moskowitz vs. Moskovitz or Levine vs. Lewin). D-M <b>Soundex</b> is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "Jewish Soundex" [...] or [...] "Eastern European Soundex", although the authors discourage the use of those names. The D-M <b>Soundex</b> algorithm can return as many as 32 individual phonetic encodings for a single name. Results of D-M <b>Soundex</b> are returned in an all-numeric format between 100000 and 999999. This algorithm is much more complex than Russell <b>Soundex.</b>|$|E
50|$|Daitch-Mokotoff <b>Soundex</b> (D-M <b>Soundex)</b> is a phonetic {{algorithm}} {{invented in}} 1985 by Jewish genealogists Gary Mokotoff and Randy Daitch. It is a refinement of the Russell and American <b>Soundex</b> algorithms {{designed to allow}} greater accuracy in matching of Slavic and Yiddish surnames with similar pronunciation but differences in spelling.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Soundex,</b> {{which was}} {{developed}} to encode surnames for use in censuses. <b>Soundex</b> codes are four-character strings composed of a single letter followed by three numbers.|$|E
50|$|To {{address the}} large number of false {{positive}} results generated by the D-M <b>Soundex,</b> Stephen P. Morse and Alexander Beider created the Beider-Morse Phonetic Name Matching algorithm. This new algorithm cuts down on false positives at the expense of some false negatives. A number of sites are offering the B-M <b>soundex</b> in addition to the D-M <b>soundex.</b>|$|E
50|$|The New York State Identification and Intelligence System (NYSIIS) {{algorithm}} {{was introduced}} in 1970 as an improvement to the <b>Soundex</b> algorithm. NYSIIS handles some multi-character n-grams and maintains relative vowel positioning, whereas <b>Soundex</b> does not.|$|E
50|$|<b>Soundex</b> was {{developed}} by Robert C. Russell and Margaret King Odell and patented in 1918 and 1922. A variation, American <b>Soundex,</b> {{was used in the}} 1930s for a retrospective analysis of the US censuses from 1890 through 1920. The <b>Soundex</b> code came to prominence in the 1960s when it was the subject of several articles in the Communications and Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery, and especially when described in Donald Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming.|$|E
5000|$|Search {{functionality}} {{will often}} use phonetic algorithms to find results that don't match exactly the term(s) {{used in the}} search. Searching for names can be difficult as there are often multiple alternative spellings for names. An example is the name [...] It has two alternatives, Clare/Clair, which are both pronounced the same. Searching for one spelling wouldn't show results for the two others. Using <b>Soundex</b> all three variations produce the same <b>Soundex</b> code, C460. By searching names based on the <b>Soundex</b> code all three variations will be returned.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Soundex</b> is a phonetic {{algorithm}} for indexing names by sound, as {{pronounced in}} English. The goal is for homophones to be encoded {{to the same}} representation {{so that they can}} be matched despite minor differences in spelling. The algorithm mainly encodes consonants; a vowel will not be encoded unless it is the first letter. <b>Soundex</b> is the most widely known of all phonetic algorithms (in part because it is a standard feature of popular database software such as DB2, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Ingres, MS SQL Server and Oracle) and is often used (incorrectly) as a synonym for [...] "phonetic algorithm". Improvements to <b>Soundex</b> are the basis for many modern phonetic algorithms.|$|E

50|$|Metaphone is a phonetic algorithm, {{published}} by Lawrence Philips in 1990, for indexing words by their English pronunciation. It fundamentally improves on the <b>Soundex</b> algorithm by using information about variations and inconsistencies in English spelling and pronunciation {{to produce a}} more accurate encoding, which does {{a better job of}} matching words and names which sound similar. As with <b>Soundex,</b> similar-sounding words should share the same keys. Metaphone is available as a built-in operator in a number of systems.|$|E

50|$|Ivor Tiefenbrun {{has talked}} about how Sondek derives from the word <b>Soundex</b> as each hi-fi design always ends up having its own unique {{identifiable}} and recognisable sound. Some report the original name was just Sondek without the LP12.|$|E
50|$|Recognizing {{that there}} were many {{spelling}} variants of Eastern European Jewish surnames, even though they sounded similar, Mokotoff collaborated with Randy Daitch to create the Daitch-Mokotoff <b>Soundex,</b> system which provides a phonetic alternative to searching databases of names.|$|E

5000|$|It {{should be}} noted that the two {{algorithms}} above do not return the same results in all cases primarily because of the difference between when the vowels are removed. The first algorithm is used by SQL and the second is used by most programming language libraries. As an example given the surname [...] "Honeyman" [...] the first algorithm returns [...] "H500" [...] while the second algorithm returns [...] "H555". In designing an application which combines SQL and a programming language the architect must decide whether to do all of the <b>Soundex</b> encoding in the SQL server or all in the programming language. Also the MySQL implementation of the <b>Soundex</b> algorithm can return more than 4 characters.|$|E
50|$|Comprehensive {{indexing}} is {{the real}} value of a biographical registry. The names themselves are a challenge, with phonetic variations and aliases. <b>Soundex</b> is one technique for indexing names such that phonetic equivalents, with variations in transliterations into the local language, can be retrieved.|$|E
5000|$|The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) {{maintains}} the current rule {{set for the}} official implementation of <b>Soundex</b> used by the U.S. Government.

50|$|While {{there is}} no truly general solution, there has been {{considerable}} work in both in transliteration nonroman character sets. <b>Soundex</b> and related systems help search biographical databases by phonetics, but transliterated character sets allow people not fully fluent in the written language to search for names.|$|E

5000|$|Daitch-Mokotoff <b>Soundex</b> is {{sometimes}} referred to as [...] "Jewish Soundex" [...] and [...] "Eastern European Soundex", although the authors discourage use of these nicknames for the algorithm because the algorithm itself is independent of the fact the motivation for creating the new system was the poor results of predecessor systems when dealing with Slavic and Yiddish surnames.|$|E
