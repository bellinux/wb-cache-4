25|$|An insulated-gate bipolar {{transistor}} (IGBT) is a three-terminal {{power semiconductor device}} primarily used as an electronic switch which, as it was developed, came to combine high efficiency and fast switching. It switches electric power in many applications: variable-frequency drives (VFDs), electric cars, trains, variable <b>speed</b> refrigerators, <b>lamp</b> ballasts, air-conditioners and even stereo systems with switching amplifiers. The IGBT is a semiconductor device with four alternating layers (P-N-P-N) that are controlled by a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) gate structure without regenerative action.|$|R
40|$|Reply to Goyal et al TO THE EDITOR—Goyal et al [1] provide {{additional}} useful {{commentary on the}} article by Patel et al, which investigates the usefulness of real-time fluorescence loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for point-of-care testing for ma-laria [2, 3]. We agree on the issues raised regarding laboratory infrastructure re-quirements and precautions necessary to prevent contamination. However, specific needs for manual or automated DNA extraction and amplification will vary ac-cording to the volume of samples being processed, costs, and the technical capac-ity of the laboratory. Also, while currently available LAMP technologies require con-ditions that preclude its use in the most remote settings, the ease of use and <b>speed</b> of <b>LAMP</b> have allowed point-of-care test-ing in settings where it was previously not available.

When the system was activated, an indicator light reflected the suspension setting selected.The system components consisted of a control switch, indicator light, four shock absorbers, shock absorber control actuator, shock absorber control computer, vehicle <b>speed</b> sensor, stop <b>lamp</b> switch, with a throttle position sensor and {{a steering angle sensor}} on TEMS three stage systems only.|$|R
50|$|Switching high-intensity {{incandescent}} (filament) lamps to {{full power}} from cold can shorten their life dramatically, {{owing to the}} large inrush current that occurs. To reduce stress on the lamp filaments, dimmers may have a preheat function. This sets a minimum level, usually between 5% and 10%, which appears turned-off, but stops the lamp from cooling down too much. This also <b>speeds</b> up the <b>lamp's</b> reaction to sudden bursts of power that operators of rock'n'roll-style shows appreciate. The opposite of this function is sometimes called top-set. This limits the maximum power supplied to a lamp, which can also extend its life.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a rapid, sensitive detection assay for the quarantine pathogen Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni, causal agent of stone fruit bacterial spot, an economically important disease of Prunus spp. Unique targets were identified from X. arboricola pv. pruni genomes using a comparative genomics pipeline of other Xanthomonas species, subspecies and pathovars, and used to identify specific diagnostic markers. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was then applied to these markers to provide rapid, sensitive and specific detection. The method developed showed unrivalled specificity with the 79 tested strains and, in contrast to previously established techniques, distinguished between phylogenetically close subspecies such as X. arboricola pv. corylina. The sensitivity of this test is comparable to that of a previously reported TaqMan™ assay at 103 CFU mL− 1, while the unrivalled <b>speed</b> of <b>LAMP</b> technology enables a positive result to be obtained in < 15 min. The developed assay can be used with real-time fluorescent detectors for quantitative results as well as with DNA-staining dyes to function as a simplified strategy for on-site pathogen detection...|$|R

The train is the first train of Northern Railway zone to be operated on German Technology LHB Coaches from 12 April 2016. Lucknow-New Delhi AC Express (12429/12430) can now accommodate 960 passengers instead of 824. The number of seats in AC-2 coaches has been increased from 44 to 52, while in AC-3 coaches it has been raised from 64 to 72. The new coaches, based on a German technology Linke Hoffman Busch (LHB), are made of stainless steel which do not turn turtle during accidents. The light-weight coaches will also improve the train's <b>speed.</b> Bigger windows, <b>lamps</b> at all seats and sound insulation are the other features.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{quantify}} the claimed differences between mobile and static lighting, and to clarify the mechanisms causing these differences, an experiment with rose `First Red¿ was carried out. In a greenhouse compartment half of the area was equipped with mobile lamps, {{and the other half}} with static lamps. By mounting the lamps in the centre of the greenhouse, a light gradient was achieved in both treatments. Experimental plots were chosen with daily light integrals of 1 to 3 and 3 to 5 mol m- 2 day- 1 respectively. A `traditional¿ and a `synchronous¿ (production in flushes) crop were grown. Production and photosynthetic characteristics were measured during the winter season 2003 ¿ 2004. Photosynthetic characteristics were measured in the synchronous crop. With the INTKAM simulation model for rose, production under diverse mobile lighting regimes was predicted. Fresh weight production over the experimental period was higher in the static-light treatment than in the mobile-light treatment for both the traditional as well as the synchronous crop. This was caused by a lower number of stems per plant and a slightly lower weight per stem under mobile lighting. Length of stems was not affected. The light response curves for leaves did not differ between the treatments. Also, the induction of photosynthesis after a simulated light pulse in a cuvette was the same for both treatments. Simulation of the growth of the synchronous crop showed that a different <b>lamp</b> <b>speed</b> or a combination of fixed and moving lamps confirmed the conclusion that mobile lighting did not lead to increased production in comparison with static lighting at similar daily amounts of lamplight...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{the markets}} for {{electronic}} products are changing {{at a rapid}} pace. As such, companies {{have been forced to}} employ strategic means to handle the ever-changing market dynamics. In order to solve this issue, in the last decades, new product development has grown in popularity in the academic world. The time between the inception of product idea and its transition is the new product development cycle time. New product development (NPD) speed is critical because product life cycles are shrinking and obsolescence is occurring more quickly than in the past (Sherman et al., 2000). A review of the specialized new product development literature (Langerak and Hultink, 2005; 2006; 2008) and a consultation with an Innovation Manager expert revealed the existence of eleven acceleration approaches that can enhance new product development speed and profitability, and subsequently improve the firm‟s financial performance. Under these circumstances, Royal Philips Electronics, like any other large electronics company, is facing a changing environment and the need to accelerate the NPD process {{in order to be able}} to outperform their competition and stay number one in the market. Based on the above, Philips assigned a specialized committee to address their slowdown in LED Lamps development processes, identifying non-desirable bottlenecks. Consequently, a functional team with business leaders in the lead was assigned to find a way to remove the bottlenecks. Thus, a comparison between current Philips methods and literature methods will be carried out. As such, the harmful bottlenecks will serve as a basis for the development of practical guidelines by implementing acceleration techniques within Philips‟ scope to <b>speed</b> up LED <b>Lamps</b> NPD process...|$|R
