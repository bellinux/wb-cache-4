5|$|The term Commission is used {{either in}} the narrow <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 28-member College of Commissioners (or College) or to also include the {{administrative}} body of about 23,000 European civil servants who are split into departments called directorates-general and services.

5|$|The term hatt-ı hümayun is {{occasionally}} used in {{the literal}} <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> handwriting of the Sultan.

The whole poem is a compliment to {{the writings of the}} Sultan.|$|E
5|$|Two 20th century {{developments}} in geology {{had a big}} effect on paleontology.

5|$|Before {{his final}} {{undergraduate}} year at McMaster, Innis spent a summer {{teaching at the}} Northern Star School in the frontier farming community of Landonville near Vermilion, Alberta. The experience gave him a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vastness of Canada. He also learned about Western grievances over high interest rates and steep transportation costs. In his final undergraduate year, Innis focused on history and economics. He kept in mind a remark made by history lecturer W.S. Wallace that the economic interpretation of history {{was not the only}} possible one, but that it went the deepest.|$|E
5|$|Chapman {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{football}} managers in the modern <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> word, taking full charge of the team, rather than letting board members pick the side. As well as his tactical innovations, he was also a strong believer in physical fitness in football – he instituted a strict training regime and the use of physiotherapists and masseurs. He encouraged his players to openly discuss tactics and the game, instituting weekly team meetings at his clubs, and encouraged them to socialise in extra-curricular activities such as golf. He wrote regularly on football for the Sunday Express newspaper, and a collection of his writings was published after his death in a book, entitled Herbert Chapman on Football.|$|E
5|$|Christian philosopher John Hick {{believed}} that {{the language of the}} Bible should be demythologised to be compatible with naturalism. He offered a demythologised Christology, arguing that Jesus was not God incarnate, but a man with incredible experience of divine reality. To Hick, calling Jesus the Son of God was a metaphor used by Jesus' followers to describe their commitment to what Jesus represented. Hick {{believed that}} demythologising the incarnation would make <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variety of world religions and give them equal validity as ways to encounter God.|$|E

5|$|English pronouns {{conserve}} many {{traits of}} case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain {{a difference between}} subjective and objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) {{as well as a}} gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing he/she/it). The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used both in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous accusative case (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and in the <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb). Subjective case is used when the pronoun {{is the subject of a}} finite clause, and otherwise the objective case is used. While grammarians such as Henry Sweet and Otto Jespersen noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example , retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.|$|E
5|$|FBI {{director}} J. Edgar Hoover designed President Truman's loyalty-security program, and its background {{investigations of}} employees {{were carried out}} by FBI agents. This was a major assignment {{that led to the}} number of agents in the Bureau being increased from 3,559 in 1946 to 7,029 in 1952. Hoover's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Communist threat and the standards of evidence applied by his bureau resulted in thousands of government workers losing their jobs. Due to Hoover's insistence upon keeping the identity of his informers secret, most subjects of loyalty-security reviews were not allowed to cross-examine or know the identities of those who accused them. In many cases they were not even told what they were accused of.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Liliʻuokalani {{brought an}} {{unsuccessful}} {{lawsuit against the}} United States under the Fifth Amendment seeking {{the return of the}} Hawaiian Crown Lands. The US courts invoked an 1864 Kingdom Supreme Court decision over a case involving the Dowager Queen Emma and Kamehameha V, using it against her. In this decision the courts found that the Crown Lands were not necessarily the private possession of the monarch in the strictest <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term.|$|E

5|$|Ireland {{remained}} {{ruled by}} native kings into the 12th century, largely {{without the use}} of castles. There was a history of Irish fortifications called ráths, a type of ringfort, some of which were very heavily defended but which are not usually considered to be castles in the usual <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> word. The kings of Connacht constructed fortifications from 1124 which they called caistel or caislen, from the Latin and French for castle, and there has been considerable academic debate over how far these resembled European castles.|$|E
5|$|It is {{unnecessary}} to add, {{that it was}} instantly afforded. He recovered; and, when discharged from the hospital, signified his desired {{to return to his}} corps to combat us again: exhibiting thus, through the whole, a strong <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> value of generosity and courtesy in warfare, and also of his duty to his country,– separating completely in his own mind private and national feelings from each other,– and his frank confidence in the individuals of our nation, from the duty he owed his own, to fight against us collectively.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Del Arco had {{no concept}} of what a Borg was prior to the audition. He {{received}} his script on the evening prior to meeting with the producers and felt that {{it gave him a}} decent <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> character. Instead, Del Arco later explained that he was deliberately anti-social towards the other actors at the audition in order to get into Hugh's mindset. When he performed for the producers, someone else read the lines assigned to Picard and La Forge, and he felt like he immediately got a positive result. He received a call back, and returned to audition once more.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{evolutionary}} theory continues to develop. Darwin's {{theory of evolution}} by natural selection, with its tree-like model of branching common descent, has become the unifying theory of the life sciences. The theory explains the diversity of living organisms and their adaptation to the environment. It makes <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geologic record, biogeography, parallels in embryonic development, biological homologies, vestigiality, cladistics, phylogenetics and other fields, with unrivalled explanatory power; it has also become essential to applied sciences such as medicine and agriculture. Despite the scientific consensus, a religion-based political controversy has developed over how evolution is taught in schools, especially in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Modern scholarship, {{noting the}} way in which similar {{accounts}} were associated in ancient times with the deaths of notable figures, sees the phenomenon as a literary invention that attempts to convey a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power of Jesus in the face of death, or a sign of God's displeasure with the Jewish people. Scholars have also noted the ways in which this episode appears to draw on earlier biblical accounts of darkness from the Old Testament.|$|E
