50|$|The {{basic unit}} of framing in SDH is a STM-1 (Synchronous Transport Module, level 1), which {{operates}} at 155.520 {{megabits per second}} (Mbit/s). SONET refers to this basic unit as an STS-3c (<b>Synchronous</b> <b>Transport</b> <b>Signal</b> 3, concatenated). When the STS-3c is carried over OC-3, it is often colloquially referred to as OC-3c, {{but this is not}} an official designation within the SONET standard as there is no physical layer (i.e. optical) difference between an STS-3c and 3 STS-1s carried within an OC-3.|$|E
50|$|SONET {{offers an}} {{additional}} basic unit of transmission, the STS-1 (<b>Synchronous</b> <b>Transport</b> <b>Signal</b> 1) or OC-1, operating at 51.84 Mbit/s—exactly {{one third of}} an STM-1/STS-3c/OC-3c carrier. This speed is dictated by the bandwidth requirements for PCM-encoded telephonic voice signals: at this rate, an STS-1/OC-1 circuit can carry the bandwidth equivalent of a standard DS-3 channel, which can carry 672 64-kbit/s voice channels. In SONET, the STS-3c signal is composed of three multiplexed STS-1 signals; the STS-3c may be carried on an OC-3 signal. Some manufacturers also support the SDH equivalent of the STS-1/OC-1, known as STM-0.|$|E
40|$|One of {{important}} transmission technologies in the broadband ISDN is the synchronous transmission technology based on SDH, a key concept of SONET/SDH is the pointer-based {{access to the}} encapsulated payloads in theSONET/SDH signal. The Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) and the Synchronous Optical NETwork (SONET) are hierarchies used in Europe/South-America and NorthAmerica/Japan, respectively. Both systems employ {{synchronous time division multiplexing}} techniques to transmit different tributaries (EI, Ethernet, ATM, etc) through the same physical channel. A primary goal {{in the development of the}} SDH/SONET formats is to define a synchronous optical hierarchy with sufficient flexibility to carry payloads of different types. SONET and SDH are based on transmission at rates that are integer multiples of 51. 840 Mbps. SONET basic frame structure is called <b>synchronous</b> <b>transport</b> <b>signal</b> level one (STS-l). SDH basic modular signal is called synchronous transport module level one (STM-I). The STM-I rate is an extension of the basic STS-I (for this reason also called STM-O) and operates at 155. 52 Mbps, carrying three interleaved STS-l frames...|$|E

40|$|The {{transport}} of proteins into the nucleus requires {{not only the}} presence of a nuclear <b>transport</b> <b>signal</b> on the targeted protein but also the signal recognition proteins and the nuclear pore translocation apparatus. Complicating the search for the signal recognition proteins {{is the fact that the}} nuclear <b>transport</b> <b>signals</b> identified share little obvious homology. In this study, synthetic peptides homologous to the nuclear <b>transport</b> <b>signals</b> from the simian virus 40 large T antigen, Xenopus oocyte nucleoplasmin, adenovirus E 1 A, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae MAT alpha 2 proteins were coupled to a UV-photoactivable cross-linker and iodinated for use in an in vitro cross-linking reaction with cellular lysates. Four proteins, p 140, p 100, p 70, and p 55, which specifically interacted with the nuclear <b>transport</b> <b>signal</b> peptides were identified. Unique patterns of reactivity were observed with closely related pairs of nuclear <b>transport</b> <b>signal</b> peptides. Competition experiments with labeled and unlabeled peptides demonstrated that heterologous signals were able to bind the same protein and suggested that diverse signals use a common transport pathway.

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{possibility}} of active recycling of Emp 24 p between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi, we sought to identify <b>transport</b> <b>signal(s)</b> in the carboxyl-terminal region of Emp 24 p. Reporter molecules were constructed by replacing parts of a control invertase-Wbp 1 p chimera with those of Emp 24 p, and their transport rates were assessed. The transport of the reporter {{was found to be}} accelerated by the presence of the cytoplasmic domain of Emp 24 p. Mutational analyses revealed that the two carboxyl-terminal residues, leucine and valine (LV), were necessary and sufficient to accelerate the transport. The acceleration was sequence specific, and the terminal valine appeared to be more important. The LV residues accelerated not only the overall transport to the vacuole but also the ER to cis-Golgi transport, suggesting its function in the ER export. Hence the LV residues are a novel anterograde <b>transport</b> <b>signal.</b> The double-phenylalanine residues did not affect the transport by itself but attenuated the effect of the anterograde <b>transport</b> <b>signal.</b> On the other hand, the transmembrane domain significantly slowed down the ER to cis-Golgi transport and effectively counteracted the anterograde <b>transport</b> <b>signal</b> at this step. It may also take part in the retrieval of the protein, because the overall transport to the vacuole was more evidently slowed down. Consistently, the mutation of a conserved glutamine residue in the transmembrane domain further slowed down the transport in a step after arriving at the cis-Golgi. Taken together, the existence of the anterograde <b>transport</b> <b>signal</b> and the elements that regulate its function support the active recycling of Emp 24 p...|$|R

30|$|The most {{straightforward}} {{hybrid architecture}} envisaged {{is based upon}} a high-speed forward link using a broadcast lower satellite, whereas the return link takes benefit of the already existing, high bandwidth network architectures such as the <b>synchronous</b> <b>transport</b> module connections. This also enables the seamless migration of broadband satellite constellation systems providing triple-play services into hybrid systems. Such hybrid systems already exist. One can quote, for instance, that the AstraNet system providing IP telecommunication services uses an ASTRA satellite in the forward link and a terrestrial telephone line in the return link. Satellite/terrestrial LTE networks are integrated for IP services delivery, for instance, in the SkyTerra/LightSquared with LTE/satellite network system [8].|$|R
50|$|The <b>Synchronous</b> <b>Transport</b> Module, level 1 (STM-1) {{frame is}} the basic {{transmission}} format for SDH—the first level of the synchronous digital hierarchy. The STM-1 frame is transmitted in exactly 125 µs, therefore, there are 8,000 frames per second on a 155.52 Mbit/s OC-3 fiber-optic circuit. The STM-1 frame consists of overhead and pointers plus information payload. The first nine columns of each frame make up the section overhead and administrative unit pointers, and the last 261 columns make up the information payload. The pointers (H1, H2, H3 bytes) identify administrative units (AU) within the information payload. Thus, an OC-3 circuit can carry 150.336 Mbit/s of payload, after accounting for the overhead.|$|R

40|$|ChiA, an 88 -kDa endochitinase encoded by the chiA gene of the gram-negative enteropathogen Vibrio cholerae, is {{secreted}} via the eps-encoded {{main terminal}} {{branch of the}} general secretory pathway (GSP), a mechanism which also transports cholera toxin. To localize the extracellular <b>transport</b> <b>signal</b> of ChiA that initiates transport of the protein through the GSP, a chimera comprised of ChiA fused at the N terminus with the maltose-binding protein (MalE) of Escherichia coli and fused at the C terminus with a 13 -amino-acid epitope tag (E-tag) was expressed in strain 569 B(chiA::Kanr), a chiA-deficient but secretion-competent mutant of V. cholerae. Fractionation studies revealed that blockage of the natural N terminus and C terminus of ChiA did not prevent secretion of the MalE-ChiA-E-tag chimera. To locate the amino acid sequences which encoded the <b>transport</b> <b>signal,</b> a series of truncations of ChiA were engineered. Secretion of the mutant polypeptides was curtailed only when ChiA was deleted from the N terminus beyond amino acid position 75 or from the C terminus beyond amino acid 555. A mutant ChiA comprised of only those amino acids was secreted by wild-type V. cholerae but not by an epsD mutant, establishing that amino acids 75 to 555 independently harbored sufficient structural information to promote secretion by the GSP of V. cholerae. Cys 77 and Cys 537, two cysteines located just within the termini of ChiA(75 - 555), were not required for secretion, indicating that those residues were not essential for maintaining the functional activity of the ChiA extracellular <b>transport</b> <b>signal...</b>|$|R
40|$|Several human {{pathogens}} and {{the plant}} pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens use a type IV secretion system for translocation of effector proteins into host cells. How effector proteins are selected for transport is unknown, but a C-terminal <b>transport</b> <b>signal</b> {{is present in the}} proteins translocated by the A. tumefaciens VirB/D 4 type IV secretion system. We characterized this signal in the virulence protein VirF by alanine scanning and further site-directed mutagenesis. The Cre recombinase was used as a reporter to measure the translocation efficiency of Cre-Vir fusions from A. tumefaciens to Arabidopsis. The data unambiguously showed that positive charge is an essential characteristic of the C-terminal <b>transport</b> <b>signal.</b> We increased the sensitivity of this translocation assay by modifying the Cre-induced readout in host cells from kanamycin resistance to GFP expression. This improvement allowed us to detect translocation of the VirD 2 relaxase protein in the absence of transferred DNA, showing that attachment to the transferred DNA is not essential for transport by the VirB/D 4 system. We also found another translocated effector protein, namely the VirD 5 protein encoded by the tumor-inducing plasmid. According to secondary structure predictions, the C termini of all VirB/D 4 -translocated proteins identified so far are unstructured; however, they contain a characteristic hydropathic profile. Based on sequence alignments and mutational analysis of VirF, we conclude that the C-terminal <b>transport</b> <b>signal</b> for recruitment and translocation of effector proteins by the A. tumefaciens VirB/D 4 system is hydrophilic and has a net positive charge with a consensus motif of R-X(7) -R-X-R-X-R-X-X(n) >...|$|R

Previous studies indicated the presence of signals in the CRAM C terminus, specific for its localization to the FP and for efficient endocytosis (H. Yang, D. G. Russell, B. Zeng, M. Eiki, and M. G. -S. Lee, Mol. Cell. Biol. 20 : 5149 - 5163, 2000.) To delineate functional domains of putative sorting signals, we performed a mutagenesis series of the CRAM C terminus. Subcellular localization of CRAM mutants demonstrated that the amino acid sequence between − 5 and − 14 (referred to as a <b>transport</b> <b>signal)</b> is essential for exporting CRAM from the endoplasmic reticulum to the FP, and mutations of amino acids at − 12 (V), − 10 (V), or − 5 (D) led to retention of CRAM in the endoplasmic reticulum. Comparison of the endocytosis efficiency of CRAM mutants demonstrated that the sequence from amino acid − 5 to − 23 (referred to as a putative endocytosis signal) is required for efficient endocytosis and overlaps with the <b>transport</b> <b>signal.</b> Apparently the CRAM-derived sorting signal can efficiently interact with the T. brucei μ 1 adaptin, and mutations at amino acids essential for the function of the <b>transport</b> <b>signal</b> abolished the interaction of the signal with T. brucei μ 1, strengthening the hypothesis of the involvement of the clathrin- and adaptor-dependent pathway in trafficking of CRAM via the FP...|$|R
