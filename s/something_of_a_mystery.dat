5|$|There are {{the remains}} of various broch towers in {{southern}} Scotland that appear to date from the period immediately prior to or following Agricola's invasion. They are about fifteen in number and are found in four locations: the Forth valley, close to the Firth of Tay, the far south-west and the eastern Borders. Their existence {{so far from the}} main centres of broch-building is <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery.</b> The destruction of the Leckie broch may have come {{at the hands of the}} Roman invaders, yet like the nearby site of Fairy Knowe at Buchlyvie a substantial amount of both Roman and native artefacts have been recovered there. Both structures were built in the late 1st century and were evidently high-status buildings. The inhabitants raised sheep, cattle and pigs, and benefited from a range of wild game including Red Deer and Wild Boar.|$|E
25|$|A {{controversy}} over the assortment of operation theories {{dates back to the}} 18th century, when Benjamin Franklin himself stated that his lightning protectors protected buildings by dissipating electric charge.

25|$|Jade : is {{the most}} common material, and is {{associated}} with the most common, least powerful of the Exalted, the Terrestrial Exalted. There are six different colors of jade, five of which correspond to one of the Elemental Dragons. Blue jade resonates with Air, white with Earth, black with Water, green with Wood, and red with Fire. The sixth, yellow jade, is <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery,</b> in that it should not exist and only comes about through alchemical mistakes. Jade weapons are unnaturally fast, and jade armor doesn't tire the wearer.|$|E

Homolka, reported one, [...] "remains <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> diagnostic <b>mystery.</b> Despite her ability to present herself very well, there is a moral vacuity in her which is difficult, if not impossible, to explain." [...] As Homolka proceeded through the Canadian prison system there were frequent flashes that illuminated this perception.|$|R

5000|$|The main point-of-view {{character}} has renamed himself 'Orient', {{in the sense}} of 'align directions', on arrival in Bordertown. He is nicknamed [...] "Finder" [...] for his magical gift that lets him—or compels him to—locate things and people. His working partner is Tick-Tick, an elf woman whose gift for making and fixing technical things was as disturbing to her parents as Orient's talent was to his. A mysterious death opens the plot, making it <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> murder <b>mystery</b> as well as fantasy, and Orient's collaboration with volunteer cop Sunny Rico and her working partner Linn, also an elf, adds a police procedural element. Romance creeps in as Orient and Sunny cope with the plot's sequence of disasters.|$|R
25|$|Currently, the /w/ offglide is only {{believed}} to have existed in */aw/ and */uw/ resulting in the MSB o-class vowels /ɔ/ and /o/ respectively. The absence of */iw/ and */ow/ in reconstructions is <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery,</b> however it is possible that, by analogy with the /j/ offglide, */aw/ */iw/ */ow/ */uw/ all existed, resulting in pairs {{with or without the}} rounded on-glide: /ɔ/ /o/ /u̯ɔ/ /u̯o/ which later merged. This may explain why the Burmese orthography indicates the vowel /o/ with both the diacritics for both the /i/ and /u/ vowels and, previously, a following consonantal /w/.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, {{observations}} at X-ray wavelengths by the Chandra X-ray Observatory {{revealed the}} presence of extremely hot gas within NGC 6543 with the temperature of [...] It is thought that the very hot gas results from the violent interaction of a fast stellar wind with material previously ejected. This interaction has hollowed out the inner bubble of the nebula. Chandra observations have also revealed a [...] at {{the position of the}} central star. The spectrum of this source extends to the hard part of the X-ray spectrum, to 0.5–. A star with the photospheric temperature of about [...] would not be expected to emit strongly in hard X-rays, and so their presence is <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery.</b> It may suggest {{the presence of}} a high temperature accretion disk within a binary star system. The hard X-ray data remain intriguing more than ten years later: the Cat's Eye was included in a 2012 Chandra survey of 21 central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) in the solar neighborhood, which found: [...] "All but one of the X-ray point sources detected at CSPNe display X-ray spectra that are harder than expected from hot (~) central star photospheres, possibly indicating a high frequency of binary companions to CSPNe. Other potential explanations include self-shocking winds or PN mass fallback." ...|$|E

Thanks to this gigantic effort, our knowledge of vascular biology and engaged pathogenic mechanisms have grown enormously.

Before the night had passed orders were sent out to Bagration and Platov to take the offensive. [...] Alexander left Vilnius on June 26 and Barclay assumed overall command. Although Barclay wanted to give battle he assessed it as a hopeless situation and ordered Vilnius's magazines burned and its bridge dismantled. [...] Wittgenstein moved his command to Perkele passing beyond Macdonald and Oudinot's operations with Wittgenstein's rear guard clashing with Oudinout's forward elements. Doctorov on the Russian Left found his command threatened by Phalen's III cavalry corps.

2500|$|Half of the Yamna {{component}} {{is derived from}} a Caucasus hunter-gatherer strand (Satsurblia). On November 16, 2015, in {{a study published in}} the journal Nature Communications, geneticists announced that they had found a new fourth ancestral [...] "tribe" [...] or [...] "strand" [...] which had contributed to the modern European gene pool. They analysed genomes from two hunter-gatherers from Georgia which were 13,300 and 9,700 years old, and found that these Caucasus hunter-gatherers were probably the source of the farmer-like DNA in the Yamna. According to co-author Dr Andrea Manica of the University of Cambridge: [...] "The question of where the Yamnaya come from has been <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> up to now....we can now answer that as we've found that their genetic make-up is a mix of Eastern European hunter-gatherers and a population from this pocket of Caucasus hunter-gatherers who weathered much of the last Ice Age in apparent isolation." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1405 was the [...] "Year of the French" [...] in Wales. On the {{continent}} the French pressed the English as the French army invaded English Aquitaine. Simultaneously, the French landed in force at Milford Haven in west Wales. They had left Brest in July {{with more than}} 3,000 knights and men-at-arms led by Jean II de Rieux, Breton lord and Marshal of France. Unfortunately, {{they had not been}} provided with sufficient fresh water and many warhorses had died. They did though bring modern siege equipment. Joined by Owain's forces they marched inland and took the town of Haverfordwest but failed to take the castle. They then moved on and retook Carmarthen and laid siege to Tenby. What happened next is <b>something</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery.</b> The Franco-Welsh force marched right across South Wales (according to local tradition) and invaded England. According to one medieval chronicler, the unreliable Monstrelet, they marched through Herefordshire and on into Worcestershire where they met the English army west of Great Witley, just ten miles from Worcester, with Henry IV's army arrayed on Abberley Hill facing south towards Owain's army facing north on the defensive Iron Age hill fort of Woodbury Hill, still known locally as Owain's Hill. The armies took up battle positions daily and viewed each other from a mile without any major action for eight days. Neither initiated battle. Then, for reasons that have never been clear, both sides withdrew. Henry's strategy was to prolong the stand off and weaken and intimidate the Welsh army. The Welsh and French army cut off from resupply withdrew at nightfall back through Wales. If these events happened, it is strange that they left no trace in any contemporary English administrative or chronicle sources.|$|E
