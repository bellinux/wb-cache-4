50|$|As a {{two-stroke}} {{diesel engine}} {{is incapable of}} natural aspiration as defined above, some method of charging the cylinders with <b>scavenging</b> <b>air</b> must {{be integrated into the}} engine design. This is usually achieved with a positive displacement blower driven by the crankshaft. The blower does not act as a supercharger in this application, as it is sized to produce a volume of air flow that is in direct proportion to engine's requirement for combustion, at a given power and speed. By the Society of Automotive Engineer's definition, a mechanically scavenged two-stroke diesel engine is considered to be naturally aspirated.|$|E
50|$|Larger engines usually use a {{separate}} blower for scavenging {{and it was}} {{for this type of}} operation that the Roots blower has been utilized. Historically, many designs of blower have been used, from separate pumping cylinders, 'top hat' pistons combining two pistons of different diameter the larger one being used for scavenging, various rotary blowers and centrifugal turbo-compressors, including turbochargers. Turbocharging two-stroke engines is difficult, but not impossible, as a turbocharger does not provide any boost until it has had time to spin up to speed. Purely turbocharged two stroke engines may thus have difficulty when starting, with poor combustion and dirty exhausts, possibly even four-stroking. Some two-stroke turbochargers, notably those used on Electro-Motive Diesel locomotive engines, are mechanically driven at lower engine speeds through an overrunning clutch to provide adequate <b>scavenging</b> <b>air.</b> As engine speed and exhaust gas volume increase, the turbocharger no longer is dependent on mechanical drive and the overrunning clutch disengages.|$|E

50|$|Because {{the engine}} is 2-stroke, opposed-piston, the engine {{features}} no heads or valves. The two camshafts on the engine provide timing for two injection pumps per cylinder.

50|$|The Michel {{engine was}} a {{two-stroke}} diesel engine, of piston-ported opposed-piston design.

40|$|In {{order to}} make clear how the efflux angle changes in a small {{crankcase}} scavenged engine cylinder and in a large loop scavenged engine cylinder, the inlet flow pattern in the single cycle model cylinder has been observed by a high speed motion camera.

In a small crankcase scavenged engine cylinder, to keep the <b>scavenging</b> <b>air</b> stream {{in the direction of}} the scavenging port it is effective to incline the <b>scavenging</b> <b>air</b> passage between the crankcase and the cylinder, and to make thicker the cylinder wall where located scavenging port.

40|$|Maintenance {{is today}} an {{increasing}} {{part of the}} shipping industry. The demand for safer operations, lower emissions and low downtime is constantly increasing. As {{a result of this}} more complicated and complex system is developed and the focus on maintenance and efficient operations {{is becoming more and more}} important. As a result of this, models such as the TCI concept has been invented. The TCI concept is based on condition monitoring of the combustion process in the cylinder and the involved equipment. The objective is to detect slowly developing deviations in parameters related to efficiency, safety and environmental condition of the propulsion function. This is done through monthly measurements by the crew and sent to the TeCoMan database for processing. There the measurements are normalized for engine load and ambient conditions to be able to compare the results with reference values collected from the sea trial and equipment manufacturer. The measurements is then transformed to TCI’s which can be explored by the crew and administrators in the TeCoMan program. The TCI value reflect the severity of the performance and will decide what actions needs to be taken, and makes it possible for the crew and administrators to plan the maintenance The problem with the TCI model has been the "noisy" behaviour for the different parameters and the goal for this thesis has been to address this problem. Data from the TOCC project has been used throughout the project, one series of seven ship and one series of four ships. A in- depth study and a sensitivity analysis to study the influence of the correction factors has been done, where the mean effective pressure, cylinder pressure and the <b>scavenging</b> <b>air</b> pressure are the factors that were found to have the biggest influence. To identify the reason for the noisy behaviour each ship was studied to find the root cause. For the series with seven ships, erroneous measurements for both the parameters itself and the correction factors, are the main factor for the variations in the efficiency TCI’s. This errors results in large deviations for the corrected values and thus low TCI values. For the degradation it is the <b>scavenging</b> <b>air</b> filter pressure drop and fuel pump index which have the lowest TCI’s. For the <b>scavenging</b> <b>air</b> filter the low performance is due to the varying measurements done by the U-tube manometer. For the fuel pump index the corrected values are wrong due to a fuel flow of 0 m 3 /h. For the second series the large variations in both the measured parameters and the parameters used for correction, such as mean effective pressure and cylinder power, are the cause for the low TCI’s for both the efficiency and the degradation. With defined limits for the parameters based on expert opinions a large portion of the erroneous measurements would be eliminated. Also adjustment of reference and correction values for each ship due to individual differences could enhance the TCI performance. For the second series the routines for the different measurements needs to be improved. Good procedures and trained workers will help to keep the variations at a minimum. For unstable parameters lower weighted sum can be used to decrease the influence to aggregated systems. </p...|$|E

5000|$|The Humphrey pump {{could operate}} {{with either a}} {{four-stroke}} or two-stroke cycle. [...] Their normal operation was a four-stroke cycle. This required mechanical interlocks to the inlet valves, so that the exhaust and scavenge valves open once during the cycle to allow scavenging of the exhaust, but not during the compression cycle afterwards. A two-stroke cycle was also possible, if adequate scavenging could be achieved. The air trapped within the combustion chamber of a Humphrey pump has two roles: both for combustion and also as an air spring to maintain the oscillating water column. As this spring action involves a large volume of air, relative to the minimal air needed for combustion, the air cools easily to below the ignition temperature to pre-ignite the next charge. There {{would still be a}} risk of inefficient four-stroking though, unless the scavenging is effective enough to sweep out the previous exhaust gases. This was done by using a tall, thin combustion chamber so that the combustion air remained roughly isolated from the majority of the chamber's air and so was scavenged through the exhaust valves first. There was no separate <b>scavenge</b> <b>air</b> valve.|$|R

Air-blast direct fuel injection using a dedicated air pump has been successfully applied to both two- and four-stroke engines. In this study we re-examine {{the design of a}} low cost compression pressurized direct injection system. This system uses gases extracted from the combustion chamber during the compression stroke to supply pressure for the air blast injection, thus eliminating the air pump [1, 2]. Gases, predominantly <b>scavenging</b> <b>air,</b> are transferred to a mixing cavity from the combustion chamber via a small (5 mm diameter) solenoid poppet valve as the piston rises during the compression stroke. Proper functioning of the system requires careful optimization of the mixing cavity size and the blast valve timing to ensure adequate mixing cavity pressure and fuel atomization. To assist in the optimization of these design parameters a one-dimensional fluid dynamics model has been developed. Parameter sensitivity studies were carried out using the model to determine the optimum cavity size, blast valve timing, and fuel injection duration. These parameters were optimized over a wide range of engine speeds and throttle settings. Results show that a mixing cavity pressure of 500 kPa is attainable over the range of 1000 to 6000 rpm, from closed throttle to wide open throttle (WOT) without cavity pressurization encroaching into the ignition regime. Fuel maps and valve timings are presented and results are contrasted with the carbureted case, showing improved fuel efficiency and emissions for the direct injection system.

Moreover, model results using modelled droplet pH for January and July 2005 have been compared to model results applying a constant pH of 5 and to observations. The comparison to observations has shown that using a variable droplet pH improves the model performance concerning air concentrations and wet deposition fluxes of the investigated sulphur and nitrogen compounds. For SO x wet deposition fluxes the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) decreased by 16 % for July 2005 when using a variable droplet pH instead of a constant pH of 5. Concerning sulphate and SO 2 air concentrations the RMSE was reduced by 8 % and 16 % for July 2005, respectively.

40|$|As Arctic sea ice {{coverage}} declines it {{is expected}} that marine traffic could increase in this northern region due to shorter routes. Navigating in the Arctic offers opportunities and challenges for waste heat recovery systems (WHRS). Lower temperatures require larger heating power on board, hence a larger demand for waste heat usage, to cover services and maintaining on board spaces temperatures. However, a lower heat rejection temperature increases the WHRS thermal efficiency.

This model was incorporated into the dynamic framework of an entraining air parcel model with which we computed the uptake of nitrate by cloud drops whose size distribution changes with time because of condensation, collision-coalescence and break-up, Significant {{differences were found between}} the scavenging behavior of nitrate and our former esults on the scavenging behavior of sulfate. These reflect the following chemical and microphysical differences between the two systems: (1) nitrate particles occur in a larger size range than sulfate particles. (2) HNO 3 has a much greater solubility than SO 2 and is taken up irreversibly inside the drops in contrast to SO 2. (3) nitric acid in the cloud water is formed directly on uptake of HNO 3 gas whereas on uptake of SO 2 sulfuric acid is formed only after the reaction with oxidizing agents uch as e. g., H 202 or 03. (4) nitrate resulting from uptake of HNO 3 is confined mainly to small drops, whereas sulfate resulting from uptake of SO 2 is most concentrated in the largest, oldest drops, which have had the greatest time for reaction. Sensitivity studies showed that the nitrate concentration of small drops is significantly affected by the mass accommodation coefficient.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{a model of}} a ship {{propulsion}} system containing an engine, turbocharger, propeller and ship was constructed. The purpose of the model is to be used in controller design and testing. This is motivated by the fact that testing large marine diesel engines is limited due to large costs and difficulty providing a proper testbed facility. First compressor and turbine models were developed by fitting parameters to manufacturer turbocharger maps. A novel compressor model was made from using exponential functions. The performance of the compressor model surpassed that of a model commonly used in literature. However, to conclude this in the general case, more testing has to be performed. The development of an accurate turbocharger model was stimulated by possibilities of variable area turbine, wastegate and exhaust gas recirculation control. This would again lead to better transient air-to-fuel ratio control, turbocharger speed control and the reduction of pollutants. % extrapolationExtensions were made to an existing mean value engine model developed in an earlier project work by the same author, this included an intercooler and overload protection. The overload protection works through the use of fuel limiters based of torque and <b>scavenging</b> <b>air</b> pressure. In simulations these limiters showed to effectively maintain the air-to-fuel ratio for perfect combustion, however, at an increased engine response time. It was argued that the limiters could be superfluous if appropriate control of the air-to-fuel ratio was achieved. The engine and turbocharger were put to the test in simulations. Despite the lack of turbocharger experimental data in low speed regions, the simulations proved that the turbocharger model could cope with low engine load conditions at reduced turbocharger speed. In fact, results show that the engine and turbocharger models worked excellent in the entire speed region. Furthermore a propeller and ship model was developed. These models were tested in simulations together with a PI engine speed controller. Due to limited fuel actuation an integrator anti-windup scheme had {{to be included in the}} controller. The simulations showed that the PI controller was able to follow a slowly changing speed setpoint. However, due to the fact that the model is nonlinear and that no linearization, gain scheduling or excessive parameter tuning was performed, more advanced controller performance was not investigated. Moreover, further research on creating controllers for the purpose of suppressing propeller load torque fluctuations and subsequent engine overspeed is recommended. The total ship propulsion system showed to work in accordance to expected performance. All in all, this thesis provided as an enlightenment of the parameters and principles that are important in control of propulsion plants. Furthermore, it gives a testing environment for control design of various applications. </p...|$|E

Discrepancies between modeled and in situ measurements of gas-phase HNO 3 in the troposphere suggest that redistribution and removal mechanisms by cirrus ice have been poorly constrained. Limited in situ measurements have provided somewhat differing results and are not fully compatible with theory developed from laboratory studies. We present new airborne measurements of HNO 3 in cirrus clouds from anvil outflow made during the Tropical Composition, Cloud, and Climate Coupling Experiment (TC 4). Upper tropospheric (3 ̆e 9 km) measurements made during three flights while repeatedly traversing the same cloud region revealed depletions of gas-phase HNO 3 in regions characterized by higher ice water content and surface area. We hypothesize that adsorption of HNO 3 onto cirrus ice surfaces could explain this. Using measurements of cirrus ice surface area density and some assumptions about background mixing ratios of gas-phase HNO 3, we estimate molecular coverages of HNO 3 on cirrus ice surface in the tropical upper troposphere during the TC 4 racetracks to be about 1 × 1013 molecules cm- 2. This likely reflects an upper limit because potential dilution by recently convected, <b>scavenged</b> <b>air</b> is ignored. Also presented is an observation of considerably enhanced gas-phase HNO 3 at the base of a cirrus anvil suggesting vertical redistribution of HNO 3 by sedimenting cirrus particles and subsequent particle sublimation and HNO 3 evaporation.

Discrepancies between modeled and in situ measurements of gas‐phase HNO₃ in the troposphere suggest that redistribution and removal mechanisms by cirrus ice have been poorly constrained. Limited in situ measurements have provided somewhat differing results and are not fully compatible with theory developed from laboratory studies. We present new airborne measurements of HNO₃ in cirrus clouds from anvil outflow made during the Tropical Composition, Cloud, and Climate Coupling Experiment (TC 4). Upper tropospheric (> 9 km) measurements made during three flights while repeatedly traversing the same cloud region revealed depletions of gas‐phase HNO₃ in regions characterized by higher ice water content and surface area. We hypothesize that adsorption of HNO₃ onto cirrus ice surfaces could explain this. Using measurements of cirrus ice surface area density and some assumptions about background mixing ratios of gas‐phase HNO₃, we estimate molecular coverages of HNO₃ on cirrus ice surface in the tropical upper troposphere during the TC 4 racetracks to be about 1 × 10 ¹³ molecules cm− 2. This likely reflects an upper limit because potential dilution by recently convected, <b>scavenged</b> <b>air</b> is ignored. Also presented is an observation of considerably enhanced gas‐phase HNO₃ at the base of a cirrus anvil suggesting vertical redistribution of HNO₃ by sedimenting cirrus particles and subsequent particle sublimation and HNO₃ evaporation. The impact of released HNO₃, however, appears to be restricted to a very thin layer just below the cloud...|$|R
40|$|Hydroxy {{fatty acids}} (FAs) in fresh snow from Sapporo, {{one of the}} {{heaviest}} snowfall regions in the world, have been studied to ascertain the airborne bacterial endotoxin concentrations and their biomass. The presence of β-hydroxy FAs (C 9 –C 28), constituents of the Gram-negative bacterium (GNB), suggests long-range transport of soil microbes. Likewise, the occurrence of α- and ω-hydroxy FAs (C 9 –C 30 and C 9 –C 28, respectively) in snow reveals their contribution from epicuticular waxes and soil microorganisms. Estimated endotoxin and GNB mass can aid in assessing their possible impacts on the diversity and functioning of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, as well as lethal effects on pedestrians through dispersal of microbes. Air mass back trajectories together with hydroxy FAs reveal their sources from Siberia, the Russian Far East and northern China by the Asian monsoon. This study highlights the role of fresh snow that reduces the human health risk of GNB and endotoxin by the <b>scavenging</b> from <b>air...</b>|$|R
5|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of {{industrial}} whaling, great whales {{may have been the}} major food source for killer whales. The introduction of modern whaling techniques may have aided killer whales by the sound of exploding harpoons indicating availability of prey to <b>scavenge,</b> and compressed <b>air</b> inflation of whale carcasses causing them to float, thus exposing them to scavenging. However, the toll on great whale populations by unfettered whaling had possibly reduced their availability as prey for killer whales, and caused them to expand their consumption of smaller marine mammals, thus contributing to their decline as well.|$|R
40|$|A {{model was}} {{developed}} and {{used in conjunction with}} a control-volume-type engine simulation code for performance prediction of long stroke uniflow-type marine engines. In this model it is attempted to simulate the three different regions perceived to exist inside the cylinder during <b>scavenging,</b> namely the <b>air,</b> mixing, and combustion products regions, by modeling each region as a separate control volume. Two time-varying coefficients are used to specify the rates of entrainment of the air and the burned gases into the mixing region. Results of the use of the model for predicting the performance of a large marine two-stroke engine are presented...|$|R
