5000|$|Before being {{invaded by}} the Portuguese in the XVIth century, Casablanca {{used to be}} known as Anfa. The Portuguese used the ruins of Anfa to build a {{military}} fortress in 1515, and were eventually expelled by the Moroccan Saadi Dynasti in 1530. The foundation of the current port started during the reign of Sidi Mohammed Bin Abdellah, the Alawi Sultan of Morocco in the XVIIIth century. It is this Sultan who named it Addar Al Beida, or Casablanca. In the 19th century, the area's population began to grow as Casablanca became a major supplier of wool to the booming textile industry in Britain and shipping traffic increased. The British, in return, began importing gunpowder tea, a key ingredient in Morocco's national drink, mint tea.

40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} we analyze the {{integral}} logistics links in a Chilean and Spanish medium-sized port to determine the synergy and technological gaps in the export logistics chain, according to the links they hold with both the business core and processes at operational level. To assess the degree of synergy in a technological context, flow-charts of each service process in the Chilean port system are provided. A comparative analysis was accomplished for a Chilean and a Spanish medium- <b>sized</b> <b>port,</b> and then we determine the key factors related to Process and Communication Technologies PCT, technological integration and collaboration among the actors in the integral logistics; at strategic and business levels, some apparent causes that {{may account for the}} technology gaps in these two ports are also analyzed at operational level. New trends to implement a port platform for the export logistics chain based on a collaborative model to improve efficiency, effectiveness and efficacy in the port are proposed. Different technologies present in export logistics chains are used to improve the management of the cargo transportation by trucks and ensure traceability and tracking of cargo from the exporter to the port. Finally, discusses the main trends in technological development in ports at the country level...|$|E

The overall objective of this research has been met by providing supporting software tools with an accompanying database that has enabled <b>ports,</b> primarily small-to-medium <b>sized</b> <b>ports,</b> to enhance their efficiency. The research also developed and devised a modelling and evaluation technique or method that can take account of complete operational characteristics and perfonnance of a port and/or tenninal. This objective has been successfully achieved and the research has produced: Ã‚Â• An all-encompassing data model for the Maritime Transport Industry Ã‚Â• A Concern Net, the hierarchical system to be used for complete port'evaluation Ã‚Â• The generic software tools: 1. Port Process Simulator (PPS) 2. Tenninal Planning Board (TPB) 3. and accompanying database(DB), These Software tools have been tested and successfully validated by developing alternative scenarios for the modelled Tivoli Container Tenninal, Port of Cork - Republic of Ireland.

40|$|Shipments of {{container}} imports {{are heavily}} concentrated {{in a number}} of ports, which has resulted in pressures on logistics networks. Partly in response to such pressures, several new routes are being developed to gain access to US markets. One involves the port of Prince Rupert; the other is the expansion of the Panama Canal. The {{purpose of this article is}} to estimate prospective traffic flows through these logistics channels for container shipments to US markets. An optimization model is developed that accounts for congestion and demand uncertainty. It determines the optimal route, ship <b>size,</b> <b>port</b> and hinterland shipping channels based on cost minimization. Our results show that inter-port competition is very intense. Prince Rupert can become an important rival of US ports and routes and the expansion of the Panama Canal can have similar impacts. ...|$|R

The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by applying the optimization problem to a real case study referred to the port rail network of La Spezia Container Terminal located in Northern Italy. A computational analysis realized by varying the dimension and complexity of the problem instances is also reported in this paper to discuss the computational performance of the proposed model...|$|R

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{finite volume}} model, developed and validated in Part I of this two-part paper, is employed to study steady-state two-phase turbulent {{flow of liquid}} steel and argon bubbles through slide-gate tundish nozzles. Parametric studies are performed to investigate the effects of gas injection, slide-gate orientation, casting speed, gate opening, bubble <b>size,</b> <b>port</b> angle and port shape on the flow pattern and characteristics of the jet exiting the nozzle port. Argon gas injection bends the jet angle upward, enhances the turbulence level, and reduces {{the size of the}} back flow zone. Gas injection becomes less influential with increasing casting speed. The off-center blocking effect of the slide-gate generates asymmetric flow that changes with the gate orientation. The 0 ° gate orientation creates the worst biased flow between the two ports. The 90 ° orientation generates significant swirl and directs the jet slightly toward one of the wide faces. The 45 ° orientation generates both types of asymmetry, and thus appears undesirable. The horizontal jet angle indicates asymmetric flow in the horizontal plane. It increases wit...|$|R
