40|$|Research was {{conducted}} to remedy {{the lack of information}} on the effect of nitrogen fertilization on the seed and carvone (a potato <b>sprouting</b> <b>inhibitor)</b> production of dill under Dutch conditions. From two trials conducted in 1995 on fertile loamy soils it can be concluded that dill is able to efficiently take up the available nitrogen from dry soil. Due to a decrease of the harvest index, the highest biomass production, as a response to a high nitrogen rate, did not result in the highest seed yield. An increase of the nitrogen rate accelerated the ripening of the crop. The seed and carvone yields were largest in the 30 - 60 kg ha- 1 nitrogen treatments.

40|$|POTATOES sprout in 11 to 15 {{weeks after}} harvest if placed in storage where 'temperatures average 40 ° F or above. Prior to this, growth {{regulating}} substances within the tubers prevent sprouting. If potatoes are stored {{at room temperature}} (70 ° F or higher) their dormant period will be shorter, although differences in varieties are observed. [...] Varieties also differ in habit of [...] sprout growth*. Some develop long [...] sprouts that are relatively easy to [...] remove. Even so, {{a new crop of}} [...] sprouts will grow again from the [...] same eyes if storage temperatures [...] remain above 40 oF for ten days or [...] more. In addition to the expense of [...] desprouting, potatoes lose weight [...] and their market appeal. [...] Potatoes can be and are stored at 30 ° to 36 ° for nearly a year with very little sprouting. Cold storage at this temperature range has some disadvantages. For example, starches are converted to sugar within the tubers. These sugars give cooked potatoes a sweet taste objectionable to some people. Potatoes with a high sugar content are not suitable for chipping and french frying. Sometimes they can be reconditioned by storing at 60 ° to 70 ° for a month or more but this warmer environment starts sprouting. Potatoes sprouting extensively in bins (as illustrated in Figure 1) cannot be ventilated properly because sprouts fill the air spaces between tubers. Lack of air movement through the bin causes a low oxygen supply and black heart or b 1 ack patches soon appear within tubers (Figure 2). [...] Sprouting is costly to Alaskans in that it reduces the number of potatoes meeting U. S. No. 1 grade and therefore reduces farm income. Sprouting is costly to Alaskan's potato industry because it weakens Alaska's competitive position for summer markets. Summer im:orts of dormant potatoes often capture {{a large segment of the}} Alaskan potato market. [...] When these studies were begun, workers in other regions (2, 4, 5, 9) had demonstrated several methods of chemical sprout control. These methods included field spraying of tops, dusfng or dipping of tubers moving into storage, and gas treatment with volatile substances distributed within binned potatoes. Chemicals that had given the best control were methyl ester of naphthaleneacetic acid (MENA), indoleacetic acid (IA), maleic hydrazide (MH) and isopropyl N-(3 chlorophenyl) carbamate (CIPC). In other states MH has become so popular that it has been recently sprayed from an airplane (1) and CIPC has been released as an aerosol or vapor (6) within the storage. [...] Some evidence has been presented (3) showing that healing of tender skins and healing of tuber bruises is delayed by sprout inhibitors.

40|$|After harvest, sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas) storage root {{quality is}} reduced due to weight loss, {{sprouting}} and rots. There are also hidden quality losses relating to loss of nutritional compounds. In {{order to maintain}} sweetpotato quality during storage, sweetpotatoes need to be stored at 13 - 15 °C and 80 - 90 % RH. However, controlled temperature methods are difficult to achieve for subsistence farmers in less developed countries who have limited access to electric power. This work was undertaken to determine the potential postharvest techniques that would extend sweetpotato storage life without compromising phytochemical concentration. Postharvest treatments investigated in this work were hot water dipping (with or without coating) and ethylene (with or without 1 -MCP) treatments. The work was undertaken using mainly ‘Owairaka Red’ and ‘Clone 1820 ’ sweetpotato cultivars. Following treatments, these sweetpotatoes were stored at 25 °C and 80 - 90 % RH for 4 to 12 weeks. Hot water dipping (HWD) at 51 °C for 11 min delayed sprout growth by 2 weeks but increased weight loss. Coating (carnauba wax 5 %) significantly reduced weight loss, but increased sprout growth in ‘Owairaka Red’. A combination of HWD and coating was effective in reducing both sprout growth and weight loss. ß-carotene content measured in ‘Clone 1820 ’ ranged from 17. 3 to 25. 6 mg/ 100 g dry weight. The concentration was not affected by HWD or coating, but declined by about 30 % during 12 weeks storage. The calculated retinol activity equivalent (RAE) ranged from 363 to 537 RAE, per 100 g of edible portion of sweetpotato. Based on the recommended daily intake for vitamin A, a serve of 100 g would supply more than 25 % of daily retinol requirement for all age groups, suggesting that even after storage ‘Clone 1820 ’ is {{a good source of}} vitamin A. In addition, no treatment adversely affected the phenolic acid and anthocyanin concentrations. Roots that were HWD showed a subtle increase in total phenolic content, phenolic acids and anthocyanin concentration when compared to control roots, but the effect was shortlived. Previous studies have demonstrated that ethylene is a potential <b>sprout</b> <b>inhibitor,</b> but causes darkening of flesh colour and the development of off-flavours after cooking. Ethylene-induced responses may be inhibited by 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP). 1 - MCP and ethylene combined effects on sweetpotato physiological, flesh colour and phytochemical variables were assessed during storage. Ethylene treatment with or without 1 -MCP inhibited sprout growth, increased root respiration rates by 2 -fold, and caused root stem-end split leading to high weight loss and rots. Ethylene treatments also caused flesh darkening, and this was not prevented by a single 1 - MCP (1 µL L- 1) pre-storage treatment. When roots stored in continuous ethylene were subjected to multiple 1 -MCP (1 µL L- 1) treatments, the ethylene-induced root splitting and flesh darkening were delayed/reduced whilst maintaining minimal sprout growth. This implies that ethylene-induced negative responses in sweetpotato can be mitigated with on-going 1 -MCP treatment. The sensory results showed that roots stored in air were highly preferred by consumers over roots stored in ethylene; nevertheless, acceptance means scores of all treatments were above five, indicating that ethylene-induced flesh darkening was not severe enough to cause consumer rejection. Based on these findings, it is proposed that a combination of HWD and coatings can be used to extend non-refrigerated storage life of sweetpotato with no major effect on phytochemical content. The results on ethylene are consistent with previous findings that ethylene suppresses sprout elongation. However, the associated negative effects outweigh the benefits of using ethylene as a sprout control. Future research therefore should focus on finding ways to get the benefit of ethylene for sprout reduction without incurring risk of root splitting...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In the UK, up to {{six million}} tonnes of {{potatoes}} are produced annually {{and more than half}} of this production is stored for the fresh market and food processing. To maintain potato quality from sprouting, chlorpropham (CIPC) is currently used as the main sprout suppressant in commercial potato stores. Questions have been raised about the safety of application of this compound in potato stores due to increasing concern about the toxicity of its residue and degradation products mainly 3 -chloroaniline (3 -CA) on the potato tubers. To date, there is no realistic replacement of CIPC for inhibiting sprouting of potatoes destined for processing. Searching for alternatives is crucial particularly as most supermarkets demand foods free of chemicals. The <b>sprout</b> <b>inhibitor</b> 1, 4 -dimethylnaphthalene (1, 4 -DMN) can be a suitable replacement for CIPC as it is naturally occurring in the potato and currently used in many countries in the world. To introduce this compound to the UK for commercial use, many investigations must be conducted to ensure its safety for human health and the environment. This study intended to focus on the determination of the residue level of 1, 4 -DMN, CIPC and its metabolite 3 -CA in potato and water samples, hence developing analytical methods was required as a preliminary step. In this study, three HPLC systems were used for validating a separation method for the analysis of 1, 4 -dimethylnaphthalene and its internal standard 2 -methylnaphthalene (2 -MeN). Under the same chromatographic conditions, all these systems achieved excellent separation on a Jones-ODS column (Hypersil ODS 5 µm, 250 mm x 4. 6 mm) at ambient temperature isocratically using 70 % acetonitrile as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1. 5 mL/min, 20 µL injection volume, a run time of 10 minutes and a detection wavelength of 228 nm. All three systems showed high precision (RSD% < 1 %), good linearity of the calibration curves at two concentration ranges (0. 02 – 0. 1 and 0. 2 – 1. 0 µg/mL) of each 1, 4 -DMN and 2 -MeN with coefficient of determination (R 2) of the regression line of 0. 990 or more. The best system SpectraSERIES UV 100 -autosampler system was selected for the remainder of this research as it offered lower values for both the limit of detection (LOD) (0. 001 – 0. 004 µg/mL) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) (0. 002 – 0. 013 µg/mL) for both compounds. A second isocratic reversed phase HPLC-UV method was developed and validated for analysis of 1, 4 -DMN and 2 -MeN using methanol as a substitute solvent for standards and mobile phase preparations to overcome the problem of a global shortage of acetonitrile during 2008 – 2009. The best separation was achieved on the Phenomenex® (ODS- 2 250 mm x 4. 60 mm 5 µm Sphereclone) column using 90 % methanol as mobile phase at a flow rate of 1. 5 mL/min and a 6 minute run time. The method was validated producing good precision, linearity and low values of LOQ (~ 0. 001 µg/mL). A straightforward and rapid isocratic HPLC-UV method was developed and validated for the simultaneous analysis of both CIPC and its degradation product 3 -CA using methanol as a solvent and propham (IPC) as an internal standard. To achieve high resolution of the three compounds, the chromatographic conditions selected were: Phenomenex® column (ODS- 2 250 mm x 4. 60 mm 5 µm Sphereclone), 62 % methanol at a flow rate of 1. 5 mL/min, detection wavelength of 210 nm and a 15 minute run time. Method validation confirmed good precision, acceptable linearity and low values of LOD (~ 0. 01 µg/mL) and LOQ (~ 0. 04 µg/mL) for CIPC and 3 -CA. These proposed HPLC methods are suitable to apply for the determination of the studied compounds in both potatoes and water samples. Quantitative laboratory analysis of 1, 4 -DMN, 2 -MeN, CIPC and 3 -CA in water solutions showed acceptable standard preparations in water with good precision and linearity and lower values of LOD and LOQ close to those obtained in organic solvent preparations. An adsorption study of 1, 4 -DMN and 2 -MeN on laboratory ware showed that glass materials were acceptable to use whereas there was a considerable adsorption to plastic containers and filters. In contrast, 3 -CA showed no adsorption onto any of the laboratory ware tested. CIPC also showed good recoveries with most of the materials tested. In reviewing the literature, no suitable published method for the simultaneous determination of CIPC and its metabolite 3 -CA in potato peel was found. A simple analytical method was developed based on methanol-soaking overnight extraction coupled with HPLC-UV for analysis of CIPC and 3 -CA in potato samples using IPC as internal standard. The method was validated and the calculated limit of quantification was 0. 01, 0. 05 and 0. 02 µg/g in whole tuber for CIPC, IPC and 3 -CA respectively. The efficiency of the method reported recovery values of up to 90 % for both CIPC and IPC through spiking organic potato peel at three spiking levels of 0. 8, 8. 0 and 80 µg/g. By contrast, 3 -CA recoveries offered very low values of 10 and 23 % at concentration levels of 8. 0 and 80 µg/g respectively and no peak was detected at the lower level of 0. 8 µg/g. This method was compared with the routine Soxhlet-GC method used for the analysis of the residues of CIPC in potato samples at the University of Glasgow laboratory and gave results approximately 23 % higher residues of CIPC. This new method at this stage was suitable to extract CIPC in 20 potato samples daily. Nevertheless, an interesting finding was that despite the low recovery of 3 -CA it was identified in treated potato samples. This unanticipated low recovery is noteworthy and indicates that the actual residue may be much higher. A comprehensive study was made to improve the extractability of 3 -CA from potato samples investigating parameters including potato variety, extracting solvent, extraction method, spiking procedure and different treatments for potato samples. All these experimental trials showed no recovery improvements, thus four possible mechanisms were suggested for poor recovery of 3 -CA including volatilisation, reaction with potato components, enzymatic activity and ion exchange related to pH. Under the laboratory work experimental conditions, no measurable loss of 3 -CA by volatilisation was found. No reaction of 3 -CA was found to occur with other potato components under the experimental conditions used. However, the Schiff base reaction and/or hydrogen bonding may link the amino group of 3 -CA and some functional groups abundant in potatoes (e. g. carbonyl, quinone). This study also showed a potential role for enzymatic activity in the poor recovery of 3 -CA. Using antioxidants or acidity to inhibit this enzymatic activity was shown to enhance the extractability of 3 -CA. Binding of 3 -CA to potato peel substrates by ion exchange is unlikely as the pKa value of 3 -CA is lower than the pH of the potato. However, using sulphuric acid combined with methanol as an extracting solution improved the recovery. Optimising the extraction process showed that using a mixture of 1 M H 2 SO 4 in 50 % methanol as an extracting solution for 24 hours at 50 ºC improved the extraction recovery of 3 -CA up to 85 %. This final extraction method was applied for the determination of the residues of both CIPC and 3 -CA in commercial potato samples which had received many applications of CIPC, thus reporting high residue values. Additionally, potato samples were taken from different UK stores for the storage season 2010 – 2011 which had received CIPC application at high and low temperature (450 ºC and 270 ºC respectively) fogging. Analysis of these potato samples showed no significant difference between high and low temperature for the first application of CIPC for both residues of 3 -CA and CIPC. A significant increase in both compounds was found between the first and second application at 270 ºC indicating a possible build up with time during storage.

Chemicals are cheaper, but their application is not always reliable, especially at temperatures higher than 15 'C. Moreover in some countries the application of chemical inhibitors is prohibited.

40|$|Organic growers need {{information}} on variety performance under their growing conditions. A 4 -year onion variety research project was carried out to investigate whether setting up a variety testing system combining conventional and organic variety trials is feasible and efficient rather than organizing separate variety trials under the two management systems. During 4 years commercial onion cultivars were tested at a certified organic and a non-organic location. Both systems were managed without chemical pest, disease and sprouting control, but differed in fertility management (organic manure in autumn versus synthetic fertilizer), soil cultivation and weed management (mechanical weeding versus application of herbicide). Management system significantly affected plant density, thickness of neck, and proportion of small and large bulbs. Variety × management system interactions were significant for bulb uniformity, earliness, proportion of large bulbs, dormancy and relative storage success but did not change the ranking of the varieties. We conclude that organic growers can profit from a more conscious variety choice when conventionally fertilised trials would refrain from using pesticides, fungicides, herbicides and <b>sprout</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> However, this would require an adaptation of the management protocol {{in such a way}} that trials might no longer represent conditions of conventional farmers. Furthermore, assessments of leaf erectness, disease resistance to downy mildew and leaf blight should be included in the protocols for organic use.

40|$|The term of {{dormancy}} {{is often}} used to describe the storability of potato tubers. A dormancy value or duration defines the period potato tubers can be stored before initiating sprouting. Characterization of dormancy value provides useful information to implement strategies for short or long-term storage of potato varieties and can be instrumental to schedule treatment of potato tubers with <b>sprouting</b> <b>inhibitors.</b> The dormancy values of the varieties are provided by breeders and research institutes. Those values can be retrieved from online databases. Comparison of the aforementioned online databases shows that the information is not available for all varieties and that this information can be variable and/or very different for some varieties. The variability {{can be explained by the}} heterogeneity of the methods used to determine the dormancy values (e. g. the use of different control varieties and the use of different dormancy scales). The aim of this study is to compare different statistical models based on linear regression analysis that could be used to calculate the dormancy value of a potato variety using field trials data and the corresponding post-harvest observations of tuber sprouting. To perform this comparison, we used dormancy value data collected for 210 potato varieties over 25 years in six locations in Switzerland (Swiss variety testing network datasets). This work provides a comparison of the performances of the different models that are tested and suggests novel methodologies to assess and calculate the dormancy values of the potato varieties...|$|R
40|$|Exogenous {{ethylene}} {{is commonly}} used as a commercial <b>sprouting</b> <b>inhibitor</b> of potato tubers. The role of ethylene in the control of sprouting of sweetpotato roots, however, is not known. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the role of ethylene in control of sprouting in sweetpotato roots by observing the effect of an ethylene synthesis inhibitor, aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), and the ethylene antagonist, 1 -methylcyclopropene (1 -MCP), in the presence and absence of exogenous ethylene on root sprouting and associated sugar accumulation. Continuous exposure to 10 μl L− 1 ethylene, 24 h exposure to 625 nl L− 1 1 -MCP or dipping in 100 μl L− 1 AVG all inhibited sprout growth in sweetpotato roots of two varieties over 4 weeks of storage at 25 °C. The observations that both ethylene on its own and 1 -MCP, which inhibits ethylene action, inhibit sprout growth indicate that while continuous exposure to exogenous ethylene leads to sprout growth inhibition, ethylene is also required for sprouting. In potato tubers ethylene is required to break dormancy, while continuous exposure inhibits sprout growth. Monosaccharide concentrations in ethylene, 1 -MCP or AVG treated roots were lower than in untreated roots, and for ethylene treated roots this was associated with higher respiration rates. This is consistent with the activation of some additional process by ethylene which uses energy through sugar metabolism. 1 -MCP and AVG both inhibited this increase in respiration rate and counteracted the decrease in monosaccharide concentrations. 1 -MCP presumably counteracts the ethylene stimulation of this process, while the effect of AVG is attributed to its possible inhibitory effects on protein synthesis...|$|R

Those values can be retrieved from online databases. The objective {{of this study is}} to compare the dormancy values gathered from online databases with the dormancy values collected in Switzerland through field and storage experiments. This comparison is performed using linear regression analysis. So, 2 sources of information were used: 1) dormancy of cultivars provided by breeders (breeders dormancy) 2) dormancy of cultivars obtained from field experiments (field dormancy). The field experiments were managed in Switzerland during 25 years in four different locations and for 721 varieties of potatoes. Field data were registered during the growing season such as weather data (e. g. temperature, rainfall etc.), soil data and crop management data. One month after harvest, the potatoes were stored at 8 °C in wooden crates containing 7 kg of potato tubers. The dormancy was defined as the time between the harvest and the emergence of the first sprouts. The results are the following: the dormancy of cultivars provides by online databases are incomplete and heterogeneous. This can be explained by the heterogeneity of the methods used by breeders to determine the dormancy values (e. g. the use of different control varieties and the use of different dormancy scales). The comparison of breeders and field dormancy through linear regression leads to the proposal of novel methodologies to assess and calculate the dormancy values of the potato varieties. Our results also stress the importance of climatic and field parameters to estimate the dormancy length of a given potato stock...|$|R
40|$|Sterman Masser, Inc. is {{committed}} to minimizing food loss throughout the process of growing, harvesting, and packaging a consumer ready product {{through the use of}} cutting edge technology industry leading techniques. Combining Integrated Pest Management with crop rotations and more resistant potato varieties, SMI has minimized the potential for crop destroying fungi and insects to propagate. In response to hazards from rocks in the soil and the stresses from harvesting we have acquired rock crushers capable of pulverizing everything down to a powder and new harvesters designed to reduce the stresses of harvesting. Potatoes, coming from the fields, enter our state-of-the-art cold storage facility that combines ideal climate conditions with treatment by gassing and <b>sprout</b> <b>inhibitors</b> to combat food loss due to decay and significantly extend the useable life of the potatoes. Potatoes entering SMI’s packing facility are processed with low impact techniques and equipment, on a First In, First Out policy designed to get product from the field to the consumer in the shortest possible time. In the past, product not suited for table stock quality was simply removed and discarded. Today, thanks to the construction of the Keystone Potato Products facility, we can salvage what was previously considered waste product. In the event of a natural disaster, KPP has the capacity to process every single potato, no matter what defect, to provide nourishment to those in need. Potatoes with small to moderate defects can be processed into fresh cut consumer products through automated equipment capable of identifying and removing those parts unfit for human consumption. Potatoes unfit for the fresh cut process, as well as the waste generated by that process, can be further refined into dehydrated products ensuring every single potato can be made useable for human consumption. Even the peel waste can be salvaged for use as feed for livestock...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide {{production}} of potatoes is {{in excess of}} 350 million metric tonnes per annum, of which 60 % is intended for human consumption. Since the period of tuber dormancy before tuber buds sprout is usually shorter than the optimal market storage period, control of sprouting is essential. To prolong dormancy, tubers are either stored at low temperatures and/or are treated with chemical <b>sprout</b> <b>inhibitors,</b> the use of which subject to increasing scrutiny in the European Union due to their impact upon the environment. Cytokinins, a group of plant growth regulators, are known to {{play a central role}} in tuber bud sprouting and tuber initiation from stolon tips in Solanum tuberosum L. although it is unclear when and how cytokinins act to regulate dormancy. The interconversion of cytokinins is incompletely understood. Enzymes identified to date have higher affinities for aminopurines than their cytokinin equivalents. A novel cytokinin binding protein Solanum tuberosum Cytokinin Phosphorylase 1 (StCKP 1), has been identified in tuberising stolon tips which shares regions of homology with members of the nucleosidase and phosphoribosyl transferase family. The composition of cytokinin N 9 conjugates in tuber bud and surrounding tissue is known to change on transition from a dormant state, with an increase in base and riboside types observed. Analysis of transcripts indicates an increase in abundance of StCKP 1 on tuberisation of stolon tips, and high abundance in the periderm of dormant tubers. Analysis of protein abundance by immunoblotting echoes this finding and indicates StCKP 1 begins to accumulate in stolon tips shortly before tuberisation, matching binding activity. Transgenic analysis of the cytological reporter gene uidA under the control of two identified promoter regions indicates StCKP 1 is expressed predominantly in tuber tissue. Analysis of StCKP 1 activity by HPLC and LC-MS-MS shows that StCKP 1 catalyses the interconversion of free base and riboside. KMs determined for cytokinin and aminopurine substrates indicate that StCKP 1 has a higher affinity for cytokinin substrates and, of these cytokinins, displays a higher affinity for the free base catalysing ribosylation of the N 9 to form the corresponding riboside. Desiree cultivars over-expressing StCKP 1 under the CaMV 35 S promoter exhibited an increased rate of tuberisation of stolon tips and an increase in the length of the dormant period following lifting. Over-expression of StCKP 1 was found in particular to increase the chill sensitive period of dormancy, confirming results of StCKP 1 knock-down by RNAi. Transcript abundance of StCKP 1 at tuberisation in other cultivars including King Edward and Maris Peer was found to correlate with the dormancy characteristics prescribed by the European Cultivated Potato Database and the British potato variety database.

40|$|Potatoes are {{increasingly}} {{consumed in the}} form of processed foodstuffs such as French fries and crisps. After harvest, potatoes need to be kept at low temperature to prevent sprouting during storage for round-the-year processing. However, tubers accumulate reducing sugars at low temperatures, a phenomenon referred to as cold-induced sweetening (CIS). The processing of these high sugar potatoes into crisps or fries leads to a dark brown to black product that renders them unfit for human consumption and causes a great loss to the processing industry. To prevent sprouting and diseases, chemical treatments have been applied to tubers in storage. The recent withdrawal of these chemicals has increased the reliance on cold storage for potato tubers and highlighted the importance of CIS. Extensive research is required to produce a cultivar resistant to cold induced sweetening (CIS) along with good processing quality. The present work focused on increasing the understanding of the biological processes (physiological, biochemical and molecular) contributing to the initiation and/or controlling of CIS in potato tubers. The genetic basis of this trait was examined in progeny from a cross between potato cultivars with poor and excellent CIS response. This included molecular markers for candidate genes of known position on potato chromosomes to assess the role of different alleles involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Association studies between marker alleles and the phenotype of the progeny were performed. Among all the candidate genes, allele diversity for apoplastic invertase inhibitor gene was further studied from resistant and susceptible potato cultivars. In total five alleles were identified. Polymorphism was observed in both exon and intron regions. Three alleles had a unique substitution at the predicted junction of the signal peptide and mature protein. In order to identify the specific alleles that {{may play a role in}} resistance to CIS, transgenic potato plants have been produced with overexpression and antisense repression of apoplastic invertase inhibitor alleles. The results revealed that there were no consistent differences in CIS traits among the transgenic lines with the various alleles. However, the results of the transcript analysis showed much higher and stable transcripts levels of the apoplastic invertase inhibitor in the 1021 / 1 derived transgenic lines. This greater accumulation or stability of the apoplastic invertase inhibitor transcripts in 1021 / 1 may be a key factor contributing to the CIS trait of this cultivar. A key difference from previous studies involves the use of 1021 / 1, a potato cultivar known to have the very high resistance to CIS. This study provided to help identify key genes for the future genetic improvement of tuber properties with respect to long-term storage and processing characteristics. The development of a potato that does not sweeten in the cold will revolutionize the potato industry as this problem currently contributes 20 percent losses after crop harvest. Once identified, clones resistance to CIS could be used in potato breeding programmes for the development of cold-resistant processing cultivars. Eliminating the need for chemical application of <b>sprout</b> <b>inhibitors</b> will be helpful to develop sustainable approaches to benefit both mankind and potato industries. These biotechnological tools will be used to identify elite potatoes with improved properties of the tuber with respect to long-term storage and processing characteristics (cold-sweetening and after-cooking darkening) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{level of}} jasmonic acid (JA) in {{medullary}} tissues of intact potato tubers {{was found to}} be very low [ca. 4 ng (g fr wt) " 1]. When the tissues were excised and incubated on moistened filter paper, the level of JA began to increase rapidly, reached a maximum 4 h after excision and de-creased thereafter. The maximum level of JA observed after 4 h was 450 ng (g fr wt) ~'. The level of JA-related compounds, as estimated by a bioassay for potato tuber-inducing activity, showed similar fluctuations to those in the level of JA, and neither methyl jasmonate nor tuberonic acid could be detected in the tissues at any time. These results suggest that the increase in the level of JA is due to the synthesis of JA and the decrease is due to the degradation of JA. The accumula-tion of JA was found only in tissues of dormant tubers that had been stored for less than 5 months and not in those of <b>sprouting</b> tubers. Two <b>inhibitors</b> of animal phospholipase A 2, name-ly, manoalide and quinacrine, did not inhibit the accumulation of JA, a result that suggests that activation of phospholipase A 2 is not involved in the synthesis of JA. Actinomycin D and chloramphenicol also had no effect on the accumulation of JA but cycloheximide had a con-siderable inhibitory effect. The results suggest that a newly synthesized protein(s) is the rate-limiting factor in the biosynthesis of JA...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} solid tumours beyond a {{critical}} size {{is dependent upon}} angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from an existing vasculature. Tumours may remain dormant at microscopic sizes for some years before switching to a mode in which growth of a supportive vasculature is initiated. The new blood vessels supply nutrients, oxygen, and access to routes by which tumour cells may travel to other sites within the host (metastasize). In recent decades an abundance of biological {{research has focused on}} tumour-induced angiogenesis in the hope that treatments targeted at the vasculature may result in a stabilisation or regression of the disease: a tantalizing prospect. The complex and fascinating process of angiogenesis has also attracted the interest of researchers in the field of mathematical biology, a discipline that is, for mathematics, relatively new. The challenge in mathematical biology is to produce a model that captures the essential elements and critical dependencies of a biological system. Such a model may ultimately be used as a predictive tool. In this thesis we examine a number of aspects of tumour-induced angiogenesis, focusing on growth of the neovasculature external to the tumour. Firstly we present a one-dimensional continuum model of tumour-induced angiogenesis in which elements of the immune system or other tumour-cytotoxins are delivered via the newly formed vessels. This model, based on observations from experiments by Judah Folkman et al., is able to show regression of the tumour for some parameter regimes. The modelling highlights a number of interesting aspects of the process that may be characterised further in the laboratory. The next model we present examines the initiation positions of blood vessel sprouts on an existing vessel, in a two-dimensional domain. This model hypothesises that a simple feedback inhibition mechanism may be used to describe the spacing of these <b>sprouts</b> with the <b>inhibitor</b> being produced by breakdown of the existing vessel's basement membrane. Finally, we have developed a stochastic model of blood vessel growth and anastomosis in three dimensions. The model has been implemented in C++, includes an openGL interface, and uses a novel algorithm for calculating proximity of the line segments representing a growing vessel. This choice of programming language and graphics interface allows for near-simultaneous calculation and visualisation of blood vessel networks using a contemporary personal computer. In addition the visualised results may be transformed interactively, and drop-down menus facilitate changes in the parameter values. Visualisation of results is of vital importance in the communication of mathematical information to a wide audience, and we aim to incorporate this philosophy in the thesis. As biological research further uncovers the intriguing processes involved in tumourinduced angiogenesis, we conclude with a comment from mathematical biologist Jim Murray, Mathematical biology is : : : the most exciting modern application of mathematics...|$|R
