40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{gain insight into}} ways to enhance teacher retention. Principals and {{beginning}} teachers from 11 Dutch urban primary schools were interviewed about their schools' support structure and culture. <b>Schools</b> <b>where</b> teachers judged about the support they received positively and <b>schools</b> <b>where</b> teachers evaluated this support negatively were contrasted. The study revealed that all schools undertook support activities, such as offering beginning teachers a buddy or coach. However, at <b>schools</b> <b>where</b> teachers judged the support positively, these activities were performed more consistently and conscientiously than at the other schools. Furthermore, cultural rather than structural characteristics distinguished the schools. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
