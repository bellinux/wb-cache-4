500|$|On August 31, Tancredo shifted {{momentarily}} {{to a new}} issue. On {{the two-year}} anniversary of the landfall of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, he called for funds to be withdrawn and federal aid be cut off for the recovery effort. He remarked that it was time, [...] "the taxpayer gravy train left the New Orleans station." [...] The move was perhaps a step for the candidate to woo fiscal conservatives and advocates for states' rights, commenting that [...] "at some point, {{state and local officials}} and individuals have got to <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> and take some initiative, the mentality that people can wait around indefinitely for the federal taxpayer to solve all their worldly problems has got to come to an end." ...|$|E
500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole {{was pleased}} that the writers decided to let her {{character}} discover Walter's secret, commenting [...] "Astrid finds out in a really emotional way because Walter lets it slip to her accidentally. I {{think that it was}} really nice for them to invite Astrid into the importance of that instead of keeping her in the dark. At least she knows that she's a part of this family and this affects her. I think she serves as a really important character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of the only person that isn't directly involved with everything that is still on his side. She has to <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> and be that comfort for him because if he doesn't have anyone there, he's basically going to regress {{and go back to the}} place, I think mentally, that he was in when he was in the mental institution. And of course we don't want that." ...|$|E

"In an unhurried manner {{not unlike}} a leisurely {{afternoon}} game, author Steve Rushin wanders through the fields of baseball, passing through locker rooms and outfields, touching upon every object in between.

2500|$|Game four of {{the series}} proved {{to be just as}} exhilarating as the {{previous}} three games.

[...] With the game tied in the tenth Pete Rose started a rally with a one-out single. [...] Schmidt flied out for the second out and Luzinski <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> pinch-hitting for McBride.

2500|$|In 2011, The Lancet {{published}} {{a study by}} the UK-based [...] "PACE trial management group", which reported success with graded exercise therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy for chronic fatigue syndrome; a follow-up study was published in Lancet Psychiatry in 2015. [...] The studies attracted criticism from some patients and researchers, especially with regard to data analysis that was different from that described in the original protocol. In a 2015 Slate article biostatistician Bruce Levin of Columbia University was quoted saying “The Lancet needs to stop circling the wagons and be open”, and that “one of the tenets of good science is transparency”; while Ronald Davis of Stanford University said that “the Lancet should <b>step</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>plate</b> and pull that paper". [...] Horton defended the Lancet's publication of the trial and called the critics [...] "a fairly small, but highly organized, very vocal and very damaging group of individuals who have, I would say, actually hijacked this agenda and distorted the debate so that it actually harms the overwhelming majority of patients." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{pre-season}} {{prior to}} the 1949 NFL season, the Lions played an exhibition game against the Philadelphia Eagles in New Orleans. [...] Coach McMillin met with the Lions' three African-American players (Mann, Groomes and Wally Triplett) before the trip. [...] He explained that {{there had never been}} an interracial game in New Orleans. [...] McMillan said he did not think he should break the prohibition and that the three of them would also not be permitted to stay with the team at the hotel. [...] McMillan offered to let the three attend the game and sit on the bench, but Mann declined. [...] Interviewed in 2005, he recalled the incident:"I said if I can't play in the game I don't want to sit on the bench. ... Bo could've ended all that. He was supposed to be Mr. Great Liberal. But he didn't do it. He just passed it by. He could've been a big guy, a big fellow, but he didn't do it. I've never forgotten that. Don't tell me how liberal Bo was; he wasn't.
