Permeability of NAG in various enhancer suspensions was evaluated by using shed snakeskin as a model membrane via Franz-type cell diffusion studies.

25|$|Potassium iodide can be {{conveniently}} {{prepared as}} a <b>saturated</b> <b>solution,</b> abbreviated SSKI. This method of delivering potassium iodide {{does not require}} a method to weigh out the potassium iodide so it can be used in an emergency situation. KI crystals are simply added to water until no more KI will dissolve and instead sits {{at the bottom of the}} container. With pure water, the concentration of KI in the solution depends only on the temperature. Potassium iodide is highly soluble in water so SSKI is a concentrated source of KI. At 20 degrees Celsius the solubility of KI is 140-148grams per 100grams of water. Because the volumes of KI and water are approximately additive, the resulting SSKI solution will contain about 1.40gram (1400mg) KI per milliliter (mL) of solution. This is 100% weight/volume (note units of mass concentration) of KI (one gram KI per mL solution), which is possible because SSKI is significantly more dense than pure water—about 1.72 g/mL. Because KI is about 76.4% iodide by weight, SSKI contains about 764mg iodide per mL. This concentration of iodide allows the calculation of the iodide dose per drop, if one knows the number of drops per milliliter. For SSKI, a solution more viscous than water, there are assumed to be 15 drops per mL; the iodide dose is therefore approximately 51mg per drop. It is conventionally rounded to 50mg per drop.|$|E
