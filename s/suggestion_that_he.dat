5|$|After Leif's {{first trip}} to Vinland, he {{returned}} to the family estate of Brattahlíð in Greenland, and started preaching Christianity to the Greenlanders. His father Erik reacted coldly to the <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should abandon his religion, while his mother Thjóðhildr quickly became a Christian and built a church called Thjóðhild's Church. Leif is last mentioned alive in 1019, and by 1025 he had passed on his chieftaincy of Eiríksfjǫrðr to another son, Thorkell. Nothing is mentioned about his death in the sagas—he probably died in Greenland some time between these dates. Nothing further is known about his family beyond the succession of Thorkell as chieftain.|$|E
5|$|As he {{was unable}} to travel during 1916, Kropotkin found himself in {{frequent}} correspondence with others, including Jean Grave, who visited Kropotkin from France with his wife. Together, they discussed the war and Kropotkin's firm support for it. At Kropotkin's <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would like to have been a combatant were he younger, Grave suggested publishing a document urging anarchists to support the war effort {{on the side of the}} Allied Powers. Initially hesitant, due to his personal inability to sign up for active duty, Kropotkin was eventually persuaded by Grave.|$|E

5|$|Considerably {{shorter than}} the average footballer at 5ft 7in, Gibbs made up for his {{physical}} disadvantage with positional play, determination, accurate tackling, and staying on his feet. Although a defender, his lack of goals (7 in 491 appearances) and reluctance to get forward were often remarked upon. Gibbs refuted the <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> didn't attack enough, while former managers Roeder and Taylor both considered Gibbs to be an excellent crosser of the ball when he did venture forward. He scored his first professional goal during his 59th game. By comparison, Gibbs' long-term successor at right-back, Lloyd Doyley, scored his first professional goal on his 269th appearance.|$|E
5|$|Sue's cheer squad loses at Regionals for {{the first}} time in seven years, and she is named Loser of the Year in a {{televised}} interview with Katie Couric. Furthering her ire, the cheerleading budget is slashed due to the cannon being seen as endangering the lives of children. The money is then handed over to the glee club so they can pay to go to regionals. Karofsky dismisses Finn's <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> join the glee club permanently. Finally, Quinn kisses Finn, telling him that his actions have reminded her of why she loved him.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh {{returned}} to Cuesmes in August 1880, where he lodged with a miner until October. He {{became interested in}} the people and scenes around him, and recorded them in drawings after Theo's <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> take up art in earnest. He travelled to Brussels later in the year, to follow Theo's recommendation that he study with the Dutch artist Willem Roelofs, who persuaded him – in spite of his dislike of formal schools of art – to attend the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts. He registered at the Académie in November 1880, where he studied anatomy and the standard rules of modelling and perspective.|$|E
50|$|The <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a Professor of Mathematics from Oxford University and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had tutored the Tsarevich Pavel {{prior to}} moving to Moscow {{have not been}} substantiated.|$|R

5000|$|There {{have been}} <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{might have been}} murdered because, for example, a witness claimed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been with another man at Corrour railway station, but {{forensic}} evidence points to suicide ...|$|R
5|$|After his tournament {{victory in}} July 2007, Asashōryū decided {{to skip the}} {{regional}} summer tour of Tōhoku and Hokkaidō beginning on 3 August because of injury. The medical forms submitted to the Japan Sumo Association indicated that injuries to his left elbow and a stress fracture in his lower back would require six weeks of rest to heal. However, he was then seen on television participating in a soccer match for charity with Hidetoshi Nakata in his homeland of Mongolia. He {{was reported to have}} done so {{at the request of the}} Japanese Foreign Ministry and the Mongolian government. However, the <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had exaggerated the extent of his injuries to avoid his duties on the exhibition tour caused a media storm.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{his years}} in the Philippines, Taft was keenly {{interested}} as president in East Asian affairs. Taft considered relations with Europe relatively unimportant, {{but because of the}} potential for trade and investment, Taft ranked the post of minister to China as most important in the Foreign Service. Knox did not agree, and declined a <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> go to Peking to view the facts on the ground. Taft considered Roosevelt's minister there, William W. Rockhill, as uninterested in the China trade, and replaced him with William J. Calhoun, whom McKinley and Roosevelt had sent on several foreign missions. Knox did not listen to Calhoun on policy, and there were often conflicts. Taft and Knox tried unsuccessfully to extend John Hay's Open Door Policy to Manchuria.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Marge wake on New Year's Day with hangovers {{after the}} family's New Year's Eve celebration. As Homer {{takes out the}} garbage, Chief Wiggum, Eddie, and Lou arrive and issue him {{multiple}} citations and fines - the result of recently passed, frivolous laws intended to bring in revenue for the city when broken. Taking Moe's <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> bribe a city official to clear up the fines, Homer leaves a sack full of cash on the official's desk but is promptly arrested, convicted, and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Wiggum takes pity on Homer and tells him to meet with an FBI agent, who offers to reduce the sentence if Homer will go undercover in the prison to investigate Fat Tony, who is also serving time along with his top henchmen.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} Jackson's fans {{reportedly}} criticized Moss and his performances as {{making fun of}} the singer. Moss denies <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> exploits and portrays Jackson in a negative manner.|$|R
50|$|After leaving Congress, Bethune served from 1986-1988 as the Arkansas Republican Party state Chairman. <b>He</b> {{resisted}} <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> run {{for governor}} in 1986, and the nomination went to Frank White.|$|R
50|$|Barnaud {{traveled}} widely {{around the}} turn of the seventeenth century. This has led to <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was setting up some sort of hermetic network, on the fabled lines of the Rosicrucians.|$|R
5|$|Karofsky {{is elected}} prom king, and non-candidate Kurt is elected prom queen. Kurt {{runs from the}} gym in humiliation and is consoled by Blaine. Distressed at having lost, Quinn slaps Rachel, though she {{immediately}} regrets it, while Santana is comforted by Brittany, who tells her to be herself rather than hide her lesbian identity. Kurt is able to calm down and return for his coronation; his comment—"Eat your heart out, Kate Middleton"—garners applause that swells into an ovation. Karofsky, abruptly faced with having to publicly dance with another boy in the traditional dance between King and Queen, cannot do it; rejecting Kurt's <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> come out then and there, he instead leaves Kurt alone on the dance floor. Blaine asks Kurt to dance with him, and they are soon joined {{by the rest of}} the student body.|$|E
5|$|The main march southward {{from the}} Bluff depot began on 1 January 1916. Within a few days, one team of three {{was forced to}} return to base, {{following}} the failure of their Primus stove. The other six carried on: Mackintosh, Joyce, Ernest Wild, Dick Richards, Arnold Spencer-Smith and Victor Hayward. The 80° depot laid the previous season was reinforced, and new depots were built at 81° and 82°. As the party moved on towards the vicinity of Mount Hope, both Mackintosh and Spencer-Smith, the expedition's photographer, were hobbling. Shortly after the 83° mark was passed, Spencer-Smith collapsed and was left in a tent while the others struggled on the remaining few miles. Mackintosh rejected the <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should remain with the invalid, insisting {{that it was his}} duty to ensure that every depot was laid. On 26 January, Mount Hope was attained and the final depot put in place.|$|E
25|$|Born in Hounslow, Middlesex, England in 1914, to William John Hartree (1885-1952) and {{his wife}} Alice Hartree (née Crow) (1880-1965) as George Frederick Joffre Hartree, he took his stage name from the {{theatrical}} knight, Sir Charles Hawtrey, and encouraged the <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was his son. However, his father was actually a London car mechanic.|$|E
50|$|Norton's {{final years}} are a mystery. There were <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had left Canada and moved {{as far as}} Laredo, Mexico. His date of death is unknown but his last mention in records was in 1826.|$|R
5000|$|... "Ah, {{just waiting}} to see who'd {{be the first one}} to spot that" [...] - {{whenever}} a member of the platoon makes a good <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> missed, or spots an obvious flaw in one of his plans.|$|R
5000|$|Williams {{produced}} {{commentaries on}} biblical chapters. However, his commentary on John 1 led to <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> sympathized with Sabellianism. In 1791, the matter {{came to a}} head at a Methodist Association at Llandeilo and Williams was expelled.|$|R
25|$|During a {{backstage}} {{meeting with}} trombonist Marshall Brown in 1959, Armstrong received the <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{should go to}} a doctor and receive proper treatment for his lips instead of relying on home remedies, but he didn't get around to doing it until the final years of his life, by which point his health was failing and doctors considered surgery too risky.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd George’s {{accession}} to the Premiership (December 1916) restarted Wilson’s career. In January 1917 Wilson accompanied Lloyd George {{to a conference}} at Rome (Lloyd George had rejected Robertson’s <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> take Haig). Despite the growing alliance between Wilson and the Prime Minister, Wilson was a “Westerner” and agreed with Robertson that British heavy guns should not be sent to Italy or Salonika.|$|E
25|$|At Bernal's {{memorial}} service, Zuckerman downplayed Bernal's {{part in the}} Normandy landings, {{saying he}} was not cleared for {{the highest levels of}} security. Given Bernal's Marxist and pro-Soviet sympathies it is perhaps remarkable that there has never been any <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> fed any information in that direction. But Brown provides evidence of Bernal's contributions to the preparation and the success of the invasion.|$|E
50|$|Glière {{sought the}} {{technical}} {{advice of the}} harpist Ksenia Alexandrovna Erdely (1878-1971). She made so many <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> offered to credit her as co-composer, but she declined. The work was published {{as the work of}} Glière as edited by Erdely.|$|R

5000|$|The NDP were {{defeated}} {{in the general election}} of 1977, and Uruski was re-elected by a reduced margin. [...] There were some <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would run to succeed Schreyer as party leader in 1979, although these ultimately came to nothing.|$|R
25|$|Sometime before 1550 {{he began}} his {{association}} with the Gonzaga family. Most likely around 1550 he moved to Novellara, a town {{in what is now}} the Province of Reggio Emilia, as a musician in the service of a branch of the Gonzagas; a previous <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> may have been in Rome has not been securely established. Novellara in the mid-sixteenth century was a significant musical center under its local branch of the Gonzaga family. Alfonso I built a theatre and staged dramatic performances at his castle, with his young Flemish choirmaster in charge.|$|E
25|$|Boring's minor {{research}} strayed too {{far from}} Titchener's definition of psychology. It was at Titchener's <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> decided to do his thesis on visceral sensibility. He conducted the study by placing a stomach tube in his own stomach {{to learn more about}} the sensations of the alimentary tract. The results indicated that the stomach and esophagus were more sensitive to temperature and pressure than had been realized. The studies indicate his interest, from an early age, in the physical and experimental components of psychology. In 1914, Boring's efforts were rewarded when he received his Ph.D.|$|E
25|$|The most {{remarkable}} {{aspect of the}} censure may be not so much its issuance, or even Spinoza's refusal to submit, {{but the fact that}} Spinoza's expulsion from the Jewish community did not lead to his conversion to Christianity. Spinoza kept the Latin (and so implicitly Christian) name Benedict de Spinoza, maintained a close association with the Collegiants, a Christian sect, even moved to a town near the Collegiants' headquarters, and was buried in a Christian graveyard—but there is no evidence or <b>suggestion</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> ever accepted baptism or participated in a Christian mass. Thus, by default, Baruch de Espinoza became the first secular Jew of modern Europe.|$|E
50|$|Ambler’s pre-war novels contain {{numerous}} passages criticising {{big business}} and capitalism. This, combined with the prominent and friendly role played by KGB agents, led to <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was himself a left-wing sympathiser, claims he was later at pains to play down.|$|R
25|$|On {{the death}} of his father on 12 October 1938, Vladimir assumed the Headship of the Imperial Family of Russia. In 1938 there were <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would be made regent of Ukraine but he rebuffed the idea, saying he would not help {{dissolve}} Russia.|$|R
50|$|Joy {{was one of}} {{the first}} announcers to embrace the Internet. In 1997, he {{encouraged}} Usenet and Jayski readers to e-mail TV coverage <b>suggestions</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> could present in a CBS seminar. A member of many Usenet newsgroups, he read them for preparation for broadcasts.|$|R
