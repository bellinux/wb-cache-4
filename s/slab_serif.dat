25|$|Serif fonts can be broadly {{classified}} {{into one of}} four subgroups: old style, transitional, Didone and <b>slab</b> <b>serif,</b> in order of first appearance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Slab</b> <b>serif</b> typefaces date {{to about}} 1800. Originally {{intended}} as attention-grabbing designs for posters, {{they have very}} thick serifs, {{which tend to be}} as thick as the vertical lines themselves.|$|E
25|$|Old Style typefaces are {{influenced}} by early Italian lettering design. Modern fonts often exhibit a bracketed serif and a substantial difference in weight within the strokes. Though some argument exists as to whether Transitional fonts exist as a discrete category among serif fonts, Transitional fonts lie somewhere between Old Style and Modern style typefaces. Transitional fonts exhibit a marked increase in the variation of stroke weight and a more horizontal serif compared to Old Style. <b>Slab</b> <b>serif</b> designs have particularly large serifs, and date to the early nineteenth century. The earliest <b>slab</b> <b>serif</b> font, Antique, later renamed Egyptian, was first shown in 1815 by the English typefounder Vincent Figgins.|$|E
50|$|Display-oriented <b>slab</b> <b>serifs</b> {{are often}} {{extremely}} bold, intended {{to grab the}} reader's attention on a poster, while <b>slab</b> <b>serifs</b> oriented towards legibility at small sizes show less extreme characteristics. Some fonts oriented towards small print use and printing on poor-quality newsprint paper may have <b>slab</b> <b>serifs</b> to increase legibility, while their other features are closer to conventional book type fonts.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{monoline}} <b>slab</b> <b>serifs</b> such as Serifa, Helserif and Roboto Slab {{have been}} designed {{under the influence of}} neo-grotesque or realist sans-serif fonts of the 1950s and 60s onwards, and these may be called [...] "neo-grotesque" [...] <b>slab</b> <b>serifs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mecane is {{a variety}} of {{typeface}} often used in monospaced fonts. In the VOX-ATypI classification, the Mécanes are very low contrast and rectangular <b>slab</b> <b>serifs.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{practice}} of Kinneir Calvert {{was chosen to}} design the signage for the estate and the World's End Estate in Chelsea. Kinneir Calvert designed the British road sign system. The job involved not just the signing but given the complexity of horizontal and vertical streets intersecting, working out the most efficient addressing system {{for the benefit of}} the postmen and residents. The task was managed be Andrew Haig. The signs used a <b>slab</b> <b>serif</b> version of Margaret Calvert's Rail font, which was later called Calvert and used on the Tyne and Wear Metro in 1980.|$|E
25|$|Because of the clear, bold {{nature of}} the large serifs, <b>slab</b> <b>serif</b> designs are often used for posters and in small print. Many monospace fonts, on which all {{characters}} occupy {{the same amount of}} horizontal space as in a typewriter, are slab-serif designs. While not always purely slab-serif designs, many fonts intended for newspaper use have large slab-like serifs for clearer reading on poor-quality paper. Many early slab-serif types, being intended for posters, only come in bold styles with the key differentiation being width, and often have no lower-case letters at all.|$|E
25|$|Sans serif (lit. without serif) designs {{appeared}} relatively {{recently in}} the history of type design. The first, similar to <b>slab</b> <b>serif</b> designs, was shown in 1816 by William Caslon IV. Sans serif fonts are commonly but not exclusively used for display typography such as signage, headings, and other situations demanding legibility above high readability. The text on electronic media offers an exception to print: most web pages and digitized media are laid out in sans serif typefaces because serifs often detract from readability at the low resolution of displays. Many have minimal variation in stroke width, creating the impression of a minimal, simplified design.|$|E
5000|$|Memphis has an Egyptian name, in {{reference}} to the fact that early <b>slab</b> <b>serifs</b> were often called [...] "Egyptians" [...] as an exoticism by nineteenth-century typefounders.|$|R
50|$|A {{considerable}} {{variety of}} other names have been used, particularly in the 19th century: {{at the time the}} separation between typeface name and genre had yet to become established, so it is not clear if a name describes a specific typeface or is meant to refer to a subgenre. For example, <b>slab</b> <b>serifs</b> on the French Clarendon model were also called 'Celtic', 'Belgian', 'Aldine' and 'Teutonic' by American printers, as well as 'Tuscan', a name which refers to <b>slab</b> <b>serifs</b> with diamond-shaped points {{on the sides of the}} letterform.|$|R
5000|$|Like Memphis, Karnak has a name, {{after the}} Karnak Temple Complex in Egypt, in {{reference}} to the fact that early <b>slab</b> <b>serifs</b> were often called [...] "Egyptians" [...] as an exoticism by nineteenth-century typefounders.|$|R
25|$|A reverse-contrast type is a {{typeface}} {{in which}} the stress is reversed from the norm: instead of the vertical lines being the same width or thicker than horizontals, which is normal in Latin-alphabet printing, the horizontal lines are the thickest. Reverse-contrast types are rarely used for body text, and are particularly common in display applications such as headings and posters, {{in which the}}ir unusual structure may be particularly eye-catching. First seen in London in 1821, they were particularly common in the mid- to late nineteenth century in American and British printing and have been revived occasionally since then. They effectively become <b>slab</b> <b>serif</b> designs because of the serifs becoming thick, and are often characterised {{as part of that}} genre. In recent times, the reverse-contrast effect has been extended to other kinds of typeface, such as sans-serif designs.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Slab</b> <b>serif</b> fonts vary considerably: {{some such}} as Rockwell have a {{geometric}} design with minimal variation in stroke width: they are sometimes described as sans-serif fonts with added serifs. Others {{such as those of}} the [...] "Clarendon" [...] model have a structure more like most other serif fonts, though with larger and more obvious serifs. These designs may have bracketed serifs that increase width along their length.|$|E
2500|$|The format switch was {{accompanied}} by a comprehensive redesign of the paper's look. On Friday, 9 September 2005, the newspaper unveiled its newly designed front page, which débuted on Monday 12 September 2005. Designed by Mark Porter, the new look includes a new masthead for the newspaper, its first since 1988. A typeface family designed by Paul Barnes and Christian Schwartz was created for the new design. With just over 200 fonts, it is [...] "one of the most ambitious custom type programs ever commissioned by a newspaper". Especially notable is Guardian Egyptian, a highly legible <b>slab</b> <b>serif</b> that is used in various weights for both text and headlines and is central to the redesign.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} terms {{have been}} used for Clarendons and related <b>slab</b> <b>serifs.</b> Common meanings have been added, but they have often not been consistently applied. Many modern writers as a result ignore them and prefer the term slab-serif, providing individual descriptions of the features of specific designs.|$|R
50|$|Clarendon typefaces, {{unlike other}} <b>slab</b> <b>serifs,</b> {{actually}} have some bracketing and some contrast in {{size in the}} actual serif: the serifs often have curves so they change width and become wider as they approach the main stroke of the letter. Many again have similarity to 19th century serif font designs, with considerable variation in stroke width between vertical and horizontal strokes. Examples include Clarendon and Egyptienne.|$|R
50|$|<b>Slab</b> <b>serifs</b> form a {{large and}} varied genre. Some such as Memphis and Rockwell have a {{geometric}} design with minimal variation in stroke width: they are sometimes described as sans-serif fonts with added serifs. Others {{such as those of}} the Clarendon genre have a structure more like most other serif fonts, though with larger and more obvious serifs. These designs may have bracketed serifs which increase width along their length before merging with the main strokes of the letters, while on geometrics the serifs have a constant width.|$|R
2500|$|Lettering {{and type}} design {{featured}} {{prominently in the}} graphic style of the Festival and was overseen by a typography panel including the lettering historian Nicolete Gray. A typeface for the Festival, Festival Titling, was specially commissioned and designed by Philip Boydell. It was based on condensed sans-serif capitals and had a three-dimensional form making it suitable for use in exhibition display typography. It has been said to bear [...] "a vague resemblance to bunting". [...] The lettering on the Royal Festival Hall and the temporary Festival building on the South Bank was a bold, sloping <b>slab</b> <b>serif</b> letter form, determined by Gray and her colleagues, including Charles Hasler and Gordon Cullen, illustrated in Gray’s Lettering on Buildings (1960). [...] It {{has been described as}} a [...] "turn to a jauntier and more decorative visual language" [...] that was [...] "part of a wider move towards the appreciation of vernacular arts and the peculiarities of English culture". [...] The lettering in the Lion and Unicorn Pavilion was designed by John Brinkley.|$|E
50|$|<b>Slab</b> <b>serif</b> fonts {{were also}} {{often used in}} typewriters, most famously Courier, and this {{tradition}} has meant many monospaced text fonts intended for computer and programming use are <b>slab</b> <b>serif</b> designs.|$|E

5000|$|As many of Gill's {{faces and}} {{lettering}} projects show characteristic features, many of Gill's other families {{are similar in}} spirit. Joanna has similarities to Perpetua but a more robust colour on the page with regular <b>slab</b> <b>serifs</b> and an only slightly slanted italic; Gill described it as [...] "a book face free from all fancy business". Gill's family for the Golden Cockerel Press, which has been digitised as ITC Golden Cockerel, also has similarities. Monotype's Gill Facia family from the digital period, reviving Gill's lettering projects such as for WH Smith, is a more festive and decorative family in the same style particularly intended for display-size text.|$|R
5000|$|The direct {{ancestor}} of Bookmans were several fonts from around 1869 named [...] "Old Style Antique" [...] {{intended as a}} bold complement to the original Old Style face. [...] "Antique" [...] was a common name given to bolder typefaces of the time, now often called <b>slab</b> <b>serifs,</b> and identifies the aim of creating a complementary bolder design on the oldstyle model for uses such as emphasis and headings. However, the old style antique fonts also became used for extended body text use. Although Old Style Antique faces were bolder than Old Style, {{the difference was not}} great enough that they could not be used for body text.|$|R
5000|$|Joanna {{is based}} on the {{traditional}} old-style serif model of the Renaissance. However, the spare, sharp squared serifs and minimal contrast of strokes give the design a 20th-century modernist feeling, reminiscent of the <b>slab</b> <b>serifs</b> of the nineteenth century but far lighter than most typefaces of this genre. This is very similar to Gill's earlier typeface Solus, in many ways a predecessor to Joanna, in which Gill intended to create a design inspired by the basic structure of slab-serifs of the nineteenth century, with their almost-monoline structure and simple block serifs, but adapted to be suitable for body text. (Solus was never particularly popular, perhaps because it did not have an italic.) ...|$|R
50|$|Karnak was an {{influence}} {{on the design of}} the popular 2009 <b>slab</b> <b>serif</b> Neutraface Slab. It is an adaptation of the sans-serif Neutraface designed by Christian Schwartz, influenced by Middleton's Tempo. Archer is another well-known modern geometric <b>slab</b> <b>serif</b> in this style with a less strictly geometric design.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Slab</b> <b>serifs</b> {{declined}} {{following the}} growing popularity of sans-serif faces, with which they always competed, and the revival of interest in old-style serif fonts as part of the Arts and Crafts movement. However, they have been regularly revived and redesigned since the nineteenth century both in modernised forms and in retro use inspired by the exuberance of Victorian design, a style of design known as Victoriana. Notable collections of original wood type are held by the Hamilton in Wisconsin and the University of Texas at Austin, collected by Rob Roy Kelly, writer of a well-known book on American poster types. Adobe Systems has released a large collection of digitisations inspired by nineteenth-century wood type.|$|R

2500|$|The {{standard}} font, unofficially {{known as}} Charles Wright 2001, is a subtly redrawn version of Charles Wright's original 1935 font. The {{width of the}} previous font was condensed from 57mm to 50mm to allow space for the extra letter and the optional blue EU strip. The letter O and the digit 0 are intentionally identical, as are the letter I and digit 1. But the typeface accentuates the differences between characters such as 8 and B, or D and 0, with <b>slab</b> <b>serifs</b> to improve the legibility of a plate from a distance. This is especially useful for the automatic number plate recognition software of speed cameras and CCTV. This accentuation also discourages the tampering that is sometimes practised {{with the use of}} black insulating tape or paint to change letter forms (such as P to R, or 9 to 8), or with the inclusion of carefully positioned black [...] "fixing screw" [...] dots that alter the appearance of letters on some vanity plates.|$|R

50|$|It {{was cut in}} 1911 for the {{publisher}} J. M. Dent, {{the owner of the}} Everyman's Library. It was based on another foundry-type made for this publisher. Both founts were based on an old Venetian roman type made by Nicolas Jenson. The typeface was launched in 1912 in a collection of the poems of Lorenzo De Medici which was published by Ballantyne Press.This font was also the basis for William Morris and his Golden Type. Dent admired Morris and his Golden type, and the way Morris tried to implement his ideas on printing. Dent however wanted to use machines to produce the type for his trade editions.The font Monotype produced was almost a copy of Golden Type, but with sharper <b>slab</b> <b>serifs,</b> and cleaner lines. A lighter version was produced in 1919 after the First World War, with bracketed serifs, and named Italian Old Style series 108. In 1967 the font was taken out off production and all patterns, designs and punches were destroyed. After this date no new mats could be made anymore. However, several digital fonts based on Veronese are currently available.|$|R
5000|$|The label [...] "Ionic", {{originally}} {{also used}} for display faces, has become associated with typefaces with some Clarendon/slab-serif features but intended for body text, following the success of several faces with this name from first Miller & Richard (intended to be slightly bolder than contemporary expectations for body text proportions) and then Linotype (its 1922 release Ionic No. 5, extremely successful in newspaper printing). Millington notes that [...] "Ionic became a distinct design in its own right" [...] while Hoefler comments {{that it is now}} [...] "chiefly associated with bracketed faces of the Century model". A decline of interest in Clarendons for display use did, however, take place in the early twentieth century: by 1923, American Type Founders, which specialised in creating demand for new designs of display face, could argue [...] "Who remembers the Clarendons?" [...] in its specimen book, and did not show them (aside from a few numerals) in its 1,148 pages. In addition, the market of <b>slab</b> <b>serifs</b> was disrupted by the arrival of new [...] "geometric" [...] slab-serifs inspired by the sans-serifs of the period, such as Karnak and Beton. However, revivals did appear after the war both in America and Europe.|$|R
50|$|For {{the first}} centuries of {{printing}}, display type did not exist, with printing principally used for body text, with occasional larger titles and ornamented letters. Large size-typefaces were first used for purposes such as book titles and then developed as printing {{began to be}} used for posters and signs. Historian James Mosley has written that “big types had been cast in sand, using wooden patterns, for some centuries 1750 but there is evidence that English typefounders only began to make big letters for posters and other commercial printing towards 1770, when Thomas Cottrell made his 'Proscription or Posting letter of great bulk and dimension' and William Caslon II cast his 'Patagonian' or 'Proscription letters’.” The arrival of the poster spurred new designs of printed letter, such as sans-serifs (already used in custom lettering but effectively unused in printing before the 1830s), “fat face” Didone typefaces, and <b>slab</b> <b>serifs,</b> as well as the pre-existing blackletter styles already used both in printing and in signpainting. Many nineteenth-century display typefaces were extremely, aggressively bold and condensed in order to attract attention. Equally, some display typefaces such as Cochin and Koch-Antiqua have a particularly delicate build with a low x-height, and this style was very popular around the start of the twentieth century.|$|R
