40|$|In {{aiming to}} {{understand}} how structures, such as rules, norms, and routines, establish inside orga-nizations, scholars now focus their explanation on practitioners who enact a multitude of behavioral logics. Studies adopting this institutional logic perspective apply assumptions about the apparency and dominance of logics and consequently cannot adequately explain, with empirical evidence, how logics coexist or compete for dominance among practitioners. To fill this gap, we open these concepts up to recent academic inquiry as to the dominant logics that practitioners enact. In so doing, we address the still unanswered call by Von Krogh and Roos to collect empirical evidence on dominant logics by operationalizing two concepts: self-reference and self-similarity. We introduce a methodology that involves causal mapping enhanced with statistical tests and graphical approaches. Through an empirical investigation, we show how this method provides the enacted patterns of mul-tiple logics, validates their dominance, and detects internal contradictions and inconsistencies. These findings highlight that if one defines dominant logics in terms of self-reference and self-similarity, cau-sal mapping then generates competing and coexisting logics that practitioners enact. Keywords dominant logic, self-reference, self-similarity, organizational research, managerial cognition In order to develop competitive advantage, organizations need to continuously adapt to dynamic out-side pressure. For this reason, much {{attention has been paid}} in organizations on the institutional approach as a way of explaining how managers can effectively establish structures such as rules, strategies, and norms to direct practitioners â€™ behavior (Scott, 2004).

40|$|As hip hop slowly {{settles into}} middle age, the pitched battles of its younger years have frozen in a stalemate. Critics of hip hop {{repeat the same}} attacks they leveled at NWA, decrying violence, misogyny, and {{homophobia}} in hip-hop lyrics, and in the most extreme cases branding its creators as Typhoid Marys for a particularly virulent social pathology. Defenders respond with rebuttals codified in the early 1990 s, lauding the aesthetic value and social relevance of their favorite corners of the hip-hop world, eliding any problems inherent in the rest, and questioning the true motives of hip hop's critics. As Tricia Rose tells it, these arguments have remained essentially static, even as hip hop experienced two remarkable-though opposing-developments. First, hip hop expanded. The dress, music, dance, and visual style that {{grew up in the}} South Bronx not only took hold throughout American culture, but throughout cultures of the world. Within the US media landscape, hip hop music, fashion, and visual aesthetics became ubiquitous. Outside of the US, local hip-hop movements emerged around the world, whether {{in the form of a}} few MCs in a bedroom reciting Tupac lyrics in English, or a full-fledged scene in a local language and style. Remaining closely identified with urban, black youth (in ways that Rose describes as sometimes quite unhealthy), hip hop has become an aspect of self-definition for a widespread and diverse group of people, many of whom identify as part of the "Hip-Hop Generation " united less by a period of birth than by a set of shared cultural practices (Kitwana 2002). Thanks in no small part to Rose herself, hip hop has also found a home in the academy. The "Hip-Hop University " that began with <b>scholars</b> <b>lik...</b>|$|E
