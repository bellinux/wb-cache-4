40|$|AbstractAt present, it is {{difficult}} to accurately forecast the water inrush from coal <b>seam</b> <b>floor.</b> For safety, it is necessary to monitor and predict water inrush. Rock angular displacement can be observed easily and can show whether the coal <b>seam</b> <b>floor</b> has bent and destroyed or not.

In the study of water inrush mechanism, scholars have carried out a lot of research work and proposed water inrush theory and criteria such as water inrush coefficient method (Peng et al. 2003), water inrush critical index method, “lower three zone” theory (Li 1999), in situ tensile and zero failure theory (Wang et al. 1994), board model theory (Zhang and Wang 2006), key strata theory (Qian et al. 1996), mutation and nonlinear model (Yang et al. 2001, 2005), water inrush advantage theory, water inrush power information theory, strong seepage theory (Ye and Liu 2005), similar theory, rock-water stress theory and so on, and formed water inrush prevention and control methods such as waterproof coal pillar mining (Jiang et al. 2008), double down (Miao et al. 2008, 2009), bottom grouting etc. Some scholars studied the change of rock permeability in the process of rock deformation and failure through rock stress and permeability coupling experiment (Oda et al. 2002; Noiriel et al. 2010; Watanabe et al. 2011). At present, these research results play a positive role in guiding the control of water inrush from coal <b>seam</b> <b>floor.</b> But there are some obvious weaknesses such as studying the rock and water separately or directly considering the confined water pressure to be hydrostatic pressure to floor, ignoring the interaction between seepage field and stress field.

Scholars both at home and abroad have been doing extensive and in-depth research for the evolution rules of stress, strain and permeability in the process of rock seepage experiment. Some articles have presented the rock coupling seepage rule through experiments (Zheng et al. 1999; Zhu and Liu 2002) and summed up the empirical formula between rock permeability characteristics and effective stress.

The practical criterion of water inrush was put forward. The results show that the rock permeability “mutation” phenomenon reflects the differences of stress state and cracks extension rate when the rock internal crack begins to extend in large-scale. The rock ultimate destruction form is related to the rock lithology and the angle between crack and principal stress. The necessary condition of floor water inrush is that the mining pressure leads to the extension and transfixion of the crack. The sufficient condition of floor water inrush is that the confined water’s expansionary stress in normal direction and shear stress in tangential direction must be larger than the internal stress in the crack.
