So merely stopping over night that time in St. Louis, I sped on westward. As I cross'd Missouri State the whole distance by the St. Louis and Kansas City Northern Railroad, a fine early autumn day, I thought my eyes had never looked on scenes of greater pastoral beauty. For over two hundred miles successive rolling prairies, agriculturally perfect view'd by Pennsylvania and New Jersey eyes, and dotted here and there with fine timber. Yet fine as the land is, it isn't the finest portion; (there is a bed of impervious clay and hard-pan beneath this section that holds water too firmly, [...] "drowns the land in wet weather, and bakes it in dry," [...] as a cynical farmer told me.) South are some richer tracts, though perhaps the beauty-spots of the State are the northwestern counties. Altogether, I am clear, (now, and from what I have seen and learn'd since,) that Missouri, in climate, soil, relative situation, wheat, grass, mines, railroads, and every important materialistic respect, stands in the front rank of the Union. Of Missouri averaged politically and <b>socially</b> <b>I</b> have heard all sorts of talk, some pretty severe--but I should have no fear myself of getting along safely and comfortably anywhere among the Missourians.

Coming from a working-class socialist background, Hawley disagreed with many of the policies of the Conservative Party which became the dominant party in the coalition government following the 2010 general election, saying [...] "I think I started writing when the Tories got in - it influenced a lot of the first song which was 'Down in the Woods'.

40|$|Natural {{language}} is characterised by enormous linguistic variation (e. g., Fetzer (2003)). Such variation is not random, but {{is determined by}} a number of contextual factors. These factors encapsulate the socio-cultural conventions of a speech community and dictate the <b>socially</b> acceptable, <b>i.</b> e. polite, use of language. Producing polite language may not always be a trivial task. The ability to assess a situation with respect to a hearer's social, cultural or emotional needs constitutes a crucial facet of a speaker's social and linguistic competence.

40|$|Many {{animals are}} known to learn <b>socially,</b> <b>i.</b> e. {{they are able to}} acquire new {{behaviours}} by using information from other individuals. Researchers distinguish between a number of different social-learning mechanisms such as imitation and social enhancement. Social enhancement is a simple form of social learning that is among the most widespread in animals. However, unlike imitation, it is debated whether social enhancement can create cultural traditions. Based on a recent study on capuchin monkeys, we developed an agent-based model to test the hypotheses that (i) social enhancement can create and maintain stable traditions and (ii) social enhancement can create cultural conformity. Our results supported both hypotheses. A key factor that {{led to the creation of}} cultural conformity and traditions was the repeated interaction of individual reinforcement and social enhancement learning. This result emphasizes that the emergence of cultural conformity does not necessarily require cognitively complex mechanisms such as ‘copying the majority’ or group norms. In addition, we observed that social enhancement can create learning dynamics similar to a ‘copy when uncertain’ learning strategy. Results from additional analyses also point to situations that should favour the evolution of learning mechanisms more sophisticated than social enhancement...|$|E

The internship is about two Land Change Modeler projects which conducted by Esri. The first one is a cloud-based Land Change Model on ArcGIS online for professional change analysts. Another one is a free cloud-based App for land change analysts and the public to explore land change of 48 states in United State. This work mainly relied on TerrSet skills and Land Change Modeler skills. As an GIS analyst, my responsibilities were data extraction, preparation, and modeling test. In June 6 th, I started my internship at Clark Labs, and am continuing work till now. I think I gained a lot GIS and non-GIS experience during this time period.

40|$|Agents can {{be thought}} of as {{following}} a social be-haviour, depending on the context in which they are interacting. We devise a computationally grounded mechanism to represent and reason about others in social terms, reflecting the local perspective of an agent (first-person view), to support both stereotyp-ical and empathetic reasoning. We use a hierarchy of agent models to discriminate which behaviours of others are plausible, and decide which behaviour for ourselves is <b>socially</b> acceptable, <b>i.</b> e. conforms to the social context. To this aim, we investigate the implications of considering agents capable of various degrees of theory of mind, and discuss a scenario showing how this affects behaviour. ...|$|R
