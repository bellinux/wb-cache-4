500|$|A forward <b>sortation</b> area (FSA) is a {{geographical}} region {{in which all}} postal codes start with the same three characters. The first letter of an FSA code denotes a particular [...] "postal district", which, outside of Quebec and Ontario, corresponds to an entire province or territory.|$|E
500|$|A Canadian {{postal code}} is a six-character string that forms {{part of a}} postal address in Canada. Like British and Dutch postcodes, Canada's postal codes are alphanumeric. They are in the format A1A 1A1, where A is a letter and 1 is a digit, with a space {{separating}} {{the third and fourth}} characters. [...] As of September 2014, there were 855,815 postal codes using Forward <b>Sortation</b> Areas from A0A on Newfoundland to Y1A in Yukon.|$|E
500|$|LDUs {{ending in}} zero {{correspond}} to postal facilities, from post offices and small franchised retail postal outlets {{all the way}} up to <b>sortation</b> plants. In urban areas, LDUs may be specific postal carriers' routes. In rural areas where direct door-to-door delivery is not available, an LDU can describe a set of post office boxes or a rural route. [...] LDU 9Z9 is used exclusively for Business Reply Mail. In rural FSAs, the first two characters are usually assigned in alphanumerical order by the name of each community.|$|E
2500|$|The provincial line {{divides the}} city in two aspects related to communications. [...] Telephones on the Saskatchewan side are {{assigned}} to area codes 306 and 639, the two area codes assigned to that province, while land lines on the Alberta side have numbers in the 780 and 587 area codes, the two area codes assigned to northern Alberta. [...] Similarly, Saskatchewan addresses have a postal code with a forward <b>sortation</b> area designation (first three characters) of [...] "S9V", and addresses in Alberta have postal codes beginning with [...] "T9V". [...] All postal codes in Canada beginning with the letter [...] "S" [...] are assigned to Saskatchewan, and those beginning with [...] "T" [...] belong to Alberta.|$|E
5000|$|In logistics, a sorter (sorting system, <b>sortation</b> system) is {{a system}} which {{performs}} <b>sortation</b> of products (goods, luggage, mail, etc.) according to their destinations.|$|E
50|$|The forward <b>sortation</b> {{area for}} the community's postal code is B2X.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: The {{west side}} of Shaw NDC, in 1990, before the {{construction}} of a purpose-built packing and <b>sortation</b> facility (on the wasteland).|$|E
5000|$|Dynamically assign cartons {{to divert}} {{locations}} based on defined <b>sortation</b> algorithms or based on routing/order information {{received from the}} Host (if applicable).|$|E
50|$|WES {{emerged as}} a hybrid system that {{combined}} specific WMS functionality with Warehouse Control System (WCS) functionality for automated warehouses. WCS is the software that controls the movement of cases, cartons, totes or pallets on conveyor and <b>sortation</b> systems. In automated warehouses that deploy those types of material handling equipment, WES adds business process logic to the almost real-time WCS data. Because WES is tightly integrated with automated systems such as conveyors, <b>sortation,</b> pick-to-light, etc., it has near real-time visibility into bottleneck issues.|$|E
50|$|Postal {{service is}} {{provided}} by Canada Post; King City's Forward <b>Sortation</b> Area is L7B. UPS and Federal Express both provide weekday service to King City.|$|E
5000|$|A tilt-tray sorter is a continuous-loop <b>sortation</b> {{conveyor}} {{that uses}} a technique of tilting a tray at a chute to slide the object into the chute.|$|E
50|$|The only named {{community}} {{within the}} township is Gros Cap. Most mail and telephone {{service in the}} township is part of Sault Ste. Marie's <b>sortation</b> area and telephone exchange.|$|E
5000|$|In logistics, a {{cross belt}} sorter is type of conveyor-based <b>sortation</b> system. Basically, it {{consists}} of a chain of independently operated short conveyor belts mounted transversely along the main track.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sortation,</b> or sorting systems: {{similar to}} {{conveyors}} but typically have higher capacity and can divert containers more quickly. Typically used to distribute high volumes of small cartons {{to a large}} set of locations.|$|E
50|$|As of 2016, LaserShip has 63 {{distribution}} {{centers and}} four <b>sortation</b> centers servicing 22 states and Washington, D.C.. Lasership handles deliveries for Amazon {{and others from}} New England to Florida, specifically Amazon's Same Day Service.|$|E

50|$|The postal forward <b>sortation</b> area is N0A; sharing its Canada Post {{service with}} the western portion of Haldimand County. All residences and {{businesses}} within the Port Dover area have a 583 in their phone number.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, Teklogix {{was awarded}} a {{contract}} from Canada Post to control a tilt-tray mail sorter system. The company went on to be a primary supplier of <b>sortation</b> and conveyor control systems for the next decade.|$|E
50|$|In 1981 Emery Worldwide {{completed}} an air freight hub <b>sortation</b> facility next to Runway 6L-24R. Emery {{added to the}} facility until the early 1990s, {{making it one of}} the world's largest air freight facilities at the time.|$|E
50|$|A modern WMS will {{connect to}} a variety of {{communication}} technologies (radio frequency), automatic ID technologies (Bar code, RFID, etc.), mobile computers, and occasionally automated material handling (conveyors and <b>sortation)</b> and storage equipment (carousels, automatic storage and retrieval, etc.).|$|E
5000|$|Automated [...] processing: Combining {{knowledge}} of all orders {{placed at the}} warehouse the automation system can assign picked goods into dispatch units and then into outbound loads. <b>Sortation</b> systems and conveyors can then move these onto the outgoing trailers.|$|E
5000|$|Automated {{goods in}} processes: Incoming goods can be marked with {{barcodes}} and the automation system notified {{of the expected}} stock. On arrival, the goods can be scanned and thereby identified, and taken via conveyors, <b>sortation</b> systems, and automated cranes into an automatically assigned storage location.|$|E
50|$|However, in {{many respects}} it {{continued}} {{to be treated as}} a distinct community, rather than as part of the city — for example, postal service in Copper Cliff was never integrated into the city's urban forward <b>sortation</b> areas. Instead, Copper Cliff retained a rural P0M postal code.|$|E
5000|$|A forward <b>sortation</b> area (FSA) is a {{geographical}} region {{in which all}} postal codes start with the same three characters.

50|$|In 2014 Toll, in {{conjunction}} with Australia Pacific Airports, announced they were building a $150 million, a 71,000 square metre facility next to Melbourne Airport. The facility has been custom-designed and will have a highly specialised <b>sortation</b> system that will triple the parcel sorting capacity to 35,000 parcels per hour, specifically increasing the capability of Toll Consumer Delivery.|$|E
50|$|The {{population}} growth continued. Early in the 1980s general delivery {{to the population}} became less and less feasible. In 1982 post office boxes were offered, {{and later in the}} decade carrier service to residents was finally implemented, with Yellowknife's original postal code of X0E 1H0 ended gradually and replaced with the current X1A Forward <b>Sortation</b> Code.|$|E
50|$|Many {{items are}} shipped {{individually}} (in part or entirely) by express carrier, mail, or other mixed logistics systems. The demands of multiple manual handlings, automated <b>sortation,</b> and uncontrolled stacking in trucks or air containers put severe stress on boxes, box closures, and the contents. Boxes designed for unit load handling and storage {{may not be}} suited to mixed logistics systems.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the primary}} {{function}} of a BHS is the transportation of bags, a typical BHS will serve other functions involved {{in making sure that}} a bag gets to the correct location in the airport. The process of identifying a bag, and the information associated with it, to make a decision on where the bag should be directed within the system is known as <b>sortation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many {{organizations}} {{find that}} by commingling multiple smaller print streams before printing into one larger stream (or a few larger streams, sorted by criteria such as weight or number of inserts) they can gain efficiencies and reduce overall postage costs. During this electronic commingling process IMBs {{can be added}} to the documents and mail pieces in the new stream(s). This is an option to in-house <b>sortation.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{community}} is {{located within the}} 905 area code for telephones and the postal forward <b>sortation</b> area in this region is L0R. Dundas Hill is located nearby, signifying its closeness to Dundas. The {{community is}} located 35 mi away from Mississauga and 40 mi away from Toronto. Copetown is also a short eastbound drive away from Flamboro Downs and is located relatively close to downtown Dundas.|$|E
50|$|Automated {{conveyor}} systems transport trays of mail to automated mail processing equipment and manual or special handling workstations. The conveyors read the bar code labels on the trays and then transport {{them to the}} desired destination. When the mail is sorted on the automated mail <b>sortation</b> equipment, the letter destination image is lifted by high speed optical cameras. Both inbound and outbound mail are then automatically sorted into groups.|$|E
