25|$|The {{nomenclature}} for paclitaxel {{is structured}} on a tetracyclic 17-carbon (heptadecane) skeleton. There are {{a total of}} 11 stereocenters. The active <b>stereoisomer</b> is (−)-paclitaxel (shown here).|$|E
25|$|Zopiclone, as {{traditionally}} sold worldwide, is a {{racemic mixture}} of two stereoisomers, {{only one of}} which is active. In 2005, the pharmaceutical company Sepracor of Marlborough, Massachusetts began marketing the active <b>stereoisomer</b> eszopiclone under the name Lunesta in the United States. This had the consequence of placing what is a generic drug in most of the world under patent control in the United States. Although it was expected to be available in generic form by 2010, no generic has become available there at present. However, zopiclone is currently available off-patent in a number of European countries, as well as Brazil, Canada, and Hong Kong. The eszopiclone/zopiclone difference is in the dosagethe strongest eszopiclone derivative dosage contains 3mg of the therapeutic <b>stereoisomer,</b> whereas the highest zopiclone dosage (7.5mg) contains 3.75mg of the active <b>stereoisomer.</b> The two agents have not yet been studied in head-to-head clinical trials to determine the existence of any potential clinical differences (efficacy, side effects, developing dependence on the drug, safety, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Dextromethorphan (the <b>stereoisomer</b> of levomethorphan, a semi-synthetic opioid agonist) and its {{metabolite}} dextrorphan have no {{opioid analgesic}} effect at all despite their structural similarity to other opioids; instead they are potent NMDA antagonists and sigma 1 and 2-receptor agonists {{and are used}} in many over-the-counter cough suppressants.|$|E
25|$|A {{widely used}} method is the Evans' acyl oxazolidinone method. Developed {{in the late}} 1970s and 1980s by David A. Evans and coworkers, the method works by {{temporarily}} creating a chiral enolate by appending a chiral auxiliary. The pre-existing chirality from the auxiliary is then transferred to the aldol adduct by performing a diastereoselective aldol reaction. Upon subsequent removal of the auxiliary, the desired aldol <b>stereoisomer</b> is revealed.|$|E
25|$|The <b>stereoisomer</b> D-phenylalanine (DPA) can be {{produced}} by conventional organic synthesis, either as a single enantiomer or {{as a component of}} the racemic mixture. It does not participate in protein biosynthesis although it is found in proteins in small amounts - particularly aged proteins and food proteins that have been processed. The biological functions of D-amino acids remain unclear, although D-phenylalanine has pharmacological activity at niacin receptor 2.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{zopiclone}} is not commercially available, {{although its}} active <b>stereoisomer,</b> eszopiclone, is sold {{under the name}} Lunesta. Zopiclone is a controlled substance in the United States, Japan, Brazil, and some European countries, and may be illegal to possess without a prescription. However, it is readily available in other countries where it is marketed under the brand name Imovane, {{and is not a}} controlled substance in its available 7.5mg, 5mg, and 3.75mg oral tablet formulations.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{derivative}} of gramicidin, {{produced by the}} gram-positive bacterium Bacillus brevis. Gramicidin S is a cyclodecapeptide, constructed as two identical pentapeptides joined head to tail, formally written as cyclo(-Val-Orn-Leu-D-Phe-Pro-)2. That is to say, it forms a ring structure composed of five different amino acids, each one used twice within the structure. Another interesting point is that it utilizes two amino acids uncommon in peptides: ornithine {{as well as the}} atypical <b>stereoisomer</b> of phenylalanine. It is synthesized by gramicidin S synthetase.|$|E
25|$|Transplatin, the trans <b>stereoisomer</b> of cisplatin, has formula trans- {{and does}} not exhibit a comparably useful {{pharmacological}} effect. Two mechanisms have been suggested to explain the reduced anticancer effect of transplatin. Firstly, the trans arrangement of the chloro ligands is thought to confer transplatin with greater chemical reactivity, causing transplatin to become deactivated before it reaches the DNA where transplatin exerts its pharmacological action. Secondly, the stereo-conformation of transplatin is such that it is unable to form the characteristic 1,2-intrastand d(GpG) adducts formed by cisplatin in abundance.|$|E

2500|$|The enzymes {{cyclooxygenase}} 1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), {{which are}} {{best known for}} metabolizing arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, are also able to metabolize linoleic acid predominantly to 9(R)-hydroperoxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (i.e. 9(R)-HpODE)-HODE) and lesser amounts of 9(S)-hydroperoxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (i.e. 9(S)-HpODE); in cells and tissues, the two hydroperoxy metabolites are rapidly reduce to 9(R)-HODE and 9(S)-HODE, respectively. [...] COX-2 exhibits a greater preference for linoleic acid than does Cox-1 and is therefore credited with producing most of these products in cells expressing both COX enzymes. [...] The COXs also metabolize linoleic acid to 13(S)-hydroperoxy-octadecadionoic acid (13(S)-HpODE and lesser amounts of 13(R)-hydroperoxy-octadecadienoic acid (13(R)-HpODE, which are then rapidly reduced to 13(S)-HODE) and 13(R)-HODE; the two enzymes therefore metabolize linoleic acid predominantly to the R <b>stereoisomer</b> of 9-HODE and (S) <b>stereoisomer</b> of 13-HODE with the 13-HODE products predominating over the 9-HODE products.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{an excess}} of one <b>stereoisomer</b> can be observed, as the leaving group can remain in {{proximity}} to the carbocation intermediate {{for a short time}} and block nucleophilic attack. [...] This stands in contrast to the SN2 mechanism, which is a stereospecific mechanism where stereochemistry is always inverted as the nucleophile comes in from the rear side of the leaving group.|$|E
2500|$|Lutein is {{isomeric}} with zeaxanthin, differing only in {{the placement}} of one double bond. The principal natural <b>stereoisomer</b> of lutein is -beta,epsilon-carotene-3,3-diol. Lutein is a lipophilic molecule and is generally insoluble in water. The presence of the long chromophore of conjugated double bonds (polyene chain) provides the distinctive light-absorbing properties. [...] The polyene chain is susceptible to oxidative degradation by light or heat and is chemically unstable in acids.|$|E
2500|$|Such {{reactions}} usually involve an aqueous acidic workup, {{though this}} step is rarely shown in reaction schemes. [...] In cases where the Grignard reagent is adding to an aldehyde or a prochiral ketone, the Felkin-Anh model or Cram's Rule can usually predict which <b>stereoisomer</b> will be formed. [...] With easily deprotonated 1,3-diketones and related acidic substrates, the Grignard reagent RMgX functions merely as a base, giving the enolate anion and liberating the alkane RH.|$|E
2500|$|Cytochrome P450 microsomal enzymes metabolize {{linoleic}} acid to {{a mixture of}} 9(S)-HpODE and 9(R)-HpODE which are subsequently reduced to their corresponding hydroxy products; these reactions produce racemic mixtures in which the R <b>stereoisomer</b> predominates, for instance by a R/S ratio of 80%/20% in human liver microsomes. [...] In cells and tissues, the cytochrome enzymes concurrently metabolize {{linoleic acid}} to 13(S)-HpODE and 13(R)-HpODE which are reduced to 13(S)-HODE and 13(R)-HODE in an R/S ratio similar to than of the 9-HODES, i.e. 80%/20%.|$|E
2500|$|Vitamin K1, the {{precursor}} of most vitamin K in nature, is a <b>stereoisomer</b> of phylloquinone, an important chemical in green plants, where it functions as an electron acceptor in photosystem I during photosynthesis. For this reason, vitamin K1 {{is found in}} large quantities in the photosynthetic tissues of plants (green leaves, and dark green leafy vegetables such as romaine lettuce, kale and spinach), but it occurs in far smaller quantities in other plant tissues (roots, fruits, etc.). Iceberg lettuce contains relatively little. The function of phylloquinone in plants appears to have no resemblance to its later metabolic and biochemical function (as [...] "vitamin K") in animals, where it performs a completely different biochemical reaction.|$|E
2500|$|Pyrene is a {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbon}} consisting of four benzene rings fused together in a planar aromatic arrangement which approximates a rhombus in shape. [...] Benzopyrene is a derivative in which a fifth benzene ring has been fused to the pyrene system, and is a component of tobacco smoke which is a procarcinogen {{partly responsible for the}} carcinogenic and mutagenic effects of smoking. [...] Benzopyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide is a metabolite of benzopyrene formed by the introduction of vicinal hydroxyl and epoxide functional groups to the fifth benzene ring. [...] These oxidations are stereoselective, producing the pair of enantiomers with the hydroxyl groups {{on opposite sides of the}} pyrene plane and with the epoxide on the same side as its adjacent hydroxyl group. [...] (+)-Benzopyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide is specifically the (7R,8S,8aR,9aS) <b>stereoisomer.</b>|$|E
2500|$|ALOX15 and Alox15 enzymes are non-heme, iron-containing dioxygenases. [...] They {{commonly}} catalyze {{the attachment}} of molecular oxygen [...] as a peroxy residue to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) {{that contain two}} carbon-carbon double bonds that for the human ALOX15 are located between carbons 10 and 9 and 7 and 6 as numbered counting backward from the last or omega (i.e. ω) carbon at the methyl end of the PUFA (these carbons are also termed ω-10 and ω-9 and ω-7 and ω-6). [...] In PUFAs {{that do not have}} a third carbon-carbon double bound between their ω-13 and ω-12 carbons, human ALOX15 forms ω-6 peroxy intermediates; in PUFAs that do have this third double bound, human ALOX15 makes the ω-6 peroxy intermediate but also small amounts of the ω-9 peroxy intermediate. Rodent Alox15 enzymes, in contrast, produce almost exclusively ω-9 peroxy intermediates. Concurrently, ALOX15 and rodent Alox15 enzymes rearrange the carbon-carbon double bonds to bring them into the 1S-hydroxy-2E,4Z-diene configuration. ALOX15 and Alox15 enzymes act {{with a high degree of}} Stereospecificity to form products that position the hydroperoxy residue in the S <b>stereoisomer</b> configuration.|$|E
2500|$|... 9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (9-hydroxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid or 9-HODE) {{has been}} used in the {{literature}} to designate either or both of two <b>stereoisomer</b> metabolites of the essential fatty acid, linoleic acid: 9(S)-hydroxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (9(S)-HODE) and 9(R)-hydroxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid (9(R)-HODE); these two metabolites differ in having their hydroxy residues in the S or R configurations, respectively. [...] The accompanying figure gives the structure for 9(S)-HETE. [...] Two other 9-hydroxy linoleic acid derivatives occur in nature, the 10E,12E isomers of 9(S)-HODE and 9(R)-HODE viz., 9(S)-hydroxy-10E,12E-octadecadienoic acid (9(S)-EE-HODE) and 9(R)-hydroxy-10E,12E-octadecadienoic acid (13(R)-EE-HODE); these two derivatives have their double bond at carbon 12 in the E or trans configuration as opposed to the Z or cis configuration. [...] The four 9-HODE isomers, particularly under conditions of oxidative stress, may form together in cells and tissues; they have overlapping but not identical biological activities and significances. [...] Because many studies have not distinguished between the S and R stereoisomers and, particularly in identifying tissue levels, the two EE isomers, 9-HODE is used here when the isomer studied is unclear.|$|E
2500|$|The {{metabolism}} of {{the tobacco}} smoke procarcinogen benzopyrene involves three distinct steps [...] the introduction of an epoxide group in the 7,8-position, its hydration to a vicinal diol {{and the introduction of}} an epoxide in the 9,10-position. [...] In the first step, a cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) catalysed oxidation produces several products including (+)-benzopyrene-7,8-epoxide. [...] The enzyme epoxide hydrolase, then hydrates the epoxide ring to yield the vicinal diol (...) -benzopyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol, which is then oxidised by cytochrome P450 oxidase again forming the mutagen and carcinogen (+)-benzopyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide. [...] This diol epoxide covalently binds to DNA by a ring-opening to alkylate the nucleobase forming a distorted structure, as shown at right, with intercalation of a pyrene polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon moiety between the base pairs favouring π-stacking; these distortions have been confirmed by X-ray crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance structure studies. [...] Aflatoxin has a similar mechanism of action, though its binding is through the N7, rather than the N2, position of guanine. [...] Multiple stereochemical outcomes are possible from these transformations. [...] The anti <b>stereoisomer</b> (shown here) and its enantiomer are the ultimate carcinogens from benzopyrene, but the syn isomers are also produced.|$|E
