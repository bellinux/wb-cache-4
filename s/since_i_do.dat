500|$|Despite {{his initial}} reaction, Monteux worked with Stravinsky, giving {{practical}} advice {{to help the}} composer to achieve the orchestral balance and effects he sought. Together they worked on the score from March to May 1913, {{and to get the}} orchestra of the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées to cope with the unfamiliar and difficult music Monteux held seventeen rehearsals, an unusually large number. Monteux's real attitude to the score is unclear. In his old age he told a biographer, [...] "I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times <b>since.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not like it now." [...] However, he told his wife in 1963 that the Rite was [...] "now fifty years old, and I do not think it has aged at all. I had pleasure in conducting the fiftieth anniversary of Le Sacre this spring".|$|E
500|$|Poulenc {{said that}} he was not inventive in his {{harmonic}} language. The composer Lennox Berkeley wrote of him, [...] "All through his life, he was content to use conventional harmony, but his use of it was so individual, so immediately recognizable as his own, that it gave his music freshness and validity." [...] Keck considers Poulenc's harmonic language [...] "as beautiful, interesting and personal as his melodic writing... clear, simple harmonies moving in obviously defined tonal areas with chromaticism that is rarely more than passing". Poulenc had no time for musical theories; in one of his many radio interviews he called for [...] "a truce to composing by theory, doctrine, rule!" [...] He was dismissive of what he saw as the dogmatism of latter-day adherents to dodecaphony, led by René Leibowitz, and greatly regretted that the adoption of a theoretical approach had affected the music of Olivier Messiaen, of whom he had earlier had high hopes. To Hell, almost all Poulenc's music is [...] "directly or indirectly inspired by the purely melodic associations of the human voice". Poulenc was a painstaking craftsman, though a myth grew up– [...] "la légende de facilité"– that his music came easily to him; he commented, [...] "The myth is excusable, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> everything to conceal my efforts." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several years <b>since</b> (<b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{recollect}} {{the precise}} date) a player, named White, of Ryegate (sic), brought a bat to a match, which being {{the width of}} the stumps, effectually defended his wicket from the bowler : and, in consequence, a law was passed limiting the future width of the bat to 4¼ inches. [...] Another law was decreed that the ball should not weigh less than 5½ oz, or more than 5¾ oz.|$|E

"Yes," [...] said Ralph, also {{speaking}} in an undertone, [...] "she was up very early this morning, {{and has been}} at some sort of work ever <b>since.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not intend that this shall happen again.

"As {{an adviser}} I am rather {{qualified}} {{to point out}} what should be avoided than what may be pursued, for my own life has been {{but a series of}} imprudences and conflicts of all descriptions.

6000|$|... "The young lady," [...] he continued, [...] "seemed, on the {{occasion}} to which you have referred, to be particularly anxious to avoid recognition.

6000|$|... "'Tell my father, King Huaracha, that I have {{fulfilled}} his oath, {{but that}} I cannot marry Urco.

But the blessing of Heaven, ah! that can be bought, as I have proved once and again, if not with gold, then otherwise. Did I not in bygone years pass the first son of my manhood through the fire to Baal-Sidon? Nay, shrink not from me; it cost me dear, but my fortune was at stake, and better that the boy should die than that all of us should live on in penury and bonds. Know you not, Prince, that the gods must have the gifts of the best, gifts of blood and virtue, or they will curse us and torment us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I," [...] said Gurth, [...] "could {{take it on}} my halidome, that I {{have heard}} {{the voice of the}} good yeoman who won it, by night as well as by day, and that the moon is not three days older <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> so." ...|$|R

60|$|He had me. I wasn't {{stopping}} at any hotel, and, <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not know the}} name of a hotel in the place, I could not claim residence in any of them. Also, I was up too early in the morning. Everything was against me.|$|R
6000|$|... "To abandon my false gods. Lead me back {{to peace}} by the steps you've trod. By so much as they must have {{remained}} traceable to you, shall I find them of interest and profit. They must in fact be most remarkable: won't they even--for what I may find in them--be more remarkable than those we should now be taking together if we hadn't separated, if we hadn't pulled up?" [...] That was a proposition I could present to her with candour, but before her absence of precipitation had permitted her much to consider it I had already followed it on. [...] "You'll just tell me, however, that <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> pull up and turn back with you we shall just have not separated. Well, then, so much the better--I see you're right. But I want," [...] I earnestly declared, [...] "not to lose an inch of the journey." ...|$|E
60|$|Many {{thanks for}} the review: your article is excellent. I only wish that you had said more of the deserts of {{government}} in respect to Ireland; <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> sincerely believe that no government in Europe has shown better dispositions to its subjects than the English have done to the Irish, and that no country has improved so much during the same period. You have adverted {{to this part of}} the subject, but not spoken so forcibly as I could have wished. There is another point might be insisted upon more expressly than you have done--the danger, not to say the absurdity, of Roman Catholic legislation for the property of a Protestant church, so inadequately represented in Parliament as ours is. The Convocation is gone; clergymen are excluded from the House of Commons; and the Bishops are at the beck of Ministers. I boldly ask what real property of the country is so inadequately represented: it is a mere mockery.|$|E
6000|$|... "And indeed {{upon the}} air came {{the sound of}} a great, horrible, yelling roar unspeakably dreadful. It seems never to have been out of my ears <b>since.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know whether an American mob would have {{proceeded}} to extremities with a lonely woman and dying child, but there was an Irish and Spanish element of ferocity at Burkeville, and the cold, hard Englishwoman was unpopular, besides that, I was supposed to share in the irregular practice that had had such fatal effects. But with that horrible sound, one did not stop to weigh probabilities. I gathered up my child in her bed-clothes, and followed the boy out at the back door, blindly. And where do you think I found myself? where but in the minister's house? His wife, whose daughter had just been carried out to her grave, rose up from weeping and praying, to take me into the innermost chamber, where none could see me, and when she saw my darling's state, to give me all the help and sympathy a good woman could. Oh! that was my first true knowledge of Christian charity.|$|E
