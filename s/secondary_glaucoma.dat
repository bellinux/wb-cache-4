5|$|Eye {{conditions}} which affect the Parson Russell Terrier include primary lens luxation, a heritable condition. This disease causes the zonular fibres to be abnormal {{and begin to}} disintegrate in affected dogs. The fibres support {{the lens of the}} eye, and their destruction can cause the lens to fall into the wrong location within the eye. If the lens falls into the anterior chamber of eyeball then a <b>secondary</b> <b>glaucoma</b> can occur, causing loss of vision. National kennel associations such as the Kennel Club (UK) publish DNA screening results on Parson Russell Terriers, broken down into three groups; clears, carriers, and affecteds.|$|E
25|$|If not treated, the retinal {{detachment}} {{can lead}} to ischemia and growth of new blood vessels over the iris and anterior chamber angle. This in turn can cause <b>secondary</b> <b>glaucoma,</b> cataract and, ultimately, blindness of the eye.|$|E
25|$|<b>Secondary</b> <b>glaucoma</b> {{refers to}} any {{case in which}} another disease, trauma, drug or {{procedure}} causes increased eye pressure, resulting in optic nerve damage and vision loss, and may be mild or severe. It can be due to an eye injury, inflammation, a tumor, or advanced cases of cataracts or diabetes. It can also be caused by certain drugs such as steroids.

40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} {{clinical}} profile {{and distribution of}} various subtypes of glaucoma in a referral practice in North India. Method: A retrospective analysis was done of 2425 patients who attended the glaucoma clinic in a tertiary eye-care centre for five years from Januaryl 995 to December 1999. A detailed history was obtained and a thorough examination was performed, including gonioscopy, disc assessment, applanation tonometry and automated perimetry. Diurnal variation of IOP and provocative tests for glaucoma were done where applicable. Result: Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) {{was the most common}} glaucoma subtype. The primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) to the PACG ratio was 37 : 63. Chronic angle closure glaucoma (CACG) was the most common PACG subtype. The majority of CACG cases were relatively asymptomatic. Male dominance was seen for POAG, juvenile open angle glaucoma (JOAG), CACG, normal tension <b>glaucoma</b> (NTG) and <b>secondary</b> <b>glaucomas.</b> Female dominance was seen for ocular hypertension (OHT), acute or intermittent ACG and developmental glaucomas. The mean age in years at presentation was POAG: 60. 54 years (males 61. 54 years, females 59. 01 years) and PACG: 55. 13 years (males 57. 25 years, females 53. 60). The three common <b>secondary</b> <b>glaucomas</b> were: <b>glaucoma</b> <b>secondary</b> to adherent leucoma, aphakic and pseudophakic glaucomas and traumatic glaucomas. Advanced glaucoma was detected in 42 to 53 &#x 0025; of patients and bilateral blindness in 8 to 14 &#x 0025; of patients in various subtypes. Conclusion: Compared to Caucasians, glaucoma patients in North India seem to present nearly a decade earlier and the disease is more advanced at presentation. While PACG is the most commonly encountered glaucoma, NTG and exfoliative glaucoma are relatively rare...|$|R

40|$|Diabetes {{morbidity}} grows steadily despite recent {{progress in}} its diagnostics and treatment.

Aim To analyse late results of ophthalmosurgery in diabetic patients with vision problems. Materials and methods Over 24, 000 patients were examined from January 2006 to November 2010 at the Department of Diabetic Retinopathy and Ophthalmosurgery, Endocrinological Research Centre. Results of more than 2660 seances of retinal laser coagulation and about 350 surgical interventions for diabetic cataract and <b>secondary</b> neovascular <b>glaucoma</b> were available for analysis.

40|$|Trabeculectomy is a {{commonly}} performed procedure for primary open angle glaucoma and is {{successful in the}} majority of cases.

The mechanism (or mechanisms) which influence clinical outcome following trabeculectomy remain elusive. Alterations in the composition of the conjunctiva or aqueous humour may be partly responsible for this effect, and this could be mediated by cytokines. In this study we found that tumour necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin 1 (IL- 1) were capable of stimulating the proliferation of Tenon's capsule fibroblasts in tissue culture. Interleukin 6 (IL- 6) did not appear to have any effect. The relevance of this to wound healing following trabeculectomy is discussed...|$|R

40|$|A {{method of}} cyclocryocautery, using the Kelman Cryostylet, is described. On rabbit eyes this brings about a {{statistically}} significant lowering of intraocular pressure and reduction of aqueous flow over an observation period of three months. The effects upon the facility of outflow are variable. Side effects are minimal. The intraocular temperature was measured at various points during and after cryocautery. An applicator temperature of about - 40 ° C was found sufficient for the desired result with minimal side effects. Angiocryocautery of one or both long posterior ciliary vessels resulted only in a temporary reduction of intraocular pressure, as permanent obliteration of these vessels was not possible by this method.

40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} case of {{bilateral}} acute angle-closure glaucoma after oral administration of cabergoline {{for the treatment of}} galactorrhea. Methods: A diagnosis of <b>secondary</b> drug-induced angle-closure <b>glaucoma</b> was made in a patient with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and myopic refractive shift, which was confirmed by ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) of the ciliary body and anterior segment, sonography, and optical coherence tomography. The treatment included the discontinuation of the culprit drug and the administration of topical anti-glaucoma drops. The treatment course was followed with serial measurements of the IOP and refraction, and with performing UBM. Results: Five hours after he received a single 0. 5 -mg oral cabergoline tablet, the patient suffered from acute <b>secondary</b> angle-closure <b>glaucoma</b> and myopic refractive error. UBM demonstrated both effusion of the ciliary body and an anterior rotation of the iris-ciliary body.

50|$|Lens {{subluxation}} is {{also seen}} in dogs and {{is characterized by}} a partial displacement of the lens. It can be recognized by trembling of the iris (iridodonesis) or lens (phacodonesis) and the presence of an aphakic crescent (an area of the pupil where the lens is absent). Other signs of lens subluxation include mild conjunctival redness, vitreous humour degeneration, prolapse of the vitreous into the anterior chamber, and an increase or decrease of anterior chamber depth. Removal of the lens before it completely luxates into the anterior chamber may prevent <b>secondary</b> <b>glaucoma.</b> A nonsurgical alternative involves the use of a miotic to constrict the pupil and prevent the lens from luxating into the anterior chamber.|$|E
50|$|With {{anterior}} lens luxation, {{the lens}} pushes into the iris or actually enters the anterior {{chamber of the}} eye. This can cause glaucoma, uveitis, or damage to the cornea. Uveitis (inflammation of the eye) causes the pupil to constrict (miosis) and trap the lens in the anterior chamber, leading to an obstruction of outflow of aqueous humour and subsequent increase in ocular pressure (glaucoma). Better prognosis is valued in lens replacement surgery (retained vision and normal intraocular pressure) when it is performed {{before the onset of}} <b>secondary</b> <b>glaucoma.</b> Glaucoma secondary to anterior lens luxation is less common in cats than dogs due to their naturally deeper anterior chamber and the liquification of the vitreous humour secondary to chronic inflammation. Anterior lens luxation is considered to be an ophthalmological emergency.|$|E
