Standard clarifier design has the effluent entering {{at the bottom of the}} inclined plates, colliding with the sludge sliding down the plates.

A potential difference is applied between both channels of <b>flowing</b> carbon <b>slurries,</b> the so-called <b>flow</b> electrodes, and water is desalinated. Since the carbon <b>slurries</b> <b>flow,</b> the electrodes do not saturate and therefore this cell design can be used for the desalination of water with high salt concentrations as well (e.g. sea water, with salt concentrations of approximately 30 g/L). A discharging step is not necessary; the carbon slurries are, after leaving the cell, mixed together and the carbon slurry can be separated from a concentrated salt water stream.|$|R

At Argonne {{during this period}} of time, she was engaged primarily in applied work. This involved applications of physics in engineering and in specific areas such as radiation safety. In particular, her work included engineering research relative to fossil energy utilization, as well as radioactive waste disposal, technology for arms control verification, and radiological emergency preparedness and also chemical warfare agent emergency preparedness.Initially, in 1977, Herzenberg joined a project for developing instrumentation for process control {{for a new generation of}} coal conversion and combustion plants. Development proceeded on non-invasive techniques for measuring the composition and flow rate of coal slurries and pulverized coal in pneumatic transport in pipes. For the analysis of the composition of coal, she worked on the application of neutron-induced gamma spectrometry; while measurement of <b>slurry</b> <b>flow</b> was based on using short lived radioactivity induced in the slurry. She later worked in technology assessment and evaluation of programs in areas that included fossil energy utilization, arms control verification, and radioactive waste disposal. She also worked in emergency preparedness and response for technological hazards, mainly in radiological emergency preparedness for nuclear power plants and emergency preparedness for chemical demilitarization.|$|E
50|$|New collieries, {{particularly}} {{in the western part}} of the coalfield where anthracite is found, were developed into the 1960s by the National Coal Board (for instance, Cynheidre Colliery No 1 shaft, at 798 yd deep was sunk in 1954/6). Following the general collapse of the UK coal industry, most pits closed during the 1980s, with factors such as exhaustion of reserves and geological complexity adding to their problems. The last deep mine, at Tower Colliery on the north crop, ceased mining in January 2008. However, a few small licensed mines continue to work seams, mostly from outcrop, on the hillsides. Although some areas of the coalfield are effectively worked out, considerable reserves remain. However, the geological difficulties, which resulted in the closure of (for instance) Nantgarw colliery, make the cost of significant further extraction high. The coalfield experienced a late-stage development when opencast mining was commenced on a large scale, mostly on the gently-dipping north crop. In addition, old tips were reclaimed for their small coal content, which could be burned in power stations such as nearby Aberthaw. Most of the old sites have been filled and landscaped, but new operations continue.Following the Aberfan disaster of 1966, when a coal-tip <b>slurry</b> <b>flow</b> buried a school, mine-waste tips, which had been piled precariously on hilltops in many cases, were extensively regraded and reclaimed. This work continues. Landslipping of the steep valley slopes, and subsidence caused by the coal extraction, have also posed problems.|$|E

5000|$|One of the {{problems}} encountered with the Mark I Cell was that its performance was reduced if the feed rate to the cell varied, which was a common occurrence arising from normal fluctuations in operating concentrators. This problem was resolved by recycling some of the tailings to the cell feed via an external splitter box called an [...] "External Recycle Mechanism" [...] or [...] "ERM" [...] box separate to the flotation cell. Thus, when {{the production of the}} feed stream to the Jameson Cell decreased {{as a result of a}} fluctuation elsewhere in the concentrator, a higher percentage of the tailings was automatically recycled to the downcomers, producing a constant flow rate, hence feed pressure, to the cell. This had the added benefit of giving a proportion of the tailings (typically 40%) a second pass through the system, which resulted in higher recoveries. In coal fines flotation, this allowed a single Cell to achieve the same recovery of combustibles as had previously been achieved in some two-stage Cell systems. [...] Subsequently, an internal recycling system, referred to as the [...] "internal recycle control" [...] or [...] "IRC" [...] was developed. This was mainly used in integrated rectangular cells (see Figure 6), where the feed tank and tailings recycling system could easily be built in a single unit with the flotation cell. This system reduced the cell installation costs and made the cell more compact. During this period, the orifice diameter was increased from the 28 mm design used in 1990 to 34 mm with the Mark II model and 38 mm in 1997.

40|$|Copper {{polishing}} performance depends significantly on {{the properties}} of pads, slurries, conditioning, pressure, sliding velocity, <b>slurry</b> <b>flow</b> rate and temperature. A slight variance {{in each of these}} parameters will cause significant change in polising results. Various investigations are performed during this study to understand the effect of consumables and other main operating parameters on copper polishing in terms of removal rate, lubrication mechanism, and temperature transients. A modified two-step Langmuir-Hinshelwood removal rate model and a flash heating thermal model are developed to describe the removal mechanism. Results indicate that grain size plays an important role during copper polishing. Smaller grain size may enhance the chemical rate by providing a higher density of favorable reaction sites. However, denser grain boundaries due to smaller grain size may reduce the mechanical rate by increasing the probability of disruption of three body sliding contact. It is found that removal rate increases as <b>slurry</b> <b>flow</b> increases from 60 to 80 cc/min because higher <b>slurry</b> <b>flow</b> rate can provide more reactants to the system. Then removal rate decreases as <b>slurry</b> <b>flow</b> rate is further increased to 140 cc/min, which is due to synergic effects of the wafer temperature, <b>slurry</b> <b>flow</b> and slurry residence time under the wafer. The observed removal rate drop is thought to be due to the change of the wafer temperature at high sliding velocity. Experimental results from eight slurry formulations with various abrasize size and content show {{that in the case of}} 13 -nm abrasives, the dominant tribological mechanism is that of partial lubrication, while in the case of 35 -nm abrasives, the dominant tribological mechanism is that of boundary lubrication. COF values of the slurry with surfactant are generally lower that those of the slurry without surfactant. Logarithmic spiral positive pad, whose spiral groove is at a slight angle to the pad rotation direction, shows the highest average COF. The radial pad results in the smallest average COF. For all types of the grooved pads investigated, CMP is mechanically limited at low pV, and chemically limited at high pV. Non-Prestonian behavior is thought to be due to variations of COF and substrate temperatures. Dual Emission UV Light Enhanced Fluorescence results indicate that during polishing the wafer is tilted towards the center of the pad and that the extent of wafer tilt is a strong function of diamond disc pressure. Increasing the oscillation frequency of the diamond disc or the rotation rate decreases slurry film thickness. Slurry film thickness increases with the <b>slurry</b> <b>flow</b> rate. Also slurry film thickness strongly depends on diamond disc design...|$|E
