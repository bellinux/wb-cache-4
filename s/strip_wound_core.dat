The stator cores of the prototype axial field permanent magnet disk motor (PMDM), which is under consideration, are made of <b>wound</b> <b>strip</b> <b>cores.</b> Two types of PMDM stators are analyzed: laminated and SMC material stators. The comparison analysis {{is based on the}} production complexity and the magnetic properties and calculated parameters. The magnetic parameters under consideration are the flux densities in various sections of the magnetic circuit and the iron losses in these sections. The values for both types of stators are calculated using finite-element-method (FEM) analysis. The production complexity and the values of the magnetic parameters are in favor of the SMC material stators in relation to the laminated stators...|$|R

40|$|The present thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} numerical techniques and methods for the evaluation and minimization of <b>wound</b> <b>core</b> distribution transformer no load losses. The aforementioned numerical techniques are combined with deterministic and stochastic optimization algorithms for the minimization of the manufacturing and the total owing cost of <b>wound</b> <b>core</b> transformers. The no load loss evaluation is achieved by {{the application of a}} new technique that combines the computed peak flux density distribution with the experimentally determined local specific core losses. The computation of the peak flux density distribution is performed by a novel iterative procedure and nonlinear finite element magnetostatic analysis, avoiding in this manner the computationally expensive harmonic and transient analysis. The representation of the <b>wound</b> <b>core</b> material anisotropy is accomplished by a new elliptic anisotropy model specifically developed for <b>wound</b> <b>cores,</b> in contrast with conventional elliptic anisotropy models that have been developed so far which are suitable for stack core transformers. The advantages of the aforementioned technique, in contrast with conventional techniques appearing in the literature, are its accuracy and low computational cost which renders the proposed numerical technique ideal for industry application. Furthermore, a novel technique for the no load loss minimization has been developed. The specific technique is based on the <b>wound</b> <b>core</b> flux density non-uniformity and makes use of multiple grade lamination <b>wound</b> <b>cores</b> which are constructed of two different grades of grain oriented magnetic steel. By applying the multiple grade lamination <b>wound</b> <b>core</b> technique a further reduction of the total owing cost of <b>wound</b> <b>core</b> distribution transformers is achieved. The numerical techniques developed in the present thesis are going to contribute to the reduction of the manufacturing cost and no load loss of <b>wound</b> <b>core</b> transformers. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{three-phase}} five legged <b>wound</b> transformer <b>core</b> constructed of two high permeability Si-Fe <b>wound</b> <b>cores</b> and two conventional Si-Fe <b>wound</b> <b>cores.</b> The two large internal <b>wound</b> <b>cores</b> are manufactured of high permeability, grain-oriented electrical steel. The two small outer <b>wound</b> <b>cores</b> are manufactured of conventional, grain-oriented electrical steel. The specific arrangement {{is based on}} experimental evidence concerning the peak flux density non-uniformity of the typical three-phase five legged <b>wound</b> transformer <b>core,</b> constructed of the high magnetization grain-oriented steel. Since the peak flux density of the two outer cores {{is lower than the}} two internal cores, low cost, low permeability, conventional grain-oriented electrical steel can be used for the outer cores.

40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to present}} an {{accurate}} representation of laminated <b>wound</b> <b>cores</b> with a low computational cost using 2 D and 3 D finite element (FE) method. Design/methodology/approach - The authors developed an anisotropy model in order to model laminated <b>wound</b> <b>cores.</b> The anisotropy model was integrated to the 2 D and 3 D FE method. A comparison between 2 D and 3 D FE techniques was carried out. FE techniques were validated by experimental analysis. Findings - In the case of no-load operation of <b>wound</b> <b>core</b> transformers both 2 D and 3 D FE techniques yield the same results. Computed and experimental local flux density distribution and no-load loss agree within 2 per cent to 6 per cent. Originality/value - The originality of the paper consists {{in the development of}} an anisotropy model specifically formulated for laminated <b>wound</b> <b>cores,</b> and in the effective representation of electrical steels using a composite single-valued function. By using the aforementioned techniques, the FE computational cost is minimised and the 3 D FE analysis of <b>wound</b> <b>cores</b> is rendered practical. © 2012 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.
