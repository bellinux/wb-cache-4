Carpeting and full wheel covers rounded out Bel Air standard equipment. For 1954, the Bel Air stayed essentially the same, except for a revised grille and taillights, and a revised engine that had insert bearings and higher oil pressure, needed for the full-flow oil filtration system that was not available prior to 1954. [...] Prior to 1954, the 235 and 216 cubic inch six cylinder engines had babbit bearings and scoops to create oil pressure at the bottom of each rod and the oil pressure was standard at 15-30 PSI. During these years, there were three engine choices, depending on the transmission ordered. Both 235 cubic inch engines were [...] "Blue Flame" [...] inline six cylinder OHV engines, featuring hydraulic valve lifters (in 1953 with automatic transmissions) and aluminum pistons. The [...] 235 cubic inch displacement engine was standard on <b>stickshift</b> models, with solid lifters and splash plus pressure lubrication including babbit bearings. Powerglide cars got a [...] version which had hydraulic lifters and full pressure lubrication.|$|E

50|$|Along with a {{standard}} column-mounted three speed Synchro-Mesh transmission, the buyer of a '55 Chevy could specify an optional Overdrive unit {{to go with the}} <b>stickshift,</b> or the fully automatic two-speed Powerglide transmission. Although most everything was new in 1955 for Chevrolet, the reliable Powerglide was mostly unchanged from '54.|$|E
5000|$|For the Dauphine, a Ferlec {{semi-automatic}} {{was offered}} from 1957 until 1963, when the [...] "fully automatic" [...] Jaeger electromechanical transmission control became available. The Ferlec transmission was a manual-selection transmission coupled to dry clutch that engaged and disengaged by touching the gearshift, similar to driver operation of Volkswagen's Automatic <b>Stickshift,</b> {{but without the}} torque converter of the VW.|$|E
50|$|In 1976, the 1303/La Grande Bug was discontinued, {{with the}} larger body {{continuing}} only in convertible form. To {{make up for the}} loss in North American markets, the standard Beetle was upgraded, regaining some of the features that were removed in 1971. In addition, the 2-speed ventilation fan was included, previously available in North America only on the larger Beetle. The automatic <b>stickshift</b> option was discontinued as well.|$|E
50|$|Throughout its history, BBEdit has {{supported}} many Apple technologies {{that failed to}} gain traction, including OpenDoc and PowerTalk. The failure of PowerTalk, and the desire of developers to have email integrated to their text editor, {{led to the development}} of Mailsmith, an email client that uses BBEdit's editor component. Formerly developed by Bare Bones as a commercial application, in 2009 Mailsmith was transferred to <b>Stickshift</b> Software LLC and would continue to be developed as a labor of love and released as freeware.|$|E

During {{a dinner}} at the Court household, where Lloyd fails to impress Diane's family, Jim is informed that he is {{under investigation by the}} Internal Revenue Service. Diane takes Lloyd to meet the residents of the retirement home and he teaches her to drive her <b>stickshift</b> car. Their relationship grows intimate and they have sex, to her father's concern. Lloyd's musician friend Corey, who has never gotten over her cheating ex-boyfriend, Joe, warns him to take care of Diane.|$|E
50|$|Marketed as the Volkswagen Automatic <b>Stickshift,</b> {{the three}} speed manual {{transmission}} {{was connected to}} a vacuum-operated automatic clutch. The top of the gear shift was designed to easily depress and activate an electric switch, i.e. when engaged by the drivers hand. When pressed, the switch operated a 12 volt solenoid in turn operating the vacuum clutch, thus disengaging the clutch and allowing shifting between gears. With the driver's hand removed from the gearshift, the clutch would re-engage automatically. The transmission was also equipped with a torque converter, allowing the car to idle in gear, like an automatic. The torque converter was operated by transmission fluid. This would allow the car to stop in any gear and start from a standing stop in any gear.|$|E

5000|$|For the 1968 model year, the Volkswagen Beetle {{offered an}} {{optional}} transmission marketed as Automatic <b>Stickshift</b> which {{was essentially a}} three-speed manual without a clutch pedal. Application of the driver's hand to gearshift knob caused the clutch to disengage via a 12 volt solenoid operating the vacuum clutch, thereby allowing shifting between gears. Once the driver's hand was removed, the clutch would re-engage automatically. The transmission was also equipped with a torque converter, allowing the car to idle in gear, like an automatic. The torque converter was operated by transmission fluid. This would allow the car to stop in any gear and start from a standing stop in any gear. This transmission was first available on the 1967 Volkswagen Beetle, and was made available on the Karmann Ghia in 1967. VW dropped the transmission option altogether in 1976. Some older (early 1960s) VW's sold in Europe had a [...] "Saxomat" [...] system which used a centrifigal clutch coupled to a standard 4-speed transmission.|$|E
