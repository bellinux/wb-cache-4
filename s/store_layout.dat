Three store employees, Morio Oshima, 39, Mai Koishi, 20, and Maiko Sekiguchi, 19, died in the first arson incident. In 2007, Noriko Watanabe, 49, {{was found guilty of}} setting the fires and sentenced to life imprisonment. Don Quijote received harsh criticism at the time for poor <b>store</b> <b>layout</b> that made it difficult to find exits.|$|E
2500|$|Blockbuster was {{the largest}} video rental chain in the country, but {{finances}} were not good enough due to high rental prices. Lojas Americanas, the largest Brazilian department store, acquired half of the shares {{and now it is}} named under [...] "Americanas Express Blockbuster". The <b>store</b> <b>layout</b> was similar to a regular American store with a Game Rush, but instead of games it offers electronics goods like computers and DVD players, groceries like candies and microwave popcorn, and even toys from Mattel and Hasbro's board games. Blockbuster sold its Brazilian stake in 2007 for a steep loss.|$|E
2500|$|Ron Johnson {{held the}} {{position}} of Senior Vice President of Retail Operations from 2001 until November 1, 2011. During his tenure, {{it was reported that}} while Johnson was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and <b>store</b> <b>layout,</b> inventory was controlled by then-COO and now-CEO Tim Cook, who has a background in supply chain management. In January 2012, Apple transferred retail leadership to John Browett. However, after attempts to cut costs, including reducing new hires and limiting staff hours, he was fired after six months, later telling a conference that he [...] "just didn’t fit with the way they ran the business". In October 2013, Apple hired Angela Ahrendts from Burberry.|$|E
40|$|<b>Store</b> <b>layouts</b> are {{important}} determinants of behaviour. A {{review of the}} academic and commercial literature suggests that the methodological and theoretical approaches have provided methods and approaches that are difficult for practitioners to adopt. This paper offers a robust theoretical approach (the behavioural perspective model) and new innovative methodology that significantly advances the way retailers can plan and measure <b>store</b> <b>layouts,</b> {{with a view to}} optimising store performance. Using computer-aided observation, customers may be tracked and their behaviour analysed in the context of consumer situations and contingencies. Implications for retail management, theory and practice are discussed within the context of fashion shopper situations...|$|R
50|$|Marshalls and T.J. Maxx {{operate as}} sister stores, and share a similar {{footprint}} throughout the country. While the two operate at near-identical price points and have similar <b>store</b> <b>layouts,</b> Marshalls differentiates itself by featuring a larger emphasis on family footwear and larger men's and juniors departments.|$|R
50|$|Retailing: {{retail stores}} have {{strategically}} placed products or advertisements in key positions with the <b>stores</b> <b>layout</b> {{being a very}} vital touchpoint. Managing the <b>layout</b> of the <b>store</b> can be a vital point in whether or not items are sold or a service is purchased (Jain, Bagdare, 2009).|$|R
2500|$|SavaCentre was a {{chain of}} 13 hypermarkets and 7 {{discount}} supermarkets operated between 1977 and 2005, initially in {{a joint venture with}} BHS. The stores ranged in size between [...] and , and the discount supermarkets between [...] and [...] At the time of its inception it was the only dedicated hypermarket chain in the UK. <b>Store</b> <b>layout</b> consisted of a 50:50 split between food and non-food shopping, with a complete range of both retailers' products, and later included input from Habitat and Mothercare as they merged with BHS. Some stores also included features such as a petrol station and in-store cafe. In 1989 Sainsbury's bought out BHS's half stake, but still allowed BHS to retail from SavaCentres until they offered its own clothing and merchandise offering.|$|E
2500|$|At Apple, {{employees}} are specialists {{who are not}} exposed to functions outside their area of expertise. Jobs saw this {{as a means of}} having [...] "best-in-class" [...] employees in every role. For instance, Ron Johnson—Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011—was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and <b>store</b> <b>layout,</b> yet had no control of the inventory in his stores (this was done by Cook, who had a background in supply-chain management). Apple is also known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a [...] "directly responsible individual," [...] or [...] "DRI" [...] in Apple jargon. As an example, when iOS senior vice president Scott Forstall refused to sign Apple's official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned Maps app, he was forced to resign. Unlike other major U.S. companies Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft. The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, BI-LO {{invested}} in redesigning its <b>store</b> <b>layout</b> to attract high end customers. The {{result was the}} new Super BI-LO concept of a larger <b>store</b> <b>layout</b> featuring a greater selection of healthier foods, specialty foods and organic foods. Since then the company has opened new Super BI-LO branded stores as well as remodeled older stores in affluent neighborhoods.|$|E

However the Nerd Herd desk remains in roughly the same location. The Home Theater room appears for the first time.|$|R
50|$|T.J. Maxx and Marshalls {{operate as}} sister stores, and share a similar {{footprint}} throughout the country. While their prices are nearly identical {{and they have}} similar <b>store</b> <b>layouts,</b> T.J. Maxx has a more upscale appearance than Marshalls and typically sells a larger range of fine jewelry and accessories. Some higher-volume stores have a high-end designer department called The Runway.|$|R
50|$|While <b>store</b> <b>layout</b> {{is based}} upon {{available}} space, the typical Famous Footwear store averages about 7000 sq ft in size and includes about 60 percent of centrally purchased universal products and 40 percent customized {{to the needs and}} tendencies of the specific store. Exterior decor tends to be austere and internal <b>store</b> <b>layout</b> simple to facilitate casual navigation.|$|E

5000|$|As {{a result}} of the {{cooperative}} system, there has been no set format for building architecture, <b>store</b> <b>layout,</b> or color scheme of the storefronts. Most stores are the product of the era in which they were opened, and the owner's style. For example, the ShopRite of West Caldwell, New Jersey has a Japanese motif inside and outside of the store (including rickshaws, an exit sign reading [...] "Sayonara" [...] and two Japanese-style phone booths). The Ronetco family of stores (Netcong, Byram, Newton, Franklin, Flanders, Mansfield, and Succasunna, New Jersey) have different looks on the outside (including the shopping carts and cart corrals), although the stores themselves have a similar layout. ShopRite stores that were previously other stores usually contain elements of the previous occupant. As large corporations buy up stores, recent years have brought a homogenization in building design and <b>store</b> <b>layout.</b>|$|E
50|$|In March 2016, M&M Meat Shops {{announced}} that they would change their name to M&M Food Market. With the name change came a broadening of M&M's selection beyond frozen meats to include sushi, fish tacos, frozen produce, and other healthier selections. The company also indicated plans to expand M&M to 500 locations by 2019, along with revamped <b>store</b> <b>layouts</b> that remove the service counter that separates customers from the freezers.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, {{the company}} closed its catalog {{business}} after 113 years and began an aggressive policy of renovating its remaining stores. It restructured {{many of the}} <b>store</b> <b>layouts</b> in the downtown areas of larger cities and affluent neighborhoods into boutique-like specialty stores, as these were drawing business from traditional department stores. In 1988, the company management undertook a successful $3.8 billion leveraged buyout, making Montgomery Ward a privately held company.|$|R
2500|$|In 2013 Kmart began a {{roll-out}} of new <b>store</b> <b>layouts.</b> Garden plant {{sections were}} removed, {{and back of}} store areas were cut back.

The stores were given a more [...] "Department Store" [...] feel with front of shop checkouts replaced with an area for non-self serve customers to pay at in the centre of the store.|$|R
50|$|Incremental lists {{typically}} have no structure and new items {{are added to}} the bottom of the list as they come up. If the list is compiled immediately before use, it can be organized by <b>store</b> <b>layout</b> (e.g. frozen foods are grouped together on the list) to minimize time in the store. Preprinted lists can be similarly organized.|$|E
50|$|Another {{feature of}} Capitalism is the layout plan library, which can <b>store</b> <b>layout</b> plans {{for all types}} of {{buildings}} available in the game. It enables the player to save previously used layout plans into a library as a record and then apply them to buildings to save time rather than creating new layout plans. Layout plans can be replaced, added, deleted or sorted.|$|E
50|$|The {{chain is}} {{considered}} by some industry analysts as being a no frills brand of store.

5000|$|Planograms, {{also known}} as plano-grams, plan-o-grams, {{schematics}} and POGs, are visual representations of a store's products or services. They are considered a tool for visual merchandising. According to the Oxford Dictionary, [...] "It is a diagram or model that indicates the placement of retail products on shelves {{in order to maximize}} sales." [...] Planograms therefore help dictate a retail <b>store's</b> <b>layout.</b> The ultimate effectiveness of the planogram can be measured by sales volume.|$|R

50|$|The {{resulting}} {{information is}} intended to help businesses {{make sense of the}} large amounts of incoming video data. Prism Skylabs’ goal is to enable companies to better analyze long-term trends, such as number of customers, check-out queue lengths, foot traffic patterns, dwell time and the most popular products in a store. Retailers use this information to improve merchandising, <b>store</b> <b>layout</b> and customer service efforts and increase operational efficiencies.|$|E

In April 1991, {{in an effort to}} strengthen its financial position, the company secured a $40 million refinancing agreement and closed 11 unprofitable stores. In January 1993, Jamesway rolled out a new store format and planned to completely remodel the 127-store chain within the following three years. The remodel would include completely redoing 30 stores in 1993. The remodeling efforts included better lighting, <b>store</b> <b>layouts,</b> and signage improvements throughout the store.|$|R
50|$|The savings {{achieved}} by conducting product development with Fast Fit (perhaps {{more so than}} in many other enterprise-level systems, since Fast Fit solutions can typically deliver a return on investment in quite short order) can be re-invested into the business, helping to drive the creation of new, fresh products (and a greater number of variations on existing products). Similarly, those savings delivered above the requirements of product development can be invested in <b>store</b> <b>layouts,</b> advertising and other methods of creating demand - drawing consumers back to the retail experience.|$|R
