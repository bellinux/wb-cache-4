40|$|The {{automobile}} market is, nowadays, {{characterized by}} a growing demand for cars equipped with diesel engines. This is because these offer smaller fuel consumption and better engine performance. A modern common rail turbocharged diesel engine provides performance equal to a gasoline engine, with same displacement, not turbo-charged but with a higher torque at lower engine speeds and with smaller fuel consumption. The methyl esters of vegetable oils, known as biodiesel, are receiving increasing interest because of their low environmental impact and their potential as an alternative fuel for diesel engines as they would not require any significant modification of existing engines. The modern common rail (CR) diesel engines are normally optimized for commercial diesel fuel. Consequently, the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) calibrations are defined to offer the best compromise between performance and emissions. If the engine is fuelled with an alternative fuel with different characteristics (net heating value, <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>air</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> (a/f), density, viscosity, etc.), {{it is clear that}} the calibration must be modified. In past experiments the authors have demonstrated that it is possible to optimize emissions and performances of a light duty CR diesel engine fueled with a vegetable derived fuel (rapeseed methyl ester) pure or blended with commercial diesel fuel, changing ECU parameters. This paper will show a detailed analysis of combustion in a modern diesel engine fueled with biodiesel and in particular some of the influences on engine parameters will be analyzed in order to demonstrate how an optimization strategy of ECU parameters could be applied to a diesel engine, when it is fueled with different fuels, with different physical/chemical characteristics...|$|E

A standard speed load point of 2000 rpm and 2. 7 bar IMEP 720 ° has been reached by throttling the intake whilst running standard cam profiles, by early closing of both inlet valves (EIVC) and by early closing of each inlet individually to generate bulk swirl motions within the cylinder. Data has been recorded at <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>air</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>ratios</b> for both direct injection and port fuelled operation. The valve profiles have been applied to two single cylinder homogeneous gasoline direct injection (GDI) spark ignition engines, developed to investigate the potential of controlling engine load by limiting the inducted air mass using fully variable valve timing (FVVT) to reduce pumping losses at part load. The first engine featured a full length optical liner, allowing 2 D Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements of the intake flow fields to be made, along with Mie imaging studies of the liquid fuel fraction. The second was a thermodynamic engine equipped to measure specific fuel consumption and emissions of CO 2, CO, NOX and THC.

Differently {{from the common}} CLC process, high enough temperatures were obtained by burning air and methane mixture directly {{in the bed of}} carriers, changing the <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>air</b> to <b>fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> in the range of 0. 70 to 1. 30 and using external electric heating. None of the five particle samples tested showed any sign of defluidization in oxidizing atmosphere at any of the temperatures tested, i. e. up to 1175 – 1185  ∘C. However, under reducing conditions or in the oxidizing-reducing sequences, shortly after changing the atmosphere from oxidative to reducing, some of the spray-dried samples agglomerated causing defluidization. To study the structure of the carrier particles and to clarify the agglomeration phenomena, SEM and EDX analysis of the initial and treated samples was carried out. It was shown that agglomerates are formed through small bridges between the particles which consist of pure Ni phase. Three samples which were produced using MgO as an additive were tested. For these no defluidization was observed at any of the temperatures tested, i. e. up to 1175 – 1185  ∘C, neither in oxidizing, nor in reducing atmosphere.

40|$|The US {{economy is}} linked to {{efficient}} heavy vehicle transportation and diesel remains the fuel of choice for mass transportation of goods and services. Diesel engines remain the most reliable and cost effective system for commerce. Recent deleterious effects of diesel exhaust on health and environment have led to an urgent need for cost effective technologies that would bring about reduction in NOx and PM. CARB estimates on-road diesel mobile source will contribute almost 50 % NOx and 78 % PM emissions by 2010. As a result recent Federal and State mandates have been adopted to reduce emissions from diesel exhaust to 1 Gm/bhp. -Hr of NOx and 0. 05 Gm/bhp-hr of PM by the year 2007. The 2007 standard is to be achieved in a stepwise manner starting with the standards for 2002 namely 2 Gm/bhp-hr NOx and 0. 1 Gm/bhp-hr of PM. 2002 standards {{are likely to be}} met by most engine manufacturer by some modified form of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system or by employing a sophisticated engine control system. Importance of cost effective technology requirement is further exaggerated by the fact that in recent years diesel engine production have increased dramatically see figure 1 and has out stripped the gasoline engine production almost 4 : 1 see figure 2. Currently gasoline engine employs a 3 -way catalytic system for NOx and HC reduction and in order for the 3 -way system to work the engine is run near <b>stoichiometric</b> <b>air</b> : <b>fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> so that exhaust has virtually no oxygen.

Major portion of today’s energy demand in India is being met with fossil fuels. Hence it is high time that alternate fuels for engines should be derived from indigenous sources.

The present work focused only on non-edible oils as fuel for engines, as the edible oils are in great demand and far too expensive. The past work revealed that uses of vegetable oils for engines in place of diesel were investigated. The present investigations are planned after a thorough review of literature in this area.

40|$|This report, An Experimental Evaluation of Low Calorific Value Gaseous Fuels as a Heat Source for Stirling Engines, {{was written}} by Johan Westerberg as a Master's thesis at Chalmers University of Technology. It covers the topic of MILD {{combustion}} of liquid propane gas, G 25 natural gas, synthesis gas and landfill gas, of which the latter two represents low calorific gaseous fuels. The investigated engine was a C 9 G Stirling engine from Cleanergy. The primary incentive to {{this study was to}} determine if steady and reliable operation of the C 9 G Stirling engine could be maintained while using low calorific gaseous fuels. Another incentive to this project was to achieve further understanding of the combustion device, which purpose is to supply the Stirling engine with heat. Thus, an understanding of the changed characteristics caused by varying the <b>air</b> to <b>fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> was targeted. Engine operation by use of landfill gas, made up by 20 percent methane in carbon dioxide and nitrogen, was successful at the lowest load setting allowed by the C 9 G engine, generating 1 : 5 kW of shaft power. For liquid propane gas and G 25 natural gas, up to 10 : 9 kW of shaft power was generated. Combustion of synthesis gas was not attempted due to the hazard of carbon monoxide poisoning, caused by insufficient ventilation in the test cell. Apparent changes in energy ows and temperatures within the combustion device at varied <b>air</b> to <b>fuel</b> <b>ratios</b> suggest that incomplete combustion prior to the heat sink of the Stirling engine was an issue, especially at low to moderate <b>air</b> to <b>fuel</b> <b>ratios.</b> Further, a reversed ow direction through the ue gas recirculation cavities was observed when high ow rates of fuel, which primarily occurs for high load settings and low <b>air</b> to <b>fuel</b> <b>ratios,</b> was supplied to the engine.

Particulate matter emissions were considerably reduced with ethanol-diesel, biodiesel-diesel blends in comparison to pure diesel. With EGR rate the particulate matter emissions are increased. An EGR rate of 10 % will be best for the present engine which can give better trade-off among HC, NOx and PM...|$|R
50|$|This {{engine was}} used in the 1998-2002 Honda Accord ULEV models. It is {{substantially}} similar to the F23A1, but features ULEV certification with a slight reduction of power: 148 hp (108 kW) with a maximum torque of 150 lb·ft (203 Nm). This engine has a different exhaust manifold, a more restrictive intake manifold and cylinder head, and a 32-bit ECU that uses an AFR (<b>Air</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Ratio)</b> oxygen sensor when compared to the F23A1.|$|R
40|$|Because of the {{coexistence}} of liquid and gaseous fuel phases in an aero engine combustor with typical air blast atomiser the soot formation process cannot {{be traced back}} unambiguously to physical effects of the one chemical or kinetical effects of the other phase. The objective of this task was to improve understanding of soot formation and its dependence on droplet properties. Soot formation from a monodisperse droplet stream has been detected in a basic experiment with well defined initial conditions of droplet size, droplet concentration, <b>air</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>ratio,</b> liquid physical properties, etc. An existing experimental test rig has been adapted to study soot formation during the combustion of a monosized droplet stream of hydrocarbon <b>fuel</b> in <b>air.</b> Compounds and composition of the fuel has been defined in another task of this project. The two phase flow was characterised in non reacting conditions {{by the use of}} optical techniques. Operating conditions were variable pressure and droplet concentration, and liquid kerosenelike fuels. The analysis of soot appearance and evolution correlated with a parametric variation of operating conditions (pressure, <b>air</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>ratio,</b> residence time, temperature) was realised using laser-induced incandescence (LII). ...|$|R
5000|$|Though by tuning {{primarily}} by EGT and <b>air</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>ratio</b> values, EGT {{is still to}} this day a used data output for engine tuning. When fine tuning an engine, if possible with the ECU manipulation with the cylinder's timing can be made. By adjusting the timing, the resultant cylinder temperature {{can be used to}} improve cylinder efficiency. Though this is still widely done, EGT values should be used as a safe guard sensor measure and as a tuning guide. 1 ...|$|R
