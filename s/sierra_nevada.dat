5|$|The {{route of}} US395 in California is {{split into two}} segments, as the highway exits and reenters California via Nevada. The {{southern}} segment crosses the Mojave Desert and Owens Valley and passes east of the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada.</b> The northern segment also follows the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> and crosses the Modoc Plateau.|$|E

Sherwin Summit, at , {{is the first of}} five {{mountain}} passes crossed by US395 in the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada.</b> The highway enters Mono County midway up the ascent, called the Sherwin Grade.|$|E
5|$|Basement rock {{under the}} Mono–Inyo chain {{consists}} of the same granitic and metamorphic rock {{that make up the}} <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada.</b> Above that layer are basaltic grading to rhyolitic volcanic rocks that are 3.5 million to less than 760,000 years old. Volcanism occurred north of the chain, in the Bodie Hills, as far back as 28 million years. Nearly all the rock east of the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> in the Mono Basin area is volcanic in origin.|$|E

5|$|Nearby <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> Brewing Company {{partnered with}} the monks of New Clairvaux {{to make a}} series of Belgian-style beers under the Ovila Abbey brand. In late 2010, the beer {{producer}} launched a website to tell about {{the making of the}} beer product line and the story of the restoration of the stones. <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> founder Ken Grossman said he had long been interested in making a line of Belgian beers, and the abbey's project provided a good opportunity. The first product, a Dubbel, was released in March 2011, followed in July by a Saison and in November by a Quadrupel. <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> has dedicated a percentage of the beer sales to assist in funding the rebuilding project.|$|E
5|$|Starting 10 {{million years}} ago, {{vertical}} movement along the Sierra fault started to uplift the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada.</b> Subsequent tilting of the Sierra block {{and the resulting}} accelerated uplift of the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> increased the gradient of western-flowing streams. The streams consequently ran faster and thus cut their valleys more quickly. Additional uplift occurred when major faults developed to the east, especially the creation of Owens Valley from Basin and Range-associated extensional forces. Uplift of the Sierra accelerated again about two million years ago during the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|The Mono–Inyo {{chain of}} craters lies in east-central California, roughly {{parallel}} to the eastern escarpment of the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> mountain range. Volcanism and seismic activity in eastern California {{are a result of}} two major geologic processes: northwest movement of the Pacific Plate with respect to the North American Plate along the San Andreas Fault system near the coast, and east–west extension of the crust that formed the Basin and Range Province. In the Long Valley region, where the craters are located, basin and range extension encroaches onto the thick and stable crust of the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although European foxes were {{introduced}} to portions of the United States in the 1900s recent genetic investigation indicates an absence of European fox haplotypes in any North American populations. Also, introduced eastern red foxes have colonized southern California, the San Joaquin Valley, and San Francisco Bay Area, but appear to have mixed with the Sacramento Valley red fox V.v.patwin only in a narrow hybrid zone. In addition, no evidence is seen of interbreeding of eastern red foxes in California with the montane <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> red fox V.v.necator or other populations in the Intermountain West (between the Rocky Mountains {{to the east and}} the Cascade and <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> ranges to the west.|$|E

5|$|State Route 190 (SR 190) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California that is split into two parts by the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada.</b> The western portion begins at Tipton at a {{junction}} with State Route 99 and heads east towards Porterville before ending at Quaking Aspen in the Sequoia National Forest. The eastern portion begins at US 395 at Olancha, heads east through Death Valley National Park, and ends at State Route 127 at Death Valley Junction. The 43.0-mile (69.2km) portion over the <b>Sierra</b> <b>Nevada</b> remains unconstructed, and the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) {{has no plans to}} build it through the wilderness areas. SR 190 is a National Scenic Byway known as the Death Valley Scenic Byway.|$|E
