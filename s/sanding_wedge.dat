5000|$|The modern <b>sand</b> <b>wedge</b> still {{uses the}} ideas of high mass, high loft, and bounce angle, but the modern <b>sand</b> <b>wedge</b> clubhead has much higher mass than earlier designs, up to 40oz (2.5 lb, 1.13 kg), to drive the clubhead through the firmer sand found in many courses. There can also be {{differences}} in shaft length; while some <b>sand</b> <b>wedges</b> follow the systematic progression of shorter shaft lengths for higher lofts, many <b>sand</b> <b>wedges</b> are longer than the adjacent lofted wedges. This encourages the player to hit <b>sand</b> <b>wedge</b> shots [...] "fat" [...] (the club hits the ground before the ball), which on a firm lie is generally bad, {{but in the case}} of a ball embedded or buried in soft bunker sand this will get the clubhead all the way under the ball to lift it out. The resulting plume of sand from such a shot was made famous by Sarazen as the [...] "explosion shot" [...] and is a common sight in televised golf events.|$|R
5000|$|Gap wedges are loosely defined, but {{typically}} have the loft between {{that of a}} pitching <b>wedge</b> and <b>sand</b> <b>wedge,</b> between 50 and 54 degrees. At the extremes there is redundancy with either the pitching wedge (typically 48°) or the <b>sand</b> <b>wedge</b> (typically 56°), however some players will [...] "fine-tune" [...] the lofts of these other wedges to their play style, leading to alternate loft choices for a gap wedge. Most players look for a separation of 4 degrees between clubs, and so with the standard pitching and <b>sand</b> <b>wedge</b> lofts, the complementary gap wedge would be 52°.|$|R
40|$|Sand and sand-ice {{fillings}} of Quaternary {{thermal contraction}} cracks on Summer and Hadwen Islands, Western Arctic Canada, comprise <b>sand</b> veins, <b>sand</b> <b>wedges,</b> and composite <b>wedges.</b> <b>Sand</b> <b>wedges</b> in diamicton-poor ice, diamicton-rich ice, and ice-rich sand generally have simple V shapes, whereas those in ice-poor sand vary from V-shaped to irregular forms and may contain inclusions of host sand. These morphological differences are {{explained in terms}} of the relative tensile strength of the wedge and host materials. Bundles of sand veins within <b>sand</b> <b>wedges</b> indicate discrete stages of wedge growth. Criteria previously proposed for identifying relict <b>sand</b> <b>wedges</b> are reevaluated: (1) Not all wedges are V. shaped; some are irregular forms with offshoot sand veins. (2) A vertical or steeply dipping lamination is not apparent within all wedges; some appear to have a massive fill, suggesting that the sand source can be texturally and mineralogically very uniform. (3) Individual sand veins and groups of veins can be just as common within sandy host materials as the better-known <b>sand</b> <b>wedges.</b> Composite sand-ice wedges at Crumbling Point, Summer Island, commenced growth as composite <b>wedges,</b> continued as <b>sand</b> <b>wedges,</b> were modified by thermokarst, and, in some cases, recommenced at a stratigraphically higher level as ice wedges. The sand-wedge and ice-wedge stages reflect environmental change from cold, arid, and windy proglacial conditions during Oxygen Isotope Stage 2 to warmer and wetter interglacial conditions during OI Stage 1...|$|R
40|$|Sedimentary {{structures}} {{formed by}} the progressive primary infilling of thermal contraction cracks with sand are termed primary sand veins and <b>sand</b> <b>wedges.</b> In addition to simple vein- or wedge-shapes irregularities {{can be caused by}} sand veins branching from their sides and toes. Primary <b>sand</b> <b>wedges</b> form widely in sandy polar deserts, locally in sandy areas of tundra and probably in seasonally frozen ground. There are no unique criteria for distinguishing primary <b>sand</b> veins and <b>wedges</b> from <b>sand</b> veins and <b>wedges</b> of other origins. Identification of the former depends on the occurrence of distinctive features not always present and on evaluation of their lithofacies and palaeoenvironmental contexts. Care and caution are advocated in the use of ancient/relict primary <b>sand</b> veins and <b>wedges</b> as quantitative palaeoenvironmental indicators because modern active wedge distribution is poorly known and hence inferred thermal climatic threshold values are questionable. It is suggested that ancient/relict primary <b>sand</b> <b>wedges</b> exceeding 2 m in depth and with well-developed vertical lamination probably indicate the former occurrence of continuous permafrost, whereas sand veins and narrow <b>sand</b> <b>wedges</b> (frost cracks) are potentially ambiguous as they may form not only in the active layer above and within continuous permafrost but also in seasonally frozen ground in non-permafrost areas...|$|R

25|$|In 1932 Wilson Advisory {{staff member}} Gene Sarazen was {{inspired}} by the aerodynamics of an airplane's wing to create a club head that would glide smoothly through sand. Sarazen welded a piece of steel to the sole of the club and ground it producing ‘bounce’. This marked the introduction of the <b>sand</b> <b>wedge</b> and in 1933 alone, Wilson sold 50,000 of these clubs, marketed as the R-90, which went on to be the most popular <b>sand</b> <b>wedge</b> in golf.|$|R
5000|$|However, <b>sand</b> <b>wedges</b> {{generally}} {{have not received}} this same reduction in loft, even as they were designed with similar weight-distribution and backspin-improving features. This is because the <b>sand</b> <b>wedge</b> is typically not used with distance in mind; its eponymous purpose requires the traditional 54-56° loft angle in order to dig into the soft sand surrounding the ball and lift it out. The <b>sand</b> <b>wedge's</b> nominal loft and [...] "bounce" [...] angles have not changed appreciably from Gene Sarazen's original concept based on the niblick. Cavity-backed, perimeter-weighted sets may de-loft this club by a degree or two compared to a forged set, but this is nowhere near the amount of loft reduction seen in the numbered irons.

The established protocol was then applied to <b>sand</b> <b>wedge</b> sediments found in the region in order to date periods of permafrost and to provide limiting ages on glaciation. The suitable SAR protocol incorporates a 200 oC/ 10 s preheat for both the additive-dose and test dose measurements, a hot (290 oC) bleach step at the end of each SAR cycle to reduce recuperation, and measurement of the stimulated luminescence at 50 oC. A select number of <b>sand</b> <b>wedges</b> found throughout the region were dated using the established protocol. Those that yielded reliable ages date to the last glaciation.

The sand sheets also contain rejuvenated (syngenetic) <b>sand</b> <b>wedges</b> that have grown upward from an erosion surface.

5000|$|Sarazen's new club, {{including}} the wide, angled sole, was ruled legal by both R&A and USGA authorities, {{and the club}} itself and its basic design concepts became widely copied by other golfers and by club manufacturers. As irons became more standardized in the 20s through the 40s, the wide sole of the <b>sand</b> <b>wedge</b> was copied on other mid- and high-lofted irons to add mass, which compensates for the progressively shorter shaft lengths to provide a similar feel across all the irons with a given swing. The highest-lofted irons got the most additional weight, resulting in the widest soles, giving these clubs the same eponymous wedge-shaped profile as the <b>sand</b> <b>wedge.</b> This led to the tradition of calling these high-lofted irons [...] "wedges", regardless {{of the amount of}} bounce (angle of the sole to the ground) that the sole provided.|$|R
50|$|Sarazen {{invented the}} modern <b>sand</b> <b>wedge,</b> and debuted the club (while keeping it secret during {{preliminary}} practice rounds) at The Open Championship at Prince's Golf Club in 1932 (which he won).

50|$|Gene Sarazen {{began to}} win tournaments in 1935 {{with a new}} club he had invented that was {{specialized}} for sand play. He is hailed as {{the inventor of the}} <b>sand</b> <b>wedge.</b> However, history goes about 3 years further back than that. Spoon clubs offered varying degrees of loft and allowed players to scoop their ball out of sand traps and deep rough. As manufacturers became more and more innovative with club design, new types of wedges appeared. Some had concave faces, others featured deeply grooved faces, but not all of these designs conformed to USGA and R&A regulations, and many were banned. With the concave-faced wedge having been outlawed in 1931, Sarazen designed his <b>sand</b> <b>wedge</b> with a straight face. Another modification that he made was to add extra lead to the front edge of the club face, allowing it to cut through the sand more smoothly. After he won the 1932 British and U.S. Opens {{with the help of his}} new club, its popularity quickly grew.|$|R
5000|$|The {{relation}} between actual loft and bounce can change {{based on how}} the player addresses the ball; the more forward the ball, and the more open the clubface, the higher the effective loft and bounce angles. Some clubmakers will vary the amount of bounce that the sole has from toe to heel, allowing the player to fine-tune the club to the specific situation by opening it. When square at address, such a club behaves more like a lower-bounce pitching wedge, while when opened, the club behaves more like a <b>sand</b> <b>wedge</b> (without the bounce becoming too high and making a [...] "skulled" [...] shot more likely, as it would with a constant bounce angle from tow to heel). A few manufacturers call attention to this by labeling the wedge [...] "D" [...] for [...] "dual wedge", indicating {{it can be used}} as either a pitching or <b>sand</b> <b>wedge</b> (or anything in between).|$|R
40|$|International audienceSandbox {{modeling}} is used {{to study}} the deformation of accretionary wedges caused by the subduction of oceanic ridges. The first experiment incorporates a massive ridge within a <b>sand</b> <b>wedge.</b> The wedge thickens and shortens when the forward propagation of the basal decollement ceases. The wedge thickening results in taper change, reactivation of preexisting thrusts, and retreat of the frontal part of the <b>sand</b> <b>wedge.</b> Similar mechanisms may have affected some margins that have undergone ridge subduction such as the Tonga margin after the subduction of the oblique Louisville oceanic ridge. The second experiment shows the effects of an active basement thrust slice as it enters a subduction zone. This process may {{have happened in the}} eastern Nankai accretionary wedge. Initially, the wedge in this experiment behaved similarly to that of the first experiment. Rapidly the topographic slope changed, the wedge thickened above the basement slice generating a slope break in the topography; a deeper propagating accretionary wedge again characterized by a small taper developed. These results, when compared with observations made in the Eastern Nankai Trench, are in agreement with the past subduction of a basement thrust slice in this area...|$|R

40|$|A {{distinctive}} northwest-to-southeast topographic grain {{consisting of}} fluted-ridge and trough landforms, aligned drainages, and elongated basins extends {{across much of}} northeastern Nebraska. Late Wisconsinan wind-scouring superimposed these oriented topographic features upon an existing dissected landscape composed mostly of older Pleistocene sediments. Subsequent loess deposition covered this deflated land-surface and preserved the character of former surficial elements. These paleosurface components include cover sands, ventifacts, wind-polished pebbles, <b>sand</b> <b>wedges,</b> ice-wedge casts, soil flow deposits, and scattered, predeflationary paleosol remnants. Ventifact fabric diagrams conform to landform alignments and independently substantiate the existence of northwest paleowinds. Locally, up to 20 meters of sediment may have been deflated from the till/outwash substrate to produce the fluted landforms. Cold, dry climatic conditions have been interpreted for this deflationary episode based upon comparable Atterberg Limit values between deformed and undeformed active layer sediments, and the scarcity of cryodisturbance structures. In northeast Nebraska, <b>sand</b> <b>wedges</b> and polygonal patterned ground are landscape position-dependent. This and the association of cover sands with fluted landforms suggest {{that a combination of}} aspect, stratigraphy, thermal contraction, and particle abrasion promoted the development of the oriented topography. Sieve analysis reveals that an upward-fining, particle-size continuum exists between <b>sand</b> <b>wedges,</b> cover <b>sands,</b> and sandy loess. The trend of lineated landforms in northeast Nebraska is similar to orientations observed elsewhere in the central mid-continent. Wind-aligned landforms discontinuously parallel the Late Wisconsinan glacial margin from central Montana to western Illinois. This geographic landform assemblage is associated with evidence of past permafrost conditions, suggesting the presence of an ice-marginal, cryodeflationary belt. This wedge-shaped, permafrost/paleowind corridor narrows to the east and south where the alignment pattern of wind-generated landforms changes from the prevailing northwest to a west-northwest orientation. The regional distribution of cryodeflationary indicators suggests the need for a reevaluation of initial Nebraska Sand Hills 2 ̆ 7 dune formation and for the origin of the Iowan Erosion Surface. ...|$|R
