Some household products use enzymes to speed up chemical reactions: enzymes in biological washing powders break down protein, starch or fat <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> clothes, and enzymes in meat tenderizer break down proteins into smaller molecules, making the meat easier to chew.|$|E
5|$|Cytochemical <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> {{blood and}} bone marrow smears are helpful in the {{distinction}} of AML from ALL, and in subclassification of AML. The combination of a myeloperoxidase or Sudan black stain and a nonspecific esterase stain will provide the desired information in most cases. The myeloperoxidase or Sudan black reactions are most useful in establishing the identity of AML and distinguishing it from ALL. The nonspecific esterase stain is used to identify a monocytic component in AMLs and to distinguish a poorly differentiated monoblastic leukemia from ALL.|$|E

Police stated that DNA tests would be conducted on the clothes, skin found under the victim's fingernails, and the previously recovered tennis racquet. Ricardo Flores stated in interviews that his daughter's body needed to be exhumed to gather the fingernail DNA evidence, and that her body had not been cremated for this reason.|$|E

5|$|On Monday, April 28, Frank, {{accompanied}} by his attorney, Luther Rosser, gave a written deposition to the police that provided a brief timeline of his activities on Saturday. He said Phagan was in his office between 12:05 and 12:10p.m., that Lee had arrived at 4p.m. but was asked to return later, and that Frank had a confrontation with ex-employee James Gantt at 6p.m. as Frank was leaving and Lee arriving. Frank explained that Lee's time card for Sunday morning had several gaps (Lee was supposed to punch in every half-hour) that Frank had missed when he discussed the time card with police on Sunday. At Rosser's insistence, Frank exposed his body to demonstrate {{that he had no}} cuts or injuries and the police found no blood on the suit that Frank said he had worn on Saturday. The police found no blood <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> the laundry at Frank's house.|$|E
5|$|Ron (Nick Offerman) sends Leslie (Amy Poehler) to run {{an errand}} at the DMV in Pawnee Hall's fourth floor, a dark and unsettling place that {{includes}} probation offices and divorce filings. A reluctant and frightened Leslie navigates past reprobates and blood <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> the floor and spots Tom (Aziz Ansari) leaving the divorce office with his wife Wendy (Jama Williamson). Unaware that their relationship was a green card marriage to prevent Wendy from being deported back to Canada, Leslie later tries to comfort Tom, who insists he is fine. Nevertheless, Leslie persists in her efforts to cheer him up, in part by ordering a singing horse telegram to cheer him up. Ron, who knows about Tom's fake marriage, suggests Tom act sad so Leslie can feel like she cheered him up. When Leslie sets up a social event to cheer him up, Tom suggests a strip club, but Leslie follows Jerry's (Jim O'Heir) suggestion {{they go to the}} dinosaur-themed restaurant, Jurassic Fork.|$|E
5|$|On December 23, Flood {{ordered an}} {{examination}} of Mary Celeste, which {{was carried out by}} John Austin, Surveyor of Shipping, with the assistance of a diver, Ricardo Portunato. Austin noted cuts {{on each side of the}} bow, caused, he thought, by a sharp instrument, and found possible traces of blood on the captain's sword. His report emphasized that the ship did not appear to have been struck by heavy weather, citing a phial of sewing machine oil found upright in its place. Austin did not acknowledge that the phial might have been replaced since the abandonment, nor did the court raise this point. Portunato's report on the hull concluded that the ship had not been involved in a collision or run aground. A further inspection by a group of Royal Naval captains endorsed Austin's opinion that the cuts on the bow had been caused deliberately. They also discovered <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> one of the ship's rails that might have been blood, together with a deep mark possibly caused by an axe. These findings strengthened Flood's suspicions that human wrongdoing rather than natural disaster lay behind the mystery. On January 22, 1873, he sent the reports to the Board of Trade in London, adding his own conclusion that the crew had got at the alcohol (he ignored its non-potability) and murdered the Briggs family and the ship's officers in a drunken frenzy. They had cut the bows to simulate a collision, then fled in the yawl to suffer an unknown fate. Flood thought that Morehouse and his men were hiding something, specifically that Mary Celeste had been abandoned in a more easterly location, and that the log had been doctored. He could not accept that Mary Celeste could have traveled so far while unmanned.|$|E

25|$|IRS is {{effective}} if at least 80% {{of homes and}} barns in a residential area are sprayed. Lower coverage rates can jeopardize program effectiveness. Many residents resist DDT spraying, objecting to the lingering smell, <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> walls, and the potential exacerbation of problems with other insect pests. Pyrethroid insecticides (e.g. deltamethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin) can overcome some of these issues, increasing participation.|$|E

25|$|The sloping {{corridor}} {{beyond the}} entrance was partially filled with rubble.

25|$|The main rail {{yard and}} {{locomotive}} and car shops are in Greenville, Pennsylvania. Although the B acquired some early diesel-electric switching locomotives painted black with yellow trim, in 1950 the company adopted a locomotive color scheme of bright orange and black {{which is still}} in use.

25|$|There {{are several}} reddish <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> the shroud {{suggesting}} blood, {{but it is}} uncertain whether these stains were produced {{at the same time}} as the image, or afterwards. McCrone (see painting hypothesis) identified these as containing iron oxide, theorizing that its presence was likely due to simple pigment materials used in medieval times. Other researchers, including Alan Adler, identified the reddish stains as blood and interpreted the iron oxide as a natural residue of hemoglobin.|$|E
25|$|Pet clips can be {{as simple}} or as {{elaborate}} as owners wish. The hair under the tail should always be kept short to keep feces from matting in the dog's curls. Most owners also keep the feet and face clipped short to prevent dirt from matting between toes, tear <b>stains</b> <b>on</b> lighter-coated poodles and food from matting around the dog's muzzle. Beyond these sanitary requirements, desired clips depend on owners' preferences. Some owners maintain a longer clip in winter than summer.|$|E

40|$|Two {{electron}} microscopic staining techniques, one using tannic acid-glutaraldehyde as a fixative, and {{the other}} using tannic acid-uranyl acetate solution as a <b>stain</b> <b>on</b> ultra-thin sections of glutaraldehyde fixed material, were directly compared for elastic fibre <b>staining</b> <b>on</b> several human and animal tissues. Various concentrations of tannic acid were compared using both techniques. The two techniques were also compared on formalin fixed tissues.

It is suggested that {{the use of the term}} tannic acid technique/method should be reserved for this particular method to achieve a meaningful interpretation of results in scientific papers...|$|R
