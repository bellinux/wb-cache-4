5000|$|The exact {{composition}} of Essiac is unclear, but it reportedly contains burdock (Arctium lappa), <b>sheep</b> <b>sorrel</b> (Rumex acetosella), slippery elm bark (Ulmus rubra), and Indian rhubarb (Rheum officinale) or turkey rhubarb (Rheum palmatum). Some formulations may also contain watercress, blessed thistle, red clover, and kelp. From the 1920s through the 1970s, Essiac was promoted as a cancer treatment by Rene Caisse, a Canadian nurse, {{who claimed that}} it had been given to her by an Ontario Ojibwa patient she treated. However, this has never been substantiated. There is no evidence that Essiac is a Native American or First Nations remedy, and there are multiple factors that indicate the formula is not from any Native American culture. Several of the plants in the mixture (burdock, <b>sheep</b> <b>sorrel,</b> Indian rhubarb and turkey rhubarb) are not indigenous to the Americas, and were not growing in the wilds of Northern Ontario during the time Caisse began prescribing this tea.

50|$|Rumex acetosella, {{commonly}} known as <b>sheep's</b> <b>sorrel,</b> red sorrel, sour weed and field sorrel, is a species of flowering plant in the buckwheat family Polygonaceae. The plant and its subspecies are common perennial weeds. It has green arrowhead-shaped leaves and red-tinted deeply ridged stems, and it sprouts from an aggressive and spreading rhizome. The flowers emerge from a tall, upright stem. Female flowers are maroon in color.|$|R
50|$|These {{plants are}} edible. The leaves of most species contain oxalic acid and tannin, {{and many have}} {{astringent}} and slightly purgative qualities. Some species with particularly high levels of oxalic acid are called <b>sorrels</b> (including <b>sheep's</b> <b>sorrel,</b> Rumex acetosella, common sorrel, Rumex acetosa, and French sorrel, Rumex scutatus), {{and some of these}} are grown as leaf vegetables or garden herbs for their acidic taste.|$|R

40|$|Background/PurposePollen allergy is {{believed}} to be less common in East Asia, Latin America, and tropical areas. The {{purpose of this study was}} to understand the role of pollen allergy in Taiwan. MethodsPatients with clinically diagnosed allergic rhinitis were enrolled. All subjects received a 30 -item skin test panel that included perennial allergens (house dust mix, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae, dog epithelium, cat hairs, cockroach mix, and Candida albicans) and pollen allergens (acacia, pine mix, eucalyptus, beefwood, juniper mix, willow, mulberry mix, pepper tree, cedar, Johnson grass, Bermuda grass, ragweed mix, Timothy grass, spiny pigweed, cocklebur, sage mix, <b>sheep</b> <b>sorrel,</b> dog fennel, pigweed mix, English plantain, castor bean, alfalfa, and dandelion). ResultsA total of 419 patients were recruited. A total of 313 (74. 7 %) had a positive skin test. A total of 288 patients (68. 7 %) were sensitive to perennial allergens, and 11 8 patients (28. 2 %) were sensitive to pollen allergens. However, 93 pollen-sensitive patients were also sensitive to perennial allergens, and only 25 were sensitive to pollen allergens alone. The most common allergens were D. pteronyssinus, D. farinae, house dust mix, and cockroach, but the most common pollen allergens were spiny pigweed, Johnson grass, and <b>sheep</b> <b>sorrel.</b> All nasal symptoms tended to be more severe in patients who were sensitive to perennial allergens than in those who were sensitive to pollen allergens alone. ConclusionMost patients with allergic rhinitis in Taiwan are sensitive to perennial allergens, and pollens are a less common allergen...|$|E
30|$|In Canadian {{traditional}} medicine, the burdock root (Arctium lappa), {{the inner}} bark of slippery elm (Ulmus fulva or Ulmus rubra), <b>sheep</b> <b>sorrel</b> (Rumex acetosella), and rhubarb (Rheum palmatum) {{have been reported}} to have anticancer activity (Minyi, 1992). A widely used herbal extract formulation (Essiac®) has been commercially produced and it is widely used as a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by some cancer patients and survivors (Kulp et al., 2006). These four plants were reported to have hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory (A. lappa, R. palmatum), strong antioxidant and free radical scavenging (A. lappa), gastroprotective (R. palmatum, U. rubra), and anti-septic and anti-spasmodic (R. palmatum) activities (Bradley, 1992; Lin, Lin, Yang, Chuang, & Ujiie, 1996; Duh, 1998; Tamayo, Richardson, Diamond, & Skoda, 2000; Lin et al., 2002).

40|$|Background: Breast {{cancer is}} {{a major cause of}} morbidity, mortality, and medical {{expenditures}} among women in Canada. Essiac (Resperin™ Canada Limited, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada), a blend of at least four herbs (burdock root [Arctium lappa], Indian rhubarb [Rheum palmatum], <b>sheep</b> <b>sorrel</b> [Rumex acetosella], and the inner bark of slippery elm [Ulmus fulva or U. rubra]), {{has become one of the}} more popular herbal remedies for breast-cancer treatment, secondary prevention, improving quality of life, and controlling negative side-effects of conventional breast-cancer treatment. Objectives: Our primary objective was to determine the difference in health-related quality of life (HR-QOL), as assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Breast Cancer Version, between women who are new Essiac users (since breast cancer diagnosis) and those who have never used Essiac. Secondary endpoints included differences in depression, anxiety, fatigue, rate of adverse events, and prevalence of complications or benefits associated with Essiac during standard breast-cancer treatment. Additionally, we described the pattern of use of Essiac in this cohort of women. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study in 510 women, randomly chosen from the Ontario Cancer Tumour Registry, with a diagnosis of primary breast cancer in 2003. Results: With the exception changes in a Physical well-being subscale and a relationship with doctor subscale, Essiac did not have a significant effect on HR-QOL or mood states. Even for Physical well-being and relationship with doctor, Essiac seemed to have a negative effect, with Essiac users doing worse than the non-Essiac users. This might be attributed to the fact that the group of users comprised younger women with more advanced stages of breast cancer, and both of these subgroups of patients have been shown to be at a significantly increased risk for negative mood states and/or a decreased sense of well-being. The women were taking low doses (total daily dose 43. 6 ± 30. 8 mL) of Essiac that corresponded to the label directions found on most Essiac products. Friends were the most common source of information, and most women were taking Essiac to boost their immune systems or increase their chances of survival. Only 2 women reported minor adverse events, whereas numerous women reported beneficial effects of Essiac. Conclusions: Essiac does not appear to improve HR-QOL or mood states. Future studies are needed to determine whether other clinical outcomes, such as cancer reoccurrence, are affected by Essiac...|$|E
