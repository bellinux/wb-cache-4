40|$|The {{market for}} <b>sustainable</b> <b>buildings</b> has rapidly gained {{momentum}} {{in the design and}} construction phases, however it appears that development and investment in these buildings by the private sector is limited. This is further complicated by the limited information available confirming the financial viability of <b>sustainable</b> <b>buildings,</b> with relatively little research conducted into the relationship between sustainability and the market value of commercial buildings. Currently the demand for <b>sustainable</b> <b>buildings</b> in Australia and New Zealand is being encouraged through government legislation and policy, where investment by the private sector has been relatively slow to develop {{due to the lack of}} evidential proof of the economic viability of <b>sustainable</b> <b>buildings.</b> Clearly if the progress and uptake of <b>sustainable</b> <b>buildings</b> is to develop within the property market, it is essential that the relationship between market value and sustainability should be understood in order to fully inform the investment industry. <br /...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sustainable</b> <b>buildings</b> {{have often}} been niche products, {{but in recent years}} a new {{approach}} has emerged in Denmark aimed at mainstreaming and normalizing this mode of construction and seeking to attract ordinary Danes through market conditions. The aim is to present an alternative conceptualization of <b>sustainable</b> <b>buildings</b> to the ecocommunities’ vision and to involve traditional building firms in their design and development. From a theoretical perspective, the mainstreaming of <b>sustainable</b> <b>buildings</b> can be seen either as an example of ecological modernization or technological transition. The new conceptualization has implied a narrower approach to sustainability and a lack of social sustainability measures. While earlier paradigms of <b>sustainable</b> <b>buildings</b> emphasized themes such as community building, self-provisioning, local empowerment, and shared facilities, such objectives are largely absent in the new types of <b>sustainable</b> <b>buildings.</b> We question to what extent it is possible to design sustainable settlements without social sustainability. By viewing <b>sustainable</b> <b>buildings</b> as technological configurations, we argue that the multiactor approach, fragmentation of roles, and absent initiatives for social sustainability influence the buildings’ environmental performance and should be important {{for the next generation of}} these structures...|$|R

25|$|Timber framing is now {{a modern}} method of construction, Ideally suited to mass house {{building}} as well as public buildings. In conjunction {{with a number of}} natural insulations and timber cladding or modern lime renders, it is possible to quickly construct a high performance, <b>sustainable</b> <b>building,</b> using completely natural products. The benefits are manythe building performs better over its lifespan, waste is reduced (much can be re-cycled, composted or used as fuel). Timber frame structures are frequently used in combination with other natural building techniques, such as cob, straw bale, or cordwood/masonry.|$|E

25|$|Net Zero Energy Building Certification {{launched}} in 2011, {{with an international}} following. The first project, Painters Hall, is Pringle Creek’s Community Center, café, office, art gallery, and event venue. Originally built in the 1930s, Painters Hall was renovated to LEED Platinum Net Zero energy building standards in 2010, demonstrating the potential of converting existing building stock into high‐performance, <b>sustainable</b> <b>building</b> sites. Painters Hall features simple low-‐cost solutions for energy reduction, such as natural daylighting and passive cooling lighting, that save money and increase comfort. A district ground-source geothermal loop serves the building’s GSHP for highly efficient heating and air conditioning. Excess generation from the 20.2kW rooftop solar array offsets pumping for the neighborhoods geo loop system.

25|$|Reducing water {{consumption}} and protecting water quality are key objectives in <b>sustainable</b> <b>building.</b> One critical issue of {{water consumption}} {{is that in}} many areas, the demands on the supplying aquifer exceed its ability to replenish itself. To the maximum extent feasible, facilities should increase their dependence on water that is collected, used, purified, and reused on-site. The protection and conservation of water throughout {{the life of a}} building may be accomplished by designing for dual plumbing that recycles water in toilet flushing or by using water for washing of the cars. Waste-water may be minimized by utilizing water conserving fixtures such as ultra-low flush toilets and low-flow shower heads. Bidets help eliminate the use of toilet paper, reducing sewer traffic and increasing possibilities of re-using water on-site. Point of use water treatment and heating improves both water quality and energy efficiency while reducing the amount of water in circulation. The use of non-sewage and greywater for on-site use such as site-irrigation will minimize demands on the local aquifer.|$|E
