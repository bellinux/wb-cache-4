40|$|Satellite {{data are}} being used to {{investigate}} problems in middle atmosphere chemistry and dynamics. Efforts have been focused primarily on studies to determine the quality of observed distributions of trace species and derived dynamical quantities. Those data have been used as diagnostics for model-derived constituent profiles and fields and for improving our understanding of some of the fundamental processes occurring in the middle atmosphere. Temperatures and derived winds from Nimbus 7 Limb Infrared Monitoring of the Stratosphere (LIMS) data were compared with long-time series of rawinsonde data at Invercargill, New Zealand, and Berlin, West Germany, and the results are excellent for both quantities. It was also demonstrated that more highly-derived dynamical quantities can be obtained reliably from those LIMS fields. Furthermore, both the diabatic and residual-mean circulations derived using LIMS data agree qualitatively with changes in the distribution of trace species determined independently with the Nimbus 7 SAMS and LIMS experiments. Subsequently, an examination of LIMS data at mid to high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere has revealed a synoptic-scale, upper stratospheric instability during late autumn that is associated with the development of the stratospheric polar jet.

40|$|Longitudinal {{inhomogeneity}} {{of total}} ozone distribution is investigated {{in association with}} dynamical variations in the troposphere and the stratosphere. First, {{in order to see}} the spatial correlation between the total ozone and dynamical fields we do a statistical analysis using 10 years of the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) total ozone data and the <b>Stratospheric</b> <b>Sounding</b> <b>Unit</b> (SSU) geopotential height and temperature data. Correlation coefficients between longitudinal anomalies of total ozone and lower stratospheric temperature are positive and significantly large in mid-and high latitudes, though the seasonality is much stronger for the planetary scale (wavenumbers 1 and 2) variations than for the synoptic scale (wavenumbers 4 to 6). Next, by using the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) ozone profile data, we do case studies to investigate where the main contribution to the wave structure in the total ozone field comes from. It is found in mid-and high latutudes that the synoptic disturbances in total ozone are mainly due to the variation of ozone around the bottom of the stratosphere and that the planetary scale disturbances are due to that over the lower stratosphere. During the spring in the southern hemisphere, however, there are some exceptional situations in which chemical reactions in the polar vortex decrease ozone in a thin layer of the lower stratosphere...|$|E
40|$|The 11 -yr {{solar cycle}} {{temperature}} response to spectrally resolved solar irradiance changes and associated ozone changes is calculated using a fixed dynamical heating (FDH) model. Imposed ozone changes are from satellite observations, {{in contrast to}} some earlier studies. A maximum of 1. 6 K {{is found in the}} equatorial upper stratosphere and a secondary maximum of 0. 4 K in the equatorial lower stratosphere, forming a double peak in the vertical. The upper maximum is primarily due to the irradiance changes while the lower maximum is due to the imposed ozone changes. The results compare well with analyses using the 40 -yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA- 40) and NCEP/NCAR datasets. The equatorial lower stratospheric structure is reproduced even though, by definition, the FDH calculations exclude dynamically driven temperature changes, suggesting an important role for an indirect dynamical effect through ozone redistribution. The results also suggest that differences between the <b>Stratospheric</b> <b>Sounding</b> <b>Unit</b> (SSU) /Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) and ERA- 40 estimates of the solar cycle signal {{can be explained by the}} poor vertical resolution of the SSU/MSU measurements.

40|$|Most global {{circulation}} models and climate-chemistry models forced with increasing greenhouse gases predict a {{strengthening of the}} Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC) in the twenty-first century, {{and some of them}} claim that such strengthening has already begun {{at the end of the}} twentieth century. However, observational evidence for such a trend remains inconclusive. The goal of this paper is to examine the evidence for observed trends in the stratospheric overturning circulation using a suite of currently available observational stratospheric temperature data. Trends are examined as ''departures'' from the global mean temperature, since such trends reflect the effects of dynamics and spatially inhomogeneous radiative forcing and are to first order independent of the direct radiative effects of increasing well-mixed greenhouse gas concentrations. The primary conclusion of the study is that temperature observations do not reveal statistically significant trends in the Brewer-Dobson circulation over the period from 1979 to the present, as covered by Microwave Sounding Unit and <b>Stratospheric</b> <b>Sounding</b> <b>Unit</b> temperatures. The estimated trends in the BDC are weak in all datasets and not statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. In many cases, different data products yield very different results, particularly when the trends are stratified by season. Implications for the interpretation of recent stratospheric climate change are discussed.

40|$|International audienceA {{comparison}} between NOAA- 16 Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) and lidar upper-stratospheric temperature measurements {{for the period}} from 2001 to 2007 for purposes of temperature monitoring is presented. Monthly means of lidar data from the Observatoire de Haute-Provence and AMSU data over Western Europe {{were found to have}} high correlation, particularly in winter months, when based on measurements for overlapping nights but lower correlation when different sets of days were used for the monthly mean calculation. This result implies that temperatures from lidar measurements are representative of an area relatively larger than its location, in a monthly mean timescale. However, the effect of temporal sampling arising from the fact that lidar measurements are only made in nights without visible cloud cover introduces discrepancies that propagate on the calculation of temperature tendencies. The estimated cooling rate based on lidar and AMSU data sets are in good agreement, although they are more negative than trends previously found based on the <b>Stratospheric</b> <b>Sounding</b> <b>Unit</b> data record from 1979 to 2005 for the middle-upper stratosphere.

The trajectories are quasi-isentropic in that a radiation scheme is used to simply cross-isentrope flow. The results show that in disturbed conditions, quantitative agreement the trajectories, that is, within 25 great circle degrees (GCD) (one GCD about 110 km) may be valid for only 3 or 4 days, whereas during quiescent periods, quantitative agreement may last up to 10 days. By comparing trajectories calculated with different data some insight can be gained as to errors due to vertical resolution and horizontal resolution (due to infrequent sampling) in the analyzed geopotential height fields. For the disturbed trajectories described in this paper the horizontal resolution of the data {{was more important than}} vertical resolution; however, for the quiescent trajectories, which could be calculated accurately for a longer duration because of the absence of appreciable transients, the vertical resolution of the data was found to be more important than the horizontal resolution.

The analysis reveals that the UAH TMT product has a positive bias of 0. 051 Â± 0. 031 in the warm target factor that artificially reduces the global TMT trend by 0. 042 K decade â 1 for 1979 â 2009. Accounting for this bias, we estimate that the global UAH TMT trend should increase from 0. 038 K decade â 1 to 0. 080 K decade â 1, effectively eliminating the trend difference between UAH and RSS and decreasing the trend difference between UAH and NOAA by 47 %.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that lower-stratosphere {{temperatures}} display a near-perfect cancellation between tropical and extratropical latitudes on both annual and interannual time scales. The out-of-phase relationship between tropical and high-latitude lower-stratospheric temperatures is a consequence of variability in the strength of the BrewerâDobson circulation (BDC). In this study, the signal of the BDC in stratospheric temperature variability is examined throughout the depth of the stratosphere using data from the <b>Stratospheric</b> <b>Sounding</b> <b>Unit</b> (SSU). While the BDC has a seemingly modest signal in the annual cycle in zonal-mean temperatures in the mid- and upper stratosphere, it has a pronounced signal in the month-to-month and interannual variability. Tropical and extratropical temperatures are significantly negatively correlated in all SSU channels on interannual time scales, suggesting that variations in wave driving are a major factor controlling global-scale temperature variability not only in the lower stratosphere (as shown in previous studies), but also in the mid- and upper stratosphere. The out-of-phase relationship between tropical and high latitudes peaks at all levels during the cold-season months: DecemberâMarch in the Northern Hemisphere and JulyâOctober in the Southern Hemisphere. In the upper stratosphere, the out-of-phase relationship with high-latitude temperatures extends beyond the tropics and well into the extratropics of the opposite hemisphere. The seasonal cycle in stratospheric temperatures follows the annual march of insolation at all levels and latitudes except in the mid- to upper tropical stratosphere, where it is dominated by the semiannual oscillation.

40|$|Studies {{have linked}} {{elements}} of the stratospheric circulation with particular localized features in the tropospheric circulation. This suggests {{a study of the}} response of the stratosphere to forcing by localized disturbances in the troposphere. A multilevel, primitive equation model is used of the stratosphere and mesosphere the height of whose lower boundary at 300 mb can be prescribed. Localized height disturbances which grow to steady amplitude are applied at this lower boundary, and the response of the initially axially symmetric stratosphere is studied. The perturbation, centered at 45 deg N, has a Gaussian distribution with a half width of 15 deg., corresponding roughly to the size of persistent troughs and blocking ridges in the troposphere. The forcing is nearly at fully amplitude 10 days after being switched on, and thereafter remains steady. Two types of experiments are conducted: in one the forcing is of small amplitude (100 gpm) and in the other it is of large amplitude (600 gpm). These pairs of experiments are compared to determine how nonlinear processes affect the perturbation fields. This is done locally by defining the perturbation response to the forcing as an anomaly, i. e., as a departure from the response in a controlled experiment in which no asymmetric forcing was applied at the lower boundary of the model. Experiments have been conducted for a number of atmospheric states obtained as zonal means of observations made by a <b>stratospheric</b> <b>sounding</b> <b>unit</b> (SSU).

Linear trends in an empirically derived âBDC indexâ (extratropical minus tropical temperatures), over 1979 â 2005, were found to be consistent with a significant strengthening of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) branch of the BDC during December throughout the depth of the stratosphere. Trends in the same index suggest a significant strengthening of the Southern Hemisphere branch of the BDC during August through to the midstratosphere, as well as a significant weakening during March in the NH lower stratosphere. Such trends, however, are only significant if it is assumed that interannual variability due to the BDC can be removed by regression of the tropics against the extratropics and vice versa (i. e., exploiting the out-of-phase nature of tropical and extratropical temperatures as demonstrated by previous studies of temperature and the BDC). The possibility that the apparent lower-stratosphere BDC December strengthening and March weakening could point to a change in the seasonal cycle of the circulation is also explored. The differences between a 1979 â 91 average and 1995 â 2005 average tropical temperature seasonal cycle in lower-stratospheric MSU data show an apparent shift in the minimum from February to January, consistent with a change in the timing of the maximum wave driving. Additionally, the importance of decadal variability in shaping the overall trends is highlighted, in particular for the suggested March BDC weakening, which may now be strengthening from a minimum in the 1990 s...|$|E
