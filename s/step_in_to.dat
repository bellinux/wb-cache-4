5|$|Smith asked Walls {{for details}} of his plan ("Operation Quartz") for using force to prevent ZANU-PF taking power by force if it lost the election. Walls insisted that ZANU-PF would not win the election. When it did happen, both Smith and Van der Byl {{believed}} that the Army should <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> prevent Mugabe taking over. Walls took the view that {{it was already too}} late, and while the others wished for some move, they were forced to concede to this view.|$|E

5|$|Freda's {{deal with}} his {{producers}} failed {{when he left the}} set on the twelfth day of production. After an argument with the producers, Freda left the production allowing Mario Bava to <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> finish the film in the next two days. Reasons for Freda leaving production differ, and range from Freda having a misunderstanding with the producers, to Bava stating that Freda was taking too long to make the film. Bava's ending was different than Freda's initial ending which involved finding the heroine hanged. Among the changes Bava made to finish the film, included changing the supporting character of the journalist becoming the lead and removing a sub-plot about a dismembered criminal who returns to life on being reassembled. Bava also extended other portions of the film with stock footage and montages of newspaper presses.|$|E
5|$|The Blade started {{publishing}} weekly in January 1983 and coverage {{shifted to the}} AIDS crisis and news about this newly emerging disease. The ever-breaking news caused the paper to remain in a heightened state of coverage and nearly exhausted the papers resources {{with members of the}} community having to <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> support the work of the Blade. The reporting of the AIDS crisis from this timeframe allowed the newspaper to come of age to the mature and professionally driven publication seen today. In June 1988, the editors of the paper used a computer to layout the paper for the first time. The 1990s saw increases in readership and circulation of the Washington Blade. In April 1993, during the 1993 Gay March on Washington, the paper published its largest edition to date consisting of 216 pages. The paper expanded into new markets and mediums with the 1995 launch of the online version of the Blade, followed two years later with the launching of a sister publication in New York, called the New York Blade. In the later part of the century, coverage was expanded to include local and national news, as well as international news of interest to the LGBT community.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} episode concerns mutilations {{that the}} combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes {{the eye is}} torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength. The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen Eye of Horus represents {{a wide variety of}} concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge {{in the form of the}} Eye and <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> mediate between the feuding deities.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, at a {{scheduled}} Juilliard production of La bohème directed by Michael Cacoyannis, conductor Thomas Schippers suddenly pulled out.

25|$|Early in 1991, {{for reasons}} {{that have not been}} clearly identified, the vessel sank at her moorings. The Clyde Ship Trust was placed in a {{position}} of embarrassment, for, being already in debt, it was unable to put forward the funds required for a major salvage operation. It became necessary for other organisations to <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> attempt to prevent the total loss of the ship.|$|E
25|$|The Métis had to {{stay close}} to the bison, which meant they were to move west of Red River. Places like Saint Joseph's in North Dakota became {{established}} winter places that the Métis would go to. Later, declining buffalo herds led to the Métis migrating farther and farther away. In the 1860s, living conditions, including crop conditions, were so severe that the Hudson's Bay Company had to <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> help avoid starvation.|$|E

25|$|Poirier was {{expected}} to face Erik Koch on February 4, 2012 at UFC 143. However, Koch {{pulled out of the}} bout citing an injury and was replaced by Ricardo Lamas. Then, just two weeks later, Lamas had to withdraw from the fight with an injury, leaving Poirier again without an opponent. A week later, Max Holloway agreed to <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> fight Poirier. Poirier defeated Holloway in the first round, with a triangle-armbar from the mount position.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{judicial}} review can be excluded through executive decision remains a live issue because the 1989 {{amendments to the}} ISA reverted the law on {{judicial review}} applicable to the ISA to the date that Lee Mau Seng was decided. However, Lee Mau Seng appears to be bad law since it was overruled by the Court of Appeal in Chng Suan Tze. Furthermore, as a High Court decision, Lee Mau Seng {{may not be the}} final word on judicial review of action taken under the ISA. In addition, if detainees allege procedural impropriety, this allows a court to consider if there are procedural defects in the Executive's decision-making process, such as the taking into account of irrelevant considerations. Finally, ouster clauses are not barriers to judicial review in modern administrative law because courts can still <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> prevent jurisdictional errors of law.|$|E
25|$|A {{program was}} {{initiated}} by Bletchley Park to design much faster bombes that could decrypt the four-rotor {{system in a}} reasonable time. There were two streams of development. One, code-named Cobra, with an electronic sensing unit, was produced by Charles Wynn-Williams of the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) at Malvern and Tommy Flowers of the General Post Office (GPO). The other, code-named Mammoth, was designed by Harold Keen at BTM, Letchworth. Initial delivery was scheduled for August or September 1942. The dual development projects created considerable {{tension between the two}} teams, both of which cast doubts on the viability of the opposing team's machine. After considerable internal rivalry and dispute, Gordon Welchman (by then, Bletchley Park's Assistant Director for mechanization) was forced to <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> resolve the situation. Ultimately, Cobra proved unreliable and Mammoth went into full-scale production.|$|E

25|$|In addition, the County of Tyrol and Duchy of Bavaria {{went to war}} in {{the late}} 15th century. Bavaria demanded money from Tyrol that had been loaned on the {{collateral}} of Tyrolean lands. In 1490, the two nations demanded that Maximilian I <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> mediate the dispute. In response, he assumed control of Tyrol and its debt. Because Tyrol had no law code at this time, the nobility freely expropriated money from the populace, which caused the royal palace in Innsbruck to fester with corruption. After taking control, Maximilian instituted immediate financial reform. In order to symbolize his new wealth and power, he built the Golden Roof, a canopy overlooking the town center of Innsbruck, from which to watch the festivities celebrating his assumption of rule over Tyrol. The canopy is made entirely from golden shingles. Gaining theoretical control of Tyrol for the Habsburgs was of strategic importance because it linked the Swiss Confederacy to the Habsburg-controlled Austrian lands, which facilitated some imperial geographic continuity.|$|E
25|$|Dan is {{introduced}} {{a few days}} into his new role as a consultant and is {{an old friend of}} registrar Greg Douglas (Edward MacLiam). He starts mentoring ward sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley), during her nurse consultant training. He has a hard time teaching her the importance of delegation in a consultant role. They become close and later start dating. Chrissie becomes stressed with the pressure of work, so Dan organises a trip abroad. He later realises she wants to relax, so he cancels and his relationship with Chrissie strengthens. The father of Chrissie's child, registrar Sacha Levy (Bob Barret) finds it hard to accept that Chrissie has moved on. The situation worsens when they have conflicting views on medicine. Dan decides to put his surgeon skills to the test when consultant Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) challenges him to complete his list of operations first. Feeling competitive, Dan rushes through an operation and makes an error. He gets Ric to <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> save the patient, with Ric taking the blame. Dan starts to feel like his relationship with Chrissie isn't going anywhere fast, so he invites her around to consummate their relationship. Chrissie is annoyed by Dan pressuring her, he tries to make things right again.|$|E
500|$|While {{the current}} law in Singapore {{holds that the}} Home Affairs Minister's {{decision}} is subjective and not judicially reviewable, there is uncertainty whether there are exceptional situations in which the courts may still <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> practice judicial review even though the ISA deals with national security matters. A possible exception is when the Minister's decision was made mala fides, that is, in bad faith. Such decisions would involve the clear abuse of power, such as being [...] "detained solely for having red hair or for failing a professional examination or for having acted as a lawyer against the Government".|$|E

[...] In November 2012, Zainab makes a promise never to interfere in people's lives, so AJ decides to use the opportunity to test her.

500|$|... "Vision of Love" [...] {{has been}} lauded by {{contemporary}} music critics for its lyrical content, vocals, {{and use of}} melisma. In a retrospective review on the album in 2005, Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "inspired" [...] and complimented Carey's use of the whistle register in the song. In 2006, Sasha Frere-Jones from The New Yorker named the song [...] "the Magna Carta of melisma" [...] for both the song's and Carey's influence on pop and R singers and American Idol contestants. Additionally, Rolling Stone said that [...] "the fluttering strings of notes that decorate songs like [...] "Vision of Love," [...] inspired the entire American Idol vocal school, for better or worse, and virtually every other female R singer since the nineties." [...] Slant Magazine critic Rich Juzwiak, wrote [...] "I think [...] was {{a vision of the}} future world of American Idol." [...] In a separate review from Slant, RJ wrote [...] "The last half of [...] "Vision Of Love" [...] (starting with the belted bridge) is a series of crescendos that get so intense that another Mariah has to <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> keep up the momentum." [...] Additionally, RJ complimented the usage of the whistle register in the song [...] "And then there's the whistle note. And then there's the final vocal run that's more like a roller-coaster track. If you think these aren't climaxes, she proves you wrong with her denouement, the way the last word, [...] "be," [...] sort of wanes into an [...] "mm hmm hmm." [...] Bill Lamb from About.com said that [...] "'Vision of Love' {{is one of the best}} songs of Mariah's recording career [...] It is simply one of the most stunning debut releases ever by a pop recording artist." ...|$|E
