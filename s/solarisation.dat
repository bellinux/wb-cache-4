25|$|Lady Isle {{is home to}} an {{interesting}} lighthouse. Established in 1903 the lighthouse is not the standard round tower type but rather consists of a platform built on buttresses with an exterior stairwell. The light is still used as a navigational aid (Fl(4)30s19m8M) and is managed by the Northern Lighthouse Board. An X/S Band racon radar beacon, with S Band emissions restricted to landward {{is also on the}} lighthouse. A small wooden storage hut sits beside the lighthouse, rather oddly inscribed Social Security Appeals Tribunal.

50|$|Early video synthesiser technologists {{concerned}} {{themselves with}} achieving arbitrary curves not limited by film chemistry. A {{goal was to}} extend the range of <b>solarisation</b> effects possible to a computer specified curve. They then applied the defined <b>solarisation</b> curve to real time video images. A video lookup table was often used to implement this. Using this enhanced <b>solarisation</b> technology, still photos could also be passed through a grey scale or colour lookup table with the advantage that the effect could be previewed and progressively improved, instead of a procedure based on darkroom exposure calculations applied on a one time basis to a volatile light sensitive film or print, as described above. This was an especial advantage for creating colour solarisations with 3 primary colours.|$|E
50|$|Since then, his {{personal}} photographic work {{was based upon}} experimentation with shadows and transparencies. He tried to use several emulsion techniques (<b>solarisations,</b> jets of developer).|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to solarise a negative and subsequently solarise the print made from that negative. The results of such double <b>solarisations</b> are rarely successful, usually producing muddy and poorly defined images.|$|R
5000|$|In Paris, {{she changed}} her first name Johanna into the French form, Jeanne. Like other modern photographers of the Weimar Republic, Mandello found {{inspiration}} during her exile in Paris. She {{was influenced by the}} Nouvelle Vision; by Man Ray, Brassaï and Doisneau, in redefined photography. They experimented with new techniques, unusual camera angles, picture cutouts, exposures and photomontages. Mandello and Grunbaum specialized in commercial and portrait photography and established themselves as fashion photographers. In 1937, they opened a studio in 17th Arrondissement under the name [...] "Mandello". [...] "Mandello" [...] did work for Fémina, Harper’s Bazaar and Vogue, as well as the fashion houses of Balenciaga, Guerlain, Maggy Rouff, and Creed. Occasionally, they worked with the photographer Hermann Landshoff, who had also fled Nazi Germany. After the outbreak of World War II, Mandello and her husband were considered Alien Enemies within the French Republic and were forced to leave Paris in early 1940. They had to leave everything behind: the photo studio, camera equipment, archived works and negatives. They were allowed to take only 14 kilos of luggage. They came to the village of Dognen where she helped out in the infirmary. Her German citizenship was withdrawn on 28 October 1940. With visas to Uruguay, Mandello and Grunebaum left France and started a new life in South America where she exhibited beginning in 1943. Her new work included architecture, landscapes, photograms, portraits, and <b>solarisations.</b> In 1952, she exhibited at Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro, and two years later, she separated from her husband, and moved to Brazil to be with the journalist, Lothar Bauer. With Bauer, she moved to Barcelona {{at the end of the}} decade where she worked the rest of her life. She married Bauer, and they adopted a daughter, Isabel, in 1970. Mandello died in Barcelona in 2001.|$|R
50|$|In colour photography, {{different}} coloured lights {{can be used}} {{to affect}} <b>solarisation,</b> but the results become even less predictable.|$|E
50|$|Initially, {{the term}} <b>solarisation</b> {{was used to}} {{describe}} the effect observed in cases of extreme overexposure of the negative in the camera. Most likely, the effect was first observed in scenery photographs including the sun (e.q. sol, sun). The sun, instead of being the whitest spot in the image, turned black or grey. Minor White's photograph of a winter scene, The Black Sun 1955, was a result of the shutter of his camera freezing in the open position, resulting in partial overexposure. Ansel Adams created an image titled Black Sun, Owens Valley, California (1939) by overexposure <b>solarisation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>solarisation</b> {{effect was}} already known to Daguerre {{and is one}} of the {{earliest}} known effects in photography. John William Draper was the first to call the overexposure effect <b>solarisation.</b> J.W.F. Herschel already observed the reversal of the image from negative to positive by extreme overexposure in 1840. L. Moser reported in 1843: [...] "...that the light in the camera obscura produces at first the well known negative image; with continued action of the light the image turns into a positive image.... and recently I have obtained in fact on occasion a third image which is negative".|$|E
50|$|Light fogging on a print {{usually only}} occurs {{because of poor}} control of {{lighting}} in the darkroom and {{is seen as an}} overall dark veil across the print or, occasionally, as unintended <b>solarisation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Careful {{choice of}} the amount of light used and the precise moment in {{development}} to provide the additional exposure gives rise to different outcomes. However, <b>solarisation</b> is very difficult to manage to yield consistent results.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1950s, {{he resumed}} his {{previous}} activities and again began experimenting {{with the camera}} and photographic techniques. [...] He created so-called [...] "prizmata" [...] (prisms), photographs taken through a birefringent prism. Additionally, he experimented with <b>solarisation</b> and explored the possibilities of the Sabatier effect.|$|E
50|$|Graphs {{describing}} <b>solarisation</b> curves typically place {{input range}} of tones on the x axis, with black at 0 and white to the right, and the output {{range of tones}} on the y axis with black at 0 and white up. A curve then defines the input to output mapping.|$|E
50|$|Grindat {{was one of}} the few Swiss photographers of {{her time}} to develop an artistic {{approach}} to photography. Her complex surrealistic images were often achieved by means of collage, photograms, or <b>solarisation.</b> Influenced by Camus, she took a keen interest in photographing towns and landscapes next to the sea, fascinated by the effects of light and water.|$|E
50|$|Pseudo-solarisation (or pseudo-solarization) is a {{phenomenon}} in photography in which the image recorded on a negative or on a photographic print is wholly or partially reversed in tone. Dark areas appear light or light areas appear dark. The term is synonymous with the Sabatier effect when referring to negatives. <b>Solarisation</b> and pseudo-solarisation are quite distinct effects.|$|E
50|$|Control of {{existing}} Phytophthora infestations includes injecting or spraying plants with phosphite (a fungicide), using well-composted mulch, and using pre-planting {{techniques such as}} <b>solarisation</b> or biofumigation. Composted mulch is highly suppressive to phytophthora dieback and can prevent healthy plants getting infected. It is most important {{to prevent the spread}} of infected soil, plants or water. Infested areas can be revegetated or landscaped with resistant plant species which are not affected by the disease.|$|E
50|$|Live '91 was {{recorded}} at Raji's in Hollywood and released through Triple X Records. The photograph {{used for the}} cover, taken by Edward Colver a decade earlier, {{is the same one}} used for the band's 1981 debut EP, but given a sepia tone rather than the high-contrast <b>solarisation</b> treatment used for the EP. Because they did not have the rights to use the name T.S.O.L., the band's name does not appear on the album packaging. Instead, it bears the four members' full names.|$|E
50|$|The film's release {{also was}} delayed (partly {{because of the}} use of <b>solarisation,</b> a then-new {{technique}} both laborious and expensive) and badly under-promoted. The sole television commercial was a confusing minimalist close-up shot of a man's head (John Brockman); after 30 seconds the man smiled and the name HEAD appeared on his forehead. This ad was a parody of Andy Warhol's 1963 film Blow Job, which only showed a close-up of a man's face for an extended period, supposedly receiving 'head'.|$|E
50|$|Her {{move from}} Frankfurt to the burgeoning avant-garde and surrealist scene in Paris in 1930 marked {{the start of}} the most notable period of her career. She {{produced}} images in the fields of photojournalism, architectural photography, advertising and fashion, and her work was published in magazines such as Le Monde Illustre, Harper's Bazaar, and Vogue. Respected for her use of daring perspectives, unconventional cropping, use of natural light, and geometries, she also discovered a type of <b>solarisation</b> for negatives independently of a similar process developed by the artist Man Ray.|$|E
50|$|To {{achieve this}} effect, {{a black and}} white film {{negative}} was first processed with <b>solarisation</b> (a process which partially reverses the negative making some areas of the image appear positive). The resulting film was then tinted red. Making a film positive was not necessary. At the time The Angry Red Planet was produced, black and white film cost less than color film and processing. The combination of using black and white film for all scenes depicting Mars and not needing to produce a film positive lowered production costs for the film.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a further}} {{characteristic}} effect: a narrow band or rim of low density, called the Mackie line, is formed at the boundaries between adjacent highlight and shadow areas. If the film negative is treated, the line is light, which produces a dark line in the print; when the print itself is processed it produces a white or light line around areas of high contrast. It is therefore always possible {{to determine whether the}} negative or print has been used to produce the <b>solarisation</b> effect. However, researchers have shown that Mackie lines {{are not part of the}} Sabatier effect itself.|$|E

50|$|Titarenko's {{prints are}} {{created in the}} {{darkroom}} by photographer himself, sources called him {{a master of the}} darkroom technic. Selective bleaching and toning (often done by brush) add depth to his palette of grays. Like Man Ray and Maurice Tabard, Titarenko uses <b>solarisation,</b> but unlike his predecessors, he exposes the print to light during the developing process mostly at the edges and in such a subtle way that it only lowers the contrast and creates a very particular kind of gray silver 'veil'. Nonetheless, in order to emphasize the dramatic aspects of the City of Shadows series, he sometimes uses the Sabattier effect called the Mackie line.|$|E
5000|$|Plots of {{film density}} (log of opacity) versus the log of {{exposure}} are called characteristic curves, Hurter-Driffield curves, H-D curves, HD curves, H & D curves, D-logE curves, or D-logH curves. At moderate exposures, the overall shape is typically {{a bit like}} an [...] "S" [...] slanted so that its base and top are horizontal. There is usually a central region of the HD curve which approximates to a straight line, called the [...] "linear" [...] or [...] "straight-line" [...] portion; the slope of this region is called the gamma. The low end is called the [...] "toe", and at the top, the curve rounds over to form the [...] "shoulder". At extremely high exposures, the density may come back down, an effect known as <b>solarisation.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{potassium}} dichromate solution in sulfuric acid {{can be used}} to produce a reversal negative (i.e., a positive transparency from a negative film). This is effected by developing a black and white film but allowing the development to proceed more or less to the end point. The development is then stopped by copious washing and the film then treated in the acid dichromate solution. This converts the silver metal to silver sulfate, a compound that is insensitive to light. After thorough washing and exposure to actinic light, the film is developed again allowing the previously unexposed silver halide to be reduced to silver metal.The results obtained can be unpredictable, but sometimes excellent results are obtained producing images that would otherwise be unobtainable. This process can be coupled with <b>solarisation</b> so that the end product resembles a negative and is suitable for printing in the normal way.|$|E
50|$|Gertrude Fehr (1895 - 1996) was a German photographer. She studied {{photography}} {{in the workshop}} of Edward Wasow, and at the Bavarian School.

5000|$|In 1929, Miller {{traveled}} to Paris {{with the intention}} of apprenticing herself to the surrealist artist and photographer Man Ray. Although, at first, he insisted that he did not take students, Miller soon became his model and collaborator (announcing to him, [...] "I'm your new student"), as well as his lover and muse. While she was in Paris, she began her own photographic studio, often taking over Man Ray's fashion assignments to enable him to concentrate on his painting. In fact, many of the photographs taken during this period and credited to Man Ray were actually taken by Miller. Together with Man Ray, she rediscovered the photographic technique of <b>solarisation.</b> She was an active participant in the surrealist movement, with her witty and humorous images. Amongst her circle of friends were Pablo Picasso, Paul Éluard, and Jean Cocteau, who was so mesmerized by Miller's beauty that he coated her in butter and transformed her into a plaster cast of a classical statue for his film, The Blood of a Poet (1930)). During a dispute with lover Man Ray, regarding the attribution of their co-produced work, Man Ray is said to have slashed an image of Miller's neck with a razor.|$|E
5000|$|... 1. beginnings: Photography, multi-vision and {{painting}} 1965- 1969 During these early years, Helmut Tollmann was experiencing {{a lot of}} photographical techniques and chemical procedures. He had won in these early times more than 25 national and international awards, that can be proved by press and certificates. The historic material of these years is not even regrounded. But as you can see, the most of all the procedures Helmut Tollmann is using until today in his artistic work, posterisation, lithographic films and developers, <b>solarisation</b> and reprographic use of photographic techniques {{can be found in}} his works until now, especially in his multi-layer-technique. [...] 2. new ways and techniques 1970-1974 Beginning in the early seventies Helmut Tollmann was principally involved in paintings of architecture and landscapes, deeply impressed by the work of Max Ernst. The proximity of Helmut Tollmann’s early paintings to Max Ernst is no coincidence. Max Ernst invented a lot of procedures and techniques in modern painting (the frottage, for example) and so did Helmut Tollmann. Always looking for new media and procedures useful for artistic utilization. In this period he painted his so-called “soft landscapes”. They look like silk paintings. Helmut Tollmann’s artistic expression based on the study of Max Ernst. And so did the architectural paintings too. [...] 3. Bringing painting, reprography and printing technique together 1974-1985 In these days Helmut Tollmann and a lot his friends (for example Andy Warhol) and colleagues were using reprographic and photographic techniques, especially in Pop-Art. But Helmut Tollmann tried something one can estimate maybe not before today. He brought the squeegee from silk screen printing into painting years before others. In these paintings you can also find elements of technical and electronic processes, which go together more and more with his art the coming years. [...] 4. Technology and the soul in world and mankind - “Soul of Chip” 1985-1997 The painting media were changing more and more. Using new colors and the canvas of his work is changing to copper plates, printed circuit boards and so on. All corresponding to the main theme in Helmut Tollmann’s works of that time “soul of chip”, a registered trade mark of Helmut Tollmann until today. How does the world of information and the men in it rock? Portraits of local, national and international status such as Trude Herr a local hero of Cologne theater or Albert Einstein join in Helmut Tollmann’s artistic work of these days. Multimedia, illumination and information technology mixed in multi-layer artwork. [...] 5. Links - the connecting aspect between technology and mankind 1998-2007 In this shift of emphasis from searching for the “soul of chip” to the use of media the new theme in Helmut Tollmann’s work was showing up: Links. The chance to join apparently disparate projects like: Wirkbetrieb 1, a projects of T-Systems and “Together” a project of the initiative tolerance under the patronage of Joschka Fischer former minister of foreign affairs. In this time new portraits of people from the music history (Beethoven-Superstar, Wagner, Berlioz…) and the social, political and economical life were painted. [...] 6. Cosmic elements and cosmic prayer- 2008-today Helmut Tollmann is reprocessing the globalized world in its elements. multiple layers in the projection on and in buildings or on a water shield. As in the very beginning Helmut Tollmann is returning to the combination of exhibition and multimedia show. The light as a painting tool used by “the master of color” as the gallery owner, art dealer and artist Markus Roubrocks once said. With extremely high powered projectors Helmut Tollmann showed just one long time running artwork, that surrounded the people in the church of the lords heart at Singen/Bodensee und two years later on the Hegau-Tower. In Lyon a single artworks showed by Helmut Tollmann on all all the six-story-buildings enclosing the main market place. His paintings as layer of light in the real world.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} compost {{addition}} and simulated <b>solarisation</b> of soil on {{the survival of}} Ralstonia solanacearum biovar 2 strain 1609, {{as well as on}} the structure of indigenous soil bacterial communities, were analysed. In addition, effects on the invasion of susceptible test plants by strain 1609 were assessed. In untreated soil in microcosms and the field, strain 1609 showed slow progressive declines, from 106 - 107 to roughly 104 - 105 CFU per g dry soil in around 60 days. When these soils were used in suppressiveness tests, a majority of plants developed symptoms of wilting and revealed the presence of the pathogen in their lower stem parts, as evidenced by immunofluorescence colony staining (IFC) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). <b>Solarisation</b> of unamended soil did not drastically affect R. solanacearum survival or plant invasiveness. However, the addition of household compost resulted in enhanced R. solanacearum population decline rates, as well as reduced numbers of diseased plants in suppressiveness tests. Combined <b>solarisation</b> and compost addition yielded differential results between microcosms and the field. Some healthy-looking plants, primarily from soils treated with compost, revealed the latent presence of strain 1609 in the lower stem parts. The eubacterial and -subgroup proteobacterial communities in the differentially treated soil microcosms were rather stable, as evidenced by analysis of PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) generated molecular profiles. However, compost amendment clearly induced changes in these communities, which were detectable until the end of the experiment; two major bands, affiliated with Variovorax paradoxus and Aquaspirillum psychrophylum, were associated with the compost amendment. The decrease in abundance of R. solanacearum in the compost-amended soils was confirmed by the DGGE profiles...|$|E

This paper assesses solar hybridisation of boiler based steam power plants, whichpreheat boiler combustion air with a novel high temperature CST system based on a solid particle receiver (SPR). This new method of preheating {{has the potential to}} increase the solar share of the overall system, improve fuel saving and therefore produce a higher solar to electric conversion efficiency. These benefits result from theSPR solar systems higher operating temperature and integrated thermal storage. The integrated thermal storage also allows a buffered response time for handling transients in the intermittent solar resource. Analysis indicates that air-solarisation of coal plants can result in significantly higher solar to electric conversion efficiency than existing solar hybridisation options. <b>Solarisation</b> by TBS decreases power cycle efficiency due to bleed steam reduction, while <b>solarisation</b> by air-preheating increases the power system efficiency, primarily due to enhanced boiler efficiency brought about by reduced stack losses.

The comparison was conducted by modelling both systems and analysing the thermodynamic heat and mass balance of the steam cycle and boiler using EBSILON®Professional software. Annual simulation tools, which calculate the performance of the solar field, receiver, storage (when applicable) and other system components, were used to model the output of the solar technologies. These tools, coupled with available economic data and cost models for the newly developed solar components, were used to calculate the levelized cost of energy of the compared hybridisation options.
