25|$|The {{first two}} {{locomotives}} (St David's and St George) were scrapped {{about the end}} of the nineteenth century, and two new engines were acquired from Andrew Barclay, Sons & Co of Kilmarnock: they were named Fordell, arrived in 1901, and Lord Hobart in 1912.

50|$|The {{chassis frame}} has an {{underframe}} {{designed to make}} {{a unit of the}} engine and gearbox both of which are supported by it along the full length of both their sides. Suspension is by semi-elliptic springs all round. At the rear universal-jointed radius rods tie the rear-axle casing to the chassis frame. A triangular torque rod held at its front end by a <b>spring</b> <b>buffer</b> resists the reaction of driving and braking. Internal expanding brakes are fitted to the rear wheels together with an external hinged shoe brake behind the gear box.|$|E
50|$|The AM-23 {{differs from}} the ZSU {{anti-aircraft}} cannon in having a gas buffer where the ZSU has a disk <b>spring</b> <b>buffer.</b> The propellant gas conducted into the buffer is used to soften {{the impact of the}} actuating slide when it reaches the back plate. The compressed gas inside the buffer is then used to impart a considerable forward velocity to the actuating slide to start counter-recoil. Ammunition may be fed from either the left or from the right side. Fired cartridge cases are ejected through a port {{on the underside of the}} receiver and empty belt links drop out of the feed mechanism at the opposite side from which the belt was fed. A pneumatic charging mechanism is used to charge the cannon and to clear misfires.|$|E
50|$|The ZB-26 was a gas-operated, air-cooled, {{selectively}} fired, machine gun. It has a finned, quick-detachable {{barrel and}} fires {{from an open}} bolt. Its action {{is powered by a}} long-stroke gas piston, located below the barrel. The gas block is mounted at the muzzle end of the barrel and also serves as the front sight base. The action is locked by tipping the rear of the bolt (breechblock) upwards, and into a locking recess in the receiver. The return spring is located in the butt of the weapon, and is connected to the bolt carrier/gas piston via a long rod; additionally, there is a short <b>spring</b> <b>buffer</b> located around the return spring at the juncture of the receiver and butt, which softensthe impact of the bolt group {{at the end of its}} rearward stroke.|$|E
25|$|Lima was an Italian {{company that}} was a popular, {{affordable}} supplier of model railway material but market pressures in the mid-1990s led to Lima merging with Rivarossi, Arnold, and Jouef. When these consolidations failed and operations ceased in 2004, Hornby Railways acquired Lima's assets. As of mid 2006, a range of these products has been made available under the Hornby International brand, refitted with NEM couplings and <b>sprung</b> <b>buffers</b> and sockets for DCC decoders. Lima also had a popular OO gauge range much like Hornby, which strengthened the case for acquisition.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicles}} are coupled by hand using a hook and links with a turnbuckle that draws the vehicles together. In Britain, {{this is called}} a screw coupling. Vehicles have buffers, one at each corner on the ends, which are pulled together and compressed by the coupling device. This arrangement limits the slack in trains and lessens shunting shocks. By contrast, the semi-automatic Janney coupler usually requires comparatively jarring encounters in order to engage the coupling fully. The earliest buffers were fixed extensions of the wagon frames, but later <b>spring</b> <b>buffers</b> were introduced.|$|R
50|$|Hornby Railways offered €8 {{million to}} acquire Lima's assets (including tooling, inventory, {{and the various}} brand names) in March of the same year, the Italian {{bankruptcy}} court of Brescia, last headquarters of Lima) approving the offer later that year. In December 2004, Hornby Railways formally announced the acquisition along with the Rivarossi (H0 North American and Italian prototypes), Arnold (N scale European prototypes), Jouef (H0 scale French prototypes), and Pocher (die-cast metal automobile kits) ranges.

50|$|The A-12.7 {{machine gun}} is a gas-operated weapon with a {{vertically}} moving wedge breechblock. On the actuating slide two pivoting, jointed chambering levers are mounted. Those chambering levers actually work like {{the arms of}} a praying mantis. The upper, longer lever is used to ram the cartridge from the belt link into the chamber. An extraction claw on its forward end is used to extract the fired cartridge case. The lower lever protrudes into the weapon housing and has a U-shaped recess on its lower end. As the actuating slide moves back and forth, a traverse lug in the weapon housing is cammed into this recess to guide the chambering levers. The A-12.7 aircraft machine gun has an electrical sear mechanism that is operated by a voltage of 26V. At the back plate a <b>spring</b> <b>buffer</b> is located. Ammunition may be fed from either the left or from the right side. A pneumatically operated charging mechanism {{on the left side of}} the receiver is used to charge the machine gun and to clear misfires. The cylindrical housing on the right side of the receiver contains the return spring of the actuating slide.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} at Sheffield in Flavell's Yard, Fargate, on 6 December 1816.He was the second son of Samuel Brown, a slater of that town. He was educated at a local school held in a garret, and was apprenticed {{at the age of}} {{fourteen}} to Earl, Horton, & Co., factors, of Orchard Place, In 1831, his employers engaged in the manufacture of files and table cutlery, taking an establishment in Rockingham Street, which they styled the Hallamshire Works. Nonetheless he did take over the company's factoring business {{with the help of a}} loan for £500 thanks to the backing of his father and uncle and for several years travelled the country selling goods.He started his own company John Brown & company in 1844 manufacturing Steel at a small foundry on a site at what is the now Orchard Square Shopping centre. The business prospered so well that he sold his factoring firm and moved to larger premises on Furnival Street. In 1848 Brown invented the conical steel <b>spring</b> <b>buffer</b> for railway carriages which he sold to the London and North Western Railway as well as other railways throughout the UK. On 1 January 1856, Brown opened his new Atlas Works in Brightside in an effort to centralise his workshops and workforce in one place, the works originally were on a 3 acre site but within three years had grown to 30 acre. By 1859 Brown was producing rails for the quickly expanding railway industry using the Bessemer process. Brown's great achievement was the development of armour plating for war vessels. In 1860, he saw at Toulon the French ship La Gloire. She was a timber-built 90-gun three-decker, cut down and coated with hammered plate armour, four and a half inches thick. This contrivance occasioned the English government so much uneasiness that they ordered ten 90- and 100-gun vessels to be similarly adapted. Brown, from a distant inspection of La Gloire, came to the conclusion that the armoured plates used in protecting her might have been rolled instead of hammered. He was at that time mayor of Sheffield, and he invited the premier, Lord Palmerston, to inspect the process. Palmerston's visit was followed in April 1863 by one from the lords of the admiralty, who saw rolled a plate twelve inches thick and fifteen to twenty feet long. The latter visit was the subject of an article in Punch (18 April 1863). The admiralty were convinced of the merits of Brown's methods, and the royal commission on armour plates ordered from his works nearly all the plates they required. In a few years, he had sheathed fully three-fourths of the British navy. In 1856, he concentrated in Saville Street, Sheffield, the different manufactures in which he had been engaged in various parts of the town. His establishment, styled the Atlas Works, covered nearly thirty acres, and increased until it gave employment to over four thousand artisans. He undertook the manufacture of armour plates, ordnance forgings, railway bars, steel springs, buffers, tires, and axles, supplied Sheffield with iron for steel-making purposes, and was the first successfully to develop the Bessemer process, and to introduce into Sheffield the manufacture of steel rails. He received frequent applications from foreign governments for armour plates, but invariably declined such contracts unless the consent of the home government was obtained. During the civil war in America he refused large orders from the northern states. In 1864, his business was converted into a limited liability company, and he retired to Endfield Hall, Ranmoor, near Sheffield. He was Mayor of Sheffield in 1862 and 1863, and master cutler in 1865 and 1866, and was knighted in 1867.In 1865 he had Endcliffe Hall built as his private residence, this was and still is the largest private house ever built in Sheffield.In 1902, Sheffield steelmakers John Brown & Company exchanged shares and came to a working agreement with neighbouring company Thomas Firth & Sons, the companies continuing under their own management until they finally merged in 1930 Forming Firth Brown Ltd.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{the process}} of fire of rapid firing rate 30 mm guns, {{it was not only}} {{difficult}} to guarantee firing accuracy and mobility but also had high requirements on the carriage strength because of large recoil force, therefore this design provided a scheme about hydraulic <b>spring</b> <b>buffer</b> mechanism to reduce recoil force. In view of the determined buffer mechanism scheme, the dynamics model of gun was established with the effect of buffer mechanism. Parameters of buffer mechanism were obtained by calculation. Then analysis of the recoil mechanism was carried out.

50|$|Swedish company Interdynamic AB of Stockholm {{designed}} the Interdynamic MP-9 9mm submachine gun. Interdynamic intended {{it as an}} inexpensive submachine gun based on the Carl Gustav M/45 for military applications, but did not find a government buyer, so it {{was taken to the}} US market as an open-bolt semi-automatic pistol. The open-bolt design was deemed too easy to convert to full auto. Because of this, the ATF forced Interdynamic to redesign it into a closed-bolt system, which was harder to convert to full auto. This variant was called the KG-99. It made frequent appearances on Miami Vice, where it was legally converted to full auto by Title II manufacturers. The KG-9 and KG-99 have an open-end upper receiver tube where the bolt, recoil <b>springs,</b> and <b>buffer</b> plate are held in place by the plastic/polymer lower receiver frame. This design only allows for 115 grain 9mm ammunition. If heavier grain ammunition or hot loads are used, the plastic lower receiver will fail or crack, rendering the firearm unusable. The later model TEC-9 and AB-10 have a threaded upper receiver tube at the rear and a screw-on end cap to contain the bolt, recoil <b>spring,</b> and <b>buffer</b> plate even if removed from the lower receiver. This solves the problem of lower receiver failure when using hot ammo.|$|R

50|$|Experience {{proved that}} a train of seven {{compartments}} {{was the longest}} that could be controlled. While {{it was possible to}} push ten or eleven compartments, they became difficult to steer when empty, and particularly if it was windy. In the 1870s, the number of compartments was increased to four trains of seven per tug, but as the numbers available increased, the concept of a fixed train gave way to the compartments being considered individually, and a train could be made up from any that were available. The tugs had a water tank near the bow, which could be filled or emptied to alter the angle of the tug depending on whether it was pushing a train of full or empty compartments. When Bartholomew presented evidence to the Select Committee On Canals in 1883, he indicated that trains often exceeded 11 compartments, and that in this configuration, the tug pulled the compartments. At the time, many trains consisted of 11 or 12 compartments, but trains of 22 were quite frequent, and up to 30 had been tried. <b>Spring</b> <b>buffers</b> had been added between the compartments, to assist the straightening of the boat after it had negotiated a bend in the canal. The navigation company hoped to extend the locks by another 250 ft to allow the longer trains to pass without having to split them, but {{there is no evidence that}} this programme was carried out, as the normal length of a train was still 10 or 11 compartments in 1904.|$|R
