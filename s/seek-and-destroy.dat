5|$|The game {{features}} {{five different}} terrain settings with each level being {{played on a}} large map divided into several missions. These missions include <b>seek-and-destroy,</b> search-and-rescue, escorts, the destruction of bridges, supply drops and air support. In some sections the player forms part of a coordinated attack with AI-controlled allies, while in others the player directs ground troops {{in the style of}} a real-time strategy game. As well as engaging in combat, the player must monitor and replenish his fuel and ammunition supplies. The heads-up display shows this information, along with intelligence on missions objectives and on friendly and enemy units and their locations. The compass indicating mission objectives is a feature new to Nuclear Strike, as is a radar showing the positions of nearby enemies.|$|E

Small games developers such as Tamsoft, BHE, E-game and KID corp, were sometimes omitted from the credits on a game's Takara packaging or title screens.|$|E

5000|$|Marlo Smefner - Thrasher said [...] "Of Space Moose's cohorts, Marlo is {{probably}} the most normal" [...] and [...] "Having had somewhat of a moral upbringing, Marlo does not agree with Space's <b>seek-and-destroy</b> philosophy of life, and tries to curb the antlered one's nihilistic ventures whenever possible. Despite the animosity between them, Space Moose cannot help but see a little of himself in Marlo." [...] Thrasher introduced Marlo in 1994. At first Thrasher intended for Marlo to be a one-time character, but then he realized that he could act as the comic's straight man. Several commentators asked Thrasher whether Marlo is supposed to represent him. Cosh explained [...] "This may be because Adam often disavows Space Moose's own outlook on life." [...] Thrasher responded that Marlo is not an avatar of himself.|$|E
50|$|PHM Pegasus assigns {{players to}} the control of three {{different}} types of vehicles: Patrol Hydrofoil Missilecrafts (PHM), Seasprite and Seahawk helicopters, and convoy ships. The first two missions are time-limited where the player controls a PHM and must find nearby enemy crafts using the ship's 40-mile radius radar and sink them using the ship's array of weaponry. Players can fire from a manual maneuvering screen or use {{a pair of binoculars}} to identify and aim at ships. Two missions are <b>seek-and-destroy</b> where the player can use two helicopters to locate enemy ships in the Mediterranean and sink them using the PHM. Another mission involves surveillance where players must navigate within 1500 feet of eight tankers suspected of carrying arms to photograph the vessels. The mission does not allow the tankers to be fired upon, so two SeaHawk helicopters must be used to scout the area before approach.|$|E
5000|$|The {{battleship}} {{war in the}} Atlantic {{was driven}} by the attempts of German capital ship commerce raiders - two battleships, the [...] and the , and two battlecruisers - to influence the Battle of the Atlantic by destroying Atlantic convoys supplying the United Kingdom. The superior numbers of British surface units devoted themselves to protecting the convoys, and to <b>seek-and-destroy</b> missions against the German ships, assisted by both naval and land-based aircraft and by sabotage attacks. On 24 May 1941, during its attempt to break out into the North Atlantic, the commerce raider Bismarck engaged the British battleship [...] and the battlecruiser [...] Due primarily to the Bismarcks superior range-finding and accuracy, it soon sank Hood with an apparent hit to her magazines. Bismarck and Prince of Wales hit each other three times, the damage compelling the Prince of Wales to withdraw and the Bismarck to call off its commerce raiding operation, {{as part of its}} fuel reserve had been contaminated with salt water. While the Bismarck was heading for St. Nazaire, the Royal Navy continued to hunt it, and eventually an attack by Swordfish biplane torpedo bombers from the aircraft carrier [...] disabled Bismarcks rudder and significantly reduced her speed. This enabled two Royal Navy battleships, cruisers and destroyers to close in for the kill.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Synthetic Biology {{is a field}} {{involving}} {{synthesis of}} novel biological systems which are not generally found in nature. It has brought a new paradigm in science as it has enabled scientists to create life from the scratch, hence helping better understand the principles of biology. The viability of living organisms that use unnatural molecules is also being explored. Unconventional projects such as DNA playing tic-tac-toe, bacterial photographic film, etc. are taking biology to its extremes. The field holds a promise for mass production of cheap drugs and programming bacteria to <b>seek-and-destroy</b> tumors in the body. However, the complexity of biological systems make the field a challenging one. In addition to this, there are other major technical and ethical challenges which {{need to be addressed}} before the field realizes its true potential...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{develop a}} {{surveillance}} support model that enables prediction of areas susceptible to invasion, comparative analysis of surveillance methods and intensity {{and assessment of}} eradication feasibility. To apply the model to identify surveillance protocols for generalized invasion scenarios and for evaluating surveillance and control for a context-specific plant invasion. Location: Australia. Methods: We integrate a spatially explicit simulation model, including plant demography and dispersal vectors, within a Geographical Information System. We use the model to identify effective surveillance protocols using simulations of generalized plant life-forms spreading via different dispersal mechanisms in real landscapes. We then parameterize the surveillance support model for Chilean needle grass [CNG; Nassella neesiana (Trin. & Rupr.) Barkworth], a highly invasive tussock grass, which is an eradication target in south-eastern Queensland, Australia. Results: General surveillance protocols that can guide rapid response surveillance were identified; suitable habitat that is susceptible to invasion through particular dispersal syndromes should be targeted for surveillance using an adaptive <b>seek-and-destroy</b> method. The search radius of the adaptive method {{should be based on}} maximum expected dispersal distances. Protocols were used to define a surveillance strategy for CNG, but simulations indicated that despite effective and targeted surveillance, eradication is implausible at current intensities. Main conclusions: Several important surveillance protocols emerged and simulations indicated that effectiveness can be increased if they are followed in rapid response surveillance. If sufficient data are available, the surveillance support model should be parameterized to target areas susceptible to invasion and determine whether surveillance is effective and eradication is feasible. We discovered that for CNG, regardless of a carefully designed surveillance strategy, eradication is implausible at current intensities of surveillance and control and these efforts should be doubled {{if they are to be}} successful. This is crucial information in the face of environmentally and economically damaging invasive species and large, expensive and potentially ineffective control programmes...|$|E
