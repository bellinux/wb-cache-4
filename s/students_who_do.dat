40|$|This study {{considered}} high-quality preschool programs, {{what has}} happened in Kentucky preschool programs and the long-term effects children receive from attending a preschool program. Research indicated that there are significant long-term attendant benefits: better school achievement, better school attainment, and better adult success. This research used the 2004 senior class of Logan County Schools in Russellville, Kentucky and examined the rate of special education placement, retention, suspension and dropout for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> attended a preschool program versus <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> not attend a preschool program.

30|$|We {{begin our}} {{analysis}} by providing raw counts of failure {{rates for the}} <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and did not receive LA support in STEM gateway courses. Next, we describe the differences between those <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and did not receive LA support with respect to available covariates. If {{it is the case}} that we see large differences in our covariates between the group of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> and did not receive LA support, we expect that controlling for those factors in the regression analysis will affect our results in meaningful ways. Thus, we close with estimating logistic regression models to disentangle some of the relationship between LA-support and course failure. The variable of most interest in this analysis is the indicator for exposure to the LA program. A student received a “ 1 ” for this variable if they were exposed to the LA program either concurrently or prior to taking STEM gateway courses, and a 0 if they took any classes in the study but never had any LA support in those classes.|$|R

These students are referred to the Student Support Team (SST) for review. This leads to a parent-teacher-student conference attended by both the counselor and the principal.

25|$|Government TVETs are {{particularly}} concerned with occupations requiring investment in {{machinery and equipment}} and with increasing provision in remote areas. Workshop provision varies in quality. Some TVETs have good provision but many others have a shortage of workshops or old dilapidated workshops that lack safety features, basic sanitary facilities and essential equipment. Classrooms, stores and libraries may be in poor condition or non-existent. Instructors may lack competence since, in 2012, only 53% of those assessed met the assessment criteria. Even when TVETs have machinery and equipment, {{there are too many}} students for the few resources available. Students cannot meet the 70% to 80% requirement for practice and training remains theory based. Consequently, students have difficulty in meeting the assessment criteria with only 23% of students being found competent in 2012. <b>Students</b> <b>who</b> <b>do</b> graduate may still find it hard to get work. The Amhara TVET promotion bureau found only about 40% of TVET graduates managed to obtain employment.|$|E
