From the starting point of analysing the principle of fire-proof sealing and {{plugging in}} building and analysing some key influence factors, this paper originally proposes the composite applications of fire-proof <b>sealing</b> <b>technical</b> measures, on the basis of combining the engineering application. Then taking the new fire-proof sealing sheet for representative example, it introduces the current situation of fire-proof sealing product and gives reasons analysis. At last, it brings up corresponding suggestions from four aspects: the product quality, product standard, product selection and construction application, trying to provide some new thoughts and methods for solving fire-proof sealing and plugging problem...|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyOne {{form for}} {{artificial}} lift {{that has been}} used for decades is Electric Submersible Pumps (ESP). Since the birth of ESP in 1926 has the technology evolved slowly and ESP used today has a lot of similarities with the original system. Operators are utilizing ESP in more and more challenging reservoirs with respect to temperature, viscosity, GOR, etc. This is a major challenge for ESP run life, so it is necessary to improve the existing technology to gain profit from producing oil with ESP. This report includes recommendations for ESP design and surveillance for the Peregrino field. These proposals are based on a survey of ESP failures conducted in the database ESP-RIFTS. The proposed ESP design includes; use of compression pumps with tandem <b>seals,</b> upgraded <b>technical</b> specifications with concern to materials, and utilization of proximity probes for vibration measurement. In addition is a LCC analysis performed, that identified work-over costs as the most critical cost drivers for Peregrino...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo analyze early {{technical}} {{success and}} late clinical success after endovascular entry sealing for chronic type B dissection with {{special emphasis on}} reintervention, false lumen thrombosis, and aortic remodeling. MethodsRetrospective analysis of a prospective database. From September 1999 to January 2011, 19 patients with chronic type B dissections were treated by endovascular entry sealing. Median age was 60 years. Median time between onset of acute dissection and surgical intervention was 36 (1 to 60) months. Median follow-up was 13 months (1 to 124). ResultsThe endografts used were: Medtronic Captivia (5), Medtronic Valiant (5), Gore TAG (6), Gore C-TAG (2), and Cook Zenith (1). In four patients, revascularization of the left subclavian artery was performed prior to entry <b>sealing.</b> Primary <b>technical</b> success rate (entry sealing, absence of type I leak) was 18 / 19 (94. 7 %). In-hospital mortality was 0 %. Spinal cord injury with persistent paraplegia occurred in 1 / 19 (5. 2 %) patients. After a maximal follow-up of 124 months, reinterventions in 9 / 19 (47. 3 %) were necessary: distal/proximal extension of stent graft (8), replacement of the aortic arch due to retrograde dissection (1), and open infrarenal aneurysm repair (1). During follow-up, none of the patients died due to stent-related complications. ConclusionEndovascular treatment (EVT) in chronic type B dissections has a high technical success rate and low mortality/morbidity. However reintervention rates are not negligible which might reduce the clinical success of EVT. Future investigations should aim at identifying patients who benefit from EVT at better defining the timing of EVT and at determining if entry sealing alone is sufficient...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Hemorrhoidectomy is {{considered}} the gold standard and {{the most effective and}} definitive treatment for grades 3 or 4 hemorrhoids, and Milligan-Morgan's and Ferguson's procedures are the most widely used techniques throughout the world. The aim {{of the study was to}} present our surgical technique using LigasureTM vessel <b>sealing,</b> focus on <b>technical</b> aspects and surgical tricks showing our results with a huge number of patients and a long-term follow-up. METHODS: Between June 2001 and June 2014 at the University Hospital of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy, 1000 patients were selected to underwent LigasureTM hemorrhoidectomy for III and IV degree hemorrhoids. Age range 19 - 80 years, ASA I-II-III. Operating time, postoperative pain score, hospital stay, early and late postoperative complications, wound healing time and time to return to normal activities were assessed. Patients were followed-up at one week, one month, six, and twelve months after the operation and after 60 months they responded to the follow-up telephone interview and replied to the questionnaire. RESULTS: One-thousand patients were undergone LigasureTM hemorrhoidectomy. The mean follow-up was 7 years and 110 (11...|$|R
