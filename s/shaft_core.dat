5000|$|During the {{manufacturing}} of the low-pressure shaft, {{at a location}} where its section diameter increases, a sharp, 90-degree step was made, resulting in a sudden diameter change over a very short linear length. In engineering terms, such sharp step instead of a radiused fillet causes a significant concentration of stress. This became a tragic, textbook example of stress concentration increase of a [...] "stepped shaft", which in-turn initiated the formation of micro-cracks through the material core, a phenomenon known as material fatigue. Additionally, the metallurgical analysis found that alloying impurities were present such as non-metallic inclusions in the alloy of the shaft, {{in addition to the}} incorrectly performed heat treatment process, which further reduced the shaft's ability to carry the torsional loads as designed. The improperly machined engine shaft, coupled with metallurgical alloy impurities, facilitated an accelerated fatigue of this key engine component via unmitigated formation of micro-cracks through the <b>shaft's</b> <b>core,</b> ultimately leading to its failure.|$|R

30|$|The {{problem of}} using the wire driven {{mechanism}} is an elongation of a wire, which decreases mechanical bandwidth. Therefore {{to be able to}} adjust wire tension easily a co-axial tensioner shaft shown in Fig. 13 was devised as the input pulley. The co-axial tensioner shaft has a dual structure made up of a <b>core</b> <b>shaft</b> which passes {{through the center of the}} input axis pulley, and an outer shaft which covers the lower half. Each shaft is connected with a compact roller type one-way clutch (NTN: HF 0612, torque capacity 1.76  Nm). Due to the one-way clutch, the two shafts turn relative to each other only in the direction which increases wire tension, and thus it is possible to adjust tension of the wire by rotating one of the shafts. The wire which is wound to the <b>core</b> <b>shaft</b> transmit power directly to the motor, but the wire wound to the outer shaft transmit power via one-way clutch.|$|R

In this investigation, a two-dimensional finite element model is applied to capture the stress distribution within sheet metal coils. The influence of support condition on the state of stress is investigated for sheet metal on a core alone, and for the cases in which the coil is supported by a drive <b>shaft</b> or <b>core</b> chucks during winding.

40|$|This {{research}} addressed two key issues: 1) Will verification cores holes fill during concrete backfilling? If so, {{what are}} the mechanical properties of the filling material? In dry conditions, verification core holes always completely fill with concrete whose compressive strength is of equal strength to the concrete in the drilled shaft column. In wet conditions, {{the bottom half of}} the verification core hole fills with non-cemented gravel-sand mixture (φ = 52 °), while the upper half of the verification core hole filled with weakly cemented material (Vp = 2000 fps). 2) When drilling in materials, such as shales, susceptible to degradation: does this degradation specifically around <b>shaft</b> verification <b>core</b> holes affect point bearing capacity? The shear strength of Del Rio Clay and Eagle Ford Shale is not affected by drying-duration, but is related to water content; the shear strength of Taylor Marl and Navarro Shale decreases considerably as drying-duration increases. The elastic modulus of all four clay shales drops significantly when clay shales are dried and then wetted. When shales are first dried and then rewetted and concrete is poured in the wet, the verification core hole reduces tip capacity by a maximum of 10 % (14 % for Taylor Marl). In all other cases, the verification core does not decrease the tip capacity...|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} tower Vertical Transportation concept had 12 {{lift shafts}} with standard double-decker elevators. However during the construction stage tender the VT scheme {{was replaced by}} an innovative TWIN system by ThyssenKrupp , the first elevator system to have two cabs running independently one above {{the other in the}} same shaft. This technology has many advantages over conventional elevator systems, including the fact that waiting and travel times are reduced to a minimum due to intelligent destination selection control system monitored by computer optimizing the travel logistics between calls. The use of innovative TWIN elevators saved 2 <b>shafts</b> within the <b>core</b> (10 TWINs up to 7m/sec speed instead of 12 double-deckers in the original concept with 12 double-decker elevators), freeing up an additional useful space in the building across all floors for MEP shafts. TWIN technology also contributed to the overall project sustainability with lesser power consumption per passenger (the ‘separated’ cabs in TWIN system are much lighter than double-decker cab, hence less  starting currents and resulting power consumption. The cabs are in fact similar to a single elevator production line , so the maintenance cost is less too due to availability of cheaper standard spare parts unlike in the bespoke double-deckers.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Catheter {{visualization}} {{and tracking}} remains {{a challenge in}} interventional MR. Active guidewires can be made conspicuous in "profile" along their whole <b>shaft</b> exploiting metallic <b>core</b> wire and hypotube components that are intrinsic to their mechanical performance. Polymer-based catheters, on the other hand, offer no conductive medium to carry radio frequency waves. We developed a new "active" catheter design for interventional MR with mechanical performance resembling braided X-ray devices. Our 75 cm long hybrid catheter shaft incorporates a wire lattice in a polymer matrix, and contains three distal loop coils in a flexible and torquable 7 Fr device. We explored the impact of braid material designs on radiofrequency and mechanical performance. Results The incorporation of copper wire into in a superelastic nitinol braided loopless antenna allowed good visualization of the whole shaft (70 cm) in vitro and in vivo in swine during real-time MR with 1. 5 T scanner. Additional distal tip coils enhanced tip visibility. Increasing the copper:nitinol ratio in braiding configurations improved flexibility {{at the expense of}} torquability. We found a 16 -wire braid of 1 : 1 copper:nitinol to have the optimum balance of mechanical (trackability, flexibility, torquability) and antenna (signal attenuation) properties. With this configuration, the temperature increase remained less than 2 °C during real-time MR within 10 cm horizontal from the isocenter. The design was conspicuous in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion We have engineered a new loopless antenna configuration that imparts interventional MR catheters with satisfactory mechanical and imaging characteristics. This compact loopless antenna design can be generalized to visualize the whole shaft of any general-purpose polymer catheter to perform safe interventional procedures. </p...|$|R

[...] The three-story glass building wrapped in aluminum, known as the Reynolds Metals Company's Great Lakes Sales Headquarters Building, was also supposed to reinforce the company's main product and showcase its admirable characteristics of strength and beauty. During this period, he created a number of office buildings which led to his innovative design of the 1360 ft towers of the World Trade Center in 1964, which began construction March 21, 1966. [...] The first of the towers was finished in 1970.

This narrow-windowed style arose from his own personal fear of heights.

Instead of placing a large traditional elevator <b>shaft</b> in the <b>core</b> of each tower, Yamasaki created the Twin Towers' [...] "Skylobby" [...] system. The Skylobby design created three separate, connected elevator systems which would serve different segments of the building, depending on which floor was chosen, saving approximately 70% of the space used for a traditional shaft.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The McTronX {{research}} {{group at the}} North–West University designs and develops Active Magnetic Bearings (AMBs). The group’s focus shifted to the design and development of AMB supported drive systems. This includes the electromagnetic and mechanical design of the electric machine, AMBs, auxiliary bearings {{as well as the}} development of the control system. The {{research group}} is currently developing an AMB supported high speed Induction Machine (IM) drive system that will facilitate tests in order to verify the design capability of the group. The research presented in this thesis describes the mechanical design and manufacturing of a high speed IM rotor section. The design includes; selecting the IM rotor topology, material selection, detail stress analysis and selecting appropriate manufacturing and assembly procedures. A comprehensive literature study identifies six main design considerations during the mechanical design of a high speed IM rotor section. These considerations include; magnetic core selection, rotor cage design, <b>shaft</b> design, shaft/magnetic <b>core</b> connection, stress due to operation at elevated temperatures and design for manufacture and assemble (DFMA). A critical overview of the literature leads to some design decisions being made and is used {{as a starting point for}} the detail design. The design choices include using a laminated cage rotor with a shrink fit for the shaft/magnetic core connection. Throughout the detail design an iterative process was followed incorporating both electromagnetic and mechanical considerations to deliver a good design solution. The first step of the iterative design process was, roughly calculating the material strengths required for first iteration material selection followed by more detailed interference fit calculations. From the detail stress analysis it became apparent that the stress in the IM rotor section cannot be calculated accurately using analytical methods. Consequently, a systematically verified and validated Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model was used to calculate the interferences required for each component. The detail stress analysis of the assembly also determined the allowable manufacturing dimensional tolerances. From the detail stress analysis it was found that the available lamination and squirrel cage material strengths were inadequate for the design speed specification of 27, 000 r/min. The analysis showed that a maximum operating speed of 19, 000 r/min can be achieved while complying with the minimum factor of safety (FOS) of 2. Each component was manufactured to the prescribed dimensional tolerances and the IM rotor section was assembled. With the failure of the first assembly process, machine experts were consulted and a revised process was implemented. The revised process entailed manufacturing five small lamination stacks and assembling the stack and squirrel cage afterwards. The end ring/conductive bar connection utilises interference fits due to the fact that the materials could not be welded. The process was successful and the IM rotor section was shrink fitted onto the shaft. However, after final machining of the rotor’s outer diameter (OD), inspections revealed axial displacement of the end rings and a revised FEA was implemented to simulate the effect. The results indicated a minimum FOS 0. 6 at very small sections and with further analytical investigation it was shown that the minimum FOS was reduced to only 1. 34. Although the calculations indicated the FOS was below the minimum prescribed FOS ? 2, the rotor spin tests were scheduled to continue as planned. The main reasons being that the lowest FOS is at very small areas and is located at non critical structural positions. The fact that the rotor speed was incrementally increased and multiple parameters were monitored, which could detect early signs of failure, further supported the decision. In testing the rotor was successfully spun up to 19, 000 r/min and 27 rotor delevitation test were conducted at speeds of up to 10, 000 r/min. After continuous testing a secondary rotor inspection was conducted and no visible changes could be detected. The lessons learnt leads to mechanical design and manufacturing recommendations and the research required to realise a 27, 000 r/min rotor design. Master...|$|R
