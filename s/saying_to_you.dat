"A {{people that}} {{suffered}} for 2,000 years, {{that went through}} the Holocaust, arrives at its patrimony but is thrust into a renewed round of bloodshed, that is perhaps the road to annihilation. In terms of cosmic justice, that's terrible. It's far more shocking than what happened in 1948 to {{a small part of}} the Arab nation that was then in Palestine...We are the greater victims in the course of history and we are also the greater potential victim. Even though we are oppressing the Palestinians, we are the weaker side here. We are a small minority in a large sea of hostile Arabs who want to eliminate us. So it's possible than [...] when their desire is realized, everyone will understand what I am <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> now. Everyone will understand we are the true victims. But by then it will be too late." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the defeat}} at Manila Bay, Contraalmirante Patricio Montojo y Pasarón was {{recalled}} to Madrid {{to be held}} as a scapegoat for the loss by the court-martial despite the circumstances {{that led to the}} defeat. He left Manila in October and arrived in November 1898. By decree of the court-martial, he was imprisoned in March 1899, but was later released. Among the testimony was Admiral George Dewey, to whom Montojo had sent a letter asking for assistance, and the American officer replied that [...] "Although without accurate knowledge as to the condition of your ships, I have no hesitation in <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> what I have already had the honor to report to my government, that your defense at Cavite was gallant in the extreme. The fighting of your flagship, which was singled out for attack, was especially worthy of a place in the traditions of valor of your nation." [...] Montojo was later absolved of the charges but was still discharged from the Spanish Navy. In June 2017, a screenplay was written based on Montojo's court-martial and Admiral Dewey assisting him in March 1899.|$|E
2500|$|Nash {{made his}} Test debut for the West Indies on 11 December 2008, playing against New Zealand. In the same match, fast-bowler Lionel Baker also made his debut. It was widely {{reported}} in the media {{that he was the}} first white man to play for the West Indies since Geoff Greenidge played five Tests in the early 1970s. He was subjected to racial abuse for being a [...] "white boy" [...] during trials for Jamaica. Chris Gayle, Jamaica's captain, helped Nash telling him that [...] "You are one of us, don't worry about what anyone's <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> If anyone troubles you, I am here for you." [...] It later emerged that he was of mixed race. He took his first Test wicket in the third Test against England when Matt Prior was caught by Shivnarine Chanderpaul off Nash's bowling. During the fifth Test in Trinidad Nash scored his maiden Test century, his innings of 109 included 17 fours. He shared a 234-run fifth wicket partnership with Chanderpaul. Nash continued his good form in the first Test against England with 81 during a 143-run partnership with Denesh Ramdin who made 61.|$|E
