40|$|This thesis called "Somatognosia by {{the chronic}} back pain patients" {{summarizes}} in its theoretical part {{the information about the}} concept of one's own body perception and clears up the terms body image and body schema in various contexts. The experimental part of the thesis includes testing of <b>somatognosia</b> on two sets. This research aims to compare the level and quality of <b>somatognosia</b> by the {{chronic back pain}} sufferers and healthy individuals. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|E
40|$|The {{feeling of}} "body ownership" may be {{experimentally}} investigated by perceptual illusions. The "rubber hand illusion" (RHI) leads human subjects to experience an artificial hand as their own. According to functional imaging, the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) {{plays a key}} role in the integration of multisensory inputs allowing the "incorporation" of the rubber hand into body representation. However, causal structure-function relationships can only be obtained by lesion studies. Here, we tested the RHI in 70 stroke patients and in 40 age-matched healthy controls. Additionally, asomatognosia, the unawareness of one's own body parts, was assessed in a subgroup of 64 stroke patients. Ischemic lesions were delineated on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images and normalized. Right-hemispheric lesions were mirrored across the midline. Voxels that might be essential for RHI and/or <b>somatognosia</b> were defined by voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping. Probabilistic diffusion tractography was used to identify tracts passing through these voxels. Contralesional rubber hand illusion failure (RHIF) was observed in 18 (26 %) of 70 stroke patients, an additional ipsilesional RHIF in seven of these patients. RHIF-associated lesion voxels were located subcortically adjacent to the insula, basal ganglia, and within the periventricular white matter. Tractography revealed fiber tract connections of these voxels with premotor, parietal, and prefrontal cortex. Contralesional asomatognosia was found in 18 (28 %) of 64 stroke patients. In contrast to RHIF, asomatognosia-associated lesion voxels showed no connection with PMv. The results point to a role of PMv and its connections in mediating changes in the sense of limb ownership driven by multisensory stimulation...|$|E
40|$|I {{chose the}} topic The Utilisation of the Feldenkrais Method in {{patients}} with backache without radicular irritation for my bachelor thesis. The method bears the name of its author Moshé Feldenkrais, who started to develop his conception after his own injury during the Second World War. Feldenkrais Method of somatic education is an approach employing {{the process of learning}} by means of movement. It is based on presumption that a human being has four basic constituents: feelings, thinking, sensual perception and movement, which are present to each human action, and which interact with one another, which results in the fact that influencing of one constituent causes changes in the others. The method has two basic approaches: group lessons Awareness Through Movement and Functional Integration. Backaches are now classified among so called ?civilisation diseases?, which is mostly given by today?s life style ? sedentary jobs, stress, lack of movement, which lead to numerous improper stereotypes leading later to pain occurrence. The spine and back in general, which are the most loaded parts in terms of posture maintenance against gravity are usually the first to be affected by chronic pain. Back pains are said to be the most frequent cause of inability to work. The thesis is structured in two parts. The theoretical part mainly deals with the Feldenkrais Method. At the beginning I introduce the author by his brief biography explaining the process of the conception development. Then I describe the principles and basic elements of the method like self-awareness, <b>somatognosia,</b> organic learning. Chapters containing indications and contraindications, possibilities and course of education in the field of Feldenkrais Method follow. The next part informs on two basic teaching methods, which are a group form ?Awareness Through Movement? and individual ?Functional Integration?, where I compare the first one with conventional exercises and the latter with classic manual techniques. In the last part dedicated to the Feldenkrais Method I am trying to outline the possibilities of applying Feldenkrais Method to chronic pain treatment. The following chapter of the theoretical part deals with the phenomenon of pain. In the last part I summarize the most frequent causes and consequences of backache and their schematic categorisation. The practical part contains the goals of the thesis, methodology description, research sample characteristic and the research results processed in the form of case studies. Quantitative research method was chosen for data collection and processing. Two patients with pains in cervical, respective lumbar spine were chosen. Anamnesis was taken from the patients and basic physiotherapeutic examination, which is recorded in the input and output kinesiological analyses, was performed. The research results aren´t so significant because of small testing group, but in my opinion the Feldenkrais Method might become a part of therapy for chronic pain treatment, as both the patients subjectively perceived improvement after the exercises, which is also obvious from objective examination recorded in the output kinesiological analysis. The fact that the research was based on just a small sample of probands however does not enable us to generalize the results. Remarkable improvement of perception and awareness of own body and work with it occurred in both the women, which was obvious on improved breath stereotype and mastering of localized breathing, which had been a big problem for both the patients before. Another improvement was in higher spine movement and particularly reduction of backache in both the patients. Improvement of psychical condition is surely another indicator of the method effectiveness...|$|E
