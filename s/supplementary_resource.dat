60|$|In {{the absence}} of the direct, we may next try, as in other cases, the <b>supplementary</b> <b>resource,</b> called in a former place the Indirect Method of Difference; which, instead of two {{instances}} differing in nothing but {{the presence or absence of}} a given circumstance, compares two classes of instances respectively agreeing in nothing but the presence of a circumstance on the one side and its absence on the other. To choose the most advantageous case conceivable (a case far too advantageous to be ever obtained), suppose that we compare one nation which has a restrictive policy with two or more nations agreeing in nothing but in permitting free trade. We need not now suppose that either of these nations agrees with the first in all its circumstances; one may agree with it in some of its circumstances, and another in the remainder. And it may be argued, that if these nations remain poorer than the restrictive nation, it can not be for want either of the first or of the second set of circumstances, but it must be for want of the protective system. If (we might say) the restrictive nation had prospered from the one set of causes, the first of the free-trade nations would have prospered equally; if by reason of the other, the second would; but neither has; therefore the prosperity was owing to the restrictions. This will be allowed to be a very favorable specimen of an argument from specific experience in politics, and if this be inconclusive, it would not be easy to find another preferable to it.|$|E
60|$|Whatever {{may be the}} {{efficacy}} of this method, it is, as we long ago remarked, not a method of pure observation and experiment; it concludes, not from a comparison of instances, but from the comparison of an instance with {{the result of a}} previous deduction. Applied to social phenomena, it presupposes that the causes from which part of the effect proceeded are already known; and as we have shown that these can not have been known by specific experience, they must have been learned by deduction from principles of human nature; experience being called in only as a <b>supplementary</b> <b>resource,</b> to determine the causes which produced an unexplained residue. But if the principles of human nature may be had recourse to for the establishment of some political truths, they may for all. If it be admissible to say, England must have prospered by reason of the prohibitory system, because after allowing for all the other tendencies which have been operating, there is a portion of prosperity still to be accounted for; it must be admissible to go to the same source for the effect of the prohibitory system, and examine what account the laws of human motives and actions will enable us to give of its tendencies. Nor, in fact, will the experimental argument amount to any thing, except in verification of a conclusion drawn from those general laws. For we may subtract the effect of one, two, three, or four causes, but we shall never succeed in subtracting the effect of all causes except one; while it would be a curious instance of the dangers of too much caution if, to avoid depending on a priori reasoning concerning the effect of a single cause, we should oblige ourselves to depend on as many separate a priori reasonings as there are causes operating concurrently with that particular cause in some given instance.|$|E

Lecture recording {{can also be used to}} create reference materials as a <b>supplementary</b> <b>resource.</b> Lecture recording is not always welcomed by university faculty. Faculty attitudes to this kind of technology enhanced learning may vary across disciplines. Student research has found that more students than staff expect lecture recording to be beneficial to learning. In the most part students watch lectures for pragmatic reasons rather than lecture quality. Students do not view recorded lectures as a replacement for attending live lectures, and often continue to attend face to face sessions. Students who use recorded lectures as a supplement sometimes score significantly higher in subsequent assessment.|$|E
5000|$|In 1964, {{the design}} of the map was taken over by Paul Garbutt who, like Beck, had {{produced}} a map in his spare time due to his dislike of the Hutchison design. Garbutt's map restored curves and bends to the diagram, but retained Hutchison's black interchange circles (the squares however were replaced with circles with a dot inside). Garbutt continued to produce Underground maps for at least another 20 years — Tube maps stopped bearing the designer's name in 1986, by which time the elements of the map bore a very strong resemblance to today's map.While the standard Tube map mostly avoided representing main line services, a new variant of the map issued in 1973, the [...] "London's Railways" [...] map, was the first to depict Tube and above-ground main line rail services in a diagrammatic style closely matched to Beck's designs.

Resource alignment, or how collaborating actors’ resources affect each other, is a concept that has been brought forward to explain when collaboration increases performance. As the category management of builders’ merchants involves actors with different sets of resources, the resource alignment framework can be used to better understand the outcomes of collaboration in category management. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore resource alignment among actors involved in the category management of builders’ merchants. The paper is based on interviews with top managers in Swedish builders’ merchants. Complementary and <b>supplementary</b> <b>resources</b> held by the involved actors are identified for four  distinguished category management activities.

40|$|Stable isotope {{analysis}} has provided crucial {{new insights into}} dietary change at the Neolithic transition in north-west Europe, indicating an unexpectedly sudden and radical shift from marine to terrestrial resources in coastal and island locations. Investigations of early Neolithic skeletal material from Sumburgh on Shetland, at the far-flung margins of the Neolithic world, suggest that this general pattern may mask significant subtle detail. Analysis of juvenile dentine reveals the consumption of marine foods on an occasional basis.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade {{there has been a}} rapid {{development}} of multimedia in education. Multimedia is the term used to describe a hypertext system that incorporates a variety of media besides literary text, including graphics, animation, video, sound, and hypertext links. Multimedia has enormous potential in the classroom, especially at elementary level, with a number of advantages for experiencing literary texts, as it calls on all the language skills (listening, reading, speaking, writing) as well as viewing skills. So far, multimedia has largely been used as a <b>supplementary</b> <b>resource,</b> for follow-up activities or as a form of reward in the classroom, but it can also provide a significant basis for literary instruction. For some teachers, multimedia may appear to be a reductive, even a trivializing, tool, compared to the conventional linear, verbal act of reading literature, a view that students do not seem to share. However, the introduction of the computer should force teachers to rethink their practices, while students should be motivated to learn in a new way. The use of multimedia also reflects changes in literature teaching methodology...|$|E
