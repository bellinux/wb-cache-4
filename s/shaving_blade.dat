50|$|Cuts from shaving can bleed {{for about}} fifteen minutes. Shaving cuts {{can be caused}} by blade {{movement}} perpendicular to the blade's cutting axis or by regular / orthogonal shaving over prominent bumps on the skin (which the blade incises). As such, the presence of acne can make shaving cuts more likely, and extra care must be exercised. The use of a fresh, sharp blade as well as proper cleaning and lubrication of skin can help prevent cuts. Common methods used to stop shaving-induced bleeding include: (1) pressing any simple alcohol onto the cut until the bleeding stops (e.g. with a cotton swab); (2) placing a small piece of tissue or toilet paper onto the cut; (3) applying styptic pencils and styptic liquids; (4) placing a small amount of petroleum jelly on the cut after most of the bleeding has ended (which can stop the bleeding without forming a scab), or (5) applying a small amount of aluminum chlorohydrate (commonly found in roll-on deodorants such as Ban). Shaving in or just after a cold shower can help prevent bleeding as well, because blood flow to the skin is reduced in these conditions because of vasoconstriction caused by the cold water. <b>Shaving</b> <b>blade</b> disposal in the era of safety razors and double-edged blades was a concern for a man's spouse and children who could easily take a blade, casually cast into the garbage, and in the process of compressing or compacting the garbage, cut themselves seriously. Some razor blade manufacturers include disposal containers or receptacles to avoid injuries.|$|E

50|$|Operations {{commenced}} in 1940, {{revolving around}} {{the manufacture of}} <b>shaving</b> <b>blades</b> to fulfill the demand of various saloons and barbers. It is this expertise in blade making that helped the company enter the segment of disposable razors subsequently. Products offered are manufactured by Vidyut Metallics Private Limited, which was incorporated in the year 1953 and is based in Mumbai, India. The brand Super-Max was conceived under the Vidyut Metallics banner in 1986 with product offerings of disposable-short handle razors targeted towards Mass Wholesalers in Eastern Europe and Dollar Stores and Pound Shops in the United States of America and United Kingdom respectively. Since then, business has spanned 5 continents - Asia, Africa, Europe, North America and South America with products being sold in more than 150 countries.|$|R
50|$|Naidu's 'Rasant' razor {{incorporated}} a small motor operated by dry cells, called Heilbronn. Among his other inventions were super-thin <b>shaving</b> <b>blades,</b> a distance adjuster for film cameras, a fruit juice extractor, a tamper-proof vote-recording machine and a kerosene-run fan. In 1941, {{he announced that}} he had the ability to manufacture five-valve Radio sets in India at a mere Rs 70/- a set. In 1952, the two-seater petrol engine car (costing a mere Rs 2,000/-) rolled out. But production was stopped subsequently, because of the Government's refusal to grant the necessary license. His inventiveness was not confined to machinery alone. He researched and identified new varieties in Cotton, Maize and Papaya. His farm was visited by Sir C. V. Raman and Visvesvaraya.

50|$|Shortly afterwards, Pierety {{proceeded}} {{to make an}} inventory of the Anne's cargo. On board the military found Spanish and Danish papers, a four-pound cannon, several muskets and guns, sabers and <b>shaving</b> <b>blades.</b> Pierety also led the refloating of the Anne. As soon as the news reached the coast, the militias led by captain Manuel Marcano sprang into action. At Guayama, the local troops began a search throughout the municipality. Parallel to this, mayor Francisco Brenes and Eugenio de Silvia, the subdelegate of the navy, did the same. Around 10:00 p.m. the first three pirates were caught. Another named Vicente Carbajal was found alone, still armed with a rifle. Through the search, Brenes acted in coordination with his colleague from Patillas, Tomás Pérez Guerras. Accompanied by two members of his crew, Cofresí managed to remain a fugitive until the next day. However, their pace was affected by the hostility of the swampy terrain. Near midnight, a Puerto Rican mulatto named Juan Candido Garay spotted Cofresí and his crew. Joined by fellow militiamen Domingo de Rivera, Matías Quiñones and Juan Rodríguez, the group ambushed the pirates.|$|R
50|$|Safety razors {{have been}} known to exist since at least 1876 when the {{single-edge}} Star safety razor was patented by brothers Frederick and Otto Kampfe. The razor was essentially a small piece of a straight razor attached to a handle using a clamp mechanism. Before each <b>shave</b> the <b>blade</b> had to be attached to a special holder, stropped with a leather belt, and placed back into the razor. After a time, the blade needed to be honed by a cutler.|$|R
50|$|Unlike prism {{sharpeners}}, linear blade sharpeners do not rotate {{relative to}} the pencil being sharpened, and {{may be viewed as}} just a special form of knife, with a mechanical guide for increased safety and convenience. Some models use replaceable <b>shaving</b> razor <b>blades,</b> while others have permanently-fitted blades. Linear blade sharpeners may require more skill, but they allow one to sharpen the tip of the pencil into any desired shape and angle of taper, whereas prism sharpeners have a fixed sharpening angle and produce circular symmetry.|$|R

50|$|Observant Jewish men {{are subject}} to {{restrictions}} on the shaving of their beards, as Leviticus 19:27 forbids the shaving of {{the corners of the}} head and prohibits the marring of the corners of the beard.

25|$|Because {{the biblical}} {{prohibition}} against shaving uses the Hebrew word gelech (גלח), {{which refers to}} <b>shaving</b> with a <b>blade</b> against the skin, Talmudic rabbis interpreted it to only refer to a blade, and only to the hair being cut close to the roots, in a smooth manner. This means that only a razor would be prohibited, trimming or non-razor shaving would be permitted.

40|$|For the LHC {{injectors}} upgrade (LIU) at CERN, the two PS (Proton Synchrotron) dumps will be redesigned and upgraded for the {{new high}} intensity beams. The EN-STI group {{is in charge of}} the design and installation of the new dumps, foreseen for the next CERN's Long Shutdown in 2019 - 2020. As internal dumps, the PS dumps have been installed in 1975 directly in the PS vacuum ring between the main bending magnets and they are operating since then. The dumps enter the beam line when requested by beam operation, with a 6 kg Cu block moved quickly with a spring-based mechanism. This Cu block is not expected to survive the impact of the future beams. A new design is presented for the dump core based on FLUKA-ANSYS coupled simulations. The dumps should work with any PS beam foreseen within LIU, be water cooled in ultra-high vacuum medium, and enter the beam chamber in less than 250 ms. The dump should be used 200000 times per year, with a lifetime of 20 years, with almost zero maintenance. The new challenging design is based on an oscillating thin <b>blade</b> <b>shaving</b> turn after turn the circulating beam. The material considered for the blade are Cu, Ti or CuCrZr with embedded cooling channels...|$|R
5000|$|To sharpen or {{finish the}} blade using a {{suspended}} strop, the razor is pushed toward the suspension ring while both {{the back and}} the cutting edge lie flat on the strop and {{with the back of}} the blade. No pressure should be applied on the cutting edge. A strop may be two sided with leather on one side and cloth on the other side. The cloth is used for blade alignment and sharpening. The leather is for finishing.The stropping process involves sliding the razor blade flat on the strop; upon reaching the end of the cloth or leather near the suspension ring, the blade is turned about its back (clockwise for a right-handed barber; counter-clockwise for a left-handed one) until the cutting edge touches the strop. It is then pulled toward the rectangular handle of the strop with back and cutting edge flat on the strop as before. The blade is moved in a slightly diagonal direction so to give every point of the edge a chance to touch the strop, without applying too much pressure. This process aligns the cutting edge properly with the back of the blade, avoiding [...] "bumps" [...] on the cutting edge. Rotating the blade on the strop about the cutting edge can damage it because such use will impact the micro-alignment of the edge. Depending on use and condition, the blade can be sharpened occasionally by using a razor hone. Strops prepared with pastes containing fine grit are also used for honing but are not recommended for the inexperienced user, as they can easily rake off the edge if they apply the wrong amount or exert too much pressure.Some strops have a linen or canvas back embedded with a fine abrasive used to maintain a sharp edge before final polishing with the leather side. A face's worth of thick hair may require multiple stroppings for one <b>shave,</b> but a <b>blade</b> is usually honed only {{two or three times a}} year. Occasional regrinding by a professional may be required to restore a badly worn or damaged edge.|$|R
40|$|This {{collection}} of three reports describes desktop and laboratory flume studies that provide information to support {{assessment of the}} potential for injury and mortality of fish that encounter hydrokinetic turbines of various designs installed in tidal and river environments. Behavioral responses to turbine exposure also are investigated to support assessment {{of the potential for}} disruptions to upstream and downstream movements of fish. The studies: (1) conducted an assessment of potential injury mechanisms using available data from studies with conventional hydro turbines; (2) developed theoretical models for predicting blade strike probabilities and mortality rates; and (3) performed flume testing with three turbine designs and several fish species and size groups in two laboratory flumes to estimate survival rates and document fish behavior. The project yielded three reports which this document comprises. The three constituent documents are addressed individually below Fish Passage Through Turbines: Application of Conventional Hydropower Data to Hydrokinetic Technologies Fish passing through the blade sweep of a hydrokinetic turbine experience a much less harsh physical environment than do fish entrained through conventional hydro turbines. The design and operation of conventional turbines results in high flow velocities, abrupt changes in flow direction, relatively high runner rotational and blade speeds, rapid and significant changes in pressure, and the need for various structures throughout the turbine passageway that can be impacted by fish. These conditions generally do not occur or are not significant factors for hydrokinetic turbines. Furthermore, compared to conventional hydro turbines, hydrokinetic turbines typically produce relatively minor changes in shear, turbulence, and pressure levels from ambient conditions in the surrounding environment. Injuries and mortality from mechanical injuries will be less as well, mainly due to low rotational speeds and strike velocities, and an absence of structures that can lead to grinding or abrasion injuries. Additional information is needed to rigorously assess the nature and magnitude of effects on individuals and populations, and to refine criteria for design of more fish-friendly hydrokinetic turbines. Evaluation of Fish Injury and Mortality Associated with Hydrokinetic Turbines Flume studies exposed fish to two hydrokinetic turbine designs to determine injury and survival rates and to assess behavioral responses. Also, a theoretical model developed for predicting strike probability and mortality of fish passing through conventional hydro turbines was adapted for use with hydrokinetic turbines and applied to the two designs evaluated during flume studies. The flume tests were conducted with the Lucid spherical turbine (LST), a Darrieus-type (cross flow) turbine, and the Welka UPG, an axial flow propeller turbine. Survival rates for rainbow trout tested with the LST were greater than 98 % for both size groups and approach velocities evaluated. Turbine passage survival rates for rainbow trout and largemouth bass tested with the Welka UPG were greater than 99 % for both size groups and velocities evaluated. Injury rates of turbine-exposed fish were low with both turbines and generally comparable to control fish. Video observations of the LST demonstrated active avoidance of turbine passage by a large proportion fish despite being released about 25 cm upstream of the turbine blade sweep. Video observations from behavior trials indicated few if any fish pass through the turbines when released farther upstream. The theoretical predictions for the LST indicated that strike mortality would begin to occur at an ambient current velocity of about 1. 7 m/s for fish with lengths greater than the thickness of {{the leading edge of the}} blades. As current velocities increase above 1. 7 m/s, survival was predicted to decrease for fish passing through the LST, but generally remained high (greater than 90 %) for fish less than 200 mm in length. Strike mortality was not predicted to occur during passage through a Welka UPG turbine at ambient current velocities less than about 2. 5 m/s. Survival and Behavior of Juvenile Atlantic Salmon and Adult American Shad on Exposure to a Hydrokinetic Turbine This report describes a series of experiments designed to measure the effect of exposure to a full-scale, vertical axis hydrokinetic turbine on downstream migrating juvenile Atlantic salmon and upstream migrating adult American shad. Studies were performed in a large-scale, open-channel flume, and all individuals approached the turbine under volitional control. No injuries were observed, and there was no measurable increase in mortality associated with turbine passage. Exposure to the turbine elicited behavioral responses from both species, however, with salmon passing primarily over the downrunning <b>blades.</b> <b>Shad</b> movement was impeded in the presence of the device, as indicated by fewer attempts of shorter duration and reduced distance of ascent up the flume. More work should be performed in both laboratory and field conditions to determine the extent to which observed effects are likely to influence fish in riverine environments. Analysis is needed to assess the potential for multiple units to lead to greater mortality rates or impacts on fish movements and migrations. Additionally, future research should focus on expanding the existing data by developing better estimates of encounter and avoidance probabilities...|$|R
