5|$|In 1912, Chinese {{businesses}} began relocating {{from the}} Loop to Chicago's South Side. <b>Starting</b> <b>this</b> trend, the On Leong Chinese Merchants Association appealed to deed-holder and former Illinois State's Attorney Jacob J. Kern to hire architect H. J. Swanson {{to design a}} building large enough to house 15stores, 30apartments and office space on the 200 block of West 22nd Street (now Cermak Road).

The Association relocated to the building's third floor by 1914.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Newman recollaborated with Stanton on WALL-E {{since the}} two got along well on Nemo, which gave Newman the Annie Award for Best Music in an Animated Feature. He began writing the score in 2005, {{in the hope that}} <b>starting</b> <b>this</b> task early would make him more {{involved}} with the finished film. But, Newman remarked that animation is so dependent on scheduling he should have begun work earlier on when Stanton and Reardon were writing the script. EVE's theme was arranged {{for the first time in}} October 2007. Her theme when played as she first flies around Earth originally used more orchestral elements, and Newman was encouraged to make it sound more feminine. Newman said Stanton had thought up many ideas for how he wanted the music to sound, and he generally followed them as he found scoring a partially silent film difficult. Stanton wanted the whole score to be orchestral, but Newman felt limited by this idea especially in scenes aboard the Axiom, and used electronics too.|$|E
