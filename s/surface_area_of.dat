30|$|The {{reactive}} <b>surface</b> <b>area,</b> {{an important}} parameter controlling mineral reactions, affects {{the amount of}} mineralization trapping of CO 2 which affects the long-term CO 2 storage. The effect <b>of</b> the reactive <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> on the mineralization trapping of CO 2 was numerically simulated for CO 2 storage in saline aquifers. Three kinds of minerals, including anorthite, calcite and kaolinite, {{are involved in the}} mineral reactions. This paper models the relationship between the specific <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> and the grain diameter of anorthite based on experimental data from literature (Brantley and Mellott, 2000). When the reactive <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> anorthite and calcite decrease from 838 to 83.8 m 2 /m 3, the percentage of mineralization trapping of CO 2 after 500 years decreases from 11.8 % to 0.65 %. The amount of dissolved anorthite and the amounts of precipitated kaolinite and calcite decrease significantly when the reactive <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> anorthite and calcite decrease from 838 to 83.8 m 2 /m 3. Calcite is initially dissolved in the brine and then precipitates during the geochemical reactions between CO 2 -H 2 O and the minerals. Different reactive <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> anorthite and calcite lead to different times from dissolution to precipitation. The pH of the brine decreases with decreasing reactive <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> anorthite and calcite which influences the acidity of the saline aquifer. The gas saturation between the upper and lower parts of the saline aquifer increases with decreasing reactive <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> anorthite and calcite. The mass density distribution of brine solution shows that the CO 2 +brine solution region increases with decreasing reactive <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> anorthite and calcite.|$|R

The surface low and the upper-level low turned westward as it revolved around a common center, and by August 11, the surface low developed into a trough while 440miles (700km) south of Bermuda. As the system rapidly continued westward, much of the convection remained {{near the center of the}} upper-level low, preventing development of a closed surface circulation. On August 13, while located near the northwestern Bahamas, a substantial increase in convection resulted in the upper-level low building downwards to the middle levels of the troposphere, coinciding with the development of an upper level anticyclone.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundPrevious {{work from}} this {{laboratory}} has evidenced the biomechanical role of forearm osseoligamentous structures in load transfer of applied forces. It {{has shown that}} transmitted forces across the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) and proximal radioulnar joint (PRUJ) are similar though not identical under axial loading conditions. The {{purpose of the study}} was to assess the articulating <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> the radioulnar joints and the volumes of the forearm bones addressing the hypothesis that there may be anatomic adaptations that reflect the biomechanical function of the integrated forearm unit. MethodsThe articulating <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> PRUJ and DRUJ were assessed using a laser scanner in 24 cadaver forearms. The articulating joint surfaces were additionally delineated from standardized photographs assessed by three observers. The <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> matched pairs of joints were compared on the null hypothesis that these were the same within a given forearm specimen. An additional 44 pairs of matched forearm bone volumes were measured using water displacement technique and again compared through statistical analysis (paired sample t-test, and Bland Altman analysis). ResultsThe findings of this study are that the articulating <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> the DRUJ and PRUJ as well as the bone volumes are significantly different and yet strongly correlated. The paired sample t-test showed a significant difference between the <b>surface</b> <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> the DRUJ and PRUJ (p< 0. 05). The PRUJ articulating <b>surface</b> <b>area</b> was marginally larger than the DRUJ with a PRUJ : DRUJ ratio of 1. 02. Paired sample t-test showed a significant difference between the two bone volumes (p< 0. 01) with a radius to ulna bone volume ratio of 0. 81. When the olecranon was disregarded, radius volume was on average 4 % greater than ulna volume. ConclusionsThis study demonstrated defines the anatomical relationships between the two forearm bones and their articulating joints when matched for specimen. The data obtained are consistent with the theory of integrated forearm function generated from published biomechanical studies...|$|R
