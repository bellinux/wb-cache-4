Imamura (1997) argued that the momentum deposition by midlatitude Rossby waves might drive the poleward circulation above clouds. Numerical model results suggest that only extremely weak meridional circulation can exist at lower heights when a realistic diabatic heating is imposed in the lowest several scale heights (Hollingsworth et al., 2007).

The {{published}} {{article is}} copyrighted by the American Meteorological Society {{and can be}} found at: [URL] variation of the sea surface sensible heat flux is investigated using data from the Gulf of Tehuantepec Experiment (GOTEX) and from eight additional aircraft datasets representing a variety of surface conditions. This analysis focuses on near-neutral conditions because these conditions are common over the sea and are normally neglected, partly because of uncertain reliability of measurements of the small air–sea temperature difference. For all of the datasets, upward heat flux is observed for <b>slightly</b> <b>stable</b> conditions. The frequency of this “countergradient” heat flux increases with increasing wind speed and is possibly related to sea spray or microscale variations of surface temperature on the wave scale. Upward area-averaged sensible heat flux for <b>slightly</b> <b>stable</b> conditions can also be generated by mesoscale heterogeneity of the sea surface temperature (SST). Significant measurement errors cannot be ruled out. The countergradient heat flux for weakly stable conditions is least systematic for weaker winds, even though it occurs with weak winds in all of the datasets. In an effort to reduce offset errors and different SST processing and calibration procedures among field programs, the authors adjusted the SST in each field program to minimize the countergradient flux for weak winds. With or without this adjustment for the combined dataset, the extent of the upward heat flux for weakly stable conditions increases with increasing wind speed...|$|E

For low wind speeds and neutral to <b>slightly</b> <b>stable</b> conditions, neutral stability wind is quite sensitive to stability. A variational analysis procedure for the scatterometer data, which adjusts both the near-surface velocity and temperature, is developed.

40|$|Using {{time series}} {{measurements}} of velocity, {{carbon dioxide and}} water vapour concentration, and temperature collected just above a 15 m tall even-aged pine forest, we quantify the role of organized motion on scalar and momentum transport within the nocturnal canopy sublayer (CSL). We propose a framework in which the nocturnal CSL has two end-members, both dominated by organised motion. These end-members represent fully developed turbulent flows at near-neutral or <b>slightly</b> <b>stable</b> stratification and no turbulence for very stable stratification. Our analysis suggests that ramps dominate scalar transport for near-neutral and <b>slightly</b> <b>stable</b> conditions, while linear canopy waves dominate the flow dynamics for very stable conditions. For intermediate stability, the turbulence is highly damped and often dominated by fine scale motions. Co-spectral analysis suggests that ramps are the most efficient net scalar mass-transporting agent while linear canopy waves contribute little to net scalar transport between the canopy and atmosphere for averaging intervals that include complete wave cycles. However, canopy waves significantly contribute to the spectral properties of the scalar time series. Ramps are the most frequently occurring organised motion in the nocturnal CSL for this site. Numerous night-time runs, however, resided between these two end-members. Our analysis suggests that when radiative perturbations are sufficient large (> 20 W m- 2 in net radiation), the flow can switch from being highly damped fine-scale turbulence to being organized with ramp-like properties. We also found that when ramps are already the dominant eddy motion in the nocturnal CSL, radiative perturbations have a minor impact on scalar transport. Finally, in agreement with previous studies, we found that ramps and canopy waves have comparable length scales of about 30 - 60 metres. Consequences to night-time flux averaging are also discussed...|$|E

The characteristic flows fall into the skimming flow regime for all the cases tested. The mean wind speed is increased and decreased, respectively, in unstable and stable conditions. Turbulence is enhanced in unstable conditions. Whereas, in stable conditions, the low-level temperature inversion weakens the recirculating flows forming another layer of stagnant air {{in the vicinity of}} the ground level. Unexpectedly, an increase in turbulence is found in the street canyon core in the <b>slightly</b> <b>stable</b> condition (Richardson number Rb= 0. 18). The turbulence promotion could be caused by the unique geometry of 2 D street canyon in which the stable stratification slows down the primary recirculation. The rather stagnant flows in turn sharpen the roof-level vertical velocity gradient and deter the entrainment penetrating down to the ground level, leading to a substantial pollutant accumulation. While the pollutant tends to be well mixed in the street canyons in neutral and unstable conditions, a mildly improved pollutant removal in unstable conditions is observed because of the enhanced roof-level buoyancy-driven turbulence. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to numerically investigate the effects of the atmospheric boundary layer on the aerodynamic performance and loads of a novel dual-rotor wind turbine (DRWT). Large eddy simulations are carried out with the turbines operating in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and in a uniform inflow. Two stability conditions corresponding to neutral and <b>slightly</b> <b>stable</b> atmospheres are investigated. The turbines are modeled using the actuator line method where the rotor blades are modeled as body forces. Comparisons are drawn between the DRWT and a comparable conventional single-rotor wind turbine (SRWT) to assess changes in aerodynamic efficiency and loads, as well as wake mixing and momentum and kinetic energy entrainment into the turbine wake layer. The results show that the DRWT improves isolated turbine aerodynamic performance by about 5 %– 6 %. The DRWT also enhances turbulent axial momentum entrainment by about 3. 3 %. The highest entrainment is observed in the neutral stability case when the turbulence in the ABL is moderately high. Aerodynamic loads for the DRWT, measured as out-of-plane blade root bending moment, are marginally reduced.

In this study, a deterministic landslide modeling using Newmark Method was executed in order to produce a more detailed attributes for landslide susceptibility classification. The geotechnical properties of rock were obtained using Slope Stability Probability Classification (SSPC) while the reconstituted soil samples had undergone Direct Shear Test. Three rock exposures show cohesion values of 20, 170 Pa, 25, 350 Pa, 11, 700 Pa, and friction angle values of 40. 22 o, 49. 22 o, and 24. 43 o. Two soil samples show cohesion values of 12, 944. 78 Pa and 8, 041 Pa, and friction angle values of 29. 41 o and 44. 69 o. The factor of safety, critical acceleration, and peak ground acceleration, was computed using the cohesion and friction angle as parameters, generating a slope stability model.

40|$|A minimal 3 D {{numerical}} model designed for basic studies of tropical cyclone behavior is described. The model is formulated in s coordinates on an f or b plane and has three vertical levels, one characterizing a shallow boundary layer {{and the other}} two representing the upper and lower troposphere, respectively. It has three options for treating cumulus convection on the subgrid scale and a simple scheme for the explicit release of latent heat on the grid scale. The subgrid-scale schemes are based on the mass-flux models suggested by Arakawa and Ooyama in the late 1960 s, but modified to include the effects of precipitation-cooled downdrafts. They differ from one another in the closure that determines the cloud-base mass flux. One closure {{is based on the assumption}} of boundary layer quasi-equilibrium proposed by Raymond and Emanuel. It is shown that a realistic hurricane-like vortex develops from a moderate strength initial vortex, even when the initial environment is <b>slightly</b> <b>stable</b> to deep convection. This is true for all three cumulus schemes as well as in the case where only the explicit release of latent heat is included. In all cases there is a period of gestation during which the boundary layer moisture in the inner core region increases on account of surface moisture fluxes, followed by a period of rapid deepening. Precipitation from the convection scheme dominates the explicit precipitation in the early stages of development, but this situation is reversed as the vortex matures. These findings are similar to those of Baik et al., who used the Betts [...] Miller parameterization scheme in an axisymmetric model with 11 levels in the vertical.

40|$|In {{order to}} produce {{hydrogen}} peroxide in small-scale electrochemical plants, selective catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) toward the desired species are required. Here, we report about the synthesis, characterization, ORR electrochemical behavior, and reaction mechanism of an aza-fused π-conjugated microporous polymer, which presents high selectivity toward hydrogen peroxide. It was synthesized by polycondensation of 1, 2, 4, 5 -benzenetetramine tetrahydrochloride and triquinoyl octahydrate. A cobalt-modified version of the material was also prepared by a simple postsynthesis treatment with a Co(II) salt. The characterization of the material {{is consistent with the}} formation of a conductive robust porous covalent laminar polyaza structure. The ORR properties of these catalysts were investigated using rotating disk and rotating disk–ring arrangements. The results indicate that hydrogen peroxide is almost exclusively produced at very low overpotentials on these materials. Density functional theory calculations provide key elements to understand the reaction mechanism. It is found that, at the relevant potential for the reaction, half of the nitrogen atoms of the material would be hydrogenated. This hydrogenation process would destabilize some carbon atoms in the lattice and would provide segregated charge. On the destabilized carbon atoms, molecular oxygen would be chemisorbed with the aid of charge transferred from the hydrogenated nitrogen atoms and solvation effects. Due to the low destabilization of the carbon sites, the resulting molecular oxygen chemisorbed state, which would have the characteristics of a superoxide species, would be only <b>slightly</b> <b>stable,</b> promoting the formation of hydrogen peroxide.

Atmospheric stability measurements in terms of Richardson number from a met mast at an adjoining site have been obtained and {{used to assess the}} impact of stability on wake development. Considerable filtering of these data has been undertaken to ensure that all turbines are working normally and are well aligned with the wind direction. A group of six wind turbines, more or less in a line, have been selected for analysis, and winds within a 2 degree direction sector about this line are used to ensure, as far as possible, that all the turbines investigated are fully immersed in the wake/s of the upstream turbine/s. Results show how the terrain effects combine with the wake effects, with both being of comparable importance for the site in question. Comparison has been made with results from two commercial CFD codes for neutral stability, and reasonable agreement is demonstrated. Richardson number has been plotted against wind shear and turbulence intensity at a met mast on the wind farm that for the selected wind direction is not in the wake of any turbines. Good correlations are found indicating that the Richardson numbers obtained are reliable. The filtered data used for wake analysis were split according to Richardson number into two groups representing <b>slightly</b> <b>stable</b> to neutral, and unstable conditions.

Measurements were taken from the seven main monitoring stations in different locations of the city. These stations are controlled by Department of Environment of Iran. As a first step; annual, seasonal and diurnal variations were studied. The yearly variation does not show any specific trend initially but in the recent years it seems there is a little upward trend. The pick of concentration of SO 2 can be seen during 6 - 12 hour and during the winter season especially in January. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to see the effect of the meteorological parameters on the concentration of pollutant. For this purpose, the wind velocity, relative humidity, temperature, dew point, wind direction and rainfall are considered as independent variables. The relation between concentration of pollutant and meteorological parameters can be expressed by one linear regression equation. It is obvious from the equation that the wind speed, daily temperature and humidity have reverse effect on the concentration of SO 2. To plan and execute air pollution control programs, one must predict the ambient air concentrations that will result from any planned set of emissions. For this purpose, a two-dimensional atmospheric diffusion model for ambient air concentration of SO 2 was considered. Geostrophic winds, surface roughness, mixing height of the atmosphere, emission rate of the pollutant sources and background pollutant concentration have been taken as the input parameters. The airspace over the city to the mixing height was divided into multiple cells. Conservation of mass equations for each cell were solved for <b>slightly</b> <b>stable</b> and highly stable atmospheric conditions of city.

40|$|Observational data {{collected}} in the Lake Tekapo hydro catchment of the Southern Alps in New Zealand are used to analyse the wind and temperature fields in the alpine lake basin during summertime fair weather conditions. Measurements from surface stations, pilot balloon and tethersonde soundings, Doppler sodar and an instrumented light aircraft provide evidence of multi-scale interacting wind systems, ranging from microscale slope winds to mesoscale coast-to-basin flows. Thermal forcing of the winds occurred due to differential heating {{as a consequence of}} orography and heterogeneous surface features, which is quantified by heat budget and pressure field analysis. The daytime vertical temperature structure was characterised by distinct layering. Features of particular interest are the formation of thermal internal boundary layers due to the lake-land discontinuity and the development of elevated mixed layers. The latter were generated by advective heating from the basin and valley sidewalls by slope winds and by a superimposed valley wind blowing from the basin over Lake Tekapo and up the tributary Godley Valley. Daytime heating in the basin and its tributary valleys caused the development of a strong horizontal temperature gradient between the basin atmosphere and that over the surrounding landscape, and hence the development of a mesoscale heat low over the basin. After noon, air from outside the basin started flowing over mountain saddles into the basin causing cooling in the lowest layers, whereas at ridge top height the horizontal air temperature gradient between inside and outside the basin continued to increase. In the early evening, a more massive intrusion of cold air caused rapid cooling and a transition to a rather uniform <b>slightly</b> <b>stable</b> stratification up to about 2000 m agl. The onset time of this rapid cooling varied about 1 - 2 h between observation sites and was probably triggered by the decay of up-slope winds inside the basin, which previously countered the intrusion of air over the surrounding ridges. The intrusion of air from outside the basin continued until about mid-night, when a northerly mountain wind from the Godley Valley became dominant. The results illustrate the extreme complexity that can be caused by the operation of thermal forcing processes at a wide range of spatial scales...|$|E
25|$|The 6-vertex {{edge ring}} does {{not conform to}} the shape of a perfect hexagon. The {{conformation}} of a flat 2D planar hexagon has considerable angle strain because its bonds are not 109.5 degrees; the torsional strain would also be considerable because all of the bonds would be eclipsed bonds. Therefore, to reduce torsional strain, cyclohexane adopts a three-dimensional structure known as the chair conformation. There are also two other intermediate conformers; half chair, which is the most unstable conformer, and twist boat, which is more stable than the boat conformer. This was first proposed as early as 1890 by Hermann Sachse, but only gained widespread acceptance much later. The new conformation puts the carbons at an angle of 109.5°. Half of the hydrogens are in the plane of the ring (equatorial) while the other half are perpendicular to the plane (axial). This conformation allows for the most stable structure of cyclohexane. Another conformation of cyclohexane exists, known as boat conformation, but it interconverts to the <b>slightly</b> more <b>stable</b> chair formation. If cyclohexane is mono-substituted with a large substituent, then the substituent will most likely be found attached in an equatorial position, as this is the <b>slightly</b> more <b>stable</b> conformation.|$|R
30|$|Different {{experiments}} {{have shown that}} isotopic ratios of food only change slightly during cooking [88 – 92], and that food crust isotope ratios do not change during burial [89], or only change <b>slightly</b> [93]. <b>Stable</b> isotope measurements can therefore be useful for roughly distinguishing different food sources. It is important here not only to measure δ 13 C values, but also δ 15 N values, as “terrestrial” δ 13 C values can {{be the result of}} mixed marine and freshwater resources [61].|$|R
40|$|The {{isomerization}} {{reaction of}} E- and Z-alpha-phenylcinnamic acid molecules was {{studied at the}} level of semiempirical quantum chemical methods (MNDO, AM 1 and PM 3). Calculations revealed that Z-alpha-phenylcinnamic acid is <b>slightly</b> more <b>stable</b> than the E isomer. The activation enthalpy for isomerization and the transition-state structure were also determined. The difference in the acidities of the mio stereoisomers of alpha-phenylcinnamic acid and cinnamic acid (this is the basis of their separation experimentally) was rationalized by computing the dipole moments of the ions...|$|R
