The study, framed within a larger research, focuses specifically on the rhetorical movements of the introductions following the CARS model (<b>Swales,</b> <b>1990,</b> <b>2004).</b> The results are analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively, contrasting them with those extracted from comparable research articles published by native researchers in Spanish and Slovene. The aim of the research is to establish criteria regarding the differences and similarities of the academic discourse of the Slovene researchers in relation to the native speakers of Spanish, pointing out where didactic applications to solve the existing disparities are needed, in order that their productions will be in line with the expectations of the audience to which they are directed...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} many move {{analyses}} of research article introductions, including several that have drawn on academic corpora, starting with (and heavily influenced by) the work of <b>Swales</b> (1981, <b>1990,</b> <b>2004).</b> The conventions for structuring research articles are relatively stable and are well-understood {{by members of the}} relevant research communities; research article introductions are almost always demarcated by section headings, for example, and typically consist of a series of moves aiming to create a ‘research space’ for the article to occupy. In many other academic genres, however, there is greater variation in the purpose and structure of introductory sections. Even if they all function to ‘introduce the academic work’ (Bhatia 1997 : 182), practitioners do not necessarily agree about their generic features. Nesi and Gardner (2012 : 98) found considerable variation in the role of introductions in student essays, for example, and Bhatia’s informants disagreed about the distinctions between introductions, prefaces and forewords to academic books (1997 : 183) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{extent to}} which {{research}} hypotheses need to be incorporated in experimental studies often becomes a subject of discussion among academics supervising the writing of theses and dissertations. While writers are concerned about how hypotheses can be strategically linked with other elements in research reports to effectively present an introductory chapter, instructors are considering ways of guiding learners to use the appropriate language in postulating research hypotheses. Using an analytical framework developed by <b>Swales</b> (<b>1990</b> & <b>2004)</b> and specialist informants’ qualitative data, this largely qualitative investigation looks into a corpus of experimental doctoral dissertations submitted to 32 American universities from 2001 to 2009 in order to ascertain (i) {{the degree to which}} research hypotheses need to be presented in dissertation introductions, (ii) how hypotheses are strategically linked with other rhetorical segments, and (iii) the salient linguistic mechanisms used to achieve the communicative functions. This study has revealed (i) how writers shift from pertinent communicative moves to the postulation of hypotheses, and (ii) the gamut of major language choices employed to postulate these hypotheses. The findings can be used to prepare teaching materials that help learners comprehend and employ the rhetorical strategies and linguistic mechanisms needed in postulating hypotheses in research reports...|$|R

Encroaching on different trends in the analysis of written academic discourse – among them contrastive rhetoric (Connor, 1996), academic discourse (Hyland, 2009), evaluation (Hunston & Thompson, 2001), and genre (<b>Swales,</b> <b>1990</b> & <b>2004)</b> – the papers included in this volume approach the issue of reader-oriented view of writing (Hoey, 2001), social interaction or interpersonality (Hyland, 2004 & 2010; Flottum, 2007) {{in a wide range of}} disciplines such as business organisation, economics, law, linguistics, literature, medicine, psychology and physics, from different angles and perspectives.

40|$|This paper {{constitutes}} a multidimensional explanation of an integration of genre-based knowledge and evaluative stance {{in the context}} of academic arguments employed in the conclusion sections of English and Malay research articles. For this purpose, it draws on an analysis of the features in Appraisal theory (Martin & Rose, 2003) integrated with an analysis of communicative purposes within a genre analysis framework (<b>Swales,</b> <b>1990,</b> <b>2004).</b> Among others, the findings include the observation that evaluative and dialogic stances jointly produce rhetorical effects in both English and Malay conclusions. English conclusions contain a subtle balance of assertion and mitigation while Malay conclusions tend to contract dialogic space and thus could be interpreted as less reader-friendly. This suggests that evaluation and the meaning potential of the genre are experienced and valued differently by scholars publishing in these two different scientific communities (international and local). This variation seems to be due to linguistic, contextual, and potential social cultural influences within the two academic discourse communities.

40|$|Research in {{the area}} of {{academic}} writing has demonstrated that writing varies significantly across disciplines and among genres within disciplines. Two important approaches to studying diversity in disciplinary academic writing have been the genre-based approach and the corpus-based approach. Genre studies have considered the situatedness of writing tasks, including the larger socio-cultural context of the discourse community (e. g., Berkenkotter & Huckin, 1995; Bhatia, 2004) as well as the move structure in specific genres like the research article (e. g., <b>Swales,</b> <b>1990,</b> <b>2004).</b> Corpus- based studies of disciplinary writing have focused more closely on the linguistic variation across registers, with the research article being the most widely studied register (e. g., Cortes, 2004; Gray, 2011). Studies of undergraduate writing in the disciplines have tended to focus on task classification (e. g., Braine, 1989; Horowitz, 1986 a), literacy demands (e. g.,Carson, Chase, Gibson, & Hargrove, 1992), or student development (e. g., Carroll, 2002; Leki, 2007).

D. theses written by first language writers of Japanese or English were collected from three Japanese and three British universities. Genre analysis of 99 introductory chapters was conducted using a revised “Create a Research Space” (CARS) model (<b>Swales,</b> <b>1990,</b> <b>2004).</b> Semi-structured interviews were also carried out with seven Japanese supervisors and ten British supervisors.

40|$|Since the 1990 s the {{analysis}} of written academic genres has received an increasing attention among discourse and rhetorical studies (<b>Swales</b> <b>1990,</b> <b>2004).</b> The doctoral thesis has been little studied, {{as compared to the}} amount of work carried out on the research article. Despite this, there have been several attempts to describe specific aspects of PhD theses as a genre, in particular the rhetorical moves of certain sections, such as the introduction (Bunton, 2002), the conclusion (Bunton, 2005) and the literature review (Kwan, 2006), as well as the organizational structure or macrostructure of PhD theses (Thompson, 1999; Paltridge, 2002). Other studies have focused on different rhetorical-linguistic aspects, like the use of metatext (Bunton, 1999), citation practices and modal verbs (Thompson, 2001). In the Spanish literature, however, the tradition of genre studies on academic writing is not as extended as it is in English, and the doctoral thesis is not an exception. On the other hand, it has been pointed out from contrastive rhetoric and English for Academic Purposes studies that cross-cultural differences related to particular academic backgrounds are reflected in the rhetorical and linguistic organization of texts (Connor, 1996; Connor and Kaplan, 1987).

30|$|The {{concept of}} genre has been {{understood}} {{in a variety}} of ways in applied linguistics. Briefly speaking, the available definitions of genre have addressed it from three basic perspectives: textual regularity, social function and social context (Hyon, 1996). The perspective of textual regularity refers to the fact that texts belonging to the same genre can be recognized by their “shared structure, style, content and intended audience” (Swales, 1990, p. 58). English for academic purposes (EAP) research, for instance, has paid special attention to structural move analysis to detect functional units regulating the global organizational patterns and content of different genres. The perspective of social function is mainly addressed by new rhetoric scholars’ discussions of the relationship between text types and rhetorical situations (Coe, 2002) and Swales’ (1990, 2004) conceptualization of “communicative purpose”. This perspective suggests that genres are not merely collections of identifiable texts, but also textual schema we rely upon to create meanings that make sense to our intended audience. Finally, the perspective of social context describes the settings that different genres are situated in, with concepts such as “discourse community” (<b>Swales,</b> <b>1990,</b> <b>2004)</b> being proposed to depict the socio-rhetorical assemblages of people, who, gathered by shared occupational or recreational goals, develop different genres for within-group communications.|$|E
40|$|While {{the ability}} to present a written {{argument}} convincingly is important for tertiary level students, {{research has shown that}} the written argument {{is one of the most}} difficult written genres for students to master. In this regard, many studies have been conducted on this genre and it was found that one of the moves which students encountered the most difficulty with was the move which handled counter-arguments. Novice writers have been known to avoid this particular move even though skilled arguers are expected to demonstrate an ability to raise counter-arguments and quash them strategically in order to strengthen a chosen claim. This study applied the robust two-layer move-step approach popularised by <b>Swales</b> (<b>1990,</b> <b>2004)</b> to explore this particular move in argumentative essays. The qualitative analysis of this study included an examination of the linguistic features used by writers to communicate their intentions in this move and its subsequent steps. It was found that a move which handled counter-arguments might contain a combination of three steps and these were steps which raised a counter-argument, acknowledged the value of a counter-argument, and rejected a counter-argument. The findings of this study have pedagogical value because it can assist classroom practitioners in preparing teaching materials, particularly for a second language classroom at tertiary level...|$|E

40|$|Medical {{dictionaries}} represent, {{among the}} other things, an important pedagogic genre (Swales 1995, Bhatia, 1997, Hyland 2000) within academic education, since they are the means through which professional writers talk about their disciplines and address to scholars. The preface sections are {{of the utmost importance}} since, among several functions, they (should) attract and orient the readers (Azar, 2012). This paper describes the macro structure of preface sections in fourteen English dictionaries related to the field of medicine and investigates on the rhetorical and discursive devices employed in these texts to establish the importance of the author's work. In addition, the paper questions on the nature of dictionaries readership and, as such, addressing moves are analysed. The preface sections were extracted from the fourteen dictionaries published between 1719 and 1949 in order to assess the potential reader to whom these manuals are addressed and to identify the moves, the rhetorical and discursive devices that occur in the medical text prefaces. Move structure is analysed according to a taxonomy of categories adapted from <b>Swales</b> (<b>1990)</b> and Bhatia (1993). More importantly, results are studied within the historical context in which these dictionaries are published and within the medical advances that took place between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The study of medical dictionaries in terms of their generic structures and functions (<b>Swales,</b> <b>1990)</b> can be useful for researchers willing to understand how societal changes modify group-communities and their specific and generic knowledge...|$|R
40|$|The {{trend towards}} using English as an {{academic}} lingua franca has undoubtedly increased the awareness of a need for specific EAP writing instruction and inroads into researching student writing have been made. However, systematic improvements for a theory-informed teaching practice still require more detailed knowledge of {{the current state of}} student academic writing, which also takes into account local practices and requirements. Extended genre analysis provides such a means of researching student writing in specific settings. This is an innovative methodology which expands on English for Specific Purposes (ESP) genre analysis (cf. Bhatia, 1993, 2004; <b>Swales,</b> <b>1990,</b> <b>2004)</b> to systematically integrate corpus linguistic tools into the analysis and {{to take into account the}} special status of student genres. A special advantage of this methodology is that it can be applied easily and successfully to small-scale purpose-built corpora. This paper presents an application of extended genre analysis to a corpus of 55 student paper conclusions produced by non-native speakers in the initial phase of their studies. Findings suggest systematic differences in structure between student and expert genres, as well as a more complex set of differences in lexico-grammar, and especially the use of formulaic language, between research articles and non-native student papers. The implications of these findings as well as of the proposed methodology of corpus-based genre analysis for teaching practice are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePatents {{represent}} a critically important research genre in numerous {{scientific and technological}} fields, yet their rhetorical and other linguistic features remain underexplored relative {{to those of the}} related and much more extensively studied research article. While patents share many common elements with research articles, and sometimes even cover the exact same scientific discoveries as articles, they differ from articles in substantial ways, largely due to differences in their communicative purposes, their intended readerships, and the presence of significant legal constraints that govern many aspects of patent construction. Here, I present a comparative analysis of a corpus containing pairs of U. S. patents and published research articles covering equivalent scientific discoveries in the area of biotechnology. For this analysis, I have focused on the “Background of the Invention” section of the patents and the Introduction section of the research articles. Research article Introductions are perhaps the most widely studied of all sections of IMRAD-type articles, often displaying a rhetorical structure as described by Swales’s CARS model (<b>Swales,</b> <b>1990,</b> <b>2004).</b> While the Background section of patents may address similar scientific elements as article Introductions and may thus be expected to include aspects of the CARS model, the two sections often show fundamentally differences, including with respect to their rhetorical structures, the way in which cited work is addressed, and hedging. These differences, and their functional relations to the divergent communicative purposes of each genre, will be addressed...|$|E

The results of that analysis were used to determine the documents’ genre (text type) (<b>Swales</b> <b>1990,</b> <b>2004)</b> and register (language variety, whose variables are Field, Tenor, and Mode) (Halliday 1978). ^ The findings indicate that the texts are an identifiable genre, “university appointment document. ” Register characteristics include frequent expressions of obligation and certainty, passive constructions, few pronouns, and the “overwording” that is common in official discourse. The vocabulary is a mixture of the language of librarianship, higher education, and human resources (HR). ^ Recommendations include further research to extend the typology to other populations; exploration of models of academic staff status; examining what status is actually best for librarians in fulfilling the university mission; further discourse analysis to discover how the appointment documents reflect status types; and analysis of particular register characteristics.

40|$|Research in {{the area}} of {{academic}} writing has demonstrated that writing varies significantly across disciplines and among genres within disciplines. Two important approaches to studying diversity in disciplinary academic writing have been the genre-based approach and the corpus-based approach. Genre studies have considered the situatedness of writing tasks, including the larger sociocultural context of the discourse community (e. g., Berkenkotter 2 ̆ 6 Huckin, 1995; Bhatia, 2004) as well as the move structure in specific genres like the research article (e. g., <b>Swales,</b> <b>1990,</b> <b>2004).</b> Corpus- based studies of disciplinary writing have focused more closely on the linguistic variation across registers, with the re-search article being the most widely studied register (e. g., Cortes, 2004; Gray, 2011). Studies of under-graduate writing in the disciplines have tended to focus on task classification (e. g., Braine, 1989; Horowitz, 1986 a), literacy demands (e. g.,Carson, Chase, Gibson, 2 ̆ 6 Hargrove, 1992), or student development (e. g., Carroll, 2002; Leki, 2007). The {{purpose of the present study}} is to build on these previous lines of research to explore undergraduate disciplinary writing from multiple perspectives in order to better prepare English language learners for the writing tasks they might encounter in their majors at a US university. Specifically, this exploratory study examines two disciplines: psychology and chemistry. Through writing task classification (following Horowitz, 1986), qualitative interviews with faculty and students in each discipline, and a corpus-based text analysis of course readings and upper-division student writing, the study yielded several important findings. With regard to writing tasks, psychology writing tasks showed more variety than chemistry. In addition, lower division classes had fewer writing assignments than upper division courses, particularly in psychology. The findings also showed a mismatch between the expectations of instructors in each discipline and students’ understanding of such writing expectations. The linguistic analysis of course readings and student writing demonstrated differences in language use both between registers and across disciplines...|$|E
40|$|As English is {{the leading}} medium of {{communication}} in academia, publication in international journals presents a goal and a challenge for some non-Anglophone researchers. Researchers have compared research articles (RAs) in English and Spanish in order to discover whether the textual organisation in each language is similar or different, {{with the aim of}} assisting future scholars to achieve publication at the international level. However, intercultural studies of L 2 (English) are sadly small, especially studies focusing on the Introduction and Discussion sections which are known to be troublesome for novice writers. In Spain, researchers are compelled to present their academic contributions in international journals in order to gain international visibility. Therefore, the present study examines RAs in English and Spanish as well as RAs written in English by Spanish-background speakers in the fields of applied linguistics. It focuses on the Introduction and Discussion genre moves and steps. To do so, it draws on two theoretical frameworks, principally on move analysis (<b>Swales,</b> <b>1990,</b> <b>2004),</b> complemented by aspects of Appraisal theory (Martin & White, 2005) within Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL). Results of move analysis indicate that the English writers display a close adherence to the schemas of the Introduction and Discussion/Conclusion sections. The variations in move structure in the Spanish L 1 group suggest that the Spanish Introduction and Discussion/Conclusion genre shows hybrid interdiscursive patterns, and I suggest that this can be a sign of the globalisation of English-language academia. However, these writers have also resisted standardisation with the English register, as their texts also embody culturally-specific disciplinary practices. The English L 2 group appears to be learning to articulate these genres for international publications, thus accommodating the needs of a broader audience. Analysis using Appraisal theory, focusing on the engagement system reveals that these writers attain research legitimation (Hood, 2006; Van Leeuwen, 2007) by contracting resources to declare the need for more research in the Introduction section, and endorsing the validation of new knowledge in the Discussion/ Conclusion section. This study, by complementing the moves analysis with Appraisal theory provides pedagogical models for novice and second language writers to understand and/or produce research articles successfully...|$|E

Following the pedagogical implementation of genres presented by Ramos (2004), this article will present the perceptions {{of a group of}} students about their learning based on the notion of a genre in a teaching material prepared by the teacher-researcher for the teaching of reading. This material was developed based on the notions of genre by <b>Swales</b> (<b>1990)</b> and Bhatia (1993), as well as the pedagogical implementation of genres by Ramos (2004) and the Parâmetros Curriculares Nacionais - Língua Estrangeira (Brazilian National Curriculum Parameters for the Teaching of Foreign Languages – Elementary School, Brasil, 1998) ...|$|R

As an initial step, it reviews and critiques {{a series of}} in the relevant areas of intercultural communication, genre analysis and contrastive rhetoric and points {{out that it is}} imperative to explore what CCDC is composed of. In addition, we also need to strengthen cross-cultural genre study {{in the light of the}} sociocognitive perspective (Berger & Luckmann, 1966; 1995; Berkenkotter & Huckins, 1995; Paltridge, 1997; <b>Swales,</b> <b>1990).</b> Based on the relevant theoretical dimensions reviewed, this paper develops a model to measure CCDC embracing a range of concepts including genre prototype and cultural semantics followed by specific research methodologies for the implementation of the research model...|$|R
40|$|To {{analyze the}} inner {{structure}} of the scientific abstracts produced by students from the Economic and Social Sciences Program in their final report, according to APA norms is {{the objective of this}} paper. The theoretical works of <b>Swales</b> (<b>1990),</b> Hylland (2000) and Arribalzaga (2004), were the framework of this study under the paradigm of mixed research. The sample was constituted by 18 scientific abstracts, assessed by an observation chart. Data demonstrated the little importance given to the rhetorical movement constituted by the results, being the introduction of greater interest for the sample considered, reported by the 72 % of the abstracts examined. A set of methodological-theoretical outlines which will contribute to improve the redaction of such abstracts is proposed...|$|R
