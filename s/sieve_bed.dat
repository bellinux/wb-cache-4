Recently chloride stress corrosion cracking (SCC) was noted in the system piping.

40|$|A new {{experimental}} {{system has}} been developed for use of pure tritium amounting to 100 Ci at a time. The system consists of two experimental chambers and other components such as tritium storage-supply, gas purification, isotope separation, and exhaust gas handling devices. These components provide a complete tritium circulation in the system, and hence tritium waste can be minimized {{for a variety of}} experimental works. One of the chambers is designed for experiments using molecular tritium, and the other for tritium plasma generated with ECR discharge. A Zr-Ni alloy is applied for impurity removal from the exhaust gas from both of the experimental chambers and gas chromatography is used for the isotope separation of purified hydrogen isotope mixtures. Other kinds of gettering materials are used for tritium storage-supply. The exhaust gas handling system has two different devices; one is a conventional wet device, consisting of a Pt-catalyst bed and a molecular <b>sieve</b> <b>bed,</b> the other a dry device using two getter beds.

40|$|AbstractWater vapor in {{a natural}} gas stream can result in line {{plugging}} due to hydrate formation, reduction of line capacity due to collection of free water in the line, and increased risk of damage to the pipeline due to the corrosive effects of water. Therefore, water vapor must be removed from natural gas to prevent hydrate formation and corrosion from condensed water. Gas dehydration {{is the process of}} removing water vapor from a gas stream to lower the temperature at which water will condense from the stream; this temperature is called the “dew point” of the gas. Molecular sieves are considered {{as one of the most}} important materials that are used as desiccant materials in industrial natural gas dehydration. This work shows a study of natural gas dehydration using 3 A molecular sieve as a type of solid desiccant materials, the scope of this work was to build up a pilot scale unit for a natural gas dehydration as simulation of actual existing plant for Egyptian Western Desert Gas Company (WDGC). The effect of different operating conditions (water vapor concentration and gas flow rate) on dehydration of natural gas was studied. The experimental setup consists of cylinder filled with 3 A molecular sieve to form a fixed bed, then pass through this bed natural gas with different water vapor concentration, The experimental setup is fitted with facilities to control bed pressure, flow rate, measure water vapor concentration and bed temperature, a gas heater was used to activate molecular <b>sieve</b> <b>bed.</b> Increasing water vapor concentration in inlet feed gas leads to a marked decrease in dehydration efficiency.

Tritium losses to the environment from these operations are less than 1 ppm. All operations are performed in an inert gas-purged glovebox system vented to an effluent removal system which permits nearly complete removal of tritium from the exhaust gases prior to their dischardge to the environment. Waste oil and water from tritium processing areas are vacuum-transferred to glovebox storage tanks through double-walled lines. Accommodations are also available for emptying portable liquid waste containers and for removing tritiated water from molecular <b>sieve</b> <b>beds</b> with heat and vacuum. The tritium concentration of the collected liquids is measured by an in-line calorimeter. A low-volume metering pump is used to transfer liquids from holding tanks to heavy walled polyethylene drums filled with an absorbent or cement for solidification.

50|$|VSA {{differs from}} {{cryogenic}} distillation techniques of gas separation {{as well as}} pressure swing adsorption (PSA) techniques because it operates at near-ambient temperatures and pressures. VSA may actually be best described as {{a subset of the}} larger category of PSA. It differs primarily from PSA in that PSA typically vents to atmospheric pressures, and uses a pressurized gas feed into the separation process. VSA typically draws the gas through the separation process with a vacuum. For oxygen and nitrogen VSA systems, the vacuum is typically generated by a blower. Hybrid VPSA systems also exist. VPSA systems apply pressurized gas to the separation process and also apply a vacuum to the purge gas. VPSA systems, like one of the portable oxygen concentrators, are among the most efficient systems, measured on customary industry indices, such as recovery (product gas out/product gas in), productivity (product gas out/mass of sieve material). Generally, higher recovery leads to a smaller compressor, blower, or other compressed gas or vacuum source and lower power consumption. Higher productivity leads to smaller <b>sieve</b> <b>beds.</b> The consumer will most likely consider indices which have a more directly measurable difference in the overall system, like the amount of product gas divided by the system weight and size, the system initial and maintenance costs, the system power consumption or other operational costs, and reliability.|$|R
40|$|Tritium and {{deuterium}} {{are expected}} to be the fuel for the first fusion power reactors. Being radioactive, tritium is a health, safety and environment concern. Room air tritium clean systems can be used to handle tritium that has been lost to the room from primary or secondary containment. Such a system called the Experimental Tritium Cleanup (ETC) systems is installed at the Tritium Systems Test Assembly (TSTA) at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The ETC consists of (1) two compressors which draw air from the room, (2) a catalyst bed for conversion of tritium to tritiated water, and (3) molecular <b>sieve</b> <b>beds</b> for collection of the water. The exhaust from this system can be returned to the room or vented to the stack. As part of the US/Japan fusion collaboration, on two separate occasions, tritium was released into the 3000 m 3 TSTA test cell, and the ETC was used to handle these releases. Each release consisted of about one Curie of tritium. Tritium concentrations in the room were monitored at numerous locations. Also recorded were the HT and HTO concentrations at the inlet and outlet of the catalyst bed. Tritium surface concentrations in the test cell were measured before and at a series of times after the releases. Surfaces included normal test cell equipment as well as idealized test specimens. The results showed that the tritium became well-mixed in the test cell after about 45 min. When the ETC was turned on, the tritium in the TSTA test cell decreased exponentially as was expected. The test cell air tritium concentration was reduced to below one DAC (derived air concentration) in about 260 min. For the catalys...|$|R

40|$|The TFTR tritium {{operations}} {{staff has}} successfully received, stored, handled, and processed over five hundred thousand curies of tritium {{for the purpose}} of supporting D-T (Deuterium-Tritium) operations at TFTR. Tritium operations personnel nominally provide continuous round the clock coverage (24 hours/day, 7 days/week) in shift complements consisting of I supervisor and 3 operators. Tritium Shift Supervisors and operators are required to have 5 years of operational experience in either the nuclear or chemical industry and to become certified for their positions. The certification program provides formal instruction, {{as well as on the}} job training. The certification process requires 4 to 6 months to complete, which includes an oral board lasting up to 4 hours at which time the candidate is tested on their knowledge of Tritium Technology and TFTR Tritium systems. Once an operator is certified, the training process continues with scheduled training weeks occurring once every 5 weeks. During D-T operations at TFTR the operators must evacuate the tritium area due to direct radiation from TFTR D-T pulses. During `` time operators maintain cognizance over tritium systems via a real time TV camera system. Operators are able to gain access to the Tritium area between TFTR D-T pulses, but have been excluded from die tritium area during D-T pulsing for periods up to 30 minutes. Tritium operators are responsible for delivering tritium gas to TFRR as well as processing plasma exhaust gases which lead to the deposition of tritium oxide on disposable molecular <b>sieve</b> <b>beds</b> (DMSB).

40|$|In the summer/fall of 1996 {{after nearly}} three years of D-T operations, TFTR {{underwent}} an extended outage during which large port covers {{were removed from the}} vacuum vessel in order to complete upgrades to the tokamak. Following the venting of the torus, a three tier system was developed for the outage in order to reduce and control the free tritium in the vacuum vessel so as to minimize the exposure to personnel during port cover removal and reinstallation. The first phase of the program to reduce the free tritium consisted of direct flowthrough of room air through the vacuum vessel to the molecular <b>sieve</b> <b>beds</b> using the Torus Cleanup System. Real time measurements of the effluent tritium concentration were used to derive the amount of tritium removed from the torus. Once the free tritium in the vessel had been reduced to approximately 50 Ci, a second phase was initiated using a 55 Gallon Drum Bubbler System for the direct processing of the vacuum vessel to further lower the tritium level in the torus. Tritium oxide is absorbed by the bubbler system with the exhaust vented to one of the tritium monitored HVAC ventilation stacks. To preclude the release of tritium to the Test Cell location of TFTR and to minimize the exposure of workers, a variable flow exhaust system was employed in order to maintain a negative pressure in the vacuum vessel between 0. 05 " and 1. 5 " w. c. during the removal of port covers ranging in size from approximately 5 to 1000 in(superscript 2). These systems were completely successful in reducing and controlling the free tritium in TFTR and were instrumental in maintaining ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) exposures to tritium during the 1996 outage. These systems are again being utilized during the safe shutdown and decommissioning of TFTR which commenced in April of 1997. This paper describes in detail the configuration of these systems and the data obtained during the outage and safe shutdown of TFTR...|$|R

This method ignores real-time bed fill level knowledge, which could potentially lead to an overflow. A MATLAB code was written to compute the amount tritiated water accumulated in the beds.

This study assessed brown and rainbow trout spawning habitat quality using grain-size distributions, pebble counts and <b>sieve</b> analyses, <b>bed</b> mobility estimates, painted tracers and shear stress, and secondary discharge data in the Bear River, from Combie Reservoir to the Wolf Creek confluence in the Sierra Nevada Foothills of California. Median diameters of potential spawning sediment in three of seven sediment samples were within the optimal size range for spawning (D 50, 15 - 30 mm), however, spawning sediment was limited in the selected representative study reach. Bed mobility estimates indicated fine sediment transport (< 10 mm) and immobility of potential spawning sediment (D 50, 15 - 30 mm), suggesting optimal trout spawning habitat conditions. Analysis of average monthly discharge in the Bear River from 2010 to 2013 indicated that flow conditions for brown and rainbow trout spawning are within the optimal range (0. 27 to 56 cms), as defined by trout water velocity requirements and study site geometry. For both brown and rainbow trout spawning habitat quality, less than optimal conditions were determined for sediment size and availability. Increasing upstream discharge may increase spawning habitat availability by bank inundation during critical trout spawning months, however, sediment quantity and quality was the limiting issue.

They can produce as much as 1. 2 E 6 SCFH 02 and 4. 5 SCFH N 2 (not coincidently) with a peak product efficiency of 85 - 86 % (product to total Intake). The general area demand has been as high as 10 E 6, as low as 4. 5 E 6, and is currently 8 E 6 SCFH totaI product. The plant is really four plants in one. At anyone time one or more plants can be down for maintenance and the others online and delivering to the pipe line that distributes their product to nearby steel plants, and to the liquid reservoirs (perlite insulated tanks) of 160, 160 and 200 E 6 SCF. At {{the time of our}} visit two plants were down and two were on line. The following describes the characteristics of one of the four plants. The cycle requires a base compressor (Brown Boveri, 22, 600 hp) that pumps to 90 - 100 psig, and a booster compressor (Clark, 14, 000 hp) that pumps to 300 psig. Filter houses (ca. 20 -ft x 20 -ft) feed the suctions and the discharge is scrubbed by dual, molecular <b>sieve,</b> <b>beds</b> 0 300 psi (6 - 8 hour cycle time). The beds are provided with dust blow down and down stream filter provisions. The scrubbers remove CO 2, the heavy HC, and water. The effectiveness of the scrubbers is measured by the record 6 years one of the plants ran w/o the need for thawing. The thaw operation takes about 4 days. It was interesting to learn that a plant can be brought on line in two and one half hours from a warm start. Major swings from N 2 rich to O 2 rich production take about an hour. Argon is a small constituent in air (0. 61) and thus not a major product. It comes off the main column at 761 Ar balance air components and is further purified in another column to 2 % N 2, 2 % O 2. The stream is then warmed, H 2 added, and run though a palladium deoxo to combine the O 2 to water. The water is removed in a dryer and the product reliquified to seperate the nitrogen. The final product is either drawn off and pumped to storage, or, in the case of case of the high purity product, pressure transfered directly from the final column to a properly cooled and purged truck backed right up to the column. The high purity product can be as low as 0. 3 ppm 02 by proper application of these procedures. Liquid Argon is the only product for which standing, loaded, trailers are provided vent recovery lines. The recovered gas is fed back to the crude Ar stream. The local O 2 monitoring equipment is a Teledyne 306 WA with ranges of 1, 10, 100 and 1000 PPM full scale.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Development and Management Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. According to Oliver (2002) {{the success}} of {{turnaround}} maintenances is {{measured in terms of}} the cost of completion, time, safety performance and the performance of the plant afterwards. The Escravos gas plant (EGP) is a gas processing plant that converts associated gas from Chevron owned crude oil wells to liquefied petroleum gas, natural gas and gas condensate (Chevron intranet. Website assessed on September 14, 2007). According to the EGP plant operations coordinator (See interview Appendix A), the plant undergoes a turnaround maintenance exercise once every two years. The major tasks done during these turnaround maintenances are 1. Change–out of three molecular <b>sieve</b> <b>beds.</b> 2. Servicing of three compressor turbines. 3. Servicing of expander turbo–machinery. 4. Clean–out of fired gas heater tubes and burners. 5. Tie–ins for major upgrades. The EGP management does not involve the contractor personnel that carry out the tasks in the management of the turnaround maintenance. The contractor’s personnel simply follow the work plans and instructions developed by the EGP management. The EGP turnaround management team consists of the coordinator who {{is the head of the}} turnaround maintenance team, shift supervisors, maintenance supervisors (rotating equipment maintenance supervisor, instrumentation and electrical maintenance supervisor, and static equipment maintenance supervisors), safety supervisors, maintenance planners, process engineers and construction supervisors. All these listed personnel in the preceding paragraph and the supervisors of the contractor teams participate in the pre–turnaround meetings which happen once a month for the first 10 months of the 12 months leading to the turnaround. The meeting frequency increases to once every two weeks during the last two months leading to the turnaround maintenance. The meeting is held daily during the turnaround maintenance and once every two weeks for the first month after the turnaround maintenance. During the preceding months to the turnaround maintenance, the work scope is defined, the job sequence outlined and schedules are developed. Resources requirements are detailed and procured. During the turnaround maintenance the focus of the turnaround meeting is to discuss potential deviations, observe at–risk behaviors and likely challenges. Plans are then made to address these deviations, challenges and at–risk behaviors. After the turnaround maintenance, “lessons learnt” are captured and the turnaround maintenance is closed out. According to the EGP coordinator (see interview in appendix A), {{the success of}} its turnaround maintenance is measured by the time used to complete the turnaround maintenance, the total recordable incident rate during the turnaround maintenance, the days away from work, the lost time injury(LTI) and the cost incurred. Poling et al noted that it is difficult to rate turnaround maintenance projects because no two turnaround maintenances strategies are exactly the same. They iterated that the most common tactics used is benchmarking and that benchmarking enables a company to measure and compare its performance against peer companies in a constructive and confidential manner. They pointed out that the quantitative differences computed between a plant and other similar plants using detailed data taxonomy can provide invaluable information regarding improvement opportunities. This is a way of effectively extending a “lessons learned” exercise across multiple companies. According to then however a critical attribute of effective reliability and maintenance benchmarking is the ability to compare disparate assets; but even small differences for similar plants can alter the value of the comparison. Existing literature indicate that the parameters the gas plant management use to rate the safety of its turnaround maintenance (i. e. the total recordable incident rate, the days away from work and the lost time injury) are reactive in nature. They are otherwise called lagging indicators. Lagging indicators are safety performance metrics that are recorded after the accident or incidents has occurred. For example lost time injury is any work related injury or illness which prevents that person from doing any work day after accident (E&P Consultancy Associates. Website assessed on June 15, 2009). In contrast the other group of metrics called pro–active metrics or leading indicators such as at–risk behaviors, near misses and preventive maintenance not completed are parameters that measure safety performance before accident occurs. Leading indicators gained popularity in the 1930 ’s after Heinrich postulate his iceberg theory (Wright, 2004). Heinrich’s used the iceberg analogy to explain reactive (lagging) and proactive (leading) indicators. Heinrich likened accident and at–risk behaviors to two parts of an Iceberg; the part you see above water and the part hidden under the water. The size of the iceberg above water is relatively small compared to that under water. The iceberg starts to grow under the water and only after they reach a certain size does part of the ice begin to appear above water. Heinrich believed that accidents are the result of root causes such as at–risk behaviors, inconsistencies, wrong policies, lack of training and lack of information. When the number of accidents that occur in an endeavor is measured you get relatively smaller numerical quantities when compared to the number of at–risk behaviors. Heinrich suggested that to eliminate accidents that occur infrequently, organizations must make effort to eliminate the root causes which occur very frequently. This makes sense because imagine a member of personnel coming to work intoxicated every day. Binging intoxicated at work is an at–risk behavior. The employee is very likely to be involved in an accident at some time as a result of his drinking habit. The number of times he is intoxicated if counted will be huge when compared to the impact of the accident when it does occur. The iceberg theory is supported by work from Bird (1980) and Ludwig (1980) who both attempted to establish the correct ratio of accidents to root causes in different industries. Heinrich suggested a ratio of three hundred incidents to twenty nine minor injuries to one major injury. This researcher chose to use the number of at–risk behavior exhibited by the turnaround maintenance teams to rate the safety performance of tasks despite criticism from individuals like Robotham (2004) who said that from his experience minor incidents do not have the potential to become major accidents and Wright et al (2004). Leading indicators are convenient to analysis because of their relative large quantity. In a turnaround environment, the numbers of accidents that occur are relatively few unlike the number of near misses (Bird, 1980). It is easy to statistically analyze thirty at–risk behaviors than four accidents. In addition Fleming et al (2001) noted that data from industry show much success by companies in the reduction of accidents by efforts at reducing the number of at–risk behaviors, increase the number of safety audits, and reduce the number of closed items from audits etc. Phimister et al made similar claims when they said Near miss programs improve corporate environmental, health and safety performance through the identification of near misses. Existing literature also reveals many theories about management styles and their possible impact on performance. The theories are grouped into trait theories, situational theories and behavioral theories. The trait theories tries to explain management styles by traits of the managers like initiative, wisdom, compassion and ambitious. Situational theories suggest that there is no best management style and managers will need to determine which management style best suit the situation. Behavioral theories explain management success by what successful managers do. Behavioral theorists identify autocratic, benevolent, consultative and participatory management styles. Vroom and Yetton (1973) identified variables that will determine the best management style for any given situation. The variables are; 1. Nature of the problem. Is it simple, hard, complex or clear? 2. Requirements for accuracy. What is the consequence of mistakes? 3. Acceptance of an initiative. Do you want people to use their initiative or not? 4. Time–constraints. How much time do we have to finish the task? 5. Cost constraints. Do we have enough or excess to achieve the objective? A decision model was developed by Vroom and Yago (1988) to help managers determine the best management style for different situations based on the variables listed above (See figure six). They also defined five management style could adopt, namely the; 1. Autocratic I style 2. Autocratic II style. 3. Consultative I style 4. Consultative II style 5. Group II style The autocratic I management style is a management style where the leader solves the problem alone using information that is readily available to him/her, is the normal management style of the Escravos gas plant management in all turnarounds prior to 2009. However the Vroom and Yago model recommends the Consultative II management style for the type of work done during the Escravos gas plant turnaround maintenance. According to Coye et al (1995), participatory management or consultative style II creates a sense of ownership in organization. In this management style the leader shares problem with group members individually, and asks for information and evaluation. Group members do not meet collectively, and leader makes decision alone (Vroom and Yago, 1988). Coye et al believe that this management styles instills a sense of pride and motivate employees to increase productivity. In addition they stated that employees who participate in the decisions of the organization|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The {{protection}} of water quality {{and the maintenance of}} productive anadromous fisheries is a primary concern in the Pacific Northwest. Excessive suspended sediment loads is a principle water quality problem on small wildland watersheds in this region (Anderson, 1971; Brown, 1972). Man's activities have been shown to increase sedimentation rates in some cases (Burns, 1970; Megahan, 1972). However, {{more research is needed to}} define the basic sedimentation processes and factors before adequate assessments of man's impacts can be determined on a broad basis. This paper presents the results of a study of the suspended sediment regimes for two small mountain watersheds located in Oregon's Coast Range. Suspended sediment concentrations in these kinds of watersheds are typically variable over short time spans. In- channel sources of fine sediment, particularly sediment stored in the bed gravels of armored stream segments, may be a major factor influencing the sediment regimes of these watersheds. A The primary objective of the study was to characterize the temporal variability in suspended sediment concentration on the two watersheds. In addition, nephelometric and gravimetric sampling procedures and the potential contributions of in-channel sources of suspended sediment were evaluated on the Oak Creek watershed. The temporal variability in suspended sediment concentration during storm events and on a seasonal basis was determined using intensive automatic and manual sampling procedures. <b>Sieve</b> analysis of <b>bed</b> material composition and channel profile measurements were utilized to define the potential availability of suspendable material within the channel systems. It was found that : (1) Stream bed gravels are a significant potential source area of suspendable material. (2) A decline in the suspended sediment concentration in the stream channel at a given flow occurs during the falling stage of individual runoff events and with successive events over the winter runoff season. This phenomenon can best be described as a flushing process, where the depletion of suspendable sediments may be associated with the successive release and capture of fine material by the bed armor layer. (3) Sampling of sediment concentration did not appear to be significantly influenced by horizontal concentration gradients. However, vertical concentration gradients, particularly in the transition zone between suspended load and bed load, did prove to be significant.

At this temperature the tar is more brittle and weaker than the sand. Thus, the tar is liberated from the sand and ground to fine particles, which can {{be separated from the}} sand. The technical performance of this process was studied, and a general grinding and liberation model was developed, which simulates this and other two component grinding processes.;Four grinding/separation techniques were studied: Fluidized Bed Grinder (a stirred fluidized bed with steel balls) and Spouted Bed grinding combined with tar entrainment, and High Speed Impeller and Ball Mill grinding combined with <b>sieving.</b> The spouted <b>bed</b> gave the highest quality of separation, with a tar purity of 84 %, at a tar recovery of 90 %. The ball mill gave the lowest separation quality with a tar purity of 60 % at 80 % tar recovery, and 35 % at 90 % recovery. A maximum tar recovery of 94 %, at a tar purity of 65 %, was obtained in the fluidized bed grinder. The spouted bed gave the lowest rate of separation, with a typical processing time of 14 hours to obtain 90 % tar recovery, versus 2 - 7 hours for the other mills. However, proposed modifications should increase this rate substantially.;In the grinding and liberation model, a distinction is made between tar sand agglomerates, containing more than one sand grain, and single sand particles, coated with a thin tar layer. Grinding of each particle type is described by a set of conventional first order rate equations, although with non-normalized breakage distribution functions for the agglomerates. The processes are interconnected by a continuous transfer of agglomerate grinding products to the tar coated sand particles. The simultaneous attrition of the tar layer on the sand particles is described by a fourth order rate equation, {{as a function of the}} remaining tar.;Simulation, using this model and experimentally determined parameters, gave an excellent agreement with measured size distributions (from 63 - 2000 (mu) m) and tar concentrations (as a function of particle size and processing time), and provided substantial insight into the various tar sand separation experiments...|$|R
