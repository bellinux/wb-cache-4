The data are collected from classroom observation, interview, and reading comprehension test. This study reveals several steps in implementing the <b>story</b> <b>map</b> while learning narrative text: (1) the introduction to story map; (2) filling each element of story map; and (3) discussion and reviewing.

40|$|Although <b>story</b> <b>mapping</b> {{strategy}} {{has been shown to}} be beneficial in many reading comprehension classes, the benefits of this technique have not been thoroughly investigated in L 2 writing research. The small number of previous studies (e. g., Li, 2007; Brunner, 2010) have found the potential benefits of using <b>story</b> <b>mapping</b> strategy on students ‟ writing performance, but they did not focus on different aspects of students ‟ writing. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating the effect of <b>story</b> <b>mapping</b> strategy on writing performance of EFL learners in terms of writing components (i. e., organization, content, grammar, mechanics, and style). After administering a standard proficiency test (OPT), 30 out of a pile of 82 Iranian EFL learners all majoring English teaching were selected and assigned to two groups: one experimental group and one control group. Both experimental and control groups completed two thirty-minute composition writing tests, one as a pre-test and the other one as a post-test. The experimental group received four sessions of instruction on how to use <b>story</b> <b>mapping</b> strategy in writing personal narratives. The results of One-way ANOVA and post-hoc Scheffé test indicated that the experimental group, which used <b>story</b> <b>mapping</b> strategy, made more progress in their personal narrative writings.

50|$|Disgaea 2 {{is divided}} into 13 chapters. Each chapter begins with cut scenes to explain Adell's next mission. Players then take control of Adell in his {{hometown}} of Holt. The town serves as a gateway to <b>story</b> <b>maps,</b> side quests, the dark council, and the item world. At the beginning of each chapter, a new area is unlocked. Each area consists of multiple maps which must be beaten to advance to the next chapter. Talking to the gatekeeper of Holt will give players the option of exploring the new area or repeating any maps that have been beaten. Many maps also have cut scenes. Scenes {{at the beginning and end}} of each chapter cannot be skipped. The gameplay in Disgaea 2 builds directly upon that of Disgaea: Hour of Darkness; players control a party of characters to do battle on a 3D isometric grid map. The Item World game mode returns from Disgaea: Hour of Darkness. Players can select any item in the party's inventory and enter it. The levels within are randomly generated, and the difficulty of enemies depends on the item's rarity or power. There are two ways to descend through the Item World: by defeating all enemies on a given level, or by using exit portals located somewhere on each level. Special enemies, called Guardians, can be freed by defeating them, imparting certain benefits to the item, such as increased attack or defense values. Once they are freed, they can be moved between items freely. The further a player descends through a given item's Item World, the higher the stat bonuses it will receive.|$|E

English Education Program. Institute Islamic Collage (IAIN) Tulungagung. Advisor: Dr. Erna Iftanti, SS. M. Pd. Keywords : Effectiveness, <b>Story</b> <b>Mapping</b> Technique, Reading Comprehension Reading is one {{of skill}} in English that has the {{important}} role {{in teaching and learning}} English. From reading, people can get the information and knowledge from text. Thus, to get many informations and knowledge, students do not just read the text but they have to comprehend the text. Sometimes, to read the text the students find out some difficulties, like they feel bored. Therefore, the students do not like reading, they just read the text without knowing the content of the text. So, it is significant for the researcher to know the effectiveness of <b>Story</b> <b>Mapping</b> technique as proved to be effectively used toward the students reading comprehension. The use of <b>Story</b> <b>Mapping</b> will make students become like reading activity, comprehend the content of the text. Based on the explanation above, the researcher is interested to find out the effect of treatment by <b>Story</b> <b>Mapping</b> technique toward students’ reading comprehension of the eight grade at SMPN 2 Sumbergempol in academic year 2015 / 2016. The problem proposed in this study is : Is <b>Story</b> <b>Mapping</b> effective toward students’ reading comprehension of the eight grade students at SMPN 2 Sumbergempol in academic year 2015 / 2016 ? The purpose of the study is intended to know the effectiveness of <b>Story</b> <b>Mapping</b> technique toward students’ reading comprehension of the eight grade students at SMPN 2 Sumbergempol in academic year 2015 / 2016. Research method : 1) the research uses pre-experimental design using quantitative approach with one group pre-test and post-test. 2) The population of this study was all students of are all of eight grade students of SMPN 2 Sumbergempol which consist of eight class (A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H) the sample was VIII D class consisting of 20 students. 4) The research instrument used is a test. 5) The data analysis was using T test. The result showed that the student’s mean score in teaching reading before getting treatment is 71. 10. While the student’s score after getting treatment is 82. 60. ”. At the significance level of 0. 05, the score of ttable is 2. 093. By comparing the “t” that the researcher has got calculation tcount is 5. 205 and the value of “t” on the ttable in significant level 0. 05 is 2. 093. It is known that tcount is bigger than ttable (5. 205 > 2. 093). Because the tcount is bigger than ttable the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is accepted and the null hypothesis (H 0) is rejected, it means that there is any significant difference on reading comprehension score before and after being taught by using <b>Story</b> <b>Mapping</b> technique.
