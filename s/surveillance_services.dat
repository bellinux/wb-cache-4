25|$|After {{the end of}} the war, the {{fisheries}} <b>surveillance</b> <b>services</b> were reorganized. A number of whaling ships which had participated in the Arctic convoys were put into use as surveillance vessels while the navy focused on minesweeping. The surveillance was supplemented with Flower-class corvettes. Three used River-class frigates were taken into use in 1956, allowing Nordkapp to be decommissioned in 1956 and Senja two years later. The corvettes and later the frigates were used both for fisheries inspection and held in readiness for war. They, therefore, incurred high operational costs, were inefficient and had a large degree of conscripts.|$|E
25|$|Israel {{is among}} the few {{countries}} capable of launching satellites into orbit and locally designed and manufactured satellites have been produced and launched by Israel Aerospace Industries(IAI), Israel's largest military engineering company, {{in cooperation with the}} Israel Space Agency. The AMOS-1 geostationary satellite began operations in 1996 as Israel's first commercial communications satellite. It was built primarily for direct-to-home television broadcasting, TV distribution and VSAT services. AMOS-2 was launched in December 2003 and a further series of AMOS communications satellites (AMOS 2 – 5i) are operated or in development by the Spacecom Satellite Communications company, headquartered in Ramat-Gan, Israel. Spacecom provides satellite telecommuncations services to countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Another satellite, the Gurwin-II TechSAT, designed and manufactured by the Technion, was launched in July 1998 to provide communications, remote sensing and research services. EROS, launched in 2000, is a non-geostationary orbit satellite for commercial photography and <b>surveillance</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E

50|$|An ABEP is {{basically}} composed by an intake and an electric thruster: rarefied gases which {{are responsible for}} drag in LEO and VLEO (Low and Very Low Earth Orbit), are used as the propellant. This technology would ideally allow S/Cs to fly at very low orbits without the need of on-board propellant, allowing longer time missions in a new section of atmosphere’s altitudes. This advantage makes the technology of interest for scientific missions as well as military and civil <b>surveillance</b> <b>services.</b> A special intake {{will be used to}} collect the gas molecules and direct them to the thruster while maintaining their velocity and pressure. The molecules will then be ionized by the thruster and expelled from the nozzle at a very high velocity, generating thrust. The electric power needed can be provided by the same power subsystems developed for the actual electric propulsion systems, likely a combination of solar arrays and batteries, though other kind of electric power subsystems can be considered. An ABEP could extend the lifetime of satellites in LEO and VLEO by compensating the atmospheric drag during their time of operation. The optimal altitude for an Earth-orbiting ABEP is approximately 200 km. This technology could also be utilized on other planets with atmosphere, such as Mars.|$|E

40|$|Background The {{national}} surgical site infection (SSI) <b>surveillance</b> <b>service</b> in England collates and publishes SSI {{rates that}} are used for benchmarking and to identify the prevalence of SSIs.

Aim To audit SSI definitions and data collection methods used by hospital trusts in England. Method All 156 hospital trusts in England were sent questionnaires that focused on aspects of SSI definitions and data collection methods. Findings Completed questionnaires were received from 106 hospital trusts. There were considerable differences in data collection methods and data quality that caused wide variation in reported SSI rates. For example, the SSI rate for knee replacement surgery was 4. 1...|$|R
