These systems were expected to exhibit improved absorbent capabilities in water and in an aqueous saline solution (compared to conventional <b>superabsorbents).</b> By encapsulating uncrosslinked hydrophilic polymers (guar, sodium polyacrylate) with different shell materials (polycyanoacrylate, polyvinylbutyral, crosslinked polyacrylate) it was impossible to generate stable swellable core/shell systems. By embedding sodium chloride into crosslinked sodium polyacrylate so-called osmotic <b>superabsorbents</b> were synthesized. These systems were capable of taking up water not only in form of a swollen polyacrylate gel, but (as a consequence of the osmotic effect of the embedded salt) also in form of an aqueous saline solution in the interior of the particles. Furthermore, by embedding hollow glass spheres into crosslinked sodium polyacrylate <b>superabsorbents</b> were obtained which could take up additional free water between the glass spheres and the polyacrylate matrix.

The influence of the substrate properties with hydrogels added was compared to the control combinations without hydrogels. The following properties were determined in the study combinations: total content of organic matter, substrate reaction, volumetric density, specific surface, porosity and percentage of solid phase. Air and water properties and water-air ratio were determined {{by means of the}} pF curve. Applicability of <b>superabsorbents</b> as components of horticultural substrates was also evaluated. In all the studied substrates a more favourable structure was achieved after hydrogel has been added. Alcosorb 400 and Akrygel RP introduced to the substrates has positively influenced their physical properties, considerably increasing retention of water available for plants. They also caused an increase in the specific surface especially in the substrate with perlit and an increase in the pH value in the mixture of peat and bark and peat and perlit. An increase in the applied hydrogel doses from 2 to 6 kg m- 3 of the substrate improved substrate properties when compared to the control combinations where <b>superabsorbents</b> were not applied. The results obtained showed that it is feasible to apply hydrogels as additions to horticultural substrates as the effects achieved proved that the most favourable conditions for plant development and growth can be created in that way...|$|R

40|$|Polymeric hydrogels is a {{class of}} scientifically {{interesting}} materials that are being extensively studied. They are found in numerous applications within; drug delivery, hygiene products, food industry, analytical chemistry, etc. In addition, polymeric hydrogels have promising future applications as; cell scaffolds, implants, sensors, etc. One of the critical parameters {{for the performance of}} hydrogels in different applications is their structure. One such structural feature is the heterogeneity of the material, where the term heterogeneity applies to many different types of structural variations. The aim of this thesis was to investigate how different kinds of heterogeneities can be introduced into hydrogels, and how the presence of the different heterogeneities can be related to swelling and mechanical properties of such materials. The materials investigated were; polyacrylic acid neutralized with calcium hydroxide, polysodium acrylate <b>superabsorbents</b> with microfibrillated cellulose utilized as a filler and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose with heterogeneous distribution of the substituents. It was found that the presence of calcium ions during the synthesis of crosslinked polyacrylic acid introduces heterogeneities, both in network structure and in the form of phase separation, with dramatic impact on gel properties. Microfibrillated cellulose was found to even in small amounts cause significant changes to the swelling and shear modulus of crosslinked polysodium acrylate <b>superabsorbents.</b> The effect of the microfibrillated cellulose was similar as if an equivalent mass of covalent crosslinker had been used, but with improved resistance to fracture. For hydroxypropyl methylcellulose it was found that a heterogeneous distribution of the substituents causes increased interactions within the material, as determined from the glass transition temperature. Those increased interactions are coherent with earlier reports on solution behaviour for heterogeneously substituted hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. Hopefully the results presented in this thesis can contribute to the field of gel science, and in particular to the design of new multi-component soft materials...|$|R

Disposable diaper producers also were early to convert to fluff pulp because of its low cost and high absorbency. Normal usage of fluff pulp in a diaper was about 55 grams. In the 1980s started the commercialization of air-laid paper, which gave better bulk, porosity, strength, softness and water absorption properties compared with normal tissue paper. Also in the 1980s started the use of <b>superabsorbents</b> in diapers and reduced the need for fluff pulp and is now down to 15 grams or even less.

Never-dried bleached kraft pulp was treated with TEMPO-oxidation, and new carboxylate and aldehyde groups were introduced. It was found that the aldehyde groups contributed to the wet integrity of the absorbent materials, possibly by the formation of hemiacetal bonds. After oxidation, the pulp fibers were gradually disintegrated, and size analysis showed that the disintegration rate was enhanced by an increase in the charge of the oxidant. Freeze drying produced a porous foam with a large surface area that enabled a rapid absorption rate as well as a reasonably high absorption capacity even for absorption under load.

Although much research has been published in recent years, the kinetics of water absorption and the swelling behavior of starch based <b>superabsorbents</b> are relatively unexplored. Also, water retention under mechanical strain is usually not reported. Cassava starch was used since it has considerable economic potential in Asia. The gelatinized starch was grafted with acrylic acid and Fenton’s initiator and crosslinked with N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide (MBAM). Besides a good initial absorption capacity, the product could retain up to 63 g H 2 O/g under severe suction. The material thus combines a good absorption capacity with sufficient gel strength. The mathematical analysis of the absorption kinetics shows that at conditions of practical interest, the rate of water penetration into the gel is determined by polymer chain relaxations and not by osmotic driven diffusion. ...|$|R

The swelling and de-swelling processes were described by first-order kinetics. The SAPs exhibited varied swelling capacity for crosslinkers of the same functionality as well as different functionality. The SAPs were used to adsorb the dye Orange G at different initial concentrations of the dye. The equilibrium adsorption data followed the Langmuir adsorption isotherms.

Homogenous acid-catalysed esterification of acrylic acid (AA) with 2 -ethylhexanol (2 EH) is commonly used for the production of 2 EHA. The homogeneous catalysts such as sulfuric and para-toluene sulfonic acid have resulted the costly and complicated downstream process that generates acidic, corrosive and non-environmental friendly waste. Therefore, it is importance to develop a cheaper process that employing heterogeneous catalysts and alternative raw material from wastewater containing acrylic acid.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1983 Modern {{forestry}} practices now {{include the use}} of many controlled release products, such as herbicides, pesticides fertilizers, <b>superabsorbents,</b> growth stimulants and animal repellents. Optimal use of these devices requires models that predict desirable release kinetics. Although some {{progress has been made in}} the development of empirical relationships between environmental data and pesticide persistence in soils, no workers have attempted to develop such models from first principles. Such a model is constructed in this study, and the model predictions are tested by comparison with the field results obtained following application of a slow release systemic repellent to tree seedlings. This deterrent device was designed in the study as an alternative to the chemical and mechanical protectants now available to prevent animal damage to tree seedlings. Selenium, the active agent, is absorbed through the tree's roots, transported to the foliage and thereafter volatilized as dimethyl selenide. This compound is the material responsible for the bad breath of humans who have eaten garlic, which is rich in the element. Eighty percent reduction of browse damage has been achieved by treatment of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) seedlings with low-solubility selenium tablets. Foliage samples collected at various field trial sites treated with the tablets provide data with which to test the model of active agent transport through the soil/plant system. The success achieved in the prediction of foliar selenium content as a function of time demonstrates that it is possible to apply fundamental chemical engineering principles to this complex system. Thus it is now possible to use these concepts to engineer other controlled release delivery systems for applications in both forestry and agriculture, in which the essential physics of the transport process should be identical...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{synthesize}} a new type of material, superporous hydrogel, and to explore its potential applications. Superporous hydrogels have numerous supersize pores inside them, and the typical pore sizes are several hundred micrometers. These unique structures give them distinctive properties from the traditional non-porous hydrogels and the macroporous hydrogels (pore size of several micrometers). ^ Superporous hydrogels were prepared by a gas blowing method. The crosslinking polymerization occurred when the foam was stabilized so that the pores were permanently captured in the polymer matrix. Various types of superporous hydrogels were synthesized in this study. ^ Superporous hydrogels can be used in various applications. In this study, four applications were explored. The first one was to make fast swelling <b>superabsorbents.</b> In aqueous solution, superporous hydrogels swelled several times larger and hundreds of times faster than the conventional non-porous hydrogels. The key factors for the fast swelling were well connected capillary channels and good polymer surface wettability. Ethanol dehydration, moistening, wetting agent, and superdisintegrants all improved the swelling rate of superporous hydrogels. The second application was to make degradable superporous hydrogels. Sucrose based superporous hydrogels were synthesized and they showed several times faster degradation than the non-porous hydrogels. The third application of superporous hydrogels was in the controlled drug delivery. Gastric retentive superporous hydrogels were synthesized for sustained oral drug delivery. The dosage forms had a small dry size, a large swollen size, a fast swelling time, strong mechanical properties, and were retained in the stomach for up to 4. 5 h in the fasted dog and up to 27 h in a dog that was fed in the first 6 h after the administration of the dosage form but was fasted thereafter. Factors attributed to the fast swelling and strong mechanical properties were studied. The fourth application was to make fast responsive thermo-reversible superporous hydrogels. They responded to the environmental temperature changes within 1 ∼ 2 min, while the non-porous hydrogels took hours. ...|$|R

40|$|Today a {{range of}} {{materials}} are used in medical applications; such materials are collectively denoted as biomaterials. A special class of biomaterials currently given much scientific interest is hydrogels. In particular a contemporary research topic is to create multicomponent materials in which synergetic effects are achieved. The works this thesis is based on aimed to create new potential multicomponent hydrogel biomaterials, where the presented materials {{can be divided into}} three groups: <b>superabsorbents</b> (SAPs), films with tuneable permeability and systems with inducible gelation. The materials were characterized with regard to macroscopically observed properties of importance for material performance. Based on observed properties, components in the materials and material structures conclusions were drawn about important structural design characteristics. Polyacrylic acid (PAA) based SAPs, in which microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) was used as a filler material, were synthesized. For the investigated SAPs some MFC was found to be equivalent to the same mass of traditional crosslinker with regard to modifying equilibrium swelling and shear modulus. Furthermore, the resistance to fracture upon compression was improved for MFC containing gels. Films composed of MFC and the water soluble polymer hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) were prepared. The water permeability of the films displayed a dependence on HPMC content opposite of what is commonly expected. The films exhibited large, close to one-dimensional, swelling. Also, films composed of crosslinked polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS) and carbomer micro particles (PAA based) or sucrose were synthesized. The permeability of water vapour through those films was tuneable by the addition of carbomer, but not by addition of sucrose. This was explained by that the swollen carbomer retained open channels with high diffusion in the films. In contrast, the highly elastic and hydrophobic PDMS probably sealed the pores left by dissolved sucrose. Gels based on nanocapsules of carboxymethyl-hexanoyl chitosan (CHC) with in situ gelling capability were found to have properties making them highly promising for biomedical, and in particular drug delivery applications. Hopefully the presented materials will act as inspiration for structural design, contribute to the understanding of structure-properties correlations and perhaps even contribute to improvement of people’s quality of life through new products reaching the market...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} two {{different}} examples of water absorbtion in polymers are studied by MonteCarlo simulations. Both {{of them are}} of large technical and commercial impotance. The firstexample is the water absorption in polyethylene cables where the water absorption plays acrucial role in the degradation of the cable insulation and thus should be as low as possible. The second example is bio-based <b>superabsorbents</b> made from denatured protein where waterabsorption capability is the prime desired property. MethodsGibbs Ensemble Monte Carlo simulations [1] were used to study the hydration of polymers. All simulations are performed with two boxes, {{one of which is}} filled with water at the start ofthe simulation, whereas the other contains polymer molecules and possible ions. The polymermolecules are not allowed to swap boxes whereas the water molecules are allowed to do sothus constituting an osmotic Gibbs ensemble [2]. For the polyethylene a connectivity-alteringalgorithm was used whereas the protein molecules were simulated using a side-chainregrowth model in addition to traditional Monte Carlo moves. For the polyethylene, theTraPPE [3] force field was used and the protein molecules, the Amber force field [4] wasused. Water was modelled using simple point charge models [5]. Electrostatic interactions aretreated using Ewald summation methods. The protein molecules were of different amino acidcompositions and in different conformations, e. g., β-turns and random coils obtained usingthe amorphous cell method[6]. Studies were made with different degrees of charging on, e. g.,lysine side chains mimicking different ionization states. ResultsThe studies of polyethylene revealed the importance of ions left from the polymerisationcatalyst for the absorbtion of water and the concomitant degradation of polyethylene cableinsulation. Also the absorption properties of the protein molecules is strongly related to thepresence of charged groups and fully charged protein molecules absorb large amounts ofwater. However, neither native nor denatured protein molecules show superabsorbingproperties (i. e. absorbing hundreds of times their own mass) as they show in experimentalstudies and the reasons for this discrepancy will be discussed.
