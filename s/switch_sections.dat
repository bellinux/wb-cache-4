Due {{to the fact that}} SF 6 is a greenhouse gas with a very high global warming potential, alternatives have been searched for over the last years. This paper presents the fundamental insulation characteristics of SF 6 /N 2 mixtures(50 % SF 6 _ 50 %N 2, 20 %SF 6 _ 80 %N 2) in sphere-plane and rod-plane configurations. The electrode gap spacing and the relative gas pressure were varied within the range of 10 ~ 50 mm and of 3 ~ 7 bar respectively. To get the 50 % breakdown value under lightning impulse of both polarity and AC, the up and down method was applied. In addition, both mixtures were tested in earthing switch and disconnecting <b>switch</b> <b>sections</b> of GIS model. The test result is applied to make design criteria for mixtures...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} torque ripples of disk-type {{low-power}} {{brushless direct current}} motor (BDCM) with permanent magnets. In spite of numerous studies on designing of valve engines this issue is understudied as yet. The torque ripples cause noise and vibration and can significantly limit accuracy when used in instrumentation, computer technology. We consider a motor that includes a power unit consisting of a rotor and a stator. There are ferrite elements of sensor on the rotor, and the nonmagnetic disk, bonded to it, contains permanent magnets. The rotor is mounted on a rotating shaft. The stator consists of a steel casing and bonded to it non-magnetic, non-conductive disk with holes. In the disk holes from both sides are mounted armature coils. The armature winding consists of two sections {{each of which has}} 6 coils. Each adjacent coil in section has an opposite direction of winding. The coils are arranged circumferentially and are shifted relative to each other; the displacement angle between the coils of one section is equal to 2 π/ 6 (rad). Sections are also shifted relative to each other; the angular shift is π/ 6 (rad). Sections are connected to the output terminals of the electronic <b>switch.</b> <b>Sections</b> of motor windings have the reverse full-wave power. The paper has investigated the steady operation at four-stroke switching and under constant load (torque). In this case, the electromagnetic torque and rotor speed are periodical functions of the rotor rotation angle. The dependencies of the averaged torque on the rotation speed have been obtained. The spectral distribution of the torque ripples at various rotor speeds of rotation has been calculated. The dependencies of the torque on the speed were studied both at constant speed and taking into account the uneven speed. Based on the research findings of disk type BDCM was computed a level of ripples amounted to 0. 8 - 5 %, which is quite acceptable for use in a drive. The results are useful for selecting the motor parameters at its designing stage. </p...|$|E
