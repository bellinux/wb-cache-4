5|$|Grapes {{are mostly}} grown for making wine and vinegar as basic {{components}} of the Mediterranean diet, as well for drying as raisins or for eating as table grapes. Raisins and table grape varieties are chosen for their flavour. Grape production remains important in the Mediterranean area, with <b>Southern</b> <b>Europe</b> accounting for 21% of the world's harvest. In 2014, Italy produced 6.9 million tonnes (mt) of grapes, Spain 6.2 mt, France 6.2 mt, Turkey 4.2 mt, and Germany 1.2 mt. Wine production for <b>Southern</b> <b>Europe</b> was 37% of the world total in 2014, with Italy producing 4.8 mt, Spain 4.6 mt, France 4.3 mt, and Germany 0.9 mt.|$|E

5|$|Although Bosch's career flourished {{during the}} High Renaissance, {{he lived in}} an area where the beliefs of the medieval Church still held moral authority. He would have been {{familiar}} with some of the new forms of expression, especially those in <b>Southern</b> <b>Europe,</b> although it is difficult to attribute with certainty which artists, writers and conventions had a bearing on his work.|$|E
5|$|Although P. rebeli {{is found}} across the Palearctic (see subspecies), it is {{difficult}} to determine exactly where they inhabit because of their similarity with P. alcon. In Western Europe they are thought to be concentrated in the Alps and in <b>Southern</b> <b>Europe.</b>|$|E

5|$|Hunters {{threaten}} the black stork {{in some countries}} of <b>southern</b> <b>Europe</b> and Asia, such as Pakistan, and breeding populations may have been eliminated there. The black stork vanished from the Ticino River valley in northern Italy, with hunting a likely contributor. In 2005, black storks were released into the Parco Lombardo del Ticino {{in an attempt to}} re-establish the species there.|$|E
5|$|In two {{subsequent}} studies, however, Richard {{and colleagues}} (2014) and Loizides and colleagues (2015) used DNA analysis {{to determine that}} this species is identical to morels collected in <b>southern</b> <b>Europe,</b> matching the original description of Morchella tridentina by Bresadola. This name therefore takes precedence over M. frustrata.|$|E
25|$|Milan {{is one of}} <b>southern</b> <b>Europe's</b> key {{transport}} nodes and one of Italy's most important railway hubs. Its five major railway stations, such as the Milan Central station, are among Italy's busiest.

5|$|Jesus {{appears as}} an infant in a manger (feed trough) in Christmas creches, which depict the Nativity scene. He is {{typically}} joined by Mary, Joseph, animals, shepherds, angels, and the Magi. Francis of Assisi (1181/82–1226) is credited with popularizing the creche, although he probably did not initiate it. The creche reached its height of popularity in the 17th and 18th centuries in <b>southern</b> <b>Europe.</b>|$|E

5|$|The bee-eaters are a {{group of}} near {{passerine}} birds in the family Meropidae. Most species are found in Africa but others occur in <b>southern</b> <b>Europe,</b> Madagascar, Australia and New Guinea. They are characterised by richly coloured plumage, slender bodies and usually elongated central tail feathers. All are colourful and have long downturned bills and pointed wings, which give them a swallow-like appearance when seen from afar.|$|E

50|$|<b>Southern</b> <b>Europe's</b> most emblematic {{climate is}} that of the Mediterranean climate, which has become a {{typically}} known characteristic of the area. The Mediterranean climate covers much of Portugal, Spain, Southeast France, Italy, Albania, Greece, the Western and Southern coastal regions of Turkey as well as the Mediterranean islands. Those areas of Mediterranean climate present similar vegetations and landscapes throughout, including dry hills, small plains, pine forests and olive trees.|$|R
5|$|The immune {{response}} of tree sparrows is less robust {{than that of}} the house sparrow and has been proposed as a factor in the greater invasive potential of the latter. The house sparrow and tree sparrow are the most frequent victims of roadkill on the roads of Central, Eastern and <b>Southern</b> <b>Europe.</b> The maximum recorded age is 13.1 years, but three years is a typical lifespan.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough breeds in Ireland, western Great Britain, the Isle of Man, <b>southern</b> <b>Europe</b> and the Mediterranean basin, the Alps, and in mountainous country across Central Asia, India and China, {{with two}} {{separate}} {{populations in the}} Ethiopian Highlands.

40|$|A {{rare and}} {{critically}} acclaimed translation of short fiction from Bulgarian by D. Enev, one of <b>Southern</b> <b>Europe's</b> {{masters of the}} short story. Drawing on the monsters and myths of Balkan folklore, the brutal reality of the Communist regime, and the dazzling magic of Enev's own imagination, these stories have an almost hypnotic and surreal quality. Absurd, both painfully funny and deeply sad, "Circus Bulgaria", reaches straight into the cracked heart of the Eastern Europe...|$|R

5|$|There {{are three}} widely {{recognised}} subspecies of the Egyptian vulture, {{although there is}} considerable gradation due to movement and intermixing of the populations. The nominate subspecies, N. p. percnopterus, has the largest range, occurring in <b>southern</b> <b>Europe,</b> northern Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and the north-west of India. Populations breeding in the temperate zone migrate south during winter. It has a dark grey bill.|$|E
5|$|While devotional {{paintings}} – especially altarpieces – remained {{dominant in}} Early Netherlandish art, secular portraiture became increasingly common in both northern and <b>southern</b> <b>Europe</b> as artists freed {{themselves from the}} prevailing idea that portraiture should be restricted to saints and other religious figures. In Italy this development was tied to the ideals of humanism.|$|E
