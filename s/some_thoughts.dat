5|$|Barbauld's {{pedagogy}} was fundamentally {{based on}} John Locke's <b>Some</b> <b>Thoughts</b> Concerning Education (1693), {{the most influential}} pedagogical treatise in 18th-century Britain. Building on Locke's theory of the Association of Ideas, which he had outlined in <b>Some</b> <b>Thoughts,</b> philosopher David Hartley had developed an associationist psychology that greatly influenced writers such as Barbauld (who had read Joseph Priestley's redaction of it). For the first time, educational theorists and practitioners were {{thinking in terms of}} developmental psychology. As a result, Barbauld and the women writers she influenced produced the first graded texts and the first body of literature designed for an age-specific readership.|$|E

5|$|Locke's <b>Some</b> <b>Thoughts</b> Concerning Education was {{a runaway}} best-seller. During {{the eighteenth century}} alone, <b>Some</b> <b>Thoughts</b> was {{published}} in at least 53 editions: 25 English, 16 French, six Italian, three German, two Dutch, and one Swedish. It was also excerpted in novels such as Samuel Richardson's Pamela (1740–1), and it formed the theoretical basis of much children's literature, particularly that of the first successful children's publisher, John Newbery. According to James Secord, an eighteenth-century scholar, Newbery included Locke's educational advice to legitimise the new genre of children's literature. Locke's imprimatur would ensure the genre's success.|$|E

5|$|Locke {{wrote the}} letters that would {{eventually}} become <b>Some</b> <b>Thoughts</b> for an aristocratic friend, but his advice had a broader appeal since his educational principles allowed commoners to think they could acquire {{the same kind of}} character as the aristocrats for whom Locke originally intended the work.|$|E

5|$|<b>Some</b> <b>Thoughts</b> Concerning Education is a 1693 {{treatise}} on {{the education of}} gentlemen written by the English philosopher John Locke. For over a century, {{it was the most}} important philosophical work on education in England. It was translated into almost all of the major written European languages during the eighteenth century, and nearly every European writer on education after Locke, including Jean-Jacques Rousseau, acknowledged its influence.|$|E

5|$|Two essay {{collections}} {{were published}} during Orwell's lifetime—Inside the Whale and Other Essays in 1940 and Critical Essays in 1946 (the latter {{published in the}} United States as Dickens, Dali, and Others in 1958.) His publisher followed up these anthologies with Shooting an Elephant and Other Essays in 1950, England Your England and Other Essays in 1953—which was revised as Such, Such Were the Joys—and Collected Essays in 1961. The first significant publications in the United States were Doubleday's A Collection of Essays by George Orwell from 1954, 1956's The Orwell Reader, Fiction, Essays, and Reportage from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, and Penguin's Selected Essays in 1957; re-released in 1962 with the title Inside the Whale and Other Essays and in abridged form as Why I Write in 2005 {{as a part of}} the Great Ideas series. In the aforementioned series, Penguin also published the short collections Books v. Cigarettes (2008), <b>Some</b> <b>Thoughts</b> on the Common Toad (2010), and Decline of the English Murder (2009). The later does not contain the same texts as Decline of the English Murder and Other Essays, published by Penguin in association with Secker & Warburg in 1965. The complete texts Orwell wrote for the Observer are collected in Orwell: The Observer Years published by Atlantic Books in 2003.|$|E

25|$|In <b>Some</b> <b>Thoughts</b> Concerning Education, John Locke (1693) {{argues that}} the purpose of {{education}} is to promote rational thinking.

25|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed. In his last years, {{he seemed to}} have been {{planning}} two major treatises, one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts. The posthumously published Essays on Philosophical Subjects, a history of astronomy down to Smith's own era, plus <b>some</b> <b>thoughts</b> on ancient physics and metaphysics, probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise. Lectures on Jurisprudence were notes taken from Smith's early lectures, plus an early draft of The Wealth of Nations, published as part of the 1976 Glasgow Edition of the works and correspondence of Smith. Other works, including some published posthumously, include Lectures on Justice, Police, Revenue, and Arms (1763) (first published in 1896); and Essays on Philosophical Subjects (1795).|$|E
500|$|Along with Rousseau's [...] (1762), Locke's <b>Some</b> <b>Thoughts</b> Concerning Education {{was one of}} the {{foundational}} eighteenth-century texts on educational theory. In Britain, it was considered the standard treatment of the topic for over a century. For this reason, some critics have maintained that <b>Some</b> <b>Thoughts</b> Concerning Education vies with the Essay Concerning Human Understanding for the title of Locke's most influential work. Some of Locke's contemporaries, such as seventeenth-century German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Leibniz, believed this as well; Leibniz argued that <b>Some</b> <b>Thoughts</b> superseded even the Essay in its impact on European society.|$|E
