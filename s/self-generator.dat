Blind {{separation}} of binaural mixed sounds using single-input multiple-output (SIMO) -model-based independent component analysis (SIMO-ICA) with <b>self-generator</b> for initial filter (SIMO-ICA-SG) {{is now being}} studied by the authors. This method contains frequency-domain ICA (FDICA-PB), single-talk detection, direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, head related transfer function (HRTF) matrix bank, and SIMO-ICA. This paper describes robustness of SIMO-ICA-SG against the mismatch of HRTF matrix bank. To evaluate it, the sound decomposition experiments are carried out under the real acoustic conditions. The experimental results reveal that the decomposition performance of the proposed method with mismatched HRTF matrix bank is superior {{to those of the}} conventional methods, and almost the same as those of the proposed method with matched one...|$|E

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} in 1994 increased {{for the fourth}} year in a row, reaching an all-time high. It {{was associated with a}} robust economy, low inflation, and low unemployment rates. Of the populous states, California lagged substantially behind the national recovery. Consumption in all major end-use sectors reached historic highs. Transmission of electrical power by the utilities increased almost 3 %. However, this understates the increase of the total amount of electricity used in the nation because the amount of electricity used ``in-house`` by a growing number of <b>self-generators</b> is unrecorded. Imports of both fossil fuels and electricity increased. About half of the total oil consumed was imported, with Saudi Arabia being the principal supplier. Domestic oil production continued to decline; however, the sharp decline in Alaskan production was slowed. The increase in the demand for natural gas was met by both a modest increase in domestic production and imports from Canada, which comprised 10 % of supply. The residential/commercial sector is the largest single consumer of natural gas; however, use by electric generators has increased annually for the past decade. The regulated utilities increased their consumption 11 % in 1994. The year was noteworthy for the US nuclear power industry. Work was halted on the last nuclear power plant under construction in the country. Because of the retirement of aged and poorly performing nuclear plants and because of improved efficiencies, the capacity factor for the remaining 109 operable plants reached a record 74 %...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the blind {{separation}} problem of binaural mixed signals, and propose a novel blind separation method using Single-Input-Multiple-Output-model-based independent component analysis (SIMO-ICA) with a <b>self-generator</b> (SG) {{for the initial}} filter. SIMO-ICA which has been proposed by the authors can separate mixed signals, not into monaural source signals but into SIMO-model-based signals from independent sources as {{they are at the}} microphones. Although this attractive feature of SIMO-ICA is beneficial to the binaural sound separation, SIMO-ICA has a serious drawback in its high sensitivity to the initial settings of the separation filter. In the proposed method, the SG functions as the preprocessor of SIMO-ICA, and it can provide a valid initial filter for SIMO-ICA. To evaluate its effectiveness, binaural sound separation experiments are carried out under a reverberant condition. The experimental results reveal that the separation performance of the proposed method is superior to those of conventional methods. 1...|$|E

40|$|Chemical {{models are}} {{indispensable}} tool in chemistry class and enable secondary school pupils to develop complex thought processes and spatial concepts, {{both of which}} are necessary to improve their understanding of chemical concepts. In this research, special emphasis is given to complex competencies not only their acquisition, but rather how pupils develop them. For this purpose, a learning strategy has been developed, called learning by self-generating chemical models. Pupils learn individually on their own models, which are made from easily accessible, low-cost materials. The impact of workable models was investigated (assembly of commercial models and production of self-made models) on the (1) learning success using simple molecule shapes and (2) the degree of competence development which realized through the implemented activities. The study involved first-year secondary school-pupils, defined as self-creators of paper- and -wire models (experimental group) and assemblers of commercial models (called the control group). The appearance of the molecules being studied took the form of geometric shapes and structures, which pupils present by making of ball-, called wire-models from plasticine and wire or paper created, called paper models. Based on the results of statistical processing of the data, we found that self-creation of models (as an innovative approach) leads to better understanding and to subsequently sustained knowledge for the pupil. It {{should also be noted that}} pupils who were <b>self-generators</b> in comparisons to those who merely assembled the models, generally developed many complex skills in the areas of problem solving, practical competence, mathematical competence and critical thinking skills. The knowledge so acquired was also better understood...|$|R
40|$|Renewable {{energy sources}} such as biomass, wind and solar power are {{relatively}} new means of generating electricity. Until recently, electricity was typically dominated by fossil fuels (coal, gas and oil), large-scale hydro and nuclear power in centralised systems of very large, GW-scale generation units. In contrast, new renewable power is typically built in smaller units and can attract investors outside the traditional circle of utilities and industrial <b>self-generators.</b> 1 Whilst renewables rely heavily on public funding to support their further development and deployment, they are becoming more competitive with traditional electricity generation technologies and can seriously affect their profitability, even their survival. 2 Together these factors mean that incumbent utilities (i. e. major companies that dominate conventional electricity production) {{have been forced to}} respond to something we refer to as the ‘renewable challenge’. Since the 1990 s, when many European electricity markets were ‘liberalised’, there has been a trend towards further market concentration. This means that some incumbents are now among the most highly capitalised companies in the world. 3 Prior to liberalisation, many European utilities had close links to the state via public ownership and via sub-national or national monopolies. Utilities were seen as a key infrastructure industry and offered career opportunities to former political leaders and bureaucrats. Hence one would expect that utilities could face the renewable challenge from a position of strength. Surprisingly this has not always been the case. Incumbents in Germany and Sweden – the two countries discussed here – demonstrate a wide range of responses to the renewables challenge. In this chapter we analyse utilities’ responses to the renewable challenge using the reactive-defensive-accommodative-proactive scale as popularised by research on Corporate Social Responsibility. 4 By responses, we refer primarily to incumbents’ ‘nonmarket’ strategies for dealing with renewables. Generally speaking, nonmarket strategies are typically those that seek to influence “the social, political, and legal arrangements that structure interactions outside of, although in conjunction with, markets and private agreements”. 5 Since public policy is a major determinant of market opportunities related to renewable energy, we focus particularly on incumbents’ attempts to influence renewable energy policies. However, in some instances we describe how incumbents have sought to influence renewables through court cases (legal arrangements) and the media (social arrangements). We trace incumbents’ nonmarket strategies in Germany and Sweden through time to show that responses to the renewable challenge vary according to different social and political contexts...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho tem o objetivo de relatar e analisar a história dos projetos hidrelétricos conhecidos por b̈otox(̈expressão cunhada aos projetos mais velhos com roupagem de novos), desde sua origem, ainda na primeira reforma do setor elétrico brasileiro em 1998, até seu desfecho, no leilão de energia nova de 2007, já no âmbito da segunda reforma do setor elétrico iniciada em 2004. Para sua total compreensão, é feita a historiografia do setor elétrico desde o Código de Águas, vis-à-vis da política econômica mundial e de seus reflexos na economia nacional. A dissertação prossegue com a descrição das alterações regulatórias, principalmente no que se refere ao critério de licitação de concessões de aproveitamentos hidrelétricos, caracterizando e identificando como se formou essa categoria de empreendimentos b̈otox. ̈ Após a conceituação teórica de leilões, são analisadas as participações desse tipo de projeto nos cinco leilões de energia nova, ocorridos entre 2005 e 2007. Além de uma abordagem sob o ponto de vista do produtor independente de energia elétrica, também é feita análise de que forma a alteração da regulamentação para outorga de concessões de geração e para comercialização de energia modificou a perspectiva de evolução do valor da energia elétrica para os autoprodutores. Por fim, é feita breve discussão sobre o processo de licenciamento {{ambiental}} desses projetos, com ênfase em seus aspectos regulatórios. This thesis aims {{to discuss}} and analyze {{the history of a}} particularly hydroelectric power plants group, nicknamed as b̈otox. ̈ This expression {{comes from the fact that}} those projects were old ones, which have been previously conceived, that were treated as brand new by the Brazilian regulatory framework. Its history has began from the Brazilian electricity industry reform in the 1990 s. This history reaches its final step in the 2007 auction, already under the revised power sector model launched in 2004, which marked the last opportunity of the so-called b̈otoxp̈rojects to participate closing deals to sell long term energy in a specially designed auction. To perform this analysis, it is firstly reported the context were the b̈otoxẅere conceived in the recent history of Brazilin Electricity Sector, and how power plants group was impacted by the shifts of international economic trends. The next section discusses the last two power sector reforms, particularly addressing the shifts hydro-plants investors faced on having access to concession auctions for new projects. After providing the background of the auction mechanism theory, it is examined the newly designed electricity auction adopted in Brazil as well as the results of the auctions that took place between 2004 up to 2007. Finally, it is discussed implications of the rules regarding the latest industry reform and regulatory issues towards environmental licenses, focusing on their impacts on the willingness to invest of <b>self-generators</b> owners of b̈otoxp̈rojects...|$|R
40|$|The human-powered <b>self-generator</b> {{provides}} the best solution for individuals who need an instantaneous power supply for travel, outdoor, and emergency use, since it is less dependent on weather conditions and occupies less space than other renewable power supplies. However, many commercial portable self-generators that employ hand-cranking are not used as much as expected in daily lives although they have enough output capacity due to their intensive workload. This study proposes a portable human-powered generator {{which is designed to}} obtain mechanical energy from an upper limb pulling motion for improved human motion economy as well as efficient human-mechanical power transfer. A coreless axial-flux permanent magnet machine (APMM) and a flywheel magnet rotor were used in conjunction with a one-way clutched power transmission system in order to obtain effective power from the pulling motion. The developed prototype showed an average energy conversion efficiency of 30. 98 % and an average output power of 0. 32 W with a maximum of 1. 89 W. Its small form factor (50 mm × 32 mm × 43. 5 mm, 0. 05 kg) and the substantial electricity produced verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in the utilization of human power. It is expected that the developed generator could provide a mobile power supply...|$|E
40|$|We have {{recently}} experienced historic {{changes in the}} electric power industry of the United States and almost all over the world. Deregulation and market competition are being touted as the main wheels to drive these changes to the frontiers of efficiency and new services. An extremely important, and under-researched, area for both suppliers and consumers in the new power markets is backup power contracting. Backup power is important because an essential attribute of electric power is its steady continuous availability, i. e., its reliability. In {{the good old days}} of regulated, vertically integrated firms, the local distribution company had to face the full challenges of assuring reliability for all customers in the local distribution franchise area. Indeed, the newest wave of deregulation, so-called Distributed Generation (DG), calls for groups of retail customers, perhaps a shopping mall or a group of co-located businesses, to install their own generators. Distributed Generation and traditional areas of self-generation are expected to continue to grow substantially as deregulation continues worldwide. This is already clear for households, where power interruptions are viewed as major inconveniences. But for industrial customers, such inconveniences extend well beyond the irritation of failed air conditioning on a hot day; they imply potentially significant economic losses in the event of disruptions. Efficient levels of backup power are required to avoid such losses. Accordingly, this dissertation addresses the area of self-generation and necessary support services for such generation in terms of the supply and pricing of backup power, to be provided by local distribution companies to industrial self-generators and, perhaps, to groups of retail customers that may set up their own local generation units. Optimal self-generation investment and backup power contracting strategies for a <b>self-generator</b> are characterized. Thereafter, expected profit-maximizing pricing and capacity strategies for a backup supplier serving one or more self-generators are characterized when the backup supplier has both generation itself as well as backstop supply from an alternative bulk-power supplier, such as a spot market. Expected welfare-maximizing pricing and capacity will be employed as a benchmark study to discuss possible regulatory policies on backup power supply. ...|$|E
