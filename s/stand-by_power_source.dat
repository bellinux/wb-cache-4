30|$|Electric vehicle {{charging}} and discharging technologies mainly have four modes, i.e. unidirectional disordered charging mode, unidirectional ordered charging mode, and bidirectional ordered charging and discharging modes. Unidirectional charging mode can only receive electricity from distribution networks, but cannot feed the surplus electricity of EVs back to distribution networks [36]. Bidirectional ordered charging and discharging modes {{mean that the}} EVs are connected with and controlled by the energy management system of distribution networks. The batteries of EVs are regarded as the moving power storage equipment and <b>stand-by</b> <b>power</b> <b>source</b> to realize the energy conversion with distribution networks [37].|$|E
40|$|Abstract –The self-oscillating flyback {{converter}} {{is a popular}} circuit for cost-sensitive applications due to its simplicity and low component count. It is widely employed in mobile phone chargers and as the <b>stand-by</b> <b>power</b> <b>source</b> in off-line power supplies for data-processing equipment. However, the optimization of this circuit is almost exclusively performed by a cutand-try approach since its operation is generally not well understood. This paper presents a detailed steady-state analysis of the self-oscillating {{flyback converter}} along with its small-signal model. Design guidelines of the control circuit and loop compensation are presented and verified on an offline, stand-by, 5 -V / 2 -A power supply. I...|$|E

During this time, we have: 1) built a fuel cell laboratory and production facility, 2) designed, constructed, and installed a 1. 5 kW PEM fuel cell for use as a <b>stand-by</b> <b>power</b> <b>source</b> at the Schatz Solar Hydrogen Project, and 3) conducted research to improve power density and lower manufacturing costs of fuel cells. SERC has now turned its focus to the Palm Desert Fuel Cell Vehicle Project. The goal of this project is to develop a clean and sustainable transportation system for a community. The project involves a consortium which includes the City of Palm Desert, DuPont, SERC, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). The goal will be accomplished by: ??? Designing, building, and operating a fleet of personal utility vehicles (PUV's) and neighborhood electric vehicles (NEV's) powered by hydrogen fueled PEM fuel cells. Various modes of on-board storage of hydrogen will be investigated in a companion project undertaken by Sandia National Laboratory (SNL). ??? Designing, building, and operating a refueling infrastructure relevant to future hydrogen based transportation systems. This will include two hydrogen refueling stations. One station will be wind powered; the second will be solar powered. ???
