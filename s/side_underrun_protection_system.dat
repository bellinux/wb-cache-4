This paper reports on the first results of the project dealing with accident investigation and results from car-to-truck frontal crash tests with a front <b>underrun</b> <b>protection</b> device (FUPD) according to ECE Regulation No. 93. For the first time accident data of several European countries have been connected to give an overview about the accident scene in Europe with respect to car-to-truck frontal collisions.

50|$|Technically {{called a}} Rear <b>Underrun</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>System</b> (RUPS), {{this is a}} rigid {{assembly}} hanging down from the bottom rear of the trailer, which is intended to provide some protection for passenger cars which collide with {{the rear of the}} trailer. Public awareness of this safeguard was increased {{in the aftermath of the}} accident that killed actress Jayne Mansfield on 29 June 1967, when the car she was in hit the rear of a tractor-trailer, causing fatal head trauma. After her death, the NHTSA recommended requiring a rear underride guard, also known as a Mansfield bar, an ICC bar, or a DOT bumper, but the trucking industry has been slow to upgrade this safety feature.|$|R
40|$|EEVC Working Group 14 is {{investigating}} the effect of fixing energy absorbing front <b>underrun</b> <b>protection</b> <b>systems</b> (eaFUPS) to trucks instead of rigid devices {{in order to reduce}} the injury severity to car occupants in car-to-truck frontal collisions. Three car-to-truck crash tests with cars from different mass groups at a speed of 75 kph are carried out. The results are compared with the results from identical tests carried out earlier with cars at a speed of 56 kph running into a truck with a rigid front <b>underrun</b> <b>protection</b> device. It appears that the deceleration pulses of identical cars in the different tests show almost identical shapes and peak levels. Having almost identical deceleration pulses, identical injury results for the car occupants would have been expected. However, the injury results are not all directly comparable. The deviating signals can be explained. Based on the results of the tests it can be concluded that the positive effect of an eaFUP is not unambiguously proven yet...|$|R
40|$|For {{the last}} five years, are average of 38 500 {{people have been killed}} each year in Europe in road traffic {{accidents}} and, even if Heavy Goods Vehicles represent only 1 % of the vehicle registered, they have been involved in more than 5000 fatal accidents in 2009. Among these accidents involving trucks, 65 % involved the truck front. The severity of these crashes {{can be explained by the}} large mass difference between cars and trucks that inevitably leads to higher deceleration pulses for the passenger car; most of times followed by major deformations of the car passenger compartment. In the worse frontal crash cases, the car ends under the truck. To reduce the risk of trucks overriding passenger cars and reduce the crash severity, so-called Front <b>Underrun</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Systems</b> have been developed and are now compulsory on new trucks in Europe. The efficiency of these systems has been proved by different studies but it has also been shown that they could be even more efficient if their energy absorption could be increased for instance by increasing the deformation length. The purpose of this thesis work was therefore to quantify the possible crash severity reduction, mainly for the car occupants, from an additional truck frontal structure in case of frontal crash between cars and trucks and to make recommendations on a new front structure of heavy trucks that can have an injury reducing potential for car occupants. In this study the length, the stiffness and the basic design of this new truck front structure have been investigated. The study has been made mainly using Finite Element simulations but also using analytical calculations. The results confirm that the use of a longer energy absorbing structure in front of the truck would decrease the crash severity for the car occupants while experiencing a frontal crash with a truck. The critical impact speeds are increased since the new truck structure is absorbing much more energy than current Front <b>Underrun</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Systems.</b> Because of the new frontal structure load distribution, the forces that need to be carried by the truck front structure are also lowered...|$|R
40|$|Truck {{accidents}} {{represent a}} significant factor in the overall road accident scene, namely 25 to 30 % of the fatal accidents in the EU. Collision partners of trucks are mainly passenger cars in car-to-truck frontal collisions. The severity of this kind of accidents is due to the incompatibility of both vehicles. Today's passenger cars are built in a way that occupants stand a high chance of surviving a frontal impact to 56 kph. A truck fit with a rigid Front <b>Underrun</b> <b>Protection</b> Device would supply compatibility, which will reduce the number of 4200 fatalities under the car occupants yearly with 900. However, the average relative speed in car-to-truck frontal collisions is approximately 75 kph. To protect cars at these speeds it is essential that the truck bumper absorbs part of the crash energy. If trucks were equipped with an energy-absorbing Front <b>Underrun</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>System,</b> at least 300 car occupants more would not be killed. This paper describes a combined approach of full-scale crash tests and numerical simulations to predict the effects of rigid and energy absorbing front <b>underrun</b> <b>protection</b> of trucks. The reduction of injuries to driver and passenger was verified in a crash test where the truck absorbed part of the impact energy. The activities were carried out by a consortium of research institutes and truck manufacturers, in the framework of the European Enhanced Vehicle-Safety Committee (EEVC) Working Group 14 activities...|$|R
40|$|In 2001, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe {{decided that}} all trucks {{manufactured}} as from that year need a front <b>underrun</b> <b>protection</b> <b>system</b> (FUPS). This {{as a step}} in order to decrease fatalities in head-on collisions between heavy goods vehicles (HGV) and passenger cars. A further development of the FUPS is an energy absorbing FUPS (EA-FUPS). For a safety system like the EA-FUPS {{it is important that}} its functions work properly in both expected and unexpected crash scenarios. In other words, the system should be robust. In addition to a robust behaviour one would like to determine the successfulness of the system, i. e., the reliability of the system should be evaluated. This Master's Thesis contains a reliability and robustness study of an EA-FUPS, where stochastic analysis of a head-on collision between an HGV and a passenger car has been utilised. In this analysis the probability density functions (PDF:s) of collisions and structural parameters have been set up according to statistics from real-world accidents and manufacturing data. Several responses from the numerous crash simulations, solved with an explicit nite element method, were logged and statistics were used to set up, e. g., probabilities and scatter plots to evaluate the system. The results show a FUPS that, although the energy absorbing capabilities are rather non-robust and unreliable, fulls its prime objective, which is protecting the passenger car from underrunning the HGV. However, when the vehicle overlap is small the FUPS is not still enough to protect the wheel from being hit. There are several reasons for the unreliable energy absorption level, e. g., the energy absorbing mechanism has poor compatibility with the front structure of many passenger cars. Besides the resulting reliability and robustness analyses, an algorithm for performing robust CAE is presented...|$|R
40|$|SWOV {{has studied}} the {{circumstances}} of blind spot crashes and has looked for solutions and measures that can {{reduce the number of}} blind spot crashes. One of the reasons for this study was a discussion in Dutch Parliament about the blind spot issue. The design and the realization of the study were closely tuned with the Ministry of Transport. Elaborate consultations were also held with other interested parties. The Netherlands has been struggling with the blind spot issue for many years now: serious crashes involving lorries turning right and cyclists going straight ahead. In the last decades, the European Union has introduced several measures for lorries to prevent this type of crash: in the 1980 s the close proximity mirror (Class V in Directive 2003 / 97 /EC) was made compulsory, and <b>side</b> <b>underrun</b> <b>protection</b> in 1995. In 2003, the Netherlands was first to introduce the wide angle mirror (Class IV in Directive 2003 / 97 /EC); Denmark and Belgium followed a year later. This measure was specifically intended for countries with many cyclists. The Netherlands still counts an average of 15 fatalities per year despite these measures. Although the numbers of fatalities showed a temporary considerable reduction in the years 2002 and 2003, this study shows that this was the case for all crash types involving both lorries and cyclists. This may however be due to the general attention for crashes involving lorries when the wide angle mirror was introduced, and not be caused by the mirror itself. Each blind spot crash causes social unrest because of the severity of the crash and the notion that there must be ways to prevent this type of crash. The study is based on analyses of serious blind spot crashes in the period 1997 - 2006, and on police reports from the years 2006 and 2007. The detailed crash data from the police reports were supplemented with survey data acquired from surviving cyclists and lorry drivers who had been involved in blind spot crashes. Traffic observations were also made at the locations were these crashes had occurred. Both groups of road users were interviewed to gain insight in the way cyclists and lorry drivers deal with the blind spot problem in daily practice. In addition, the everyday traffic situation was observed and, in the cab, the lorry drivers' actual behaviour was studied. This repor...|$|R

40|$|Freno AB in Piteå has {{developed}} a tractor with a semi-trailer based on a Volkswagen Crafter chassis. The modifications of the vehicle that are included in this thesis work covers the parking brake system of the semitrailer, the rear <b>underrun</b> <b>protection</b> device of the tractor and the maneuvering of the trailer’s service brake. The manufacturer of the tractor requests an independent analysis of whether these modifications have negative influences on the vehicle. A description of the parking brake system was made and its function was analyzed using force and torque equilibrium. The parking brake of the semi-trailer is maneuvered by an electric signal from the switch controlling the parking brake indicator on the dash board. The results were compared with regulations applicable by {{the date of the}} vehicle’s service entry. In theory, the parking brake meets the legal requirement to keep the vehicle stationary in a hill with 16 % slope and the design requirement of 18 %. Regulations regarding the rear <b>underrun</b> <b>protection</b> were studied and the company’s contact person was interviewed about the modification’s procedure. The <b>underrun</b> <b>protection</b> device has been moved forwards due to the shortening of the rear overhang. No modification has been made to the device itself that can affect its strength. According to EU Directive 70 / 221 /EC, rear <b>underrun</b> <b>protection</b> is not necessary for this vehicle type. For the maneuvering system of the semi-trailer’s service brakes, the designer was interviewed and a system description was formulated. The trailer’s service brakes are maneuvered by a directional valve connected to the tractor’s brake circuits. This valve is the only interface between the tractor and the semitrailer brake circuits. The maximum consumption of brake fluid caused by the directional valve is 0. 3 cm 3. A test method was produced to determine if pressure variations caused by the semi-trailer’s ABS system can be measured in the tractors brake circuits. The measurements are to be implemented with a pressure sensor connected to the master brake cylinder and a data logger which measures the brake pressure during a braking operation. Based on the recorded data the process can be analyzed. The test methodology was inspired by the test made to the vehicle by the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI) according to Directive 71 / 320 /EC.

50|$|Buffer underruns {{can cause}} serious {{problems}} during CD/DVD burning, because once {{the writing is}} started, it cannot stop and resume flawlessly; thus the pause needed by the underrun can cause the data on the disc to become invalid. Since the buffer is generally being filled from a relatively slow source, such as a hard disk or another CD/DVD, a heavy CPU or memory load from other concurrent tasks can easily exhaust the capacity of a small buffer. Therefore, a technique called buffer <b>underrun</b> <b>protection</b> was implemented by various individual CD/DVD writer vendors, under various trademarks, such as Plextor BurnProof, Nero UltraBuffer, Yamaha SafeBurn, JustLink, and Seamless Link.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to investigate the possibilities to assess (energy-absorbing) front <b>underrun</b> <b>protection</b> (FUP) devices with respect to injuries of the car occupant without using a car and dummy in the test procedure. A large number of different crash configurations are simulated to search for a clear relationship between injury and vehicle criteria. Secondly, a representative structure that can replace a car was found. The simulation results show a correlation between injury levels given by the HARM and the accident severity given by the ASI value. Furthermore, the simulation results show that energy absorption in the FUP lowers the ASI level for all crash scenarios, which consequently results in lower injury levels. The main conclusion is that it is possible to assess the eaFUP performance on the basis of vehicle acceleration signals (non-dummy signals). A component test procedure for assessing eaFUP can be developed on the basis of these simulation results. For a future test procedure, a combination of experimental and virtual testing is proposed. With virtual testing, the behaviour of the eaFUP in different crash scenarios can be evaluated...|$|R
