5|$|In 1971, the Environment Secretary, Peter Walker {{announced}} {{the entire length}} of the A303 would be upgraded as part of a new roads programme that would deliver 1,000 new miles of motorway by 1980. A bypass of Marsh was opened in 1976; it was (and remains) the only dual carriageway upgrade of the A303 through the Blackdown Hills. By the mid-1980s, the A303 had been extended from its original fork by Micheldever Station, next to the A30, eastwards to meet the M3 motorway, and was a completely uninterrupted dual carriageway westwards as far as Amesbury. Ilminster was bypassed around this time; however the new road was built as single carriageway with 3 lanes, which caused a serious <b>safety</b> <b>hazard</b> leading to several fatal accidents.|$|E

5|$|Within {{two decades}} {{the bridge was}} {{considered}} a <b>safety</b> <b>hazard,</b> due to increased traffic volume, speed, and truck sizes. The primary concerns were deficiency in the width and curve radius. The bridge was strengthened as well as widened in 1959–60. Removing the footpath and using that space for the road had been suggested, but instead the structure itself was widened by , leaving the footpath intact. The approaches to the bridges were widened, new piers were erected {{either side of the}} railway span, and eight new girders were installed – six of which were part of the previous Causeway structure. The work was undertaken from a suspended platform, which had to be quickly pulled up when trains went past. The widening, designed by Main Road's second bridge engineer Gilbert Marsh, cost approximately ₤20,000.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 2003, Kato Air {{took over}} the Bodø–Røst route, using Dornier Do 228 aircraft. The new airline had a troubled start with the {{passenger}} numbers dropping by 27 percent. On 4 December, a flight from Røst to Bodø was hit by lightning, and received severe damage during the landing at Bodø. The choice of the operator was criticized by the Røst Municipal Council following the incident, stated that the ministry had prioritized price over safety. The council stated {{that they did not}} feel that Kato Air provided the same service as Widerøe and that the aircraft were a <b>safety</b> <b>hazard.</b> Among the complaints were lack of accessibility for disabled people, no cabin pressurization, no weather radar, more expensive tickets, no discounted tickets and no possibility for carry-on baggage. In February 2006, there was a wave of cancellations by Kato Air, due to technical problems with both the airline's aircraft. In June, the airline's pilots started selling tickets themselves at the airport. The company stated that this was because they had declined Widerøe to do this because of higher costs. The Civil Aviation Authority of Norway withdrew Kato Air's concession in 2008 due to lack on maintenance. On an interim basis, the helicopter airline Lufttransport, that operated the route to the nearby island of Værøy, {{took over the}} route from 5 September to 29 October, when Widerøe started flying again.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To identify, classify, and {{describe}} <b>safety</b> <b>hazards</b> {{during the process}} of intrahospital transport of critically ill patients. Design: A prospective observational study. Data from participant observations of the intrahospital transport process were collected over a period of 3 months. Setting: The study was undertaken at two ICUs in one university hospital. Patients: Critically ill patients transported within the hospital by critical care nurses, unlicensed nurses, and physicians. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Content analysis was performed using deductive and inductive approaches. We detected a total of 365 <b>safety</b> <b>hazards</b> (median, 7; interquartile range, 4 – 10) during 51 intrahospital transports of critically ill patients, 80 % of whom were mechanically ventilated. The majority of detected <b>safety</b> <b>hazards</b> were assessed as increasing the risk of harm, compromising patient safety (n = 204). Using the System Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety, we identified <b>safety</b> <b>hazards</b> related to the work system, as follows: team (n = 61), tasks (n = 83), tools and technologies (n = 124), environment (n = 48), and organization (n = 49). Inductive analysis provided an in-depth description of those <b>safety</b> <b>hazards,</b> contributing factors, and process-related outcomes. Conclusions: Findings suggest that intrahospital transport is a hazardous process for critically ill patients. We have identified several factors that may contribute to transport-related adverse events, which will provide the opportunity for the redesign of systems to enhance patient safety. Full Tex...|$|R

40|$|An {{organization}} must {{strive to}} maintain its most valuable resource, knowledge, {{in order to be}} more productive and competitive. One of the steps to manage the knowledge is to capture contents of the knowledge. In construction site safety, success in capturing the tacit knowledge of safety officers is of paramount importance; however without a good mechanism, this process might be difficult due to time and hazard perception constraints. This paper discusses research in a design-for-safety-process tool, which aims at: (1) capturing safety knowledge from safety engineers about construction <b>safety</b> <b>hazards</b> and the <b>safety</b> measures required; (2) assisting a safety engineer to identify <b>safety</b> <b>hazards</b> in construction projects and determine the safety measures required; and (3) training students and inexperienced safety engineers in identifying <b>safety</b> <b>hazards</b> and the measures required.
