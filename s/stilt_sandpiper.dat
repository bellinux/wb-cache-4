Because providing adequate energetic resources for migratory birds is {{a high priority for}} wetland management, we also measured invertebrate abundance at managed wetlands in the RWB to determine how food abundance influences the occupancy and abundance of sandpipers on wetlands throughout the migratory period. To quantify habitat use, we surveyed wetlands every 7 – 10 days in both regions and visually estimated wetland attributes. Our results indicate that invertebrate abundance predicted occupancy, but not abundance, of sandpipers at wetlands in the RWB. The wetland vegetation characteristics that predict sandpiper occupancy are similar in both regions, but wetlands in the PPR support a higher abundance of sandpipers than wetlands in the RWB. Our results suggest that sandpipers make stopover decisions that balance local and regional wetland conditions. Managers should maintain the cues (i. e., mudflat) and ecological conditions beyond invertebrate abundance that predict sandpiper habitat use to successfully provide resources for sandpipers during migratory stopover if that is a goal of wetland management...|$|R

40|$|Much less {{apparent}} {{and well}} known than the annual crane migration is Nebraska’s {{role in the}} spring and fall migrations of shorebirds such as sandpipers, plovers, curlews and godwits. These migrations are inconspicuous, {{in part because of the}} fact that most long-distance shorebird flights occur at night. Shorebirds also never migrate in the enormous flocks that are so typical of geese and cranes, and their flights are usually unaccompanied by loud calls. Yet, they are massive if nearly invisible migrations, involving over 30 species and an estimated 200, 000 – 300, 000 birds. Many of the species travel from South American wintering grounds, and about half of them are bound for arctic tundra breeding grounds of Canada and Alaska. While resting and feeding between flights, the birds scatter across Nebraska’s smaller and shallower wetlands, from the undulating loess plains of Rainwater Basin between the Platte and Republican rivers, across the wet meadows of the Platte Valley, to the thousands of remote Sand Hills wetlands nestled between the Platte and Niobrara rivers. Nebraska’s wetlands are a small but important part of an intercontinental series of important stepping- stones used by shorebirds on their migrations. Some locations are especially valuable for certain species but may be little used by others. For example, the otherwise undistinguished agricultural fields and wetlands centered in Seward and Fillmore counties are probably the buff-breasted sandpiper’s single most important spring stopover area between its Argentine wintering sites and its high-arctic nesting grounds. Not far to the south, the shallow marshes of Cheyenne Bottoms Wildlife Area in central Kansas supports nearly half of North America’s total shorebird population, including more than 90 percent of the white-rumped, Baird’s and <b>stilt</b> <b>sandpipers,</b> long-billed dowitchers and Wilson’s phalaropes surveyed during spring in central and eastern North America.

40|$|The Rainwater Basin (RWB) has {{received}} limited attention {{as an important}} stopover area for migrant shorebirds because of an absence of basic survey data. Here I present the first comprehensive inventory of shorebird migration for the eastern Rainwater Basin (eRWB). These data document {{the importance of this}} region as a stopover site for migrants and will serve as a baseline for future monitoring efforts. During five years of spring and three years of fall surveys that covered a majority of wetlands in the eRWB, an average of 23, 700 and 5, 581 shorebirds were recorded in spring and fall, respectively. Of 38 species recorded, most numerous in decreasing order were Whiterumped Sandpiper, Wilson’s Phalarope, Semipalmated Sandpiper, Long-billed Dowitcher, <b>Stilt</b> <b>Sandpiper,</b> and Baird’s Sandpiper during spring and Pectoral Sandpiper, Long-billed Dowitcher, Lesser Yellowlegs, Least Sandpiper, and <b>Stilt</b> <b>Sandpiper</b> during fall. The RWB is an important stopover area for these species and {{it has been estimated that}} 200, 000 - 300, 000 shorebirds stopover in the region each spring. The surveys were conducted at a time when over 90 % of the RWB wetlands have been destroyed and the remaining wetlands are degraded. Prior to settlement there were nearly 4, 000 individual wetlands totaling up to 100, 000 acres. The dramatic reduction in terms of both quantity and diversity of wetland types and the degradation of existing wetlands has severely reduced the capacity of the RWB to provide adequate shorebird habitat. This reduced capacity has had implications not only locally and regionally, but also on international and hemispheric scales. The RWB is a distinct ecogeographical region where wetlands are dispersed over 10, 000 square kilometers. It has been customary for researchers and conservationists to focus on individual wetlands rather than recognize a group of small wetlands as a single entity even though shorebirds likely recognize and utilize a group of dispersed wetlands in the same manner as they would a single, large wetland. No single RWB wetland provides adequate habitat or hosts large numbers of shorebirds regularly since these wetlands are greatly influenced by climate, vegetation, and disturbance and are thereby highly dynamic. Nevertheless, during any particular migration or year there is a high degree of certainty that favorable habitat and large numbers of shorebirds will be found somewhere in the RWB. Individual wetlands that vary in size and type are merely components of a larger entity, a wetland complex. Focusing on individual wetlands essentially penalizes the RWB and similar complexes when considering the criteria set forth by the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network for recognition as a site of international importance. However when considered as a single entity, the RWB surpasses these criteria. Furthermore, the region may be of hemispheric importance to the Buff-breasted Sandpiper...|$|E
