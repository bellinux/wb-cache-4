25|$|Boyle's Law {{was perhaps}} the first {{expression}} of an equation of state. In 1662 Robert Boyle performed a series of experiments employing a J-shaped glass tube, which was <b>sealed</b> <b>on</b> one end. Mercury {{was added to the}} tube, trapping a fixed quantity of air in the short, sealed end of the tube. Then the volume of gas was carefully measured as additional mercury was added to the tube. The pressure of the gas could be determined by the difference between the mercury level in the short end of the tube and that in the long, open end. The image of Boyle's Equipment shows some of the exotic tools used by Boyle during his study of gases.|$|E

25|$|Boulton's Letter's Patent {{specifications}} were <b>sealed</b> <b>on</b> 4 August 1868 and {{the complete}} patent was backdated to its application date of 5 February 1868. His British patent, the 392nd one completed in 1868, was issued more than 35 years before ailerons were 'reinvented' in France, and ailerons were later repatented in the United States by Glenn Curtiss of the Aerial Experiment Association in about 1911. Boulton's 1868 patent became forgotten and lost from sight until the same time, {{a few years}} before they came into general use in 1915. Aviation historian C. H. Gibbs-Smith acknowledged Boulton's priority of invention, stating that if the 1868 patent had been revealed {{at the time of the}} Wright brothers' legal filings, they might not have been able to claim the priority of invention for the lateral control of flying machines.|$|E
25|$|The {{airport was}} {{partially}} flooded on 19 January 1989 when Årlelva breached its banks. The riverbed was subsequently moved and areas was freed up {{to allow for}} more parking, both {{on the air and}} land side. The airport partook in a major military exercise in 1991. The discussion regarding the airport's future was <b>sealed</b> <b>on</b> 6 April 1992 when the CAA announced {{the construction of a new}} terminal. Work commenced later that year and Braathens SAFE followed up with the construction of a freight terminal. The CAA invested NOK54 million, of which 30 million was for the terminal. The airport was closed for a week in September 1993 to re-asphalt the runway and move systems to the new terminal, which opened on 13 September. It was designed to handle 300,000 passengers per year and had three gates. In addition to larger arrival and departure halls, offices were provided for car rental companies. After the official opening took place on 14 October, the old terminal building was demolished to make way for more parking.|$|E
25|$|After the Austro-Hungarian {{administration}} had dissolved {{and the last}} governor (Josef Graf von Etzdorf) renounced power in favour of the Romanian and Ukrainian committees, the Ukrainian militias gained control of the province, and established a provisional government. The National Romanian Council reacted by demanding help from the Romanian Land Forces (General Iacob Zadig). The Romanian troops swiftly occupied the region, with little armed resistance from the Ukrainians, and installed martial law. Through a Congress of Nationalities held at Cernăuți, some of the various competing factions, who supported the preservation of integral Bukovina, came to an understanding. Bukovina's preservation and its union with Romania was <b>sealed</b> <b>on</b> November 28, 1918, although only the region's Romanians, Germans and Poles agreed that this should be unconditional. The Congress, which opened with a greeting to the Romanian Army, was boycotted by the Ukrainian and Jewish representatives. The Congress also renewed tensions between the two leaders of Bukovina's Romanian nationalist revival: Iancu Flondor, who supported regional autonomy and minority rights; and Nistor, who stood for ethnonationalism and welcomed centralized rule.|$|E

25|$|An {{adhesive}} sealant (polyisobutylene) {{is applied}} to the face of the spacer on each side and the panes pressed against the spacer. If the unit is gas filled, two holes are drilled into the spacer of the assembled unit, lines are attached to draw out the air out of the space and replacing it (or leaving just vacuum) with the desired gas. The lines are then removed and holes sealed to contain the gas. The more modern technique is to use an online gas filler, which eliminates the need to drill holes in the spacer. The units are then <b>sealed</b> <b>on</b> the edge side using either polysulfide or silicone sealant or similar material to prevent humid outside air from entering the unit. The desiccant will remove traces of humidity from the air space so that no water appears on the inside faces (no condensation) of the glass panes facing the air space during cold weather. Some manufacturers have developed specific processes that combine the spacer and desiccant into a single step application system.|$|E
25|$|The Pirelli {{dry suit}} was {{designed}} in the 1930s and used by Italian frogmen during World War II. It became available for recreational divers {{after the war and}} was patented (US Pat. No. 2,570,019) in 1951 for Pirelli by Eugenio Wolk, listed as the inventor. This two piece suit was made from thin and elastic rubber, optionally bonded to a knit fabric reinforcement liner except at the sealing areas at the neck, wrists and waist. The waist seal was achieved by overlapping the jacket and trousers and folding the overlap down more than once before securing it in place over a profiled heavy rubber waistband using an elastic belt which pulls the rolled part into a groove in the waistband. Neck and cuff seals were the forerunners of the latex seals still used for this application. The patent claims this to be the first application of thin and flexible form-fitting rubber for the manufacture of dry suits, and also patents the waist seal system. The suits were intended to be worn over woolen underwear for thermal protection. There was no facility to inject air during a dive. These suits were available in four sizes and five styles, three of which were full length two-piece suits with integral boots, one of which was lined with cloth, and two of which had an optional integral hood on the jacket. The other two models were a two-piece with short sleeves and legs, and a one piece short trouser unit with suspenders which <b>sealed</b> <b>on</b> the chest and thighs.|$|E
