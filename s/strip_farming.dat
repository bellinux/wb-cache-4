Possibly from the very start of the castle, and certainly by the 1380s, the castle buildings formed three distinct complexes supporting the Earl's household, the castle's constable and the administration of the Embleton barony respectively.

500|$|The land {{besides the}} canal is low lying, {{and there is}} {{evidence}} of <b>strip</b> <b>farming,</b> with a series of farms each with a long thin strip of land behind it. In this case the strips were [...] strips, appropximately [...] in size. The land is crossed by drainage ditches. To the north are those of Thorne Moors, while to the south, the drains include Boating Dyke, which was used for the export of peat during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The network of peat canals were largely destroyed by the cutting of the canal in 1802, and Boating Dyke now feeds into the North Engine Drain, which crosses Hatfield Chase and discharges into the River Trent at Keadby. After Maud's Swing Bridge is a long straight stretch, with the railway on the north bank. The North Soak Drain and South Soak Drain flank the canal on both sides, and were built because the canal disrupted the natural drainage of the area. Near to Crook o'Moor Swing Bridge was Medge Hall peat works, which exported peat from the moors by railway until it was closed in 1966.|$|E

2500|$|President Roosevelt {{ordered the}} Civilian Conservation Corps {{to plant a}} huge belt of more than 200million trees from Canada to Abilene, Texas to break the wind, hold water in the soil, and hold the soil itself in place. The {{administration}} also began to educate farmers on soil conservation and anti-erosion techniques, including crop rotation, <b>strip</b> <b>farming,</b> contour plowing, terracing, and other improved farming practices. [...] In 1937, the federal government began an aggressive campaign to encourage farmers in the Dust Bowl to adopt planting and plowing methods that conserved the soil. [...] The government paid reluctant farmers a dollar an acre to practice the new methods. [...] By 1938, the massive conservation effort had reduced the amount of blowing soil by 65%. The land still failed to yield a decent living. [...] In the fall of 1939, after nearly a decade of dirt and dust, the drought ended when regular rainfall finally returned to the region. The government still encouraged continuing the use of conservation methods to protect the soil and ecology of the Plains.|$|E

50|$|The Great Transformation (Det store hamskiftet) was {{a period}} of intense change in Norwegian society during the mid-to-late 19th century. During this time most Norwegian farmers ended their {{traditional}} self-sufficient lifestyle and become more specialized. <b>Strip</b> <b>farms</b> were consolidated under several Land Consolidation Acts, and new farming equipment was introduced. The country became more industrialized, and many people in rural areas began migrating to towns and cities or emigrating to the United States. The term was introduced by Norwegian writer Inge Krokann.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Strip</b> <b>farming</b> is {{a concept}} {{covering}} a land distribution in agriculture. In collective farmyards where every single farmer owned or rented {{a part of the}} farm, the properties become complicated. The home fields were divided into small strips and each family maintained rights to both the suitable and the lesser suitable fields. Outlying fields were not divided but kept in common use. Norwegian <b>strip</b> <b>farming</b> is a variation on the Open field system practiced in much of Europe from medieval to modern times.|$|E

25|$|Kew, {{the area}} in which Kew Gardens are situated, {{consists}} mainly of the gardens themselves and a small surrounding community. Royal residences in the area which would later influence the layout and construction of the gardens began in 1299 when Edward I moved his court to a manor house in neighbouring Richmond (then called Sheen). That manor house was later abandoned; however, Henry VII built Sheen Palace in 1501, which, under the name Richmond Palace, became a permanent royal residence for Henry VII. Around the start of the 16th century courtiers attending Richmond Palace settled in Kew and built large houses. Early royal residences at Kew included Mary Tudor's house, which was in existence by 1522 when a driveway was built to connect it to the palace at Richmond. Around 1600, the land that would become the gardens was known as Kew Field, a large field <b>strip</b> <b>farmed</b> by one of the new private estates.|$|R
