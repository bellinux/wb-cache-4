Either they say there are no demands and that leaves your critics confused, or they say that the demands for social {{equality}} and economic justice are impossible demands. And the impossible demands, they say, are just not practical. If hope is an impossible demand, then we demand the impossible – that the right to shelter, food and employment are impossible demands, then we demand the impossible. If it is impossible to demand that those who profit from the recession redistribute their wealth and cease their greed, then yes, we demand the impossible.|$|E

Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter criticized the acting calling it [...] "lethargically lifeless" [...] and criticized Haley's portrayal of Krueger, saying, [...] "Even with his electronically deepened voice and a pointless amount of backstory, there's just no replacing Englund". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 1 star out of 4, writing in his review, [...] "I stared at A Nightmare on Elm Street with weary resignation. The movie consists of a series of teenagers who are introduced, haunted by nightmares and then slashed to death by Freddy. <b>So</b> <b>what?</b> <b>Are</b> we supposed to be scared?

2500|$|This {{branch of}} {{mathematics}} {{deals with the}} long-term qualitative behavior of dynamical systems. Here, the focus is not on finding precise solutions to the equations defining the dynamical system (which is often hopeless), but rather to answer questions like [...] "Will the system settle down to a steady state in the long term, and if <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> the possible attractors?"

2500|$|The {{primitive}} {{attempt in}} dealing with differential equations had in view a reduction to quadratures. As {{it had been the}} hope of eighteenth-century algebraists to find a method for solving the general equation of the nth degree, so it was the hope of analysts to find a general method for integrating any differential equation. Gauss (1799) showed, however, that the differential equation meets its limitations very soon unless complex numbers are introduced. Hence, analysts began to substitute the study of functions, thus opening a new and fertile field. Cauchy was the first to appreciate the importance of this view. [...] Thereafter, the real question was to be not whether a solution is possible by means of known functions or their integrals but whether a given differential equation suffices for the definition of a function of the independent variable or variables, and, if <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> the characteristic properties of this function.|$|E

The Enterprise-D's end also appeared—the saucer crash had first been proposed as the cliffhanger for Moore's original seventh-season finale [...] "All Good Things...", which eventually became the series finale. Kirk's death was initially developed in Braga, Moore and Berman's story sessions. Moore recalled that [...] "we wanted to aim high, do something different and big... We knew we had to have a strong Picard story arc, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>are</b> the profound things in a man's life he has to face? Mortality tops the list." [...] After the idea of killing off a Next Generation cast member was vetoed, someone suggested that Kirk die instead. Moore recalled that [...] "we all sorta looked around and said, 'That might be it.' [...] " [...] The studio and Shatner himself had few concerns about the plot point.|$|E
