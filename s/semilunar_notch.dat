5000|$|... #Caption: Upper {{extremity}} of left ulna. Lateral aspect. (<b>Semilunar</b> <b>notch</b> {{visible at}} center top.) ...|$|E
50|$|Its {{upper surface}} is smooth, concave, and forms {{the lower part}} of the <b>semilunar</b> <b>notch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The grooved {{portion of}} the {{articular}} surface fits accurately within the <b>semilunar</b> <b>notch</b> of the ulna; it is broader and deeper on the posterior than on the anterior aspect of the bone, and is inclined obliquely downward and forward toward the medial side.|$|E
5000|$|... {{trochlea}} of the humerus, at {{the right}} side elbow as a hinge joint with <b>semilunar</b> trochlear <b>notch</b> of the ulna.|$|R
50|$|Near the elbow, the ulna has two curved processes, the {{olecranon}} and the coronoid process; and two concave, articular cavities, the <b>semilunar</b> and radial <b>notches.</b>|$|R
50|$|The trochlear notch (also <b>semilunar</b> <b>notch,</b> {{or greater}} sigmoid cavity) {{is a large}} {{depression}} in the upper extremity of the ulna that fits the trochlea of the humerus (the bone directly above the ulna in the arm) {{as part of the}} elbow joint. It is formed by the olecranon and the coronoid process.|$|E
50|$|The <b>semilunar</b> <b>notch</b> {{is a large}} depression, {{formed by}} the {{olecranon}} and the coronoid process, and serving as articulation with the trochlea of the humerus. About the middle of either side of this notch is an indentation, which contracts it somewhat, and indicates the junction of the olecranon and the coronoid process. The notch is concave from above downward, and divided into a medial and a lateral portion by a smooth ridge running from {{the summit of the}} olecranon to the tip of the coronoid process. The medial portion is the larger, and is slightly concave transversely; the lateral is convex above, slightly concave below.|$|E
50|$|The ulna {{is a long}} bone. The long, narrow {{medullary}} cavity of the ulna is {{enclosed in}} a strong wall of cortical tissue which is thickest along the interosseous border and dorsal surface. At the extremities the compact layer thins. The compact layer is continued {{onto the back of}} the olecranon as a plate of close spongy bone with lamellæ parallel. From the inner surface of this plate and the compact layer below it trabeculæ arch forward toward the olecranon and coronoid and cross other trabeculæ, passing backward over the medullary cavity from {{the upper part of the}} shaft below the coronoid. Below the coronoid process there is a small area of compact bone from which trabeculæ curve upward to end obliquely to the surface of the <b>semilunar</b> <b>notch</b> which is coated with a thin layer of compact bone. The trabeculæ at the lower end have a more longitudinal direction.|$|E
50|$|The ulnar {{collateral}} ligament (UCL, {{also known}} as medial collateral ligament) {{is located on the}} medial side of the elbow. The UCL complex comprises three ligaments: the anterior oblique, posterior oblique and transverse ligaments. The anterior oblique ligament (AOL) attaches from the undersurface of the medial epicondyle to the medial ulnar surface slightly below the coronoid process. It is the sturdiest of the three sections within the UCL. The AOL acts as the primary restraint against valgus stress at the elbow during flexion and extension. The posterior oblique originates at the medial epicondyle and inserts along the mid-portion of the medial <b>semilunar</b> <b>notch.</b> It applies more stability against valgus stress when the elbow is flexed rather than extended. The transverse ligament connects to the inferior medial coronoid process of the ulna to the medial tip of the olecranon. Since it is connected to the same bone and not across the elbow joint, the transverse ligament has no contribution to the joint’s stability.|$|E
50|$|The {{olecranon}} is a large, thick, curved eminence, {{situated at}} the upper and back part of the ulna. It is bent forward at the summit so as to present a prominent lip which is received into the olecranon fossa of the humerus in extension of the forearm. Its base is contracted where it joins {{the body and the}} narrowest part of {{the upper end of the}} ulna. Its posterior surface, directed backward, is triangular, smooth, subcutaneous, and covered by a bursa. Its superior surface is of quadrilateral form, marked behind by a rough impression for the insertion of the triceps brachii; and in front, near the margin, by a slight transverse groove for the attachment of part of the posterior ligament of the elbow-joint. Its anterior surface is smooth, concave, and forms the upper part of the <b>semilunar</b> <b>notch.</b> Its borders present continuations of the groove on the margin of the superior surface; they serve for the attachment of ligaments: the back part of the ulnar collateral ligament medially, and the posterior ligament laterally. From the medial border a part of the flexor carpi ulnaris arises; while to the lateral border the Anconæus is attached.|$|E
50|$|The coronoid {{process is}} a {{triangular}} eminence projecting forward from the upper and front part of the ulna. Its base is continuous with {{the body of the}} bone, and of considerable strength. Its apex is pointed, slightly curved upward, and in flexion of the forearm is received into the coronoid fossa of the humerus. Its upper surface is smooth, concave, and forms {{the lower part of the}} <b>semilunar</b> <b>notch.</b> Its antero-inferior surface is concave, and marked by a rough impression for the insertion of the brachialis. At the junction of this surface with the front of the body is a rough eminence, the tuberosity of the ulna, which gives insertion to a part of the brachialis; to the lateral border of this tuberosity the oblique cord is attached. Its lateral surface presents a narrow, oblong, articular depression, the radial notch. Its medial surface, by its prominent, free margin, serves for the attachment of part of the ulnar collateral ligament. At the front part of this surface is a small rounded eminence for the origin of one head of the Flexor digitorum sublimis; behind the eminence is a depression for part of the origin of the flexor digitorum profundus; descending from the eminence is a ridge which gives origin to one head of the pronator teres. Frequently, the flexor pollicis longus arises from the lower part of the coronoid process by a rounded bundle of muscular fibers.|$|E

40|$|Feline Osteoarthritis (OA) is a {{pathological}} change of a diarthrodial articulation which primarily occurs in older cats. The aims {{of this study}} were:- 1) to define the radiographic features of OA in the cat for each individual appendicular joint; 2) to relate the radiographic features to the gross pathologic and histopathologic features; 3) to explore underlying causes of OA in cats, 4) to identify the presence of Protease Activated Receptor- 2 (PAR- 2) and matriptase in feline articular cartilage and synovial membrane and to determine their role in OA pathogenesis. The present study has defined five radiographic features of OA for each appendicular joint:- presence of osteophytes, enthesiophytes, areas of abnormal mineralisation,synovial effusion and joint remodelling. The study furthermore suggested that increases in radio-opacity beneath the <b>semilunar</b> <b>notch,</b> along the femoral trochlea, beneath the tibial plateau and on the femoral head/neck are also important radiographic features. The radiographic prevalence was highest in the elbow (23. 9...|$|E
