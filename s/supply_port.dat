5|$|On 18 April the Mediterranean Fleet sortied to bombard {{the primary}} Axis <b>supply</b> <b>port</b> of Tripoli and was {{attacked}} {{by a pair of}} torpedo-carrying SM.79s from Rhodes. They were intercepted by a pair of Fulmars that damaged one bomber badly enough that it crash-landed back at its base, although one Fulmar was also forced to crash-land aboard Formidable. The next day Fulmars from 806 Squadron shot down one CANT Z.1007 bomber flying from Cyrenica to Sicily and a pair of Junkers Ju 52 transports flying fuel to North Africa. On the morning of 21 April, the carrier's aircraft dropped flares to illuminate the port so it could be shelled by three battleships and a light cruiser. On the way home, a pair of Fulmars shot down a Dornier Do 24 flying boat.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of within-die process variation {{and its impact}} on product yield has increased significantly with scaling. Within-die variation is typically monitored by embedding characterization circuits in product chips. In this work, we propose a minimally-invasive, low-overhead technique for characterizing within-die variation. The pro-posed technique monitors within-die variation by measur-ing quiescent (IDDQ) currents at multiple power <b>supply</b> <b>ports</b> during wafer-probe test. We show that the spatially distributed nature of power ports enables spatial observa-tion of process variation. We demonstrate our methodology on an experimental test-chip fabricated in 65 -nm technol-ogy. The measurement results show that the IDDQ currents drawn by multiple power <b>supply</b> <b>ports</b> correlate very wel...|$|R

5|$|On 16 December 1944, Germany made a last {{attempt on}} the Western Front by using most of its {{remaining}} reserves to launch a massive counter-offensive in the Ardennes and along the French–German border to split the Western Allies, encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and capture their primary <b>supply</b> <b>port</b> at Antwerp to prompt a political settlement. By January, the offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled. In Italy, the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line. In mid-January 1945, the Soviets and Poles attacked in Poland, pushing from the Vistula to the Oder river in Germany, and overran East Prussia. On 4 February, Soviet, British and US leaders met for the Yalta Conference. They agreed on the occupation of post-war Germany, and on when the Soviet Union would join the war against Japan.|$|E

25|$|During the {{invasion}} of mainland Italy in late 1943, beginning the Italian Campaign, 55 HAA Rgt at first remained in Sicily defending Augusta. Later, as the Allied armies advanced, the AA units followed to protect vital airfields and ports in the rear. 55th HAA Regiment crossed from Italy to join 52 AA Bde stationed at the airfield complex around Foggia. It later moved to 66 AA Bde supporting the advance of US Fifth Army particularly the Salerno bridgehead and airfields. After the breakout from Anzio in May 1944, 66 AA Bde took over that area, and then followed Fifth Army up the west coast through Rome until it reached Livorno, where 55 HAA Rgt defended the important <b>supply</b> <b>port.</b> During the winter of 1944–45, 55th HAA Rgt was transferred to 12 AA Bde, supporting British Eighth Army.|$|E

25|$|On 20 January, the 1st Cavalry Division {{began moving}} 350km north from Landing Zone English in Bình Định Province to Camp Evans {{as part of}} Operation Checkers. While the {{helicopters}} and men of the Division were soon in position, most of their heavy and support equipment was loaded on trucks {{that would have to}} proceed by convoy up Highway 1. While a new <b>supply</b> <b>port</b> was being constructed on the coast, the Division relied on the Marine supply line at Tân Mỹ Base and supply convoys along Highway 1 from Da Nang. On the night of 31 January, the PAVN/VC launched a mortar attack on Camp Evans which caused an ammunition dump to explode, disabling most of the helicopters of the 229th Assault Helicopter Battalion. Other attacks along Highway 1 damaged or destroyed 20 bridges and 26 culverts between the Hải Vân Pass and Phu Bai and Highway 1 was closed to convoy traffic until early March.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, the Germans now {{had certain}} advantages. In {{military}} terms, {{it is easier}} to defend a fixed line than it is to take one by storm. They were now fighting in defence of their own frontiers, and this stiffened resolve. They no longer had to deal with partisans sabotaging their supply lines, and they were close to their own sources of supply in Germany. The Allies on the other hand had severe logistical problems, with their supply lines running {{all the way back to}} the Normandy beaches. The great port of Antwerp was in their hands, but the Germans still controlled the mouth of the Scheldt, so the Allies cound not use it as a <b>supply</b> <b>port.</b> In September the American tank armies in Lorraine literally ran out of fuel, and during October the Allied offensive gradually lost momentum and came to a halt on a line well west of the German border in most sectors, although the frontier city of Aachen fell on 21 October. With the failure of the British attempt to force a crossing of the Rhine at Arnhem (Operation Market Garden) in late September, the chance of invading Germany before the winter set in was lost, and Rundstedt was given time to consolidate his position.|$|E

Condor was to reinforce Seeadler and Cormoran was to continue on to the Pacific, but the latter remained in the area temporarily to strengthen the German naval force in the region. This was done both to observe the damage to German economic interests in Moçambique and as {{a show of force}} to prevent British encroachment on Delagoa Bay, which was the only <b>supply</b> <b>port</b> for the independent Transvaal. In January 1895, Condor took over Seeadlers role on the East African coast.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} re-conceptualization of the <b>port</b> <b>supply</b> chain as a smart service system, in {{accordance}} with the theory of service science.

The methodology used is the case study approach. The Authors examined the Port of Salerno (Italy) and re-conceptualized it as a smart port service system. The originality of the work lies in the application of service science as a lens to re-conceptualize the <b>port</b> <b>supply</b> chain, that allows the implementation of a logistic framework. Both theoretical and practical implications are provided to enrich the literature about <b>port</b> <b>supply</b> chains and to support port operators...|$|R
