5|$|On 13–14 November, Ferdinand of Bavaria (Ernst's brother) and the Count of Arenberg {{took the}} Elector's castle at Poppelsdorf; on 18 November, {{they moved to}} attack the Godesburg. This {{fortress}} was considerably stronger than the one at Poppelsdorf and of supreme <b>strategic</b> <b>importance</b> for the projected attack on Bonn, {{the capital city of}} the Electorate.|$|E

5|$|At Banagher, {{there are}} ridges {{on both sides}} of the river and roads were built along these many centuries ago. The first bridge was built over the Shannon at that point as early as 1049. It was a place of great <b>strategic</b> <b>importance</b> because the Shannon and its {{lowlands}} provided a natural barrier between Connacht and Leinster. An army that wanted to cross the river had few choices; apart from Banagher, the only other suitable places were Athlone, Shannonbridge and Portumna.|$|E
5|$|Battleships {{played a}} part in major engagements in Atlantic, Pacific and Mediterranean theaters; in the Atlantic, the Germans used their battleships as {{independent}} commerce raiders. However, clashes between battleships were of little <b>strategic</b> <b>importance.</b> The Battle of the Atlantic was fought between destroyers and submarines, and most of the decisive fleet clashes of the Pacific war were determined by aircraft carriers.|$|E

5|$|Development of the {{military}} settlement at Tvrđa started in 1687 when the Habsburg armies drove the Ottomans {{out of the city}} during the Great Turkish War. The chief commander of the Imperial army, Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden, saw Osijek as a location of exceptional <b>strategic</b> <b>importance</b> in the war against the Ottomans. He urged the repair of the city walls, and proposed construction of a new fort according to Vauban's principles of military engineering.|$|E
5|$|Having {{failed to}} take Caen through {{successive}} flanking manoeuvres, Montgomery decided the next attack would be a frontal assault. Although Caen's <b>strategic</b> <b>importance</b> had vastly diminished since D-Day, he sought control of Bourguébus and the commanding high ground to the south. On 5 July the orders for Operation Charnwood were issued; {{it was to be}} launched at 04:20, {{an hour and a half}} before dawn on 8 July.|$|E
5|$|The castle's layout {{was unusual}} for the region during this period, where the fortifications built by the Normans were {{typically}} smaller ringwork designs, and it highlighted both the <b>strategic</b> <b>importance</b> of the location {{and the power of}} its builder. In scale and design it was similar to the initial version of Rochester Castle, another major fortification built by Odo in England.|$|E

5|$|The {{importance}} of Lamu in the Lamu Archipelago grew {{at the expense}} of Pate {{in the years that followed}} the fort's construction. The Sultan used Lamu Fort as a base for defeating the Mazrui rebels in Mombasa, and for establishing control over the East African coast. He moved the capital of his sultanate to Zanzibar. With its <b>strategic</b> <b>importance</b> lost, Lamu soon declined in economic importance in comparison to Mombasa and Zanzibar.|$|E
5|$|The main {{wall on the}} sea-facing side of Dubrovnik {{stretches}} from Fort Bokar {{in the west to}} St. John Fortress in the south, and to the Revelin Fortress on the land-side. These walls are 1.5 to 5 meters (5–16feet) thick, depending on their location and its <b>strategic</b> <b>importance.</b> The purpose of these walls were to help defend the city from sea-based attacks, particularly from the Republic of Venice, which was often considered a threat to Dubrovnik's safety.|$|E
5|$|The {{siege of}} Lyme Regis was an eight-week {{blockade}} during the First English Civil War. The port of Lyme Regis, in Dorset, {{was considered to}} be of <b>strategic</b> <b>importance</b> because it controlled the main shipping route between Bristol and the English Channel. Thomas Ceeley and Robert Blake commanded the town's Parliamentarian defences during the siege, which was laid by Prince Maurice between 20 April and 16 June 1644.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} {{owner of}} the 13th-century castle was {{a man by the}} name of La Poer, which was eventually anglicised to [...] "Power." [...] The castle's position was of <b>strategic</b> military <b>importance</b> because the castle's owner could control access to the nearby Dargle, Glencree and Glencullen rivers.|$|R
5|$|The sieges of Taunton were {{a series}} of three {{blockades}} during the First English Civil War. The town of Taunton, in Somerset, was considered to be of <b>strategic</b> <b>importance</b> because it controlled the main road from Bristol to Devon and Cornwall. Robert Blake commanded the town's Parliamentarian defences during all three sieges, from September 1644 to July 1645.|$|E
5|$|After the {{economic}} slump of the 1990s, {{the economy of}} the oblast started to rebound during {{the first decade of the}} 2000s, although at a rate below the country's average. Today the Kola Peninsula is the most industrially developed and urbanized region in northern Russia. The major port of the peninsula is Murmansk, which serves as the administrative center of Murmansk Oblast and does not freeze in winter. Although the <b>strategic</b> <b>importance</b> of the Kola Peninsula has diminished since the Cold War, the peninsula nevertheless still has the highest concentration of nuclear weapons, reactors, and facilities in Russia, with the number of nuclear reactors alone exceeding any other region of the world.|$|E
5|$|As the war progressed, Temple was {{promoted}} to colonel and became governor of Tilbury Fort in Essex, a post {{that had previously been}} held by his father. The fort was close to Temple's childhood home at Longhouse Place and was of <b>strategic</b> <b>importance</b> because it controlled the approach to London by river. During the Second Civil War, there were Royalist uprisings in Kent and Essex. Temple's control of Tilbury Fort for Parliament enabled Lord Fairfax's troops to cross from Gravesend to Tilbury on route to Colchester for the siege of royalists in that town.|$|E

5|$|Despite its <b>strategic</b> <b>importance,</b> {{the castle}} and the defences of the Thames and Medway were badly {{neglected}} during the 17th century. The Dutch Republic mounted an unexpected naval raid in June 1667, and the Dutch fleet {{was able to}} breach the defences, capturing two warships and burning others at anchor in the river at Chatham, {{in one of the}} worst defeats suffered by the Royal Navy. Upnor Castle acquitted itself better than many of the other defensive sites along the upper Medway, despite its lack of provisioning. Gun fire from the fort and from adjoining emplacements forced a Dutch retreat after a couple of days, before they were able to burn the dockyard itself.|$|E
5|$|Despite the boasting of Mussolini and {{the fury}} of Churchill, the loss of Tug Argan and {{consequently}} Somaliland was not of the greatest <b>strategic</b> <b>importance.</b> Certainly it was a blow to British prestige and pride, but Somaliland was one of Britain's lesser regions of value and could be affordably lost. In fact, Britain incurred monetary gains after being relieved of the necessity to station an expensive garrison there. But the impact could have been far greater if the Italians had managed to move faster after the battle. Heavy rains and difficulties supplying the troops damaged these efforts, as well as removed any chance of a sizable strategic victory.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Latrun {{comprised}} a detention {{camp and}} a fortified police station {{occupied by the}} British, a Trappist monastery, and several Arab villages: Latrun, Imwas, Dayr Ayyub and Bayt Nuba. During the civil war, {{after the death of}} Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni, the forces of the Arab Liberation Army positioned themselves around the police fort and the surrounding villages, to the indifference of the British. They regularly attacked supply convoys heading for Jerusalem. At that time, neither the Israeli nor Jordanian military staffs had prepared for the <b>strategic</b> <b>importance</b> of the place.|$|E
