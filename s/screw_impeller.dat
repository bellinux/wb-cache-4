40|$|Nowadays, it is {{believed}} that using biomass has more advantages and benefits than using fossil fuels and oils. So, it should be kept in mind that studies around this subject could have impressive effects on the life of humans and even the planet in the future. This thesis describes the effect of impeller types on hydrodynamics and concentration distribution of composite wood pellets suspended in water in a stirred reactor. These effects are studied by conducting several experiments in order to examine three types of impellers; six-bladed Rushton turbine impeller, six-bladed pitched blade impeller and helical <b>screw</b> <b>impeller.</b> Then by measuring torque and impeller speeds, which were followed by estimation of power consumption and energy dissipation rates, the results were analysed and evaluated to figure out the most suitable and beneficial type of impeller, which can be used in industries. At the end of this research, {{it was found that the}} most suitable impeller for this study would be evaluated by parameters such as: power consumption, energy dissipation rates, minimum impeller speed and viscosity...|$|E
40|$|Test {{work was}} {{conducted}} at Hulett Refinery to establish the benefits of using mechanical stirrers in ribbon calandria pansboilingwhitesugar. Initiallytestswere carriedout using an Ekato 5 bladed Kaplan type stirrer and immediate benefits in lowercolour formation and higher yields werefound. Increasing the speed of this stirrer, up to the limit of the shaft design, gave a further improvement in results. In order to improve performance further, a stirrer with a 4 bladed adjustable pitch helical screw propeller was designed to maximise flow rather than back mixing. This, together with a more rigid tubular section shaft allowed experimentation with different blade pitches and rotational speedsup to the maximum poweroutput of the drive motor. The paper discusses the logic behind the design used and provides the resultsobtained during evaluationtestwork. It is concluded that the best results in a ribbon calandriapan were obtained with a 4 bladed helical <b>screw</b> <b>impeller,</b> with a pitch ratio of 0, 8 and a speed of 147 rpm. The testwork showsthat a 60 % reduction in colour formation and an 8 % increase in crystalyield wereachieved when comparedwith an unstirred pan...|$|E
40|$|The vortex-ingesting {{stirred tank}} reactor uses a {{combination}} of a helical <b>screw</b> <b>impeller</b> and concentric draft-tube to entrain and recycle headspace gas and disperse it as bubbles in a liquid reaction solvent. This study presents an experimental characterisation of a 0. 29 m diameter vortex-ingesting gas-liquid stirred reactor, operated with solids mass fractions from 0 to 25 %, over a range of specific power inputs up to 3 W/kg and for a variety of tank geometries. As was found in previous studies the most important geometric variable is the draft-tube top clearance, since this has the most direct effect on the gas ingestion rate. The presence of low solids fractions causes {{a significant increase in the}} minimum speed required for vortex ingestion of the gas. At low impeller speeds and low solids mass fractions, accumulation of particles in the annulus surrounding the draft-tube reduces the pumping capacity of the impeller. This mechanism also reduces the gas holdup and gas-liquid mass transfer coefficient, although not always in a monotonic fashion. In this design of reactor, aeration results in only a small decrease in the specific power input and so the just-suspended condition is not much affected by the presence of gas...|$|E

40|$|South African fly ash {{has been}} shown to be a useful {{feedstock}} for the synthesis of some zeolites. The present study focuses on the effect of impeller design and agitation rates on the synthesis of zeolite Na-P 1 which are critical to the commercialization of this product. The effects of three impeller designs (4 -flat blade, Anchor and Archimedes <b>screw</b> <b>impellers)</b> and three agitation speeds (150, 200 and 300 rpm) were investigated using a modified previously reported synthesis conditions; 48 hours of ageing at 47 °C and static hydrothermal treatment at 140 °C for 48 hours. The experimental results demonstrated that the phase purity of zeolite Na-P 1 was strongly affected by the agitation rate and the type of impeller used during the ageing step of the synthesis process. Although zeolite Na-P 1 was synthesized with a space time yield (STY) of 15 ± 0. 4 kg d− 1 m− 3 and a product yield of 0. 98 ± 0. 05 g zeolites/g fly ash for each impeller at different agitation speeds, zeolite formation was assessed to be fairly unsuccessful in some cases due the occurrence of undissolved mullite and/or the formation of impurities such as hydroxysodalite with the zeolitic product. This study also showed that a high crystalline zeolite Na-P 1 can be synthesized from South African coal fly ash using a 4 -flat blade impeller at an agitation rate of 200 rpm during the ageing step at 47 °C for 48 hours followed by static hydrothermal treatment at 140 °C for 48 hours.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the topic of Pumps with crew centrifugal impeller. Thanks to the benefits such as free passage and efficiency there are many practical applications of these products. Despite this fact there is only few manufacturers dealing with them what results in lack of research and available information in the area. In order to fill the gap, this thesis aims to propose hydraulic of <b>screw</b> centrifugal <b>impeller</b> to the specified parameters. The impeller with a single moving blade will be designed for pumping heavily polluted water and hardly pumpable liquids.

40|$|Models for {{understanding}} the basic concepts of fine grinding and how they apply {{to the design of}} stirred media mills have not yet matured. While spherical media in tower mills has previously been studied, real grinding media shape in stirred mills can range from spherical (steel/ceramic balls) to highly non-spherical (sand or slag) resulting in very different media and grinding dynamics. Handling the contact mechanics of non-spherical particles is a challenge for numerical models, and very few studies dealing with non-spherical particle shape exist in the literature. Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations of dry media flow in a pilot-scale tower mill are performed for four cases with different shaped grinding media, in order to understand how flow and energy utilisation within a stirred mill depend on media shape. Differences in media transport, stress distribution, energy dissipation, and liner wear were observed in the tower mill for the spherical and non-spherical cases. A significant departure from sphericity of the media leads to strong dilation of the bed, reduced bulk density, and a reduction in active volume and collisional power levels leading to a reduction in power draw for the mill. In addition, highly non-spherical media tend to pack tightly near the mill walls forming a near solid layer around the inside of the mill shell which results in poorer transport and mixing, as well as increased wear rates on the <b>screw</b> <b>impeller.</b> Grinding performance in stirred mills appears to deteriorate strongly when using highly non-spherical media...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The low lying {{parts of}} Holland are {{vulnerable}} to flooding and are therefore heavily protected by dykes and several pumping stations. These however cause serious obstacles to migratory fish. Pumping stations can be lethal barriers for fish migration. Currently a lot of pump manufacturers are developing new fish friendly pumps. To fit these new pumps in existing pumping stations, usually civil adjustments are required at considerable costs. A more cost effective alternative would be to perform a fish friendly upgrade of the existing pumps. During the last 3 years Flowserve conducted excessive research to increase their knowledge on fish friendly pump design. This research project led to a comprehensive calculation method to predict survivability rates of fish passing pumps. With this knowledge Flowserve has developed a very cost effective retrofit program to upgrade existing pumping stations equiped with fish unfriendly concrete volute pumps that have open axial flow screw impellers, also known as BVOP pumps. Currently Flowserve has executed several retrofit projects proving fish friendly upgrade possibilities at relatively low costs, lowering the investment threshold to solve fish migration barriers. The presentation will take you along the developments made {{the last three years}} including the full scale in house fish survivability tests performed to validate our developed calculation method. The full scale test involved a total of +/- 1800 fish at 7 different operating conditions. Hereafter we will give you insights on two current projects: • A BVOP retrofit project consisting of a new impeller/wear ring combination that fits the existing pumps without civil adjustment requirements. • The upgrade of 2 fully metal, Stork heritage, open axial flow <b>screw</b> <b>impeller,</b> diffuser pumps. To fit the geometrical constraints of these pumps, a new patented fish friendly diffuser-bend combination was develope...|$|E
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{requirements for}} the degree Magister Technologiae: Chemical Engineering In the FACULTY OF ENGINEERING At the CAPE PENINSULA UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, 2012 The generation of electricity from coal in South Africa results in {{millions of tons of}} fly ash being produced each year. Less than 10 % of the fly ash generated is being used constructively and the remaining unused ash is currently inducing disposal and environmental problems. Intensive research on the utilisation of fly ash has been conducted either to reduce the cost of disposal or to minimise its impact on the environment. It has been shown that South African fly ash {{can be used as a}} feedstock for zeolite synthesis due to its compositional dominance of aluminosilicate and silicate phases. Most of the studies conducted on zeolite synthesis using South African fly ash are performed on small laboratory scale. Therefore, production of zeolites on an industrial/pilot plant scale would, in addition to producing a valuable product, help abate the pollution caused by the disposal of fly ash in the country. This research focuses on the investigation of the scale-up opportunity of zeolite synthesis from South African fly ashes with the view of understanding the effects of some reactor and operational parameters on the quality of the zeolite produced. Two types of zeolites (zeolite Na-P 1 and zeolite A) were synthesised via two different routes in this study: (1) a two stage hydrothermal synthesis method (zeolite Na-P 1) and (2) alkaline fusion prior to hydrothermal synthesis (zeolite A). The synthesis variables evaluated in this study were; the effect of impeller design and agitation rates during the aging step (zeolite Na-P 1) using three different impellers (anchor, 4 -flat-blade and Archimedes <b>screw</b> <b>impeller)</b> at three agitation speeds (150, 200 and 300 rpm), the effect of fly ash composition and solvents (water sources) on the phase purity of both zeolite Na-P 1 and zeolite A, and the effect of the hydrothermal reaction time during the synthesis of zeolite Na-P 1 using low amorphous phase fly ash i. e. aging time (12 - 48 hours) and hydrothermal treatment time (12 - 48 hours). The raw materials (fly ashes from Arnot, Hendrina, Tutuka, Lethabo and Matla power stations) and the synthesised zeolite product were characterised chemically, mineralogically and morphologically by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, X-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Other characterisation techniques used in the study were 1) Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to provide structural information and also monitor the evolution of the zeolite crystals during synthesis and 2) inductively coupled plasma atomic emission (ICP-AES) and mass spectrometry for multi-elemental analysis of the synthesis solution and the solvents used in this study. The experimental results demonstrated that the phase purity of zeolite Na-P 1 was strongly affected by agitation and the type of impeller used during the aging step of the synthesis process. A high crystalline zeolite Na-P 1 was obtained with a 4 -flat-blade impeller at a low agitation rate of 200 rpm. Although a pure phase of zeolite Na-P 1 was obtained at low agitation rates, the variation in the mineralogy of the fly ash was found to affect the quality of the zeolite produced significantly. The results suggested that each batch of fly ash would require a separate optimisation process of the synthesis conditions. Therefore, there is a need to develop a database of the synthesis conditions for zeolite Na-P 1 based on the fly ash composition. As a consequence, the scale-up synthesis of zeolite Na-P 1 would require step-by-step optimisation of the synthesis conditions, since this zeolite was sensitive to the SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio, agitation and the mineralogy of the fly ash. On the other hand, zeolite A synthesis had several advantages over zeolite Na-P 1. The results suggested that a pure phase of zeolite A can be produced at very low reaction temperature (i. e. below 100 °C, compared to 140 °C for zeolite Na-P 1), shorter reaction times (i. e. less than 8 hours compared to 4 days for zeolite Na-P 1), with complete dissolution of fly ash phases and more importantly less sensitive to the SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio of the raw materials. The zeolite A synthesis process was found to be more robust and as a result, it would be less rigorous to scale-up despite the energy requirements for fusion. This study showed for the first time that different impeller designs and agitation during the aging step can have a profound impact on the quality of the zeolite produced. Therefore, it is not only the hydrothermal synthesis conditions and the molar regime but also the dissolution kinetics of the feedstock that influence the outcome of the zeolite synthesis process. This study has also shown for the first time that a pure phase of zeolite A can be synthesised from various sources of South African fly ash containing different mineralogical and chemical compositions via the alkali fusion method under the same synthesis conditions. Therefore, the effective zeolitisation of fly ash on a large scale would assist to mitigate the depletion of resources and environmental problems caused by the disposal of fly ash...|$|E
40|$|Understanding of {{particle}} flow behaviour {{as a function}} of strain rate is of great interest in many items of equipment of industrial processes, such as <b>screw</b> conveyors, <b>impeller</b> mixers, and feeders, etc. The traditional commercial instruments for bulk powder flow characterisation, such as shear cells, operate at low shear strain rates, and are not representative of unit operations under dynamic conditions. In recent years, the FT 4 powder rheometer of Freeman Technology has emerged as a widely used technique for characterising particle flow under dynamic conditions of shear strain rate; yet little is known about its underlying powder mechanics. We analyse the effect of gas flow on the flow behaviour of cohesionless particles in FT 4 both experimentally and by numerical simulations using the combined discrete element method (DEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The results show that the effect of gas flow on the flow energy could be described by the resultant fluid-induced drag on the particles above the blade position as the impeller penetrates the bed. The strain rate in front of the blade is mainly determined by the impeller tip speed, and is not sensitive to the gas flow and particle size. The flow energy correlates well with the shear stress in front of the blade. They both increase with the strain rate and are significantly reduced by the upward gas flow...|$|R

40|$|Mixing has {{the most}} common {{occurrence}} in process industries like chemical, food and polymer and plays a significant part in overall success of the processes. Stirred tanks are commonly used for mixing various types of Newtonian and non-Newtonian liquids. Impeller is the movable part and is used as the rotating device in stirred tank systems for achieving mixing. An impeller while it rotates imparts shear force in the vicinity along the peripheral zone. Literature is rich with information on various experimental and theoretical findings on the hydrodynamics and mixing behaviour of Newtonian fluids in stirred tank systems. However, with non-Newtonian fluids, limited published literature {{is available on the}} hydrodynamic behaviour of the mixing process in stirred vessels. A few available experimental works in literatures successfully explained the mixing process in a non-Newtonian system using Rushton turbine (impeller commonly used in industry). But unavailability of the theoretical prediction of the same is basically explains the motivation behind the study on the mixing of non-Newtonian fluids in stirred tank with Rushton turbine. For mixing highly viscous liquids, helical ribbon impellers are most suited. In this thesis work, it was aimed to study the computational aspects of the hydrodynamic performance of helical ribbon impeller in a highly viscous non-Newtonian system and comparing the results with helical <b>screw</b> ribbon <b>impeller</b> through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. Entropy generation minimization study {{is an integral part of}} this thesis work. Mostly, the earlier works involve use of analytical expressions from basics of mass, energy and entropy balance which has got certain limitations because of many assumptions. Here, we aimed for a detailed numerical study on the same. Also, the understanding of residence time distribution (RTD) study in a stirred tank system gives an idea on the distribution of flow structure. Although, this particular aspect has been studied by various research groups, however, some of the experimental data are not compared with numerical findings for validation. In this work it was aimed to predict RTD numerically especially by using swept volume of the impeller into consideration. A computational fluid dynamics study using Ansys Fluent was carried out to determine the mixing performance of a tank stirred with Rushton turbine. The predicted profiles of the velocity components were validated with literature data. The non-parametric Spearman’s rank order test was used to find the interaction of velocity profiles with the impeller Reynolds number and flow behavior index. The characteristic performance parameters such as power number and flow number of the impeller were predicted. The variations of entropy generation due to only viscous dissipation with Reynolds number, tank geometry, etc. were calculated for the isothermal tank. The entropy generation minimization (EGM) approach was used to optimize the performance of the non-isothermal continuous stirred tank with respect to the system parameters like inlet Reynolds number, impeller speed, and impeller clearance and impeller blade width. The numerical study of the stirred tank with helical ribbon (HR) and helical ribbon with <b>screw</b> (HRS) <b>impellers</b> was carried out successfully. The CFD models were successfully validated with the experimental power number given in literature. The power constant for Newtonian fluid (Kp) and non-Newtonian fluid (Kp(n)) were calculated and compared successfully with the literature data. The Metzner Otto or geometry constant, Ks were computed following four different methods and the best one was identified by predicting successfully the generalized power curve. The flow numbers of HRS impeller were predicted for wide range of impeller Reynolds number. The non-dimensional mixing times were varied in scattered way with impeller Reynolds number, and the dispersive flow away from the impeller shaft was observed. The entropy generations were increased with the impeller Reynolds number, and an empirical model of entropy generation with impeller Reynolds number was developed. The non-isothermal stirred tank with HR and HRS impellers were optimized employing the entropy generation minimization technique. The hydrodynamic and the residence time distribution (RTD) behavior of the viscous Newtonian fluid was studied using a tracer age distribution function, I(θ). The experimental tracer age distribution functions were predicted by CFD tools using tracer injection and swept volume methods. The predicted results were found in good agreement with the literature data. The mixing behaviour was changed from dispersion to ideal mixing state with increasing the tank Reynolds number and impeller rotations. The mixing performance parameters like holdback, segregation, number of ideal continuous stirred tank in series equivalent to single actual continuous stirred tank were also calculated to identify the necessary flow parameters and their magnitude to obtain the ideal flow distribution in the tank. ...|$|R
