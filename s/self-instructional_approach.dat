One treatment, approximating Carkhuffs training method, employed didactic teaching, discrimination training, modeling, experientially-oriented comitunications practice, and feedback. The second treatment, a cognitive <b>self-instructional</b> modeling <b>approach,</b> included each of these components plus the behavioral rehearsal of the thought process leading to an effective empathy response. Although the thought process was observed and practiced orally, the overt-verbalizations were faded to covert behaviors by the end of treatment. The dependeat measures consisted of pretest and posttest empathy ratings of responses to videotaped emotional stimuli. A repeated measures analysis of variance was employed on the data. Although both treatments showed substantial gains on empathy from pretest to posttest, the cognitive self-instructional group gained significantly more in their empathy ratings than did the Carkhuff group. Implications of the results were discussed. (Author...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUsing Self-Instructional Modules {{within the}} {{technical}} {{education can be}} an alternative approach and make significant contributions. Modules are not just “job sheets’ or “old style work units” or “chapters of books” with questions added. Module is a planned series of learning activities designed carefully to assist the learners to accomplish certain specific objectives. An attempt {{to develop and implement}} a modular approach on Buzan mind mapping techniques was made in the secondary school. A quasi-experimental design research has been carried out to affirm the effectiveness of this module in test achievement among the students. This paper will discuss various components of this modular approach by referring to Meyer Model. Statistical analysis was done via an “intention to treat” comparison of post intervention scores and comparison of the change in scores from pre- to post intervention, using a two-sample t-test. Students participating in the <b>self-instructional</b> modular <b>approach</b> had a significant improvement in knowledge scores compared to non-participants...|$|R
40|$|The National Council of Associations for International Studies, {{composed}} of 11 regional associations encompassing over 400 U.

40|$|OBJETIVO: Verificar o efeito da aplicação de dois procedimentos de educação (auto-instrucional e tradicional associado às oficinas de educação) na freqüência de sintomas musculoesqueléticos percebidos. MÉTODOS: Realizou-se um estudo quase-experimental, com 94 funcionários administrativos de uma empresa pública, alocados em três grupos por amostragem aleatória simples e sem reposição, sendo um do Tradicional/Oficinas (32), um de Manual Auto-instrucional (28) e o Controle (34). Mensurou-se a freqüência de sintomas musculoesqueléticos por meio do questionário Nórdico de Sintomas Músculo-esqueléticos, no início e após 30 dias do término dos programas. Utilizou-se a estatística descritiva, a técnica de variância não-paramétrica para o modelo de medidas repetidas em três grupos independentes e o teste de Goodman. RESULTADOS: Pelos dados obtidos na comparação do pré e pós-teste, observa-se que o programa de educação baseado em tradicional e oficinas reduziu significativamente a freqüência de sintomas musculoesqueléticos, nos últimos sete dias. Nos Grupos Controle e do Manual Auto-instrucional, não se observou diferença na freqüência dos sintomas musculoesqueléticos. CONCLUSÕES: Pode-se concluir que as intervenções, principalmente o tradicional associado a oficinas, teve efeito positivo sobre as ações dos indivíduos e, apesar da complexidade de algumas medidas preventivas necessárias, houve uma diminuição dos sintomas musculoesqueléticos dos usuários no trabalho. OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} applying two educational programs (one using a <b>self-instructional</b> <b>approach</b> and the other using a traditional approach similar to educational workshops), on the perceived frequency of musculoskeletal symptoms. METHODS: A quasi-experimental {{study was conducted in}} 94 office workers in a public company. The participants were divided into three groups through simple randomized sampling with no replacement. The first group (32 employees) underwent a traditional/workshop program, the second (28) used a self-instructional manual and the third (34) was a Control Group. The frequency of musculoskeletal symptoms was measured by means of the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire, {{at the beginning of the}} program and 30 days after its completion. The statistical analysis consisted of descriptive statistics, a nonparametric analysis of variance technique for a repeated measure model in three independent groups and the Goodman test. RESULTS: From the data collected in pre and post-test comparisons, it was observed that the traditional/workshop educational program significantly reduced the frequency of musculoskeletal symptoms over the final seven days. For the self-instructional manual group and control group, no difference was observed in the frequency of musculoskeletal symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: It could be concluded that the interventions, particularly the traditional approach using educational workshops, had a positive effect on the individuals' actions. Despite the complexity of some of the preventive measures needed, there was a reduction in musculoskeletal symptoms of the participants during work...|$|E
40|$|Higher order {{thinking}} skills (HOTS) is an imperative aspect {{in teaching and}} learning especially at higher education institutions. Students with higher order {{thinking skills}} are able {{to find new ways to}} solve their daily problems and make appropriate decisions. Hence, the purpose of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of HOTS for generating idea among technical students. This quantitative approach research used the quasi-experimental design with one treatment groups and one control group comprising 81 students. Marzano HOTS was used for generating idea in this research. Meanwhile, individual assignment evaluation rubric was modified to assess the level of achievement on the students’ assignments. The findings showed that there was significant differences between treatment group and control group on the overall individual post assignment result. There were significant differences between treatment group and control group on the five evaluation criteria of individual post assignment result. Besides that, the findings revealed that treatment group have significant differences between individual pre and post assignment on overall and five evaluation criteria result. Consequently, learning HOTS by using <b>self-instructional</b> manual <b>approach</b> for generating ideas is significantly effective...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Problem: The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} interactions between learner characteristics and instructional settings and their affect on retention of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR.) competency [...] An effort was made to determine if college students identified as Independent or Dependent-Conforming learners interacted with traditional or self-instructional CPR educational modes. At the conclusion of the course, the initial interaction effect was investigated to obtain data that would later be used as a statistical covariant for retention analysis. The final concern of this study was the investigation of the affect on initial learning and retention of the Basic Life Support competency when groups were compared either by learning orientation or by instructional approach. Method: The sample for the study consisted of 128 randomly-selected college students who had registered for Health Science 161, Basic Life Support and Health Selence 160, Emergency Procedures. These classes were conducted at California State University, Northridge during the spring semeaten, 1978. The California Psychological Inventory (Sections 13, 14) Achievement via Conformence (Ac), Achievement via Independence (Ai), and Rotter's Locus of Control were used to identify the students' learning orientation. This study used both a four-group and a two-group experimental design. The interaction study used four research cells of equal size. Independent learners were taught using both the traditional and <b>self-instructional</b> <b>approaches.</b> Dependent-Conforming learners were taught using these same two approaches. All groups were tested upon the completion of the course and retested six months later using identical procedures. The two hypotheses developed to examine learning and retention related to learner traits were tested using a one-way analysis of variance and a one-way analysis of covariance. The same statistical tools were used to test for differences between instructional methods related to learning and retention. Finally, the two hypotheses investigating interaction affect on immediate learning and decay of competency used two-way, fixed models of analysis of variance and covariance, respectively. The American National Red Cross written examination, performance protocol test and a print-out from a Recording Resusci Anne were used to measure cognitive understanding and psychomotor proficiency. Data collected with the instruments were evaluated separately and in combination to determine what differences, if any, existed between learner groups or instructional modes. In addition, separate and over-all testing protocol mean scores were examined to find possible differences among groups based on interaction effect. Statistical significansc was set at the. 05 confidence level for all hypotheses. Results: Neither the instructional approach nor the learning orientation appears to affect the initial learning and/or retention of the CPR competency as measured by the previously identified instruments. However, a significant difference was found in written examination scores when instructional methods were compared. The self-instructional system proved to be a superior method for insuring better cognitive learning and retention. There was no initial interaction effect among groups; however, a difference was found among the groups when retention was explored. Dependent-Conforming learners, taught in the traditional setting, showed better retention scores and less decay of the over-all CPR competency than Independent learners taught in the same mode. Conclusions: Evaluation of written examination mean scores showed the self-instructional system to be a superior approach to obtain and retain cognitive knowledge. The results of the study indicate that interaction does occur between independent and dependent learning characteristics and the traditional method of CFR instruction when the passage of time is an added variable...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the remediation and assessment of everyday memory impairment {{in a sample of}} long-term acquired brain injury (ABI) subjects. The Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT) and subtests of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) were selected to measure global memory performance. A memory questionnaire and a daily memory checklist were developed from a review of existing self-report questionnaires. The interrelationships among self-report measures and standardized psychometric tests of memory were examined and the findings suggest that self-report measures may be used to obtain relatively accurate information about everyday memory performance. A baseline across groups 2 ̆ 7 design evaluated the relative effectiveness of two different approaches in training subjects to use a diary to compensate for memory problems. There was a Diary Only (DO) approach, which emphasized compensation based upon task specific learning, and a Diary and <b>Self-instructional</b> Training (DSIT) <b>approach,</b> which taught compensation using higher cognitive skills of self-awarenes and self-regulation. The results obtained show that, during the treatment phase, the DSIT group more consistently made diary entries, reported less memory problems, and made more positive ratings associated with treatment efficacy. The implications arising from the current study are that: (1) the choice of memory assessment procedures need to be guided by the patients 2 ̆ 7 real daily living needs; and (2) an <b>approach</b> based upon <b>self-instructional</b> training has greater ecological validity than an approach that focuses on task specific learning.
