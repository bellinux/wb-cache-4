25|$|A higher {{cracking}} temperature (also {{referred to}} as severity) favors the production of ethene and benzene, whereas lower severity produces higher amounts of propene, C4-hydrocarbons and liquid products. The process also results in the slow deposition of coke, a form of carbon, on the reactor walls. This degrades {{the efficiency of the}} reactor, so reaction conditions are designed to minimize this. Nonetheless, a <b>steam</b> <b>cracking</b> <b>furnace</b> can usually only run for a few months at a time between de-cokings. Decokes require the furnace to be isolated from the process and then a flow of steam or a steam/air mixture is passed through the furnace coils. This converts the hard solid carbon layer to carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. Once this reaction is complete, the furnace can be returned to service.|$|E

40|$|Nonuniform {{temperature}} fields in <b>steam</b> <b>cracking</b> <b>furnaces</b> caused by geometry {{factors such as}} burner positions, shadow effects, and asymmetry of the reactor coil layout are detrimental for product yields and run lengths. The techniques of adjusting burner firing (zone firing) and feedstock mass flow rate (pass balancing) have been practiced industrially to mitigate these effects but could only reduce the nonuniformities between the so-called modules (a group of many coils). An extension of the pass balancing methodology is presented to further minimize the intra-module nonuniformities, that is, variation between the coils within a module, in floor fired furnaces. Coupled furnace-reactor computational fluid dynamics-based simulations of an industrial ultraselective conversion (USC) furnace were performed to evaluate four different feedstock flow distribution schemes, realizing equal values for coil outlet temperature, propene/ethene mass ratio, maximum coking rate and maximum tube metal temperature (TMT), respectively, over all the reactor coils. It is shown that feedstock flow distribution creates a larger operating window and extends the run length. Out of the four cases, the coking rate as criterion leads to the highest yearly production capacity for ethene and propene. Uniform maximum coking rates boost the annual production capacity of the USC furnace with a nameplate ethene capacity of 130 103 metric tons per year with 1000 metric tons for ethene and 730 metric tons for propene. For industrial application, achieving uniform maximum TMT is more practical due to its measurability by advanced laser-based techniques.

However, the impact of using different radiation models in coupled furnace/reactor simulations has never been evaluated before. Therefore, coupled furnace/reactor simulations of an industrial naphtha <b>cracking</b> <b>furnace</b> with a 130 kt/a capacity have been conducted. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed for the furnace side, while the one-dimensional reactor model COILSIM 1 D {{was used for the}} reactor simulations.

The results with DOM and DTRM are very similar both on the furnace and the reactor sides. The flue gas temperature using DOM is higher than when using the P- 1 radiation model, resulting in higher incident radiation. Comparing the simulated results of all radiation models to the industrial product yields and run lengths shows that DOM and DTRM outperform the others.

40|$|Ethylene and propylene, also {{referred}} to as light olefins, are important building blocks within the chemical industry and are used for the production of plastics. They are usually produced via <b>steam</b> <b>cracking</b> of naphtha or other light fractions of petroleum. This process route is a very energy consuming process and consumes non-renewable feedstock and will thus not be sustainable in the long run. Fossil feedstock can be replaced with biomass. Methanol is produced from biomass via gasification and methanol synthesis and then light olefins are produced in a Methanol-to-olefins (MTO) process. Replacing some of the olefins produced today via <b>steam</b> <b>cracking</b> at Borealis in Stenungsund with olefins produced via the MTO process is a first shift towards more sustainable production processes. The consequences of integrating the MTO process with the existing cracker plant as well as integrating the complete process chain from biomass to olefins with the existing cracker plant have been evaluated based on the potential for heat integration and the potential to produce high pressure steam. The potential for high pressure steam production is particularly relevant given the loss of high pressure steam production from the cracker furnaces when reducing their capacity. Energy- and mass balances were obtained by creating simulation models for the MTO process as well as the biomass to methanol process. The energy balances obtained were used as input data for a heat integration study using pinch analysis. The opportunities for heat integration with the existing cracker plant were evaluated for different cases. The first case was restricted to heat integration opportunities for the MTO process only. The second case included heat integration opportunities for the complete process chain from biomass to olefins. From the simulation models an energy yield from biomass to methanol of 0. 51 MW/MW was obtained, which is similar to other published studies of this process. The yield going from methanol to olefins was based on yield data for the UOP/Hydro technology. The heat integration for the MTO and steam cracker case indicates {{that it is possible to}} transfer approximately 11. 6 MW from the cracker process to the MTO process. Furthermore, it is possible to produce approximately 18 MW of high pressure steam from excess heat from the MTO process, which is not enough to cover the reduced production of high pressure <b>steam</b> from the <b>cracking</b> <b>furnaces.</b> In the biomass to olefins process, heat integration with the steam cracker shows opportunities to recover approximately 22 MW of process heat and produce 175 MW of high pressure steam, which would be enough to cover the loss in high pressure steam production...|$|R

30|$|Generally, {{cracking}} {{technology is}} one of the key production technologies of ethylene industry [1], so the operating conditions of the <b>cracking</b> <b>furnace</b> directly affect the yield and quality of ethylene [2, 3, 4].

Therefore, one of the most important activities of operating a <b>cracking</b> <b>furnace</b> is monitoring the temperature of furnace tubes by measuring and comparing the temperature of the tube surface with that of the gas outlet [6], referred to as the coil outlet temperature. At present, the most widely used tube surface temperature measurement method is to use a hand-held infrared thermometer for measuring, which locates and measures tube temperature via a hole in the <b>cracking</b> <b>furnace.</b> However, the method presents a number of drawbacks related to the limited observation range of the furnace, hostile temperature measurement environment, and awkward tube locations, which result in difficulties distinguishing between the temperature of the furnace tube surface and furnace wall, poor reproducibility of temperature measurement results, low efficiency, and high labor intensity.|$|R
