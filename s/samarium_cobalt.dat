Cobalt-based alloys are also corrosion and wear-resistant, making them (along with titanium) useful in medical orthopedic implants that do not wear down over time. The development of wear-resistant cobalt alloys started {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century with the stellite alloys, containing chromium with varying quantities of tungsten and carbon. Alloys with chromium and tungsten carbides are very hard and wear resistant. Special cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys like Vitallium are used for prosthetic parts (hip and knee replacements). Cobalt alloys are also used for dental prosthetics as a useful substitute for nickel, which may be allergenic. Some high speed steels also contain cobalt for increased heat and wear-resistance. The special alloys of aluminium, nickel, cobalt and iron, known as Alnico, and of <b>samarium</b> and <b>cobalt</b> (samarium-cobalt magnet) are used in permanent magnets.

The uniformly mixed metal composite powders, which had a controlled particle size and shape, were produced by the crystallization-stripping of two metal ions from the organic phase. The objective product was the metal composite powders of <b>samarium</b> and <b>cobalt</b> as a magnetism material. An extractant and a precipitant to be effective can be selected in crystallization-stripping by investigating the relation between a stripping condition of metal ions from the organic phase and the solubility of metal salts.

The crystallization-stripping reaction of Sm(III) and Co(II) from Versatic Acid 10 is fast, and Sm(III) and Co(II) in the organic phase are recovered more than 96 % as metal oxalates in 5 min reaction time. The recovery and particle shape of samarium-cobalt oxalates are affected by aqueous pH and agitation speed. With oxlaic acid solution at pH 2 ∼ 6, Sm(III) and Co(II) in the organic phase are completely recovered as metal oxalates.

In this study, the potential of greenhouse gases abatement via catalytic CO 2 (dry) reforming of methane to syngas over <b>samarium</b> oxide-supported <b>cobalt</b> (20 wt% Co/ 80 wt% Sm 2 O 3) catalyst was investigated. The 20 wt% Co/ 80 wt% Sm 2 O 3 material was synthesized via wet impregnation method and characterized using different instrument techniques. The methane dry reforming reaction, as well as its kinetics over the catalyst, was studied in a stainless steel fixed-bed continuous flow reactor at feed (CH 4 :CO 2) ratios range of 0. 1 – 1. 0, temperature range of 923 – 1023 K and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 30, 000 h− 1. The 20 wt% Co/ 80 wt% Sm 2 O 3 catalyst showed promising catalytic activity evident from the highest CH 4 and CO 2 conversion of ~ 71 and ~ 74 % as well as the highest hydrogen (H 2) and carbon monoxide (CO) yield of ~ 62 and ~ 73 %, respectively. Moreover, the methane dry reforming over the 20 wt% Co/ 80 wt% Sm 2 O 3 catalyst produces H 2 /CO ratio close to unity hence suitable for use as a chemical intermediate for synthesis of oxygenated fuels. The kinetic data obtained from the methane dry reforming were fitted to power law model. Apparent activation energies of 88. 62, 80. 12, 108. 12 and 100. 91 kJ mol− 1 were obtained for CH 4, CO 2, H 2 and CO, respectively.

40|$|The {{reforming}} {{of methane}} by carbon dioxide {{for the production}} of syngas is a potential technological route for the mitigation of greenhouse gases. However, the process is highly endothermic and often accompanied by catalyst deactivation from sintering and carbon deposition. Besides, the applications of dissimilar catalytic systems in methane dry reforming have made it difficult to obtain generalized optimum conditions for the desired products. Hence, optimization studies of any catalytic system often resulted in a unique optimum condition. The present study aimed to investigate optimum conditions of variables such as methane (CH 4) partial pressure, carbon dioxide (CO 2) partial pressure and reaction temperature that will maximize syngas yields from methane dry reforming over <b>samarium</b> oxide supported <b>cobalt</b> (Co/Sm 2 O 3) catalyst. The Co/Sm 2 O 3 catalyst was synthesized using wet-impregnation method and characterized by thermogravimetric analysis), field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction and nitrogen (N 2) physisorption. Syngas production by methane dry reforming over the synthesized Co/Sm 2 O 3 catalyst was investigated in a stainless steel fixed-bed reactor. The process variables (CH 4 partial pressure, CO 2 partial pressure and reaction temperature) for the syngas production were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). The RSM and artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to predict the syngas production from the experimental data. The comparative analysis between the two models showed that the ANN model has better prediction of the syngas yields compared to the RSM model as evident from the good agreement between the observed and the predicted values. At maximum desirability value of 0. 97, optimum CH 4 and CO 2 partial pressures of 47. 9 and 48. 9 kPa were obtained at reaction temperature of 735 °C resulting in syngas yield of ~ 79. 4 and 79. 0 % for hydrogen (H 2) and carbon monoxide (CO), respectively...|$|R

The residual neuroblastoma cells were assayed under the fluorescence microscopy, and the clonogenic capacity of the bone marrow progenitor cells were measured by culturing in the soft agar assay. A ratio of neuroblastoma cells to normal bone marrow cells was 1 : 10 and a ratio of magnetic immunobeads to neuroblastoma cells was 100 : 1. A tumor cells depletion rate of 1. 9 - 3. 8 logs was achieved using the cocktail antibodies with 5 E 9, 3 C 1, NCC-LU- 243 and NCC-LU- 246 and second cycle treatment. In a clinical cell separation unit 2. 81 log removal rate of tumor cells was obtained. Residual rate of human normal bone marrow cells after second cycle purging was 17. 1 %. Reduction in the clonogenic bone marrow progenitor cells was about 10 %. This purging method in use the procedure with the magnetic immunobeads and neuroblastoma cell antibodies seems to offer advantage with respect to speed and simplicity. By use of suitable antibodies, the immunomagnetic tumor cell depletion method is useful in autologous bone marrow transplantion of advanced neuroblastoma children with poor prognosis. Newly produced antibodies 5 E 9 and 3 C 1 are of great use in the immunomagnetic tumor cell depletion procedure...|$|R

5000|$|The {{neodymium}} atom {{also can}} have a large magnetic dipole moment because it has 7 unpaired electrons in its electron structure as opposed to (on average) 3 in iron. In a magnet it is the unpaired electrons, aligned so they spin in the same direction, which generate the magnetic field. This gives the Nd2Fe14B compound a high saturation magnetization (Js ~1.6 T or 16 kG) and typically 1.3 teslas. Therefore, as the maximum energy density is proportional to Js2, this magnetic phase {{has the potential for}} storing large amounts of magnetic energy (BHmax ~ 512 kJ/m3 or 64 MG·Oe).
