25|$|One famous {{name that}} appears in the photos is Charlie Kerr. Charlie was a great spinner and many <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had played in the ACA {{competition}} he would have played for Auckland and maybe New Zealand but Charlie was a loyal C man and later played for the Greenlane Cricket Club up until the mid Nineties which made him a very mature cricketer indeed.|$|E
500|$|Milan were {{expected}} to field a 4–4–2 formation, and there was much speculation about who would partner Andriy Shevchenko in attack. Filippo Inzaghi and Jon Dahl Tomasson were touted, but {{it was expected that}} on-loan striker Hernán Crespo would be chosen. This was echoed by Milan manager Ancelotti: [...] "I will not <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> will play from the start, but he will definitely play." [...] Liverpool were also expected to adopt a 4–4–2 formation. Dietmar Hamann was expected to start ahead of Igor Bišćan, and when questioned over whether Djibril Cissé or Milan Baroš would start as main striker, Benítez replied, [...] "Both are good enough, maybe both can play, why not?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} to rumors about Eddie being back in rehab Valerie Bertinelli said that [...] "he {{is not in}} rehab." [...] She did not, however, <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had recently been in rehab, stating only {{that he was not}} currently, a statement echoed by Wolfgang during the 2008 Kids Choice Awards. Eventually, the tour started back up on April 17 at the Reno Events Center in Nevada.|$|E
60|$|Francine {{suddenly}} {{showed an}} interest in what <b>he</b> was <b>saying.</b> <b>If</b> <b>he</b> had cared to observe her closely, he might have noticed it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} my father," [...] Chebron said suddenly, [...] "and abide by what <b>he</b> <b>says.</b> <b>If</b> <b>he</b> thinks it {{his duty to}} {{denounce}} me, so be it; in that case you will run no risk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, indeed,' said Sam. 'Ve thought ve should ha' been {{obliged to}} strait-veskit him last night; he's been a-ravin' all day; and <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> can't see you afore to-morrow night's over, he vishes {{he may be}} somethin' unpleasanted <b>if</b> <b>he</b> don't drownd hisself.' ...|$|R
2500|$|The five-hour {{hearing was}} a {{contentious}} one. Council member Tommy Wells, {{chair of the}} committee on public safety, called Ellerbe's answers about vehicle readiness [...] "vague", and the Washington Post reported that Ellerbe [...] "repeatedly faltered" [...] while answering. When pressed, Ellerbe could not even <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had visited the DCFEMS 9-1-1 emergency call center. Ellerbe turned for help from Deputy Mayor Paul Quander so often that Wells rebuked Ellerbe and demanded that Ellerbe (not Quander) respond. D.C. City Council chairman Phil Mendelson expressed shock that the city {{had to rely on}} reports from the firefighters' union and D.C. Inspector General's office for accurate information on the department, and rhetorically asked how Ellerbe cannot track 411 vehicles when the D.C. police can keep accurate track of 4,000 cars, trucks, and motorcycles. Ellerbe apologized to the council at the hearing for submitting inaccurate data on the fleet. But Wells warned Ellerbe that he should be prepared to quit unless he could guarantee the accuracy of the information the department provides. Despite the faulty vehicle data, Ellerbe said his capital request ($24 million for fiscal 2014, 2015, and 2016) did not need revision.|$|E
2500|$|Interviewed in 2015 by veteran Irish {{broadcaster}} Gay Byrne, Fry {{was asked}} what he would <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> came face-to-face with God. Fry said: [...] "Bone cancer in children, what’s that about? How dare you? How dare you create a world where there is such misery that’s not our fault? It’s utterly, utterly evil. [...] Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid God who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?" [...] Within days, the video was viewed over five million times. Fry later stated he did not refer to any specific religion, and said: [...] "I said quite {{a few things that}} were angry at this supposed God. I was merely saying things that Bertrand Russell and many finer heads of the mind have said for many thousands of years, going {{all the way back to}} the Greeks." [...] Because the God who created this universe, if it was created by God, is quite clearly a maniac, utter maniac.' In May 2017 it was announced that Fry, along with broadcaster RTÉ, were under criminal investigation for blasphemy under the 2009 Defamation Act, following a complaint from a member of the public about the broadcast: the case was dropped after the police confirmed that they had not been able to locate a sufficient number of offended people.|$|E
6000|$|There was pity, {{blended with}} malignity, in Mr. Cymon’s eye, as he replied, ‘Don’t matter, father! What would Captain Waters <b>say,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> heard such vulgarity?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{will write}} {{to my father}} this {{afternoon}} and hear what <b>he</b> <b>says.</b> <b>If</b> <b>he</b> thinks I cannot do any good and they don't want me at home, I shall be very pleased to come to you." ...|$|R
50|$|Upon hearing this, Chloe runs to {{the lily}} pond outside the Hillcrist home and drowns herself. When her body is discovered, the elder Hornblower concedes that Hillcrist has {{destroyed}} {{him and his family}} completely; <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> can, he will harm Hillcrist or one of Hillcrist's family. Hillcrist makes a sincere apology but Hornblower calls him a hypocrite.|$|R
50|$|Rava <b>says,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knows which day he {{departed}} on the journey, he may do work on {{the same}} day of the week 7 or 14 days after he departed, because he certainly would not have departed on a Sabbath.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear! my dear! {{you really}} {{ought not to}} talk so of your papa--it is very wrong, Margaret, indeed--what would Mr. Basil <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> heard you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, he {{was quite}} well," [...] said Katherine wearily. [...] "I didn't hear him <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{intended}} to come up or not. There, thanks--that will do nicely." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I dare <b>say!</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{has never}} cut, his {{ancestors}} have, and I {{suppose it is}} hereditary. Anyhow, I have been doing my best. Well, here goes!" ...|$|E
50|$|The duke appears and hires Bowman {{to smuggle}} a Hungarian {{scientist}} (Michael Bryan) out of France to the United States. Bowman is reluctant but the duke <b>says</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> won't do it he will report {{the car as}} being stolen.|$|R
6000|$|... "In <b>saying,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> ask, {{that it was}} {{south of}} the Christchurch road that I met you. I shall be shut up with the tire-women else, and have a week of spindle and bodkin, when I would fain be {{galloping}} Troubadour up Wilverley Walk, or loosing little Roland at the Vinney Ridge herons." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sure you have. Why, he's {{a millionaire}} several times over! Well, Perce comes back {{here for the}} black-bass fishing almost every summer, and <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could get away from business, he'd rather live here than in Boston or New York {{or any of those}} places. HE doesn't mind Chet's undertaking." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. John Blundell scowled; {{this was}} the third time the {{sergeant}} had said the thing {{that he would have}} liked to <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had thought of it.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Max Muller asks, {22} 'What would Mr. Andrew Lang <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{read the}} words of Signer Canizzaro, in his [...] "Genesi ed Evoluzione del Mito" [...] (1893), [...] "Lang has laid down his arms before his adversaries"?' Mr. Lang 'would smile.' And what would Mr. Max Muller <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{read the words}} of Professor Enrico Morselli, 'Lang gives no quarter to his adversaries, who, for the rest, have long been reduced to silence'? {23} The Right Hon. Professor also smiles, no doubt. We both smile. Solvuntur risu tabulae.|$|E
6000|$|SERGIUS (coming {{clear of}} the table and drawing her with him). I am {{surprised}} at myself, Louka. What would Sergius, the hero of Slivnitza, <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> saw me now? What would Sergius, the apostle of the higher love, <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> saw me now? What would the half dozen Sergiuses who keep popping in and out of this handsome figure of mine say if they caught us here? (Letting go her hand and slipping his arm dexterously round her waist.) Do you consider my figure handsome, Louka? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our's are {{all that}} he really cares for, and he will think of none of them, when he begins. No, Meta, you must not {{encourage}} him in it. Papa <b>says,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{did not think it}} half morbid--the result of the shock to his nerves--he should be angry with it as a sort of conceit!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, Sir Eric," [...] said Bernard, [...] "you {{hear what}} the boy <b>says.</b> <b>If</b> <b>he</b> speaks it out so bold and free, without bidding, and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> holds to what he says, I doubt it not that he shall not grieve for his journey to France, and that we shall see him, in all things, such a Prince as his father of blessed memory." ...|$|R
60|$|VENABLES. That is to <b>say,</b> Comtesse, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> proves {{himself the}} man I believe him to be.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What am I to <b>say?</b> <b>If</b> <b>he</b> {{have such}} hope {{he has not}} told me. I think it almost cruel that a girl should be asked in that way.' ...|$|E
60|$|Philip {{wondered}} what he would <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew how the report was treated. It arrived at breakfast, Mr. Carey glanced at it indifferently, and passed it over to Philip.|$|E
6000|$|... "I think I shall if I stay at The Horns much longer. What would papa <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{heard that}} I {{was going to}} give a lecture at an Institute?" ...|$|E
50|$|Caine {{offers to}} turn over the {{original}} copy of the formula (which he had got from Esau) in return for the release of his partner Yosuta. Steiffel agrees, and Yosuta is released. Just before leaving, Caine reveals that he sent the formula to Tauber. Before leaving, Caine <b>says</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could, he'd put a bullet in Steiffel's head.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, yes; drownded,' {{said the}} Captain, soothingly; 'as I was <b>saying,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{could be here}} he'd beg and pray of you, my precious, to pick a leetle bit, with a {{look-out}} for your own sweet health. Whereby, hold your own, my lady lass, {{as if it was}} for Wal'r's sake, and lay your pretty head to the wind.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> also <b>says</b> that, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{chose to}} write all he saw, his head would be broken in several places.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Quite {{enough for}} him, my dear, {{and a great}} deal too much I dare <b>say,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew it,' replied Squeers in a pacific tone. 'I only ask from curiosity, my dear.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{seems to}} be an awfully shrewd man," [...] he thought, meaning Parsons. [...] "I wonder what he would <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew I had taken the job merely as a blind?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{very nice}} young lady," [...] {{returned}} Andy, {{and then he}} went on, with a short laugh: [...] "I wonder what old Caleb Gulligan would <b>say</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew of our prosperity?" ...|$|E
50|$|He {{tells the}} gang {{that he has}} {{composed}} an even better symphony but cannot find an orchestra who will play it, so Boadicea <b>says</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> plays his squeeze box they will play whatever instruments they can make, he agrees and Bill makes a machine to play for them, however the machine sounds horrible, so they ask the musician <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wishes to come with them and they can find an orchestra together.|$|R
50|$|This revives Will, {{who then}} matches {{everything}} she demanded. Her mother refuses {{to let the}} daughter meet with him alone, but he wins a kiss from her. He asks the earl for leave to marry her, and the earl refuses, threatening to beat his daughter. Will <b>says</b> that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> beats her, {{he will have to}} fight all his men; John <b>says</b> that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had to refuse, he might have done so courteously.|$|R
50|$|After a {{few days}} on the job, Nick {{cultures}} a close friendship with Lucy. He begins {{to tell her about}} his reign and his choosing her as a successor. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> doesn't find a successor, a giant flood will engulf the world, adding that that was the reason for the Noah's Ark story. Lucy finds it ridiculous and tries to stay away from him.|$|R
