25|$|Although {{software}} (hyphenation algorithms) {{can often}} automatically {{make decisions on}} when to hyphenate a word at a line break, it is also sometimes useful for the user {{to be able to}} insert cues for those decisions (which are dynamic in the online medium, given that text can be reflowed). For this purpose, the concept of a <b>soft</b> <b>hyphen</b> (discretionary hyphen, optional hyphen) was introduced, allowing such manual specification of a place where a hyphenated break is allowed but not forced. That is, it does not force a line break in an inconvenient place when the text is later reflowed.|$|E
50|$|In HTML, {{there are}} two types of hyphens: the plain hyphen and the <b>soft</b> <b>hyphen.</b> The plain hyphen should be {{interpreted}} by a user agent as just another character. The <b>soft</b> <b>hyphen</b> tells the user agent where a line break can occur. Those browsers that interpret soft hyphens must observe the following semantics. If a line is broken at a <b>soft</b> <b>hyphen,</b> a hyphen character must be displayed at the end of the first line. If a line is not broken at a <b>soft</b> <b>hyphen,</b> the user agent must not display a hyphen character. For operations such as searching and sorting, the <b>soft</b> <b>hyphen</b> should always be ignored.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method is}} to use a <b>soft</b> <b>hyphen.</b> A <b>soft</b> <b>hyphen</b> is only used to {{indicate}} where a word can be split when breaking text lines and is not displayed. By placing this halfway in a word, the word gets broken up and will in some cases not be recognised by the wordfilter.|$|E
50|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>hyphens</b> {{have been}} used to obscure {{malicious}} domains or URLs in e-mail spam.|$|R
40|$|We present two {{applications}} {{of a word}} analysis system for the German language: pre-hyphenation of documents in various formats, and counting the syllables of all words of a document. The Si 3 Trenn preprocessor provides pre-hyphenation for file formats allowing for <b>soft</b> <b>hyphens</b> (currently: plain text, L T E X, RTF). It applies reliable, senseconveying hyphenation (SiSiSi) to each word of the input text and inserts <b>soft</b> <b>hyphens</b> directly into the text. The resulting document can be processed as usual; <b>soft</b> <b>hyphens</b> {{will be used for}} hyphenation at the end of lines if appropriate. The Si 3 Silb syllable counter is a helpful tool for the statistical analysis of texts, e. g. in readability studies...|$|R
25|$|In contrast, a hyphen that {{is always}} {{displayed}} and printed is called a hard hyphen (although some use this term {{to refer to a}} non-breaking hyphen; see below). <b>Soft</b> <b>hyphens</b> are inserted into the text at the positions where hyphenation may occur. It can be a tedious task to insert the <b>soft</b> <b>hyphens</b> by hand, and tools using hyphenation algorithms are available that do this automatically. Current modules of the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) standard provide language-specific hyphenation dictionaries.|$|R
50|$|Its {{semantics}} and HTML implementation {{are similar}} to the <b>soft</b> <b>hyphen.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the table}} above, 20 is the regular SPACE character, A0 is the NO-BREAK SPACE, and AD is <b>SOFT</b> <b>HYPHEN.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Soft</b> <b>hyphen</b> or nonbreaking hyphen (...) is {{a hidden}} {{separator}} for hyphenation {{in the places}} specified by the user, regardless of the automatic hyphenation.|$|E
50|$|An example {{application}} that outputs <b>soft</b> <b>hyphens</b> {{for this reason}} is the groff text formatter as used on many Unix/Linux systems to display man pages.|$|R
50|$|As an orthographic concept, the hyphen is {{a single}} entity. In terms of {{character}} encoding and display, that entity is represented by any of several characters and glyphs (including hard <b>hyphens,</b> <b>soft</b> or optional <b>hyphens,</b> and nonbreaking hyphens), {{depending on the context}} of use (discussed below).|$|R
50|$|Perfect Writer was {{initially}} a rebranded {{version of the}} MINCE and Scribble software packages from Mark of the Unicorn, which are CP/M implementation sof Emacs and Scribe, ported from their original minicomputer-based versions using BDS C. Later, MBasic (a variant of Microsoft Basic) and The Word Plus spellchecker {{were added to the}} model II suite of software. Word Plus included a set of utilities that could help solve crossword puzzles or anagrams, insert <b>soft</b> <b>hyphens,</b> alphabetize word lists, and compute word frequencies. Another utility program called Uniform allowed the Kaypro to read disks formatted by Osborne, Xerox, or TRS-80 computers.|$|R

5000|$|A word without hyphens {{can be made}} {{wrappable}} {{by having}} soft hyphens in it. When the word isn't wrapped (i.e., isn't broken across lines), the <b>soft</b> <b>hyphen</b> isn't visible. But if the word is wrapped across lines, this is done at the <b>soft</b> <b>hyphen,</b> at which point it is shown as a visible hyphen on the top line where the word is broken. (In the rare case of a word that {{is meant to be}} wrappable by breaking it across lines but without making a hyphen ever appear, a zero-width space is put at the permitted breaking point(s) in the word.) ...|$|E
50|$|Characters 00-3F and FF are controls, 40 is space, 41 is {{no-break}} space, and CA is <b>soft</b> <b>hyphen.</b> Characters {{are shown}} with their equivalent Unicode codes. Invariant alphanumeric, punctuation, and control characters {{are shown in}} color.|$|E
5000|$|All {{of these}} {{software}} tools {{are capable of}} flowing the content through algorithms to decide the pagination. For example, they all include automated word wrapping (to [...] hard-coded newline delimiters), machine-readable paragraphing (to make paragraph-ending decisions), and automated pagination (to make page-breaking decisions). All of those automated capabilities can be manually overridden by the human user, via <b>soft</b> <b>hyphens</b> (that is, inserting a hyphen which will only be used if the word is split over two lines, and thus not shown if not), manual line breaks (which force a new line within the same paragraph), hard returns (which force both a new line and a new paragraph), and manual page breaks.|$|R
25|$|It may be {{necessary}} to distinguish an incidental line-break hyphen from one integral to a word being mentioned (as when used in a dictionary) or present in an original text being quoted (when in a critical edition)—not only to control its word wrap behavior (which encoding handles with hard and <b>soft</b> <b>hyphens</b> having the same glyph) but also to differentiate appearance (with a different glyph). Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary and the Chambers Dictionary use a double hyphen for integral hyphens and a single hyphen for line-breaks, whereas Kromhout's Afrikaans–English dictionary uses the opposite convention. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (fifth edition) repeated an integral hyphen {{at the start of the}} following line.|$|R
5000|$|The MT/ST {{automated}} word wrap, {{but it had}} no screen, automated hyphenation (<b>soft</b> <b>hyphens</b> were available), or {{concept of}} the page; pages had to be divided and numbered by the human operator during playback. Instruction manuals taught the operator the importance of listening {{to the sounds of}} the machine during playback. The backspace key backed up the tape so a character could be recorded over; there was also a true backspace code, which allowed overstruck characters, like á. Insertion capabilities were limited: one could insert while copying from one tape station to the other; on a single tape one null character per line was reserved for insertions. A [...] "switch code" [...] instructed the playback to switch to the other tape drive. In a cumbersome way, points on the tape could be marked and jumped to.|$|R
50|$|At {{position}} 0xA0 there's {{always the}} non breaking space and 0xAD is mostly the <b>soft</b> <b>hyphen,</b> which only shows at line breaks. Other empty fields are either unassigned or the system used {{is not able}} to display them.|$|E

5|$|Abnormally {{developed}} milk caps infested by the parasitic sac fungus Hypomyces lateritius (syn. Peckialla laterita) are occasionally {{found in}} summer and autumn. The infested fruit bodies are usually more or less heavily malformed with a harder and more solid flesh than typical fruit bodies, {{so that they are}} more resistant to rot and can even survive the winter. They do not create gills; instead, the cap bottom is covered by an initially <b>soft,</b> white <b>hyphen</b> fungus, also known as a subiculum. Early on the mycelia becomes denser and takes on a white-grey colour. The perithecia are created after about 10–14 days. Perithecia are fruit bodies of the Hypomyces and other sac fungi, in which the spindle-shaped asci are produced. Besides L.deterrimus, L.deliciosus and L.sanguifluus can become infested, rarely other milk caps. Hypomyces lateritius, H.ochraceus, H.rosellus, H.odoratus, among other Hypomyces species live parasitically on different milk caps and brittlegills {{as well as on the}} fruit bodies of species from other genera.|$|R

5000|$|Several {{characters}} {{are designed to}} help control line-breaks either by discouraging them (no-break characters) or suggesting line breaks such as the <b>soft</b> <b>hyphen</b> (U+00AD) (sometimes called the [...] "shy hyphen"). Such characters, though designed for styling, are probably indispensable for the intricate types of line-breaking they make possible.|$|E
50|$|In the {{following}} table characters are shown together with their corresponding Unicode code points. Note that code values 00-1F, 7F, and 80-9F are not assigned to characters by ISO/IEC 8859-2. Code 20 is the regular SPACE character, and A0 is the NON-BREAKING SPACE. Code AD is a <b>SOFT</b> <b>HYPHEN,</b> which even in isolation may not appear at all in compliant web browsers.|$|E
50|$|The use of SHY {{characters}} in text {{that will be}} broken into lines by the recipient is the application context considered by the post-1999 HTML and Unicode specifications, {{as well as some}} word-processing file formats. In this context, the <b>soft</b> <b>hyphen</b> may also be called a discretionary hyphen or optional hyphen. It serves as an invisible marker used to specify a place in text where a hyphenated break is allowed without forcing a line break in an inconvenient place if the text is re-flowed. It becomes visible only after word wrapping {{at the end of a}} line. The soft hyphen's Unicode semantics and HTML implementation are in many ways similar to Unicode's zero-width space, with the exception that the <b>soft</b> <b>hyphen</b> will preserve the kerning of the characters on either side when not visible. The zero-width space, on the other hand, will not, as it is considered a visible character even if not rendered, thus having its own kerning metrics.|$|E
50|$|In {{computing}} and typesetting, a <b>soft</b> <b>hyphen</b> (ISO 8859: 0xAD, Unicode , HTML: &#173; &shy;) or {{syllable hyphen}} (EBCDIC: 0xCA), abbreviated SHY, is a code point reserved in some coded character sets {{for the purpose}} of breaking words across lines by inserting visible hyphens. Two alternative ways of using the soft-hyphen character for this purpose have emerged, depending on whether the encoded text will be broken into lines by its recipient, or has already been preformatted by its originator.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is used as}} a {{distinct}} punctuation mark in Ojibwe language publications in the Fiero Roman orthography, as a hyphen is used to separate compound preverb units regardless of their line position, while a double hyphen is used to divide a word {{at the end of a}} line and can be treated as a <b>soft</b> <b>hyphen.</b> However, due to lack of availability of a double hyphen in most fonts, an equal sign is often used as a substitute.|$|E
50|$|Although {{software}} (hyphenation algorithms) {{can often}} automatically {{make decisions on}} when to hyphenate a word at a line break, it is also sometimes useful for the user {{to be able to}} insert cues for those decisions (which are dynamic in the online medium, given that text can be reflowed).

50|$|Here, SHY is {{a visible}} hyphen {{that is usually}} {{visually}} indistinguishable from a regular hyphen, but has been inserted solely {{for the purpose of}} line breaking. The purpose of the <b>soft</b> <b>hyphen</b> here is to distinguish it from any regular hyphen that might {{have been part of the}} original spelling of the word. This distinction helps to reuse already formatted text, when line breaks and soft hyphens inserted during word wrapping have to be removed to convert the text back into its unformatted form. For example, the copy or paste function of a terminal emulator can offer to replace line breaks with a space character, and remove any soft hyphens including any immediately following whitespace characters.|$|E
5000|$|The table {{below is}} based on CCSID 037, one of the code page {{variants}} of EBCDIC; it shows only the basic (English) EBCDIC characters. Characters 00-3F and FF are controls, 40 is space, 41 is no-break space (RSP: [...] "Required Space"), E1 is numeric space (NSP: [...] "Numeric Space"), and CA is <b>soft</b> <b>hyphen.</b> Characters are shown with their equivalent Unicode codes. Unassigned codes are typically filled with international or region-specific characters in the various EBCDIC code page variants, but the punctuation marks and other special characters, such as cent sign, are often moved around as well; only the letters and numbers and space have the same assignments in all EBCDIC code pages.|$|E
40|$|The recent clarication of the {{semantics}} of <b>SOFT</b> <b>HYPHEN</b> (U+ 00 AD) in Unicode 4. 0 [1, 2] did not undergo {{any public}} review [3] and appears problematic {{with regard to}} existing implementation practice. Changing its general category from " (punctuation, dash) to " (other, format) along with clarifying {{that it has no}} rendering breaks backwards compatibility with how this character has been widely used in ISO 8859 - 1 terminals for the past 15 years. The change now causes headaches for the designers of VT 100 -style terminal emulators with ISO 8859 - 1 and UTF- 8 support. Modern text processing systems make a clear distinction between an unformatted content data stream (e. g., a Word, TeX or HTML le) and a formatted presentation datastream (e. g., a PDF, PostScript, or PCL le). This distinction is today given for granted by people who grew up with Word and similar content-data-stream editors. Unicode with its character/glyph model is clearly targeted primarily for use in content data streams, which still have to undergo line breaking before display. However, ISO 8859 - 1 was written in about 1984, when internationalization was all about adding diacritical characters for European countries, which preserved the one-to-one character/glyph mapping of tradi...|$|E
