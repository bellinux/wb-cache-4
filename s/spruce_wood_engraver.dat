50|$|In 1905 Rooke {{became a}} teacher of book {{illustration}} at the Central School, and introduced <b>wood</b> <b>engraving</b> for book decoration into his syllabus. He faced opposition from Frank Morley Fletcher and Sydney Lee who taught classes in colour woodcuts in the Japanese style. Lethaby had had to overcome opposition to Johnston's calligraphy classes, and, along with most artists at the time, saw <b>wood</b> <b>engraving</b> simply as the reproductive medium {{that it had been}} until then. He vetoed the introduction of the new style of <b>wood</b> <b>engraving</b> into the curriculum.

40|$|<b>Wood</b> <b>engraving</b> is {{the oldest}} {{graphical}} technique. The Chinese are considered its authors because they already used woodcut to duplicate writing (ideograms) in the VI century. <b>Wood</b> <b>engraving</b> reached Europe via Japan only in the XVI century. Presumably, this method was used to publish Varro’s “Imagines” in Rome in the I century BC. <b>Wood</b> <b>engraving,</b> improved for centuries, found many adherents and developed into many varieties. The colored description of the journey to the Holy Land by Bernard von Brydenbach from 1486, is the first book where {{the name of the}} artist, the <b>wood</b> <b>engraver,</b> Erhard Renwich is mentioned. A seal ring of Kasper Hochfeder is regarded as the oldest Polish <b>wood</b> <b>engraving.</b> Kasper Hochfeder came from Metz to Poland at instignation of Jan Haller, and he founded a printing house in Cracow in 1503. Thomas Bewick, an English engraver who lived between the XVIII and XIX century, did a lot to modernize a method of <b>wood</b> <b>engraving.</b> Polish artists: Wincenty Smokowski, Józef Holewiński, Jan Styfi, Feliks Jasiński also contributed to the development of <b>wood</b> <b>engraving</b> as an independent artistic technique, which was used to decorate books as well. But the most distinguished in this field was Władysław Skoczylas and his students from the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw: Tadeusz Cieślewski junior; Tadeusz Kulisiewicz, Stanisław Ostoja–Chostowski, Edmund Bartłomiejczyk and others...|$|R
