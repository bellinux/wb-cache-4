5|$|Arabian horses also <b>spread</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rest of {{the world}} via the Ottoman Empire, which rose in 1299. Though it never fully {{dominated}} the heart of the Arabian Peninsula, this Turkish empire obtained many Arabian horses through trade, diplomacy and war. The Ottomans encouraged formation of private stud farms in order to ensure a supply of cavalry horses, and Ottoman nobles, such as Muhammad Ali of Egypt also collected pure, desert-bred Arabian horses.|$|E
5|$|At Parken Stadium, {{where the}} final {{was to be}} played, the police erected iron fencing outside to {{separate}} the Arsenal and Galatasaray fans as a precaution.

5|$|Differences in songs, {{genetics}} and morphology {{suggests that the}} Azores were colonised in a single invasion in the late Pleistocene, about 100,000 years ago.

5|$|Firefighters {{were able}} to save over 100 {{people out of the}} 180 {{families}} inhabiting the high-rise apartment building. According to Al Jazeera, the fire began at the scaffolding that surrounded the building, but <b>spread</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> complex's main building of around 500 apartments. Xinhua News Agency said the fire was contained at about 6:30pm local time (10:30 UTC), more than four hours after it began.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 29 March 1947, coordinated {{surprise}} attacks were launched by Malagasy nationalists, armed mainly with spears, against military bases and French-owned plantations {{in the eastern part}} of the island concentrated around Moramanga and Manakara.

While the great king himself took to flight with his baggage train northwards, the entire line of his army gave way. The casualties reported for Tigranes' army are immense, with estimates given from 10,000 to as many as 100,000 men.|$|E
5|$|The lung is {{a common}} place for the spread of tumors {{from other parts of}} the body. Secondary cancers are {{classified}} by the site of origin; e.g., breast cancer that has <b>spread</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lung is called metastatic breast cancer. Metastases often have a characteristic round appearance on chest radiograph.|$|E
5|$|The {{spread of}} {{pancreatic}} cancer to other organs (metastasis) may also cause symptoms.

5|$|After being underfed {{and forced}} into long, grueling marches through rough terrain {{for nearly two}} months, the Batetela in Dhanis' column mutinied against their {{officers}} in February 1897. The mutiny {{broke out in the}} advance guard, which had been pushed the hardest of those in the expedition, but soon <b>spread</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main army, where the massively outnumbered Belgian officers were detained by their men and killed. Dhanis himself escaped the massacre by hiding in the forest, although his brother did not manage to survive. The now disbanded army went on to rampage throughout the immediate area, terrorizing the northern Congo and causing great consternation among the Belgian officials whose jobs it was to keep the peace.|$|E
5|$|An attack often {{begins with}} muscle pain, cramping, and stiffness. This is {{followed}} by weakness or paralysis that tends to develop rapidly, usually in late evening or {{the early hours of}} the morning. The weakness is usually symmetrical; the limb muscles closer to the trunk (proximal) are predominantly affected, and weakness tends to start in the legs and <b>spread</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> arms. Muscles of the mouth and throat, eyes, and breathing are usually not affected, but occasionally weakness of the respiratory muscles can cause life-threatening respiratory failure. Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days, even in the absence of treatment. On neurological examination during an attack, flaccid weakness of the limbs is noted; reflexes are usually diminished, but the sensory system is unaffected. Mental status is not affected.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the harsh}} winter conditions, the station area was {{gradually}} built with snow tunnels {{to keep the}} snow off the tracks. This included the platforms {{and most of the}} passing loop at the station. In 1914–15, the station serviced 398 passengers, and in 1919–20, it serviced 684 passengers, both times making it the least used station on the line. In 1948, {{the western part of the}} snow tunnel caught fire, and although it <b>spread</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> station building, it was quickly put out by the staff. In 1953, there was again a fire in the tunnel.|$|E

Generally this occurs unilaterally, but the spine can be infected by spreading of skull-base osteomyelitis <b>to</b> <b>the</b> opposite side. This is a serious disease with high mortality and multiple cranial paralysis rates [6].|$|R

5|$|Defence was sunk on 31 May 1916 {{during the}} Battle of Jutland, the largest naval {{battle of the}} war. Escorting {{the main body of}} the Grand Fleet, the ship was fired upon by one German battlecruiser and four dreadnoughts as she {{attempted}} to engage a disabled German light cruiser. She was struck by two salvoes from the German ships that detonated her rear magazine.

5|$|Elizabeth {{was held}} in the YMCA for nearly 200days, during which time the Kempeitai meticulously {{followed}} up every point in her story, cross-examining people she said she had helped. After a huge dossier of interviews had been compiled, the Japanese concluded that she was telling the truth and set her free. Khun Heng, however, was sentenced to 12years in Outram Road Prison. People avoided Elizabeth following her release, too terrified to speak to her. Fifteen internees died in the Kempeitais cells during the Double Tenth inquisition. The suffering <b>spread</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entire civilian population of Changi Prison; rations were cut, and games, concerts, plays, and school lessons were forbidden for months.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the fall}} of Constantinople (1453), the newly {{expanded}} Ottoman Empire welcomed European embassies in its capital, which in turn became the sources of plants from those regions to the east which traded with the empire. In the following century twenty times as many plants entered Europe along the Silk Road as had been transported in the previous two thousand years, mainly as bulbs. Others were acquired primarily for their alleged medicinal value. Initially Italy benefited from this new knowledge, especially Venice, which traded extensively with the East. From there these new plants rapidly <b>spread</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rest of Western Europe.|$|E

5|$|Gills are adnate with a decurrent tooth (where {{the gills}} curve up {{to join the}} stipe but then, close to the stipe, the margin turns down again), and {{initially}} narrow but broaden when old. They are pallid to grayish-olive with bright orange edges. Smith noted that the edge color may <b>spread</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gill faces in some specimens, because the pigment, rather than being encrusted {{on the walls of}} the cystidia, is found in the cytosol and therefore more readily diffusible. The gills are spaced close together, with between 16 and 26 gills reaching the stipe, and there are up to three tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stipe).|$|E
5|$|If {{investigations}} confirm NSCLC, {{the stage}} is assessed {{to determine whether the}} disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has <b>spread</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point where it cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and positron emission tomography are used for this determination. If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, the nodes may be sampled to assist staging. Techniques used for this include transthoracic needle aspiration, transbronchial needle aspiration (with or without endobronchial ultrasound), endoscopic ultrasound with needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Blood tests and pulmonary function testing are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery. If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be possible.|$|E
5|$|In 1862 Troy {{suffered}} {{another major}} fire, {{the worst in}} its history. A locomotive's spark ignited the wooden Green Island drawbridge that existed at the time, and when {{that could not be}} contained to the bridge it <b>spread</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east, ultimately devastating 507 buildings over a 16-block area. As before, the city rebuilt quickly, with the area along Fifth between Broadway and Grant Street, where Cummings built a row of houses between Fifth and Sixth, most strongly reflecting this era of rapid construction and reconstruction. The Gurley Building, too, rose in just eight months from the ashes of its predecessor. The nearby neighborhood also became desirable, with many local businessmen moving into newly built homes along Fifth.|$|E
