40|$|The <b>spreading</b> <b>and</b> {{permeation}} of droplets on porous substrates is {{a fundamental}} process {{in a variety of}} applications, such as coating, dyeing, <b>and</b> printing. The <b>spreading</b> <b>and</b> permeating usually occur synchronously but play different roles in the practical applications. The mechanisms of the competition between <b>spreading</b> <b>and</b> permeation is significant but still unclear. A lattice Boltzmann method is used to study the <b>spreading</b> <b>and</b> permeation of droplets on hybrid-wettability porous substrates, with different wettability on the surface and the inside pores. The competition between the <b>spreading</b> <b>and</b> the permeation processes is studied in this work from the effects of the substrate and the fluid properties, including the substrate wettability, the porous parameters, as well as the fluid surface tension and viscosity. The results show that increasing the surfacewettability and the porosity contact angle both inhibit the <b>spreading</b> <b>and</b> the permeation processes. When the inside porosity contact angle is larger than 90 ° (hydrophobic), the permeation process does not occur. The droplets suspend on substrates with Cassie state. The droplets are more easily to permeate into substrates with a small inside porosity contact angle (hydrophilic), as well as large pore sizes. Otherwise, the droplets are more easily to spread on substrate surfaces with small surface contact angle (hydrophilic) and smaller pore sizes. The competition between droplet <b>spreading</b> <b>and</b> permeation is also related to the fluid properties. The permeation process is enhanced by increasing of surface tension, leading to a smaller droplet lifetime. The goals of this study are to provide methods to manipulate the <b>spreading</b> <b>and</b> permeation separately, which are of practical interest in many industrial applications...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{interest rate}} <b>spreads</b> <b>and</b> margins in banking in Bangladesh {{for the period}} 1990 - 2008. The application of the Arellano-Bover/Blundell-Bond dynamic panel regression model to a panel of 43 banks for the period 1990 - 2008 reveals persistency in interest <b>spreads</b> <b>and</b> margins. The model also identifies that high administrative costs, high non-performing loan ratio and some macroeconomic factors are the key determinants of persistently high interest rate <b>spreads</b> <b>and</b> margins. Persistently high <b>spreads</b> <b>and</b> margins in old private banks (established before 1999) are attributed {{to a certain degree}} of market power in the post-liberalization period (after 1999). These factors together imply a lack of competition and efficiency in the banking sector of Bangladesh despite financial reforms. ...|$|R

5|$|HIV is {{now known}} to spread between CD4+ T cells by two {{parallel}} routes: cell-free <b>spread</b> <b>and</b> cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms. In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread. The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between sovereign <b>spreads</b> <b>and</b> the interaction between debt composition and debt levels in advanced and emerging market countries. It finds that in emerging market countries {{there is a significant}} correlation between <b>spreads</b> <b>and</b> debt levels. This correlation, however, is not statistically significant in countries where most public debt is denominated in local currency. In advanced economies, the magnitude of the correlation between debt levels <b>and</b> <b>spreads</b> is about one fifth of the corresponding correlation for emerging market economies. In Eurozone countries, however, the correlation between <b>spreads</b> <b>and</b> debt ratios {{is similar to that of}} emerging market countries. The paper also shows that the financial crisis amplified {{the relationship between}} <b>spreads</b> <b>and</b> debt levels within the Eurozone but had no effect on the relationship between <b>spreads</b> <b>and</b> debt in standalone countries. Finally, the paper shows that the relationship between debt levels <b>and</b> <b>spreads</b> is amplified by the presence of large net foreign liabilities. This amplifying effect of net foreign liabilities is larger in the Eurozone than in standalone advanced economies. The paper concludes that debt composition matters and corroborates the original sin hypothesis that, rather than being a mere reflection of institutional weaknesses, the presence of foreign currency debt increases financial fragility and leads to suboptimal macroeconomic policies...|$|R
