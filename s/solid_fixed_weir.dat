40|$|Movable weirs {{have been}} {{developed}} to address the weaknesses of conventional <b>fixed</b> <b>weirs.</b> However, the structures for riverbed protection downstream of movable weirs are designed using the criteria of <b>fixed</b> <b>weirs</b> in most cases, and these applications cause problems, such as scour and deformation of structures, due to misunderstanding the difference between different types of structures. In this study, a hydraulic experiment was conducted to examine weir type-specific hydraulic phenomena, compare hydraulic jumps and downstream flow characteristics according to different weir types, and analyze hydraulic characteristics, such as changes in water levels, velocities and energy. Additionally, to control the flow generated by a sluice gate, energy dissipators were examined herein for their effectiveness in relation to different installation locations and heights. As a result, it was found that although sluice gates generated hydraulic jumps similar to those of <b>fixed</b> <b>weirs,</b> their downstream supercritical flow increased to eventually elongate the overall hydraulic jumps. In energy dissipator installation, installation heights were found to be sensitive to energy dissipation. The most effective energy dissipator height was 10 % of the downstream free surface water depth in this experiment. Based on these findings, it seems desirable to use energy dissipators to reduce energy, as such dissipators were found to be effective in reducing hydraulic jumps and protecting the riverbed under sluice gates...|$|R

40|$|Dams are {{critical}} infrastructures whose failure would entail serious consequences for community safety. Although large dams represent {{the most dangerous}} items, small size dams may be critical, as {{a large number of}} these constructions are built in the proximity to inhabited zones. Earthquake is one of the hazards that may affect an existing dam. To assess safety and plan investments, dam owners need to create prioritisation sequences of interventions through a protocol considering technical, political and societal aspects. It is presented herein a specific procedure, based on a multi-criteria analysis with a rapid screening survey of the infrastructures, which addresses to classify the seismic criticality of dams considering the effects (in terms of loss of life and property) of a failure scenario subsequent to an earthquake. A protocol is used to define a prioritisation of interventions that mitigate the seismic risk. It has been applied to a group of 9 small concrete dams and 17 <b>fixed</b> <b>weirs,</b> built from 1920 to 1990 in Aosta Valley (Italy).

25|$|A {{spillway}} is {{a section}} of a dam designed to pass water from the upstream side of a dam to the downstream side. Many spillways have floodgates designed to control the flow through the spillway. There are several types of spillway. A service spillway or primary spillway passes normal flow. An auxiliary spillway releases flow {{in excess of the}} capacity of the service spillway. An emergency spillway is designed for extreme conditions, such as a serious malfunction of the service spillway. A fuse plug spillway is a low embankment designed to be overtopped and washed away {{in the event of a}} large flood. The elements of a fuse plug are independent free-standing blocks, set side by side which work without any remote control. They allow increasing the normal pool of the dam without compromising the security of the dam because they are designed to be gradually evacuated for exceptional events. They work as <b>fixed</b> <b>weirs</b> at times by allowing over-flow for common floods.|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} {{hydraulic model}} {{was developed by}} improving the numerical implementation of internal boundary condition and the pre-diction of scour depth to analyse hydraulic effects in operation of multi-function weir during the flooding season. The proposed model calculates overflow at <b>fixed</b> <b>weir</b> and gate discharge controlled by movable weir depending on the computed water stages on the upstream and downstream reach compared to conventional model applying internal boundary condition specified as prescribed stage or rating curve. In addition, it can predict time-dependent scour depth considering soil properties under unsteady state in order to investigate the hydraulic effects on bridge structure located downstream. A historical flood event was applied to demonstrate the ver-ification of the model as simulation results were compared with observations on monitoring station. It was shown that the prediction of water stages, gate discharges, and scour depth enable gate operation rule to minimize the effect of flood stage rising by movabl...|$|R

40|$|Modelling {{floodplains}} adequately {{is crucial}} for numerous water management applications. Many of these require {{a large number of}} simulations or long term calculations, thereby necessitating the use of models with a limited calculation time. This paper investigates two different flexible data-driven methods for computationally efficient lumped floodplain modelling that predict the inundation level in the floodplain and the flow between the river and the floodplain for a given set of river stages. The flow can be calculated using a set of optimized discharge equations. Alternatively, a hybrid approach can be followed that combines physical principles with neural networks that rely on water levels to obtain flow estimates. The derived methodology was tested on a case study using simulation results from a detailed MIKE 11 model that solves the full de Saint-Venant equations. The results show that both approaches deliver accurate results, although the neural networks outperform the <b>fixed</b> <b>weir</b> equations. At the same time, the simulations are more than 10. 000 faster compared to the original full hydrodynamic model. The obtained floodplain models can be used for various applications that require very short computation times. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Construction of {{the canal}} was overseen by {{architect}} John Nash, with James Morgan acting as supervising engineer. Hampstead Road Locks were built between 1818 and 1820, with the chambers made of brick and stone coping along the top. The two locks are arranged side by side, with an island platform between them. Each chamber has two gates at both ends, {{and they have been}} Grade II listed since 1992. They were the first of 12 pairs of similar locks which dropped the level {{of the canal}} by 96 ft to reach Limehouse Basin. The transfer of water between the chambers made operation of the locks more complex, and so they were permanently manned during the heyday of the canal, with lock-keepers working a shift system to provide 24-hour cover. As the use of the canal declined, in part due to railway competition, manning levels were reduced, and padlocks were used to prevent operation of the locks at the weekends. Following the end of commercial traffic and the growth of leisure boating, the locks reverted to operation by boat crews, and in order to prevent flooding caused by incorrect operation of the paddles, in the 1980s most of the pairs were converted to single locks, by replacing the lower gates of one chamber with a <b>fixed</b> <b>weir.</b> Hampstead Road Lock is the only one where both chambers have been retained, although they are now emptied conventionally.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to understand the effects of breach properties (e. g. the top width, the depth and the bottom width of the breach) on the breach flow. The breach flow was modeled as flow over a compound broad-crested weir. A laboratory experiment was carried out with a <b>fixed</b> <b>weir</b> model in a flume. Five cases with different breach properties were tested. Firstly, the discharge coefficients for all cases were quantitatively determined. The calibrations were done under two flow conditions, namely emerged flow conditions (flow only through the breach) and overtopping flow conditions (flow through the compound cross-section of weir). In perfect weir situations, {{it turned out that the}} values of the discharge coefficient were below 1 and rather different in the two flow conditions. Particularly in the case of overtopping flow, the linear combination of traditional discharge equations was verified for predicting the discharge and the discharge distribution over the weir. In imperfect weir situations, submergence coefficient was introduced in emerged condition. Secondly, the dependence of the energy head loss caused by the weir on the upstream discharge and the downstream water depth was discussed in imperfect weir situations. The Form Drag model for estimating the energy head loss was proved to be applicable for the modeled breach flow. Thirdly, the local hydraulic characteristics of breach flow were described by means of velocity distribution, water level elevation and flow patterns appearing behind the weir. At last, the numerical model (Delft 3 D) was verified on the modeling of the present experiment by comparing with the experimental data. The report provides the information for the breach flow which can be of use in the development of breach models, inundation models and compound weir design.
