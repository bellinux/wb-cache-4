40|$|International audienceMicrosatellites (SSRs) {{are highly}} {{susceptible}} to expansions and contractions. When {{located in a}} coding sequence, the insertion or the deletion of a single unit for a mono-, di-, tetra-, or penta(nucleotide) -SSR creates a frameshift. As a consequence, {{one would expect to}} find only very few of these <b>SSRs</b> in <b>coding</b> sequences because of their strong deleterious potential. Unexpectedly, genomes contain many <b>coding</b> <b>SSRs</b> of all types. Here, we report on a study of their evolution in a phylogenetic context using the genomes of four primates: human, chimpanzee, orangutan, and macaque. In a set of 5, 015 orthologous genes unambiguously aligned among the four species, we show that, except for tri- and hexa-SSRs, for which insertions and deletions are frequently observed, <b>SSRs</b> in <b>coding</b> regions evolve mainly by substitutions. We show that the rate of substitution in all types of <b>coding</b> <b>SSRs</b> is typically two times higher than in the rest of coding sequences. Additionally, we observe that although numerous <b>coding</b> <b>SSRs</b> are created and lost by substitutions in the lineages, their numbers remain constant. This last observation suggests that the <b>coding</b> <b>SSRs</b> have reached equilibrium. We hypothesize that this equilibrium involves a combination of mutation, drift, and selection. We thus estimated the fitness cost of mono-SSRs and show that it increases with the number of units. We finally show that the cost of coding mono-SSRs greatly varies from function to function, suggesting that the strength of the selection that acts against them can be correlated to gene functions...|$|R

40|$|Simple {{sequence}} repeats (SSRs) are indel mutation-al hotspots in genomes. In prokaryotes, SSR loci {{can cause}} phase variation, a microbial survival strategy {{that relies on}} stochastic, reversible on–off switching of gene activity. By analyzing multiple strains of 42 fully sequenced prokaryotic species, we measure the relative variability and density dis-tribution of <b>SSRs</b> in <b>coding</b> regions. We demonstrate that repeat type strongly influences indel mutation rates, and that the most mutable types are most strongly avoided across genomes. We thoroughly characterize SSR density and variability {{as a function of}} N!C position along protein sequences. Using codon-shuffling algorithms that preserve amino acid sequence, we assess evolutionary pres-sures on SSRs. We find that coding sequences suppress repeats in the middle of proteins, and enrich repeats near termini, yielding U-shaped SSR density curves. We show that for many species this characteristic shape can be attributed to purely biophysical constraints of protein structure. In multiple cases, however, particularly in certain pathogenic bacteria, we observe over enrichment of SSRs near protein N-termini significantly beyond expectation based on structural constraints. This increases the probability that frameshifts result in non-functional proteins, revealing that these species may evolutionarily tune <b>SSR</b> positions in <b>coding</b> regions to facilitate phase variation...|$|R
40|$|Simple {{sequence}} repeats (SSRs) {{are present}} abundantly in most eukaryotic genomes. They affect several cellular processes like chromatin organization, regulation of gene activity, DNA repair, DNA recombination, etc. Though considerable data exists on using nuclear SSRs to infer phylogenetic relationships, {{the potential of}} chloroplast microsatellites (cpSSR), in this regard, remains largely unexplored. In the present study we probe various nucleotide repeat motifs (NRMs) / types of SSRs present in chloroplast genomes (cpDNA) of 12 species belonging to Brassicaceae family. NRMs show a non-random distribution in coding and non-coding compartments of cpDNA. As expected, trinucleotide repeats are more common in coding regions while other repeat motifs are prominent in non-coding DNA. Total numbers of <b>SSRs</b> in <b>coding</b> region show little variation between species while considerable variation is exhibited by SSRs in non-coding regions. Finally, we have designed universal primers that yield polymorphic amplicons from all 12 species.

All {{organisms that}} have been studied until now {{have been found to}} have {{differential}} distribution of simple sequence repeats (SSRs), with more SSRs in intergenic than in <b>coding</b> sequences. <b>SSR</b> distribution was investigated in Archaea genomes where complete chromosome sequences of 19 Archaea were analyzed with the program SPUTNIK to find di- to penta-nucleotide repeats. The number of repeats was determined for the complete chromosome sequences and for the coding and non-coding sequences. Different from what has been found for other groups of organisms, there is an abundance of <b>SSRs</b> in <b>coding</b> regions of the genome of some Archaea. Dinucleotide repeats were rare and CG repeats were found in only two Archaea. In general, trinucleotide repeats are the most abundant SSR motifs; however, pentanucleotide repeats are abundant in some Archaea. Some of the tetranucleotide and pentanucleotide repeat motifs are organism specific. In general, repeats are short and CG-rich repeats are present in Archaea having a CG-rich genome.

Herein we describe an S. aureus regulatory RNA, SSR 42, which modulates the expression of approximately 80 mRNA species, including several virulence factors, in S. aureus strains UAMS- 1 and USA 300 (LAC) during sta-tionary-phase growth. Mutagenesis studies revealed that <b>SSR</b> 42 <b>codes</b> for an 891 -nucleotide RNA molecule and that the mole-cule’s regulatory effects are mediated by the full-length transcript.

Further, in S. aureus strain LAC, SSR 42 is required for wild-type levels of erythrocyte lysis, resistance to human polymorphonuclear leukocyte killing, and pathogenesis in a murine model of skin and soft tissue infection.

40|$|Microsatellites {{or simple}} {{sequence}} repeats (SSR) are abundant, highly diverse stretches of short DNA repeats {{present in all}} genomes. Tandem mono/tri/hexanucleotide repeats in the coding regions contribute to single amino acids repeats (SAARs) in the proteome. While <b>SSRs</b> in the <b>coding</b> region always result in amino acid repeats, a majority of SAARs arise due {{to a combination of}} various codons representing the same amino acid and not as a consequence of SSR events. Certain amino acids are abundant in repeat regions indicating a positive selection pressure behind the accumulation of SAARs. By analysing 22 proteomes including the human proteome, we explored the functional and structural relationship of amino acid repeats in an evolutionary context. Only ~ 15 % of repeats are present in any known functional domain, while ~ 74 % of repeats are present in the disordered regions, suggesting that SAARs add to the functionality of proteins by providing flexibility, stability and act as linker elements between domains. Comparison of SAAR containing proteins across species reveals that while shorter repeats are conserved among orthologs, proteins with longer repeats, > 15 amino acids, are unique to the respective organism. Lysine repeats are well conserved among orthologs with respect to their length and number of occurrences in a protein. Other amino acids such as glutamic acid, proline, serine and alanine repeats are generally conserved among the orthologs with varying repeat lengths. These findings suggest that SAARs have accumulated in the proteome under positive selection pressure and that they provide flexibility for optimal folding of functional/structural domains of proteins. The insights gained from our observations can help in effective designing and engineering of proteins with novel features...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND : Microsatellites {{or simple}} {{sequence}} repeats (SSRs) are DNA sequences consisting of 1 – 6 bp tandem repeat motifs {{present in the}} genome. SSRs {{are considered to be}} one of the most powerful tools in genetic studies. We carried out a comparative study of perfect SSR loci belonging to class I (≥ 20) and class II (≥ 12 and < 20 bp) types located in coding regions of high confidence genes in Picea abies and Pinus taeda. SSRLocator was used to retrieve SSRs from the full length CDS of predicted genes in both species. RESULTS : Trimers were the most abundant motifs in class I followed by hexamers in Picea abies, while trimers and hexamers were equally abundant in Pinus taeda class I SSRs. Hexamers were most frequent within class II SSRs followed by trimers, in both species. Although the frequency of genes containing SSRs was slightly higher in Pinus taeda, SSR counts per Mbp for class I was similar in both species (P-value = 0. 22); while for class II SSRs, it was significantly higher in Picea abies (P-value = 0. 00009). AT-rich motifs were higher in abundance than the GC-rich motifs, within class II SSRs in both the species (P-values = 10 − 9 and 0). With reference to class I SSRs, AT-rich and GC-rich motifs were detected with equal frequency in Pinus taeda (P-value = 0. 24); while in Picea abies, GC-rich motifs were detected with higher frequency than the AT-rich motifs (P-value = 0. 0005). CONCLUSIONS : Our study gives a comparative overview of the genome SSRs composition based on high confidence genes in the two recently sequenced and economically important conifers and, also provides information on functional molecular markers that can be applied in genetic studies in Pinus and Picea species.

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} two {{bioinformatics}} research topics: {{the development of}} tools for an efficient and reliable identification of single nucleotides polymorphisms (SNPs) and polymorphic simple sequence repeats (SSRs) from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) (Chapter 2, 3 and 4), and the subsequent implementation of these tools in a pipeline for narrowing down QTL intervals to facilitate the identification of candidate genes for the QTL (Chapter 5). Chapter 1 provides an introduction to molecular markers, SNP and SSR markers, illustrated {{by a number of}} applications of molecular markers, as well as existing programs for their detection. After analysis of existing problems and programs for the detection SNPs, a new algorithm is described to reliably identify SNPs and indels in EST data from diploid and polyploid species (Chapter 2). The algorithm is implemented in a program called QualitySNP. This program uses three filters to identify reliable SNPs: filter one screens for potential SNPs by requiring at least two sequences per represented allele; filter two uses a haplotype-based strategy to filter out clusters with paralogs and false SNPs caused by sequence errors; finally, filter three calculates a confidence score for every putative SNP according to the number of occurrences of each allele in high and low quality regions. For the detection of non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNP), synonymous SNPs and SNPs in UTRs, a program was developed as well. Furthermore, these programs were implemented in a pipeline that includes the identification of SNPs and nsSNPs, as well as a storage and retrieval system. Using this pipeline, large numbers of SNPs could be identified in potato ESTs. QualitySNP is available for running on LINUX and UNIX systems; the program, user manual and examples are available at [URL]. Chapter 3 describes a web-based implementation of the QualitySNP algorithm, called HaploSNPer, which is a tool for the detection of alleles and SNPs in user-specified input sequences from both diploid and polyploid species. HaploSNPer tries to find homologous sequences in user-specified sequence databases using a user-supplied seed sequence, or in a collection of input sequences. All alleles and associated SNPs are identified on clusters of these homologous sequences using QualitySNP. HaploSNPer provides a user-friendly interface for visualization of SNPs and alleles, which allows the selection of informative SNPs and allele specific makers. Currently HaploSNPer is available for nine animal and thirteen plant species, and is available from [URL]. Chapter 4 presents a new tool, called PolySSR, to identify polymorphic SSRs rather than just SSRs based on public EST sequence data derived from heterozygotes and/or different genotypes. Based on PolySSR a pipeline was developed to automatically develop primers for putatively polymorphic SSR markers, taking into account SNPs in the SSR flanking regions, thus improving the success rate of the potential markers. Furthermore, <b>SSR</b> positions in <b>coding</b> or UTR regions of genes are identified by the pipeline. The pipeline also includes a searchable database for these SSRs. The value of PolySSR was demonstrated by the fact that nearly all tested SSRs predicted to be polymorphic were indeed validated as polymorphic, and also most designed primers produced clear amplicons. Large numbers of polymorphic SSRs were identified from publicly available ESTs in potato, tomato, rice, Arabidopsis, brassica and chicken using the pipeline. They are stored into a database, which is available at [URL]. PolySSR not only decreases the cost of designing and testing primers, it also brings a new approach to use the redundancy and heterozygosity of ESTs for developing SSRs that was ignored before. Analysis of the data obtained with polySSR showed that a larger percentage of short SSRs identified in the species used in the study were polymorphic than that of long SSRs. From this it is clear that in the past we have ‘forgotten’ a whole class of putatively informative markers. QualitySNP and PolySSR have been implemented into a pipeline called GeneTagger to find candidate genes underlying a QTL using the strategy of narrowing the QTL interval (Chapter 5). The pipeline first detects the syntenic region of a QTL interval in the species under study in a model species based on marker sequences linked to the QTL. Next, within the syntenic regions identified in the model species genes are identified that might have a function related to the QTL or genes within the regions that are not part of a large gene family. Based on their map position in the model species a number of genes are selected for marker development. To facilitate marker development, ESTs derived from the target species are analyzed using QualitySNP, PolySSR and other tools. Based on identified genetic variations in the selected genes, molecular markers can be developed for accurate fine-mapping of the QTL and ultimately identification of the gene underlying the QTL effect. The pipeline has been used to narrow the clubroot resistance QTL. The tool is available from the website [URL]. Finally, merits and shortcomings of the tools that have been developed as well as related bioinformatics questions that arose during these studies are discussed in Chapter 6...|$|R
