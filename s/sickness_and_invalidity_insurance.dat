40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} effect of a {{tailored}} professional intervention, including academic detailing, on antibiotic prescribing for acute cough. Methods: In a cluster-randomized controlled before and after study 85 Flemish GPs included adult patients with acute cough consulting in the periods February–April 2000 and 2001. The intervention consisted of a clinical practice guideline for acute cough, an educational outreach visit and a postal reminder to support its implementation in January 2001. Antibiotic prescribing rates and patients’ symptom resolution were the main outcome measures. Results: Thirty-six of 42 GPs received the intervention and 35 of 43 GPs served as controls; 1503 patients were eligible for analysis. Only in the intervention group were patients less likely to receive antibiotics after the intervention [ORadj (95 % CI) 5 0. 56 (0. 36 – 0. 87) ]. Prescribed antibiotics were also more in line with the guideline in the intervention group [1. 90 (0. 96 – 3. 75) ] and less expensive {{from the perspective of the}} National <b>Sickness</b> <b>and</b> <b>Invalidity</b> <b>Insurance</b> Institute {MDadj (95 % CI) 5 –e 6. 89 [211. 77 2 (22. 02) ]}.

40|$|For {{roughly two}} decades now, {{commentators}} from different political camps have pronounced {{the welfare state}} in crisis. Journalistic commentators, primarily those with a neoliberal bent, claim {{that it is too}} expensive, no longer affordable under conditions of slower economic growth, and that it needs to be greatly cut back in order to stimulate economic growth. Political commentators on the left and academics worry that expenditures are misallocated and privilege some groups at the expense of others, and they argue that the welfare state needs to be thoroughly restructured (Esping-Andersen 1999, 2002; Pierson 2001 a). The debate about restructuring is to a large part carried out in terms of the “old ” versus the “new ” welfare state, or welfare states designed to deal with old versus new social risks.

The human capital method {{was used for the}} calculation of indirect costs, as this is the most common method applied in published studies. As not all detailed data on expenditures were available, the missing data were collected in the retrospective patient research. Total annual costs in 2010 for 6. 100 dispensed patients with MS in Slovakia were € 54. 723. 592. Indirect costs (€ 31. 728. 757) prevailed over direct costs (€ 22. 994. 834).

The new Act laid down that people who satisfied its conditions were entitled to these noncontributory benefits. Unlike the National Assistance scheme, which operated like state charity for the worst-off, the new Supplementary Benefits scheme was a right of every citizen who found himself or herself in severe difficulties. Those persons over the retirement age with no means who {{were considered to be}} unable to live on the basic pension (which provided less than what the government deemed as necessary for subsistence) became entitled to a [...] "long term" [...] allowance of an extra few shillings a week. Some simplification of the procedure for claiming benefits was also introduced. From 1966, an exceptionally severe disablement allowance was added “for those claimants receiving constant attendance allowance which was paid to those with the higher or intermediate rates of constant attendance allowance and who were exceptionally severely disabled.” Redundancy payments were introduced in 1965 to lessen the impact of unemployment, and earnings-related benefits for maternity, unemployment, <b>sickness,</b> industrial injuries <b>and</b> widowhood were introduced in 1966, followed by the replacement of flat-rate family allowances with an earnings-related scheme in 1968. From July 1966 onwards, the temporary allowance for widow of severely disabled pensioners was extended from 13 to 26 weeks. Increases were made in pensions and other benefits during Wilson's first year in office that were the largest ever real term increases carried out up until that point.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the European System of Integrated Social Protection Statistics (ESSPROS), {{developed}} by the Statistical Office of the European Community, social expenditure for all EU-countries have been newly recorded on a standardized base, thereby enabling meaningful comparative analysis. According to this new system, Austrian social expenditure in 1995 totaled ATS 694 billion, equivalent to 29. 5 percent of GDP. Since 1980, current social protection expenditure rose by 157 percent and as a ratio of GDP by 2 ½ percentage points. During the 1980 's, changes in the social outlays/GDP ratio were dominated by cyclical variations: it rose over the period of sluggish growth until 1987, but fell back with the subsequent recovery – eventually even below the 1980 level. In the early 1990 's however, it ratcheted upwards, due to a number of discretionary raises in benefits such as an extension of paid maternity leave higher pension entitlements for women, family tax credits and nursing care benefits. In 1995, the rise in the social expenditure/GDP ratio leveled off, despite a cyclical weakening accompanied by a rise in unemployment. Also in 1996, the ratio may have remained flat in view of measures to cut the government deficit. Since 1980, the expenditure components showing the strongest increase are unemployment benefits (+ 660 percent rise) <b>and</b> <b>invalidity</b> pensions (+ 225 percent). Old-age pension outlays (+ 175 percent) also expanded above-average because of discretionary benefit increases and the system maturing (with new retires having acquired progressively longer entitlement periods). The relative importance of social expenditure in Austria is similar to that in other European countries with comparable economic and social structure. As a proportion of GDP, it is slightly above the EU-average for 1994, which is dampened by the absence of Sweden (prior to accession) and the very low level of social spending in the southern European countries. For the EU as a whole, the ratio has moved up by 4 ¼ percentage points since 1980; apart from a catching-up effect in southern Europe, strong advances in the U. K. (+ 6 percentage points), Denmark and France (+ 5 points each) have contributed to this development. The structural composition of social outlays in Austria differs markedly from the EU-average insofar, as old-age pensions (Austria 49 percent, EU 44 percent) and family subsidies (11 versus 8 percent) claim a much larger share, whereas the share of spending on unemployment benefits (6 against 9 percent) as well as on <b>sickness</b> <b>and</b> <b>invalidity</b> payments (33 versus 35 percent) is distinctly lower in Austria than on the average of EU countries.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} German miners' model of mutual {{insurance}} from its introduction in 1854 to its basic reformation in 1923. Its core feature was {{the provision of}} cash benefits for compensation of income losses due to temporary <b>sickness</b> <b>and</b> permanent <b>invalidity</b> or death of the bread-winner. The carriers of the insurance scheme, the Knappschaften, date back to medieval times, and the Knappschaft is still present today as the second pillar of the German statutory old-age insurance. This paper aims to establish the Knappschaft insurance's main characteristics in the period under consideration. These include, for example, compulsory membership, shared financing between employed miners and entrepreneurs, selfmanagement, financing based on earnings-related social insurance contributions, a strong emphasis of the insurance principle, and application of the pay-as-you-go mechanism. The organisational analysis is complemented quantitatively, on the one hand, by evidence on increasing generosity and, on the other hand, evidence on increasing financial distress substantiating the shadow side of a maturing pay-as-you-go based scheme. In particular, Knappschaften experienced all trends we commonly associate with today's systems {{in the second half}} of the 20 th century as early as in the 19 th century, even before the Bismarckian insurance was installed from 1883 on: Increasing social security spending, rising pensioners-tocontributors ratios, concentration and pressure on finances forcing Knappschaften to adjust their fiscal policy according to the mechanics of pay-as-you-go.

60|$|Well now, it is {{said that}} in {{adopting}} the policy of contributory insurance the Government have admitted that they were wrong in establishing old-age pensions upon the non-contributory basis. Now I do not think that is true. There is no inconsistency or contradiction between a non-contributory system of old-age pensions and a contributory system of <b>insurance</b> against unemployment, <b>sickness,</b> <b>invalidity,</b> <b>and</b> widowhood. The circumstances and conditions are entirely different. The prospect of attaining extreme old age, of living beyond threescore years and ten, which is the allotted span of human life, seems so doubtful and remote to the ordinary man, when in the full strength of manhood, that it has been found in practice almost impossible to secure from any very great number of people the regular sacrifices which are necessary to guard against old age.|$|R
40|$|The Social Security Scheme was {{launched}} in 1990, covering formal sector private employees for non-work related <b>sickness,</b> maternity <b>and</b> <b>invalidity</b> including cash benefits and funeral grants. The scheme is financed by tripartite contributions from government, employers and employees, each of 1. 5 % of payroll (total of 4. 5 %). The scheme decided to pay health care providers, whether public or private, on a flat rate capitation basis to cover both ambulatory and inpatient care. Registration of the insured with a contractor hospital was a necessary consequence of the chosen capitation payment system. The aim {{of this paper is}} to review the operation of the scheme, and to explore the implications of capitation payment and registration for utilisation levels and provider behaviour. A key weakness of the scheme's design is suggested to be the initial decision to give employers not employees the responsibility for choosing the registered hospitals. This was done for administrative reasons, but it contributed to low levels of use of the contractor hospitals. In addition, low levels of use were also probably the result of the potential for cream skimming, cost shifting from inpatient to ambulatory care and under-provision of patient care, though since monitoring mechanisms by the Social Security Office were weak, these effects are difficult to detect conclusively. Mechanisms to improve utilisation levels were gradually introduced, such as employee choice of registered hospitals and the formation of sub-contractor networks to improve access to care. A beneficial effect of the capitation payment system was that the Social Security Fund generated substantial reserves <b>and</b> expenditures on <b>sickness</b> benefits were well stabilised. The paper ends by recommending that future policy amendments should be guided by research and empirical findings and that tougher monitoring and enforcement of quality of care standards are required.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Discussion Paper is to {{estimate}} the social costs of back pain in the UK and assess the potential for reducing these costs by increasing the appropriateness of management of back pain. 50 % to 80 % of the population suffer from back pain at some stage of their life. With or without treatment, 90 % of back pain problems improve within six weeks, but repeated episodes are very common. Although back pain and its management {{has been the subject}} of several thousand research papers over the past three decades, it still remains something of an enigma. Only 15 % of cases can be clearly diagnosed. However, the great majority are due to mechanical low back pain which is the focus of this paper. Due to the paucity of data it is only possible to make crude estimates of the costs of back pain to the NHS, and these probably lie between £ 265 million and £ 383 million. Most of these costs are generated in 1) General Practice, due to the large number of consultations, and 2) Hospital in-patient management, due to the high treatment cost per person. Between 1986 <b>and</b> 1992 <b>sickness</b> <b>and</b> <b>invalidity</b> benefit claims for back pain alone increased in the UK by about 104 %, while claims for other causes of sickness increased by 60 %. The intangible costs of back pain and disability affecting the individual are likely to be considerable. When the problem has become chronic and intractable after about six months, the individual’s function and social activities may become severely curtailed. The General Practitioner is the key worker for back pain patients, and recent data suggests that these account for between 5. 8 to 8. 6 million consultations every year. Most consultations are associated with a prescription for medication, and advice to rest, despite the fact that the evidence is heavily weighted towards early resumption of normal activities. The processes are not well understood and treatment therefore is usually palliative. High quality outcome research is hampered by a number of problems, such as diagnostic ambiguity, and the powerful effect of a placebo in reducing pain. There is some evidence of the usefulness of spinal manipulation, exercise and patient education to reduce back pain disability, although more research is needed to clarify which particular interventions are most effective for which category of problem. In the UK, the use of 900, 000 hospital bed days each year for back pain patients requires careful review. Hospitalisation is not only expensive, but also in combination with prolonged bed rest and excessive investigations may be harmful, unless surgery is clearly indicated. Risk factors for back pain include manual handling, static postures, vibration exposure and smoking. Both physical and psychosocial factors in the workplace have been linked with back pain. A number of intervention studies have indicated that both primary and secondary prevention of back pain and injuries in the workplace can be cost effective, but this work is incomplete. Once the back pain has become chronic, more aggressive rehabilitation programmes appear to be the most effective way of returning individuals to their previous occupation. The goal is to reduce the disability that may result from mechanical lower back pain by appropriate active management. Reviews of the literature have pointed to more effective approaches to managing the problem of common low back pain, but these now need to be translated into practice to ensure that resources are used effectively. back pain, expenditure, cost...|$|R
