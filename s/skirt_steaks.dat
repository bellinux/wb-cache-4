5000|$|Plate steak: (also {{known as}} the short plate) is from the front belly of the cow, just below the rib cut. The short plate {{produces}} types of steak such as the <b>skirt</b> <b>steak</b> and the hanger steak. It is typically a cheap, tough and fatty meat.|$|R
5000|$|Flank steak: From the underside, {{the abdomen}} {{muscles of the}} cow.

5000|$|The {{plate is}} the other source of short ribs, used for pot roasting, and the outside <b>skirt</b> <b>steak,</b> which is used for fajitas.

50|$|Chicken {{generally}} includes low fat in {{the meat}} itself (castrated roosters excluded). The fat is highly concentrated on the skin. A 100g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 grams of fat and 31 grams of protein, compared to 10 grams of fat and 27 grams of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean <b>skirt</b> <b>steak.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Puerto Rico {{it always}} refers to <b>skirt</b> <b>steak,</b> cooked on a {{barbecue}} grill. The chimichurri sauce is optional, since {{the meat is}} very savory with just a slight hint of sea salt that is sprinkled over the meat during cooking. It is also customary to replace chimichurri sauce with a guava rum sauce made with spices and 7up or Ajilimójili sauce.|$|R

500|$|The {{recipe for}} a Cornish pasty, as defined by its {{protected}} status, includes diced or minced beef, onion, potato and swede in rough chunks along with some [...] "light peppery" [...] seasoning. The cut of beef used is generally <b>skirt</b> <b>steak.</b> Swede is sometimes called turnip in Cornwall, but the recipe requires use of actual swede, not turnip. Pasty ingredients are usually seasoned with salt and pepper, depending on individual taste. The use of carrot in a traditional Cornish pasty is frowned upon, though it does appear regularly in recipes.|$|R
50|$|The flank is used {{mostly for}} grinding, {{except for the}} long and flat flank steak, best known for use in London broil, and the inside <b>skirt</b> <b>steak,</b> also used for fajitas. Flank steaks were {{once one of the}} most {{affordable}} steaks, because they are substantially tougher than the more desirable loin and rib steaks. Many modern recipes for flank steak use marinades or moist cooking methods, such as braising, to improve the tenderness and flavor. This, combined with a new interest in these cuts' natural leanness, has increased the price of the flank steak.|$|R
5000|$|Anatomically speaking, the hanger steak is the crura, or legs, of the {{diaphragm}}. The steak {{is said to}} [...] "hang" [...] {{from the}} diaphragm of the heifer or steer. The diaphragm is one muscle, commonly cut into two separate cuts of meat: the hanger steak, traditionally considered more flavorful, and the outer <b>skirt</b> <b>steak,</b> composed of tougher muscle from {{the dome of the}} diaphragm. The hanger is attached to the last rib and to the front of several of the lumbar vertebrae. The right side is larger and stronger than the left.|$|R

5|$|Poultry {{meat and}} eggs provide nutritionally {{beneficial}} food containing protein of high quality. This {{is accompanied by}} low levels of fat which have a favourable mix of fatty acids. Chicken meat contains about {{two to three times}} as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when measured by weight. However, for boneless, skinless chicken breast, the amount is much lower. A 100-g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 g of fat and 31 g of protein, compared to 10 g of fat and 27 g of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean <b>skirt</b> <b>steak.</b>|$|R
500|$|A steak (...) is a meat {{generally}} sliced {{across the}} muscle fibers, potentially including a bone. Exceptions, {{in which the}} meat is sliced parallel to the fibers, include the <b>skirt</b> <b>steak</b> that is cut from the plate, the flank steak that is cut from the abdominal muscles, and the Silverfinger steak that is cut from the loin and includes three rib bones. When the word [...] "steak" [...] is used without qualification, it generally refers to a beefsteak.

It can be grilled, pan-fried, broiled, or braised for increased tenderness. Grain (meat fibre) is very apparent in flank steaks, as it comes from a well-exercised part of the cow, and many chefs cut across the grain to make the meat more tender. Flank steak is best when it has a bright red color. It is frequently used in Asian cuisine, often sold in Chinese markets as [...] "stir-fry beef".|$|R
