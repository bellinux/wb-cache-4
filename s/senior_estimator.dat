As a consequence, the learning curve from a trainee estimator to <b>senior</b> <b>estimator</b> could be an undisclosed {{amount of time and}} largely falls into the responsibility of the employer and or <b>senior</b> <b>estimator</b> to determine time scale and progression of trainee estimators.|$|E

Therefore, it is common for estimators in the construction industry to experience a great deal of stress. An appropriate coping behaviour can help estimators to adjust to stress, thereby optimizing their estimation performance. This study aims at identifying estimators' stress-coping behaviours and the impact of these behaviours on estimation performance. In order to understand the stress management of estimators in the industry, the paper investigates the impacts of stress-coping behaviours for two experienced estimator groups with different working experience in Hong Kong. Using correlation analysis and regression analysis, the relationships among stress, coping behaviours and estimation performance were examined. The results revealed that <b>senior</b> <b>estimators</b> normally apply problem-focused coping behaviours to alleviate the stress encountered in their jobs and to improve their estimation performance. A moderate level of stress supports project estimation for project estimators and the cooperative relationship between colleagues for <b>senior</b> <b>estimators.</b> It is suggested that time and stress management training be provided to <b>senior</b> <b>estimators</b> in order to relieve their stress effectively and ensure work efficiency, while a good team spirit should also be fostered in a company to encourage constructive relationships and thus improve estimation performance.
