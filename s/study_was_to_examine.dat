25|$|Piaget {{argued that}} {{children}} and adults used speech for different purposes. In order to confirm his argument, he experimented analyzing a child’s interpretation of a story. In the experiment, the child listened to a story and then told a friend that same story in his/her/their own words. The purpose of this <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> how children verbalize and understand each other without adult intervention. Piaget wanted to examine the limits of naturalistic observation, {{in order to understand}} a child’s reasoning. He realized the difficulty of studying children's thoughts, as {{it is hard to know}} if a child is pretending to believe their thoughts or not. Piaget was the pioneer researcher to examine children’s conversations in a social context – starting from examining their speech and actions – where children were comfortable and spontaneous (Kose, 1987).|$|E
2500|$|His work Hypnosis and Suggestibility (1933) was a {{rigorous}} {{study of the}} phenomenon, using statistical and experimental analysis. Hull's studies demonstrated emphatically {{once and for all}} that hypnosis is not related to sleep ("hypnosis is not sleep, … it has no special relationship to sleep, and the whole concept of sleep when applied to hypnosis obscures the situation"). His research even goes as {{far as to say that}} hypnosis is the opposite of sleep, because he found that hypnosis gave responses linked to alertness rather than lethargy. [...] In Hull’s research, some of his subjects even felt that hypnotism made their sensitivity and alertness better. [...] In fact, many of Hull’s subjects in hypnotic states did believe that their senses had increased. They genuinely thought their senses were better, but this was never proven to be a significant result. The main question of Hull's <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the veracity of the apparently extravagant claims of hypnotists, especially regarding extraordinary improvements of cognition or the senses by hypnosis.|$|E

The Focus Foundation sought to extend the results from a single child interacting with these mechanical toys to interactions between two children while engaging with the toys. Shared play was observed in the context of a variety of different robots and/or mechanized animals to see what increased social engagement behaviors.|$|E
50|$|Another {{study by}} Pfau {{and his colleagues}} (1992) {{examined}} the role of inoculation when attempting to prevent adolescents from smoking. One of the main goals of the <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> longevity and persistence of inoculation. They took a group of elementary school students in South Dakota and had the students watch a video warning them of future pressures to smoke. In the first year, resistance was highest among those with low self-esteem (Pfau et al., 1992). At {{the end of the}} second year, students in the group showed more attitudinal resistance to smoking than they did previously (Pfau & Van Bockern 1994). Importantly, the study and its follow-up demonstrate the long-lasting effects of inoculation treatments.|$|E

50|$|The SilEye-Alteino and Anomalous Long Term Effects in Astronauts' Central Nervous System (ALTEA) {{projects}} {{have investigated the}} phenomenon aboard the International Space Station, using helmets similar in nature {{to those in the}} ALFMED experiment. The SilEye project has also examined the phenomenon on Mir. The purpose of this <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the particle tracks entering the eyes of the astronauts when the astronaut said they observed a LF. In examining the particles, the researchers hoped to gain a deeper understanding of what particles might be causing the LF. Astronauts wore the SilEye detector over numerous sessions while on Mir. During those sessions, when they detected a LF, they pressed a button on a joystick. After each session, they recorded down their comments about the experience. Particle tracks that hit the eye during the time when the astronauts indicated that they detected a LF would have had to pass through silicon layers, which were built to detect protons and nuclei and distinguish between them.|$|E
