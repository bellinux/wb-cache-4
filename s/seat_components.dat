50|$|The seat is {{considered}} third generation and includes advanced features. For example, it senses {{the conditions of}} the ejection (airspeed and altitude) and selects the appropriate drogue and main parachute deployments to minimize the forces on the occupant. The seat is controlled by a fully redundant digital electronic sequencer which makes the decisions and initiates the appropriate <b>seat</b> <b>components</b> to allow the seat to fly through the air and safely descend the aircrew to the ground. The sequencer includes a crash data recorder that contains ejection information that can be later analyzed during crash investigations to understand the dynamics of the ejection as well as loads on the aircrew during the event. The seat propulsion system is specially designed with technology to compensate for aircrew weight so that the 103 lb small female aircrew gets a similar acceleration to the 245 lb male pilot. The seat has been updated over the years through pre-planned product improvement programs to include digital sequencing, additional redundancy, enhance stability, limb restraints, structural upgrading, and passive head/neck restraints. The ACES II seat ejection injury rate is one of the lowest in the world as proven in over 600 live ejections.

40|$|Many {{off-road}} {{machines are}} equipped with a suspension seat intended to minimize the vibration exposure of the operator to vertical vibration. The optimization of the isolation characteristics of a suspension seat involves consideration of the dynamic responses of the various components of the seat. Ideally, the <b>seat</b> <b>components</b> would be optimized using a numerical model of the seat. However, seat suspensions are complex with non-linear characteristics {{that are difficult to}} model; the development of seat suspensions is therefore currently more empirical than analytical. This paper presents and compares two alternative methods of modelling the non-linear dynamic behaviour of two suspension seats whose dynamic characteristics were measured in the laboratory. A ‘lumped parameter model’, which represented the dynamic responses of individual <b>seat</b> <b>components,</b> was compared with a global ‘Bouc–Wen model’ having a non-linear degree-of-freedom. Predictions of the vibration dose value for a load placed on the seats were compared with laboratory measurements. The normalized r. m. s. errors between the predictions and the measurements were also determined. The median absolute difference between the measured and predicted seat surface vibration dose values over all test conditions for both models was less than 6 % of the measured value (with an inter-quartile range less than 20 %). Both models were limited by deficiencies in the simulation of top end-stop impacts after the load lifted from the seat surface. The lumped parameter model appears best suited {{to the development of the}} overall design of a suspension seat. The Bouc–Wen model can provide a useful simulation of an existing seat and assist the optimization of an individual component in the seat, without measuring the dynamic properties of components in the seat except those of the component being optimized...|$|E

The performance of commer-cially available adaptive <b>seating</b> <b>components</b> in a dynamic or impact situation, as well as their effect on the safety of the user, is unknown and should be determined. The main objective of the project was to develop a test methodology to statically determine the crashworthiness of wheelchair head-rest systems and show the efficacy of that methodology by applying it to several commercially available headrest sys-tems. The methodology was based on Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) test conditions, which use static test procedures to ensure that vehicle head restraints will perform adequately during actual crash conditions. The procedure developed to evaluate the headrests gave informative and repeatable results. The tests performed calculated the energy associated with a critical deformation of the headrest under quasi-static conditions. The results were used to determine the level of safety provided by the devices and to recommend design improvements. The headrests tested exhibited similar modes of deformation due to bending of a vertical adjustment bar, and several devices were determined to be capable of providing adequate restraint in an impact situation.

40|$|This study {{suggests}} that contemporary modular acetabular shell designs employing ceramic liners deform during implantation where acetabular bed under-reaming is employed. The liner retention strength did not degrade by comparison to non-deformed shells using ASTM static push-out methods. A larger question, however, is the influence of this deformation on liner retention strength over time when both bone remodeling and cyclic activity occur. The idealization of component seating in the laboratory where surface contaminants, component position, and loading are controlled does not typify the operating room environment where liner seating is often an issue. Nevertheless, in this optimal situation, shell deformation was consistently observed as was striping on outer ceramic liner surfaces. Factors influencing the failure to <b>seat</b> <b>components,</b> as has been reported, need to be further documented. This study evaluates both metal banded and non-banded ceramic liners of like ceramic composition where a taper lock is utilized to achieve fixation.

40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{cementing}} technique in hip resurfacing has been poorly studied to date. The hip resurfacing prosthesis is unique in the family of cemented prostheses because the cement mantle is blind (hidden underneath the implant) and is radiographically obscured. This presents an immediate challenge to the surgeon {{at the time of}} surgery, but also has a longer-term implication in terms of lack of post-operative clinical observation. This should be compared with total hip replacement or total knee replacement where the cement mantle can at least be partially observed both intra- and post-operatively. With this in mind, the objective of this review is, firstly, to understand the cement mantles typically achieved in current clinical practice and, secondly, to identify those factors affecting the cement mantle and to consolidate them into an improved and reproducible cementing technique. The outcome of this work shows that the low-viscosity technique can commonly lead to excessive cement penetration in the proximal femoral head and an incompletely <b>seated</b> <b>component,</b> whereas a more consistent controlled cement mantle can be achieved with a high-viscosity cementing technique. Consequently, it is recommended that a high-viscosity technique should be used to minimize the build-up of excessive cement, to reduce the temperature created by the exothermic polymerization, and to help to ensure correct seating of the prosthesis. A combination of these factors is potentially critical to the clinical success of some articular surface replacement (ASR) procedures. It {{is important to note that}} we specifically studied the DePuy ASR system; therefore only the general principles (and not the specifics) of the cementing technique may apply to other resurfacing prostheses, because of differences in internal geometry, clearance, and surgical technique...|$|R

The vibration from the road and other sources in the car like the engine are transmitted to the seat through the different paths which can be the cause of rattling noise in different frequency ranges from the seat. Seat structure as well as its components can be sources of rattle noise based on their physical characteristics. Therefore the main objective of this project was to characterize the acoustic signature of the seat rattle noise which can be used for noise source identification and structural NVH optimization. For this purpose, different noise measurement and structural tests were done on a Holden VE passenger seat manufactured by FUTURIS Company. A sine sweep from 5 - 100 Hz was used as the input vibration for the tests to simulate the real life driving conditions and the vibration and noise responses of the seat were measured and analysed using different equipment and software packages.

The three-dimensional data used for modelling thigh and buttock geometry were taken on one 95 th percentile male subject, representing the bivariate percentiles of the combined hip breadth (seated) and buttock-to-knee length distributions of a selected Australian and US population. A thigh-buttock surface shell based on this data was generated for the analytic model. A 6 mm neoprene layer was offset from the shell {{to account for the}} compression of body tissue expected through sitting in a seat. The thigh-buttock model is therefore made of two layers, covering thin to moderate thigh and buttock proportions, but not more fleshy sizes. To replicate the effects of skin and fat, the neoprene rubber layer was modelled as a hyperelastic material with viscoelastic behaviour in a Neo-Hookean material model. Finite element (FE) analysis was performed in ANSYS V 13 WB (Canonsburg, USA). It is hypothesized that the presented FE simulation delivers a valid result, compared to a standard SAE physical test and the real phenomenon of human-seat indentation. The analytical model is based on the CAD assembly of a Ford Territory seat. The optimized seat frame, suspension and foam pad CAD data were transformed and meshed into FE models and indented by the two layer, soft surface human FE model. Converging results with the least computational effort were achieved for a bonded connection between cushion and seat base as well as cushion and suspension, no separation between neoprene and indenter shell and a frictional connection between cushion pad and neoprene. The result is compared to a previous {{simulation of}} an indentation with a hard shell human finite-element model of equal geometry, and to the physical indentation result, which is approached with very high fidelity. We conclude that (a) 	SAE composite buttock form indentation of a suspended seat cushion can be validly simulated in a FE model of merely similar geometry, but using a two-layer hard/soft structure. (b) 	Human-seat indentation of a suspended seat cushion can be validly simulated with a simplified human buttock-thigh model for a selected anthropomorphism...|$|E
40|$|High-tone {{extensor}} thrust {{is common}} to those with cerebral palsy and those suffering spinal cord injuries. It is a muscle-control phenomenon that causes the body to straighten spastically. One goal of this thesis is to design a dynamic seating system that moves {{with respect to the}} wheelchair frame, allowing the seat to move with the user during an extensor thrust and reduce forces. One unique challenge is that the seat needs to remain rigid during normal functional activities and only become dynamic when an involuntary thrust is detected. A second goal of this thesis is to design a control scheme that is able to differentiate between these two types of motion. These design goals are initially investigated with a hinged-seatback system, instrumented with sensors to allow for the detection of thrusts and to actively control <b>seating</b> <b>components.</b> A full <b>seating</b> system is then built to allow for full-body extensor thrusts, involving the seatback, seat bottom, and leg rest of the wheelchair. This system is analyzed for effectiveness of reducing forces on the body during an extensor thrust. Another serious problem for this segment of the population is pressure ulcers. These are caused by prolonged pressure on the skin from weight-bearing bony prominences. Various seating system configurations are known to help with pressure relief. The three standard configurations for a chair are tilt, recline, and standing. The final goal of this thesis is to measure and compare the effectiveness of these three methods for their ability to relieve pressure on the seat bottom. To accomplish this, a powered wheelchair with built-in capabilities for recline and standing is mounted to a tilting mechanism. Test subjects are used to experimentally compare the effectiveness of each method for pressure reduction using pressure mats on all weight-bearing surfaces.

Minimal mass and multi-functionality are not aesthetic guidelines but a simple necessity.The microgravity projects, conducted since 1998 {{in collaboration with the}} department for astronautics, Prof. Dr. Eduard Igenbergs, at TU Munich and NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, put their main emphasis on the formulation of design criteria for the functional organization of workplaces and leisure areas on board the ISS. Individual groups proposed solutions for standardized sanitary, sleeping and living racks within the habitation module.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]30-378 Weatherby Magnum {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{accurate}} rifle cartridges. The cartridge held the world record for accuracy at 1000 yd for over thirty years. Given factory ammunition, Weatherby guarantees 1.5 MOA accuracy from their Weatherby Mark V action rifles and sub-MOA (.99 MOA or better) accuracy from their Range Certified line of rifles and Vanguard rifle lines. Careful handloading - checking for bullet jacket concentricity, weighing of brass and bullets, uniformity of case length and overall cartridge length, choice of <b>components,</b> <b>seating</b> of bullet - can all increase the accuracy of the cartridge.|$|R
