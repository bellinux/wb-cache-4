5000|$|During Richard's absence in the Holy Land {{and during}} his captivity, the Jews of England were harassed by William de Longchamp. The Jewish {{community}} {{was forced to}} contribute toward the king's ransom 5,000 marks, {{more than three times}} as much as the contribution of the City of London. On his return, Richard determined to organise the Jewish community {{in order to ensure that}} he should no longer be defrauded, by any such outbreaks as those that occurred after his coronation, of his just dues as universal legatee of the Jewry. Richard accordingly decided, in 1194, that records should be kept by royal officials of all the transactions of the Jews, without which such transactions would not be legal. Every debt was to be entered upon a chirograph, one part of which was to be kept by the Jewish creditor, and the other preserved in a chest to which only special officials should have access. By this means the king could at any time ascertain the property of any Jew in the land; and no destruction of the bond held by the Jew could release the creditor from his indebtedness. This [...] "Ordinance of the Jewry" [...] was, in practice, the beginning of the office of Exchequer of the Jews, which made all the transactions of the English Jewry liable to taxation by the King of England, who thus became a sleeping partner in all the transactions of Jewish money lending. The king besides demanded two bezants in the pound, that is, 10 per cent, of all <b>sums</b> <b>recovered</b> by the Jews with the aid of his courts.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a family of}} matrix dilogarithms, which are automorphisms of C^N tensor C^N, N being any odd positive integer, associated to hyperbolic ideal tetrahedra equipped with an additional decoration.

Together with the decoration, they arise from the solution we give of a symmetrization problem for a specific family of basic matrix dilogarithms, the classical (N= 1) one being the Rogers dilogarithm, which only satisfy one special instance of five-term identity. We use the matrix dilogarithms to construct invariant state sums for closed oriented 3 -manifolds $W$ endowed with a flat principal PSL(2,C) -bundle rho, and a fixed non empty link L if N> 1, and for (possibly "marked") cusped hyperbolic 3 -manifolds M.

We analyse the structural coincidences versus discrepancies between the cases N= 1 and N> 1, and we formulate "Volume Conjectures", having geometric motivations, about the asymptotic behaviour of the invariants when N tends to infinity.

40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} every {{operator}} system (and hence every unital operator algebra) has sufficiently many boundary represen-tations {{to generate the}} C*-envelope. We solve a 45 year old problem of William Arveson that is central to his approach to non-commutative dilation theory. We show that every operator system and every unital operator algebra has sufficiently many boundary representations to completely norm it. Thus the C*-algebra generated by {{the image of the}} direct sum of these maps is the C*-envelope. This was a central problem left open in Arveson’s seminal work [2] on dilation theory for arbitrary operator algebras. In the intervening years, the existence of the C*-envelope was established, but a general argument producing boundary representations has not been available. Arveson [2, 3] reformulated the classical dilation theory of Sz. Nagy [14] so that it made sense for an arbitrary unital closed subalgebra A of a C*-algebra. A central theme was the use of completely pos-itive and completely bounded maps. He proposed the existence of a family of special representations of A, called boundary representations, which have unique completely positive extensions to C∗(A) that are irreducible ∗-representations. The set of boundary representations is a noncommutative analogue of the Choquet boundary of a function alge-bra, i. e. the set of points with unique representing measures. Arveson proposed that there should be sufficiently many boundary representa-tions, so that their direct <b>sum</b> <b>recovers</b> the norm on Mn(A) for all n ≥ 1. In this case, he showed that the C*-algebra generated by this direct sum enjoys an important universal property, and provides a re-alization of the C*-envelope of A...|$|R
40|$|A compression-encryption {{method is}} {{described}} where a unique symmetric key is automatically generated {{as part of}} the compression step and it is dependent on the characteristics of the data. The file can only be decompressed with the corresponding generated key. It is the only method that can offer compression and encryption {{as part of the}} same process. Compression rates are higher than the vast majority of existing methods making it suitable for transmission over the network with reduced bandwidth requirements, massive storage reduction especially in a Cloud environment, reduced energy costs, and faster access times. The method involves a discrete cosine (DCT) transform applied to non-overlapping variable size pixel blocks to generate a set of coefficients (DC-coefficients and AC-coefficients) for each block. Each set of coefficients is quantised resulting in a DC array and an AC matrix. The AC matrix is compressed by eliminating blocks of data having only zero values and forming a reduced AC array from blocks of non-zero values. The reduced AC array is compressed by generating a unique key that is applied to each element in the array and summed over in a particular way to form a reduced, coded AC array. Both coded AC and DC arrays are subject to arithmetic coding whose outputs are included in the compressed file together with information about the unique key for that file. If the unique key is lost, the file cannot be decompressed. The decompression method is essentially the reverse process: reverse arithmetic coding, use the key to undo the <b>sum,</b> <b>recover</b> individual elements in the AC array and reconstruct the original AC matrix. These are then assembled together with the DC coefficients and the inverse DCT is applied recovering the original data...|$|R

The individual systems were evaluated for their strengths and weaknesses during field tests in Uniontown, Pennsylvania using KDKA-FM in Pittsburgh as the originating station. The Crosby system {{was rejected by the}} FCC because it was incompatible with existing subsidiary communications authorization (SCA) services which used various subcarrier frequencies including 41 and 67 kHz. Many revenue-starved FM stations used SCAs for [...] "storecasting" [...] and other non-broadcast purposes.

The GE and Zenith systems, so similar that they were considered theoretically identical, were formally approved by the FCC in April 1961 as the standard stereo FM broadcasting method in the United States and later adopted by most other countries. It is important that stereo broadcasts be compatible with mono receivers. For this reason, the left (L) and right (R) channels are algebraically encoded into sum (L+R) and difference (L−R) signals. A mono receiver will use just the L+R signal so the listener will hear both channels through the single loudspeaker.

40|$|Floquet topological {{insulators}} are {{systems in}} which the topology emerges out of equilibrium when a time periodic perturbation is applied. In these systems one can define quasi-energy states which replace the quilibrium stationary states. The system exhibits its non-trivial topology by developing edge localized quasi-energy states which lie in a gap of the quasi energy spectrum. These states represent a non-equilibrium analogue of the topologically protected edge-states in equilibrium topological insulators. In equilibrium these edge-states lead to very specific transport properties, in particular the two-terminal conductivity of these systems is $ 2 e^ 2 /h$. Here we explore the transport properties of the edge-states in a Floquet topological insulator. In {{stark contrast to the}} equilibrium result, we find that the two terminal conductivity of these edge states is significantly different from $ 2 e^ 2 /h$. This fact notwithstanding, we find that for certain external potential strengths the conductivity is smaller than $ 2 e^ 2 /h$ and robust to the effects of disorder and smooth changes to the Hamiltonian's parameters. This robustness is reminiscent of the robustness found in equilibrium topological insulators. We provide an intuitive understanding of the reduction of the conductivity in terms of scattering by photons. This leads us to consider a previously proposed Floquet <b>sum</b> rule which <b>recovers</b> the equilibrium value of $ 2 e^ 2 /h$ for the conductivity when edge states are present. We show that this sum rule holds in our system using both numerical and analytic techniques. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
