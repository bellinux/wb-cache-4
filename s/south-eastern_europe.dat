5|$|Macedonia (as {{a current}} {{geographical}} term) {{refers to a}} region of the Balkan peninsula in <b>south-eastern</b> <b>Europe,</b> covering some 60,000 or 70,000 square kilometers. Although the region's borders are not officially defined by any international organization or state, in some contexts, the territory appears to correspond to the basins of (from west to east) the Haliacmon (Aliákmonas), Vardar / Axios and Struma / Strymónas rivers, and the plains around Thessaloniki and Serres.|$|E
5|$|U 956 {{was first}} {{documented}} by Johannes Haquini Rhezelius (d. 1666), {{and later by}} Johan Peringskiöld (1710), who commented that the inscription was legible {{in spite of the}} stone having been split in two parts. Unlike modern scholars, Peringskiöld connected this stone, like the other Greece runestones, to the Gothic wars in <b>south-eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> from the 3rd century and onwards. Olof Celsius visited the stone three times, and the last time was in 1726 together with his nephew Anders Celsius. Olof Celsius noted that Peringskiöld had been wrong and that the stone was intact, although it gives an impression of being split in two, and the same observation was made by Richard Dybeck in 1866.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Leros, New Zealand withdrew its {{squadron}} {{from the}} Long Range Desert Group, compelling the LRDG to reorganise itself into two squadrons of eight patrols each. A Squadron {{was composed of}} Rhodesians and B Squadron comprised British troops and a squadron of signallers; around 80 of the officers and men were from Southern Rhodesia. The group was reassigned from the Middle East Command to the Central Mediterranean Force in early 1944, and deployed to the Gargano peninsula in south-eastern Italy, where a new LRDG headquarters was set up near the seaside town of Rodi. Britain hoped to compel the Germans to commit as many divisions as possible to <b>south-eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> so {{they could not be}} used on the more important fronts closer to Germany. In June 1944 the LRDG was assigned to operate on the western coast of Yugoslavia, with orders to set up observation posts, report the movements of German ships and undertake minor raids.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of the Tărtăria tablets in Romania by Nicolae Vlassa in 1961 reignited the debate.

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the fourteenth century the Ottomans rose to predominance in Asia Minor, and developed an empire that subjugated most of the Arab Islamic world as well as <b>south-eastern</b> <b>Europe.</b> The Ottomans patronized Persian literature for five and a half centuries and, because Asia Minor was more stable than eastern territories, they attracted great numbers of writers and artists, especially in the sixteenth century. The Ottomans developed distinctive styles of arts and letters. Unlike Persia they gradually shed some of their Persianate qualities. They gave up Persian as the court language, using Turkish instead; a decision that shocked the highly Persianized Mughals in India.|$|E
25|$|Bulgaria is {{a country}} {{situated}} in <b>south-eastern</b> <b>Europe,</b> bordering Romania to the north, Serbia and the Republic of Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east.

Considering its relatively small size, Bulgaria has {{a great variety of}} topographical features. Even within small parts of the country, the land may be divided into plains, plateaus, hills, mountains, basins, gorges, and deep river valleys.

25|$|The European Union {{promotes}} various initiatives regarding {{work-life balance}} and encourages its {{member states to}} implement family-friendly policies. In Europe, the Working Time Directive has implemented a maximum 48-hour working week. Many countries have opted for fewer hours. France introduced a 35-hour workweek. Contradictory to the Scandinavian countries, {{there is no evidence}} of state policies that absolutely encourage men to take on a larger share of domestic work in France, Portugal, or Britain. In a 2007, the European Quality of Life Survey found that countries in <b>south-eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> had the most common problems with work–life balance. In Croatia and Greece, a little over 70% of working citizens say that they are too tired to do household jobs at least several times a month because of work.|$|E
50|$|According to Anthony, the Pre-Germanic dialects {{may have}} {{developed}} in the Usatovo culture in <b>south-eastern</b> Central <b>Europe</b> between the Dniestr and the Vistula at ca. 3,100-2,800 BCE, and spread with the Corded Ware culture. Between 3100-2800/2600 BCE, a real folk migration of Proto-Indo-European speakers from the Yamna-culture took place into the Danube Valley, which eventually reached as far as Hungary, where pre-Celtic and pre-Italic may have developed. Slavic and Baltic developed at the middle Dniepr (present-day Ukraine).|$|R

40|$|The Greek {{debt crisis}} {{is poised to}} {{undermine}} already dwindling investment flows into <b>south-eastern</b> <b>Europe's</b> emerging economies, adding to barriers to recovery {{in one of the}} continent's most fragile regions. Greek lending in Central and Eastern Europe is concentrated mainly in Romania and Bulgaria, both struggling to recover from sharp economic contractions and most exposed to any scaling back in funding as Greece's banks shore up their own finances. Greece has been a major investor in the region- it is the second biggest in Serbia- since the fall of communism in 1989. Its problems have so far had only a limited impact on nearby states and it is unclear how much of a drag it may create. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development- B. E. R. D. - warned of potential hits to bank systems and economies and analysts have also raised concerns. Greek firms are also not expected to invest heavily in their usual target areas as they digest severe government cost cuts at home, while simple proximity to a country that has become the latest trouble spot on investors' radar may also be an issue. Greek banks could be the main canal to transmit the crisis in Romania. At the same time, the measures of prudenciality taken by Central Bank should counteract the possible difficulties for Romanian banking system.

25|$|Unlike Italy, however, Germany did not {{strive to}} achieve full autarky, {{even though in}} May of 1933, Hitler’s regime had {{defaulted}} unilaterally on Germany’s foreign debt along with a decree for sweeping capital controls that {{made it difficult to}} engage in foreign trade. Hitler was {{aware of the fact that}} Germany lacked reserves of raw materials, and full autarky was therefore impossible. Thus he chose a different approach. The Nazi government tried to limit the number of its trade partners, and, when possible, only trade with countries within the German sphere of influence. A number of bilateral trade agreements were signed between Germany and other European countries (mostly countries located in Southern and <b>South-Eastern</b> <b>Europe)</b> during the 1930s. The German government strongly encouraged trade with these countries but strongly discouraged trade with any others.|$|E
25|$|Football (soccer) {{is popular}} in Sarajevo; the city hosts FK Sarajevo and FK Željezničar, which both compete in European and {{international}} cups and tournaments and are {{have a very}} large trophy cabinet in the former Yugoslavia as well as independent Bosnia and Herzegovina. Other notable soccer clubs are FK Olimpik and SAŠK. Another popular sport is basketball; the basketball club KK Bosna Sarajevo won the European Championship in 1979 {{as well as many}} Yugoslav and Bosnian national championships {{making it one of the}} greatest basketball clubs in the former Yugoslavia. The chess club, Bosna Sarajevo, has been a championship team since the 1980s and is the third ranked chess club in Europe, having won four consecutive European championships in the nineties. RK Bosna also competes in the European Champions League and is considered one of the most well organised handball clubs in <b>South-Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> with a very large fan base and excellent national, as well as international results.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the crisis}} {{did not exist}} in a void; it came after a long series of {{diplomatic}} clashes between the Great Powers over European and colonial issues in the decade prior to 1914 which had left tensions high. The diplomatic clashes can be traced to changes in {{the balance of power in}} Europe since 1870. An example is the Baghdad Railway which was planned to connect the Ottoman Empire cities of Konya and Baghdad with a line through modern-day Turkey, Syria and Iraq. The railway became a source of international disputes during the years immediately preceding World War I. Although it has been argued that they were resolved in 1914 before the war began, it has also been argued that the railroad was a cause of the First World War. Fundamentally the war was sparked by tensions over territory in the Balkans. Austria-Hungary competed with Serbia and Russia for territory and influence in the region and they pulled the rest of the great powers into the conflict through their various alliances and treaties. The Balkan Wars were two wars in <b>South-eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> in 1912–1913 in the course of which the Balkan League (Bulgaria, Montenegro, Greece, and Serbia) first captured Ottoman-held remaining part of Thessaly, Macedonia, Epirus, Albania and most of Thrace and then fell out over the division of the spoils, with incorporation of Romania this time.|$|E
5000|$|The Usatovo culture {{developed}} in <b>south-eastern</b> Central <b>Europe</b> at around 3300-3200 BCE at the Dniestr river. Although {{closely related to}} the Tripolye culture, it is contemporary with the Yamna culture, and resembles it in significant ways. According to Anthony, it may have originated with [...] "steppe clans related to the Yamnaya horizon who were able to impose a patron-client relationship on Tripolye farming villages." [...] According to Anthony, the Pre-Germanic dialects may have {{developed in}} this culture between the Dniestr (west Ukraine) and the Vistula (Poland) at c. 3100-2800 BCE, and spread with the Corded Ware culture.|$|R
