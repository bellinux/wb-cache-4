5|$|David left London in March, {{arriving}} in Rome {{just before the}} Easter celebrations. She toured the country, watching cooks {{at home and in}} restaurants and making extensive notes on the regional differences in the cuisine. While in Rome she met the painter Renato Guttuso; deeply impressed by his work, particularly his still lifes, <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he would illustrate her book. To her surprise he agreed and, while considering the fee of £60 absurdly low, he kept to his word and produced a series of illustrations.|$|E
5|$|The {{sex scenes}} were choreographed by feminist writer and sex {{educator}} Susie Bright. The Wachowskis were fans of Bright {{and sent her}} {{a copy of the}} script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. When she read the script she loved it, particularly as it was about women enjoying having sex and not apologizing for it. Disappointed that they never described exactly {{what was happening in the}} sex scenes, <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> she could be a sex consultant for the film and they agreed. The main sex scene set in Corky's apartment was filmed in one long shot. The Wachowskis believed that this would look more realistic than several shots edited together. Although it should have been a closed set, there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.|$|E
25|$|Lee next {{answered}} {{a question about}} homosexuality at a Young PAP meeting in 2007. The questioner was Loretta Chen, an openly lesbian young PAP member and a bilingual theatre director in Singapore. <b>She</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> the current censorship rules in Singapore were too equivocal and where censorship was headed {{in the next two}} decades. Chen referred to a controversial play about Singaporean porn actress Annabel Chong, which explored pornography and alternative sexuality. Lee was then asked if he believed homosexuality was a product of nature or nurture. He replied that he had asked doctors about homosexuality and had been told that it was caused by a genetic random transmission of genes.|$|E
6000|$|Well, {{the last}} {{clearness}} now filled her. [...] "I'm {{not afraid of}} the inquisition. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>asks</b> <b>if</b> there's anything definite between us, I know perfectly what I shall say." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>She</b> <b>asks</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is the longest-running TV performer, with {{broadcast}} TV {{and cable}} TV, and still going. She {{has applied for}} the same to the Guinness Book of World Records.|$|R
5000|$|Later, Gabrielle {{goes over}} to Bree's house, {{explaining}} {{that there has been}} a change of plan because Carlos knows about them. <b>She</b> <b>asks</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> can stay with Bree and Bree agrees - but is shocked when Gaby also ushers in her daughters.|$|R
25|$|Perin Thomas: A {{student at}} AEHS. At first, Mia can't {{figure out whether}} Perin is {{a boy or a}} girl. She {{turns out to be a}} girl and becomes friends with Mia. She is again mistaken for a boy in Grandmère's musical, in which she is given a male role. Perin is a very nice person, as <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> Mia was alright after Michael announces he is moving to Japan, and, though shocked by Mia's new haircut in book eight, says nothing about it. She is also {{surprisingly}} strong and well-mannered. In book ten, it is continually implied that Perin and Ling Su are romantically involved with each other, though this is not confirmed but in the eleventh book Perin and Ling Su become a couple and together run The Frank Gianini Community center.|$|E
500|$|Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail criticised Home and Away for {{the amount}} of car {{accidents}} it features. When Miles nearly crashed his car, <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> anyone in Summer Bay is capable of [...] "sitting atop four wheels" [...] without nearly getting killed. Stephen was not a fan of Miles' long hair. When he returned in 2011, she said [...] "we can only hope that he’s seen a hairdresser since his departure." [...] When he left the series, Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap said that Home and Away [...] "won't be the same without Miles' shaggy barnet". Laura Morgan of All About Soap said that she and her colleagues were [...] "in mourning" [...] over Miles' exit. She added that they [...] "sorely missed" [...] him.|$|E
500|$|The {{depiction}} of King's rape {{and its aftermath}} was compared to similar storylines on other shows. Arrow called it part of the [...] "rape-on-TV trend", linking King's rape with those of Gemma Teller Morrow of FX's crime drama Sons of Anarchy and Naomi Clark of the CW teen drama 90210. According to Arrow, all three characters were [...] "strong, no-nonsense ladies who generally dominate their environments" [...] and did not report their rape. <b>She</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> each show's decision for the victim not to report the rape {{was part of a}} larger cultural belief that [...] "trusts in women who keep their silence". TV Fanatic Steve Marsi called the episode reminiscent of [...] in its presentation of events in real time and emphasis on character reactions. The Michigan Daily Alec Stern called sexual assault [...] "a crutch Shonda Rhimes has turned to in all three of her series", writing that the development of King's character was superior to the storyline of Mellie Grant's rape on the ABC drama Scandal.|$|E

5000|$|As Sun is {{awaiting}} for her pregnancy test results to show up, <b>she</b> <b>asks</b> Kate <b>if</b> <b>she</b> has ever taken a test, which she replies that she has. Sun thanks Kate {{for being there}} and not asking questions. When the test turns up positive, she does not seem too thrilled. <b>She</b> <b>asks</b> <b>if</b> it is accurate and they go to Jack to find out. He says those tests are very accurate, and that the two pink lines means she is definitely pregnant. Sun asks Jack to not tell anybody.|$|R
50|$|Chris {{prepares to}} leave town with a bartender, Sandy, whom he met while Roxanne was away. When <b>she</b> <b>asks</b> <b>if</b> he has told Roxanne (the women are acquaintances), he replies that he will write her a letter since he {{has a history of}} it.|$|R
500|$|Not all reviews were critical. WhatCulture {{reviewer}} Joseph Kratzer {{awarded the}} episode {{four out of}} five stars and wrote, [...] "Now that's what I'm talking about – few things are better in art than having your expectations overturned and 'The Pool Party' pleasantly surprised me with the efficacy of its execution." [...] Jeffrey Hyatt from ScreenCrave gave the episode a 9/10 rating and wrote, [...] "I think 'Pool Party' is my favorite episode so far this season. The Robert California and Erin/Dwight/Andy story lines were rock solid. Previous excursions out of the office have been blah, but the pool party setting really complimented the ensemble – and the sharp writing." [...] Michael Tedder from New York Magazine called the episode the season's second best, after [...] "Trivia." [...] In addition, many critics wrote positively of the characters and their actions. Jill Mader from InsidePulse wrote that while, [...] " [...] storyline itself was just OK... Ellie Kemper was hilarious." [...] Many reviewers, including McNutt and Forcella, found Kevin's lines and actions to be particularly memorable, most notably, his declaration that Val was racist after <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> Darryl could swim. A variety of reviewers found the cold-opening, featuring Jim pranking Dwight by placing meatballs in his desk in an attempt to make Stanley laugh, funny.|$|E
500|$|Lady Hale {{was also}} {{concerned}} about the ramifications of the decision. [...] <b>She</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> a doctor treating a patient after an accident and giving evidence about what happened as well as his opinions as to what would happen would be covered or not, or whether only in part. She noted that the ruling in the case would have to apply to experts dealing with cases before tribunals as well as courts, thus including claims for unfair dismissal before employment tribunals and disputes between landlord and tenants about service charges and rent assessments. [...] She queried whether it ought to extend to psychiatrists assessing patients for tribunal proceedings under the Mental Health Act 1983, or educational psychologists giving evidence about children with special educational needs in tribunal proceedings about their future education. In her view, these are [...] "sensitive and often highly fraught cases in which performing the expert's duty to the tribunal may well be perceived by the client patient or parent as a breach of her duty towards him." [...] In family law cases, she said, there would now be some professional witnesses who had immunity from negligence claims for their evidence and others who did not, with some of the distinctions between the two groups appearing to be [...] "arbitrary". She thought that the decision might make experts more likely to confirm their previous views rather than change them, and could lead to higher insurance premiums for experts, increased fees and the use of exemption clauses in contracts – [...] "in which case we shall be back where we started", she said. Overall, she called the decision to change the law [...] "irresponsible" [...] and, like Lord Hope, considered that the topic was best left to Parliament and the Law Commission.|$|E
500|$|Salvatore created Drizzt on {{the spur}} of the moment. He was under {{pressure}} to create a sidekick for Wulfgar in the Icewind Dale series. Salvatore had sent an early version of The Crystal Shard (what would become his first published novel) to TSR, and one day Kirchoff called him. She was on her way to a marketing meeting concerning the book, and informed him that they could not use one of the characters. He asked for time to think, but she was already late for the meeting. Off the top of his head, Salvatore said he had a Dark Elf. Kirchoff was skeptical, but Salvatore convinced her it would be fine because he was just a sidekick. She asked his name, and he replied Drizzt Do'Urden. <b>She</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> he could spell it, and he said [...] "not a chance". Recalling Drizzt's creation in an interview, Salvatore said, [...] "I don't know where it came from. I guess that Gary Gygax just did such an amazing job in creating the drow elves that something about them got stuck in the back of my head. Thank God!" [...] Although many readers have assumed that Drizzt is based on one of the many Dungeons & Dragons role-playing campaigns that the author has played, this is not the case. Salvatore's main influences were classical literature and works of J. R. R. Tolkien. [...] "I like to think of Drizzt as a cross between Daryth from Darkwalker on Moonshae and Aragorn from The Lord of the Rings." [...] Salvatore calls Drizzt [...] "the classic romantic hero—misunderstood, holding to a code of ideals even when the going gets tough, and getting no appreciation for it most of the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Kate Kane is {{featured}} in [...] She is heard on Bruce Wayne's answering machine, where <b>she</b> <b>asks</b> <b>if</b> {{he is coming}} to her marriage with Maggie Sawyer and mentions that he taught her the importance of keeping up appearances, hinting that she has already become Batwoman.|$|R
5000|$|A bit later, Winnie is {{sleeping}} {{when she hears}} a noise and gets scared when woken up. <b>She</b> <b>asks</b> <b>if</b> it's Jesse when it's actually Mae again. Mae says, [...] "No, he's asleep, but dreaming of you I bet." [...] Mae hums Hush, Little Baby to her.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "Three's a Crowd" [...] in Season 1, Carrie {{is talking to}} Big's ex-wife, Barbara, when <b>she</b> <b>asks</b> <b>if</b> Carrie is with anyone. Carrie avoids the {{question}} {{so as not to}} let Barbara know she's seeing him, therefore keeping Big's name a mystery.|$|R
2500|$|That {{evening after}} {{the success of}} the one-day boycott, a group of 16 to 18 people {{gathered}} at the Mt. Zion AME Zion Church to discuss boycott strategies. At that time Parks was introduced but not asked to speak, despite a standing ovation and calls from the crowd for her to speak; when <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> she should say something, the reply was, [...] "Why, you've said enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{attended}} a club venue in Carlton, the Love In, which had two singers and she thought: [...] "Oh my god, I can sing better than that". Her inspirations were Nina Simone, Bessie Smith, Aretha Franklin and Bob Dylan. The following {{week at the}} Love In <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> she could get up to sing, and promptly provided [...] "Bessie Smith songs and a Miriam Makeba song, 'When I've Passed on'". The management advised [...] "you can sing here every week".|$|E
2500|$|Notable {{performances}} {{at the festival}} included Muse's' headlining performance on the Saturday night, complete with the sensational sound and spectacular pyrotechnics that wowed Wembley Stadium earlier this summer, Daft Punk's light show on Stage 2/NME Stage on the Sunday night, The Killer's performance the same night, which featured an impressive visual spectacle, Scissor Sisters (at which frontman Jake Shears's drew attention to himself by stripping down to a towel and rolling around in the mud {{in front of the}} moshpit, after previously climbing the stage rigging), [...] a bewildered Lovefoxxx of CSS being corrected by the crowd after <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> they were in Dublin, as well as Bloc Party's rousing performance on the Sunday afternoon as frontman Kele Okereke leaped off the stage and called for the crowd to get [...] "violent". The Kooks followed Bloc Party by playing to a mud-soaked crowd, notable mainly for the chaotic mud slinging that saw a number of security personnel humbled by raucous festivalgoers (and slippery surfaces) ...|$|E

2500|$|Margaret {{was finally}} called on Thursday {{afternoon}} and she arrived the next morning. [...] However, Lukwiya's colleagues were strict in the protocols. [...] While {{she was forced}} to sit on a stool three feet away from his bed, she was eventually allowed to hold his foot through three layers of glove. [...] On Sunday, his breathing had become so laboured that he was put on a respirator. [...] By early Monday evening the oxygen level of his blood was rising and his pulse was near normal. [...] It appeared that he might pull through but later that evening Lukwiya's lungs began haemorrhaging, a worst-case scenario. [...] Lukwiya died at 1:20 am on Tuesday, 5 December 2000. [...] When Margaret was informed and came to the ward, the body had already been put into a polyethylene bag. [...] When <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> they could unzip it a little so she could have a last look, she was refused; the body was too infectious to take any risks.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{numerous}} {{reports in the}} media of Atta and Shehhi going to Shuckum's Oyster Pub and Seafood Grill, a sports bar in Hollywood, Florida, on September 8, 2001. Atta, Shehhi, and a third unidentified man reportedly drank heavily and played the Golden Tee '97 arcade game there. The bartender said [...] "Atta drank vodka and orange juice, while Shehhi preferred rum and cokes, five drinks apiece. They were wasted [...]" [...] Manager Tony Amos described, [...] "The guy Mohamed was drunk, his voice was slurred {{and he had a}} thick accent." [...] Bartender Patricia Idrissi said the men argued over the bill, and when <b>she</b> <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> there was a problem, [...] "Mohamed said he worked for American Airlines and he could pay his bill." [...] Atta said, [...] "I have plenty of money. I'm a pilot." [...] And he hauled a wad of $50 and $100 bills from his pocket, eventually leaving a $3 tip. However, Atta flew on US Airways Flight 2719 to Baltimore at approximately 3:15 p.m. on September 7 from Fort Lauderdale, and therefore could not have been at Shuckum's that evening. On September 8, Atta was in Laurel, Maryland, where he went to a Safeway grocery store to wire $2850 to Mustafa Muhammad Ahmad in Dubai, and sent another $5000 to Ahmed from a Giant Food store in Laurel on the same day. On September 9, Atta flew on to Boston.|$|E

5000|$|She is {{featured}} chowing down on Chicken of the Sea tuna—an {{allusion to the}} first episode, where <b>she</b> <b>asks</b> <b>if</b> the famous tuna brand is really chicken—and buffalo wings, a reference to another gaffe of hers, when <b>she</b> <b>asks</b> <b>if</b> buffalo wings come from buffalo. At one point she is sporting a T-shirt reading [...] "plata-ma-pus," [...] the way Jessica thought [...] "platypus" [...] was pronounced. She is shown around the house making haphazard attempts at housekeeping, another reference to the first episode, when then-husband Nick Lachey reproves her for not trying to do more around the house herself. In the video, she floods a sink with soapsuds and awkwardly tries to Swiffer the kitchen floor; a later scene shows her trying to sort dirty laundry. She is also seen golfing, another thing she has difficulty with on the show.|$|R
