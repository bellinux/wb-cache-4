40|$|Although the {{overwhelming}} majority of natural processes occurs far from the equilibrium, general theoretical approaches to non-equilibrium phase transitions remain scarce. Recent breakthroughs introducing description of open dissipative systems in terms of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics allowed to identify a class of non-equilibrium phase transitions associated with the loss of combined parity (reflection) and time-reversal symmetries. Here we report that time evolution of a single classical spin (e. g. monodomain ferromagnet) governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equation in absence of higher-order anisotropy terms is described by a Möbius transformation in complex <b>stereographic</b> <b>coordinates.</b> We identify the parity-time symmetry-breaking phase transition occurring in spin-transfer torque-driven linear spin systems as a transition between hyperbolic and loxodromic classes of Möbius transformations, with the critical point of the transition corresponding to the parabolic transformation. This establishes the understanding of non-equilibrium phase transitions as topological transitions in configuration space. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|E
40|$|Well-known {{methods for}} solving the shape-from-shading problem require {{knowledge}} of the reflectance map. Here we show how the shape-from-shading problem can be solved when the reflectance map is not available, but {{is known to have}} a given form with some unknown parameters. This happens, for example, when the surface is known to be Lambertian, but the direction to the light source is not known. We give an iterative algorithm that alternately estimates the surface shape and the light source direction. Use of the unit normal in parameterizing the reflectance map, rather than the gradient or <b>stereographic</b> <b>coordinates,</b> simpliflies the analysis. Our approach also leads to an iterative scheme for computing shape from shading that adjusts the current estimates of the focal normals toward or away {{from the direction of the}} light source. The amount of adjustment is proportional to the current difference between the predicted and the observed brightness. We also develop generalizations to less constrained forms of reflectance maps...|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{development}} of the Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system, several European nations demonstrated the utility of grid-based conformal maps by mapping their territory during the interwar period. Calculating the distance between two points on these maps could be performed more easily in the field (using the Pythagorean theorem) than was possible using the trigonometric formulas required under the graticule-based system of latitude and longitude. In the post-war years, these concepts were extended into the Universal Transverse Mercator/Universal Polar <b>Stereographic</b> (UTM/UPS) <b>coordinate</b> system, which is a global (or universal) system of grid-based maps.|$|R

40|$|Planar zeros are {{studied in}} the context of the five-point {{scattering}} amplitude for gauge bosons and gravitons. In the case of gauge theories, it is found that planar zeros are determined by an algebraic curve in the projective plane spanned by the three <b>stereographic</b> <b>coordinates</b> labelling the direction of the outgoing momenta. This curve depends on the values of six independent color structures. Considering the gauge group SU(N) with N= 2, 3, 5 and fixed color indices, the class of curves obtained gets broader by increasing the rank of the group. For the five-graviton scattering, on the other hand, we show that the amplitude vanishes whenever the process is planar, without imposing further kinematic conditions. A rationale for this result is provided using color-kinematics duality. Comment: 26 pages, 12 figures. v 2 : minor changes, typos corrected and reference added.

40|$|Knots {{and links}} are {{fascinating}} and intricate topological objects. Their influence spans from DNA and molecular chemistry to vortices in superfluid helium, defects in liquid crystals and cosmic strings {{in the early}} universe. Here, we find that knotted structures also exist in a peculiar class of three-dimensional topological insulators [...] -the Hopf insulators. In particular, we demonstrate that the momentum-space spin textures of Hopf insulators are twisted in a nontrivial way, which implies the presence of various knot and link structures. We further illustrate that the knots and nontrivial spin textures can be probed via standard time-of-flight images in cold atoms as preimage contours of spin orientations in <b>stereographic</b> <b>coordinates.</b> The extracted Hopf invariants, knots, and links are validated to be robust to typical experimental imperfections.

However the precise position and detailed feature of grounding line haven 2 ̆ 7 t decided because its positions difficult to find from surface of ice sheet. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a microwave imaging sensor and SAR sensor illuminate microwave to the ground, then observe its backscattered microwave from ground, interferometric SAR (InSAR) is an application technique of SAR data to measure the line-of-sight distance change using a pair of SAR data and most suitable technique for the detection of grounding line because InSAR can detect the tidal motion of ice shelf.

40|$|The {{characteristic}} {{approach to}} numerical relativity {{is a useful}} tool in evolving gravitational systems. In the past this has been implemented using two patches of <b>stereographic</b> angular <b>coordinates.</b> In other applications, a six-patch angular coordinate system has proved effective. Here we investigate {{the use of a}} six-patch system in characteristic numerical relativity, by comparing an existing two-patch implementation (using second-order finite differencing throughout) with a new six-patch implementation (using either second- or fourth-order finite differencing for the angular derivatives). We compare these different codes by monitoring the Einstein constraint equations, numerically evaluated independently from the evolution. We find that, compared to the (second-order) two-patch code at equivalent resolutions, the errors of the second-order six-patch code are smaller by a factor of about 2, and the errors of the fourth-order six-patch code are smaller by a factor of nearly 50.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{projective}} properties of planar zeros of tree-level scattering amplitudes in various theories. Whereas for pure scalar field theories {{we find that}} the planar zeros of the five-point amplitude do not enjoy projective invariance, coupling scalars to gauge fields gives rise to tree-level amplitudes whose planar zeros are determined by homogeneous polynomials in the <b>stereographic</b> <b>coordinates</b> labelling the direction of flight of the outgoing particles. In the case of pure gauge theories, this projective structure is generically destroyed if string corrections are taken into account. Scattering amplitudes of two scalars with graviton emission vanish exactly in the planar limit, whereas planar graviton amplitudes are zero for helicity violating configurations. These results are corrected by string effects, computed using the single-valued projection, which render the planar amplitude nonzero. Finally, we discuss how the structure of planar zeros can be derived from the soft limit behavior of the scattering amplitudes. Comment: 39 page, 5 figures. v 2 : typos corrected.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 42 - 44) Over {{the past}} few years, it has been shown, through theory and experiments, that the AC current produced by spin torque nano-oscillators (STNO), coupled in an array, can lead to feedback between the STNOs causing them to synchronize. Once synchronized the microwave power output of an array is significantly larger than that of an individual valve. It has also been observed that in coupling STNOs into arrays, the region of parameter space that corresponds to synchronization between the individual oscillators tends to shrink. In order to explore the parameter space and find regions of synchronization, Complex <b>Stereographic</b> <b>coordinates</b> for the governing equations are employed, reducing the dimensions of a single STNO from three dimensions to two. Then, numerical computations are used to explore {{the dynamics of the}} coupled arrays of STNOs and to generate bifurcation diagrams for locating regions of synchronization. Once these regions are discovered, the Transverse Lyapunov Exponents of the synchronized system are calculated to determine whether the synchronization between the oscillators is stable.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 44 - 47) Since {{the discovery}} of Giant Magnetoresistance in the late 80 s, Spintronics has become an emerging field of electronics. One critical component to modern day wireless communications is the microwave voltage oscillator. This work explores the use of Spin Torque Nano Oscillators (STNOs) to produce a spintronics voltage oscillator in the microwave range. STNOs are quite small [...] {{on the order of}} 10 nm [...] and frequency agile. However, experimental results to date have produced power outputs that are too small to be useful. To increase power output, we investigate systems of coupled STNOs. Numerical simulations indicate that n synchronized STNOs configured in series or parallel produce n 2 -times as much power as n uncoupled STNOs. However as the number of oscillators n increases, the regions of parameter space corresponding to synchronization tend to shrink. To set the foundation for further analysis, we consider both Spherical and Complex <b>Stereographic</b> <b>coordinates</b> for the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert Equation with spin torque term. Both coordinate systems effectively reduce the equation of a single STNO from a three dimensions to two. Further, the Complex Stereographic representation transforms the equation into a nearly polynomial form that may prove useful for advanced dynamics analysis.
