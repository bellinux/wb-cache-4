40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of four self-contained essays on different conflicts shaping local government policy. The first essay examines how population aging affects the generosity of public long-term care. Aging may directly affect long-term care policy as the elderly become a more important voter group. However, concerns for other citizens may dampen the political importance of the elderly. Fixed effects regressions on municipality-level panel data for 1999 - 2007 suggest that long-term care generosity slightly decreases {{in response to an}} aging population. In particular, a smaller share of elderly become entitled to long-term care. The remaining three essays consider determinants of local fiscal performance. The second essay examines a case in which the Swedish central government granted financial assistance to 36 municipalities in financial trouble. The possibility to be bailed out by the central government is often argued to undermine local governments' incentives for fiscal discipline. However, the conditions attached to the grant under study may have reduced the attractiveness of the bailout option. We estimate fixed effects models of operating costs and net revenues during the decade following the announcement of the grant. The estimation sample {{consists of}} the municipalities affected by the program and suitable comparison units identified by the synthetic control method. The estimates suggest that the development of operating costs is largely unaffected by the program for most of the admitted municipalities. However, several have increased costs less than expected, and the development of net revenues is favorable for the group as a whole. Thus, we find little evidence that participation in this conditional bailout program undermined subsequent fiscal performance. The third essay examines how fiscal performance is affected by specific institutions aimed at encouraging the budget discipline of agents responsible for policy implementation. We emphasize that these institutions should be of greater importance in municipalities where there is a substantial conflict of interest between the two levels of the municipal hierarchy concerning the importance of fiscal discipline. Regressions on unique survey data from 265 of the 290 Swedish municipalities confirm that the correlation between institutions and fiscal performance depend on the reported strength of conflict between the two levels. A centralized budget process, a credible threat of replacement of managers running deficits, and <b>surplus</b> <b>carry-over</b> rules are all positively correlated to net revenues - but only in municipalities that report substantial conflicts of interest between the two hierarchical levels. However, a deficit carry-over rule is positively correlated to net revenues in municipalities reporting minor conflicts of interest. The fourth essay explores potential determinants of the conflicts of interest reported in the survey. The main findings are that (i) conflicts between the two hierarchical levels are less likely if members of the executive committee chair the local committees; (ii) conflicts are less common in municipalities with fewer committees; and (iii) conflicts are more likely in municipalities with recent experience of deteriorations of the general economic conditions. The first two findings suggest that the center of the municipal hierarchy may use its discretion over appointments and over the number of committees to resolve these conflicts of interests in some instances. However, as the general economic environment is beyond political control, it is difficult to fully prevent conflicts between the central and local level...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of an introduction and four self-contained chapters that address issues of how organizations and institutions should be designed {{in order to provide}} adequate incentives and enable coordination. The first essay uses a multi-task principal-agent model to examine two reasons why coordination problems are common when public sector organizations share responsibilities: the incentives to coordinate resource allocation and the difficulties of measuring performance. When targets are set individually, the resulting incentives may induce inefficient resource allocations, even if agents' motivation is fully in line with the principal's interests, and performance measures are perfect. Introducing shared targets may improve the incentives to coordinate, especially when agents are highly motivated by activities for which responsibility is not shared, performance measures overestimate the value of these activities, and the imprecision of performance measures is low. Simulations indicate that the one-shot model is a good approximation in the short run when one parameter is initially unknown, but imprecise measures yield substantial deviations from equilibrium when three parameters have to be learned. The second essay develops a model of costly communication with the weakest-link game as a basis, and boundedly rational agents that choose myopic best replies, have limited information processing capabilities, and may occasionally experiment or make mistakes. Communication may increase efficiency, but as agents face a trade-off between lowering the strategic uncertainty for the group and the costs of communication, the least efficient state is often the unique stochastically stable state. Making communication mandatory on the other hand induces efficient coordination, whereas letting a team leader handle the communication increases efficiency when the leader expects others to follow and has enough authority over the group. Simulations show that the stochastically stable state is also overrepresented in the short run, especially if groups are large. The third essay examines theoretically and empirically the relationship between budget institutions and fiscal performance in local governments. The model suggests that conflicts of interest over fiscal discipline between the central and the local levels imply that the central level needs institutions that curb the bargaining power and align the incentives of the local levels. A survey covering 265 out of 290 Swedish municipalities is used to collect information on conflicts of interests and budget institutions. The regression results indicate that interactions between institutions and conflicts of interest are important, as the estimated correlations depend on the strength of conflicts. Centralization of the budget process, a credible threat of replacement of managers following systematic deficits, and <b>surplus</b> <b>carry-over</b> rules all appear beneficial to net revenues, but only in municipalities that report substantial conflicts of interest. For municipalities where the conflict is small, a deficit carry-over rule is positively correlated to net revenues. The fourth essay examines a case in which the Swedish central government provided conditional grants to 36 financially troubled municipalities. The synthetic control method is used to identify suitable comparison units for each of the 36 municipalities. The estimates of fixed effects regressions on the resulting sample indicate that for most of the admitted municipalities, costs seem to be largely unaffected by the program. However, a non-negligible share is able to hold back costs more than expected, and the development of net revenues is favorable for the group as a whole. Thus, participation in a conditional bailout program need not erode fiscal discipline, and may even induce a greater concern for fiscal discipline...|$|E
