40|$|National audienceThe "academic" {{method of}} {{manufacturing}} dimensions determination through the decomposition of the manufacturing plan into several steps, each one corresponding to a part holder, is not usable when the part is produced by only one machine, like {{in the case of}} <b>screw</b> <b>machining.</b> The transfer of the condition dimensions in manufacturing dimensions is therefore not always direct because the setup operator might also want to control the position of the unfinished surfaces during the adjustment of the machine. This results in introducing intermediate control steps into the manufacturing plan. In this case and for some condition dimensions, several chains of dimensions are possible, thus several manufacturing dimension systems are possible...|$|E

50|$|With {{the advent}} of NC, <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> diverged into two classes, {{mechanical}} and NC. This distinction continues today with mechanical <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> and CNC <b>screw</b> <b>machines.</b> However, in shop-floor jargon, the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> by itself is still often understood in context to imply a mechanical <b>screw</b> <b>machine,</b> so the retronym mechanical <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> is not consistently used.|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} {{discusses}} {{the surface finish}} of several common die materials, of which the screw-surface is finished by compound processes of electrochemical finishing and burnishing. The burnishing-tool uses ceramic material connected with the electrode and moves, following the electrode, to burnish the workpiece. In the experiment, the electrode is used with a continuous and pulsed direct current. The {{results show that the}} use of a higher rotational speed for the electrode and burnishing-tool is advantageous to the finish. A partial form with a thinner heavy section performs the best finish effect in the current investigation. Pulsed direct current can slightly improve the finish effect. The burnishing process can increase the finish effect. An effective and low-cost finish processes through burnishing assistance following electrochemical finishing after <b>screw</b> <b>machining</b> offers a fast improvement for the surface roughness of the screw-surface and is a new application in the screw finishing process. 1...|$|E
5000|$|The {{definition}} of the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> has changed with changing technology. Any use of the term prior to the 1840s, if it occurred, would have referred ad hoc to any machine tool used to produce screws, that is, {{there would have been no}} established differentiation from the term screw-cutting lathe. When turret lathes were developed in the 1840s, the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> was applied to them in overlapping usage with the term turret lathe. In 1860, when some of the movements, such as turret indexing, were mechanically automated, the term automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> was applied, and the term hand <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> or manual <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> was retronymously applied to the earlier machines. Within 15 years, the entire part-cutting cycle had been mechanically automated, and machines of the 1860 type were retronymously called semi-automatic. From that time on, machines with fully automated cycles were usually called automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machines,</b> and eventually, in the usage of most people in the machining industries, the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> no longer was used to refer to manual or semi-automatic turret lathes, having become reserved for one class of machine, the fully mechanically automated type. This narrow meaning of <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> remained stable from about the 1890s until the 1950s. (Brown & Sharpe continued to call some of their hand-operated turret lathe models [...] "screw machines", but most machinists reserved the term for automatics.) Within this class called <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> there were variations, such as single-spindle versus multispindle, horizontal-turret versus vertical-turret, etc.|$|R

The smaller types are usually called <b>screw</b> <b>machines,</b> while the larger variants are usually called automatic chucking machines, automatic chuckers, or simply chuckers. <b>Screw</b> <b>machines</b> usually work from bar stock, while chuckers automatically chuck up individual blanks from a magazine. Typical minimum profitable production lot size on a <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> is in the thousands of parts due to the large setup time. Once set up, a <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> can rapidly and efficiently produce thousands of parts on a continuous basis with high accuracy, low cycle time, and very little human intervention. (The latter two points drive down the unit cost per interchangeable part much lower than could be achieved without these machines.) ...|$|R

40|$|Synchronous Motor (PMSM) is an {{important}} process in industries, especially in the hard disk drive assembly processes. For example, the automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> is one of important machines in the hard disk drive assembly processes. The PMSM is a fundamental component of the automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machine.</b> The feedback torque control system use estimated torque received from motor current. The disturbance torque caused by the screw process depends {{on the quality of}} the screw heads and screw holes. The automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> requires precise output torque because the error of output torque affects the automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machine</b> performance. The damage in the hard disk drive assembly process may result from an inaccurate output torque. For instance, the defect of product is broken threads of the screws and the out of length of the screw heads. When the control process requires precision output torque, the machines must be calibrated by operator with standard value consumed 20 - 30 minutes per machine. This paper presents a torque control system with an adaptive fuzzy logic compensator for torque control and torque estimation simultaneously. The method of the research can increase the efficiency of torque control system and decrease the calibration time of the automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machines.</b> Index Terms—Permanent magnet synchronous motor, control theory, observer and adaptive fuzzy logic compensator.

50|$|Speaking with {{reference}} to the normal definition of the term <b>screw</b> <b>machine,</b> all <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> are fully automated, whether mechanically (via cams) or by CNC (computerized control), which means that once they are set up and started running, they continue running and producing parts with very little human intervention. This has been true since the 1870s. Mechanical automation came first, beginning in the 1870s; computerized control (via first NC and then CNC) came later, beginning in the 1950s.|$|R
5000|$|Small- to {{medium-sized}} cam-operated {{automatic lathes}} were (and still are) usually called <b>screw</b> <b>machines</b> or automatic <b>screw</b> <b>machines.</b> These machines work on parts that (as a rough guide only) are usually less than 80 mm {{in diameter and}} less than 300 mm long. <b>Screw</b> <b>machines</b> almost invariably do bar work, which means that an entire length of bar stock (anywhere from 1 to 4 m in length) passes through the spindle and is gripped by the chuck (which is usually a collet chuck). As the part is being machined, {{the entire length of}} bar stock is turning with the spindle. When the part is done, it is [...] "parted off" [...] from the bar, the chuck un-clamps, the bar is fed forward, and the chuck then closes again, ready for the next cycle. The bar-feeding can happen by various means, including pulling-finger tools that grab the bar and pull or roller bar feed that pushes the bar from behind.|$|R
