5|$|As {{a result}} of Mugford's {{statement}} Bamber was arrested on 8 September 1985, as was the friend Mugford <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> implicated, although the latter had a solid alibi and was released. Bamber told police Mugford was lying because he had jilted her. He said he loved his parents and sister, and denied that they had kept him short of money; he said {{the only reason he}} had broken into the caravan site with Mugford was to prove that security was poor. He <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> occasionally gained entry to the farmhouse through a downstairs windows, and had used a knife to move the catches from the outside. He also <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> seen his parents' wills, and that they had left the estate to be shared between him and Sheila.

In another statement, Krasniansky <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> passed it to Kastner on 28 April in Bratislava, but Hansi Brand, Kastner's lover and the wife of Joel Brand, said that Kastner was not in Bratislava until August. It is clear from Kastner's post-war statements that he did have early access to the report, Bauer writes, but perhaps not in April. According to Randolph L.
