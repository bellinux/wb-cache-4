40|$|Page(s) : 4 (1), 14 - 26, 16 Ref. Grain losses {{resulting}} {{from the use of}} two guar mechanical harvesting methods, viz. direct combining and windrow combining, were evaluated over two seasons (1992 / 93 and 1993 / 94). Net and gross yields, harvest losses (preharvest, gathering, total discharge and total losses) as well as impurities in grain tank were determined and analysed. Harvest methods had a significant effect on gathering, walker and total losses, net yield and impurities in both seasons, as well as <b>shoe</b> <b>losses</b> and gross yield in the first season and total discharge losses in the second season. Gathering losses and impurities were highly significant in windrow combining, thus markedly reducing both quantity and quality. Total discharge loss and its components were slightly greater in direct combining but none of them exceeded the acceptable limit of 1 % of gross yield. Khartoum University Pres...|$|E

40|$|Reduction in {{grain loss}} of combine {{harvesters}} {{will increase the}} efficiency of harvesters and the net income of the farmer. Grain lost in the field may emerge as a weed in the crop rotation and harbor unwanted insects;A simulation model was developed for calculating the various components of loss and yield in the combine. Forward speed was determined for each day of operation. Yield, total area harvested, and losses were also calculated;Transducers were designed for measuring yield, walker <b>loss,</b> <b>shoe</b> <b>loss</b> and forward speed of a combine and {{a model of the}} combine was constructed in the laboratory for evaluating these transducers.

40|$|Suburban {{and rural}} horse farms can suffer from {{problems}} created by mud {{in areas of}} concentrated horse traffic. Because of the frequent trampling of wet ground, mud usually occurs at key locations on the farm—gates, loafing and feeding areas, and watering areas. Once mud appears, {{it is difficult to}} remediate, and the problem recurs with each rain. Depending on the enterprise, cost-share programs may be available that can offset the expense of installing high traffic pads. Excessively muddy conditions impact the health and well being of horses by creating a soft surface that makes walking and standing difficult. Extremely muddy areas may increase <b>shoe</b> <b>loss</b> for shod horses. Mud can harbor pests such as flies and mosquitoes as well as pathogens that may cause infection. Muddy areas can be dangerous and expensive for the horse owner as well. Such areas can become slippery and increase chances of falls and injuries. When the mud dries, the soil becomes compacted, prohibiting vegetation growth and creating an area with reduced infiltration and increased surface water runoff. Air spaces in the soil are removed, which reduces the insulation value of the soil and can cause water lines near livestock waterers to freeze. Exposed soil has a negative effect on water quality. The lack of vegetation allows nutrients, sediment, and possibly pathogens to be carried in runoff and discharged to surfac...|$|R

Two studies were conducted to determine the effects on the spinal column, flexibility and the level of discomfort people experience as a result of standing using Converse[] All-Star athletic shoes on six different industrial floor surfaces and four different foot conditions for periods of four hours on four consecutive days. The floor surfaces used included two types of anti-fatigue mats (Hygenic 1, Ergomat), three types of industrial grating (Metal Grating, Clean Room Grating, Standard Clean Room floor) and concrete. The foot conditions on concrete used included Converses All-Star athletic shoes, Dr. Scholl[] shoe inserts inside Converse[] All-Star athletic shoes, Converse[] All-Star athletic shoes with a footrail, and Reebok[] walking shoes. Spinal contour and flexibility was measured before and after each trial, as well as subjective ratings. Although there was no statistical significance for the floor surface or foot condition with regard to flexibility, the greatest loss of flexibility occurred with concrete and the least loss of flexibility occurred with Hygenic 1 for the floor surface study. For foot conditions, the participants lost the most flexibility with Converse[] All-Star athletic shoes with Dr. Scholl[] shoe inserts followed by Converse[] All-Star athletic shoes and then Reebok[] walking <b>shoes.</b> The least <b>loss</b> of flexibility occurred with the Converse[] All-Star athletic shoes with a footrail. Males, overall, lost more flexibility than females. This apparent loss in flexibility and lack of significant change in the other dependent variables suggests the muscles tense to maintain the proper curvature in the spinal column when undergoing stress. In the subjective discomfort analysis, no significant difference was found for either floor surface or foot condition. Across floor surfaces, significance resulted between gender in the neck, shoulders, upper back, lower back, thigh, knees, legs, and feet. Females generally reported experiencing more discomfort than males as a result of standing. The participants ranked the anti-fatigue mats as the most comfortable floor surface and ranked the use of a footrail and Reebok walking shoes as the most comfortable foot conditions...|$|R
30|$|Analyses will be {{performed}} using commercially available software (IBM SPSS Statistics 23, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). All data derived from the statistical methods will be given in mean ± standard deviation. Research shows that the most successful athletes in marathon and ultra-marathon running events are frequently those who lose substantially more than 3 – 4  % BW during competition (Zouhal et al. 2011). Mean body weight of male recreational marathon runners is 73.9  ±  8.1  kg (Barandun et al. 2012) and 75.8  ±  8.6  kg (Friedrich et al. 2014) of male recreational half marathon runners. Mean body weight of female recreational runners is 59.1  ±  6.3  kg (Rüst et al. 2013) and 60.1  ±  7.8  kg (Friedrich et al. 2014) of female recreational half marathon runners. Expected body weight loss during a marathon race is 2.3  ±  2.2  % overall (Zouhal et al. 2011). For male recreational marathon runners we expect a 2.3  % weight loss from 73.9 to 72.2  kg, therefore a sample size of 179 runners is needed to reach 80  % power with two-sided test and alpha of 0.05. For female recreational marathon runners we expect a 2.3  % weight loss from 59.1 to 57.7  kg, therefore a sample size of 159 runners is needed to reach 80  % power with two-sided test and alpha of 0.05. Since body weight loss during a marathon is inversely related to race finishing time (Zouhal et al. 2011) we expect the fastest runners to lose the most relative body weight during competition. Multi-variant regression analyses will be used the determine effects of kind of diet, sex, age, BMI, finished running distances, years of race experience, weekly training load, weekly training frequency, training intensity, in-race food and fluid consumption on individual finishing time (% of overall winners time, ranking, calculated pace). An analysis of variance will {{be performed}} to compare individual finishing time (% of overall winners time, ranking, calculated pace), sex, age, body weight, height, BMI, attended running events in past 2  years, finished running distances, personal best time on each distance, number of planned events for 2014 / 2015, daily/weekly training frequency, daily/weekly training load, period of preparation for main event, aim of race participation, years of running experience, motivation for running then and now, assisted training, years of race experience, training intensity, medium/long-term goal of racing, additional specific kinds of training, specific diet including supplements, specific training/diet prior to race, diet on day of rest/training/race, pre/in/post-race diet, in-race food and fluid consumption, specific gear, relevant medical measures, pre/post-race body weight (including clothing and <b>shoes),</b> calculated weight <b>loss,</b> in-race: nutritional strategy during race, fluid and nutrient intake including breakfast, mood status, and RPE (Borg) whole body/respiratory/legs, among the three subgroups created respective to diet.|$|R
40|$|People lead storied {{lives and}} {{narrative}} inquiry {{makes sense of}} human experience through analyzing stories told. Personal accounts of episodes and events include narrative devices, like metaphors, which help us understand how individuals interpret and apply meaning to their experiences. This study explored how descriptions of emotional and physical adjustments to living with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) serve as metaphors {{for the impact of}} RA on identity. A secondary analysis of two qualitative studies was undertaken using a narrative approach. Study one explored the impact of RA on the role of mother in 12 women; study two explored the help-seeking process in 37 women diagnosed with RA in the year prior to recruitment. During the original data analysis for both studies, narrative devices were observed in descriptions of daily life experiences that had been disrupted by RA, and this prompted the present analysis. All 49 transcripts were reviewed and metaphorical descriptions of how RA experiences shaped sense of self or identity were extracted. Representative metaphors were then written by research team members, supported by verbatim passages from transcripts, and revised until consensus achieved by the team as a whole. A number of metaphors illustrated the process of adapting to RA, characterized by adjustments to daily routines from the most basic self care to participation in valued life roles. A powerful example is “changing shoes. ” This metaphor arises from descriptions of actual events where women could no longer wear the shoes that reflected their style, preference, or life roles. Underlying the seemingly superficial <b>loss</b> of favored <b>shoes</b> was a <b>loss</b> of self – a professional self, a country-club self, a stylish self. “Changing shoes” metaphorically describes a shift in identity from a healthy person to one living with chronic illness and the new work that entails. The things women did to accommodate arthritis, either on their own or on the advice of a health professional, are shown through narrative analysis to represent emotional and physical adaptation to everyday activities that are meaningful to each individual. Metaphors were observed to exemplify key concepts advancing occupational science, such as the central role of occupation to shaping identity. In the example presented here, changing shoes represents not only a physical adjustment to accommodate pain, but is also part of an internal process of reshaping identity. Appreciating how small changes carry greater meaning with regard to one’s identity may foster more effective patient-provider communication and client-centered practice. Discussion Questions: We’ve found that “shoes” resonate with many people as a symbol of occupation and identity. What are some explanations for this being a strong symbol? Can you think of other metaphors for concepts, like occupational identity, that are important to building occupational science...|$|R
