5|$|The {{watershed}} {{is covered}} predominantly by temperate coniferous forest, which makes up approximately 64 {{percent of the}} total area. The primary species in these areas are Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, madrone, and incense-cedar. Buckbrush and manzanita grow in the drier chaparral regions. Several rare plants including Gentner's fritillary, oblongleaf stonecrop, Siskiyou lewisia, clustered lady's slipper, and splithair Indian paintbrush also grow in the watershed. Seven species of noxious weeds have been identified: three species of thistles, medusahead rye, <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom,</b> St. Johns wort, and tansy ragwort.|$|E
5|$|The Chetco River {{watershed}} {{is covered}} primarily by temperate coniferous forest, which includes {{species such as}} Douglas fir, western hemlock, white fir, Port Orford cedar, California incense cedar, and Sitka spruce. Jeffrey pine, knobcone pine, and golden chinquapin have also been identified. Hardwoods including tanoak, bigleaf maple, red alder, and Pacific madrone are common. Manzanita, hazelnut, vine maple, western skunk cabbage, and multiple species of berries and grasses make up the understory. Kalmiopsis, a flowering evergreen shrub and the namesake of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, only grows in the Siskiyou Mountains. Several noxious weeds have also been identified, including gorse, <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom,</b> blackberries, and thistles.|$|E

25|$|Invasive {{species have}} become a concern in some areas. Some of these include yellow starthistle and <b>scotch</b> <b>broom.</b> Starthistle has become {{a problem in the}} Siskiyous only in the last 20 years. It has little value to habitat and is able to outcompete many native plants. Purple loosestrife is a plant that is {{invasive}} to waterways.|$|E
25|$|Hemp, {{because of}} its height, dense foliage and its high {{planting}} density as a crop, is a very effective and long used method of killing tough weeds in farming by minimizing the pool of weed seeds of the soil. Using hemp this way can help farmers avoid the use of herbicides, to help gain organic certification and to gain the benefits of crop rotation. Due to its rapid, dense growth characteristics, in some jurisdictions hemp is considered a prohibited noxious weed, much like <b>Scotch</b> <b>Broom.</b>|$|E
25|$|As of 2010, {{more than}} 185 bird {{species have been}} {{recorded}} in the refuge including herons, egrets, hawks, osprey, shorebirds, gulls, terns, hummingbirds, woodpeckers, grebes, falcons, vultures, waterfowl, and many others. Vegetation, which varies {{from one part of}} the refuge to another, includes Oregon white oak, Pacific madrone, ash, and black locust trees; ferns, Oregon-grape, <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom,</b> and poison oak, as well as rushes, sedges, and other plants. Invasive species, gradually being replaced by physical removal and burning, include reed canary grass, purple loosestrife, Himalayan blackberry, and others.|$|E
500|$|A diverse {{number of}} plant species {{reside in the}} {{watershed}} as well. Red, white, and black spruce, red maple, white birch, and trembling aspen are the most common. Jack pine is commonly found in regions that fires have repeatedly ravished, while cedar is found in bogs and areas where gypsum and limestone are present. Higher altitude slopes and ridgetops house sugar maple, beech, and yellow birch trees. Zelazny et al. note that [...] " [...] high frequency of disturbed sites dominated by aspen stands reveals the degree of historical and recent human disturbance along the Petitcodiac River." [...] The Petitcodiac River's riparian zone houses a number of trees, including willows, white spruce, white pine, and speckled alder. Other trees, such as the tamarack and white pine, {{can also be found}} in the watershed. Plants such as the rufous bulrush tend to grow near calcareous areas, and hemlock can be found in small, pure stands. Alien plant species include the mother-of-thyme, the Japanese barberry, the <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom,</b> the yellow flag, and Canada bluegrass.|$|E
500|$|Across its range, the yellow-faced honeyeater {{is found}} {{in a range of}} habitatsâ€”in open sclerophyll forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude subalpine areas, and often in {{riparian}} woodlands. [...] It most commonly dwells in open forests dominated by spotted gum (Corymbia maculata) with ironbarks and stringybarks such as narrow-leaved ironbark (Eucalyptus crebra) and silver-leaved ironbark (E. melanophloia), with a light shrubby understorey, and less often in dry open forests and woodlands dominated by Angophora, Acacia, Banksia, Casuarina or Callitris, or in high-altitude, tall, open forests of alpine ash (Eucalyptus delegatensis) and woodlands dominated by snow gum (E. pauciflora) or white box (E. albens). It has been recorded in coastal heath when banksias are blooming, and among flowering mangroves. It occupies areas infested with weeds such as <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom</b> (Cytisus scoparius) and blackberries, and developed areas including orchards and parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers. It can be found in forests regenerating after fire or logging, though it is more common in mature forests. Where it {{is found in}} woodland, it is usually woodland near forest or with an understory of sclerophyll plants.|$|E
2500|$|The {{riparian}} forest along Boeing Creek in Boeing Creek Park is an intact native ecosystem, mostly free of invasive species. There {{are a number}} of mature conifers that escaped being logged, including [...] tall Douglas-fir and Western White Pine trees. Salmonberry shrubs are common along the creek. In some areas invasive species such as <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom,</b> Himalayan blackberry, English ivy, and Herb Robert are present. The native species of Sword fern and Stinging nettle are common.|$|E
2500|$|Much of Boeing Creek's upper course, to Hidden Lake, {{is within}} Boeing Creek Park, the {{northern}} part of Shoreview Park. Run by the City of Shoreline, these parks together span [...] William Boeing transferred the land that is now Shoreview Park to the Shoreline School District. In the mid-1970s land was cleared south of Hidden Lake for the construction of Shoreview High School. Funding failed and the school was never built. The cleared and terraced site has become infested with invasive species such as <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom</b> and Himalayan blackberry. In 1977 King County purchased the land from the Shoreline School District and established Shoreview Park. The City of Shoreline assumed ownership of Shoreview Park and adjoining Boeing Creek Park in 1997. Trails in these parks allow access to the middle portion of Boeing Creek. A few trails are official and maintained, including one that runs along the creek to Hidden Lake. There are a large number of [...] "social trails" [...] as well, which often climb steep, unstable slopes, increasing erosion and overall stream degradation. Every part of the creek is accessible, but the lake has some parts where it's not. There are people living along the lake in houses, and so that part is theirs.|$|E
50|$|Leucoptera spartifoliella is {{a species}} of moth in family Lyonetiidae known by the common name <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom</b> twig miner. It is used {{as an agent of}} {{biological}} pest control against the noxious weed known as <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom</b> (Cytisus scoparius).|$|E
50|$|Bruchidius villosus is {{a species}} of bean weevil known by the common names broom seed beetle and <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom</b> bruchid. This beetle is used {{as an agent of}} {{biological}} pest control against the noxious weed known as <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom</b> (Cytisus scoparius).|$|E
50|$|Exapion fuscirostre (formerly Apion fuscirostre) is {{a species}} of straight-snouted weevil known by the general common name <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom</b> seed weevil.

50|$|Cytisus scoparius, {{the common}} broom or <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom,</b> syn. Sarothamnus scoparius, is a {{perennial}} leguminous shrub native to western and central Europe. In Britain and Ireland, the standard name is broom, but this name {{is also used}} for {{other members of the}} Genisteae tribe, such as French broom or Spanish broom, and the term common broom is sometimes used for clarification. In other English-speaking countries, the most prevalent common name is <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom</b> (or Scot's broom); English broom is also occasionally used.|$|E
50|$|The moth was {{introduced}} to California {{for the purpose of}} controlling <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom</b> in 1960. It is now established in parts of the western United States. It {{was introduced}} to Australia in 1990. It {{may or may not be}} a worthwhile biocontrol agent; while the insect does do considerable damage to the plants, they can often recover. Much of the plant deaths occur when insect damage makes the plant susceptible to disease. Research is now focused on other agents of biocontrol for <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some Fabaceae, such as <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom</b> {{and other}} Genisteae, are leguminous but {{are usually not}} called legumes by farmers, who tend to {{restrict}} that term to food crops.|$|E
50|$|Shoreview Park {{habitats}} are Conifer-deciduous forest, Conifer-madrone forest, Grassland, Shrubland {{and developed}} areas.

50|$|This weevil is {{native to}} Europe. It has been {{released}} in the western United States where it has shown promise as a biocontrol agent for <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom.</b> It is now widespread in the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
50|$|New Zealand broom is not {{closely related}} to the European species Cytisus scoparius, common broom, which has been {{introduced}} to New Zealand, where it is commonly known as <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom</b> and is classed as a noxious weed because of its invasiveness.|$|E
50|$|Tillamook County {{transferred}} {{the land to}} the State of Oregon for a park in the 1930s. During the 1940s and 1950s, workers planted European beach grass, shore pine, and <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom</b> to stabilize the dunesâ€”a process that took an additional twenty years. The park opened in 1972.|$|E
50|$|The {{adult is}} a tiny white moth about four {{millimeters}} long. It lays eggs {{one at a time}} on the stem of <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom,</b> its host plant. The larva burrows throughout the epidermis of the stem for nearly a year before it pupates, causing damage to the plant.|$|E
50|$|Native {{plants are}} {{species of the}} California {{chaparral}} and woodlands and riparian forest habitats. Invasive plant species such as Giant reed (Arundo donax), <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom</b> (Cytisus scoparius), Yellow star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis), Himalayan blackberry (Rubus discolor) and many others are established along riparian zone sections of Pinole Creek.|$|E
5000|$|Plants {{containing}} cytisine, {{including the}} <b>scotch</b> <b>broom</b> and mescalbean, {{have also been}} used recreationally.

50|$|Fort Lewis' {{terrain is}} {{primarily}} a mixture of dense conifer woods and open Puget prairie-garry oak woodlands. Invasive <b>Scotch</b> <b>Broom</b> has taken over many areas. The landscape is very rocky from glacial meltwater deposits. Poison oak {{is found in the}} training areas. Canada Thistle grows thickly in some areas. All trees are to be left standing; post policy prohibits cutting or trimming them.|$|E
50|$|Common {{plants that}} have been {{introduced}} to the state include the eucalyptus, acacia, pepper tree, geranium, and <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom.</b> The species that are federally classified as endangered are the Contra Costa wallflower, Antioch Dunes evening primrose, Solano grass, San Clemente Island larkspur, salt marsh bird's beak, McDonald's rock-cress, and Santa Barbara Island liveforever. , 85 plant species were listed as threatened or endangered.|$|E
50|$|Many {{non-native}} plants also occur, {{including many}} invasive {{species such as}} English ivy, <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom,</b> laurel-leafed daphne, Himalayan blackberry, chicory, Queen Anne's lace, and red clover. Long-established exotic trees include London plane, horsechestnut, flowering cherry, flowering plum, Norway maple, sycamore maple, Japanese maple, catalpa and tulip tree. In recent years the American sweetgum, Freeman maple and Chinese windmill palm have become very popular.|$|E
50|$|Much of the Nilgiris' natural montane grasslands and shrublands {{interspersed}} with sholas {{has been much}} disturbed or destroyed by extensive tea plantations, easy motor-vehicle access, extensive commercial planting and harvesting of non-native eucalyptus and wattle (Acacia dealbata, Acacia mearnsii) plantations, and cattle grazing. The area also features one large and several smaller hydro-electric impoundments. <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom</b> has become an ecologically damaging invasive species.|$|E
50|$|Other notable {{species in}} the park, {{of the more than}} 875 {{indigenous}} to the DoÃ±ana ecosystems are: oleander, oak, the sea wallflower, sweet saltwort, the prickly tumbleweed, marram grass, heather, camarina, lavender, sea holly, reed, carnation, bulrush, common fern, sage-leaved rock rose, rushes, labiÃ©rnago (Phillyrea angustifolia), sea spurge, mastic, sedge, palm, pine, <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom,</b> rosemary, juniper, gorse, thyme, spurge and blackberries.|$|E
50|$|Other {{restoration}} {{work has}} been the removal of invasive plant species including star thistle, <b>scotch</b> <b>broom</b> and Himalayan blackberry. Non-native plants can displace the native species, which may decrease biodiversity and cause a loss of habitat that provide nest sites and food sources. The riparian or streamside plant areas along Butte Creek are the most vulnerable to invasive non-native plants.|$|E
5000|$|At this time, the Puget blue has not {{yet been}} {{designated}} endangered or threatened by the federal government, but it is a candidate species for restoration in the state of Washington. Populations in the prairies have declined due to the loss of prairies as well as the encroachment of woody vegetation such as Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and <b>Scotch</b> <b>broom</b> (Cytisus scoparius).|$|E
50|$|Biological {{control for}} broom has been {{investigated}} since the mid-1980s {{with a number of}} species being trialled.
