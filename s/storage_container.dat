5|$|In St. Louis, Anson Stokes, an apathetic {{employee}} at a self storage facility, is yelled at by his boss {{to clean out}} an old and dusty storage locker. To his surprise, he finds a woman wrapped in a rug. His boss comes to check on him; while he is yelling for Anson, his mouth disappears. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) speak with the boss, Jay Gilmore, after surgery to fix his mouth, which has left him disfigured and with a speech impediment. They question Stokes' brother Leslie at their mobile home, which inexplicably has a large boat in its tiny front yard. The woman from the <b>storage</b> <b>container</b> is in the Stokes brothers' kitchen. Mulder and Scully search the container and find old antiques {{and a picture of}} the previous owner with the woman from the apartment.|$|E

25|$|Controlling gas and vapor {{concentrations}} {{outside the}} explosive limits {{is a major}} consideration in occupational safety and health. Methods used to control the concentration of a potentially explosive gas or vapor include use of sweep gas, an unreactive gas such as nitrogen or argon to dilute the explosive gas before coming in contact with air. Use of scrubbers or adsorption resins to remove explosive gases before release are also common. Gases can also be maintained safely at concentrations above the UEL, although a breach in the <b>storage</b> <b>container</b> can lead to explosive conditions or intense fires.|$|E
25|$|Solar cookers {{are less}} useful in cloudy weather {{and near the}} poles (where the sun is {{low in the sky}} or below the horizon), so an {{alternative}} cooking source is still required in these conditions. Solar cooking advocates suggest three devices for an integrated cooking solution: a) a solar cooker; b) a fuel-efficient cookstove; c) an insulated <b>storage</b> <b>container</b> such as a basket filled with straw to store heated food. Very hot food may continue to cook for hours in a well-insulated container. With this three-part solution, fuel use is minimized while still providing hot meals at any hour, reliably.|$|E

25|$|Bree tracked Brooke {{down and}} {{revealed}} they were sisters to a frosty reception. With help from Brooke's boyfriend, Vinnie Kruse (Pua Magasiva), Bree {{landed a job}} at the hospital alongside Brooke. However, after several icey interactions with her sister, Bree ended up dating Vinnie but started to suffer from her lack of self-confidence at work. Vinnie soon discovered Bree had only passed her medical exams by sleeping with her tutor and they broke up. Bree started to blackmail staff to keep her job but was suspended when she nearly killed a patient. Bree was devastated when Annette returned and admitted she had wanted to abort Bree, resulting in Bree holding Annette captive, drugging and, mentally torturing her. Bree lost her job and after working as a medical supplies salesman, began sleeping with Kevin Johns (David Van Horn) under the identity of Brooke. When Brooke discovered the fraud, Bree lost her mind and attempted to murder her, knocking her out and hiding her body in a <b>storage</b> <b>container.</b> The hospital staff soon realised Bree legitimately believed herself to be her sister and once Brooke was discovered, Bree was sectioned to a mental health ward. Bree was relocated to a different city where Brooke continued to visit her.|$|E

John's sons, series protagonists Sam and Dean, retrieve the foot but are cursed by it. Bela interferes when they attempt to destroy it, and shoots Sam in the shoulder. Dean, however, tricks her into touching it. She gives the foot up for destruction to save herself, but manages to steal $46,000 in winning lottery tickets from Dean that he had purchased using the foot's granted luck.|$|E

2500|$|Dutch {{is written}} using the Latin script. Dutch uses one {{additional}} character beyond the standard alphabet, the digraph IJ. It has {{a relatively high}} proportion of doubled letters, both vowels and consonants, due {{to the formation of}} compound words and also to the spelling devices for distinguishing the many vowel sounds in the Dutch language. An example of five consecutive doubled letters is the word voorraaddoos (food <b>storage</b> <b>container).</b> The diaeresis (Dutch: trema) is used to mark vowels that are pronounced separately when involving a pre- or suffix, whereas a hyphen is used when this problem occurs in compound words. For example; [...] "beïnvloed" [...] (influenced), but zee-eend (sea duck). Generally, other diacritical marks only occur in loanwords, though the acute accent can also be used for emphasis or to differentiate between two forms. Its most common use is to differentiate between the indefinite article 'een' (a, an) and the numeral 'één' (one).|$|E

2500|$|Vinyl {{chloride}} {{is stored}} as a liquid. The presently accepted upper limit of safety {{as a health}} hazard [...] is 500 ppm. [...] Often, the storage containers for the product vinyl chloride are high capacity spheres. The spheres have an inside sphere and an outside sphere. Several inches of empty space separate the inside sphere from the outside sphere. This void area between the spheres is purged with an inert gas such as nitrogen. As the nitrogen purge gas exits the void space it passes through an analyzer {{that is designed to}} detect if any vinyl chloride is leaking from the internal sphere. If vinyl chloride starts to leak from the internal sphere or if a fire is detected {{on the outside of the}} sphere then the contents of the sphere are automatically dumped into an emergency underground <b>storage</b> <b>container.</b> Containers [...] used for handling vinyl chloride at atmospheric temperature are always under pressure. [...] Inhibited vinyl chloride may be stored at normal atmospheric conditions in suitable pressure vessel. Uninhibited vinyl chloride may be stored either under refrigeration or at normal atmospheric temperature in the absence of air or sunlight but only for a duration of a few days. If for longer periods, regular checks should be made for the presence of polymers.|$|E
2500|$|In April, {{the sisters}} decided to flat {{together}} but trouble arose with Brooke's flatmate's Bella Cooper (Amelia Reid) and Luke Durville (Gerald Urquhart) refusing to move out. Brooke ended up manipulating the two into relationship problems {{to get them}} out but ultimately helped the two and was at odds with Bree's antagonistic view of the couple. Brooke and Bree's mother Annette (Louise Wallace) returned in July 2012 and the cast enjoyed portraying the relationship between the mother and her illegitimate daughter, with Wallace stating: [...] "It's good looking at the back story and what happened in our relationship and where it all went wrong, why she hates me and why I don't give a rats arse about her. We are deeply flawed." [...] She went on to state that Annette would have never; [...] "anticipated having to deal with this part of her past, so it throws her a real curveball when she arrives and discovers Bree has firmly entrenched herself in Brooke's life" [...] and that; [...] "In some ways, Bree and Annette are more similar than Brooke and Annette, which really riles Annette." [...] Following her lack of respect from Annette, Bree held her captive and mentally tortured her. She decided that life would be easier as Brooke and started to adopt her personality, [...] "All she really wants is acceptance and love and, as we're seeing now, she's finding a way for that to happen by adopting Brooke's persona." [...] The storyline was compared to films: Fatal Attraction and Single White Female, though Blampied tried not to be influenced by them. The storyline climaxed in Bree, under the identity of Brooke, attempting to murder her sister and hiding her body in a <b>storage</b> <b>container.</b> Vinnie realised something was wrong and a search party soon found Brooke. Bree tried to escape but was mown down by a forklift. After finally accepting what she had done was wrong, Bree tried to make up with Brooke but ended up being sectioned to a psychiatric ward.|$|E

40|$|A {{significant}} portion of the Unites States’ annual energy demand is provided by nuclear power. Safe storage of radioactive spent nuclear fuel {{is an essential part of}} the fuel life-cycle. Currently, spent fuel is stored at the reactor site in stainless-steel dry <b>storage</b> <b>containers</b> where the loaded containers are welded shut and backfilled with helium. Since the <b>storage</b> <b>containers</b> are passively cooled with air from the ambient environment, the canisters may become susceptible to atmospheric induced corrosion damage, particularly in the weld sensitized region. To ensure the integrity of the <b>storage</b> <b>containers</b> we are developing a sensor to determine the presence and extent of corrosion damage as well as provide a viable indicator for the future condition of these containers. We have developed a miniature stress corrosion cracking test fixture to provide an early warning signal at the initiation of corrosion damage. These fixtures use a three point bend test configuration to stress stainless steel samples while collecting resistance measurements over time. Sample failure is signaled by a sudden jump in resistance across the sample. The data these sensors provide can help predict the future health of the current <b>storage</b> <b>containers</b> and ensure long-term safe storage...|$|R
