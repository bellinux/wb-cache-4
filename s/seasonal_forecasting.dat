40|$|Several {{operational}} centers routinely issue <b>seasonal</b> <b>forecasts</b> of Earth’s climate using coupled ocean-atmosphere models, {{which require}} near-real-time {{knowledge of the}} state of the global ocean. This paper reviews existing ocean analysis efforts aimed at initializing <b>seasonal</b> <b>forecasts.</b> We show that ocean data assimilation improves the skill of <b>seasonal</b> <b>forecasts</b> in many cases, although its impact can be overshadowed by errors in the coupled models. The current practice, known as “uncoupled” initialization, has the advantage of better knowledge of atmospheric forcing fluxes, but it has the shortcoming of potential initialization shock. In recent years, the idea of obtaining truly “coupled” initialization, where the different components of the coupled system are well balanced, has stimulated several research activities that will be reviewed in light of their application to <b>seasonal</b> <b>forecasts...</b>|$|R

These forecasts are compiled using different models from different institutions. Probability <b>seasonal</b> <b>forecasts</b> can be evaluated using different skill measures, but in this study the Ranked Probability Skill Score (RPSS), Reliability Diagram (RD) and Relative Operating Characteristics (ROC) are used. The RPSS is presented in the form of maps whereas the RD and ROC are analyses are presented in the form of graphs. The aim of the study is to present skill estimates of operational <b>seasonal</b> <b>forecasts</b> issued at South African Weather Service A limited number of forecasts show positive RPSS value throughout the validation period. From RD and ROC analysis, there is no skill in predicting the normal category as compared to below-normal and above-normal categories. Notwithstanding, the frequency diagrams show that the normal category was often given a large weight in the operational forecasts. The value of verifying <b>seasonal</b> <b>forecast</b> accuracy from the user’s perspective is important. The understanding of <b>seasonal</b> <b>forecast</b> performance helps decision makers to determine when and how to respond to expected climate anomalies.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to downscaling soil moisture <b>forecasts</b> from the <b>seasonal</b> ensemble prediction <b>forecasting</b> system of the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) is presented in this study. Soil moisture forecasts from this system are rarely used nowadays, although they could provide valuable information. Weaknesses of the model soil scheme in forecasting soil water content and the low spatial resolution of the <b>seasonal</b> <b>forecasts</b> are the main reason why soil water information has hardly been used so far. The basic idea to overcome {{some of these problems}} is the application of additional information provided by two satellite sensors (ASCAT and Envisat ASAR) to improve the forecast quality, mainly to reduce model bias and increase the spatial resolution. <b>Seasonal</b> <b>forecasts</b> from 2011 and 2012 have been compared to in situ measurement sites in Kenya to test this two-step approach.

40|$|The {{rainfall}} {{in southern}} Africa {{has a large}} inter-annual variability, which can cause rain-fed agriculture to fail. The staple crop maize is especially sensitive to dry spells during the early growing season. An early prediction of the probability of dry spells and below normal precipitation can potentially mitigate damages through water management. This paper investigates how well ECMWF's <b>seasonal</b> <b>forecasts</b> predict dry spells over the Limpopo basin {{during the rainy season}} December–February (DJF) with lead times from 0 to 4 months. The <b>seasonal</b> <b>forecasts</b> were evaluated against ERA-Interim reanalysis data, which in turn were corrected with GPCP (EGPCP) to match monthly precipitation totals. The <b>seasonal</b> <b>forecasts</b> were also bias-corrected with the EGPCP using quantile mapping as well as post-processed using a precipitation threshold to define a dry day. The results indicate that the forecasts show skill in predicting dry spells in comparison with a climatological ensemble based on previous years. Quantile mapping in combination with a precipitation threshold improved the skill of the forecast. The skill in prediction of dry spells was largest over the most drought-sensitive region. <b>Seasonal</b> <b>forecasts</b> have the potential to be used in a probabilistic forecast system for drought-sensitive crops, though these should be used with caution given the large uncertainties...|$|R

This theory led to new research into the relationship between the weather cycle and droughts. Before his forced retirement on 6 February 1931, Hunt was considered the foremost weather expert in Australia with an estimated 87% strike rate.

40|$|Developments in {{meteorology}} {{over the}} last couple of decades have enabled significant improvements to be made in the accuracy of <b>seasonal</b> <b>forecasts.</b> This paper focuses on developing a model for cash crop planning that utilises these forecasts.
