50|$|Located at , {{this site}} {{consists}} of mature flooded gravel workings surrounded by dense fringing vegetation, trees and scrub, affording {{a variety of}} habitats for breeding birds and a refuge for wildfowl. The irregular shoreline, with islands, promontories, shelteredeutrophic pools and narrow lagoons provides undisturbed habitat for many water birds including <b>surface</b> feeding <b>ducks</b> such as teal (Anas crecca) and shoveler (Anas clypeata). The surrounding marsh and scrub are important for numerous birds including nine breeding species of warblers, water rails (Rallus aquaticus), kingfishers (Alcedoa atthis) and an important breeding colony of nightingales (Luscinia megarhynchos).|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted {{to the study of the}} {{relationship}} between integral manifolds of ordinary differential equations and duck trajectories. We derive sufficient conditions for the existence of continuous slow integral surfaces that are devided into stable and unstable parts and propose a method of construction of <b>surfaces</b> consisting of <b>duck</b> trajectories...|$|R
60|$|But Captain Danielson did {{not give}} up. The fifth day we ran off the west side with several other boats, and roamed the sea in search of fins. No {{anchovies}} on the <b>surface,</b> no sheerwater <b>ducks,</b> no sharks, nothing to indicate tuna. About one o'clock Captain Dan sheered southwest and we ran sixteen miles toward Clemente Island.|$|R
40|$|The {{histological}} {{structures of}} the vitelline membranes (VM) of hen and duck eggs were observed by cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM), and the chemical characteristics were also compared. The outer layer <b>surface</b> (OLS) of <b>duck</b> egg VM showed networks constructed by fibrils and sheets (0. 1 - 5. 2 mu m in width), and that of hen egg presented networks formed only by sheets (2 - 6 mu m in width). Thicker fibrils (0. 5 - 1. 5 mu m in width) with different arrangement were observed on the inner layer <b>surface</b> (ILS) of <b>duck</b> egg VM as compared to those (0. 3 - 0. 7 mu m in width) of hen egg VM. Upon separation, the outer surface of the outer layer (OSOL) and the inner surface of the inner layer (ISIL) of hen and duck egg VMs were quite similar to fresh VM except that the OSOL of duck egg VM showed networks constructed only by sheets. Thin fibrils interlaced above a bumpy or flat structure were observed at the exposed surface of the outer layer (ESOL) of hen and duck egg VMs. The exposed surfaces of inner layers (ESIL) of hen and duck egg VMs showed similar structures of fibrils, which joined, branched, and ran in straight lines for long distances up to 30 mu m; however, the widths of the fibrils shown in ESOL and ESIL of duck egg VM were 0. 1 and 0. 7 - 1. 4 mu m, respectively, and were greater than those (< 0. 1 and 0. 5 - 0. 8 mu m) of hen egg VM. The continuous membranes of both hen and duck egg VMs were still attached to the outer layers when separated. The content of protein, the major component of VM, was higher in duck egg VM (88. 6 %) than in hen egg VM (81. 6 %). Four and six major SDS-soluble protein patterns with distinct localization were observed in hen and duck egg VMs, respectively. Overall, the different histological structures of hen and duck egg VMs were suggested to be majorly attributable to the diverse protein components...|$|R
40|$|Tests {{by several}} Land control {{agencies}} detected Campylobacter spp. {{on several occasions}} in duck breast samples. In humans the germ can cause severe foodborne infections with symptoms like diarrhoea and vomiting. The bacterium is typically found on poultry meat in particular. In 2005 the Robert Koch Institute recorded {{for the first time}} more Campylobacter than Salmonella infections in Germany. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) assesses below the health risk for consumers of developing campylobacteriosis after eating duck breast. Frequently, the data tend rather to record the incidence of the microorganism in general in poultry meat. Based on the available studies it can be assumed that around 40 % of all cases of Campylobacter disease {{can be attributed to the}} consumption of poultry meat. Campylobacter are detected most frequently on the <b>surface</b> of <b>duck</b> breast which means that searing of the meat will kill most of the heat-sensitive germs. In individual cases Campylobacter are also detected inside the meat. The searing process merely reduces the risk of infection. Refrigeration and freezing cannot reliably kill the Campylobacter either. BfR is of the opinion that the risk of cross-contamination constitutes a higher health risk than the consumption of inadequately cooked poultry meat. The source of cross-contamination is not only the raw poultry meat itself but also the packaging that is contaminated with germs. BfR recommends to consumers that they should heat duck breast for at least 10 minutes at temperatures above 74 °C and they should pay attention to the other rules of food and kitchen hygiene like clean hands and work surfaces in order to avoid the cross-contamination of ready-to-eat foods like, for instance, salads...|$|R
40|$|Much of my artistic {{inspiration}} {{comes from}} my walks in nature. I explore {{the many different}} textures of stones, wood chips, tree bark, water ripples, lily pads, birds 2 ̆ 7 feathers, and webbed feet. I find that the reflections {{on the surface of}} a pond, and the shadows and highlights on my subjects, are most beautifully captured as they are veiled by the dusk sunset. Sometimes I prefer to capture an image more inclusive of the environment. Other times I am more intrigued by the up close view of a subject, sometimes abstracting it. Through photography I can capture the quiet moments in nature, whether shooting an image of the graceful gaze in a goose 2 ̆ 7 s eye, or the ripples created on a pond 2 ̆ 7 s <b>surface</b> after a <b>duck</b> glides by. The colors of nature are quite beautiful, but often add an extra element of distraction in photos. Soft black and white nature images are my way of providing a quiet contrast to the everyday hustle and bustle we have all become so accustomed to...|$|R
40|$|Gp 180, a duck {{protein that}} was {{proposed}} to be a cell <b>surface</b> receptor for <b>duck</b> hepatitis B virus, is the homolog of metallocarboxypeptidase D, a mammalian protein thought {{to function in}} the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in the processing of proteins that transit the secretory pathway. Both gp 180 and mammalian metallocarboxypeptidase D are type I integral membrane proteins that contain a 58 -residue cytosolic C-terminal tail that is highly conserved between duck and rat. To investigate the regions of the gp 180 tail involved with TGN retention and intracellular trafficking, gp 180 and various deletion and point mutations were expressed in the AtT- 20 mouse pituitary corticotroph cell line. Full length gp 180 is enriched in the TGN and also cycles to the cell surface. Truncation of the C-terminal 56 residues of the cytosolic tail eliminates the enrichment in the TGN and the retrieval from the cell surface. Truncation of 12 – 43 residues of the tail reduced retention in the TGN and greatly accelerated the turnover of the protein. In contrast, deletion of the C-terminal 45 residues, which truncates a potential YxxL-like sequence (FxxL), reduced the protein turnover and caused accumulation of the protein on the cell surface. A point mutation of the FxxL sequence to AxxL slowed internalization, showing that this element is important for retrieval from the cell surface. Mutation {{of a pair of}} casein kinase II sites within an acidic cluster showed that they are also important for trafficking. The present study demonstrates that multiple sequence elements within the cytoplasmic tail of gp 180 participate in TGN localization...|$|R
40|$|When humans {{perceive}} the lightness of an object's surface in shadows {{there is an}} implicit assumption that cast shadows dim the surface. In two experiments, we investigated whether 5 - to 8 -month-old infants make this assumption about shadows. According to this shadow assumption, the apparent change in lightness produced by shadows on an object's surface are attributed to blocked light sources. If infants can use the shadow assumption to {{perceive the}} object's lightness in shadows, they will {{also be able to}} detect unnatural lightness changes in shadows. We compared the infants' looking times to the unnatural and the natural lightness changes in the shadow when an object (duck) goes through the cast shadow. In Experiment 1, we examined whether infants could detect the unnatural lightness changes of the object's surface in shadows. We created computer-graphic movies of unnatural and natural lightness changes to the <b>duck's</b> <b>surface.</b> Our results showed that 7 - to 8 -month-olds but not 5 - to 6 -month-olds significantly preferred the movie with the unnatural changes in lightness, indicating that only the older infants could detect these changes. In Experiment 2, we confirmed that the infants' preference was based on the detection of unnatural lightness changes according to the shadow assumption. The natural and the unnatural lightness changes of Experiment 1 were presented without cast shadows. Under these conditions, neither younger nor older infants showed a significant preference. Taken together, the experiments showed that 7 - to 8 -month-old infants could detect the unnaturalness of a surface's lightness changes produced by shadows. In conclusion, our findings suggest that 7 - to 8 -month-old infants can perceive an object's lightness in shadows by using an assumption that cast shadows dim the surface of an object...|$|R
