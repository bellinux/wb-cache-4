5|$|The spotted {{sandgrouse}} is a ground-dwelling bird and feeds on seeds and other plant material that it finds among the scrubby vegetation of its dry habitat. During the breeding season it is solitary but {{at other times}} of year it is gregarious. Flocks move into a new feeding ground after a storm has stimulated new green growth. In the Sahara the {{spotted sandgrouse}} are particularly fond of a species of spurge and concentrate on this until the foliage begins to parch, after which the birds return to their normal diet of seeds. These are abundant on the desert floor, remaining in a dormant state until rain occurs. The birds are very wary and easily frightened. Their chief enemy is the lanner falcon which flies rapidly just above the ground and scoops up any unwary bird. The sandgrouse strategy is to have one bird flying high overhead. When it sees an approaching falcon it gives a warning call and the other sandgrouse freeze. So good is their camouflage that the raptor is unable to detect them and flies on. Sandgrouse {{need to make a}} daily journey to a drinking hole, which may be many kilometres from their feeding ground. They land a short distance from the water and maintain a sentinel system here too as, beside the falcons, mammal predators may lurk nearby and nomads may water their herds. When all is safe, another distinctive call from the <b>sentinel</b> <b>bird</b> sends all the others to the pool where their daily water needs are taken up within about fifteen seconds.|$|E
50|$|The yellow-billed babbler {{lives in}} flocks of seven to ten or more. It is a noisy bird, and the {{presence}} of a flock may generally be known at some distance by the continual chattering, squeaking and chirping produced by its members. One member often perches high and acts as a sentinel while the remaining members of the flock forage on or close to the ground. They feeds mainly on insects, but also eat fruit, nectar and human food scrap. They have been known to take Calotes versicolor lizard and whip-scorpions. They do not fly long distances, the maximum distance flown non-stop was about 180 m and prior to flying, they usually gain height by moving up a tree or tall shrub. Black drongos, rufous treepies and Indian palm squirrels are often seen foraging near these babblers.Birds wake up before dawn around 6 AM and begin foraging. They are relatively inactive in the hot hours of the day from 1330 to 1630. They assemble in groups around 1900 hrs and preen themselves before going to roost. Members of a group roost next to each other with some juveniles wedging themselves {{in the middle of the}} group. When foraging the <b>sentinel</b> <b>bird</b> calls with wing fluttering and hopping. Allopreening is a common activity, particularly in winter, and members may beg for food from other members.Yellow-billed babblers particularly like to take baths, and may visit birdbaths in their general territories, usually around late afternoon to evening time. Sometimes these birds have been observed visiting birdbaths at around 18:30hours, after sunset, when darkness is beginning to set in.|$|E
40|$|Salmonella Enteritidis {{remains a}} {{significant}} issue within the poultry industry and one potential {{solution is to}} use probiotic bacteria to prevent Salmonella colonisation through competitive exclusion (CE). We demonstrate that combined administration of Lactobacillus salivarius 59 and Enterococcus faecium PXN 33 were effective competitive excluders of Salmonella Enteritidis S 1400 in poultry. Two models were developed to evaluate the efficacy of probiotic where birds received Salmonella Enteritidis S 1400 by a) oral gavage and b) <b>sentinel</b> <b>bird</b> to bird transmission. A statistically significant (p < 0. 001) 2 log reduction of Salmonella Enteritidis S 1400 colonisation was observed in the ileum, caecum and colon at day 43 using combined administration of the two probiotic bacteria. However, no Salmonella Enteritidis S 1400 colonisation reduction was observed when either probiotic was administered individually. In the <b>sentinel</b> <b>bird</b> model the combined probiotic administered at days 12 and 20 was more effective than one-off or double administrations at age 1 and 12 days. In vitro cell free culture supernatant studies suggest the mechanism of Salmonella Enteritidis S 1400 inhibition was due {{to a reduction in}} pH by the probiotic bacteria. Our current study provides further evidence that probiotics can significantly reduce pathogenic bacterial colonisation in poultry and that mixed preparation of probiotics provide superior performance when compared to individual bacterial preparations...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Invasions {{of exotic}} species have created {{environmental}} havoc through competition and dis-placement of native plants and animals. The introduction of hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata) into the United States in the 1960 s has been detrimental to navigation, power generation, water intake, {{and water quality}} (McCann et al., 1996). Our field surveys and feeding studies have now implicated exotic hydrilla and asso-ciated epiphytic cyanobacterial species as a link to avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM), an emerging avian disease affecting herbivorous waterbirds and their avian predators. AVM, first reported in 1994, has caused the death of at least 100 bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and thousands of American coots (Fulica americana) at 11 sites from Texas to North Carolina (Thomas et al., 1998; Rocke et al., 2002). Our working hypothesis is that the agent of this disease is an uncharacterized neurotoxin produced by a novel cyanobacterial epiphyte of the order Stigonematales. This undescribed species covers up to 95 % of the surface area of leaves in reservoirs where bird deaths have occurred from the disease. In addition, this species is rare or not found on hydrilla collected at sites where AVM disease has not been diagnosed. Laboratory feeding trials and a <b>sentinel</b> <b>bird</b> study using naturally occurring blooms of cyanobacteria on hydrilla leaves and farm-raised mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) induced the disease experimentally. Since 1994 AVM has been diagnosed in additional sites from Texas to North Carolina. Specific site char...|$|E
40|$|It {{is often}} of {{interest}} to predict spatially correlated count outcomes/responses that follow a Poisson distribution. In a public health setting this would include disease incidence or mortality rates. One such disease {{that we would like}} to predict the incidence of is West Nile virus. West Nile virus is an arthropod-borne virus most commonly spread by infected mosquitoes, with most infections occurring from June to September. Count data for the number of West Nile virus cases in humans are available at the county level for each state in the U. S, from 2000 - 2014. Also collected are counts of infected birds as well as environmental predictors. ^ To predict a Poisson outcome variable in the presence of an auxiliary variable, Poisson cokriging as a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) is proposed. This model has a bivariate structure with a Poisson outcome variable and an auxiliary variable. A covariance matrix similar to that used in cokriging is assumed. In a simulation study, prediction results from the Poisson cokriging model are compared to a GLMM model with a Poisson outcome treating the auxiliary variable as a fixed effect covariate. Various distributions for the auxiliary variable are also considered. Poisson cokriging was examined {{in the context of a}} real data example using the human West Nile virus data from Nebraska with <b>sentinel</b> <b>bird</b> and percent irrigated land as auxiliary variables. Leave one out cross-validation was used to assess prediction in Nebraska counties. ^ The simulation study showed that Poisson cokriging methodology can be applied successfully in practice and will allow for a variety of distributions for the auxiliary variable, including normal, gamma, and Poisson. The back-transformation method of prediction showed smaller average prediction errors compared to the direct method, but showed slightly larger root prediction mean square error and coverage. When comparing the Poisson cokriging to the Poisson fixed model, the results were similar between the two models. When predicting human West Nile virus incidence the Poisson cokriging model showed excellent results with small average errors and coverage closed to 95 %. The Poisson cokriging model works well and is an excellent tool. ...|$|E

In Tunisia, two outbreaks of WNF occurred in humans in 1997 and 2003; sporadic cases were reported on several other years. Small-scale serological surveys revealed the presence of antibodies against WN virus (WNV) in equid sera. However, clinical cases were never reported in equids, although their population is abundant in Tunisia. This study was achieved to characterize the nationwide serological status of WNV in Tunisian equids. In total, 1189 sera were collected in 2009 during a cross-sectional survey. Sera were tested for IgG antibodies, using ELISA and microneutralization tests. The estimated overall seroprevalence rate was 28 %, 95 % confidence interval [22; 34]. The highest rates were observed (i) in the north-eastern governorates (Jendouba, 74 %), (ii) on the eastern coast (Monastir, 64 %) and (iii) in the lowlands of Chott El Jerid and Chott el Gharsa (Kebili, 58 %; Tozeur, 52 %). Environmental risk factors were assessed, including various indicators of wetlands, wild avifauna, night temperature and chlorophyllous activity (normalized difference vegetation index: NDVI). Multimodel inference showed that lower distance to ornithological sites and wetlands, lower night-time temperature, and higher NDVI in late spring and late fall were associated with higher serological prevalence rate. The model-predicted nationwide map of WNF seroprevalence rate in Tunisian equids highlighted different areas with high seroprevalence probability. These findings are discussed in the perspective of implementing a better WNF surveillance system in Tunisia. This system might rely on (i) a longitudinal survey of <b>sentinel</b> <b>birds</b> in high-risk areas and time periods for WNV transmission, (ii) investigations of bird die-offs and (iii) syndromic surveillance of equine meningoencephalitis.

40|$|Disease {{prevalence}} in wildlife {{is governed}} by epidemiological parameters (infection and recovery rates) and response to infection, both of which vary within and among individual hosts. Studies quantifying these individual-scale parameters and documenting their source of variation in wild hosts are fundamental for predicting disease dynamics. Such studies do not exist for the influenza A virus (IAV), despite its strong impact on the global economy and public health. Using capture–recaptures of 3500 individual mallards Anas platyrhynchos during seven migration seasons at a stopover site in southern Sweden, we provide the first empirical description of the individual-based mechanisms of IAV dynamics in a wild reservoir host. For most years, prevalence and risk of IAV infection peaked at a single time during the autumn migration season, but the timing, shape and intensity of the infection curve showed strong annual heterogeneity. In contrast, the seasonal pattern of recovery rate only varied in intensity across years. Adults and juveniles displayed similar seasonal patterns of infection and recovery each year. However, compared to adults, juveniles experienced twice the risk of becoming infected, whereas recovery rates were similar across age categories. Finally, {{we did not find}} evidence that infection influenced the timing of emigration. Synthesis and applications. Our study provides robust empirical estimates of epidemiological parameters for predicting influenza A virus (IAV) dynamics. However, the strong annual variation in infection curves makes forecasting difficult. Prevalence data can provide reliable surveillance indicators as long as they catch the variation in infection risk. However, individual-based monitoring of infection is required to verify this assumption in areas where surveillance occurs. In this context, monitoring of captive <b>sentinel</b> <b>birds</b> kept in close contact with wild birds is useful. The fact that infection does not impact the timing of migration underpins the potential for mallards to spread viruses rapidly over large geographical scales. Hence, we strongly encourage IAV surveillance with a multistate capture–recapture approach along the entire migratory flyway of mallards. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

The 2 ̆ 2 microenvironment concept 2 ̆ 2 hypothesizes that aquatic invertebrate carcasses may serve both as a substrate for toxin production by Clostridium botulinum type C in nature and as a vehicle for toxin transmission to waterbirds. This concept has become the generally accepted, but inadequately tested, working hypothesis of type C botulism epizootiology. This study attempted to experimentally induce type C botulism in sentinel flocks of mallard ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and American coots (Fulica americana) on sewage oxidation ponds in northern Utah. The three experimental oxidation ponds were inoculated with Cl. botulinum type C (strain X 220 B 2) endospores in June,l 974. Aquatic invertebrate populations were monitored throughout the summer. Rotenone was used in August in two of the experimental ponds (one pond served as a control) to kill aquatic invertebrates and thereby provide a large amount of substrate for clostridial growth and toxin production. No botulism was detected among the <b>sentinel</b> <b>birds</b> even though they routinely ingested invertebrate carcasses. None of the samples of dead invertebrates collected from the experimental ponds contained detectable (in white mice) botulinum toxin. It was concluded that the 2 ̆ 2 microenvironment concept, 2 ̆ 2 as it now stands, cannot always be a sufficient explanation of how type C botulism epizootics are initiated in nature. Microbiological experiments designed to determine why the invertebrate carcasses collected from the study ponds contained no botulinum toxin were started and are now ongoing. Early results indicate that Cl. botulinum (X 220 B 2) cells may not normally be able to effectively compete (at least in terms of toxin production) with other microorganisms present in the sewage ponds. It is suggested that the initiation of a type C botulism epizootic in nature may require the alleviation of the inhibitory effects of other putrefactive microorganisms upon clostridial metabolism and/ or toxin. This hypothesis is highly speculative and requires much further experimentation...|$|R
40|$|A list of {{the working}} group members appears {{at the end of}} the article. Background: The first reports of West Nile virus (WNV) {{infection}} in the United States in 1999 prompted Ontario to establish a surveillance protocol to monitor for the possible spread of the virus into the province. Surveillance components included evaluation of dead <b>birds,</b> <b>sentinel</b> chickens, mosquito pools and hu-man disease. We report the results of human surveillance in 2000. Methods: Between July 1 and Oct. 31, 2000, an active surveillance program was undertaken in which designated site coordinators in sentinel hospitals identified patients who met the suspect case definition (fever and fluctuating level of con-sciousness [encephalopathy], with or without muscle weakness). During the same period, following province-wide distribution of educational material, all other patients tested for WNV antibodies were identified through review o...|$|R
40|$|Arboviral Arboviruses Infections include — mosquitoborne Continued and tickborne {{agents that}} {{persist in nature}} in complex cycles {{involving}} birds or mammals, including humans. Arboviral infection can cause fever, headache, meningitis, encephalitis, and sometimes death. During 1996 – 1997, health departments in 19 states reported to CDC 286 confirmed or probable* cases (eight fatal) of arboviral encephalitis in humans (132 cases in 1996 and 154 provisionally in 1997). Surveillance programs in 18 states detected enzootic arboviral activity in mosquito or <b>sentinel</b> or wild <b>bird</b> populations, and cases of arboviral disease were recognized among horses or emus in 24 states. This report summarizes information about arboviral infection of {{the central nervous system}} in the United States during 1996 – 1997. La Crosse Encephalitis During 1996 – 1997, a total of 252 La Crosse encephalitis (LAC) cases (103 confirmed and 149 probable; one fatal) were reported from 12 states. Patients ranged in age from 5 months to 78 years (mean: 9 years), and 95 % of cases occurred in persons aged < 18 years; 153 (61 %) cases occurred in males, 209 (83 %) in whites, and seven (3 %) i...|$|R
40|$|West Nile Virus (WNV) {{was first}} {{isolated}} {{from a woman}} in Uganda in 1937. West Nile Virus {{first appeared in the}} United States in 1999 in New York. This was the first occurrence of WNV in the Western Hemisphere. West Nile Virus is a mosquito-borne virus (arbovirus). It {{is a member of the}} family Flaviviradae, which includes Dengue and Yellow Fever. West Nile Virus is closely related to Japanese encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, and Kunjin virus. It can cause a febrile illness and in some rare cases encephalitis and death. The transmission cycle typically occurs between mosquitoes, the vector, and bird, the amplifier. Humans and equines are considered dead-end hosts. West Nile Virus was first detected in Florida in 2001, which marked the spread of the virus from Northeastern U. S. to the Southeastern states. For 2001, Florida had 12 of the 66 human cases, and 66 % of the equine cases in the U. S. Since the arrival of WNV in Florida the Alachua County Health Department has been monitoring for the presence of the virus through the surveillance of dead <b>birds,</b> <b>sentinel</b> chickens, equines cases, and human cases. The goal of this project was to develop a survey that can be used to assess the knowledge of WNV, attitudes towards WNV and pesticide spraying, and the likelihood of performing self-protection and mosquito reduction behaviors. A sampling scheme was developed using a combination of stratified cluster sampling and quota sampling. A preliminary sample size of 250 household surveys is needed...|$|R
40|$|West Nile is an {{important}} novel virus in the United States, having spread rapidly since it was first detected in New York in 1999. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention {{as well as many}} State Health Departments, have mandated programs for surveillance of West Nile Virus activity. These programs incorporate many different aspects including existing arboserology programs with additional testing for West Nile Virus and new plans that incorporate active and passive surveillance methods. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine all aspects of the Florida West Nile surveillance program to determine if there was transmission in the animal systems prior to human cases. The predictive analyses were done using regional data graphs, spatial information, correlations and regression models. Data for <b>sentinel</b> chickens, <b>bird</b> necropsy and mosquito pool surveillance from participating counties in Florida were obtained from the State of Florida surveillance database. The human data was obtained from the State of Florida reportable disease database for each county whether participating in the state surveillance programs or not. Clinical cases were examined by demographics (gender and age) and an incidence rate was calculated to demonstrate the effects of disease. Specific statistical methods used included Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s coefficient correlation, Poisson distribution regression modeling to show if any of the surveillance systems were predictors for human disease. The incidence rate analysis for clinical cases showed clustering of cases in adjacent counties within a region where Florida 2 ̆ 7 s panhandle and adjacent counties northeast had the highest incidence. Florida 2 ̆ 7 s central and southern regions had moderate human incidence. This provides useful information in transmission geography for prevention and control measures. Demographic analysis showed that there were twice as many males than females diagnosed with West Nile in Florida, this was true across the groups as well. The highest number of cases was seen within the age group over 55 years of age for West Nile Neuroinvasive Disease and for West Nile Fever the highest number of cases was within the 36 - 54 age range. The temporal distribution was determined using graphical representations of all of the surveillance types and clinical cases. In order to include all relevant data, the temporality was set from week 20 to week 52. This study found that all of the surveillance types (dead <b>birds,</b> mosquitoes and <b>sentinels)</b> offered a specialized strength for predicting clinical cases. However, mosquitoes proved to be the least efficient out of the three surveillance systems. The regional and spatial analysis showed that positive dead <b>birds</b> and <b>sentinels</b> provided the coverage for the surveillance systems in the state. However, Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s correlation coefficient was low for sentinel surveillance; this may be due to higher participation showing West Nile Virus activity in areas (especially rural) that have no reported human cases. This analysis did show that West Nile is detected in mosquito pool samples before it is detected in the dead <b>bird</b> or <b>sentinel</b> surveillance systems which provides an earlier warning for human cases. The Poisson distribution regression model was only useful for the pooled years and 2003. These showed that mosquitoes, positive dead <b>birds</b> and <b>sentinels</b> were good predictors for clinical cases for the combined years and dead <b>birds</b> and <b>sentinels</b> were significant for 2003 as well. The recommendations based on the results from this study would be to continue all the current surveillance efforts but with the following enhancements: 1. Increase the coverage and consistency of submissions for all surveillance types. 2. Set standard levels of participation for all counties based on the regional analyses and populations at risk. 3. Create standardized approaches for sampling, shipping and submitting samples (especially for mosquito pool submissions) and require that participating counties adhere to these standards. 4. Only submit specific birds known to be especially susceptible to West Nile Virus (e. g. corvids). 5. Targeted prevention and education strategies for higher risk groups based on their potential levels of exposure...|$|R
