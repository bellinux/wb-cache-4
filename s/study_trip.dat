In July 1914 the company started securing sufficient spare parts and increasing its purchases of coal and food. As it was difficult to sell ore, the workforce was instead put to preparatory work, such as preparing new areas for mining, emptying one pit of water and lowering the water level in Bjørnevatnet by three meters (10ft). In addition the company built up a surplus of ore. Henrik Lund took a <b>study</b> <b>trip</b> to the United States in 1916, where he visited more than twenty cities and brought a series of innovations with him back.

2500|$|After a <b>study</b> <b>trip</b> to the United States in 1916, Director Fredrik Kleven {{made the}} {{observation}} that wider vehicles were in use there. He brought the idea back to Trondheim, and the company made a policy to increase {{the distance between the}} tracks of a double line to allow wider [...] cars to be put into service. This would allow four-abreast seating, and much higher capacity than with the existing stock. Five new Class 4 wide trams were delivered in 1930, after the Ila and Lademoen Lines had been rebuilt. Graakalbanen had taken trams of this width into use in 1924 along the Ila Line.|$|E

2500|$|Pogor {{completed}} his education in France.

As argued by author Gheorghe Manolache, Pogor was one of those who saw French culture as [...] "speculative", and sought to amend its influence with German or Anglophone borrowings. In late 1851, he took an extended <b>study</b> <b>trip</b> through the German Confederation, in lieu of service in the Moldavian military forces.

[...] His work also inspired the City Beautiful Movement in the United States. [...] Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of Central Park in New York, visited the Bois de Boulogne eight times during his 1859 <b>study</b> <b>trip</b> to Europe, and was also influenced by the innovations of the Parc des Buttes Chaumont.

Another Romanian colleague in Vienna, linguist Vasile Burlă, also found Poor Dionis to be of an [...] "extravagant and sensationalistic" [...] Romantic nature. Their claims to have known the work {{in its early stages}} is contrasted by the recollections of yet another Vienna student, Teodor V. Ștefanelli. He writes: [...] "Eminescu never shared with anyone what he was writing on, and if he had written something he would not even show it to his roommates, but locked away his manuscript.

2500|$|Although the {{official}} {{policy of the}} Nazi regime was in favour of an independent Slovak state dependent on Germany and was opposed to any annexations of Slovak territory, Heinrich Himmler's SS considered ambitious population policy options concerning the German minority of Slovakia, which numbered circa 130,000 people. In 1940, Günther Pancke, head of the SS RuSHA ("Race and Settlement Office") undertook a <b>study</b> <b>trip</b> in Slovak lands where ethnic Germans were present, and reported to Himmler that the Slovak Germans {{were in danger of}} disappearing. Pancke recommended that action should be taken to fuse the racially valuable part of the Slovaks into the German minority and remove the Gypsy and Jewish populations. He stated that this would be possible by [...] "excluding" [...] the Hungarian minority of the country, and by settling some 100,000 ethnic German families to Slovakia. The racial core of this Germanization policy was to be gained from the Hlinka Guard, which was to be further integrated into the SS in the near future.|$|E

One of Ishii's main supporters inside the army was Colonel Chikahiko Koizumi, who later became Japan's Health Minister from 1941 to 1945.

In 1940, Rădulescu-Motru likewise argued that Iorga had been [...] "a creator... of unparalleled fecundity", while Enciclopedia Cugetarea deemed him the greatest-ever mind in Romania.
