40|$|Mizuho Plateau is {{classified}} into an ablation zone and three different accumulation zones from the regional distribution of {{thickness of the}} annual layer accumulated snow measured during ten years beginning in 1968 using the <b>snow</b> <b>stake</b> method, and from {{the locations of the}} ablation area provided by images of ERTS satellite. A <b>snow</b> <b>stake</b> along a traverse route gave the thickness of the annual layer at a given place in a given year; the thickness there in another year in which measurements were not made was obtained by extrapolation, using a value of annual variation in areal average in each of the zones; then, the thickness was averaged over the ten years. In addition, stratigraphic data provided thicknesses and the density profile of the surface layers at a given place. Consequently, contours indicating the surface mass balance averaged over the ten years were obtained and delineated on the topographical map of Mizuho Plateau. It was then derived from the contour map that the total mass inputs in the Shirase and the Soya drainage basin are respectively 15. 5 and 1. 2 Gt/yr. Moreover, from the result of discussions of the general role concerning the characteristics of the distribution of the mass balance related to the topography, the emergence/submergence flow of the ice sheet and the action of katabatic winds, it is suggested that the positive and the negative balance take place {{on the surface of the}} ice sheet in such a direction that the unilateral changes due to the perturbation deposition of solid precipitation and the vertical flow of the ice sheet cancel out, resulting in the maintenance of the morphological features of the ice sheet...|$|E

Snow depth was measured at the Centre for Atmospheric Research Experiments (CARE) site of the Environment Canada (EC) during the 2013 – 2014 winter experiment. The snow depth measurement system at the CARE site was comprised of three bases. Three ultrasonic and one laser snow depth sensors and twelve <b>snow</b> <b>stakes</b> were placed on each base. Data from snow depth sensors are quality-controlled by range check and step test to eliminate erroneous data such as outliers and discontinuities. In comparison with manual observations, bias errors were calculated to show the spatial distribution of snow depth by considering snow depth measured from four <b>snow</b> <b>stakes</b> located on the easternmost side of the site as reference. The bias error of <b>snow</b> <b>stakes</b> {{on the west side}} of the site was largest. The uncertainty of all pairs of stakes and the average uncertainty for each base were 1. 81 and 1. 52 cm, respectively. The bias error and normalized bias removed root mean square error (NBRRMSE) for each snow depth sensor were calculated to quantify the systematic error and random error in comparison of snow depth sensors with manual observations that share the same snow depth target. The snow depth sensors on base 12 A (11 A) measured snow depth larger (less) than manual observation up to 10. 8 cm (5. 21 cm), and the NBRRMSEs ranged from 5. 10 to 16. 5 %.

40|$|The Antarctic Ice Sheet {{exhibits}} a strong anisotropy in microwave backscatter, {{both as a}} function of azimuth angle and incidence angle. This anisotropy arises as a result of i) the alignment of roughness elements and other wind-related surface and sub-surface features, as well as ii) internal layers and snow grain size gradient within the snowpack. As a result of its antenna configuration, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) satellite instrument is able to observe much of the continent with a large azimuth and incidence angle diversity. A lack of azimuth and incidence diversity has restricted previous backscatter parameterisations to relatively simple bi-sinusoidal (azimuth angle) and linear (incidence angle) parameterisations. Using ASCAT, we show that a better fit can be obtained using a cubic incidence angle function and a Fourier series of up to four terms for parameterisation of the azimuth angle anisotropy. Scatterometer instruments have previously been used in Greenland to retrieve accumulation rate by observing the change in backscatter {{as a function of}} incidence angle.

40|$|The {{synoptic}} {{origins of}} precipitation {{on the western}} side of the Antarctic Peninsula over the one year period March 1992 to February 1993 are investigated using meteorological observations, satellite imagery and analyses produced by the UK Meteorological Office. Precipitation at Rothera Station was found to occur at 30 % of the synoptic reporting time with 80 % of precipitation reports being associated with cyclonic disturbances. Although three quarters of all precipitation reports were for snow, the proximity of Rothera to the zone of maximum cyclonic activity meant that incursions of mild air produced rain in all seasons. During the year 95 % of all precipitation was classed as slight. Variability of precipitation on the intraseasonal timescale was highly dependent on the synoptic-scale circulation. The most common synoptic situation for precipitation was a frontal cyclone over the Bellingshausen Sea which accounted for 38 % of all precipitation events and 62 % of the moderate and heavy precipitation reports. Of the extra-tropical cyclones that gave precipitation 49 % were found to have developed south of 60 °S.

The deposition of snow occurs mainly in the winter season from February to September; on the contrary, the erosion of snow occurs in the summer season from November to January. Maximum values of accumulation rate were found at both the equinoxes. As for the coastal region between 1000 m and 1700 m a. s. l., the maximum annual accumulation during seven years from 1968 to 1974 was observed in 1970,which is about 2. 5 {{times larger than the}} minimum which was observed in 1969.

40|$|As {{part of the}} Antarctic Climate Research (ACR) program, a {{study of}} the atmosphere/sea-ice/ocean {{interaction}} was conducted off Queen Maud-Enderby Land, Antarctica. Two-year field observations were carried out to clarify the effect of snow cover on growth processes of sea ice in Ongul Strait from April, 1990 to December, 1991. Routine measurements of the length of <b>snow</b> <b>stakes,</b> <b>snow</b> depth and ice thickness were made about every month at three stations across the Strait. Sea ice cores were collected to assess their structure and temperature. Then, salinity and oxygen isotope concentration profiles of the melted ice samples were determined at intervals of about 0. 1 m. The snow depth varies consistently from 0 to about 1 meter across the Strait, increasing with distance from the Antarctic Continent. The snow depth affects both the growth and structure of sea ice. In winter, the growth rate is higher in bare ice regions than in snow-covered regions. However, over the year, the ice thickness itself is lower in bare ice regions than in snow-covered regions, in contrast to the common notion that snow cover is associated with a decrease in the growth rate of sea ice. Sea ice in the snow-covered regions increased in thickness in spring rather than in winter. The analyses of the sea-ice structure and the oxygen isotope concentration suggest that such growth processes are caused by the formation of snow ice and by ice formation related to the melting of snow cover. Ice thickness decreases drastically in bare ice regions in summer owing to melting at the bottom surface and inside the ice due to oceanic heat flux and absorption of solar radiation, respectively. In contrast, the decrease is not so great in snow-covered regions due to thermal insulation by the snow cover, leading to thicker sea ice. Major ion concentration profiles of the melted sea-ice samples were also determined. These measurements show that the sea ice samples have a tendency to enrich the concentrations of K^+ and Na^+ and to reduce that of SO_ 4 ^ relative to sea water...|$|R

Research on the spatial characteristics of snow depth and sea-ice thickness and of the growth processes of sea ice {{was carried out in}} Lutzow-Holm Bay. The lengths of <b>snow</b> <b>stakes,</b> <b>snow</b> depths and sea-ice thicknesses were all measured at ten offshore stations on two latitudinal lines in April, August and October of both years. Sea ice cores were also collected to assess structure, temperature and salinity in 1991. Spatial variations of snow depth and sea ice thickness were clearly noticed. The stations near the Antarctic Continent have little snow cover. However, the snow depth increased consistently with distance from the Continent, reaching a nearly constant maximum value of 1 to 1. 5 m during the winter. The increase of ice thickness paralleled that of snow depth, the maximum thickness at the offshore stations being 2 to 3 m. No differences in these variations were recognized between the two observation lines. The snow depth was found to significantly affect the sea-ice growth processes. At the station with little snow cover, the sea ice grew in the austral winter months and decayed in summer to the thickness of the previous year. The sea ice repeats this growth and decay cycle annually and consequently is limited in thickness to approximately 2 m. On the contrary, in the heavily snow-covered regions, the sea ice showed little growth even in the winter, because the thick snow cover and sea ice itself reduced the vertical heat flux and accordingly the growth rate due to bottom freezing. In summer, however, an extreme increase of sea ice thickness of 0. 5 to 1 m was observed. The growth is probably caused by refreezing of low-salinity meltwater from the snow cover. An aquifer about 0. 2 m deep was found to exist on the snow/ice interface in January 1992. This fact suggests that the sea ice growth {{can be attributed to the}} formation of superimposed ice...|$|R

50|$|Compacted snow {{conditions}} allow mountaineers {{to progress}} on foot. Frequently crampons {{are required to}} travel efficiently over snow and ice. Crampons attach to a mountaineer's boots to provide additional traction on hard snow (névé) and ice. Using various techniques from alpine skiing and mountaineering to ascend/descend a mountain {{is a form of}} the sport by itself, called ski mountaineering. Ascending and descending a snow slope safely requires the use of an ice axe and many different footwork techniques that have been developed over the past century, mainly in Europe (e.g. French technique and German technique). The progression of footwork from the lowest angle slopes to the steepest terrain is first to splay the feet to a rising traverse, to kicking steps, to front pointing the crampons. The progression of ice axe technique from the lowest angle slopes to the steepest terrain is to use the ice axe first as a walking stick, then a stake, then to use the front pick as a dagger below the shoulders or above, and finally to swinging the pick into the slope over the head. These various techniques may involve questions of differing ice-axe design depending on terrain, and even whether a mountaineer uses one or two ice axes. Anchors for the rope in snow are sometimes unreliable, and include the <b>snow</b> <b>stakes,</b> called pickets, deadman devices called flukes which are fashioned from aluminium, or devised from buried objects that might include an ice axe, skis, rocks or other objects.

Equipments used : D- 55 A type Automatic Direction Finder (Similar type with GMD- 1 A) JMA-RSII Rawinsonde, 1680 Mc JMA-SIII Radiosonde, 27 Mc 800 g Balloon (Latex) CaH_ 2 Cans for Hydrogen gas to fill balloons. Monthly average temperatures and heights were shown in respective figures. In September, combined with the surface temperature, the strong warm-air inflow throughout the troposphere below 300 mb could be seen. A rapid warming in the stratosphere in spring was also clearly observed. Wind rose at some selected pressure levels were shown in Figs. 7 - 10. In general, the wind is strong in winter, especially in the stratosphere and NE-ly and SW-ly winds are predominant in the troposphere, SW-ly or W-ly in the stratosphere. The E-ly winds were also observed above 30 mb in summer. C. Ozone observation: i) Total ozone observation Dobson ozone spectrophotometer was used for this observation. Table 3 shows the results of only direct sunlight observation with reliable AD wave length setting. Comparison is made in Figs. 11 and 12 between Syowa Base, Little America and Halley Bay. Total ozone amount can be said to increase in spring from November to December over the Antarctic and the maximum seems to appear in summer. The 10 -days average values of Syowa Base and Halley Bay show to be in good similarity in spite of different year. It may also be noted that a good correlation exists between rapid increase of ozone amount and temperature of 50 mb in late November. ii) Surface ozone observation The density of surface ozone was measured on days without drifting snow from the end of February 1961. Based on Ehmert method, the equipment developed by Mr. KAWAMURA, Meteorological Research Institute, was used. It may be seen that the density increase in autumn and reaches its maximum value about 40 μg/m^ 3 in early June in polar night season, then decreases rapidly until the sun comes back and indicates minimum in early summer. It should be noted that there is 6 months 2 ̆ 7 phase difference between the surface ozone amount and the total ozone amount. D. Special observation: Snow accumulation Toward ENE-ly direction from the base, 6 <b>snow</b> <b>stakes</b> were erected and snow accumulation was observed several times every month. The result is shown in Table 4 in which the annual accumulation was 121 cm. Average density of snow was 0. 474 and the equivalent amount of water was 574 m/m...|$|R

His twelve opponents included Romsdal, <b>Snow</b> Sky (Gordon <b>Stakes)</b> and Hartnell (Queen's Vase). Atzeni restrained the colt towards the rear of the field before moving up on the outside to make his challenge in the straight. He made rapid progress {{to take the lead in}} the closing stages and won from Romsdal and Snow Sky. Kingston Hill hung left towards the rail as he made his challenge and appeared to impede the run of Snow Sky, but after a stewards' inquiry the result remained unaltered. Atzeni said [...] "I rode him like the best horse in the race. He travelled brilliant and he is so laid back he just goes to sleep. When I pulled him out he was always going to get there." [...] Varian, who, like Atzeni, was winning his first classic, indicated that the colt could now be aimed at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.|$|R
40|$|Since Vostok Station {{was opened}} in December 1957, {{a number of}} snow {{accumulation}} studies {{have been carried out}} using various methods such as stratigraphic observations in snow pits, absolute snow dating based on geochemical analyses of snow samples, and measurements of <b>snow</b> build-up at <b>stakes.</b> During the first 12 years, the mass-balance studies at Vostok were mainly limited to observations of stratigraphic features in a few shallow pits. It was not until January 1970, when a snow accumulation-stake network was set up, that systematic observations of snow surface build-up and density began. The data obtained from those stakes allowed investigation of the role of snow surface topography in spatial and temporal variability of snow accumulation. At the same time, the development of the stratigraphic observation technique in the conditions of extreme low accumulation rate of t he Antarctic plateau, made it possible to obtain reliable values of snow mass-balance from pits. An extensive program of stratigraphic studies launched in 1998 allowed to recover the snow accumulation rates in Vostok’s vicinity for the last 60 years. The use of data from three deep (10 – 12 m) pits and several shallow cores recently lead to reconstruction of mass-balance history over the pas...|$|R

40|$|Predictions {{concerning}} Antarctica’s {{contribution to}} sea level change have been hampered by poor knowledge of surface mass balance. Snow accumulation {{is the most}} direct climate indicator and {{has important implications for}} palaeoclimatic reconstruction from ice cores. <b>Snow</b> accumulation measurements (<b>stake,</b> core, <b>snow</b> radar) taken along a 500 km transect crossing Talos Dome (East Antarctica) have been used to assess accumulation signals and the representativeness of ice core records. Stake readings show that accumulation hiatuses can occur at sites with accumulation rates below 120 kg m- 2 yr- 1. Differences between cores and stakes can lead to statistical misidentification of annual layers determined from seasonal signals at sites with accumulation rates below 200 kg m- 2 yr- 1 due to non-detection of higher and lower values. Achieving ± 10 % accuracy in the reconstruction of snow accumulation from single cores requires high accumulation (750 kg m- 2 yr- 1). Low-accumulation sites are representative if cumulative rates computed over several years are used to reach the 750 kg m- 2 yr- 1 threshold. Temporal variability of accumulation over the last two centuries shows no significant increase in accumulation. Wind-driven processes are a fundamental component of surface mass balance. Spatial variations in accumulation are well correlated with surface slope changes along the wind direction and may exceed 200 kg m- 2 yr- 1 within one kilometer. Wind-driven sublimation rates are less than 50 kg m- 2 yr- 1 in plateau areas and up to 260 kg m- 2 yr- 1 in slope areas and account for 20 - 75 % of precipitation, whereas depositional features are negligible in surface mass balance...|$|R
40|$|COMInternational audienceSince 2008, {{mass balance}} is {{measured}} on the Austre Lovénbreen (Spitsbergen, Norway, 79 N) {{as part of}} the Hydro-Sensor-FlOWS program. The observations are made at a very fine scale: on the 4. 5 km 2 glacier, mass balance is measured each September with 36 <b>stakes.</b> <b>Snow</b> cover is measured at the end of April. 20 air-temperature loggers give hourly data on the thermal state of the glacier. In addition automatic cameras provide 3 pictures per day. These pictures are used to determine whether ice is visible or snow covered all over the glacier. Climate parameters provided by the nearby Ny-Alesund weather station are also used. The influence of climatic parameters on mass balance has been explored. Over the last five years, Austre Lovénbreen's mean mass balance is - 17 cm. Four of the five years are between - 9 and - 26 cm. One year (2010 - 2011) clearly stands out with a value of - 123 cm corresponding to a very important ablation on the entire glacier. There is no clear correlation between mass balance values and yearly cli- matic parameters. Seasonal variations seem to explain more. High temperatures and consequent liquid precipitation are partially explaining mass balance results. A "warm" winter with important precipitation (like in January 2012) will give rain at sea level but huge amounts of snow on the glacier at higher altitude (100 - 550 masl). A hot summer will result in important ablation, even more so if it is rainy too. The five-year survey also shows the importance of short-term warm and rainy events. Strong events can account for an important part of a year's mass balance. Considering the longest mass balance series of the neighbouring glacier (Midtre Lovénbreen), we will also discuss the relationship between mass balance and the North Atlantic Oscillation or the Arctic Oscillation...|$|R
