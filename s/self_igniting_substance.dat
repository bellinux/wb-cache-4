50|$|Methods of {{ignition}} include pyrotechnic, electrical (spark or hot wire), and chemical. Hypergolic propellants {{have the}} advantage of <b>self</b> <b>igniting,</b> reliably and with less chance of hard starts. In the 1940s, the Russians began to start engines with hypergolic fuel, then switch over to the primary propellants after ignition. This was also used on the American F-1 rocket engine on the Apollo program.|$|R

It is already being used in some areas for heating and energy generation. It is nontoxic, but must be stored under pressure. Larger hydrocarbons and ethanol can also be produced from carbon dioxide and hydrogen.|$|R
2500|$|The {{portable}} cheirosiphōn ("hand-siphōn"), {{the earliest}} analogue {{to a modern}} flamethrower, is extensively attested in the military documents of the 10th century, and recommended for use in both sea and land. They first appear in the Tactica of emperor Leo VI the Wise, {{who claims to have}} invented them. Subsequent authors continued to refer to the cheirosiphōnes, especially for use against siege towers, although Nikephoros II Phokas also advises their use in field armies, with the aim of disrupting the enemy formation. Although both Leo VI and Nikephoros Phokas claim that the substance used in the cheirosiphōnes was the same as in the static devices used on ships, Haldon and Byrne consider that the former were manifestly different from their larger cousins, and theorize that the device was fundamentally different, [...] "a simple syringe [...] squirted both liquid fire (presumably unignited) and noxious juices to repel enemy troops." [...] The illustrations of Hero's Poliorcetica show the cheirosiphōn also throwing the <b>ignited</b> <b>substance,</b> [...] but such illustrations were narrative in intent, so that showing the device throwing the <b>ignited</b> <b>substance</b> may have seemed preferable to trying to clearly illustrate throwing the unignited <b>substance</b> and then <b>igniting</b> it.|$|R
50|$|Ignition of a {{thermite}} reaction normally requires a sparkler or easily obtainable magnesium ribbon, but may require persistent efforts, as ignition can be unreliable and unpredictable. These temperatures cannot be reached with conventional black powder fuses, nitrocellulose rods, detonators, pyrotechnic initiators, or other common <b>igniting</b> <b>substances.</b> Even when the thermite is {{hot enough to}} glow bright red, it will not ignite as it must be at or near white-hot to initiate the reaction. It is possible to start the reaction using a propane torch if done correctly.|$|R

30|$|The {{crossing}} point method of Jones requires {{the measurement of}} the temperature difference between the centre temperature and the oven temperature (Wang et al. 2006), as measured near the sample’s surface. Worden implemented Jones’ method to determine the global kinetic parameters of the cotton impregnated with boiled linseed oil (Worden 2011). At low oven temperatures, the {{crossing point}} temperature derived by Chen’s method approximates that obtained by Jones’ method (Chen 1999). However, the two temperatures diverge as the oven temperature increases. From a theoretical perspective, Chen’s method yields fundamental kinetic parameters, provided that the first order kinetic rate model holds. On the other hand, Jones’ method results in estimates of apparent kinetic parameters that nonetheless could be useful for ranking materials for their tendency to <b>self</b> <b>ignite</b> (Chen 1999). See Appendix for the derivation of both methods and more complete discussion of their limitations.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} is {{presented}} a way {{to contribute to the}} environmental protection when it comes to coal which waits in big deposits to be burned for energy production. Because of certain parameters, in some places, the deposited coal could overheat and <b>self</b> <b>ignite,</b> thus loosing its caloric properties and even lead to fire. In this case the losses could be even higher, and the effect on the environment even worse. In order to prevent this self ignition to happen, an infrared camera can be mounted on a system, and the camera together with software which interprets the thermographic images, can alarm the personnel who is in charge with coal surveillance that the coal will ignite unless they take immediate measures. Also, there will be presented the limits we have found by now in the way of finalizing the application. environmental protection, coal deposits, lignite, oxidized, coal, carbon monoxide...|$|R
40|$|Research {{has been}} {{conducted}} on ignition of natural gas as a potential replacement for fossil fuels. A reason natural gas is not widely used and adapted {{is because of the}} harmful emissions created when combusted in rich mixtures, but if the gas can be burned at a lean or ultra-lean equivalence ratio, these emissions can be reduced or even eliminated. One method of burning lean and ultra-lean substances is by use of hot-jet ignition. This method <b>ignites</b> the <b>substance</b> near its combustion temperature, reducing the harmful emissions. This method is not yet fully understood, and so research must be done to analyze the hot-jet itself and how it ignites or fails to <b>ignite</b> the <b>substance.</b> For measuring ignition, the main chamber and prechamber are filled with methane-air mixtures with varying conditions. Next the prechamber is ignited using a spark plug that then creates a hot-jet of these combustion products to penetrate into the main chamber. The improved system will use a modified Schlieren method to observe the phenomenon, and an IR Diagnostics system to record images and temperatures. Using these procedures and recording if ignition happened or not, a basis can be determined for creating conditions optimal for <b>igniting</b> lean <b>substances.</b> Ignition in the main chamber is dependent upon the characteristics of the penetrating hot-jet as well as the static characteristics of the main chamber gas. The key characteristics that have the greatest effect upon ignition are best recorded using the new system; giving a full range of information required...|$|R

50|$|On 29 July 1940, {{manufacturers}} Albright & Wilson of Oldbury {{demonstrated to}} the Royal Air Force how their white phosphorus {{could be used}} to ignite incendiary bombs. The demonstration involved throwing glass bottles containing a mixture of petrol and phosphorus at pieces of wood and into a hut. On breaking, the phosphorus was exposed to the air and spontaneously ignited; the petrol also burned resulting in a fierce fire. Because of safety concerns, the RAF was not interested in white phosphorus as a source of ignition, but the idea of a self-igniting petrol bomb took hold. Initially known as an A.W. bomb, it was officially named the No 76 Grenade, but more commonly known as the SIP (<b>Self</b> <b>Igniting</b> Phosphorus) grenade. The perfected list of ingredients was white phosphorus, benzene, water and a two-inch strip of raw rubber; all in a half-pint bottle sealed with a crown stopper. Over time, the rubber would slowly dissolve making the contents slightly sticky and the mixture would separate into two layers - this was intentional and the grenade should not be shaken to mix the layers as this would only delay ignition. When thrown against a hard surface, the glass would shatter and the contents would instantly ignite liberating choking fumes of phosphorus pentoxide and sulphur dioxide as well as producing a great deal of heat.|$|R

5000|$|During the 1950s and 1960s {{there was}} a great burst of {{activity}} by propellant chemists to find high-energy liquid and solid propellants better suited to the military. Large strategic missiles need to sit in land-based or submarine-based silos for many years, able to launch at a moment's notice. Propellants requiring continuous refrigeration, which cause their rockets to grow ever-thicker blankets of ice, were not practical. As the military was willing to handle and use hazardous materials, a great number of dangerous chemicals were brewed up in large batches, most of which wound up being deemed unsuitable for operational systems. In the case of nitric acid, the acid itself (HNO3) was unstable, and corroded most metals, making it difficult to store. The addition of a modest amount of nitrogen tetroxide, N2O4, turned the mixture red and kept it from changing composition, but left the problem that nitric acid corrodes containers it is placed in, releasing gases that can build up pressure in the process. The breakthrough was the addition of a little hydrogen fluoride (HF), which forms a self-sealing metal fluoride on the interior of tank walls that Inhibited Red Fuming Nitric Acid. This made [...] "IRFNA" [...] storeable. Propellant combinations based on IRFNA or pure N2O4 as oxidizer and kerosene or hypergolic (<b>self</b> <b>igniting)</b> aniline, hydrazine or unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) as fuel were then adopted in the United States and the Soviet Union for use in strategic and tactical missiles. The self-igniting storeable liquid bi-propellants have somewhat lower specific impulse than LOX/kerosene but have higher density so a greater mass of propellant can be placed in the same sized tanks.Gasoline was replaced by different hydrocarbon fuels, for example RP-1 - a highly refined grade of kerosene. This combination is quite practical for rockets that need not be stored. , it is used in the first stages of many orbital launchers.|$|R

However, there is one gameplay element that players should be aware of: using a form's innate abilities drains energy from Ben's Omnitrix meter, preventing them from continually being used until the meter can recharge. As a result, players will {{need to focus on}} combos and save their special attacks for finishing blows instead of constantly wielding them in battle.|$|R

40|$|Three {{steady state}} {{combustion}} models, two turbulence models {{and a model}} for tK' 6 prediction of NO., were implemented and investigated on a simple backward facing step experiment {{as well as an}} experimental lean prevaporised premixed (LPP) combustor. The three combustion models included the simple Eddy Break-up model as well as a presumed probability density function (pdf) model and a form of the BML crossing frequency flamelet model. These models were adapted to consider a variable mixture fraction to account for a non-homogeneous fuel air mixture. The two turbulence models used were the k-e and second moment models. Despite being unable to capture the flame front spreading {{in the case of the}} backward facing step, these predictions provided insight into the performance and implementation of the models. All three of the combustion models, after appropriate tuning, worked well for the LPP test combustor. This illustrates that such time averaged models are useful for flows which do not contain large transient coherent structures, such as that of the LPP test combustor and most practical engine combustors designed today. The second moment closure turbulence model was found to have the greatest impact on the flame front through the flow field predictions rather than through counter gradient diffusion. The Eddy Break-up and BML crossing frequency models both performed very well, qualitatively predicting the correct trends. The additional consideration of flame front straining in the BML crossing frequency model did not appear to significantly influence the flame front. This is because the type of model adopted to predict this effect had a relatively uniform influence everywhere in the flow. The presumed pdf model also performed well and was additionally found to <b>self</b> <b>ignite</b> without the existence of hot products when the inlet temperature was high enough. The NO., model faired well for a simple experimental geometry. However, it considerably over predicted the NO., formed within the LIPP test combustor, which was most probably due to poor boundary conditions. Despite this overprediction, the results give insight into how to improve the NQ, emissions for the experimental combustor...|$|R

[...] Combustion occurred in more than two thirds of simulated head-on collisions. The engineers also noticed etching on the windshield caused by the corrosive gases. BMW, and VW-Audi agreed with Mercedes and left the SAE R-1234yf CRP Team, stating that the performed tests are not sufficient to fully judge the safety of their vehicles. The German automakers have been leaning towards carbon dioxide refrigerant, which may be safer for both passengers and the environment.|$|R

The Army FRF program ended in 1987 without fielding this fire resistant fuel formulation. There were both technical and logistical reasons for this. Unconventional warfare experienced in Iraq and Afghanistan involving use of Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) has led the Army to restart the FRF program {{in an attempt to}} counter the increasing threat of fuel fires.

40|$|A {{simple method}} was {{developed}} to determine the relative particle foliar flammability and heat content of forest fuels. The apparatus used {{was similar to the}} one described by the 79 / 831 European Commission Directive for measuring the relative self-ignition temperature (minimum ambient temperature at which a certain volume of a <b>substance</b> <b>ignites</b> under defined conditions). The forest materials examined were: Cupressus sempervirens (Italian cypress), Olea europaea (Olive tree), Pinus brutia (Calabrian pine), Pinus halepensis (Aleppo pine), Pistacia lentiscus (Mastic tree), Quercus coccifera (Holly oak). These species are very common in the Mediterranean region and frequently devastated by forest fires. The relative data determined (self-ignition temperature, ignition delay times, combustion duration, etc.) provide a simple screening test on the fire hazard properties of forest species, which could be used for comparison purposes. Among the forest species examined, Pinus brutia had the highest relative ignition temperature and the longest ignition delay time, while Pistacia lentiscus had the lowest and shortest ones. Also, Quercus coccifera and Pistacia lentiscus had the highest heat content and Olea europaea the lowest one. Finally, Cupressus sempervirens was the most combustible and Pinus halepensis the most sustainable fuel. (C) 2005 Elsevier B. V All rights reserved...|$|R
