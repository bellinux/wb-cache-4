40|$|INTRODUCTION Naturally {{occurring}} fiber-reinforced composites like wood {{have been}} used for a long time. Wood differs from other construction materials because it is produced in a living tree. The mechanical properties (strength and stiffness) of the biological material wood differ very and depend {{on the quality of the}} tree, the humidity etc. It is necessary to grade the sawn lumber in different classes. In Austria exists visual and mechanical <b>stress</b> <b>graded</b> timber. There are three classes for visual graded timber (S 7, S 10, S 13) and four classes for mechanical <b>stress</b> <b>graded</b> timber (MS 7, MS 10, MS 13, MS 17). For glued-laminated timber beams (glulam-beams) four types are classified: BS 11, BS 14, BS 16 and BS 18. The beams consist of one class of lamination or are combinated of different classes of laminations. The combinated glulam beams are reinforced in the tension and/or pressure zones with timber of a higher quality. It is also possible to reinforce timber beams with steel or fi...|$|R

40|$|High-power voltage sourced converters(VSC’s) are {{becoming}} increasingly prevalent in modern transmission systems. These systems primarily use switching schemes generating kHz range harmonics, which may be magnified {{by one or more}} system resonances. Despite the high frequency harmonics, VSC systems widely use insulated equipment designed for operation at power frequencies; this includes critical substation components such as medium voltage polymeric cables and terminations. The <b>stress</b> <b>grading</b> systems of non-geometric (compact) cable terminations are susceptible to insulation degradation and eventual flashover failure, under high frequency harmonic stresses. As such, the present work studies high frequency voltage effects in cross-linked polyethylene cable terminations, and their relationship to <b>stress</b> <b>grading</b> (SG) design and material properties. Finite element modeling (FEM) has been used to analyze electric field and resistive heating in termination designs, in response to parametric variations in SG material properties. Experimental studies investigate thermal behaviour in a variety of commercial termination designs, using a high voltage, high frequency test setup developed to replicate conditions of high frequency harmonic resonance in a VSC system. The study results show that high frequency voltage application increases the electric field, resistive heating, and surface temperature rise, in non-geometric (compact) termination designs using field-dependant <b>stress</b> <b>grading</b> materials. Geometric (stress cone) designs are insensitive to high frequency harmonics; however, they have disadvantages compared to compact designs, making them a less practical long-term solution for high frequency applications. Among non-geometric designs, the field-dependent electrical conductivity σ (E), the permittivity ε, and the temperature dependencies of σ (E) and ε strongly influence the termination electrical and thermal behaviour under high frequency stress. Since thermal hotspots in cable termination SG areas may lead to material degradation and eventual failure, recommendations are made for an optimal non-geometric <b>stress</b> <b>grading</b> design, for terminations operating in environments where high frequency harmonics may be present...|$|E

The analyses were {{based on data from}} three sawing studies on Norway spruce, a total of 1095 logs from 22 different stands, and one sawing study on Scots pine. Logistic regression was used as the classification method, and model accuracy was assessed using the areas under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.

The 210 samples were prepared from 15 -year-old trees of Acacia mangium from the Forest Estate Plantation, Indonesia. Specimens were 20 ® × 20 (T) × 500 [*]mm (L) and were air-dried. Sixty samples were tested under four-point bending stress to obtain the modulus of elasticity (MOE) and the modulus of rupture (MOR) for classifying the <b>stress</b> <b>grades</b> of the remaining 150 samples. The tests were performed using a four-point load bending position at various stress level while the specimens were exposed to fire along the shear-free region. Time to failure was affected by the stress levels in an exponential trend. Despite changes in stress level, charring rate, and time to failure, the critical stress of a member from the same species was similar. The fire performance under applied load could be predicted by using simplified fire-testing methods. The developed testing apparatus is valid for evaluating the small-scale fire resistant behavior of structural lumber in bending.|$|R

A focus of the stress study is on {{the investigation of the}} acoustic factors which contribute to the perception of stress level. This study examined all possible acoustic/physiological cues to stress based on data from Annotated Chinese Speech Corpus and proposed that times of vibration of vocal folds (TVVF) reflects stress level best. It is traditionally held that pitch and duration are the most important acoustic parameters to stress. But for Chinese which is a tone language and features special strong-weak pattern in prosody, these two parameters might not be the best ones to represent stress degree. This paper proposed that TVVF, reflected as the number of wave pulses of the vocalic part of a syllable, is the ideal parameter to stress level. Since number of pulses is the integral of pitch and duration (Pulse=∫f(pitch) dt), TVVF can embody the effect of stress on both pitch and duration. The analyses revealed that TVVF is most correlated with the <b>grades</b> of <b>stress.</b> Therefore, it can be a more effective parameter indicating stress level. most correlated.

Statistical analysis of linear regression with a dummy model and analysis of covariance were used to analyze the role of MOE and the effect of species on prediction of MOR.

The accuracy of prediction would be increased with species identification. An allowable stress and reference resistance for species and/or groups of species were provided to compare with the prediction of strength through timber grading.
