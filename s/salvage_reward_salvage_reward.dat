50|$|Mr Justice Hill criticised the Admiralty for not {{allowing}} Captain Calderwood {{to return to}} his ship at the earliest opportunity. Addressing the question of the ship being looted, he laid the blame squarely on the crew of Bittern as only men from that ship had been aboard Clan Sutherland the whole time she was under salvage. Irving was criticised for not exercising proper control over his crew or exercising due diligence in preventing or detecting the thefts. As punishment, he ordered that the crew of Bittern forfeit their <b>salvage</b> <b>reward,</b> {{regardless of whether or not}} they had been involved in the looting. Although Lieutenant Irving was cleared of any involvement in the looting, his reward was cut to £100.|$|R
5000|$|Following on {{from the}} {{innovations}} of the LOF 1980, the 1989 International <b>Salvage</b> Convention permitted <b>salvage</b> <b>rewards</b> {{to be made to}} salvors who acted to limit damage to the coastal environment after oil spills. Articles 13 & 14 of the Convention made provision for [...] "Special Compensation", but the UK House of Lords case of the Nagasaki Spirit [...] revealed that the Convention had been poorly drafted, thereby limiting the amount that environmental salvors could be paid to mere [...] "out-of-pocket expenses", with no allowance for any profit margin. As an antidote to this, the marine insurance industry and P&I Clubs jointly developed the [...] "SCOPIC clause", which is a codicil that may be appended to an LOF and invoked should the statutory payment provisions prove inadequate. The first SCOPIC clause was in 2000, and there have been several iterations since.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the {{previous}} Red Faction game, which used the Geomod engine, Guerrilla {{does not allow}} for the destruction of terrain. [...] However the game's Geomod 2.0 engine allows for buildings, cover, and other structures to be destroyed. This allows a degree of creativity in approaching a given objective, such as breaking or crashing through structures, or leveling multi-story buildings and large bridges or catwalks to thwart the enemy. In many cases, destroying buildings will leave behind salvage, the game's form of currency, which can be used along with <b>salvage</b> <b>rewarded</b> by completing missions to unlock and upgrade weaponry and technology at safehouses. During the campaign, the player is always equipped with a sledgehammer-like weapon, along with three slots for other weapons and explosives, selected out of a choice of almost twenty items. The player also has the opportunity to control armed vehicles ranging from retrofitted civilian vehicles up to tanks and large walkers for more destructive options against the EDF.|$|R
50|$|A winger, Salvage {{began his}} career at Athenian League Division Two side Eastbourne United. He won {{promotion}} to Division One in 1967 and departed the club in September that year. In July 1987, 20 years after his departure, <b>Salvage</b> was <b>rewarded</b> with a testimonial against Fulham.|$|R
2500|$|Property law, {{admiralty}} {{law and the}} law of the sea may be of relevance when lost, mislaid, and abandoned property is found at sea. <b>Salvage</b> law <b>rewards</b> salvors for risking life and property to rescue the property of another from peril. On land the distinction between deliberate and accidental loss led to the concept of a [...] "treasure trove". In the United Kingdom, shipwrecked goods should be reported to a Receiver of Wreck, and if identifiable, they should be returned to their rightful owner.|$|R
40|$|Marine salvage is a {{fascinating}} area of the maritime industry and involves aspects that are unique compared to similar undertakings ashore. It is different because ashore there are rescue services available at any time, such as the local fire department. At sea {{there is no guarantee}} that help will reach a vessel in distress. Weather conditions can be extreme with no possibility for shelter. Professional salvage is highly specialized and can be a very hazardous undertaking. The salvage award paid out to the salvor is often very generous and much more than normal pay for work performed. A <b>salvage</b> <b>reward</b> is based on the salved values and other criteria such as the skill and efforts of the salvor. The reward is meant as an incentive for a salvor, and for the existence of professional salvage companies. The rules regulating salvage are also unique and reflect the specialized nature of marine salvage. Several parties are involved in a salvage operation, mainly the shipowner, the salvage company and the insurers. There are of course others, such as the national government of the country where the operation takes place, environmental organizations or providers of equipment. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the marine insurers' involvement in a salvage operation and what kind of cooperation there is between the insurers and the other parties, mainly the shipowner and the salvage company. At the same time this thesis aims to find out whether the marine insurers involvement in salvage is described by the law. I. e. the objective is to compare information in the legal sources of marine salvage and insurance with the practical work undertaken by the insurers, including the cooperation taking place between the insurers and other parties. What information is possible to derive from the law? What do the parties actually do? What goes on “behind the scenes”? What does the law tell us and how are things actually done in the practical world? One main research question: Is the cooperation taking place between the insurer and the salvor described by the law...|$|R
40|$|Free flap {{transfer}} for {{soft tissue}} defects involving {{the sole of}} the foot have been important in limb salvage. The functional capacity of 16 patients is documented. From our data, free flaps to weightbearing surfaces of the foot give satisfactory results in patients less than 40 years old and <b>salvage</b> is <b>rewarding.</b> Older patients had less than satisfactory results. When the only alternative is an am-putation, free flap salvage may still be indicated. Free flap transfer for soft tissue defects involving weightbearing areas of the foot have been important in salvaging limbs that would have otherwise undergone amputation. The functional capacity of patients with free flap transfers has not been previously recorded. This study undertakes an evaluation of their postoper-ative results...|$|R
50|$|Mech {{customization}} {{is a major}} {{aspect of}} gameplay. The player has significant control over the configuration of each {{of his or her}} Mechs, from the type and amount of armor used and some internal components to all of the Mech's weaponry and ammunition. In the campaign, additional parts, weapons, and ammunition are acquired through the missions from <b>salvage</b> and as <b>rewards</b> for success. The Mech configuration system has been simplified from that seen in MechWarrior 2 and MechWarrior 3.|$|R
5000|$|When {{property}} is {{lost at sea}} and rescued by another, the rescuer is entitled to claim a salvage award on the salved property. There is no [...] "life salvage". All mariners {{have a duty to}} save the lives of others in peril without expectation of <b>reward.</b> Consequently, <b>salvage</b> law applies only to the saving of property.|$|R
6000|$|They {{went out}} and the {{merchant}} gave Barbara an approving smile. [...] "I imagine they haven't at the moment much use for the tug, which accounts for their being {{willing to take a}} moderate sum. All the same, you handled the situation like a good business man. Had they known much about your plans before we agreed, they would have sent the tug and claimed a large <b>reward</b> for <b>salvage.</b> In fact, it looks as if you had saved Mr. Cartwright--" ...|$|R
50|$|The various parties {{involved}} in the saving of Clan Sutherland put in their claims for <b>rewards</b> under <b>salvage</b> rules. Following a Court of Admiralty case concluded on 31 July 1918, Mr Justice Hill awarded £6,000 to the Admiralty, which had coordinated the operation. The crew of Boarhound were awarded £500 to be divided between them. The crews of Lois and Woonda were awarded £360. The crew of Fortitude were awarded £300. Lieutenant Irving of Bittern was awarded £300. Captain Edwards of Lois was awarded £200. The crew of Bittern were awarded £900 to be divided between her then 72-man complement (£12 10s each).|$|R
50|$|The {{right to}} be <b>rewarded</b> for <b>salvage</b> at sea under common law is based both on {{equitable}} principles and public policy and is not contractual in origin. Historically, salvage is a right in law, when a person, acting as a volunteer (that is, without any pre-existing contractual or other legal duty so to act) preserves or contributes so to preserving at sea any vessel, cargo, freight, or other recognized subject of salvage from danger. This is the typical case of salvage and is distinct from Prize law, which is the rescuing of property from the enemy {{at a time of}} war, for which a reward is made by the Court of Admiralty sitting as a Prize Court.|$|R
5000|$|The Brussels Convention {{established}} {{the principle that}} a salvor is only <b>rewarded</b> if the <b>salvage</b> operation successfully rescues the ship or its cargo. The International Convention on Salvage expanded on this principle by introducing {{the concept of an}} [...] "enhanced salvage award", which may be awarded by an arbitrator or a tribunal if the salvor took effective action to prevent or minimize environmental damage but nevertheless failed to salvage the ship or its cargo.|$|R
40|$|The Eleventh Amendment prohibits {{citizens}} from bringing actions in law or equity against individual states in federal courts. The Amendment {{does not address}} whether states are subject to federal jurisdiction for actions in admiralty in which both a shipwreck salvor and a state claim title to a shipwreck Analyzing applicable admiralty, federal, and common law {{in the context of}} Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence, this Note examines whether the states are subject to pure admiralty actions in federal court by citizen-salvors seeking either title to or <b>reward</b> for <b>salvaging</b> a shipwreck. The original intentions of admiralty law: rewarding salvors for their efforts, uniformity, and encouraging the recovery and preservation of shipwrecked property, are considered in answering this jurisdictional question. The Eleventh Amendment remains afloat to protect states from some admiralty actions, but there are circumstances in which federal courts should have jurisdiction over citizens and states competing for claim to shipwrecks...|$|R
