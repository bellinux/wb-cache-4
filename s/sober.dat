It was the first album Burnley wrote while {{completely}} <b>sober.</b> In 2007, Burnley experienced fatigue and phosphenes following three consecutive days of no sleep and heavy drinking, after which he decided to remain <b>sober.</b> Burnley acknowledged an improved clarity and coherence within Dear Agony due to his sobriety. The album cover features Burnley's brain scan, representing the recurrent themes on Dear Agony related to the singer's chronic illnesses caused by alcohol consumption.|$|E

In October 1952 he married Billie Jean Jones.|$|E

Both {{reported}} enjoying the occasion; Smith, a keen sports fan and a talented player in his day, fondly recounted his [...] "lovely day discussing the great men of cricket" [...] with <b>Sobers</b> in his memoirs, while <b>Sobers</b> recalled the Rhodesian premier as [...] "a tremendous person to talk to".

2500|$|Australia {{toured the}} West Indies in 1954–55, and their all-rounder Keith Miller thought that <b>Sobers</b> {{would become a}} better batsman than bowler despite batting in the lower-order. <b>Sobers</b> was not {{selected}} for the First Test, which the West Indies lost by nine wickets. However, he regained his place for the Second Test in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. The match was a high-scoring draw, with <b>Sobers</b> scoring 47 and eight not out. He was barely used with the ball, bowling three overs for ten runs, as Australia amassed a first-innings total of over 600. <b>Sobers</b> was given a further opportunity in the next Test in Georgetown, Guyana (British Guiana at the time) in South America. Despite scoring only 12 and 11 with the bat, he took three wickets in the Australians' first innings. Nevertheless, Australia won by eight wickets. West Indian captain and opening batsman Jeff Stollmeyer twisted his ankle after treading on a ball ahead of the Fourth Test in Barbados, [...] "triggering huge debate about who should open." [...] Eventually, <b>Sobers</b> was chosen to open the innings after Australia had amassed another total of over 600. <b>Sobers</b> had a suspicion he might be asked to do the job. [...] "I couldn't see them sending in anyone else — I was a bowler with a little ability as a batsman and they wanted someone to help see off the shine and protect the three W's." [...] <b>Sobers</b> struck his first three deliveries for boundaries, all from the bowling of Miller. In the fast-bowler's second over, <b>Sobers</b> hit him for another three fours. He was eventually dismissed for 43 out of a first-wicket partnership of 52 with JK Holt. The match was drawn, and <b>Sobers</b> took one wicket in the Australians' only innings, before scoring 11 in the West Indies second innings. The home team were again defeated in the Fifth and final Test in Jamaica. <b>Sobers</b> performed with the bat, however, scoring 35 not out and 64.|$|R
5|$|Advocates {{for higher}} levels of {{selection}} (such as Richard Lewontin, David Sloan Wilson, and Elliott <b>Sober)</b> {{suggest that there are}} many phenomena (including altruism) that gene-based selection cannot satisfactorily explain. The philosopher Mary Midgley, with whom Dawkins clashed in print concerning The Selfish Gene, has criticised gene selection, memetics, and sociobiology as being excessively reductionist; she has suggested that the popularity of Dawkins's work is due to factors in the Zeitgeist such as the increased individualism of the Thatcher/Reagan decades.|$|E

5|$|Chapman took up pipe smoking aged 15, which {{continued}} {{for the remainder}} of his life. He began drinking heavily during his time at Cambridge and St Bartholomew's, favouring gin.

5000|$|<b>Sobers</b> toured England {{for their}} summer in 1957. He played his first match against the Jim Swanton XI in April, and was {{surprised}} about how cold the conditions were, often causing him to wear two or three jumpers.His performances with the bat throughout the five Test series were classed as mediocre, scoring 320 runs at 32, with three half centuries. On the bowling front, <b>Sobers</b> struggled, taking five wickets at 71. It was in the final Test at The Oval that <b>Sobers</b> gained the attention of critics with defiant batting amid a disappointing team performance. The condition of the pitch was subject to criticism and described by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as [...] "a strange sight". After England had scored 412, the West Indies were easily dismissed for 89 and 86 by the Surrey spinners Jim Laker and Tony Lock, who were playing on their home ground. Batting at number 3, <b>Sobers</b> made 39 and 42, while none of his colleagues passed 30 in either innings. In its summary of the tour, Wisden said: [...] "(of the newcomers) Collie Smith, <b>Sobers,</b> Rohan Kanhai and Roy Gilchrist were particularly impressive"; adding that [...] "to <b>Sobers,</b> a tall left-handed all-rounder, fell the distinction of hitting the highest score of the tour: 219 not out against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge. <b>Sobers</b> undoubtedly was a very fine stroke-player who should go far".|$|R
5|$|The 1969 {{tour was}} a three Test series. The captains were Ray Illingworth for England and <b>Sobers</b> for the West Indies. The West Indies had an ageing team and, with <b>Sobers</b> {{suffering}} {{a loss of}} form, were always the weaker side.|$|R

5|$|According to the story, {{unaware of}} the nature of the gift, Norton saved the cigar, keeping it on display in his college's museum.

The honor was given to Winstead Norton, Horace's grandson. During the <b>sober</b> speech he was presenting, Winstead lit the cigar, and after two puffs, it exploded.

5|$|The crisis deepened on 10 October 1970, when Guyanese Prime Minister Forbes Burnham {{announced}} that <b>Sobers</b> {{would not be}} allowed to enter Guyana until he apologised. This was a major issue for the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) as the team played at least one Test match a year in Georgetown, the Guyanese capital.

Cancelling matches in Guyana might prompt Burnham to instruct Guyanese members of the West Indian team to boycott, and sacking <b>Sobers</b> might cause Barbados to withdraw in protest; either way, the unity of the West Indies team was threatened.
