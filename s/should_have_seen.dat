500|$|According to the City of Vancouver Public Art Registry, Gate to the Northwest Passage {{initially}} {{received an}} adverse reaction from local residents. Michael Duncan, then chief {{curator of the}} Vancouver Maritime Museum, called it [...] "a bloody monstrosity". One member of the five-person jury responded to the criticism: [...] "If people think Hung's sculpture is a poor catch, they <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> the ones that got away." ...|$|E

500|$|Altgens {{described}} {{what he saw}} following the fatal shot to JFK. [...] "There was no blood {{on the right-hand side}} of his face; there was no blood on the front of his face. But there was a tremendous amount of blood on the left-hand side and {{at the back of the}} head." [...] This suggested to Altgens that the gunshots came from the rear, because he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> some evidence otherwise. He also remembered seeing Jackie Kennedy on the trunk of the limousine, and thinking that she was frightened by the events and was trying to get away.|$|E

We therefore shake our heads and say 'Ah! You <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> Grimaldi!'" [...] Another writer commented that his performances elevated his role by [...] "acute observation upon the foibles and absurdities of society. ... He is the finest practical satyrist that ever existed. ... He was so extravagantly natural, that [...] ashamed to laugh till tears coursed down their cheeks at Joe and his comicalities." [...] The British dramatist James Planché worried, in a rhymed couplet, that Grimaldi's death meant {{the end of a}} genre: [...] "Pantomime's best days are fled; Grimaldi, Barnes, Bologna dead!" ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2014, Lamont and Scottish Labour faced {{criticism}} {{after the}} party voted against an SNP motion that included the introduction of free school meals for pupils in their {{first three years of}} primary education, and a commitment to childcare for pre-school children. The motion also contained measures that would only be implemented in the event of Scottish independence, something Labour said it could not support. Recalling her experience of teaching underprivileged children, Lamont told the parliament that free school meals would not be her priority, and tabled an unsuccessful amendment calling for greater childcare provisions instead. The motion was later passed by a majority of 67–46. In The Daily Telegraph, Cochrane wrote that the strategy had allowed the SNP to claim Labour opposed the principle of free school meals because they [...] "fell for a bit of skulduggery that Ms Lamont and her business managers <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> coming a mile off".|$|E
500|$|In 1967, {{the episode}} was {{received}} positively {{by members of}} the voice cast and their families, who had attended a preview screening at Century 21 Studios. Francis Matthews, who provided the voice of Captain Scarlet, recalls that [...] "the moment we heard, 'This is the voice of the Mysterons,' my eldest son ran screaming from the room, but my other son just sat there riveted," [...] and adds, [...] "Reg [...] said, 'Oh my God, what have we done? We've made a series that no children are going to watch!'" [...] The episode was given a cinematic presentation at the Columbia Theatre on London's Shaftesbury Avenue, which Gary Files, a voice actor for later Captain Scarlet episodes, warmly remembers: [...] "I looked at [...] with total and utter amazement... Boy, you <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> it on the wide screen! They had laid in an incredible soundtrack to go with it... We all tottered out into the night, convinced that we were on to a winner." [...] In his DVD commentary, Gerry Anderson praised Saunders' direction.|$|E

500|$|In the 2013 {{video game}} , a prequel to the Arkham series, {{there are several}} {{references}} to The Killing Joke. When Batman enters a carnival-esque room, Joker tells him he got {{a great deal on}} an out-of-service amusement park, [...] "You <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> the look on the real estate agent's face when we shook hands on the deal!", alluding to Joker's conning a theme park entrepreneur into granting him the rights of a run-down amusement park early in the graphic novel and then proceeding to murder him via Joker toxin. In a level featuring a psychiatric interview with Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Joker is playable as the Red Hood, walking through the chemical plant that will end with him becoming the Joker, as well as earlier beating up several patrons at a Comedy Club due to very poor reception towards a joke he made. The name of the achievement for defeating the Joker in the ending of the game [...] "Perhaps sooner, perhaps later" [...] was a reference to Batman's talk with [...] "Joker" [...] {{in the beginning of the}} graphic novel. While promoting the game, Troy Baker, who voices the Joker in the game, recites a monologue from the graphic novel.|$|E
500|$|Vidal's claim about a homoerotic subtext is hotly debated. Vidal {{first made}} the claim in an {{interview}} in the 1995 documentary film The Celluloid Closet, and asserted that he persuaded Wyler to direct Stephen Boyd to play the role {{as if he were a}} spurned homosexual lover. Vidal said that he believed that Messala's vindictiveness could only be motivated by the feeling of rejection that a lover would feel, and claimed to have suggested to Wyler that Stephen Boyd should play the role that way, and that Heston be kept in the dark about the Messala character's motivations. Whether Vidal wrote the scene in question or had the acting conversation with Wyler, and whether Wyler shot what Vidal wrote, remain issues of debate. Wyler himself said that he did not remember any conversation about this part of the script or Boyd's acting with Gore Vidal, and that he discarded Vidal's draft in favor of Fry's. Morgan Hudgens, publicity director for the film, however, wrote to Vidal in late May 1958 about the crucial scene, and implied there was a homosexual context: [...] "...the big cornpone [...] really threw himself into your 'first meeting' scene yesterday. You <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> those boys embrace!" [...] Film critic F. X. Feeney, in a comparison of script drafts, concludes that Vidal made significant and extensive contributions to the script.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were mostly mixed, calling the storyline [...] "a {{loudspeaker}} for political views." [...] Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote {{of the episode}}, [...] "I {{had a hard time}} listening to the characters spout out opinions, since none of them really made sense as character views and felt distinctly like the writers just wanted a place to dump their liberalisms – I don't want to only call out Seth MacFarlane because he didn't write this episode, but considering the little bit I know about the show's writer's room, it's pretty safe to assume he has final say on this sort of thing, especially given his 9/11 experience." [...] He also compared the A-story to the television series South Park, noting, [...] "It's very clear that South Park benefits from the short turnaround time between production and air, because it allows that show to comment very quickly on current events, and stay timely. Family Guy seems to do the exact opposite, waiting an extraordinarily long time to weigh in on a serious issue it doesn’t satirize for comedy." [...] He ended his review by commenting, [...] "After last week's bright spot, I knew we were headed back down for another helping of the usual misery, but this week offered neither a surprise nor an all-out failure, just expected, bland mediocrity." [...] He graded the episode as a C. In a much more positive review, Terren R. Moore of Ology, writing, [...] "It's just funny, and it's got a lot of ways of achieving that funniness, and it's definitely true that the show isn't always in its best form, but [...] "Thanksgiving" [...] shows that Family Guy refuses to be dead yet." [...] He also praised the episode for giving each character their own part in the episode, adding, [...] "while most of the story revolves around Joe, Kevin, and Peter, the three kids and Brian also get time in as well." [...] Moore also stated his enjoyment of the cultural references in the episode, stating, [...] "It's all good fun, and the cutaways are also top notch, including Peter's First Holiday and The Cowardly Lion as Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist. I nearly fell out when Peter described his probably-black coworker {{who turned out to be}} a white guy, which I <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> coming because it's very Family Guy, but still managed to get a laugh out of me." [...] He gave the episode a nine out of ten.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1970, Warner Bros. agreed to fund and {{distribute}} the film. The Harlem sequences were the first completed. Krantz intended to release these scenes as a 15-minute short in case the film's funding was pulled; Bakshi was nevertheless determined to complete the film as a feature. Late in November, Bakshi and Krantz screened a presentation reel for the studio with this sequence, pencil tests, and shots of Bakshi's storyboards. Bakshi stated, [...] "You <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> their faces in the screening room when I first screened a bit of Fritz. I'll remember their faces until I die.

2500|$|Lapierre and his {{department}} were criticised for their {{handling of the}} collapse of the carrier Jetsgo. [...] Critics said that he <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> warning signs after unsuccessful attempts to lower the carrier's costs. They also said that he had failed to warn the public or intervene, making him indirectly responsible when thousands of travelers were stranded when the carrier stopped operations. Lapierre rejected calls to resign, and denied that he had any knowledge of the collapse. He pointed out that most of the passengers had booked flights with credit cards and would be eligible for refunds.|$|E
2500|$|Jobs had {{difficulty}} functioning {{in a traditional}} classroom, tended to resist authority figures, frequently misbehaved and was suspended a few times.

[...] He frequently played pranks on others at Monta Loma Elementary school in Mountain View. His father Paul (who was abused as a child) never reprimanded him, however, and instead blamed the school for not placing enough challenge on his brilliant son.|$|E

His family is Jewish; his father's family was from Hungary and his mother's, originally surnamed [...] "Sklotkovick", were from Russia. When he was two years old, Spitz's family moved to Honolulu, Hawaii, where he swam at Waikiki beach every day. [...] "You <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> that little boy dash into the ocean. He'd run like he was trying to commit suicide," [...] Lenore Spitz told a reporter for Time in 1968. At age six, his family returned to Sacramento, California, and he began to compete at his local swim club. At age nine, he was training at Arden Hills Swim Club in Sacramento with swimming coach Sherm Chavoor, who mentored seven Olympic medal winners including Spitz.|$|E
2500|$|Cramer {{disagreed}} with Stewart {{on a few}} points, but mostly acknowledged {{that he could have}} done a better job foreseeing the economic collapse: [...] "We all <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> it more." [...] Not content with his explanation, Stewart showed videos in which Cramer recommended ways to drive down stock prices by spreading false rumors, deceiving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and deliberately misleading journalists. Cramer admitted that he can do better, and that he can change. He also pointed out the mass illusion on Wall Street and the finance industry in general that, in the words of former Merrill Lynch CEO Stanley O'Neal, [...] "fixed income and credit (i.e. the economy) were no longer cyclical in nature", and that this illusion had permeated Wall Street and all other industries connected to it, including the finance networks.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Leslie Moore on Tumblr, Cainon Lamb recalled how he started working on the Boyz II Men's sample and how his work reached Knowles. He said that he began working on [...] "Countdown" [...] during the night preceding the 2010 BET Awards. He was in the studio, listening to Boyz II Men's song, [...] "Uhh Ahh". He commented: [...] " [...] starts with a countdown of '10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1'. So I thought, 'Wow, that could be something. Just the countdown itself.'" [...] Once the countdown was in the computer, he slightly increased the pace at which it was played, added some snare drum taps to it, and started a beat. After that, he sent the song to his publisher, EMI Music. The latter {{was impressed with the}} instrumental and went on saying: [...] "I had a meeting this morning with Beyoncé and I played a couple other songs I had and she wasn't really feeling them. When I played the beat that you sent me, you <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> how she went crazy! She started dancing and bouncing up and down and just doing all kind of stuff. She loved that beat!" [...] On the request of his publisher, Lamb made [...] "a female version of the countdown part". Terius Nash wrote the verses and two days later, Knowles went in the studio and recorded it.|$|E
