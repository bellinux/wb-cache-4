5|$|There is some {{controversy}} over the actual location of the battle; according to <b>some,</b> <b>it</b> {{took place in the}} town itself, while Jean-Pierre Protzen and John Hemming argue that the nearby plain of Mascabamba better matches the descriptions of the encounter. In any case, the Inca army managed to hold the Spanish forces from a set of high terraces and flood their position to hinder their cavalry. Severely pressed and unable to advance, the Spaniards withdrew by night to Cusco. Despite this victory, the arrival of Spanish reinforcements to Cusco forced Manco Inca to abandon Ollantaytambo and seek refuge in the heavily forested region of Vilcabamba, where he established the small independent Neo-Inca State which survived until 1572.|$|E

25|$|Collecting {{for most}} people is a choice, but for <b>some</b> <b>it</b> can be a compulsion, sharing {{characteristics}} with obsessive hoarding. When collecting is passed between generations, it might sometimes be that children have inherited symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Collecting can sometimes reflect a fear of scarcity, or of discarding something then later regretting it. Certain patterns of collection are common among people who have lived through poverty or war.|$|E
25|$|Some {{analysts and}} journalists {{have criticized the}} Chilean Pension system, {{pointing}} out, for example, {{that it did not}} require the self-employed to contribute or arguing that it imposed excessive administrative costs. From a different angle, a paper published by the Institute of Economic Affairs showed that the Chilean model had indeed some shortcomings. But surprisingly to <b>some,</b> <b>it</b> argued that these were a result of overregulation.|$|E

25|$|In Nature, sucrose {{is present}} in many plants, and in {{particular}} their roots, fruits and nectars, because {{it serves as a}} way to store energy, primarily from photosynthesis. Many mammals, birds, insects and bacteria accumulate and feed on the sucrose in plants and for <b>some</b> <b>it</b> is their main food source. Seen from a human consumption perspective, honeybees are especially important because they accumulate sucrose and produce honey, an important foodstuff all over the world. The carbohydrates in honey itself primarily consists of fructose and glucose with trace amounts of sucrose only.|$|E
25|$|This {{investigation}} objectively {{documents the}} functional {{status of the}} sphincters. However, the clinical significance of the findings are disputed by <b>some.</b> <b>It</b> {{may be used to}} assess for pelvic floor dyssenergia, (anismus is a contraindication for certain surgeries, e.g. STARR), and these patients may benefit from post-operative biofeedback therapy. Decreased squeeze and resting pressures are usually the findings, and this may predate the development of the prolapse. Resting tone is usually preserved in patients with mucosal prolapse. In patients with reduced resting pressure, levatorplasty may be combined with prolapse repair to further improve continence.|$|E
25|$|According to some studies, {{the more}} often {{cannabis}} is used {{the more likely}} a person {{is to develop a}} psychotic illness, with frequent use being correlated with twice the risk of psychosis and schizophrenia. While cannabis use is accepted as a contributory cause of schizophrenia by <b>some,</b> <b>it</b> remains controversial, with pre-existing vulnerability to psychosis emerging as the key factor that influences the link between cannabis use and psychosis. Some studies indicate that the effects of two active compounds in cannabis, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), have opposite effects with respect to psychosis. While THC can induce psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals, CBD may reduce the symptoms caused by cannabis.|$|E

25|$|However, {{some species}} of Drosophila are {{difficult}} to culture in the laboratory, often because they breed on a single specific host in the wild. For <b>some,</b> <b>it</b> {{can be done with}} particular recipes for rearing media, or by introducing chemicals such as sterols that are found in the natural host; for others, it is (so far) impossible. In some cases, the larvae can develop on normal Drosophila lab medium, but the female will not lay eggs; for these it is often simply a matter of putting in a small piece of the natural host to receive the eggs. The , located at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, maintains cultures of hundreds of species for researchers.|$|E
25|$|The Cross of Sacrifice is {{considered}} one of the great pieces of war-related art. Its enduring popularity, historian Allen Frantzen says, is because it is both simple and expressive, its abstraction reflecting the modernity people valued after the war. Fabian Ware argued that its greatness was because its symbolism is so purposefully vague: To <b>some,</b> <b>it</b> is a Christian cross; to others, the stone is irrelevant and the sword itself is the cross; and to others, the artwork symbolizes those who sacrificed their lives to the sword. The theme of sacrifice is commonly seen in the piece. Jeroen Geurst points out that Lutyens' War Stone unsettlingly brings to mind images of soldiers sacrificed on the altar of war, while Blomfield's cross speaks about self-sacrifice and the saving grace of Jesus Christ's sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|The women disembarked in Quebec City, Trois-Rivières, and Montreal. After their arrival, {{their time}} to find husbands varied greatly. For <b>some,</b> <b>it</b> was as short as a few months, while others took {{two or three years}} before finding an {{appropriate}} husband. For the process of choosing a husband, and the marriage, most couples would officially get engaged in church, with their priest and witnesses present. Then, some couples went in front of the notary, to sign a marriage contract. Marriages were celebrated by the priest, usually in the woman’s parish of residence. While the marriage banns customarily were to be published three times before a wedding could take place, the colony’s need for women to marry quickly led to few filles du roi having marriage banns announced. It is known that 737 of these filles du roi were married in New France.|$|E

25|$|Lewis led {{a strong}} {{campaign}} during the 1975 election with his oratory and passion bringing new supporters to the party. The NDP highlighted {{issues such as}} rent control and workplace safety. Each day, Lewis {{told the story of}} a different Ontarian in trouble, making a case that this was {{because of the lack of}} adequate legislation. Polls showed the NDP surging and the incumbent Ontario Progressive Conservative Party in freefall and in the course of the campaign Premier William Davis was forced to commit his party to bringing in rent control and other progressive reforms in order to retain power. When the ballots were counted the Tories were reduced to a minority government. Lewis' NDP had doubled its seats from 19 to 38, surpassing the Ontario Liberal Party to become the Official Opposition. To <b>some</b> <b>it</b> appeared that it was only a matter of time before the NDP would form the government.|$|E
25|$|On paper, the redrawn 17th {{appeared}} to so heavily favor Gekas that it appeared unwinnable for a Democrat, even one as conservative as Holden. To <b>some,</b> <b>it</b> was blatant gerrymandering to force Holden into retirement. Gekas retained 60% {{of his former}} territory, and George W. Bush had carried the newly drawn district with 57% {{of the vote in}} 2000. However, to the surprise of many observers, Holden did not retire, instead opting to run in a district that was 65% new to him (a small corner from the even more Republican 9th District was moved to the 17th). Gekas was forced into his first real campaign ever. Holden managed to gain endorsements from much of Gekas' old base, much to Gekas' surprise. Even Gekas' hometown paper, The Patriot-News, endorsed Holden, saying that the 17th was not the same district that elected Gekas in 1982. Gekas got another rude surprise when Holden visited African American neighborhoods such as Uptown and Allison Hill after finding out that Gekas had never set foot in these neighborhoods in his congressional career. He asked the residents of these neighborhoods not to vote for a congressman who didn't bother to visit them. In November 2002, in one of the biggest upsets in recent political history, Holden narrowly defeated Gekas.|$|E
