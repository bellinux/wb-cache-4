40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to {{demonstrate}} the design process using a one-piece pattern design to create an elegant draped dress with bias seams. Aesthetically, this project is a medley of various factors (bias <b>seams,</b> lack of <b>side</b> <b>seams,</b> and one-piece-pattern), brought together through two theories: the Grecian design principle and Madeleine Vionnet 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 7 s bias cut. This diamond cut dress design {{is the result of}} a pilot study to explore the possibilities to use a diamond shape line to replace <b>side</b> <b>seams</b> and the waistline. Due to the complicated seams, tucks and dart, three samples were tested to complete a modified pattern. This design is based on the classic Grecian design principle of draping without traditional <b>side</b> <b>seams.</b> <b>Side</b> <b>seams</b> are replaced by bias seams such as Vionnet 2 ̆ 7 s bias cut effect. Additionally, this design is an attempt to develop a better system of using draping and drafting successfully and efficiently...|$|R
