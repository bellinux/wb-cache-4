5|$|Allosaurus {{had nine}} {{vertebrae}} in the neck, 14 in the back, and {{five in the}} sacrum supporting the hips. The number of tail vertebrae is unknown and varied with individual size; James Madsen estimated about 50, while Gregory S. Paul considered that to be too many and suggested 45 or less. There were hollow spaces in the neck and anterior back vertebrae. Such spaces, which are also found in modern theropods (that is, the birds), are interpreted as having held air sacs used in respiration. The rib cage was broad, giving it a barrel chest, especially in comparison to less derived theropods like Ceratosaurus. Allosaurus had gastralia (belly ribs), {{but these are not}} common findings, and they may have ossified poorly. In one published case, the gastralia show evidence of injury during life. A furcula (wishbone) was also present, but has only been recognized since 1996; in some cases furculae were confused with gastralia. The ilium, the main hip bone, was massive, and the pubic bone had a prominent foot that may have been used for both muscle attachment and as a prop for resting the body on the ground. Madsen noted that in about half of the individuals from the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry, independent of size, the pubes had not fused to each other at their foot ends. He suggested that this was a <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic,</b> with females lacking fused bones to make egg-laying easier. This proposal has not attracted further attention, however.|$|E

25|$|The {{hypothesis}} of sexual dimorphism in heterodontosaurids has long centered on Abrictosaurus. Tusks are a sexually dimorphic trait in many modern mammals, including musk deer, walrus, Asian elephants and many pigs, with tusks being present primarily in males. The lack of tusks in UCL B54 led to suggestions {{that it was}} female; perhaps even a female of another species. The discovery of caniniforms in UCL A100 showed that A. consors also has this 'male' characteristic, suggesting that {{it is at least}} a valid species in its own right. However, UCL B54 may actually be a juvenile, based on its short face and unfused sacral (hip) vertebrae. Therefore, the lack of tusks could be a juvenile trait instead of a secondary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic,</b> weakening the case for sexual dimorphism.|$|E
50|$|In other {{varieties}} of multicellular life (e.g. the fungi division, Basidiomycota) <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> {{can be much}} more complex, and may involve many more than two sexes. For details on the <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> of fungi, see: Hypha and Plasmogamy.|$|R
50|$|Sexism in American Presidential Election {{refers to}} sexism which is discrimination, prejudice, or {{stereotyping}} based on <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> or perceived <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Sexism is inherently {{a product of}} culture, as culture instills a certain set of beliefs or expectations for what constitutes as appropriate behavior, appearance, or mannerisms for a sex. Individuals belonging to a sex are expected to perform roles specific to their gender {{and in that way}} culture outlines roles for each gender based on <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics.</b>|$|R
50|$|The term primary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> {{denotes the}} kind of gamete the gonad {{produces}}: the ovary produces egg cells in the female, and the testis produces sperm cells in the male. The term secondary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> denotes all other sexual distinctions that play indirect roles in uniting sperm and eggs. Secondary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> include everything from the specialized male and female features of the genital tract, to the brilliant plumage of male birds or facial hair of humans, to behavioral features such as courtship.|$|R
500|$|Another theory, {{the sexual}} {{selection}} hypothesis, proposes {{that the long}} necks evolved as a secondary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic,</b> giving males an advantage in [...] "necking" [...] contests (see below) to establish dominance and obtain access to sexually receptive females. In support of this theory, necks are longer and heavier for males than females of the same age, and the former do not employ other forms of combat. However, one objection is that it fails to explain why female giraffes also have long necks. It has also been proposed that the neck serves to give the animal greater vigilance.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} vibrissae, the walrus is sparsely covered with fur and appears bald. Its skin is highly {{wrinkled}} and thick, up to [...] {{around the neck}} and shoulders of males. The blubber layer beneath is up to [...] thick. Young walruses are deep brown and grow paler and more cinnamon-colored as they age. Old males, in particular, become nearly pink. Because skin blood vessels constrict in cold water, the walrus can appear almost white when swimming. As a secondary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic,</b> males also acquire significant nodules, called [...] "bosses", particularly around the neck and shoulders.|$|E
2500|$|BDSM {{parties are}} events on which BDSM {{practitioners}} and other similarly interested people meet {{in order to}} communicate, share experiences and knowledge, and to [...] "play" [...] in an erotic atmosphere. The parties show similarities with ones in the dark culture, being based on {{a more or less}} strictly enforced dress code; most often clothing made of latex, leather or vinyl/PVC, lycra and so on., emphasizing the body's shape and the primary and secondary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic.</b> The requirement for such dress codes differ. While some events have none, others have a policy {{in order to create a}} more coherent atmosphere and to prevent onlookers from taking part.|$|E

2500|$|Fur is dense hair. Primarily, [...] fur augments the {{insulation}} the skin provides {{but can also}} serve as a secondary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic</b> or as camouflage. On some animals, the skin is very hard and thick, and can be processed to create leather. Reptiles and fish have hard protective scales on their skin for protection, and birds have hard feathers, all made of tough β-keratins. Amphibian skin is not a strong barrier, especially regarding the passage of chemicals via skin and is often subject to osmosis and diffusive forces. For example, a frog sitting in an anesthetic solution would be sedated quickly, as the chemical diffuses through its skin. [...] Amphibian skin plays key roles in everyday survival and their ability to exploit a wide range of habitats and ecological conditions.|$|E
60|$|Now {{so far as}} {{that goes}} it follows almost {{necessarily}} from my views upon aristocracy and democracy that I declare for the conventional equality of women, {{that is to say}} for the determination to make neither sex nor any <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic</b> a standard of superiority or inferiority, for the view that a woman is a person as important and necessary, as much to be consulted, and entitled to as much freedom of action as a man. I admit that this decision is a choice into which temperament enters, that I cannot produce compelling reasons why anyone else should adopt my view. I can produce considerations in support of my view, that is all. But they are so implicit in all that has gone before that I will not trouble to detail them here.|$|E

50|$|Although vellus hair {{is already}} {{present in the}} area in childhood, chest hair is the {{terminal}} hair that develops as an effect of rising levels of androgens (primarily testosterone and its derivatives) due to puberty.

50|$|Pickerel frogs display sexual dimorphism; {{the females}} are {{typically}} larger and darker in color than the males.

In general, secondary <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic</b> are not typically evident outside of the breeding season; therefore, pickerel frogs can be rather difficult to sex.|$|E

40|$|ERPs were {{recorded}} {{to investigate the}} processing of the appraisal of conscious and unconscious affective stimuli as being sexual using a backward masking paradigm. Twenty heterosexual participants between 18 and 35 years old had to discriminate whether bodies were naked or dressed in a supraliminal presentation (260 ms) and in a subliminal presentation (16 ms). The results showed that during the supraliminal presentation and the subliminal presentation, the amplitude of the N 190 component was significantly larger for the images of <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> versus dressed bodies over occipito-temporal electrodes. Through a segmentation procedure, a specific topographical microstate associated with the N 190 component was found, though it didn’t provide further information on the processing of <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The neural generators responsible for the processing of <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristics</b> were located at the occipito-temporal lobe {{as well as the}} amygdala.

50|$|Biologists {{characterize}} beards as {{a secondary}} <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic</b> {{because they are}} unique to one sex, yet do not play a direct role in reproduction. Charles Darwin first suggested possible evolutionary explanation of beards in his work The Descent of Man, which hypothesized {{that the process of}} sexual selection may have led to beards. Modern biologists have reaffirmed the role of sexual selection in the evolution of beards, concluding that there is evidence that a majority of females find men with beards more attractive than men without beards.|$|E
50|$|Breast development, {{also known}} as mammogenesis, is a complex {{biological}} process in primates that takes place throughout a female's life. It occurs across several phases, including prenatal development, puberty, and pregnancy. At menopause, breast development ceases and the breasts atrophy. Breast development results in prominent and developed structures on the chest known as breasts in primates, which serve as both a <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic</b> and as mammary glands. The process is mediated by an assortment of hormones (and growth factors), {{the most important of}} which include estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, and growth hormone.|$|E
50|$|Terminal hair {{growth on}} arms is a {{secondary}} <b>sexual</b> <b>characteristic</b> in boys and {{appears in the}} last stages of puberty. Vellus arm hair is usually concentrated on the elbow end of the forearm and often ends on {{the lower part of}} the upper arm. This type of intense arm vellus hair growth sometimes occurs in young women and people of both sexes until puberty. Even though this causes the arms to appear hairy, it is not caused solely by testosterone. The hair is softer and different from men's arm hair, in texture.|$|E
