40|$|This paper {{examines}} the European Commission's (EC) Better <b>Regulation</b> <b>Agenda,</b> {{from the time}} that President Barroso came to power, in November 2004, to the 2006 summer recess. It particularly focuses on whether the Commission's regulatory thinking has moved away from the precautionary principle and towards Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA), something I predicted in 2004 (Lofstedt 2004). The article summarizes the papers and communications in the Better Regulation area put forward by the Commission since November 2004, and makes a number of observations about how the Better <b>Regulation</b> <b>Agenda</b> may develop in the future. In conclusion I argue that the Commission's Better <b>Regulation</b> <b>Agenda</b> has plateaued. Commissioner Verheugen will not be successful in pushing the Agenda further forward because of issues such as REACH and opposition from member states, notably France. It is based on a combination of desk research and interviews with policy-makers, regulators, academics and stakeholders who have been involved either in shaping or fighting the Better <b>Regulation</b> <b>Agenda.</b> Regulatory Reform...|$|R

40|$|It {{concerns}} a master thesis on {{the implementation of}} the EU's Better <b>Regulation</b> <b>agenda,</b> an ambitious policy agenda, launched in 2002, to cut down bureaucracy and improve the quality of legislation. Since then, the Better <b>Regulation</b> <b>agenda</b> has been presented as a remedy to all kinds of challenges the EU is facing: boosting the European economy, restoring the EU's credibility, promoting sustainable development, producing more effective policies, etc. However, {{the implementation of the}} Better <b>Regulation</b> <b>agenda</b> cannot be accelerated in the same gear as can political ambitions and expectations. For the Better Regulation measures (like the introduction of an integrated impact assessment system) to crystallize and bring about real change, it will require adjustments in the administrative structures and procedures that influence the day to day working methods of policy-makers and decision-makers. To complicate matters even more, one should take into account that the EU is a multi-level governance system. That is to say that the EU's decision-making and policy-making process involves a lot of actors, operating at different levels: the Commission, the European Parliament, the Council, 27 Member States. Each player represents in itself a complex bureaucratic organisation as well. Thus, to alter the entire European decision-making process by means of Better Regulation policies, will not only require adjustments at all these levels, but also sufficient coordination and interaction between these levels. This thesis tries to explore to what extent the implementation of the Better <b>Regulation</b> <b>agenda</b> has been successful so far. What institutional adjustments have been carried through by the different actors, and has this had an effect on decision-making and policy-making? What about the interaction between the European level and the national level (using the Netherlands as a case study) ? What can be said about the prospects of the Better Regulation campaign...|$|R
40|$|Government endorses {{the idea}} of “smart regulation”, seeing it as an {{attractive}} wrapper for a business-friendly approach to regulation that could make savings to the public purse whilst offering improvements in consumer protection. The result is to bring the regulation of commercial providers {{of goods and services}} closer to previously privileged concepts of professional self-regulation on the basis that it offers “cost-free” regulation. This paper examines whether <b>smart</b> <b>regulation</b> is just another manifestation of a “fictional commodity” enabling producers to cloak their activities in a favourable light. Alternatively, <b>smart</b> <b>regulation</b> could result in greater transparency, giving legitimacy to the providers of goods and services and better protection for consumers. The drama of <b>smart</b> <b>regulation</b> in disarray in the financial sector since the 2008 “crunch” provides one perspective, but the authors argue that {{now is the time to}} formulate a theory of regulation and governance that better captures recent developments. Having published separately on disparate issues of regulation (including food law, statutory nuisance, professions, service charge management and financial accounting), the authors draw these together here. Our model is based on Gunningham’s (2009) concept of regulatory “architecture”. This has been developed into a “Triptych” of regulatory processes that better describes the relations between regulator and the regulated...|$|R
40|$|The European Commission {{recently}} announced {{its intention to}} mainstream the Sustainable Development Goals in its policy process, {{as part of its}} approach to implement the 2030 Agenda. This explicitly involves the EU's better <b>regulation</b> <b>agenda,</b> but the current tools and methods used in both ex ante impact assessment and ex post policy evaluation would need to be adapted to link better regulation with SDGs more effectively. More generally, this would also mean that the better <b>regulation</b> <b>agenda</b> becomes an instrument for policy coherence in EU public policy, and not only an instrument for efficiency. In this paper, the author reflects on the changes that would be needed in governance and better regulation methods, and in the European Semester and Cohesion policy.

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the challenge of}} regulation across national borders using {{the example of the}} shipping industry.

It concludes that effective global regulation faces considerable challenges. Within the relatively conducive environment of shipping it finds that <b>smart</b> <b>regulation</b> has been vitiated by perceived inconsistency in inspection practice and that enforced self-regulation has been rendered less effective by cross-national differences in resourcing and regulatory commitment, compounded by the difficulties of paper-based validation.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} current {{instrument}} mix, designs options for <b>smart</b> <b>regulation</b> and estimates the support base of new instruments {{for the forest}} expansion policy in Flanders (northern Belgium). The framework applied {{is a combination of}} theories on instrument choice (ICT), policy transfer and legitimacy. The ICT points out {{that there is a need}} for new environmental policy instruments (NEPI) oriented to private actors that inform them or create win¿win situations for all involved parties. The need is especially high for farmers, who are key actors. The policy transfer analysis suggested instruments currently in use in the Netherlands, England and Denmark that can fulfill these needs. However, the acceptability ¿ or legitimacy ¿ of the suggested instruments in Flanders is only high for three of these, notably the carbon fund, flexible grant scheme and expert advice (especially by forest groups). This largely fills some <b>smart</b> <b>regulation</b> gaps, like the need for information (expert advice), the involvement of other institutional actors (certifiers, forest groups) and the higher involvement of the private sector (all). However, some gaps, such as flexible land purchase through cooperation with real estate agents or other private agents and opportunities for win¿win outcomes with farmers, remain. Thus, it is not possible to fully optimize the instrument mix in accordance with the <b>smart</b> <b>regulation</b> requirements in Flanders¿ forest expansion policy at this moment. However, as continuity or incremental change is characteristic of most public policy, this does not mean that the suggested changes will be impossible in the near future, especially with the changing character of the rural spac...|$|R

40|$|The EU’s {{governance}} reform {{does not}} match the expectations of its promoters; the ‘new’ instruments seem to under-perform. One explanation, explored here, is that governance has been discussed without much attention for capacities at the operational level. Analyses are needed of how instruments are used and designed within the EU’s multilevel administrative system. To move from governance to capacities, three interrelated levels of learning are distinguished to examine whether changes in governance are supported by developments in organisational capacities: ‘governance learning’, ‘instrument learning’ and ‘organisational learning’. One hypothesis is that these need to develop simultaneously. The second hypothesis is that, in the EU's multilevel administration, learning along these dimensions has {{to take place in}} parallel at EU and national levels. This article analyses the capacities which the Commission and the Netherlands have created to support the better <b>regulation</b> <b>agenda.</b> It concludes a match between the three levels of learning in the Commission but a mismatch between learning in the Commission and the Netherlands. This multilevel mismatch may help to explain the lack of success of the EU’s better <b>regulation</b> <b>agenda...</b>|$|R
40|$|When {{regulators}} {{are faced with}} practical challenges, policy instrument choice theories can help them find the best solution. However, not all such theories are equally helpful. This paper aims to offer regulators a better alternative to the current policy instrument choice theories. We will specifically address the shortcomings of “smart regulation theory” and present an alternative that keeps the best of that theory while remediating its weak points. Some authors (Böcher and Töller 2003; Baldwin and Black 2008) say that <b>smart</b> <b>regulation</b> theory does not address institutional issues, compliance type-specific response, performance-sensitivity and adaptability of regulatory regime. We have resolved these problems by merging the <b>smart</b> <b>regulation</b> theory with the policy arrangement approach and the policy learning concept. We call the resulting approach “regulatory arrangement approach” (RAA). The central idea of the RAA is to constrain the almost infinite “smart” regulatory options by: the national policy style; adverse effects of policy arrangements of adjoining policies; {{the structure of the}} policy arrangement of the investigated policy and competence dependencies of other institutions. The reduction can be so drastic that the potential governance capacity falls below the <b>smart</b> <b>regulation</b> threshold. In other words, no smart regulatory arrangement can be developed in that institutional context unless policy learning occurs. In addition, a “smart” regulatory arrangement is no guarantee that the policy will succeed. For this reason, the performance of the regulatory arrangement is measured and evaluated. Performance below a certain threshold indicates that the regulatory arrangement needs to be adapted, which then results in policy learning. We illustrate the usefulness of this new approach with a secondary analysis of the Flemish sustainable forest management polic...|$|R

These objectives lead Europe towards a complete decarbonisation of the electricity system. There is a key role to be played by grids in facilitating the required transformation and this implies they need to become “smart”. In practical terms, making grids smart means deepening the energy system integration and grid users participation. Grids have to reconfigure notably for the integration of distributed generation (DG), the integration of massive large-scale renewable (RES), and for the integration of facilitating demand response. Smarter grids need a <b>smarter</b> <b>regulation.</b> A <b>smart</b> <b>regulation</b> reconfigures the incentives and coordination tools of grid companies and grid users and aligns them towards the new policy objectives.

40|$|The {{competitiveness}} of the European {{economy has been}} a central point of concern and, with the Better <b>Regulation</b> <b>agenda,</b> the European Commission has raised expectations, especially among SMEs. Better Regulation {{is seen as a}} dynamic process that is not just about drafting rules, but also includes the proper implementation and enforcement of the law by the Member States. In general, the justification for the Better <b>Regulation</b> <b>agenda</b> is the claim that regulatory frameworks in the EU are too unwieldy and complex. This is a major handicap on EU competitiveness, crippling European companies in relation not just to their US partners but also to emerging competitors. The question is whether these arguments hold in the field of company law. In the Member States’ national company law agendas the main worries are not related to the US or emerging competitors. After examining the various contributions to our inquiry the authors conclude that the basic element of recent national reforms of company law has been the effort to outbid direct neighbours. The deregulation policy that characterises current national and EU company law, as presented in the overview, appears to stimulate regime-shopping inside the European Union rather than to contribute to a more sustainable legal setting...|$|R

Second, avoid unexplained discrepancies between the regulation and the standard. Third, if an existing widely accepted standard does not, on its own, meet all the public policy goals of the proposed regulation, indicate clearly how the standard is deficient and what more is required to meet public policy objectives. Fourth, should consult relevant standards development committees when developing regulations. Fifth, take advantage of ongoing opportunities to participate in the work of relevant standards development committees, to keep abreast of developments and influence the content of standards.
