5|$|In 1955, the McCartney {{family moved}} {{for the last}} time to a small three-bedroomed brick-built terrace house at 20 Forthlin Road in Allerton, which is now owned by The National Trust. It only cost £1:6s:0d per week, which was due to Mary's {{seniority}} at the hospital. Before moving to Forthlin Road, Jim had been secretary of the Speke Horticultural Society, and had often sent his sons out to canvass for new members. Jim planted dahlias and snapdragons in the front garden of Forthlin Road and regularly trimmed the lavender hedge, although it was Paul's job to collect horse manure from the local streets in a bucket to be dug into the flowerbeds. As Jim was a heavy smoker, Jim would first dry and then crush <b>sprigs</b> <b>of</b> Lavender and then burn them (like incense) in the ashtrays to kill the smell of his cigarette smoke.|$|E

The source of the earthly haoma plant is a shining white tree that grows on a paradisiacal mountain. <b>Sprigs</b> <b>of</b> this white haoma were brought to earth by divine birds.|$|E

25|$|Many {{prominent}} Victorians {{were involved}} in La Trobe's establishment process, {{and there was a}} strong belief {{that it was important to}} increase research and learning in Victoria. One of the major individuals involved was Davis McCaughey, who later became Governor of Victoria. The university was named after Charles Joseph La Trobe, the first Governor of Victoria, and the university motto, 'whoever seeks shall find', is adapted from Charles La Trobe's family motto. The La Trobe University Coat of Arms incorporates the scallop shells from the La Trobe family bearings, the Australian wedge-tailed eagle to represent Australia, and <b>sprigs</b> <b>of</b> heath to represent Victoria.|$|E
25|$|Typical modern dawn {{services}} {{follow a}} pattern that is now familiar to generations of Australians, containing the following features: introduction, hymn, prayer, an address, laying of wreaths, recitation, the playing of the Last Post, a minute of silence, Reveille, and the playing of both the New Zealand and Australian national anthems. At the Australian War Memorial, following {{events such as the}} Anzac Day and Remembrance Day services, families often place artificial red poppies beside the names of relatives on the Memorial's Roll of Honour. In Australia, <b>sprigs</b> <b>of</b> rosemary are often worn on lapels and in New Zealand poppies have taken on this role.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{escutcheon}} (shield), {{there are}} three main features: the heath, the escallop shells and the book. The heath refers to the common heath (epacris impressa), which is the floral emblem of the State of Victoria, a highly relevant symbol being Victoria's third university. In a sense, it also reflects the university's attempts to cater to all Victorians, particularly regional Victorians, {{which at the time}} had felt excluded by the establishment of metropolitan-centred universities. The blue ribbon serves a decorative purpose in tying both <b>sprigs</b> <b>of</b> heath together to form a chaplet. The chaplet itself is a seemingly unintended reference to the State, as it traditionally represented victory (and hence, Victoria).|$|E

25|$|It {{should always}} be borne in mind that color was the keynote of this scheme. The custom was {{practically}} universal, and enough traces remain to show how splendid was {{the effect of these}} old Gothic churches and cathedrals. The priests in their gorgeous vestments, the lights, the crucifix, the banners and incense, the frescoed or diapered walls, and that crowning glory of Gothic art, the stained glass, were all in harmony with these beautiful schemes of colored carved work. Red, blue, green, white and gilding were the tints as a rule used. Not only were the screens painted in colors, but the parts painted white were often further decorated with delicate lines and <b>sprigs</b> <b>of</b> foliage in conventional pattern. The plain surfaces of the panels were also adorned with saints, often on a background of delicate gesso diaper, colored or gilded (Southwold). Nothing could exceed the beauty of the triptychs or retables of Germany, Flanders or France; carved with scenes from the New Testament in high relief arranged under a delicate lacework of canopies and clustered pinnacles glistening with gold and brilliant colors. In Germany the effect was further enhanced by emphasizing parts of the gilding by means of a transparent varnish tinted with red or green, thus giving a special tone to the metallic luster.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} {{paneling}} generally, there were, {{during the last}} fifty years of the period now under review, three styles of design followed by most European carvers, each of which attained great notoriety. Firstly, a developed form of small Panelling. tracery which was very common in France and the Netherlands. A square-headed panel would be filled in with small detail of flamboyant character, the perpendicular line or mullion being always subordinate, as in the German chasse (Muse Cluny), and in some cases absent, as the screen work of Évreux cathedral shows us. Secondly, the linenfold design. The great majority of examples are of a very conventional form, but at Bere Regis, Dorsetshire, the designs with tassels, and at St Sauvur, Caen, those with fringe work, readily justify the universal title applied to this very decorative treatment of large surfaces. At the beginning of the 16th century yet another pattern became the fashion. The main lines of the design consisted of flat hollow mouldings sometimes in the form of interlacing circles (Gatton, Surrey), at other times chiefly straight (Rochester cathedral), and the intervening spaces would be filled in with cusps or <b>sprigs</b> <b>of</b> foliage. It marks the last struggle of this great school of design to withstand the oncoming flood of the new art, the great Renaissance. From this time onward Gothic work, in spite of various attempts, has never again taken a place in domestic decoration. The lines of the tracery style, the pinnacle, and the crocket unequaled as they have always been in devotional expression are universally considered unsuited for decoration in the ordinary house.|$|E
500|$|The models {{initially}} {{submitted by}} Sinnock showed {{a bust of}} Roosevelt on the obverse and, on the reverse, a hand grasping a torch, and also clutching <b>sprigs</b> <b>of</b> olive and oak. Sinnock had prepared several other sketches for the reverse, including one flanking the torch with scrolls inscribed with the Four Freedoms. Other drafts showed representations of the goddess Liberty, and one commemorated the United Nations Conference of 1945, displaying the War Memorial Opera House where it took place. Numismatist David Lange described most of the alternative designs as [...] "weak". The models were sent on October 12 by Howard to Gilmore Clarke, chairman of the commission, who consulted with its members and responded on the 22nd, rejecting them, stating that [...] "the head of the late President Roosevelt, as portrayed by the models, is not good. It needs more dignity." [...] Sinnock had submitted an alternative reverse design similar to the eventual coin, with the hand omitted and the sprigs placed {{on either side of}} the torch; Clarke preferred this.|$|E

2500|$|The {{plant has}} also {{been used as a}} symbol for remembrance during war commemorations and {{funerals}} in Europe and Australia. Mourners would throw it into graves as a symbol of remembrance for the dead. In Shakespeare's Hamlet, Ophelia says, [...] "There's rosemary, that's for remembrance." [...] (Hamlet, iv. 5.) In Australia, <b>sprigs</b> <b>of</b> rosemary are worn on ANZAC Day and sometimes Remembrance Day to signify remembrance; the herb grows wild on the Gallipoli Peninsula.|$|E
