6000|$|Miss Assher, meanwhile, had seated {{herself by}} Caterina, and, with that smiling affability {{which seems to}} say, 'I am really not at all proud, though you might expect it of me,' said,--'Anthony tells me you sing <b>so</b> very <b>beautifully.</b> I hope we shall hear you this evening.' ...|$|R

500|$|The {{film was}} shot {{digitally}} using the Panavision Genesis camera. Gordon encouraged the actors to improvise, though Aniston claimed {{to not have}} taken advantage of the offer as much as her co-stars, stating, [...] "My dialogue was just <b>so</b> <b>beautifully</b> choreographed that there wasn’t much that I needed to do”.|$|E
500|$|In 1982 the {{orchestra}} celebrated its golden jubilee. At the anniversary concert Solti conducted the programme with which Beecham had inaugurated the LPO. Pirouet comments {{that with the}} exception of Delius's Brigg Fair, the music was as ideally suited to Solti's musical persona as to Beecham's. In The Guardian, Edward Greenfield wrote, [...] "I doubt if the LPO has ever played <b>so</b> <b>beautifully,</b> even in the days of Beecham".|$|E
500|$|Manne {{was also}} {{acclaimed}} by singers. Jackie Cain, of the vocal team of Jackie and Roy ("Roy" [...] being Roy Kral), claimed {{that she had}} [...] "never heard a drummer play <b>so</b> <b>beautifully</b> behind a singer". Jackie and Roy were {{only two of the}} many singers he played behind, recording several albums with that husband-and-wife team, with their contemporary June Christy, and with Helen Humes, originally made famous by her singing with the Count Basie orchestra.|$|E

Significantly increased statistics and higher energy reach may provide the sensitivity to shake its foundations, while other experiments and facilities may be need to complete the physics interpretation...|$|R
500|$|In {{addition}} {{to issues of}} Civil Rights, Fonda has been an opponent of oil developments and their adverse effects on the environment. In 2017, while on a trip with Greenpeace to protest oil developments, Fonda criticized Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying at the summit on climate change in Paris, known as the Paris agreement, Trudeau [...] "talked <b>so</b> <b>beautifully</b> of needing {{to meet the requirements}} of the climate treaty and to respect and hold to the treaties with indigenous people...and yet he has betrayed every {{one of the things he}} committed to in Paris." ...|$|E
500|$|Lynch {{described}} {{the attractiveness of}} the idea of a pilot, despite the knowledge that the medium of television would be constricting: [...] "I'm a sucker for a continuing story... Theoretically, you can get a very deep story and you can go so deep and open the world <b>so</b> <b>beautifully,</b> but it takes time to do that." [...] The story included normal and surreal elements, much like Lynch's earlier series Twin Peaks. Groundwork was laid for story arcs, such as the mystery of Rita's identity, Betty's career and Adam Kesher's film project.|$|E
500|$|In {{a letter}} to Alfred Russel Wallace dated 23 February 1867 Charles Darwin wrote [...] "On Monday evening I called on Bates & put a {{difficulty}} before him, which he could not answer, & as on some former similar occasion, his first suggestion was, 'you had better ask Wallace'. My difficulty is, why are caterpillars sometimes <b>so</b> <b>beautifully</b> & artistically coloured?" [...] Darwin was puzzled because his theory of sexual selection (where females choose their mates based on how attractive they are) could not apply to caterpillars since they are immature and hence not sexually active.|$|E

500|$|Apart from {{enlarged}} {{and sometimes}} slightly elaborated initials opening the Ammonian Sections (the contemporary {{equivalent of the}} modern division into verses), and others in red {{at the start of}} chapters, the text has no illumination or decoration, but Sir David Wilson, historian of Anglo-Saxon art and Director of the British Museum, used it as his example in writing [...] "some manuscripts are <b>so</b> <b>beautifully</b> written that illumination would seem only to spoil them". [...] Julian Brown wrote that [...] "the capitular uncial of the Stonyhurst Gospel owes its beauty to simple design and perfect execution. [...] The decorative elements in the script never interfere with the basic structure of the letter-forms; they arise naturally from the slanted angle at which the pen was held".|$|E
500|$|In December 1994, Madonna sent Parker a four-page letter {{explaining}} {{that she was}} the best person to portray Eva and would be fully committed to the role; She also sent him a copy of her [...] "Take a Bow" [...] music video as a way of [...] "auditioning". Rice believed that Madonna suited the title role since she could [...] "act <b>so</b> <b>beautifully</b> through music". Lloyd Webber was wary about her singing. Since the film required the actors to sing their own parts, Madonna underwent vocal training with coach Joan Lader to increase her own confidence in singing the unusual songs, and project her voice in a much more cohesive manner. Lader noted that the singer [...] "had to use her voice in a way she's never used it before. Evita is real musical theater— it's operatic, in a sense. Madonna developed an upper register that she didn't know she had." ...|$|E
500|$|In the novella, Bowden's {{high school}} {{counselor}} Edward French confronts {{the student with}} suspicions that Dussander is not really Bowden's grandfather, and Bowden murders French in cold blood. Bowden then embarks on a shooting spree from a tree overlooking a freeway, which results in his death five hours later. Singer felt unable to accomplish King's ending: [...] "I told [...] the ending reads <b>so</b> <b>beautifully.</b> I could never measure up to it; I would have killed it." [...] In the film, Bowden intimidates French, who suspects Dussander's false relationship to the student, by threatening to destroy him with [...] "rumor and innuendo". Stanley Wiater, author of The Complete Stephen King Universe, wrote, [...] "As depicted on screen, Todd is much more consciously evil, in his way, than in the book. This switch, while making the ending less brutal, perhaps, achieves the impossible: it also makes the ending even darker." ...|$|E
5000|$|Mary Pickford praised Talmadge's {{performance}} and the film's sets, costumes, and entertaining story. [...] "It deals with a subject which interests most women—that of spiritualism—which is <b>so</b> delicately and <b>beautifully</b> handled that it could offend no one," [...] she described. It {{was one of her}} favorite films.|$|R

500|$|In 1973 the Walker Art Center curated a major {{exhibition}} of her work, which traveled for two years. In 1975 she designed the chapel of St. Peter's Lutheran Church in midtown Manhattan. When {{asked about her}} role as a Jewish artist creating Christian-themed art, Nevelson stated that her abstract work transcended religious barriers. Also in 1975, she created and installed a large wood sculpture titled Bicentennial Dawn at the new James A. Byrne United States Courthouse in Philadelphia. During the last half of her life, Nevelson solidified her fame and her persona, cultivating a personal style for her [...] "petite yet flamboyant" [...] self that contributed to her legacy: dramatic dresses, scarves and large false eyelashes. When Alice Neel asked Nevelson how she dressed <b>so</b> <b>beautifully,</b> Nevelson replied [...] "Fucking, dear, fucking", in reference to her sexually liberated lifestyle. The designer Arnold Scaasi created many of her clothes. Nevelson died on April 17, 1988.|$|E
500|$|The Times {{described}} the ceremony as [...] "a masterpiece", with The Daily Telegraph {{saying it was}} [...] "brilliant, breathtaking, bonkers and utterly British". The BBC's chief sports writer Tom Fordyce called it [...] "eccentric" [...] and [...] "tongue-in-cheek", saying [...] "no-one expected ... {{it would be quite}} so gloriously daft, so cynicism-squashingly charming and, well, so much pinch-yourself fun." [...] Two weeks after the ceremony Jonathan Freedland of The Guardian wrote that [...] "Boyle's spectacular, <b>so</b> <b>beautifully</b> executed and ingeniously conceived it lingers in the mind even as the closing draws near, stood apart from its predecessors thanks not only to its humour and eccentricity, but also because it had something to say." [...] Writing in The Observer, Jackie Kay commented that [...] "it seemed that Boyle had invented a new kind of opening ceremony, a concept ceremony, one that embraces big ideas as passionately as it does technical flamboyancy". The Stage said that [...] "Danny Boyle's spectacular and moving Olympics Opening Ceremony was undoubtedly the theatrical highlight of 2012".|$|E
500|$|After college, Meyer {{moved to}} Denver, Colorado, {{planning}} to [...] "scientifically" [...] win a fortune through dog racing. However, {{he ran out}} of money after two weeks. He then worked in a variety of jobs including as a substitute teacher, and a salesman in a clothing store, and also won $2,000 on the game show Jeopardy!. He at one point worked in a research lab as an assistant, studying glycoproteins [...] "in the hope that they would prove the key to cell-cell recognition." [...] Meanwhile, fellow Lampoon writers Tom Gammill and Max Pross suggested Meyer to comedian David Letterman who, along with head writer Merrill Markoe, hired him {{as a member of the}} writing staff on Letterman's new late night show. Letterman noted: [...] "Everything in his submission, down to the last little detail, was <b>so</b> <b>beautifully</b> honed." [...] Meyer wrote several recurring gags for the show, including [...] "Crushing Things With A Steamroller". His ambitions for the show were grandiose; [...] "I wanted to challenge the audience every night, stagger them with brilliance, blast them into a higher plane of existence," [...] he later explained.|$|E

60|$|The blue cat {{was asleep}} on a window seat, but it woke up when Trot tenderly {{took it in}} her lap and fed it milk from a blue-gold dish. It was a pretty cat and {{instantly}} knew the little girl was a friend vastly different from its own bad-tempered mistress, <b>so</b> it sang <b>beautifully</b> as a bird sings, and both the cat and the dog followed Trot into the third boudoir.|$|R
5000|$|Aesop's fable of [...] "The Swan and the Goose" [...] {{incorporates}} the swan song legend as saving its life {{when it was}} caught by mistake instead of the goose but was recognized by its song. [...] There is a subsequent reference in Aeschylus' Agamemnon (verses 1444-5) from 458 BC. In that play, Clytemnestra compares the dead Cassandra to a swan who has [...] "sung her last final lament". Plato's Phaedo (84d) records Socrates saying that, although swans sing in early life, they do not do <b>so</b> as <b>beautifully</b> as before they die. Furthermore, Aristotle noted in his History of Animals (615b) that swans [...] "are musical, and sing chiefly at the approach of death". By the third century BC the belief had become a proverb.|$|R
500|$|Jake Muncy of Wired, though {{impressed}} with the game, noted {{that the lack of}} any narrative or gameplay guidance could cause [...] "players to bounce off [...] entirely". Further, on completing the game, Muncy believed that though Blow had compared his game to the novel Gravity's Rainbow, it failed to create a vivid living setting in the island in contrast to the novel as to make it an engaging work. Oli Welsh of Eurogamer praised the game's puzzles for providing numerous [...] "eureka" [...] moments to the player and considered the title as the video game analog of the Goldberg Variations, but felt that the narrative atop the puzzles was [...] "self-involved and wilfully obscure", and believed {{that it could have been}} omitted, as Blow and his team [...] "needn't have tried to make a puzzle out of art when he had already, <b>so</b> <b>beautifully</b> and so successfully, made art out of puzzles". Justin McElroy of Polygon gave the game an 8/10 rating, describing it as [...] "uplifting but frustrating"; he criticized the length of time involved in solving certain puzzles while expressing concern that less-patient players would take shortcuts. [...] "That will naturally lead to more cheating. It will snowball." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{executive}} producer, Price {{was responsible}} for [...] "shaping the album's sound", deciding its track listing, and mixing the songs {{in order to ensure}} that they [...] "feel like they're part of the same album". Popjustice commented that every song on the album has [...] "gone through a bit of a Stuart Price filter so that it doesn't sound like some dickhead [...] A has just aimlessly scooped a load of tracks off a shelf". Aphrodite marked the first time Minogue enlisted an executive producer; discussing the process, she said [...] "It was just the best experience, and funnily enough I think it's the most cohesive album I've had since the beginning of my career, back in the PWL days, where by its very nature made it cohesive. There's a lot to be said for working with different producers and trying different stuff which has worked really well for me in the past but I definitely wanted someone to tie this together as Stuart has done <b>so</b> <b>beautifully</b> [...] so that it existed as a real body of work". Minogue and Price subjected songs on Aphrodite to a [...] "Parton Test", as they [...] "knew a song would work if it made sense when sung in the style of Dolly Parton". Shears also contributed to the album, while two of Pallot's collaborations with Minogue were kept. Additional collaborators on the album include Scottish disc jockey Calvin Harris, Swedish disc jockey Sebastian Ingrosso and Belgian musician Pascal Gabriel.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} for The Independent, Neela Debnath said that [...] "critics of the {{constant}} tampering with time will not like this episode" [...] but [...] "it is a cracker {{in terms of time}} paradoxes and the hypothetical moral dilemmas caused by said paradoxes". She praised the character development of Rory and the dynamic between the trio that had not been seen with previous characters in the show, as well as [...] "some great moments of comedy". She also called it a [...] "sumptuous visual delight" [...] in the sets of the garden and the centre. IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode 8.5 out of 10, praising MacRae for straying away from a complicated time travel narrative and instead give [...] "a simple yet refreshingly new examination of Amy Pond". He also praised Karen Gillan's climactic performance and director Nick Hurran. However, he criticised the [...] "iffy time travel rules" [...] and [...] "talkiness" [...] that ensured a slower pace. SFX magazine reviewer Nick Setchfield awarded [...] "The Girl Who Waited" [...] five out of five stars, praising Hurran as well as the performance of the three leads. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times praised MacRae's dialogue because [...] "it works <b>so</b> <b>beautifully</b> and is delivered to perfection by Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill". He also commented on Gillan's make-up job for the older Amy, which [...] "is brilliant in its subtlety" [...] but wished her hair could have been [...] "chopped or grey".|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} well {{received}} by most critics; some even hailed {{it as one}} of the most original American films of all time. Pauline Kael was among the most enthusiastic critics, calling it [...] "a true original, and a triumph of personal filmmaking" [...] and [...] "dizzyingly sensual". Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader said that [...] "the acting and editing have such original, tumultuous force that the picture is completely gripping". Vincent Canby of The New York Times reflected that [...] "no matter how bleak the milieu, no matter how heartbreaking the narrative, some films are <b>so</b> thoroughly, <b>beautifully</b> realized they have a kind of tonic effect that has no relation to the subject matter". Time Out magazine called it [...] "one of the best American films of the decade".|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{chain of}} thought {{began at the}} door steps we have passed, all whitened <b>beautifully</b> <b>so</b> as to display every footprint, and all {{representing}} an expenditure of useless, injurious labor in hearthstoning, that ought to madden an intelligent housemaid. I dont think our Armande is particularly intelligent; but I am resolved to spare her knees and her temper in future by banishing hearthstone from our establishment forever. I shudder to think that I have been walking upon those white steps and flag ways of ours every day without awakening {{to a sense of}} their immorality." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Jay Pritzker Pavilion {{received}} the first permanent outdoor LARES {{system in the}} US in 2004. The very visible system is held above the audience of 11,000 on a slender network of curved steel tubes called a [...] "trellis" [...] by architect Frank Gehry. LARES loudspeakers are positioned adjacent to the normal distributed sound system loudspeakers, to bring appropriately delayed reinforcement sound as well as synthesized ambience to each listener. Steve Robinson of classical radio station WFMT said [...] "I have {{never in my life}} heard sound projected <b>so</b> faithfully and <b>beautifully</b> over such a great distance... It was an ethereal experience." ...|$|R
