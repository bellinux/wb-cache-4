50|$|Single event upsets {{were first}} {{described}} during above ground nuclear testing, from 1954 to 1957, when many anomalies {{were observed in}} electronic monitoring equipment. Further problems were observed in space electronics during the 1960s, although {{it was difficult to}} separate soft-failures from other forms of interference. In 1972, a Hughes satellite experienced an upset where the communication with the satellite was lost for 96 seconds and then recaptured. Scientists Dr. Edward C.

In 1978, the first evidence of soft errors from alpha particles in packaging materials was described by Timothy C. May and M.H. Woods. In 1979, James Ziegler of IBM, along with W.
