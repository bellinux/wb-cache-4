50|$|<b>Slickline</b> {{refers to}} a single strand wire {{which is used to}} run tools into {{wellbore}} for several purposes. It is used in the oil and gas industry, but also describes that niche of the industry that involves using a <b>slickline</b> truck or doing a <b>slickline</b> job.|$|E
50|$|<b>Slickline</b> is more {{commonly}} used in production tubing. The wireline operator monitors at surface the <b>slickline</b> tension via a weight indicator gauge and the depth via a depth counter 'zeroed' from surface, lowers the downhole tool to the proper depth, completes the job by manipulating the downhole tool mechanically, checks {{to make sure it}} worked if possible, and pulls the tool back out by winding the <b>slickline</b> back onto the drum it was spooled from. The <b>slickline</b> drum is controlled by a hydraulic pump, which in turn is controlled by the 'slickline operator'.|$|E
50|$|When the <b>slickline</b> parts, {{this can}} create an {{expensive}} 'fishing' job. It is called fishing because you {{often have to}} try different 'fishing' tools until you get a 'bite', {{then you have to}} work the original tools downhole free, or cut off the <b>slickline</b> where they join the tools downhole so that you can pull the broken <b>slickline</b> back to surface and out of the way, in order to fish the stuck toolstring. Because of the downtime involved in 'fishing', meaning not being able to flow the oil/gas well, the client is losing money by lack of production and also the cost of the <b>slickline</b> unit to fish, and the cost of what is left in the hole if it is not fished out (in the oil/gas industry, if the cause of the fishing job was not the fault of the <b>slickline</b> company, the oil/gas company is usually responsible to pay for it, and it can be very expensive).|$|E
50|$|Used {{to place}} and recover {{wellbore}} equipment, such as plugs, gauges and valves, <b>slicklines</b> are single-strand non-electric cables lowered into {{oil and gas}} wells from the surface. <b>Slicklines</b> {{can also be used}} to adjust valves and sleeves located downhole, as well as repair tubing within the wellbore.|$|R
50|$|The {{disadvantage}} of a smaller diameter <b>slickline</b> is the lower strength. Depth {{and the nature}} of the job (a tool that must be pulled hard or might be stuck) will affect what <b>slickline</b> truck (different trucks specialize in different sizes of line) used.|$|E
5000|$|It {{keeps the}} reel drum size {{to a minimum}} (which reduces the area needed {{in the back of}} the <b>slickline</b> unit to house the drum and {{hydraulic}} pump, reducing weight and leaving more room for the other specialized equipment needed for <b>slickline</b> operations).|$|E
50|$|Commonly, {{perforation}} {{guns are}} run on E-line {{as it is}} traditional to use electrical signals from the surface to fire the guns. In more highly deviated wells, coiled tubing may be used. Newer technologies allow the guns to be run on <b>slickline.</b> Modern <b>slickline</b> technology embeds fiber optic lines that can transmit two-way data on real-time temperature, pressure and seismic responses {{along the length of}} the <b>slickline.</b> This information allows very precise operations of various down-hole tools, including perforation guns.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Slickline</b> Firing Head SystemSource: SchlumbergerIn {{workover}} operations, a well-servicing unit {{is used to}} winch {{items in}} and out of the wellbore. The line used to raise and lower equipment can be braided steel wireline or a single steel <b>slickline.</b> Workover operations conducted can include well clean-up, setting plugs, production logging and perforation through explosives.|$|E
50|$|Some {{completion}} components may {{be deployed}} and retrieved on <b>slickline</b> such as wireline retrievable safety valves, battery powered downhole gauges, perforating, placing explosively set bridge plugs, and placing or retrieving gas lift valves. <b>Slickline</b> {{can also be}} used for fishing, {{the process of trying to}} retrieve other equipment and wire, which has been dropped down the hole.|$|E
50|$|Seaboard Wireline {{provides}} {{electric and}} <b>slickline</b> services, pipe recovery, perforating, gamma ray and neutron source material logging operations.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Slickline</b> was {{originally}} called measuring line, because {{the line was}} flat like a tape measure, and marked with depth increments so the operators would know how deep in the hole they were. This probably changed because the flat measuring line wasn't {{as strong as the}} modern <b>slickline,</b> and separate depth counters were developed.It is advantageous to keep the diameter of the wire as small as possible for the following reasons: ...|$|E
5000|$|Oil and gas productionâ€”permanent {{downhole}} monitoring, coil tubing optical enabled deployed intervention systems, <b>slickline</b> {{optical cable}} deployed intervention systems.|$|E
50|$|Braided line is {{more complex}} than <b>slickline</b> due to the need for a grease {{injection}} system in the rigup to ensure the BOP can seal around the braided contours of the wire. It also requires an additional shear-seal BOP as a tertiary barrier as the upper master valve on the Christmas tree can only cut <b>slickline.</b> Braided line includes both the core-less variety used for heaving fishing and electric-line used for logging and perforating.|$|E
50|$|<b>Slickline</b> {{operations}} may be {{used for}} fishing, gauge cutting, setting or removing plugs, deploying or removing wireline retrievable valves, and memory logging.|$|E
50|$|<b>Slickline</b> {{looks like}} a long, smooth, unbraided wire, often shiny, silver/chrome in appearance. It comes in varying lengths, {{according}} to the depth of wells in the area it is used (it can be ordered to specification) up to 35,000 feet in length. It is used to lower and raise downhole tools used in oil and gas well maintenance to the appropriate depth of the drilled well. In use and appearance it is connected by the drum it is spooled off of {{in the back of}} the <b>slickline</b> truck to the wireline sheave a round wheel grooved and sized to accept a specified line and positioned to redirect the line to another sheave that will allow the <b>slickline</b> to enter the wellbore. <b>Slickline</b> is used to lower downhole tools into an oil or gas well to perform a specified maintenance job downhole. Downhole refers to the area in the pipe below surface, the pipe being either the casing cemented in the hole by the drilling rig (which keeps the drilled hole from caving in and pressure from the various oil or gas zones downhole from feeding into one another) or the tubing, a smaller diameter pipe hung inside the casing.|$|E
5000|$|The Geoservices Group {{has many}} {{separate}} companies that provide various services in drilling, formation evaluation, <b>slickline</b> conveyance, measurements and diagnostics, remediation of wells. These are: ...|$|E
50|$|Wrapped {{around a}} drum {{on the back}} of a truck, the <b>slickline</b> is raised and lowered in the well by reeling in and out the wire hydraulically.|$|E
50|$|A {{separation}} tool is pinned in {{the open}} position when run by <b>slickline.</b> This provides a flow path {{through the center of the}} tool while it is being set in the sliding sleeve.|$|E
50|$|The company mainly {{engages in}} {{wellhead}} and <b>slickline</b> services {{with oil and}} gas companies, such as EnCana. The company also has operations in hot oil, pressure testing, downhole rental tools & Luft Machine manufacturing arm.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical jars {{look like}} a long, tubular piece of {{machined}} metal that slides longer or shorter approximately 75% to 90% of its total length. They give the effect of hammering on the downhole tools. The weight or hit of the 'hammer' {{depends on how much}} sinker bar is added above the jars. Generally, a <b>slickline</b> operator controls the downhole tools with taps and hits from the sinker bar via the mechanical jars, controlled at surface by lowering or raising the toolstring and monitoring weight, depth, and pressure. Mechanical jars for <b>slickline</b> can hit up or down the hole, making them a versatile form of jarring.|$|E
50|$|<b>Slickline</b> tools {{operate with}} a {{mechanical}} action, controlled from {{surface in the}} wireline trucks operators compartment. Typically, this mechanical action is accomplished by the operation of jars. There are generally two types of jars; mechanical and hydraulic.|$|E
50|$|Braided line is {{generally}} used when {{the strength of}} <b>slickline</b> is insufficient for the task. Most commonly, this is for heavy fishing such as retrieving broken drill pipe. The most common use for braided line is fishing electric line tools.|$|E
50|$|The {{sliding sleeve}} can be {{shifted to the}} open {{position}} and the separation tool can be run and locked into the bore of the sliding sleeve by standard <b>slickline</b> methods. The separation tool allows flow to enter from the annulus and produce up the tubing. The tool blanks off the tubing below the sleeve to isolate the lower zone.|$|E
5000|$|In cased hole {{operation}} {{there is}} normally a [...] "Slick Line" [...] intervention unit. This uses a solid mechanical wire (0.072 - 0.125 inches in OD), to manipulate or otherwise carry out {{operations in the}} well bore completion system. Memory operations are often carried out on this <b>Slickline</b> conveyance in preference to mobilizing a full service Electric Wireline unit.|$|E
50|$|By itself, this {{information}} allows operators {{to prove that}} their well does not cross into areas {{that they are not}} authorized to drill. However, due to the cost of MWD systems, they are not generally used on wells intended to be vertical. Instead, the wells are surveyed after drilling through the use of multi-shot surveying tools lowered into the drillstring on <b>slickline</b> or wireline.|$|E
50|$|Bonnett's Energy Services Trust {{is focused}} on {{providing}} oilfield services through four operating divisions: Wireline Services, including <b>slickline,</b> electric line, and swabbing services; Testing Services, including production testing, frac recovery, Under balanced drilling recovery, well bleed offs, pipeline bleed offs and related services; Well stimulation, including fracturing, acidizing and nitrogen services; and Fishing and Rentals, including rental of fishing and oilfield equipment, and services to be used on drilling and service rigs.|$|E
50|$|Tools {{inserted}} into the well for both workover and logging efforts, wirelines and slicklines are very similar devices. While a <b>slickline</b> is a thin cable introduced into a well to deliver and retrieve tools downhole, a wireline is an electrical cable used to lower tools into and transmit data about {{the conditions of the}} wellbore called wireline logs. Usually consisting of braided cables, wirelines are used to perform wireline logging, as well.|$|E
50|$|The newest {{addition}} to the Helix Well Ops fleet, the Well Enhancer is designed to minimize production downtime and provide a cost-effective method of maintaining subsea production systems. With 1,100 m2 of main deck space and offloading capability, the new vessel can also perform a range of well testing procedures. Well Enhancer features a 150-ton multipurpose tower capable of deploying wireline, <b>slickline</b> and coiled tubing tools. The vessel also features kill pumps, an intervention lubricator control system and an active heave-compensated main winch.|$|E
5000|$|The type {{of sensors}} {{are limited in}} {{comparison}} to those used on Electric Line, and tend to be focussed on the cased hole,production stage of the well. Although there are now developed some memory [...] "Open Hole" [...] compact formation evaluation tool combinations. These tools can be deployed and carried downhole concealed internally in drill pipe {{to protect them from}} damage while running in the hole, and then [...] "Pumped" [...] out the end at depth to initiate logging. Other basic open hole formation evaluation memory tools are available for use in [...] "Commodity" [...] markets on <b>slickline</b> to reduce costs and operating time.|$|E
50|$|The {{separation}} {{tool assembly}} is run on an appropriate running tool {{complete with a}} running prong. The running prong {{is connected to the}} top of the internal seal prong with a shear pin, and the running tool is attached to the lock in the normal manner. After locating the sliding sleeve, the operator jars downward to set the lock, then pulls upward to close the isolation plug in the separation tool. As this happens, a garter spring in the isolation plug moves a steel shear pin into a groove on the sealing prong, and an O-ring on the internal prong seals to isolate the tubing below the sliding sleeve. The running prong that is pinned {{to the top of the}} internal prong is then sheared, and the <b>slickline</b> toolstring may be withdrawn from the well.|$|E
5000|$|A gauge cutter {{is a tool}} with a round, {{open-ended}} bottom {{which is}} milled to an accurate size. Large openings above {{the bottom of the}} tool allow for fluid bypass while running in the hole.Most often a gauge ring will be the first tool ran on a <b>slickline</b> operation. A gauge ring that is just undersized will allow the operator to ensure clear tubing down to the deepest projected working depth; for example 2 7/8" [...] tubing containing 2.313" [...] profiles would call for a gauge ring between 2.25" [...] - 2.30". A gauge ring {{can also be used to}} remove light paraffin that may have built up in the tubing. Often a variety of different sized gauges and/or scratchers will be run to remove parafin little by little.Gauge cutter can be used for drift runs also.|$|E
50|$|<b>Slickline</b> {{comes in}} {{different}} sizes and grades. The larger the size, and higher the grade, generally means the higher line tension can be pulled before the line snaps at the weakest spot and causes a costly 'fishing' job. Due to downhole tools getting stuck because of malfunctions or 'downhole conditions' including sand, scale, salt, asphaltenes, and other well byproducts settling or loosening off the pipe walls because of agitation {{either by the}} downhole tools or a change in downhole inflow, sometimes {{it is necessary to}} pull hard on the tools to bring them back uphole to surface. If the tools are stuck, and the operator pulls too hard, the line will snap or pull apart at the weakest spot, which is generally closer to surface as the further uphole the weak point in the line is, the more weight it has to support (the weight of the line).|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic jars for <b>slickline</b> are {{generally}} meant to jar up only, because not enough sinker bar {{is able to}} feasibly be lubricated in to jar down on the downhole tools. Hydraulic jars work by the operator pulling up on the line, which puts an upward force {{on the top of}} the hydraulic jars. The bottom of the hydraulic jars is usually attached by threaded connection to the mechanical jars, which are attached to the downhole tools. Depending on how hard the operator pulls on the hydraulic jars will affect how fast they hit, and how hard they hit. When the top is pulled on, the inner mandrel begins to slide upwards. It has a restriction in it that hydraulic fluid has to bypass as it is pulled upwards, until it reaches an area of no restriction, allowing it to slide rapidly. The reason for the initial tighter restriction is to allow the operator to pull his line to the desired hitting range.|$|E
50|$|In 2009 the Well Enhancer {{completed}} its first well intervention {{job in the}} North Sea for Nexen Petroleum 60 miles east of Aberdeen, Scotland in adverse weather conditions with wave heights in excess of five metres and 45 knot winds. In 2012, the Well Enhancer completed the first well intervention work ever done in West Africa from a mono-hull vessel instead of a rig or semi-submersible. The vessel is owned by Helix Energy Solutions Group and operated by the companyâ€™s well intervention business unit, Helix Well Ops. The mono-hull vessel was {{designed to provide a}} stable working platform to minimize downtime in the typically rough seas in the North Sea where she primarily operates. Based in Aberdeen, Well Enhancer has 1,100 m2 of main deck space and offloading capability, in addition to a 150-ton multipurpose tower capable of deploying wireline, <b>slickline</b> and coiled tubing tools. The vessel also features kill pumps, an intervention lubricator control system and an active heave-compensated main winch.|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} {{experiments on}} the use of lightweight concrete in the density range of 100 Ib/ft 3 for liners in underground mines. Three test sections were completed: a monolithic, portal-type structure with integral walls and arch constructed aboveground; an underground test section constructed in a mine drift using plywood forms; and a second section constructed in a drift using an air-supported formwork. The lightweight concrete in the two underground test sections was placed using piston pumps and a <b>slickline.</b> Fiber reinforcement was added to the concrete in the mine sections without any apparent problems with either pumping or placement of the concrete. In another experiment, the Bureau and Hecla Mining Co., Mullan, rD, used lightweight concrete in the density range of 25 Iblfe to replace timber blocking in a raise preparation structure. Other experiments are described in which low-density, lightweight concrete blocks were produced for mine ventilation doors, stoppings, and barricades. Other mine uses reviewed include pillars and collapsing beams. An advantage of low-density concrete is that it will display up to 50 % deformation at a constant yield stress. These hlllovative concepts in deformable concrete lining systems will aid mine operators by decreasing capital and maintenance costs, increasing the available space in underground haulageways, and providing productivity gains and improved resource recovery in the soft, caving, squeezing, or bursting grollnu conditions often found in deep mines...|$|E
40|$|Finalized Phase 2 - 3 {{project work}} has {{field-proven}} two separate real-time reservoir processes that were co-developed via funding by the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL). Both technologies are presently patented in the United States and select foreign markets; a downhole-commingled reservoir stimulation procedure and a real-time tracer-logged fracturing diagnostic system. Phase 2 and early Phase 3 project work included the research, development and well testing of a U. S. patented gamma tracer fracturing diagnostic system. This stimulation logging process was successfully field-demonstrated; real-time tracer measurement of fracture height while fracturing was accomplished and proven technically possible. However, {{after the initial}} well tests, there were several licensing issues that developed between service providers that restricted and minimized Realtimezone's (RTZ) ability to field-test the real-time gamma diagnostic system as was originally outlined for this project. Said restrictions were encountered after when one major provider agreed to license their gamma logging tools to another. Both of these companies previously promised contributory support toward Realtimezone's DE-FC 26 - 99 FT 40129 project work, however, actual support was less than desired when newly-licensed wireline gamma logging tools from one company were converted by the other from electric wireline into <b>slickline,</b> batter-powered ''memory'' tools for post-stimulation logging purposes. Unfortunately, the converted post-fracture measurement memory tools have no applications in experimentally monitoring real-time movement of tracers in the reservoir concurrent with the fracturing treatment. RTZ subsequently worked with other tracer gamma-logging tool companies for basic gamma logging services, but with lessened results {{due to lack of}} multiple-isotope detection capability. In addition to real-time logging system development and well testing, final Phase 2 and Phase 3 project work included the development of a real-time reservoir stimulation procedure, which was successfully field-demonstrated and is presently patented in the U. S. and select foreign countries, including Venezuela, Brazil and Canada. Said patents are co-owned by RTZ and the National Energy Technology Lab (NETL). In 2002, Realtimezone and the NETL licensed said patents to Halliburton Energy Services (HES). Additional licensing agreements (LA) are anticipated with other service industry companies in 2005. Final Phase 3 work has led to commercial applications of the real-time reservoir stimulation procedure. Four successfully downhole-mixed well tests were conducted with commercially expected production results. The most recent, fourth field test was a downhole-mixed stimulated well completed in June, 2004, which currently produces 11 BOPD with 90 barrels of water per day. Conducted Phase 2 and Phase 3 field-test work to date has resulted in the fine-tuning of a real-time enhanced stimulation system that will significantly increase future petroleum well recoveries in the United States and foreign petroleum fields, both onshore and offshore, and in vertical and horizontal wells...|$|E
