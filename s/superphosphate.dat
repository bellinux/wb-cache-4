Scientific literature over the past few years, however, shows that interest in the determination of sulphur in natural waters, soil and plant materials has been renewed. Perhaps the main reason for the non-recognition of the importance of sulphur as a plant nutrient is the fact that sulphur-deficiency seldom occurs since sufficient sulphur is usually added to the soil in rainfall (particularly near industrial towns) to supply all the sulphur requirements of plants. In addition, sulphur is frequently present in fertilizers added to soils to counteract deficiency in other elements, especially phosphorus. <b>Superphosphates,</b> for example contain up to 60 %, gypsum.

30|$|Based on this study, {{the average}} Cd in {{improved}} rice varieties were 85  µg/kg (median 55  µg/kg) whereas improved rice grains from wet zone had 128  µg/kg of Cd that is significantly higher compared to rice from the intermediate zone (54  µg/kg) and the dry zone (68  µg/kg) (Fig.  2 b). Mobilization of Cd in soil solution {{is sensitive to}} redox conditions in which mobilization is more favored under reducing conditions (Chuan et al. 1996). The heavy rainfall associated with the wet zone regions results in prolonged submerging of paddy soils resulting in extreme reducing conditions (Chandrajith et al. 2005 b). This facilitates the mobilization of Cd and the subsequent uptake of this by the rice plant. Dry zone paddy soils are irrigated at rates that prevent prolonged submergence that may facilitate binding of Cd into oxides and/or oxyhydroxides of Fe and Mn (Chuan et al. 1996). Phosphate fertilizers particularly <b>superphosphates</b> are the major host of Cd in rice paddy fields and from 2.3 to 46  mg/kg of Cd were reported in triple <b>superphosphates</b> in Sri Lanka (Chandrajith et al. 2010). Compared to white rice (70  µg/kg), red rice (123  µg/kg) had a significantly higher Cd level (Fig.  3 b) but the wet zone red rice showed a skewed distribution of Cd content from 9.6 to 576  µg/kg. Native rice varieties of Sri Lanka showed a mean Cd content of 33  µg/kg (median =  27  µg/kg) that is {{significantly lower than the}} improved varieties (Fig.  4). Application of organic fertilizer would be the reason for lower Cd content in native rice samples. The mean Cd content of rice in some neighboring countries are 78  µg/kg (India); 50  µg/kg (Nepal) and 27  µg/kg (Thailand), most of which are much lower than the Cd content in Sri Lankan rice (Meharg et al. 2009). However over 92  % of the improved rice samples collected from Sri Lanka contained Cd at a level less than the Codex Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants (CCFAC) maximum permissible level for rice grain of 200  µg/kg (FAO/WHO 2006). As already mentioned, rice is the staple diet of the Sri Lankan population that accounts for over 50  % of the dry diet that provides about 1000 calories. The average Cd intake from improved rice is 24  µg/day while wet zone rice provide 36  µg/day Cd which is significantly higher compared to intake from the dry zone (19  µg/day) and the intermediate zone (15  µg/day). The intake is lower (9.47  µg/day) for a person who consumes native rice (Table  2).|$|R
60|$|Phosphate of Lime.--As we {{have seen}} that the tentacles of the first set of leaves {{remained}} clasped for nine or ten days over minute fragments of bone, and the tentacles of the second set for six or seven days over the same fragments, I was led to suppose that it was the phosphate of lime, and not any included animal matter, which caused such long continued inflection. It is at least certain from what has just been shown that this cannot have been due to the presence of the fibrous basis. With enamel and dentine (the former of which contains only 4 per cent. of organic matter) the tentacles of two successive sets of leaves remained inflected altogether for eleven days. In order to test my belief in the potency of phosphate of lime, I procured some from Prof. Frankland absolutely free of animal matter and of any acid. A small quantity moistened with water was placed on the discs of two leaves. One of these was only slightly affected; the other remained closely inflected for ten days, when a few of the tentacles began to [page 110] re-expand, the rest being much injured or killed. I repeated the experiment, but moistened the phosphate with saliva to insure prompt inflection; one leaf remained inflected for six days (the little saliva used would not have acted for nearly so long a time) and then died; the other leaf tried to re-expand on the sixth day, but after nine days failed to do so, and likewise died. Although the quantity of phosphate given to the above four leaves was extremely small, much was left in every case undissolved. A larger quantity wetted with water was next placed on the discs of three leaves; and these became most strongly inflected in the course of 24 hrs. They never re-expanded; on the fourth day they looked sickly, and on the sixth were almost dead. Large drops of not very viscid fluid hung from their edges during the six days. This fluid was tested each day with litmus paper, but never coloured it; and this circumstance I do not understand, as the <b>superphosphate</b> of lime is acid. I suppose that some <b>superphosphate</b> must have been formed by the acid of the secretion acting on the phosphate, but that it was all absorbed and injured the leaves; the large drops which hung from their edges being an abnormal and dropsical secretion. Anyhow, it is manifest that the phosphate of lime is a most powerful stimulant. Even small doses are more or less poisonous, probably on the same principle that raw meat and other nutritious substances, given in excess, kill the leaves. Hence the conclusion, that the long continued inflection of the tentacles over fragments of bone, enamel, and dentine, is caused by the presence of phosphate of lime, and not of any included animal matter, is no doubt correct.|$|E
