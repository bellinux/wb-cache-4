Wild radish seeds contain up to 48% oil, and while not <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption,</b> this oil {{is a potential}} source of biofuel.

Slaves brought to America and the West Indies cooked cowpeas {{much the same way}} as they did in Africa, although many people in the American South considered cowpeas not <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption.</b> A popular dish was Hoppin' John, which contained black-eyed peas cooked with rice and seasoned with pork.

50|$|The {{first steps}} to truly {{transform}} the lupin into a contemporary, domesticated cropping plant {{were taken in}} the early 20th century. Pioneered by German scientists, their goal was to cultivate a ‘sweet’ variety of lupin {{that did not have}} the bitter taste (due to a mixture of alkaloids in the seed), making it more <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> both <b>human</b> <b>consumption</b> and animal feed.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, it {{had been}} known since 1748 that it was {{possible}} to artificially chill water with mechanical equipment and attempts were made in the late 1850s to produce artificial ice on a commercial scale. Various methods had been invented to do this, including Jacob Perkins's diethyl ether vapor-compression refrigeration engine, invented in 1834; engines that used pre-compressed air; John Gorrie's air cycle engines; and ammonia-based approaches such as those championed by Ferdinand Carré and Charles Tellier. The resulting product was variously called plant or artificial ice, but there were numerous obstacles to manufacturing it commercially. Producing plant ice required large amounts of fuel, in the form of coal, and capital for machinery, so producing ice at a competitive price was challenging. The early technology was unreliable and for many decades ice plants faced the risk of explosions and consequent damage to the surrounding buildings. Ammonia based approaches potentially left hazardous ammonia in the ice from where it had leaked through the joints of machinery. For most of the 19th century, plant ice was not as clear as much natural ice, sometimes left white residue when it melted and was generally regarded as less <b>suitable</b> <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>consumption</b> than the natural product.|$|E

High turbidity (haziness of water due to suspended particles) was added as an impairing factor in 2000. Sources of these impairments include Black Eagle Dam, upstream abandoned mines, irrigation runoff, industrial sources, and stormwater runoff.

40|$|Laetiporus sulphureus (chicken of the woods) is a wood {{decaying}} mushroom {{with positive}} medicinal and biological effects. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine its chemical composition including the main organic components (protein, fat, fibre, and ash contents, different protein fractions, the free amino acid level, soluble oligo- and polysaccharides, phenolics), the in vitro digestibility, the free radical scavenging activity, and twenty mineral elements. Our data demonstrate the characteristic in general valuable chemical composition of the mushroom Laetiporus sulphureus. Protein content in fruiting bodies is not too high (10. 6 % d. m.), but the biological value (in vitro digestibility, rate of protein fractions, free amino acid content, etc.) is good (including fat and energy levels). Occurrence of “bioactive” components (phenolics, soluble oligo- and polysaccharides) and the measured free radical scavenging activity are similar to these parameters in Pleurotus (oyster) species. Potassium and phosphorus contents are remarkable (28 940 mg kg − 1 d. m. and 4890 mg kg − 1 d. m., respectively); levels of some poisonous microelements (As, Cd, Cr) are very low or undetectable.

The triad of water resource management, socio- economic development and environmental sustainability are key issues that require balance and compromise. The effects of anthropogenic activities on the Blesbokspruit catchment were examined. Water samples were collected from nine strategically selected sites along the stream for a period of ten months in six weekly intervals and analysed for physio-chemical, selected trace metals and microbial entities. Results revealed that variables of concern were Electrical Conductivity (EC), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), Nitrates, Phosphates, Sulphates and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD). Mean levels of these parameters in this order ranged from 93. 0 - 146. 63 mS/m; 11. 25 - 39 mg/L; 0. 16 - 2. 01 mg/L; 0. 5 - 0. 96 mg/L; 118. 63 - 379. 5 mg/L and 15. 0 - 34. 0 mg/L respectively.

In the other one the precipitation of the most abundant milk proteins, caseins, was performed under acidic conditions by acetic acid at pH 4. 6, instead. The procedures were compared and proved to be partially complementary. Considered together they provided 1330 peptide identifications for donkey milk, mainly coming from the most abundant proteins in milk.
