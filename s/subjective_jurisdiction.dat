40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Each year, {{approximately}} 1, 500 Chinese youth migrate {{alone and}} clandestinely to the U. S. While most intend to advance {{themselves and their}} families socially and economically, not all are immediately successful: a number are apprehended and placed in removal proceedings. Here, immigration cause lawyers are tasked with presenting clients who might otherwise be termed "economic migrants" as uniquely vulnerable and deserving of legal status. Drawing on nearly three years of ethnographic research, this dissertation details the goals and responsibilities youth manage through multiple transitions of legality, labor and age alongside attorneys' negotiations of personal motivation and professional constraints. The "cause" that emerges, namely advocacy on behalf of unaccompanied Chinese youth, proves far-reaching and obligatory in largely unconsidered, and I believe unintended, ways. I argue that the lawyers in this study maintain their <b>subjective</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> (Abbott 1988) of this "cause" by constructing Chinese youth as uniquely vulnerable [...] and their parents as uniquely culpable [...] through normative narratives of age and morality alongside Orientalist economics and the "spectacular case. " Cause lawyers further establish their responsibility and, in a sense, worthiness to "treat" this population of migrants through a rhetoric of care [...] i. e. by ambiguously conflating "welfare and safety" with legal status, best interest with rights, and guardianship with legal representation. At the same time, however, the actions, expectations and very presence of Chinese clients unsettle these understandings of care. As I evidence, unaccompanied youth challenge presumptions of passivity or dependency by being "overtly agentful" (Coe, et. al 2008) in their management of migration journeys and legal needs. By attending to the legal strategies of attorneys and youth, this dissertation illuminates the limiting choices attorneys make on behalf of a "cause. " In so doing, it also points to the limited choices available to immigration cause lawyers, and thus to broader contradictions in the institutional practices, rights frameworks and political ideologies that govern the management and care of unaccompanied young migrants...|$|E
40|$|The {{intent of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} {{whether there is a}} place for low-income residents in gentrified neighborhoods by examining how the housing needs of these households are provided. Affordable housing development and maintenance are key components for preserving a place for low-income residents in gentrified communities. This paper investigates the provision of affordable housing through the renovation of the historic Whitelaw Hotel in Washington, D. C. by recreating the renovation events from interviews with participants in the project to document the obstacles to and benefits of the success of these projects. The paper also examines the issue of affordability and sustainability of affordable housing projects. Affordable is a <b>subjective</b> term. Local <b>jurisdictions</b> determine the income criteria that establish eligibility for affordable units. In many cities such as Washington, D. C., the area median income (AMI) used to determine eligibility is higher than the median income of the neighborhoods in which the affordable housing is located. A high AMI increases the number of households eligible for subsidized housing, which heightens competition for these units pitting very low-income households against households earning almost twice their income. Also, the sustainability of affordable units is contingent on man...|$|R
40|$|Jurisdiction is {{reflection}} from sovereignty state based principle, state degree {{similarity and}} no intervene principle one nation to another nation domestic affair. Jurisdiction state problem because of {{in an international}} society each nation is a sovereign member. Each nation which is involved with jurisdiction conflict obliged by international government to consider and pay attention some factor which is relates to implement jurisdiction enforcement. One of the example is jurisdiction conflict which is involvement between Indonesia and Australia about asylum territorial given by Australia government to 42 Papuans {{in the beginning of}} 2006. Evacuation which is having impact of giving asylum territorial for 42 Indonesian from Papua is a form of 42 Indonesian frightened regarding to threat arrest from Indonesia military. It may cause problem, the problem is legal or illegal the asylum territorial given by Australian government and also competence or incompetence for Indonesia as home nation of 42 Papuans to sent their back to Indonesia. In the final paper is used normative juridical method and data analyze technique in the form of analyze description. Asylum territorial given by Australia government based on section 1 subsection 1 declaration of united nation in 1967 about asylum territorial. Besides that, Australia as a committee nation convention in 1951 concerning to refugee status, having the obligation for giving protection for everyone (include 42 Indonesian from Papua) which is fulfill the refugee criteria according to section 1 subsection 2 convention. Indonesia as home nation of that 42 Papuans, it doesnâ€™t have authority to apply <b>subjective</b> territorial <b>jurisdiction</b> technical that is nation authority to carry out the demanding and to punished criminal act which is executed inside the self region, but those act will be finished and thorough in the region of another nation. This is caused by according to international law, these 42 Papuans include in a refugee category according to convention in 1951 and this convention occur the Non-Refoulement principle, this principle said that not to return the refugee to their home nation. Key word: Jurisdiction conflict, giving asylum territorial...|$|R
40|$|Performance based {{planning}} (PBP) is {{purported to}} be a viable alternative to traditional zoning. The implementation of PBP ranges between pure approaches that rely on predetermined quantifiable performance standards to determine land use suitability, and hybrid approaches that rely on a mix of activity based zones in addition to prescriptive and <b>subjective</b> standards. <b>Jurisdictions</b> in the USA, Australia and New Zealand have attempted this type of land use regulation with varying degrees of success. Despite the adoption of PBP legislation in these jurisdictions, this paper argues that a lack of extensive evaluation means that PBP is not well understood and the purported advantages of this type of planning are rarely achieved in practice. Few empirical studies have attempted to examine how PBP has been implemented in practice. In Queensland, Australia, the Integrated Planning Act 1997 (IPA) operated as Queensland's principal planning legislation between March 1998 and December 2009. While the IPA did not explicitly use the term performance based planning, the Queensland's planning system is widely considered to be performance based in practice. Significantly, the IPA prevented Local Government from prohibiting development or use and the term zone was absent from the legislation. How plan-making would be advanced under the new planning regime was not clear, and as a consequence local governments produced a variety of different plan-making approaches to comply with the new legislative regime. In order to analyse this variation the research has developed a performance adoption spectrum to classify plans ranging between pure and hybrid perspectives of PBP. The spectrum compares how land use was regulated in seventeen IPA plans across Queensland. The research found that hybrid plans predominated, and that over time a greater reliance on risk adverse drafting approaches created a quasi-prohibition plan, the exact opposite of what was intended by the IPA. This paper concludes that the drafting of the IPA and absence of plan-making guidance contributed to lack of shared understanding about the intended direction of the new planning system and resulted in many administrative interpretations of the legislation. It was a planning direction that tried too hard to be different, and as a result created a perception of land use risk and uncertainty that caused a return to more prescriptive and inflexible plan-making methods...|$|R
40|$|Juridical {{acts are}} drafted {{in order to}} create legal effects. Giving effect is, however, not always as easy as it might seem at first sight. During the {{execution}} of the juridical act, it frequently is unclear which obligations it actually entails. This lack of clarity results from the fact that juridical acts are concluded using a code, which is language. Because of the vagueness of expression or {{as a result of the}} indistinctness of language, the uttered intention is not always in agreement with the real one. Sometimes an expression has more than one meaning. Besides, words are never clear. They derive their meaning from a context. Therefore all communication, including every juridical act, needs to be interpreted. This PhD investigates the interpretation of juridical acts. All juridical acts volitional acts. Therefore, the governing interpretation criterion has to be the intention. When it comes to unilateral acts, the intention is the will of the party who undertakes a performance. When it comes to reciprocal acts, the intention is the common will of the contracting parties. Two different approaches can govern the search for the intention. One the one hand, one can argue that the real intention has to be decisive. A contract comes into being as a result of a consensus, and intention is also the base of every unilateral juridical act. On the other hand, one can reason that the written word is of overriding importance. It is the outward reflection of the intention, which the other party and third parties have become acquainted with. In some jurisdictions, the essential rule of interpretation is <b>subjective,</b> while other <b>jurisdictions</b> start from the premise that interpretation has to be fundamentally objective. In practice, however, all interpretative systems use subjective as well as objective components. This finding of course triggers the question: which interpretative system is the best one? This PhD investigates what a coherent and practicable system of interpretation of jurdical acts should look like, taking into account the autonomy of the parties on the one hand and legal certainty on the other hand. nrpages: 803 P. status: publishe...|$|R
