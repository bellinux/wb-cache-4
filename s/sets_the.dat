5|$|A COBOL {{program is}} split into four divisions: the {{identification}} division, the environment division, the data division and the procedure division.

Examples of such methodologies include the dinucleotide relative abundance approach by Willner et al. and the HabiSign approach of Ghosh et al. This latter study also indicated that differences in tetranucleotide usage patterns {{can be used to}} identify genes (or metagenomic reads) originating from specific habitats. Additionally some methods as TriageTools or Compareads detect similar reads between two read <b>sets.</b> <b>The</b> similarity measure they apply on reads is based on a number of identical words of length k shared by pairs of reads.|$|E
5|$|American Sign Language {{is growing}} in {{popularity}} among many states. Many people {{in high school and}} colleges wanting to take it as a foreign language, but until recently, it was not a creditable foreign language elective.

Their facial expressions and hand movements reflect what they are conveying. They also have their own sentence structure which <b>sets</b> <b>the</b> language apart.|$|E

5|$|Each team in {{the league}} has a manager, who is {{responsible}} for team strategy and leadership on and off the field.

In early baseball history, it was not uncommon for players to fill multiple roles as player-managers; specifically, they managed the team while still being signed to play for the club. The last player-manager in Major League Baseball was Pete Rose, who began managing the Cincinnati Reds in 1984.|$|E
