5|$|The {{drawing up}} {{of a regular}} season {{schedule}} had been a perennial source of contention among the NFL owners since the league's inception. The crux {{of the problem was}} the scheduling of games meant weighing the interest of owners who, early in the season, wanted their franchises to confront teams that drew the largest crowds, versus owners who wanted to play the weaker franchises to pad their team's win-loss record. The resultant impasse coerced the owners, in 1946, to confer upon Bell the <b>sole</b> <b>discretion</b> in developing the league's schedule. He utilized this responsibility to, early in the season, pit the weaker teams against other weak teams, and the strong teams against other strong teams. His goal was to augment game attendances by keeping the difference in team standings to a minimum as deep into the season as possible.|$|E
5|$|A {{standard}} adult football match {{consists of}} two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time. The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called additional time in FIFA documents, but is most {{commonly referred to as}} stoppage time or injury time, while loss time can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the <b>sole</b> <b>discretion</b> of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, {{towards the end of the}} half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee. Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between Stoke and Aston Villa. Trailing 1–0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90minutes had elapsed and the game was over. The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.|$|E

Worth noting is that: [...] "the mother's power and influence increase with the absence of the father, who is admitted to an asylum and spatially exiled.

40|$|In {{dealing with}} the problem of {{parallel}} proceedings, the research starts, in Chapter 1, with a description of the taxonomy of parallel proceedings (Paragraph 1. 1) and with an analysis of the most likely reasons behind the growth of this phenomenon (Paragraph 1. 2). Chapter 1 deeply analyses the already mentioned policy considerations at the basis of the research (Paragraph 1. 3). The following structure of the research follows the temporal sequence of the various phases of arbitration where the problem may emerge, namely jurisdiction, admissibility and post-award. The analysis starts – at Chapter 2 – by examining the jurisdictional stage, where, as it is demonstrated, there are no solutions to the problem of parallel proceedings. Indeed, this phase is based on the grundnorm of consent and there are no available legal tools that allow arbitrators to decline jurisdiction disregarding party autonomy (Paragraph 2. 1). Similarly, remedies based on a <b>sole</b> exercise of <b>discretion</b> (such as comity) are not reliable in order to find a predictable {{solution to the problem of}} parallel proceedings (Paragraph 2. 2). The research then moves to the analysis of the remedies available at the stage of admissibility. This methodologically imposes to preliminary deal with several other questions, such as the legal foundation of the distinction between jurisdiction and admissibility (Paragraph 3. 1), the analysis of the inherent powers (if any) of arbitrators to safeguard the interests of justice while administering their proceedings, and the law applicable in international investment arbitration (with a particular focus on the applicability of general principles of international law) (Paragraph 3. 2). We first of all demonstrate that international law provides us with some instruments in order to avoid parallel proceedings (not including lis pendens, as demonstrated in Paragraph 3. 3), namely the principles of good faith and finality (Paragraph 3. 4). These principles respectively furnish the grounds for the doctrine of abuse of process, on the one side, and res judicata and collateral estoppel, on the other side. It is then necessary to understand how and whether these tools may be applied in investment arbitration (Paragraphs 3. 5, 3. 6 and 3. 7). This requires, firstly, an analysis of these doctrines in international law and, secondly, a comparative analysis of how they have been applied in different municipal systems (with a particular focus on the distinction between civil law and common law systems). It finally emerges that such doctrines have been applied also in a flexible and substance-oriented way, which would be very helpful in order to limit parallel proceedings. This approach is, indeed, highly desirable. Chapter 3 also demonstrates how these doctrines may operate in concrete (Paragraph 3. 8) and put forward a proposal of amendment of rules of international arbitration in order to limit parallel proceedings and, at the same time, ensure the respect of due process (Paragraph 3. 9). Finally, remedies available at post-award stage will be examined in Chapter 4. These remedies are different with regard to ICSID awards – being ICSID a self-contained regime – and with regard to non-ICSID awards, which shall be enforced according to the provisions of the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. In the former case, we try to understand whether the remedy of annulment provided by the ICSID Convention may be useful in order to avoid the existence of two duplicative awards (Paragraph 4. 1). In the latter case the only available means to preclude the enforcement of a duplicative award is the public policy exception set forth in Art. V(2) (b) of the New York Convention. The analysis of the public policy exception involves several difficulties due to the involvement of municipal laws and courts and will require an examination of the national rules of private international law regulating the problem of conflicting judgments (Paragraph 4. 2). Finally, Paragraph 4. 3 tries to understand whether the existence of duplicative awards may be a ground for annulment at the place of the seat of arbitration...|$|R

And {{the said}} Warren Hastings, {{in his letter}} to the Court of Directors, dated Benares, the 15th of October, 1784, even after he had made the {{aforesaid}} renunciation of the Company's authority and influence to the Nabob, did write, [...] "that the Nabob, though most gentle in his manners, and endued with an understanding much above the common level, has been unfortunately bred up in habits that draw his attention too much from his own affairs, and often subject him to the guidance of insidious and unworthy confidants"; which, though more decently expressed with regard to the Nabob than in his former minutes, substantially agrees with them. And the said Warren Hastings did inform the Court of Directors, after he had solemnly covenanted to withdraw all the Company's influence on the assurances and promises of a person so by himself described, that, for reasons grounded on his knowledge of the imbecility of the character of the Nabob, he waited in a frontier town, [...] "that he might be at hand to counteract any attempt to defeat the effect of his proceedings at Lucknow"; and {{in his letter to}} Mr. Wheler from the same place he did write in the following words: [...] "I am still near enough to attend to the first effects of the execution, and to interfere with my influence for the removal of any obstructions to which they are or may be liable." [...] He therefore found that there was none or but an insufficient security to the effect of his treaty, but in his own direct personal violation of it. What otherwise was wanting in the security for the Nabob's engagements was to be supplied as follows: [...] "The most respectable persons of his family will be employed to counteract every other which may tend to warp him from it; and I am sorry to say that such assistance was wanting." [...] And in another letter, [...] "that he had equal ground to expect every degree of support which could be given it by the first characters of his family, who are warmly and zealously interested in it": the principal male character of the family, and of the most influence in that family, being Salar Jung, uncle to the Nabob; and the first female characters of the family being the mother and grandmother of the reigning sovereign: all of whom, male and female, he, the said Warren Hastings, in sundry letters of his own, in the transmission of various official documents, and even in affidavits studiously collected and sworn before Sir Elijah Impey during his short residence at Lucknow and Benares, did himself represent as persons entirely disaffected to the English power in India,--as having been principal promoters, if not original contrivers, of a general rebellion and revolt for the utter extirpation of the English nation,--and as such, he, the said Warren Hastings, did compel the Nabob reluctantly to take from them their landed estates; and yet the said Warren Hastings has had the presumption to attempt to impose on the East India Company by pretending to place his reliance on those three persons for a settlement favorable to the Company's interests, on his renunciation of all their own power, authority, and influence, and on his leaving their army to the <b>sole</b> and uncontrolled <b>discretion</b> of a stranger, meriting in his opinion the description given by him as aforesaid, as well as by him frequently asserted to be politically incapable of supporting his own power without the aid of the forces of the Company. And the offence of the said Warren Hastings, in abandoning a considerable part of the British army in the manner aforesaid, is much increased by the description which he has himself given {{of the state of the}} said army, and particularly of that part thereof which is stationed in the Nabob of Oude's dominions: for he did himself, on the 29th of November, 1781, transmit the information following, on that subject, to the Court of Directors, namely,--"that the remote stations of those troops, placing the commanding officers beyond the notice and control of the board [the Council-General] at Calcutta, afforded too much of opportunity and temptation for unwarrantable emoluments, and excited the contagion of peculation and rapacity throughout the whole army. A most remarkable instance and uncontrovertible proof of the prevalence of this spirit has been seen in the court-martial upon Captain Erskine, where the court, composed of officers of rank, and respectable characters, unanimously and honorably, (most honorably,) upon an acknowledged fact, acquitted him, which in times of stricter discipline would have been deemed a crime deserving the severest punishment." [...] From which representation (if the said Warren Hastings did not falsely and unjustly accuse and slander the Company's service) it appeared that the peculation which infected the whole army, derived from the taint which it had in Oude, and so fatal to the discipline of the troops, would be dangerously increased by his treaty and agreement aforesaid with the Nabob, and by his own said evil counsel to the Court of Directors.|$|R

I forbear to expatiate further on his character; it is sufficient that I am understood by the members of this board, who must know the truth of my allusions. Mr. Francis" [...] (a member of the board) [...] "surely was not aware of the injury he did me [Warren Hastings] by attributing to the spirit of party the character I gave Asoph ul Dowlah [the Nabob of Oude]; he himself knows it to be true; and it is one of those notorieties which supersede the necessity of any evidence. I was forced to the allusion I made by the imputation cast on this government, as having caused the evils which prevail in the government of the Nabob of Oude, which I could only answer by ascribing them to their true cause, the character and conduct of the Nabob of Oude." [...] And the Resident (appointed by the said Hastings, against the orders of the Court of Directors, as his particular confidential representative, one whom the said Nabob did himself request might be continued with him by an engagement in writing forever) did some time before, that is, on the 3d of January, 1779, assure the said Hastings and the Council-General, that [...] "such is his Excellency's [the Nabob of Oude's] disposition, and so entirely has he lost the confidence and affections of his subjects, that, unless some restraint is imposed on him which would effectually secure those who live under the protection of his government from violence and oppression, I am but too well convinced that no man of reputation or property will long continue in these provinces"; and that the said Resident proceeds to an instance of oppression and rapine, [...] "out of many of the Nabob's, which has caused a total disaffection and want of confidence among his subjects: he hoped the board would take it into their humane consideration, and interpose their influence, and prevent an act which would inevitably bring disgrace upon himself, and a proportionable degree of discredit on the national character of the English, which I consider to be more or less concerned in every act of his administration." ...|$|E
