2500|$|The {{potentially}} severe {{consequences for}} individuals who are found to have engaged in misconduct also reflect on the institutions that host or employ them and also on the participants in any peer review process that has allowed the publication of questionable research. [...] This means that a range of actors in any case may have a motivation to suppress any evidence or suggestion of misconduct. [...] Persons who expose such cases, commonly called whistleblowers, can find themselves open to retaliation {{by a number of}} different means. These negative consequences for exposers of misconduct have driven the development of whistle blowers charters - designed to protect those who raise concerns. A whistleblower is almost always alone in their fight - their career becomes completely dependent on the decision about alleged misconduct. [...] If the accusations prove false, their career is completely destroyed, but even in case of positive decision the career of the whistleblower can be under question: their reputation of [...] "troublemaker" [...] will prevent many employers from hiring them. There is no international body where a whistleblower could give their concerns. If a university fails to investigate <b>suspected</b> <b>fraud</b> or provides a fake investigation to save their reputation the whistleblower has no right of appeal.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2012 {{the company}} was {{required}} by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to improve its debt collection practices, after {{it was found that}} it had sent letters to customers in 2010 accusing them of committing fraud and saying that the police might be informed. Telephone scripts used by Wonga warned borrowers working in the public or financial sectors that their terms of employment said they should not be in debt. Wonga appealed the decision and said it believed it had grounds for suspecting dishonest conduct by the specific customers to whom letters had been sent, and that they had been sent on isolated occasions more than 18 months previously and had not been sent since. It stated that it had put in place procedures to make sure similar problems did not occur in future, and that since then it referred cases of <b>suspected</b> <b>fraud</b> to an in-house team to investigate. The phone scripts had not been used since January 2010, it said. In November 2013, after being challenged repeatedly by members of parliament in a Business, Innovation and Skills select committee hearing on pay day lenders, Wonga said that they had not been censured by the OFT, but had been asked to make various changes, and that criticism by the OFT was [...] "an open issue"; the company could not say more on an ongoing process. The practice of allowing debtors to [...] "roll on" [...] an existing loan was also called into question by the MPs.
