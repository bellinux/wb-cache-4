To allow himself to concentrate on his new position, he resigned all his company directorships, along with his post at MIT. He attended his first board meeting in Washington, DC, in his dinner jacket, having flown from Los Angeles after a <b>speaking</b> <b>engagement.</b> As head of a quasi-government organization, McCormack strove to employ the company's resources {{to carry out the}} policies of Congress and the President, and was able to persuade Congress to declassify plans for a domestic satellite network so he could consult with the television networks. He retired as chairman due to ill health in 1970, although he remained a director.|$|E

25|$|In February, 1861, Abraham Lincoln {{travelled}} through Camden Station in February 1861, {{on his way}} to Washington, D.C. to be inaugurated as President of the United States. News of the Battle of Fort Sumter, {{beginning the}} Civil War, first reached Baltimore on April 12, 1861, at the B's Camden Station telegraph office. The following week, Union troops of the 6th Massachusetts Militia travelling south on the B barricaded themselves at Camden Station when they were attacked by Confederate sympathizers in the Baltimore riot of 1861. During the four-year conflict, the B's line between Baltimore and Washington, D.C. was the sole rail link between the Federal capitol and the North, resulting in a vital role for Camden Station as B's Baltimore terminal. Trainloads of wounded soldiers and Confederate POWs came through the station following the Battle of Antietam, west of Baltimore on September 17, 1862. President Lincoln changed trains at Camden Station on November 18, 1863 en route to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania to deliver the Gettysburg Address. Lincoln also used Camden Station on April 18, 1864 when he made an overnight visit to Baltimore for a <b>speaking</b> <b>engagement.</b> A year later, at 10a.m. on April 21, 1865, the assassinated president's nine-car funeral train arrived at Camden Station, the first stop on its slow journey from Washington to Springfield, Illinois, via the B and the Northern Central Railway's Baltimore-Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, line.|$|E
500|$|Livingstone faced further {{criticism}} {{following a}} television appearance {{in which he}} stated that the perpetrators of the 2005 London bombings carried out their actions as retribution for UK involvement in the Iraq War. In March 2016, Livingstone again courted controversy by comparing a hedge fund manager's £16,800 donation to Labour MP Dan Jarvis to [...] "Jimmy Savile funding a children's group"; it subsequently emerged that Livingstone himself had received £8,000 from a Bermuda-based hedge fund called Meditor for a <b>speaking</b> <b>engagement,</b> leading to accusations of hypocrisy. Livingstone responded that rather than [...] "double standards" [...] it was [...] "different standards", he was paid for a <b>speaking</b> <b>engagement</b> where he would have told the room {{of the need for}} the City to invest more in the economy, which he felt was distinct from taking a political donation from a hedge fund manager.|$|E

500|$|Some evangelicals criticized Zacharias' {{decision}} not to use this opportunity to directly address the [...] "deep and foundational" [...] differences between the historic Christian faith {{and that of the}} LDS church. He responded by asserting that Christians should not immediately condemn Mormonism's theological differences but [...] "graciously build {{one step at a time}} in communicating our faith with clarity and conviction". He said this is just as effective as showing someone the faults of their faith. The <b>speaking</b> <b>engagement</b> was nearly sabotaged by a claim by event organizer Greg Johnson, president of Standing Together, that Zacharias had nothing to do with editing the book The Kingdom of the Cults and had only loaned his name to the latest edition. Johnson later apologized for his comment.|$|E
500|$|Johansson also {{campaigned for}} Democratic {{candidate}} Barack Obama. Her endeavors included appearances in Iowa during January 2008, where her efforts were targeted at younger voters, an appearance at Cornell College, and a <b>speaking</b> <b>engagement</b> at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, on Super Tuesday, 2008. Johansson {{appeared in the}} music video for rapper will.i.am's song, [...] "Yes We Can" [...] (2008), directed by Jesse Dylan, a song inspired by Obama's speech following the 2008 New Hampshire primary. In February 2012, Johansson and Anna Wintour hosted a fashion launch of pro-Obama clothing, bags, and accessories, whose proceeds went to the President's re-election campaign. She addressed voters at the Democratic National Convention in September 2012, calling for Obama's reelection and for more engagement from young voters. She specifically encouraged women to vote for Obama and condemned Mitt Romney for his opposition to Planned Parenthood.|$|E
500|$|Silverman was {{an outspoken}} proponent for Israeli statehood, {{traveling}} throughout the Americas and Europe advocating for a Jewish homeland. She depicted the Jews who had resettled in Palestine as simple farmers, seeking an agrarian life {{to alleviate the}} hunger they had experienced elsewhere. Silverman stressed that the settlers' intent was not to industrialize and vie with the international powerhouse nations, but simply {{to provide for their}} basic needs. Throughout 1927 and 1928, her itinerary included a <b>speaking</b> <b>engagement</b> in Savannah, Georgia with Sir Wyndham Deedes, prior chief secretary of Palestine; a tour of hospitals, clinics and public health programs in the Holy Land to determine how Hadassah could improve the health of the entire region, [...] "without regard to race or creed"; and attendance at the World Zionist Congress in Basel, Switzerland. Silverman resigned from Hadassah in 1928 in a policy dispute over the high salaries being paid to administrators rather than using the funds for charitable works.|$|E
