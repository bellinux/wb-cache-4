40|$|This thesis first {{describes}} the reverse method of transformer design. An existing magnetic model for full-core <b>shell-type</b> <b>transformers,</b> based on circuit theory, is summarised. A magneto-static {{finite element model}} is introduced and two sample transformers are analysed. The magnetic model based on finite element analysis is shown to be more accurate than the model based on circuit theory. Partial-core resonant transformers are then introduced and their characteristics are explained using an equivalent circuit model. A method of measuring the winding inductances under resonant operation is developed and used to investigate the characteristics of two different tuning methods. A finite element model of the partial-core resonant transformer is developed by adopting the model for full-core <b>shell-type</b> <b>transformers.</b> The model results accurately match the measured inductance variation characteristics of three sample transformers and predict the onset of core saturation in both axial-offset and centre-gap arrangements. A new design of partial-core resonant transformer is arrived at, having an alternative core and winding layout, as well as multiple winding taps. The finite element model is extended to accommodate the new design and a framework of analysis tools is developed. A general design methodology for partial-core resonant transformers with fixed inductance is developed. A multiple design method is applied to obtain an optimal design for a given set of specifications and restrictions. The design methodology is then extended to devices with variable inductance. Three design examples of partial-core resonant transformers with variable inductance are presented. In the first two design examples, existing devices are replaced. The new transformer designs are significantly lighter and the saturation effects are removed. The third design example is a kitset for high-voltage testing, with the capability to test any hydro-generator stator in New Zealand. The kitset is built and tested in the laboratory, demonstrating design capability. Other significant test results, for which no models have yet been developed, are also presented. Heating effects in the core are reduced by adopting an alternative core construction method, where the laminations are stacked radially, {{rather than in the}} usual parallel direction. The new kitset is yet {{to be used in the}} field...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} using aluminum electromagnetic shields in a distribution transformer. The goal of placing electromagnetic shields in the distribution transformer tank walls {{is to reduce the}} stray losses. A 500 kVA <b>shell-type</b> <b>transformer</b> is used. The overall results presented in this research work indicate that stray losses can be considerably reduced when electromagnetic shielding is applied to the transformer tank. In the experiment, the walls of the steel tank of the transformer were lined with aluminum foil. A section of this paper is devoted to the characterization of stray losses against the transformer rating (kVA) and the stray losses over load losses against the transformer rating (kVA). The experimental data presented in this work, will be helpful for a practicing engineer in the transformer industry. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} the design of <b>shell-type,</b> single-phase distribution <b>transformers</b> to obtain the manufacturing specifications. The method is simple, efficient and accurate. By an exhaustive analysis, it is concluded that the obtained solution is the global optimum. The following constraints are imposed: excitation current, no-load losses, total losses, impedance and efficiency. The methodology of this paper requires only six input data: transformer rating, low voltage, high voltage, connection of low-voltage coil, connection of high-voltage coil, and frequency. These data are included in the transformer nameplate. In this paper, the minimization of the following four objective functions is considered: total owing cost, mass, total losses and material cost. The consideration of these four objective functions is implemented automatically by running the optimization algorithm four times without intervention of a designer. Consequently, transformer manufacturers save designman-hours and increase capacity. A design example on a 25 kVA transformer is presented for illustration. The optimized solutions of transformer design are validated with laboratory and process measurements. © Springer-Verlag 2011...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{design of}} a 1 MW, 20 kHz, isolated, {{bidirectional}} 12 kV to 1. 2 kV DC-DC converter for renewable energy applications is presented. The main topics addressed are: High-Voltage (HV) side switch, topology & modulation and Medium Frequency (MF) transformer. A study of the possible HV side switches, considering 4. 5 kV IGBTs is performed, fixing the requirements from the topology and modulation side {{in order to reach}} a highly efficient system. The studied topologies are the Dual Active Bridge (DAB) with triangular modulation and the Series Resonant Converter (SRC) with constant frequency operation. Both topologies are able to achieve Zero Current Switching (ZCS) in the HV side switches, reducing the switching losses in these devices, which contribute to a large share to the system losses. Efficiency curves are presented for different semiconductor technologies for the Low-Voltage (LV) side switch in order to study the trade-offs between the selected topologies. Three MF transformer concepts, namely core-type, <b>shell-type</b> and matrix <b>transformer,</b> are presented and compared in respect of winding arrangement, isolation mechanisms and thermal management. Power losses and volume are calculated in each case and used to compare the different transformer concepts. I...|$|R
