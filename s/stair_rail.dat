2500|$|For Rodriguez's and Carano's {{fight in}} the London Underground, {{producers}} refused to let the pair attempt a stunt where their characters battle over a <b>stair</b> <b>rail</b> and fall down a stairwell, fearing a serious injury would derail filming; stunt women performed the practical stunt. Morgan's scripted rendition of the fight {{was described as a}} catfight on steroids, but Rodriguez provided input to turn it into more of a street fight. Rodriguez said: [...] "Originally in the script, it was a lot more 'Terminator'-esque — too far-fetched to be believed... Things just happened so quick and then I'm on top? Justin and I had to bust our booties to get it more realistic. I was like, 'This [...] needs to kick my ass!'" [...] Rodriguez and Carano rehearsed their fight choreography over two months, with trained fighter Carano undergoing extra practice to ensure her strikes looked credible without hitting hard enough to harm Rodriguez. Under the direction of fight choreographer Olivier Schneider, the fight was designed to be brutal but realistic, representing Carano's [...] "cop with fight training" [...] and Rodriguez's street fighting.|$|E

50|$|Noted as a {{fine example}} of Neoclassical Revival style or Beaux Arts (fine arts) {{architecture}} that flourished, 1885-1920, this impressive building is still widely known for its exceptional beauty. Beaux Arts combines ancient Greek and Roman forms with Renaissance ideas and is an eclectic Neoclassical style. Design suggests interlinking philosophy of justice: four identical entrances complement interior columns leading to justice; an intricate iron <b>stair</b> <b>rail</b> suggests delicate balance and the frailties of man.|$|E
50|$|The {{stone masonry}} support walls have arches between rooms. Each {{of the first}} three floors above the {{basement}} have terrazzo floors, marble wainscoting and oak woodwork, and the stairs have marble treads.

50|$|In 1912, {{he bought}} the Château d'Artigny near Tours {{and set out to}} rebuild it. Over a period of 20 years, Coty rebuilt d'Artigny in a grandiose fashion, {{installing}} custom-built kitchens, ballrooms, and a large fresco depicting himself, his family, friends, and even his mistresses. During the 1920s, he resided with his family in a mansion at Avenue Raphael in the Bois de Boulogne, which Coty had rebuilt with etched-glass panels, a <b>stair</b> <b>rail,</b> and a glass ceiling designed by Lalique.|$|E
50|$|Inside {{the house}} follows a central hall plan with large {{rooms in the}} front on either side and smaller ones in back that has been {{minimally}} altered. Most of the interior trim is restrained. Doors are paneled on only one side, and the cherry <b>stair</b> <b>rail</b> has no additional finish. The most decorated piece {{in the house is}} one of the parlor fireplaces, which has carved in its mantelpiece swags flanking a central urn under the shelf with garlands hanging down the flanking pilasters. The firebox complements this with a gray marble surround. Picture windows {{have been added to the}} rear of both first floor rooms.|$|E
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{architecture of}} the Thomas T. Gaff House {{is an example of}} a 17th-century Châteauesque manor, but only two rooms in the house follow French style. Gaff instructed the designers to include novel conveniences such as a hot-air system to dry clothes, a trapdoor to his icehouse so that deliveries could be made directly from the street, and cork insulation for his wine cellar. The interior features a mixture of 17th- and 18th-century designs. The main hall and dining room are lined with wooden paneling, Elizabethan wainscoting, and a sideboard that was originally used in an Italian monastery. The reception hall, which at one time doubled as a living room, contains a wooden <b>stair</b> <b>rail</b> with baroque scrollwork and walls that are covered with Louis XIII-style oak panelling. The drawing room resembles 18th-century interior design with lighter wood used for panelling and basic geometric lines.|$|E
50|$|The {{doors on}} the extreme corners of the porch lead upstairs. The rare, slender <b>stair</b> <b>rails,</b> {{supported}} by square balusters, are distinctive from the late 1700s. The rail ends in a pronounced upturn. Along the walls may be seen New England-style tapered posts supporting the ceiling. These are called “gunstock” posts, due to their shape. The rough-hewn beams, over 200 years old, are visible from this room, {{as well as the}} original wood surrounding the windows.|$|R

Of the pews, those in the center are freestanding, and larger than those on the sides; these have been angled slightly and attached to the side walls. There is a gallery in the south wall, with one center aisle and two down its sides. It is supported by a pair of Doric columns on the side walls, as well as by a number of pilasters. There is a dentiled entablature, set above the columns and topped by a railing with turned balusters. Entry to the gallery is achieved via an enclosed stairway on the east side; one wall is fitted with beaded diagonal paneling, and there is no <b>stair</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|E

40|$|Ten Steps to Heaven formed part of Fourteen Artists' Interventions, an {{exhibition}} held {{to mark the}} Swedenborg Society’s bicentennial celebration – {{a series of events}} including publications, lectures and presentations by writers including Simon Armitage, Iain Sinclair and A. S. Byatt. My contribution was a <b>stair</b> <b>rail</b> designed to have specific resonance to the site. Created for the bicentenary year, during which visitors encountered it as they moved through the building, my installation is now permanently in place and has been experienced by a diverse audience visiting the society {{for a wide range of}} reasons, visitors who may not normally engage with the visual arts. The installation plays on ideas about seeing and knowledge, particularly the notion of spiritual vision and illumination coming out of a period of metaphorical darkness. The handrail charts a physical journey through the architectural space of the building but also embodies the metaphor of spiritual descent and ascent described in St John of the Cross' poem, 'The Dark Night of the Soul' and explored by Emanuel Swedenborg. This project enabled me to build on and develop my research about peripheries and margins, by embodying a text in an architectural space. As with the motorway verge or car park, the stairwell is a functional, overlooked but crucial space through which we pass en route to other seemingly more significant destinations. This site-specific intervention developed and opened up exciting future possibilities in terms of situating my work within a wider range of locations. It was accompanied by an artist's book, containing visual representations of the work and its setting and an artist's conversation with writer Amy Halliday reflecting on the project's development. This was the first art exhibition to be held at the Swedenborg Society and was strongly publicised. It ran from February 25 th to March 5 th 2010.

50|$|Low {{lighting}} {{levels may}} contribute to slips, trips and falls in the elderly by lowering visibility of hazards such as unexpected steps, or sudden changes in floor surfaces. Obstacles to a safe passage may include clutter or ill-placed furniture, which can cause a slip or a trip. Grab bars and <b>stair</b> <b>rails</b> are obvious aids but must be visible to the user, and so such environments demand strong lighting. Falls of elderly people causes {{a significant number of}} hip joint fractures, replacement of which is a serious medical event. Depending on fall configuration, other bones may be fractured. Head injury is also possible. Falls from ladders are very common among the elderly, especially men, with potentially worse injuries owing to the greater heights involved.|$|R

The house is divided longitudinally along its gable ridge into two units, and presents two five-bay fronts to the east and west. A 1-1/2 story wood frame addition extends to the north, continuing this division. Each unit has two chimneys at the ends of the main block, and a third in the ell. The entrances are set in recessed openings at the centers of the facades, and appear to be early 20th-century Colonial Revival replacements.
