Like {{the other members of}} the Politburo, he lived until 1960 in a <b>secured</b> <b>area</b> of East Berlin's {{district}} Pankow and moved in 1960 to the Waldsiedlung near Wandlitz. In Pankow he had lived in Majakowskiring. In 1963, Rau's widow Elisabeth moved to this street again.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the heavy security, {{businesses}} around the tower had seen decreased patronage due to less foot traffic around the heavily <b>secured</b> <b>area.</b> Protests around the tower subsided after his inauguration in January 2017, and by summer 2017, the security measures around the tower had been loosened somewhat, owing to the fact that most security measures were implemented only when Trump was actually in the tower. However, several businesses at the tower's base had closed by then because of a {{reduction in the number of}} customers.|$|E
25|$|Sydney Airport has road {{connections}} in all directions. Southern Cross Drive (M1), a motorway, {{is the fastest}} link with the city centre. The M5 South Western Motorway (including the M5 East Freeway) links the airport with the south-western suburbs of Sydney. A ring road runs around the airport consisting of Airport Drive, Qantas Drive, General Holmes Drive, M5 East Freeway and Marsh Street. General Holmes Drive features a tunnel under the main north-south runway and three taxiways {{as well as providing}} access to an aircraft viewing area. Inside the airport a part-ring road– Ross Smith Avenue (named after Ross MacPherson Smith)– connects the Domestic Terminal with the control tower, the general aviation area, car-rental company storage yards, long-term car park, heliport, various retail operations and a hotel. A perimeter road runs inside the <b>secured</b> <b>area</b> for authorised vehicles only.|$|E

25|$|The {{connection}} between the two flights at Logan International Airport was within Terminal B, but the two gates were not connected within security. Passengers must leave the <b>secured</b> <b>area,</b> go outdoors, cross a covered roadway, and enter another building before going through security once again. There are two separate concourses in Terminal B; the south concourse is mainly used by US Airways and the north one is mostly used by American Airlines. It had been overlooked that there would still be a security screen to pass in Boston because of this distinct detail of the terminal's arrangement. At 6:45am, while at the Boston airport, Atta took a call from Flight 175 hijacker Marwan al-Shehhi. This call was apparently to confirm that the attacks were ready to begin. Atta checked in for American Airlines Flight 11, passed through security again, and boarded the flight. Atta was seated in business class, in seat 8D. At 7:59am, the plane departed from Boston, carrying 81 passengers.|$|E
25|$|Dziekański's {{flight was}} two hours late, {{and arrived at}} about 3:15 pm on October 13, 2007. According to {{official}} sources, Dziekański required language support to complete initial customs formalities. After he completed initial immigration processing, his whereabouts between 4:00 p.m. and about 10:45 p.m. remain unclear, though at various points he was seen around the baggage carousels. Dziekański's mother, Zofia Cisowski, {{had told him to}} wait for her at the baggage claim area but it was a <b>secured</b> <b>area</b> where she was not allowed to enter. At 10:45 p.m., when he attempted to leave the Customs hall, he was directed again to secondary immigration as his visa had not yet been processed. Dziekański's immigration procedures were completed at about 12:15 a.m. on October 14. After 30 minutes in an immigration waiting area, he was taken to the international arrivals reception area. Cisowski had been making enquiries of airport staff since the early afternoon. Airport staff told her Dziekański was not at the airport and she had returned to Kamloops at about 10 p.m., believing her son had missed his flight.|$|E
25|$|On 21 May 2009, Dragan Marić, {{a former}} {{businessman}} who was revolted over the court decision in his {{dispute with the}} national air carrier Jat Airways, entered the Presidency office carrying two hand grenades and seeking an out-of-court settlement signed by President or Government. Members of the Battalion of Military Police Cobras, providing security to the President of Serbia, managed {{to take one of}} the grenades immediately and isolate the attacker, however the perpetrator removed the pin from the second grenade and threatened to detonate it by releasing the lever. The negotiations were handled by the special team of the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs, supported by the officials of the Ministry of Justice, and lasted for several hours until the man was disarmed and arrested. After the incident, Tadić, who was present in the <b>secured</b> <b>area</b> of the building, congratulated the police and army special units, the security and negotiation team for doing a terrific job, peacefully and with no casualties and also said that problems, no matter what kind, cannot be resolved by force and by jeopardising citizens' lives.|$|E

2500|$|DFW's {{terminals}} {{are designed}} to minimize the distance between a passenger's car and airplane, and to reduce traffic around terminals.

The original people mover train (Airtrans APM, later the American Airlines TrAAin) which opened with the airport was notoriously slow (...) , uni-directional (running only in a counter-clockwise direction) and was located outside the <b>secured</b> <b>area</b> (thus requiring travelers to go through the security process again).
