50|$|Dežman {{began his}} {{political}} career in the <b>Slovene</b> <b>National</b> Movement, but in the mid-1850s, he became alienated from it, disenchanted with the conservatism and pragmatism of its leaders Janez Bleiweis and of Lovro Toman. Nevertheless, he was elected as a Slovene nationalist MP at the Austrian Parliament in 1861. He however did not join the <b>Slovene</b> <b>national</b> caucus, but joined the Bohemian federalists. He supported the peaceful coexistence of Slovene and German culture in the Slovene Lands. In 1862, Dežman's break with the <b>Slovene</b> <b>national</b> movement became manifest when he published a brochure entitled 'The German Culture in Carniola' (Das Deutschtum in Krain), in which he argued {{it is the duty}} of German culture to civilize and bring economic and political progress to Carniola, without Germanizing it.|$|R
50|$|In 1855, {{he moved}} to Ljubljana, where he opened a legal practice. He joined the <b>Slovene</b> <b>National</b> Movement, {{and became one of}} the leaders of its {{conservative}} stream.

Between 1864 and 1869, he served as the first Slovene nationalist mayor of Ljubljana; when he was elected in June 1864, the <b>Slovene</b> <b>national</b> flag was flown on the Ljubljana town hall. His mayorship was utterly unsuccessful, and helped to lay the path to the Austrian Centralist victory in the elections of 1869. After the late 1860s, Costa became one of the most unpopular <b>Slovene</b> <b>national</b> politicians, and the main target of criticism by the <b>national</b> liberal Young <b>Slovenes.</b>|$|R
