5|$|Following {{the issues}} with the {{publishing}} of Killing Time, there was increased oversight by Roddenberry's staff regarding the novels published by Pocket Books. This was delegated to Arnold, and would later cause confusion for Pocket Books as comments would be sent back and it was sometimes unclear whether they were from Roddenberry or Arnold. These comments rejected plot developments in the novels where they were <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> of the bounds set by the television series. Rumours subsequently spread {{that there was an}} alternative version of the manuscript with more explicit Kirk/Spock slash details, something that Van Hise later denied.|$|E
5|$|After <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> of the TARDIS in modern-day Colchester, the Doctor {{is blown}} {{off his feet}} by a blast of air, and the TARDIS, Amy still inside, dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to rematerialise. With Amy's help, the Doctor tracks the {{disturbance}} {{to the second floor}} of a house. The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to determine what is present on the second floor without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the Doctor are aware that people are being lured off the street to the second floor flat and never leaving again, but the Doctor is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the second floor.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a new class}} of relaxed {{sequencing}} games is introduced: the class of <b>Step</b> <b>out</b> - <b>Step</b> in sequencing games. In this relaxation any player within a coalition is allowed to <b>step</b> <b>out</b> from his position in the processing order and to step in at any position later in the processing order. Providing an upper bound on the values of the coalitions we show that every <b>Step</b> <b>out</b> - <b>Step</b> in sequencing game has a non-empty core. This upper bound is a sufficient condition for a sequencing game to have a non-empty core. Moreover, this paper provides a polynomial time algorithm to determine the coalitional values of <b>Step</b> <b>out</b> - <b>Step</b> in sequencing games...|$|R

5|$|While nine innings {{has been}} the {{standard}} {{since the beginning of}} professional baseball, the duration of the average major league game has increased steadily through the years. At the turn of the 20th century, games typically took {{an hour and a half}} to play. In the 1920s, they averaged just less than two hours, which eventually ballooned to 2:38 in 1960. By 1997, the average American League game lasted 2:57 (National League games were about 10 minutes shorter—pitchers at the plate making for quicker outs than designated hitters). In 2004, Major League Baseball declared that its goal was an average game of 2:45. By 2014, though, the average MLB game took over three hours to complete. The lengthening of games is attributed to longer breaks between half-innings for television commercials, increased offense, more pitching changes, and a slower pace of play with pitchers taking more time between each delivery, and batters <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> of the box more frequently. Other leagues have experienced similar issues. In 2008, Nippon Professional Baseball took steps aimed at shortening games by 12 minutes from the preceding decade's average of 3:18.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{standing}} in a room wearing a white wedding dress. Holding a bouquet of red rose, she is surrounded by her bridesmaids as they prepare for her wedding. She sits down on a sofa and sees a wedding photo of her fiancé with another woman as a storm begins to form outside. The bridesmaids try to close the windows but fail so they {{run out of the}} room leaving Clarkson alone, who is seen dropping the bouquet of rose as well as the wedding photo from her hands onto the floor. The next scene shows Clarkson walking down the aisle in a church wearing a black dress. She sees a bride standing at the altar with her fiancé, getting married. When she draws the veil of the bride, she realizes that the bride is the woman from the photo. Clarkson, who is now wearing a white wedding dress, runs out of the church and into a dark swamp. A montage of Clarkson singing with her band in a dark swamp is shown alternately with scenes of Clarkson running in the forest and laying on the ground. Clarkson is also seen standing inside an abandoned house, wearing a voluminous black dress. As the rain starts to fall, Clarkson finally collapsed, kneeling on the ground while looking at and being comforted by her other self who is singing with the band. The scene shifts to a present day, where Clarkson is standing at the altar, exchanging vows with her fiancé. Before he puts the ring on her finger, she looks at the guests and notices that the woman from the photo is among the audience. She sees her fiancé exchanging a smile with the woman as the woman blows him a kiss. Clarkson then reaches for the ring and throws it at her fiancé, before running away from the altar. She throws her wedding bouquet into the lap of the woman and shoves her way past the wedding guests who are trying to stop her from leaving. The video ends with Clarkson <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> the doors into the bright sunlight.|$|E

25|$|The Council of Trent (1545–1563) {{objected to}} the {{floating}} or hovering depictions, and demanded {{a return to the}} older conception, with Christ's feet firmly on the ground, either <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> of a sarcphagus, or standing upright, holding a banner. This was generally followed, at least until the 19th century. However, Tintoretto's 1565 depiction at his former parish church of San Cassiano (Venice) still shows the figure of Christ as floating above the tomb.|$|E

25|$|After two {{incomplete}} {{passes to}} begin the drive, Vick escaped a blitz by scrambling to his left for 33 yards before <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> of bounds at the Eagles' 45-yard line. A pass to Avant and another scramble by Vick set the Eagles up at the 20-yard line at the two-minute warning. Facing second and three from the 13-yard line, Vick passed to Maclin on the left side, and Maclin shook a tackle from CB Terrell Thomas and reached the end zone, tying the game at 31–31 with 1:16 remaining.|$|E
25|$|In another tale, Amaterasu retreats from {{conflict}} {{with her brother}} Susa No O into a cave, depriving the Earth of sunlight and life. In order to coax Amaterasu from the cave, the deity of humour and dance, Ame No Uzume, performs a bawdy sexual dance that involved exposing her breast and vulva, and inviting Amaterasu to admire them. On Amaterasu's <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> of the cave, the transgender kami Ishi Kori Dome held up a magical mirror, and {{the combination of the}} dance and her reflection fascinate Amaterasu so much that she does not notice other spirits closing the cave entrance behind her.|$|E
25|$|In September 2013, Burton {{announced}} that he would be <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> of the No. 31 {{at the end of the}} season due to a lack of additional sponsorship. On September 9, it was {{announced that}} Ryan Newman will drive the No. 31 beginning in 2014, bringing sponsor Quicken Loans with him from Stewart-Haas Racing for 12 races. Kevin Harvick had transferred to Stewart-Haas Racing, Newman's previous team, essentially meaning the two drivers were switching teams, although they did not end up in the same rides. In spite of not winning a race, Newman made it to the final round of the new chase format, finishing second in points to Harvick, losing by just one point.|$|E
