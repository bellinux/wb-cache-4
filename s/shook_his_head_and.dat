5|$|Cornwallis {{refused to}} attend the {{surrender}} ceremony, citing illness. Instead, Brigadier General Charles O'Hara led the British army onto the field. O'Hara first attempted to surrender to Rochambeau, who <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> pointed to Washington. O'Hara then offered his sword to Washington, who also refused and motioned to Benjamin Lincoln. The surrender finally took place when Washington's second-in-command accepted the sword of Cornwallis' deputy.|$|E
500|$|Scurvy curs! {{they were}} my abhorrence; I should have liked {{nothing better than to}} have been the death of every one of them. In fact, on one occasion, I intimated the propriety of a canine crusade to Mehevi; but the benevolent king would not consent to it. He heard me very patiently; but when I had finished, <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> told me, in confidence, that they were [...] "taboo".|$|E
500|$|Smetana's friend Josef Srb-Debrnov, who {{was unable}} to attend the {{performance}} himself, canvassed opinion {{from members of the}} audience as they emerged. [...] "One praised it, another <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> one well-known musician ... said to me: 'That's no comic opera; it won't do. The opening chorus is fine but I don't care for the rest.'" [...] Josef Krejčí, a member of the panel that had judged Harrach's opera competition, called the work a failure [...] "that would never hold its own." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Stanfield {{worked to}} try to unify the party, Diefenbaker and his loyalists proved {{difficult}} to reconcile. The division in the party broke out in well-publicised dissensions, as when Diefenbaker called on Progressive Conservative MPs to break with Stanfield's position on a bilingualism bill, and nearly half the caucus voted against their leader or abstained. In addition to his parliamentary activities, Diefenbaker travelled extensively and began work on his memoirs, which were published in three volumes between 1975 and 1977. Pearson {{died of cancer in}} 1972, and Diefenbaker was asked if he had kind words for his old rival. Diefenbaker <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> said only, [...] "He shouldn't have won the Nobel Prize." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{serving as}} museum chair, Marcus was once called upon by Fred Florence, then {{chairman}} of a major local bank and a fellow Temple Emanu-El leader, to explain his inclusion of [...] "a lot of Communist art" [...] he'd been told would be included in an upcoming DMFA [...] "Sports in Art" [...] exhibit, co-sponsored by Sports Illustrated and United States Information Agency as a fund-raiser for the 1956 Olympic team. Artists represented in the show included four supposed Communist supporters, Leon Kroll, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Ben Shahn, and William Zorach. Asking Florence to indicate which pieces were being questioned, Marcus dismissed each claim one by one: [...] "I don't know how anybody could think hitting a baseball was communist," [...] Marcus said when shown Shahn's [...] "The National Pastime." [...] His response to Zorach's [...] "Fisherman" [...] was similar, as he <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> remarked, [...] "I don't think too many people think fishing is communist either." [...] Marcus followed up by going to local newspapers The Dallas Morning News and the Dallas Times-Herald and getting the publishers of both to agree {{that they would not}} stand for censorship in the arts.|$|E
500|$|While these {{preparations}} were underway, Fox kept wavering in {{its commitment}} to Avatar because of its painful experience with cost overruns and delays on Cameron's previous picture, Titanic, even though Cameron rewrote the script to combine several characters together and offered to cut his fee in case the film flopped. Cameron installed a traffic light with the amber signal lit outside of co-producer Jon Landau's office to represent the film's uncertain future. In mid-2006, Fox told Cameron [...] "in no uncertain terms that they were passing on this film," [...] so he began shopping it around to other studios, and approached Walt Disney Studios, showing his proof-of-concept to then-chairman Dick Cook. However, when Disney attempted to take over, Fox exercised its right of first refusal. In , Fox finally agreed to commit to making Avatar after Ingenious Media agreed to back the film, which reduced Fox's financial exposure to {{less than half of}} the film's official $237million budget. After Fox accepted Avatar, one skeptical Fox executive <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> told Cameron and Landau, [...] "I don't know if we're crazier for letting you do this, or if you're crazier for thinking you can do this..." ...|$|E

500|$|The Passamaquoddy tribal council fired Gellers {{and asked}} Tureen to take over. Fearing that his federally funded legal aid {{employer}} could not withstand the political pressure that the suit would inevitably provoke, in 1971, Tureen asked the Native American Rights Fund (NARF) {{to act as}} co-counsel. Tureen himself would eventually move to NARF {{during the course of}} the litigation. Tureen attempted to persuade a large law firm to join the case pro bono. Among those who turned him down were Arthur Lazarus, Jr. of Frank, Harris, Shriver & Kampelman, who had litigated many claims in front of the Indian Claims Commission. Based on the acreage involved, Lazarus pointed out that the claim would net only $300,000 before the Commission, which would be less than the cost of litigation. When Tureen said, [...] "Mr. Lazarus, this is not an Indian Claims Commission case, this is a Nonintercourse Act claim," [...] Lazarus <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> told Tureen he was dreaming. Tureen was able to recruit Barry Margolin, David Crosby, and Stuart Ross of Hogan & Hartson. The other members of the team were Robert Pelcyger of NARF and Robert Mittel of Pine Tree Legal Assistance.|$|E

I believe that he suffered death, but I cannot believe he suffered the shameful death on the cross." [...] Not long after, {{he came back to}} tell Judson, [...] "I have been trusting in my own reason, not the word of God…. I now believe the crucifixion of Christ because it is contained in scripture." ...|$|E
2500|$|Buffalo Bill {{would not}} discuss the killing of Chief American Horse at Slim Buttes He just <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> {{said it was too}} bad to talk about. While Cody did not {{participate}} in the Battle of Slim Buttes, he took a scalp at the Battle of Warbonnet Creek on July 17, 1876, in a skirmish characterized as a duel between Buffalo Bill and a young Cheyenne warrior named Yellow Hair. The engagement, {{often referred to as the}} [...] "First Scalp for Custer", was dramatized with Captain Jack in their consolidated theater act. [...] Buffalo Bill displayed the fallen warrior's scalp, feather war bonnet, knife, saddle and other personal effects. [...] However, scalping Indians become loathsome to Buffalo Bill.|$|E

2500|$|Earlier in the year, Austin had {{a change}} in character, {{becoming}} more emotional, and friendly with Vince. On the July 12 episode of SmackDown!, Vince said he needed the [...] "old" [...] Austin, an anti-hero tough character, to lead the WWF at Invasion. After Vince pleaded with him, Austin <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> left. During the July 16 episode of Raw is War, Austin was shown drinking in a bar. Later that night, a fight started between many WWF wrestlers, and WCW and ECW wrestlers. As WWF seemed to be disadvantaged, Austin arrived, {{and returned to his}} old character, fighting off the WCW and ECW wrestlers. The WWF wrestlers (Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, Kane, The Undertaker) then cleared out the ring, and were left standing tall.|$|E
2500|$|Stone Cold Steve Austin, who {{had turned}} heel at WrestleMania and formed an {{alliance}} with McMahon when he helped Austin win the WWF Championship, took a change in character during this time. Instead of being a beer-drinking redneck, he was more emotional and tried to cheer-up Vince McMahon, who was clearly stressed {{from the threat of}} The Alliance, by doing something generous like giving Vince a cowboy hat as a present. On the July 12 episode of SmackDown!, Austin played [...] "Kumbaya" [...] and [...] "We Are the Champions" [...] for McMahon, to which Vince was unresponsive. Later that night, Vince McMahon came out and asked Austin to come to the ring, announcing him as the man that would lead Team WWF into the pay-per-view and into victory. Upon entering, Vince McMahon told Austin that he had changed quite a bit since WrestleMania, and when the WWF goes up against The Alliance at the upcoming pay-per-view, he did not need an Austin that gave him hugs and gifts and baked him cookies. He needed the [...] "old" [...] Stone Cold who was a [...] "beer-swilling, foul-mouthed SOB" [...] and the [...] "old" [...] Stone Cold that [...] "didn't take shit from anyone". He asked Austin to knock him down, even yelling to the crowd, [...] "If you want Stone Cold to beat the living hell out of Vince McMahon, give me a hell yeah!" [...] to which the crowd responded enthusiastically. Austin, however, <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> proceeded to leave the ring, turning his back on Vince McMahon. Later that night when Diamond Dallas Page and Shane McMahon went up against the Undertaker and Kurt Angle, many members of the Alliance interfered. Kane and Jericho came to help their team, but the Alliance's numbers were too many, and without Austin to back up his teammates, Team WWF was overwhelmed.|$|E
2500|$|Brooke {{recorded}} in his war diary on 3 October 1941, that a messenger {{had arrived at}} midnight with orders to prepare a plan to attack Trondheim in one week {{and that he was}} to go to Chequers, the prime minister's country house, that evening to discuss the idea over dinner. Accordingly, Brooke together with General Sir John Dill, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Admiral Sir Dudley Pound, the First Sea Lord and Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Portal, the Chief of the Air Staff and Clement Attlee, the Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the Labour Party were also in attendance. Brooke recorded that [...] "We sat up til 2.15 pm discussing the problem and I did my best to put the PM off the plan" [...] and that they [...] "Resumed discussion at 11 am and went on till 1 pm, I think PM is beginning to weaken on the plan". Brooke was mistaken and later wrote: [...] "From then on, we would continually be in trouble riding him [...] off mad plans to go back to Norway. Why he wanted to go back and {{what he was going to}} do there, even if he did succeed in capturing Trondheim, we never found out". On 12 October, Brooke was required to present a detailed plan for the Norway invasion, now code named Operation Ajax, which he had compiled with Admiral Sir John Tovey, Air Chief Marshall Sir William Sholto Douglas and General Sir Bernard Paget (who was to command it). Churchill complained that it was not a plan but a [...] "masterly treatise" [...] on the difficulties of the venture. Churchill avoided the main reason (lack of air support) during two hours of interrogation; raising details such as why he forsaw frosts (as stated in the Climate Book) and why would it take 24 hours to go from A to B (because of enemy resistance and removing road blocks). According to one account (but not mentioned by Brooke) Brooke suddenly relented and agreed to mount the expedition on the condition that the navy could take the fleet into Trondheim Fjord in support, but the elderly Pound merely <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> ended the discussion. [...] Churchill again asked the Joint Planning Staff to reconsider Ajax without reference to Brooke or Paget, but the JPS, and the Chiefs of Staff, supported Brooke's conclusions, citing the lack of air superiority or any hope of achieving it.|$|E
