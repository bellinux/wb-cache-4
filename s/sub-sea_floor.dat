40|$|A {{possible}} {{effect of}} a carbon dioxide leak from an industrial <b>sub-sea</b> <b>floor</b> storage facility, utilised for Carbon Capture and Storage, is that escaping carbon dioxide gas will dissolve in sediment pore waters and reduce their pH. To quantify the scale and duration of such an impact, a novel, field scale experiment was conducted, whereby carbon dioxide gas was injected into unconsolidated <b>sub-sea</b> <b>floor</b> sediments for a sustained period of 37 days. During this time pore water pH in shallow sediment (5 mm depth) above the leak dropped > 0. 8 unit, relative to a reference zone that was unaffected by the carbon dioxide. After the gas release was stopped, the pore water pH returned to normal background values within a three-week recovery period. Further, the total mass of carbon dioxide dissolved within the sediment pore fluids above the release zone was modelled by the difference in DIC between the reference and release zones. Results showed that between 14 and 63 % of the carbon dioxide released during the experiment could remain in the dissolved phase within the sediment pore water...|$|E

40|$|The Red Sea between 22 °N and 25 °N is {{transitional}} {{between the}} southern Red Sea, where an axial rift valley with strong magnetic signature is almost continuous, and the Northern Red Sea where the axial valley and associated magnetic anomalies are absent. Segments of sediment-free axial trough with associated magnetic anomalies alternate with intertrough zones. The axial troughs and deeps are not aligned but show lateral offsets. The Nereus trough bas an axial rift valley morphology and is carpeted by basalts with MORB affinity, indicating emplacement of oceanic type crust; magnetic anomalies suggest sea floor spreading initiated about 2 - 3 m. y. b. p. at the Nereus segment, but only 1 m. y. b. p. at the segment's northern tip, the implications being that Nereus is a mini-propagating oceanic rift.

Estimation of the peak P-T conditions was performed via calculations of pseudosections representing the equilibrium assemblages in the studied rocks using THERMOCALC. These calculations yielded relatively uniform values for the high-pressure metamorphic equilibration, with temperatures of 550 ± 60 °C and pressures of 2. 1 ± 0. 3 Gpa, higher than the previously estimated P-T in the St. Marcel Valley (T max = 500 °C and P max = 1 - 4 GPa), but lower than those obtained in other localities of the Zermatt-Saas zone (T up to 550 - 600 ° C and P up to 2. 5 - 3. 0 GPa).

40|$|Because of {{the paucity}} of exposed rock the direct {{physical}} record of Antarctic Cenozoic glacial history has become known only recently and then largely from off-shore shelf basins through seismic surveys and drilling. The number of holes has been small and largely confined to three areas (McMurdo Sound, Prydz Bay and Antarctic Peninsula), but even in McMurdo Sound, where Oligocene and early Miocene strata are well-cored, the Late Cenozoic is poorly known and dated.

40|$|Bioturbation {{by humans}} (‘anthroturbation’), {{comprising}} phenomena ranging from surface landscaping to boreholes that penetrate {{deep into the}} crust, is a phenomenon without precedent in Earth history, being orders of magnitude greater in scale than any preceding non-human type of bioturbation. These human phenomena range from simple individual structures to complex networks that range to several kilometres depth (compared with animal burrows that range from centimetres to a few metres in depth), while the extraction of material from underground can lead to topographic subsidence or collapse, with concomitant modification of the landscape. Geological transformations include selective removal of solid matter (e. g. solid hydrocarbons, metal ores), fluids (natural gas, liquid hydrocarbons, water), local replacement by other substances (solid waste, drilling mud), associated geochemical and mineralogical changes to redox conditions with perturbation of the water table and pH conditions and local shock-metamorphic envelopes with melt cores (in the case of underground nuclear tests). These transformations started in early/mid Holocene times, {{with the beginning of}} mining for flint and metals, but show notable inflections associated with the Industrial Revolution (ca 1800 CE) and with the ‘Great Acceleration’ at ∼ 1950 CE, the latter date being associated with the large-scale extension of this phenomenon from sub-land surface to <b>sub-sea</b> <b>floor</b> settings. Geometrically, these phenomena cross-cut earlier stratigraphy. Geologically, they can be regarded as a subsurface expression of the surface chronostratigraphic record of the Anthropocene. These subsurface phenomena have very considerable potential for long-term preservation. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{reconnaissance}} {{survey of the}} 1000 Km^ 2 of Masirah Island, Oman, has revealed a fully-developed ophiolite complex which is believed to represent a fragment of Cretaceous ocean crust and upper mantle generated at a constructive plate margin. The complex consists of mantle serpentinites, plutonic rocks ranging from dunite to trondhjemite, a sheeted dyke complex and pillow lava-sediment sequences, {{all of which have}} been chemically and petrographically analysed. Several belts of serpentinite occur within the ophiolite associated with major fault-lines. The serpentinites are clearly derived from depleted harzburgitic mantle and their field relations suggest that some were emplaced in the oceanic environment. The chemistry of the plutonic rocks suggests that they are products of dominantly open-system fractional crystallisation of tholeiitic liquid(s), possibly in several discrete magma chambers. Modelling of trace and RE elements suggests that moderate degrees of mantle peridotite melting were involved in production of the magma chamber parental liquid(s). At a higher crustal level sheeted dyke-massive gabbro relationships are interpreted in a model of roof underplating, which causes a decreasing frequency of dyke injection. Metamorphism of the sheeted dykes and lavas is interpreted as <b>sub-sea</b> <b>floor</b> in origin and its effect on whole-rock chemistry is assessed. The dykes and lavas have a chemistry largely typical of present-day ocean tholeiites and the relative contributions of the processes of partial melting and fractional crystallisation to that chemistry are evaluated. Two localised volcanic groups were identified, which appear to have enriched chemistries compatible with origin at off -axis oceanic islands. A major tectonic zone cross-cuts the ophiolite units and has features reminiscent of the modern oceanic transform faults. The importance of this structure, both in the oceanic environment and during the process of ophiolite emplacement, is assessed. Intrusive into the ophiolite is a granite whose trace and RE element chemistry is alien to the oceanic environment and suggests melting of continental crust Finally, a synthesized model of the former constructive margin is produced and an attempt is made to define the type of spreading centre represented. Comparison of the Masirah Ophiolite with the Semail Ophiolite of the Oman Mountains suggests that their former correlation may be ill founded. An assessment of late Mesozoic -early Tertiary plate motions indicates an origin during Cretaceous sea-floor spreading of an early Indian Ocean. Several features may indicate a slow-spreading, much-faulted, constructive margin. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{circulation}} of low temperature hydrothermal fluids through the oceanic crust has significant {{effects on the}} geochemical composition of the oceans and crust. Quantification of the magnitude and extent of these changes is essential for determining the crustal inputs to the mantle at subduction zones, the <b>sub-sea</b> <b>floor</b> microbial biomass, and the net changes in basement and seawater geochemistry. A highly heterogeneous upper crustal permeability structure, and variabilities in sediment thickness, lithology type, and spreading rate, means that fluid pathways {{and the extent of}} alteration are difficult to constrain. The effects of low temperature hydrothermal alteration in basement rocks are quantified at two hydrological end-member locations: a 0. 97 - 3. 59 Myr basement transect across the Juan de Fuca (JdF) Ridge Flank in the East Pacific Ocean, and at 8 Myr basement Hole 395 A, located at 23 N on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The influences of regional hydrology are demonstrated in observed variabilities in the character of alteration. Generally, the JdF basement rocks are characterised by orange, green, and grey alteration halos, and net geochemical changes associated with alteration occurring under oxidising conditions. Hole 395 A basalts are orange and grey, and net geochemical changes reflect a change from open to partially restricted circulation at 400 mbsf. At both sites, whole rock 87 Sr/ 86 Sr, Fe 3 +/FeTOT, and secondary mineral abundances show no trends of increasing alteration intensity with depth. The magnitude of alteration is similar in JdF and North Pond Holes (?- 10 %), implying that the oceanic crust is altered up to average values early; within the ?rst million years of formation. A global study of the oxidation extent of the oceanic crust supports these findings. The average Fe 3 +/FeTOT ratio for 3000 new and compiled analyses are weighted according to alteration type, and show that the oxidation extent is raised to an average of 34 % within the first 1 Myr of crustal formation, and does not increase as a function of crustal age. Additionally, results show that flow type has only minor influence on the oxidation extent of basalts. Downhole plots of Fe 3 +/FeTOT show that a sharp transition to lower oxidation ratios with depth is only evident in Hole 504 B. New data from Hole 1256 D show that elevated oxidation ratios are maintained to as deep as 1500 mbsf. A new estimate for the total oxidation extent of young and old ocean crust is 21 plus or minus 4 % to 23 plus or minus 4 %, respectively. An age representative calculation of the total net flux of ferric iron transported to the mantle at modern subduction zones is 1. 20 x 1013 molFe 3 +/yr...|$|E
40|$|Sediment Cores {{collected}} from the shallow <b>sub-sea</b> <b>floor</b> beneath the Ross Ice Shelf at Coulman High have been analysed using sedimentological techniques to constrain the retreat history of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) ice sheet in the Ross Embayment, and to determine when the modern-day calving line location of the Ross Ice Shelf was established. A characteristic vertical succession of facies was identified in these cores, that {{can be linked to}} ice sheet and ice shelf extent in the Ross Embayment. The base of this succession consists of unconsolidated, clast rich muddy diamicts, and is interpreted to be deposited subglacially or in a grounding line proximal environment on account of a distinct provenance in the clast content which can only be attributed to subglacial transport from the Byrd Glacier 400 km to the south of the drill site. This is overlain by a mud with abundant clasts, similar in character to a granulated facies that has been documented previously in the Ross Sea, and is interpreted as being a characteristic grounding line lift-o facies in a sub-ice shelf setting. These glacial proximal facies pass upward into a mud, which comprises three distinctive units. i) Muds with sub-mm scale laminae resulting from traction currents occurring near the grounding line in a sub-ice shelf environment overlain by, ii) muds with sub-mm scale laminae and elevated biogenic content (diatoms and foraminifera) and sand/gravel clasts, interpreted as being deposited in open water conditions, passing up into a iii) bioturbated mud, interpreted as being deposited in sub-ice shelf environment, proximal to the calving line. The uppermost facies consists of a 20 cm thick diatom ooze with abundant clasts and pervasive bioturbation, indicative of a condensed section deposited during periodically open marine conditions. During post-LGM retreat of the ice sheet margin in western Ross Sea, and prior to the first open marine conditions at Coulman High, it is hypothesized that the grounding and calving line were in relative close proximity to each other. As the calving line became "pinned" in the Ross Island region, the grounding line likely continued its retreat toward its present day location. New corrected radiocarbon ages on the foraminifera shells in the interval of laminated muds with clasts, provide some of the first inorganic ages from the Ross Sea, and strengthen inferences from previous studies, that the first open marine conditions in the vicinity of Ross Island were 7, 600 14 C yr BP. While retreat of the calving line south of its present day position is implied during this period of mid-Holocene warmth prior to its re-advance, at present {{it is not possible to}} constrain the magnitude of retreat or attribute this to climate change rather than normal calving dynamics...|$|E
