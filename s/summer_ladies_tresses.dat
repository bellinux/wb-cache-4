50|$|The genus Spiranthes {{contains}} about forty species, {{most of which}} are from North America. Some species are found in Central and South America, in temperate and tropical Asia southward to Australia and New Zealand. In Europe, three species occur in the wild. Besides the autumn <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses,</b> these are the <b>summer</b> <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> S. aestivalis, and the Irish <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> S. romanzoffiana, a mainly North American species that also occurs in Ireland and western Scotland. The autumn <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> is easily distinguished because the two other species of previously have inflorescences that occur earlier during the year (May-July) from a living rosette, with lanceolate leaves rising at an angle and having cream-colored instead of greenish or greyish white flowers. The autumn <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> also resembles the evergreen Goodyera repens (creeping lady's-tresses or dwarf rattlesnake plantain), which has a creeping rhizome rather than tubers. The inflorescence emerges from the centre of a rosette of ovate leaves with a pointed tip, and has striking perpendicular connective veins. The flowers are covered in long hairs that are often tipped with tiny droplets.|$|R
50|$|Spiranthes delitescens is a {{rare species}} of orchid known by the common names reclusive <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses,</b> Canelo Hills <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses,</b> and Madrean <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses.</b> It is native to Arizona in the United States, where there are only four occurrences. It is {{threatened}} by the loss and degradation of its habitat. It is a federally listed endangered species of the United States.|$|R

50|$|Spiranthes is a genus of orchids in the {{subfamily}} Orchidoideae. They {{are known}} commonly as <b>ladies</b> <b>tresses,</b> ladies'-tresses, or <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses.</b> The genus is {{distributed in the}} Americas, Eurasia, and Australia. The genus name Spiranthes {{is derived from the}} Greek speira ("coil") and anthos ("flower"), and was inspired by the spirally arranged inflorescence.|$|R

50|$|There are no {{naturally}} occurring coniferous {{forests in the}} Rhön, but notable species of wild flower such as the lady's slipper orchid, creeping <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> and burning-bush {{are found in the}} forests of mixed pine.|$|R
50|$|Navasota <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> {{was listed}} as an {{endangered}} species by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in May 1982. The decline of the plant is mostly due to loss of habitat from human encroachment and activity.|$|R
50|$|Spiranthes romanzoffiana, {{commonly}} known as Irish Lady's-tresses or hooded <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses,</b> is a species of orchid. Collected by Chamisso during the Romanzov expedition it was described by him in 1828 and named for Count Nikolay Rumyantsev who financed it.|$|R
50|$|Spiranthes parksii, the Navasota <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses,</b> is {{a species}} of orchid that is endemic to Texas, United States.

50|$|Pollination {{of autumn}} <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> is little observed. In the Netherlands the common carder bee Bombus pascuorum and red-tailed {{bumblebee}} Bombus lapidarius are regular visitors. In southern France (Rhône Department) the honeybee also pollinates. The silver Y Autographa gamma is also seen to visits the flowers, but attached pollinia {{have not been}} observed.|$|R
50|$|Spiranthes infernalis, {{common name}} Ash Meadows <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses,</b> {{is a rare}} species of orchid known from only four {{locations}} in Nevada, all close to one another. Type locale is inside Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge, in Nye County approximately 90 mi WNW of Las Vegas. The site is a seasonally wet meadow.|$|R
50|$|Autumn <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> may {{be found}} on quite {{different}} substrates, from weathered chalk and limestone to sand and gravel in dunes and slightly acidic heathlands. Occasionally, {{it has also been}} found on clay on sloping sites. It sometimes occurs in lawns, and was reported from the top of a wall in Sicily. Soils need to be low in nitrogen and phosphorus and neither dry nor wet.|$|R
50|$|The {{site is a}} flat {{bottomed}} valley {{with steep}} sides. The unimproved chalk grassland has several nationally rare plants, including moon carrot, spotted catsear, field fleawort, burnt tip orchid and pasque flower. There are also a variety of wild flowers such as the autumn <b>lady’s</b> <b>tresses,</b> which has been studied on the site for over fifty years. The ancient strip lynchet field system is of archaeological interest.|$|R
50|$|Spiranthes magnicamporum, {{commonly}} called the Great Plains <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses,</b> is {{a species of}} orchid that is native to North America. It is primarily native in the Great Plains, but there are outlying populations in the east in areas of former natural grassland, such as the Black Belt prairies of the Southeast. It is found in both fens and wet and dry prairies, often in calcareous soil.|$|R
50|$|The {{grassland}} {{is dominated}} by grasses such as upright brome, sheep's fescue, {{and there is little}} tor-grass. The latter makes the common different from others in the region. Herbs include rock-rose, common bird's-foot-trefoil, salad burnet and wild thyme. Orchids are in abundance including autumn <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses,</b> green-winged orchid and fragrant orchid, particularly in the quarry areas. There are scrub areas of hawthorn and there some trees such as ash.|$|R
50|$|In 52% of {{the plants}} the flowers are {{arranged}} counterclockwise, in 39% clockwise and in 9% {{of the plants}} the flowers are {{to one side of}} the inflorescence. The pollinators always land at bottom of the inflorescence and visit the flowers ever higher up. Most bumblebees have a strong preference for counterclockwise arrangement, fewer for clockwise. It seems that autumn <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> responds to this preference by offering different inflorescence types and thus increases the chances of fertilization.|$|R
5000|$|Vanda coerulea, {{commonly}} known as blue orchid, blue vanda or autumn <b>ladys</b> <b>tresses,</b> is a species of orchid found in Assam and neighbouring Khasi hills with its range extending to China (southern Yunnan). It is known as Kwaklei in Manipuri and Vandaar in Sanskrit. It has bluish purple flowers (Thelymitra crinita is the only orchid that has true blue flowers) which are very long lasting compared to other orchids. The plant bears up to 20 to 30 spikes ...|$|R
50|$|Navasota <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> is {{primarily}} {{found in the}} East Central Texas forests, usually along creeks in the Brazos and Navasota River watersheds. In 1982, when the species was listed as endangered, only two populations were believed to exist, both in Brazos County. Since then, biologists have identified the species in Bastrop, Burleson, Fayette, Freestone, Grimes, Jasper, Leon, Madison, Milam, Robertson, and Washington Counties. The population in Jasper County is disjunct {{and the only one}} that occurs in the Piney Woods.|$|R
50|$|Other federally and provincially listed {{endangered}} species are the small white lady's slipper (Cypripedium candidum), of which 34,491 stems were {{counted in the}} Preserve in 1998, and 16,899 of them were flowering stems. Others include the Great Plains <b>ladies</b> <b>tresses,</b> Culver's root, and Riddell's goldenrod. Some other prominent plants include sundrops, two-flowered cynthia, whorled loosestrife, whorled milkwort, and wild geranium which can all be found within the preserve, though they are not listed on provincial or federal species at risk lists.|$|R
5000|$|Spiranthes diluvialis is a {{rare species}} of orchid known by several common names, {{including}} Ute <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> (also, Ute ladies'-tresses). The species name diluvialis means [...] "of the flood". It is native to the western United States, where there are scattered, mostly small occurrences in the states of Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. An occurrence was recently discovered in southern British Columbia. The plant faces a number of threats to its existence. It is a federally listed threatened species of the United States.|$|R
50|$|Some of Scotland's {{flowering}} plant species have extremely restricted ranges in the country. These include Diapensia lapponica, found {{only on the}} slopes of Sgurr an Utha, Argyll and Mountain Bearberry, recorded at only a few mainland locations, and on Skye and Orkney. The pinewoods of Strathspey contain rare species such as Creeping <b>Lady's</b> <b>Tresses,</b> Twinflower and the One-flowered Wintergreen. Plans to protect the Intermediate Wintergreen, also found here, were introduced in 2008. Other nationally rare species include Tufted Saxifrage, Alpine Catchfly, Sword-leaved Helleborine, Norwegian Sandwort, Dark-red Helleborine, Iceland Purslane, Small Cow-wheat and Yellow Oxytropis.|$|R
5000|$|The Canelo Hills Cienega Reserve, is {{a nature}} {{preserve}} southeast of Sonoita, Arizona {{on the east}} side of the Canelo Hills. The area's 260 acres are a mix of rare cienega wetland and black oak and Arizona fescue fields. The preserve is notable for the extremely rare Canelo <b>ladies</b> <b>tresses</b> orchid (Spiranthes delitescens) [...] and the Gila chub and Gila sucker that grow along its alkaline banks. The ranch was purchased by the Nature Conservancy in 1969 from the Knipes family. It was designated a National Natural Landmark in December 1974.|$|R
50|$|Around {{the end of}} August a rosette {{of leaves}} appears, which winters and dies back in July at the latest. During the {{following}} weeks, a flower stalk emerges from {{the centre of the}} dead leaf rosette, and during flowering, one or two new rosettes are formed. Autumn <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> blossoms after the summer (August-October). The species is not self-pollinating. The pollination is done by bees and bumblebees. In nature, less than the half of the fruit capsules produce seeds. The very fine seeds are dispersed by the wind in October or November. Nevertheless, most seeds will not disperse more than a few dm from the mother plant since the vast majority of new plants are in close vicinity to an adult plant. Autumn <b>lady's</b> <b>tresses</b> spreads primarily through sexual reproduction. However, the plants to a limited extent also propagate vegetatively by the formation of side buds on the underground stem. The new plant forms its own tuber and leaf rosette, and if the old root dies, the connection between the two daughter plants is broken. The plants therefore often occur in small dense groups. An individual plant does not usually flower every year, apparently because the production of seeds takes a lot of effort. Plants do not necessarily appear above ground each year, so that after an absence mature plants suddenly seem to appear out of nowhere.|$|R
