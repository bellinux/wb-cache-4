5|$|A 2007 {{field study}} that used {{molecular}} techniques to survey aquatic fungal taxa {{in a small}} springbrook in Valley Spring, Southern Ontario, Canada discovered many fungal taxa with high genetic affinity to Limnoperdon incarnatum, which suggests that a closely related <b>species</b> <b>may</b> also be common in streams.|$|E

5|$|A solitary male {{purple-throated cotinga}} attracts a female by {{perching}} above the canopy {{and letting the}} sun highlight its iridescent plumage. The breeding behavior of this species is largely unknown, but the range in molting times implies that this <b>species</b> <b>may</b> breed year-round.|$|E
5|$|Areas where {{population}} {{data are}} limited and the <b>species</b> <b>may</b> be {{at higher risk}} include the Arabian Sea, the western North Pacific Ocean, {{the west coast of}} Africa and parts of Oceania.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{life on the}} {{shoreline}} includes yellow-crowned night herons, loggerhead shrikes, prairie warblers and shorebirds.

5|$|Cumulus clouds come in four {{distinct}} species, cumulis humilis, mediocris, congestus, and fractus. These <b>species</b> <b>may</b> {{be arranged}} into the variety, cumulus radiatus; {{and may be}} accompanied by up to seven supplementary features, cumulus pileus, velum, virga, praecipitatio, arcus, pannus, and tuba.|$|E
5|$|Fady can {{not only}} help protect lemurs and their forests under stable {{socioeconomic}} situations, {{but they can also}} lead to discrimination and persecution if a lemur is known to bring bad fortune, for instance, if it walks through town. In other ways, fady does not protect all lemurs equally. For example, although the hunting and eating of certain <b>species</b> <b>may</b> be taboo, other <b>species</b> <b>may</b> not share that same protection and are therefore targeted instead. Fady can vary from village to village within the same region. If people move to a new village or region, their fady may not apply to the lemur species that are locally present, making them available for consumption. Fady restrictions on lemur meat can be relaxed in times of famine and drought.|$|E
5|$|First {{collected}} in 1964, it was formally described in 2009. The <b>species</b> <b>may</b> be most {{closely related to}} O.concolor and O.mamorae, which are distributed further north and south in South America. Among other characters, the three share a particular arrangement of the arteries of the head. Virtually nothing is known of its biology.|$|E

5|$|In Africa, Crex <b>species</b> <b>may</b> be hunted by the leopard, serval, cats, the black-headed heron, dark {{chanting}} goshawk, African hawk-eagle, Wahlberg's eagle, {{and black}} sparrowhawk. In South Africa, newly hatched African crake chicks {{were taken by}} a boomslang.|$|E
5|$|Nine {{species of}} Perovskia are recognized. P.abrotanoides shares {{much of the}} range of P.atriplicifolia, but is {{distinguished}} by its bipinnate leaves. Hybrids between these two <b>species</b> <b>may</b> occur naturally. Restricted to Turkestan in its native range, P.scrophularifolia is less upright; some forms have white flowers. The flowers of P.scabiosifolia are yellow.|$|E
5|$|Other mating systems, {{including}} polygyny, polyandry, polygamy, polygynandry, and promiscuity, also occur. Polygamous breeding systems {{arise when}} females {{are able to}} raise broods {{without the help of}} males. Some <b>species</b> <b>may</b> use more than one system depending on the circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) are {{commonly}} cited {{as an example}} of a keystone species; because, they limit the density of sea urchins that feed on kelp. If sea otters are removed from the system, the urchins graze until the kelp beds disappear, and this has a dramatic effect on community structure. Hunting of sea otters, for example, is thought to have led indirectly to the extinction of the Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas). While the keystone species concept has been used extensively as a conservation tool, it has been criticized for being poorly defined from an operational stance. It is difficult to experimentally determine what <b>species</b> <b>may</b> hold a keystone role in each ecosystem. Furthermore, food web theory suggests that keystone <b>species</b> <b>may</b> not be common, so it is unclear how generally the keystone species model can be applied.|$|E
5|$|Some Myxogastria <b>species</b> <b>may</b> produce asexually. These are {{continuously}} diploid. There is no meiosis {{before the}} germination of the spores {{and the production}} of the plasmodium proceeds without germination of two cells.|$|E

5|$|The pygmy slow loris has a diploid {{chromosome}} number of 2n=50. Although the banding patterns on the chromosomes of all slow lorises are similar, this <b>species</b> <b>may</b> be distinguished from the Bengal slow loris (N.bengalensis) by distinct differences in the number and location of nucleolus organizer regions.|$|E
