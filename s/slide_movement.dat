5000|$|The {{next step}} up from the simple nut is a split nut, whose halves can be {{adjusted}} and locked with screws so that one side rides leftward thread faces, {{and the other side}} rides rightward faces. Notice the analogy here with the radio dial example using split gears, where the split halves are pushed in opposing directions. Unlike in the radio dial example, the spring tension idea is not useful here, because machine tools taking a cut put too much force against the screw. Any spring light enough to allow <b>slide</b> <b>movement</b> at all would allow cutter chatter at best and <b>slide</b> <b>movement</b> at worst. These screw-adjusted split-nut-on-an-Acme-leadscrew designs cannot eliminate all backlash on a machine slide unless they are adjusted so tight that the travel starts to bind. Therefore, this idea can't totally obviate the always-approach-from-the-same-direction concept; but backlash can be held to a small amount (1 or 2 thousandths of an inch), which is more convenient and in some non-precise work is enough to allow one to ignore the backlash (i.e., act as if there weren't any).|$|E

50|$|Dyneins are {{microtubule}} motors {{capable of}} a retrograde <b>sliding</b> <b>movement.</b> Dynein complexes are much larger and more complex than kinesin and myosin motors. Dyneins are composed {{of two or three}} heavy chains and a large and variable number of associated light chains. Dyneins drive intracellular transport toward the minus end of microtubules which lies in the microtubule organizing center near the nucleus. Dynein family has two major branches. One is axonemal dynein facilitates the beating of cilia and flagella by rapid and efficient <b>sliding</b> <b>movements</b> of microtubules. Another one is cytoplasmic dynein which facilitates transport of intracellular cargos. Compared to 15 types of axonemal dynein, only two cytoplasmic forms are known.|$|R

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{fluctuation}} in the translational <b>sliding</b> <b>movement</b> of microtubules driven by kinesin in a motility assay in vitro. By calculating the mean-square displacement {{deviation from the}} average {{as a function of}} time, we obtained motional diffusion coefficients for microtubules and analyzed the dependence of the coefficients on microtubule length. Our analyses suggest that 1) the motional diffusion coefficient consists of the sum of two terms, one that is proportional to the inverse of the microtubule length (as the longitudinal diffusion coefficient of a filament in Brownian movement is) and another that is independent of the length, and 2) the length-dependent term decreases with increasing kinesin concentration. This latter term almost vanishes within the length range we studied at high kinesin concentrations. From the length-dependence relationship, we evaluated the friction coefficient for sliding microtubules. This value is much larger than the solvent friction and thus consistent with protein friction. The length independence of the motional diffusion coefficient observed at sufficiently high kinesin concentrations indicates the presence of correlation in the <b>sliding</b> <b>movement</b> fluctuation. This places significant constraint on the possible mechanisms of the <b>sliding</b> <b>movement</b> generation by kinesin motors in vitro...|$|R

5000|$|Extending {{the slide}} from one {{position}} {{to the next}} lowers the pitch by one semitone. Thus, each note in the harmonic series can be lowered by an interval of up to a tritone. The lowest note of the standard instrument is therefore an E - a tritone below B. Most experienced trombonists can play lower [...] "falset" [...] notes and much lower pedal notes (first partials or fundamentals, which have a peculiar metallic rumbling sound). Slide positions are subject to adjustment, compensating for imperfections in the tuning of different harmonics. The fifth partial is rather flat on most trombones and usually requires a minute shortening of the slide position to compensate; other small adjustments are also normally required throughout the range. Trombonists make frequent use of alternate positions to minimize <b>slide</b> <b>movement</b> in rapid passages; for instance, B3 may be played in first or fifth position. Alternate positions are also needed to allow a player to produce a glissando to or from a higher note on the same partial.|$|E

40|$|After obtaining full-coverage swath {{bathymetry}} data in 1995 {{and very}} high-resolution acoustic profiles in 2002, four slides at the Balearic Margin of the Eivissa Channel {{in the western}} Mediterranean Sea were revisited in 2004 when side-scan sonar data were collected using a MAK- 1 M deep-towed acoustic system. These new findings, higher in resolution than those for the swath bathymetry, show two main features previously undetected within these submarine landslides: (1) a series of step-forming inclined and detached slabs oriented perpendicular to the <b>slide</b> <b>movement</b> and located in the uppermost part of the slides, and (2) arcuate regular positive ridges oriented also normal to the <b>slide</b> <b>movement</b> and located in the depositional lobes {{of some of the}} slides.

40|$|A {{significant}} interest {{exists in}} measuring the thermal emissivity of building surfaces since high values combined with high solar reflectance allow rejecting solar energy absorbed by irradiated surfaces, whereas intermediate or low values permit to limit condensation of humidity, heat {{loss to the}} sky, or heat transfer through airspaces. The most used measurement method is probably that described by the ASTM C 1371 Standard, which correlates the thermal emissivity to the radiative heat flux exchanged in the infrared between the sample surface, kept at ambient temperature, and the bottom surface of a hot emissometer head. With samples showing a low thermal conductivity, the 'slide method' modification is generally used: the hot head is allowed to slide above the sample {{in order to prevent}} this from warming up. The <b>slide</b> <b>movement,</b> however, is carried out by hand and time is needed to achieve a stabilized output, therefore the measurement may be time-consuming and also affected by the operator. In order to solve both problems, an automated approach is proposed here, in which the head is moved by the arm of a robot. This manages either the <b>slide</b> <b>movement</b> or the calibration with reference samples, interacting with a computerized data acquisition system that monitors the emissometer output...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{recently}} developed in vitro motility assay, we {{have demonstrated that}} local anesthetics directly inhibit myosin-based movement of single actin filaments in a reversible dose-dependent manner. This is the first reported account {{of the actions of}} local anesthetics on purified proteins at the molecular level. In this study, two tertiary amine local anesthetics, lidocaine and tetracaine, were used. The inhibitory action of the local anesthetics on actomyosin <b>sliding</b> <b>movement</b> was pH dependent; the anesthetics were more potent at higher pH values, and this reaction was accompanied by an increased proportion of the uncharged form of the anesthetics. QX- 314, a permanently charged derivative of lidocaine, had no effect on actomyosin <b>sliding</b> <b>movement.</b> These results indicate that the uncharged form of local anesthetics is predominantly responsible for the inhibition of actomyosin <b>sliding</b> <b>movement.</b> The local anesthetics inhibited <b>sliding</b> <b>movement</b> but hardly interfered with the binding of actin filaments to myosin on the surface or with actomyosin ATPase activity at low ionic strength. To characterize the actomyosin interaction in the presence of anesthetics, we measured the binding and breaking force of the actomyosin complex. The binding of actin filaments to myosin on the surface was not affected by lidocaine at low ionic strength. The breaking force, measured using optical tweezers, was approximately 1. 5 pN per micron of an actin filament, which was much smaller than in rigor and isometric force. The binding and breaking force greatly decreased with increasing ionic strength, indicating that the remaining interaction is ionic in nature. The result suggests that the binding and ATPase of actomyosin are governed predominantly by ionic interaction, which is hardly affected by anesthetics; whereas the force generation requires hydrophobic interaction, which plays {{a major part of the}} strong binding and is blocked by anesthetics, in addition to the ionic interaction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The Tjarnardalir {{landslide}} {{is located}} in the Almenningar area, in the outermost part of the Skagafjordur fjord, in central north Iceland. The landslide is a part of extensive sliding area on {{the eastern side of the}} fjord. The Tjarnardalir landslide originally fell as a rockslide from the western side of the Manarfjall Mountain. The front of the landslide reaches the present coast, forming up to 60 m high coastal cliffs that show clear indications of extensive coastal erosion. Geomorphological indications show that the landslide mass has a constant westward movement towards the sea, with mean rate up to 69, 2 cm/year. The strati-graphical record confirms that glaciomarine fine grained (silt/fine sand) sediments underlie the sliding material. Groundwater, which penetrates through the coarse landslide material, stops on the fine grained material and thus forms a sliding plain. It is assumed that the main part of the <b>sliding</b> <b>movement</b> takes place on this boundary. There is a clear correlation between the landslide movement and weather conditions. The main <b>sliding</b> <b>movement</b> occurs during the snowmelt period and during the autumn rain period. It is suspected that extensive costal erosion also plays a role in the <b>sliding</b> <b>movement,</b> but the erosion rate is not known. Electrical resistivity measurements indicate that the moisture content in the debris mass is high, which indicates extensive ground water flow...|$|R

40|$|The three {{dimensional}} {{surface movements}} of the retrogressive landslides at Beaver Creek were monitored from May, 1978 to August, 1979 using precise surveying techniques. A comprehensive, parametric, least squares adjustment computer program was developed {{to assist in the}} determination of the limit of accuracy, selection of the most desirable configuration and field procedure given the equipment available at the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. The computer program was also used in the subsequent· analysis of the field results, calculation of statistical accuracies and checking the reliability of the data. The study indicated that the rate of horizontal surface movement of the landslides increased from the scarp to the toe, with as much as 100 mm of surface movement occurring from May, 1978 to August, 1979. This observed movement agrees with the current retrogressive slide model. Vertical surface movement was as much as 30 mm downward in the same time period. Slide blocks near the scarp exhibited predominantly rotational movement whereas slide blocks near the toe exhibited predominantly translational movement. This observed behavior also agreed with the current retrogressive slide model. A seasonal trend in the rates of movement was also apparent suggesting a correlation between <b>slide</b> <b>movement</b> and environmental effects such as freeze-thaw, rainfall or river level. Surveying accuracies expressed in the form of 95 percent error elliptical cylinders were in the order of 7 mm horizontally and 2 mm vertically at distances of 150 metres.

Very common throughout the territory are also individual rotational (with 87 cases) and translational slides (48 cases). Blockages of river courses rarely occur by flows, falls or topples, because the volume of involved material is usually small and no visible traces of the landslide remain.

Moreover, (pre) programming duration was independent of direction uncertainty, supporting an independent order notion of programming of these response variables.
