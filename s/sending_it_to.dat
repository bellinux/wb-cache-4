5|$|Centaurs {{typically}} behave with {{characteristics of}} both asteroids and comets. Centaurs {{can be classified}} as comets such as 60558 Echeclus, and 166P/NEAT. 166P/NEAT was discovered while it exhibited a coma, and so is classified as a comet despite its orbit, and 60558 Echeclus was discovered without a coma but later became active, and was then classified as both a comet and an asteroid (174P/Echeclus). One plan for Cassini involved <b>sending</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a centaur, but NASA decided to destroy it instead.|$|E
5|$|Despite precautions, the {{post-production}} faced significant delays {{owing to}} the digital inter-mediation, increased work-load due to the 3-D and dubbed versions of the film, and delays in {{the completion of the}} visual effects. The post-production also faced budget constraints and witnessed an overuse of CGI according to the cinematographer. The delays left only two days for printing the film and <b>sending</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> theatres, generating significant anxiety over a possible delay in the release. Khan subsequently kept strict tabs on the progress of work, and postponed his knee surgery to complete the film on time.|$|E
5|$|The Netherlandish {{painters}} {{were largely}} {{forgotten in the}} 18th century. When Musée du Louvre was converted to an art gallery during the French Revolution, Gerard David's Marriage at Cana – then attributed to van Eyck – was the only piece of Netherlandish art on display there. More large panels {{were added to the}} collection after the French conquered the Low Countries. These works {{had a profound effect on}} German literary critic and philosopher Karl Schlegel, who after a visit in 1803 wrote an analysis of Netherlandish art, <b>sending</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Ludwig Tieck, who had the piece published in 1805.|$|E

5|$|The band {{managed to}} persuade fellow student Caleb Bradley to manage them, {{and by the}} start of 1968, the band had managed to record a demo tape {{influenced}} by blues and jazz, <b>sending</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Lou Reizner, then the U.K. head of Mercury Records, who offered the trio of Hammill, Smith, and Pearne a recording contract in May. At this point, the band {{had to make a decision}} whether to stay on at university, or quit their courses and move to London to turn professional. Pearne was not keen to abandon his studies, so decided to leave the group.|$|E
5|$|After the merger, {{the company}} began working on Enclave, a medieval fantasy, multiplayer-only video game {{inspired}} by Team Fortress. The game also became the company's first project with international appeal, enabling Starbreeze to partner with various publishers including Swing Entertainment, Conspiracy Entertainment, and Vivendi. However, Swing Entertainment faced bankruptcy at that time, and decided to turn the game into a single-player action-adventure video game {{with the goal of}} <b>sending</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> market as soon as possible. The game was released in 2002, and Starbreeze had to lay off staff after its release. Enclave II was also in development. The sequel was said to feature a more elaborate story, 28 different maps, 10 playable characters, and an improved fighting system. However, these features were axed when Starbreeze got into legal troubles with the publisher, resulting in the game's cancellation. Another game, , was successfully released with help from publisher TDK Mediactive. However its sequel was shifted to another developer. Starbreeze attempted to acquire another studio, Rock Solid Games, but the agreement between the two fell apart and brought both companies financial problems.|$|E
5|$|From the Japanese perspective, {{the battle}} was not going too well either. The Japanese had {{expected}} a landing on Seeadler Harbour, this being the logical American objective, and had concentrated their forces around the Lorengau airfield. The defence of the Momote airstrip and Hyane harbour was the responsibility of Baba Force, built around Captain Baba's 1stBattalion, 229th Infantry Regiment. Colonel Ezaki ordered Baba to attack the beachhead but a suspicion the Hyane Harbour landing was a diversion, coupled with false reports of enemy activity at Salami had him retain the 2nd (Iwakami) Battalion of the 1st Independent Infantry Regiment there instead of <b>sending</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> assist Baba Force. By 2March, Ezaki had resolved to attack the Hyane beachhead with his whole force. The difficulties imposed by the terrain, and disruption by American artillery and Allied naval gunfire, forced a postponement of the attack to the night of 3March.|$|E

In response to Donald Cameron’s criticism, Victorian Premier Graham Berry promised a 'searching enquiry' if sufficient evidence was provided.

25|$|Once {{the city}} of Buenos Aires was {{captured}} by the British, the local merchants offered him the public coffers {{in exchange for the}} boats, ships he had captured, and the private moneys Sobremonte had taken. They wrote the viceroy, asking him for the handing of the treasure he had taken, and guided the British to the cabildo at Luján. The invaders captured the treasure, <b>sending</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> London, where it was paraded in triumph {{on its way to the}} bank vaults (not knowing that a month earlier, the porteños had reconquered the city).|$|E
25|$|November 21, 2006 – Lebanon's Industry Minister Pierre Amine Gemayel {{was assassinated}} in his car by gunmen in Jdeideh, a Christian {{neighborhood}} {{on the outskirts of}} Beirut, bringing the Cabinet one seat closer to the nine empty seats that would force it to collapse. He was a young, outspoken opponent of Syria's occupation of Lebanon and its influence in the country. Analysts said Gemayel's death was likely to worsen tensions in the already divided country. Hours after the assassination, the Security Council approved the draft accord for the creation of the Hariri tribunal, <b>sending</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Lebanese government for final approval.|$|E

25|$|In the Senate, {{the bill}} faced {{numerous}} amendments {{made by the}} Republicans, which failed. Republicans struck two provisions dealing with Pell Grants from the bill due to violations of budget reconciliation rules, forcing the bill {{to return to the}} House. The two provisions were the fourth paragraph of Sec. 2101(a)(2)(C) and Sec. 2101(a)(2)(D). On March 25, the bill passed the Senate by a 56–43 vote, with all Republicans and three Democrats (Blanche Lincoln (D-AR), Ben Nelson (D-NE) and Mark Pryor (D-AR)) voting against it. Later that same day, the House passed the amended bill by a 220–207 vote, <b>sending</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> President Obama for a signature.|$|E

Gandalf reports that Sauron has corrupted Saruman, chief of the wizards. The Council decides that the Ring must be destroyed, but {{that can only be}} done by <b>sending</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Fire of Mount Doom in Mordor, where it was forged. Frodo takes this task upon himself. Elrond, with the advice of Gandalf, chooses companions for him. The Company of the Ring are nine in number: Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Gandalf, Gimli the Dwarf, Legolas the Elf, and the Man Boromir, son of the Ruling Steward Denethor of the land of Gondor.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} at Brussels of the Archduke Ernest of Austria, on 20 February 1595, the Archduke Albert {{was sent by}} Philip II of Spain (Spanish: Felipe II de España) to Brussels from the Spanish court in Madrid, to succeed his elder brother as Governor-General of the Spanish Netherlands, charge {{assigned}} to Don Pedro Henríquez de Acevedo, Count of Fuentes, until the arrival of Albert to the Low Countries. He made his entry in Brussels on February 11, 1596, and his first priority was the conflict with Henry IV of France.
