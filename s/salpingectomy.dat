30|$|The {{rest of the}} surgeries, 134 in total, were laparoscopies.

30|$|Laparoscopy {{revealed}} bilateral haemorrhagic masses with a {{small amount}} of blood in the pouch of Douglas. As the patient was already seeking fertility treatment for unexplained infertility and the option of IVF was available to the couple if IUI treatment failed, the decision was made to perform bilateral <b>salpingectomies</b> and thereafter plan further IVF treatment. Histology confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral ectopic pregnancies. She and her partner were then offered IVF to help attain pregnancy. A year later, she had a successful intrauterine pregnancy following IVF treatment.|$|R
30|$|On {{examination}} {{under general}} anaesthetic, vaginal access was limited {{due to the}} presence of the large fibroid. Its base appeared to be broad rather than pedunculated; therefore, a vaginal myomectomy was not attempted. Standard four-port laparoscopy was performed (video). It was not feasible to insert a uterine manipulator or a vaginal fornix delineator. Partial uterine inversion was diagnosed. The pelvic anatomy was distorted by the inward traction of the proximal part of the round and ovarian ligaments and fallopian tubes within the inverted uterine fundus. Bilateral <b>salpingectomies</b> were performed, and the ovaries were preserved. Bilateral ureterolysis was performed to identify the ureters which were seen drawn proximal to the uterus. Dissection of the ureters was continued down {{to the level of the}} uterine arteries which were clipped with Luger clips. Colpotomy was performed by digitally identifying the anterior vaginal vault above the invaginated fibroid. A total laparoscopic hysterectomy with bilateral <b>salpingectomies</b> and conservation of the ovaries was completed, and the specimen was extracted vaginally without the need for morcellation. The vaginal cuff was closed laparoscopically with four interrupted polyglactin absorbable sutures and extra-corporeal knots. The estimated blood loss was less than 50  ml. The operating time was 146  min. Recovery was uneventful, and histological examination proved a benign leiomyoma.|$|R

[...] The surgery depends upon the extent of nearby {{invasion of other tissues}} by the cancer when it is diagnosed. This extent of the cancer is described by assigning it a stage, the presumed type, and the grade of cancer. The gynecological surgeon may [...] remove one (unilateral oophorectomy) or both ovaries (bilateral oophorectomy). The Fallopian tubes (<b>salpingectomy),</b> uterus (hysterectomy), and the omentum (omentectomy) may also be removed. Typically, all of these organs are removed.|$|E

40|$|Ectopic {{pregnancy}} {{is a leading}} cause of maternal mortality. A high index of suspicion of an ectopic pregnancy must be borne in mind, especially when a woman of reproductive age presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain and a positive pregnancy test. An ectopic pregnancy can occur in unusual sites, particularly when assisted reproductive techniques have been used. Most ectopic pregnancies occur in the fallopian tube (so-called tubal pregnancies), but implantation can also occur in the uterine cornua, cervix, ovaries, and abdomen, including the retroperitoneum. We present only the second reported case of ovarian ectopic pregnancy in a 37 -year-old woman following an in vitro fertilisation and embryo transfer for bilateral <b>salpingectomies...</b>|$|R
30|$|We {{performed}} five (12 %) interventions at adnexal {{level with}} one cystectomy and one salpingo-oophorectomy for cyst and three <b>salpingectomies.</b> Pelvic inflammatory disease {{is found in}} 5 % of laparoscopy performed to CPP. One fourth of women who had acute salpingitis will develop CPP. The aftereffect of acute salpingitis can be variable and include adhesions, hydrosalpinx, and ovarian dystrophi [2]. Ovarian cysts are found in 3 % of laparoscopy performed for CPP. Ovarian cysts are usually asymptomatic or cause acute pain. Recurrent functional ovarian cysts seem to be sometimes the cause of CPP. In our series, adnexal surgeries have been associated to another procedure except in one case of the adnexectomy for a cyst. In all those cases, the patient is pain free (group A).|$|R
50|$|Patients {{were then}} {{interviewed by the}} Board and {{recommendations}} were made for sterilization. If they could not attend, members sometimes saw the patient in their institutional ward. Consent was initially required for all operational procedures, either from the patients, their parent or guardian. A competent surgeon {{was appointed to the}} case; however the Act stated they were not liable to any civil action. Various types of operations were performed: vasectomies, <b>salpingectomies</b> (tubal ligation), orchidectomies (removal of the testes), oophorectomies (removal of the ovaries), and sometimes hysterectomies. Operations took place in approved hospitals designated by the Board. In addition to the appointed board members and presenters, it was not uncommon for other professionals, support staff, or visitors to attend patient interviews.|$|R
50|$|A Nationwide {{study found}} {{statistically}} {{lower risk of}} ovarian cancer among women with previous <b>salpingectomy</b> {{when compared to the}} unexposed population. Bilateral <b>salpingectomy</b> is associated with a 50% decrease in ovarian cancer risk compared to unilateral <b>salpingectomy</b> (the removal of both or one fallopian tubes). Most protective effect was seen in women who had a bilateral <b>salpingectomy.</b> High-Grade Serous Carcinoma (HGSC) is usually driven by BRCA gene mutations - it was hypothesised that a decrease risk of ovarian cancer observed among women with <b>salpingectomy</b> reflects the effect of the removed tubal epithelium (fallopian tube).|$|E
50|$|BRCA1/2 {{mutation}} {{carriers are}} recommended <b>salpingectomy</b> at around {{the age of}} 40 to decrease their risk of ovarian cancer. <b>Salpingectomy</b> is most effective if performed before the natural menopause occurs, it was also found {{that there is no}} increased complication risks when <b>salpingectomy</b> is done {{at the same time as}} hysterectomy.|$|E
50|$|One {{study also}} {{confirmed}} after reviewing 21,000 procedures, {{that there was}} no increased risk in hysterectomy plus bilateral <b>salpingectomy</b> compared to hysterectomy alone. This may indicate that there are no surgical risks related to <b>salpingectomy</b> alone. They also found that prophylactic <b>salpingectomy</b> did not increase length of stay or the likelihood of readmission or blood transfusion. This is a reassuring and highly interesting result as both of these complications were voiced as surgical concerns at the time prophylactic <b>salpingectomy</b> was first proposed.|$|E
30|$|Results: Fifty six girls (age range 6  months to 19  years), 16 of them premenarchal, were surgically {{treated for}} 60 ovarian masses. Based on {{ultrasound}} assessment, 40 patients were booked for laparoscopy and 16 for laparotomy. In all, 40 patients with 44 adnexal masses had their operation completed laparosopically, including eight masses with tumor volume > 500  cm 3. On histological examination 47 masses were benign, including 19 torsions, and 13 were malignant, including one laparoscopic treated dermoid cyst with foci of immature teratoma. Laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy was successfully done in 42 of 44 adnexal masses, but with two <b>salpingectomies.</b> Laparoscopic adnexectomy, ovariectomy was performed each {{in a patient}} with adnexal torsion and sclerosing stromal tumor, respectively. The preoperative ultrasound assessment predicted the positive outcome of laparoscopic surgery with a sensitivity of 95 %, specificity of 100 %, PPV of 100 %. Preoperative ultrasound assessment also predicted the success of laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy with a specificity of 87 % and PPV of 95 %.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{retrospectively}} {{evaluates the}} preoperative work-up and the classification and operative treatment of acute abdomen caused by gynaecological disorders in emergency admissions to our department.

A total of 103 patients were identified (54 undergoing emergency operations, 9 operated on within 72 hours, and 40 managed conservatively with medical therapy. The 54 emergency operations performed were 24 ovarian resections, 17 <b>salpingectomies,</b> 5 oophorectomies, 4 exploratory laparotomies, 2 uterine polypectomies and 2 hysterectomies. The non-specific presentation of the disease and an inadequate preoperative work-up in these patients often led to a generic diagnosis at admission. This approach tends {{to increase the number of}} operations performed on an emergency basis, whereas a wait-and-see type of management should be adopted.

Holding media for the ova usually consist of blood serum, alone, or modified with a balanced saline solution. 	Diffusion chambers constructed of Millinore Filter membrane have proved valuable for 'in vivo' and 'in vitro' tissue culture and transnlantation.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo present {{our initial}} {{experiences}} in transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) for adnexal surgeries and hysterectomies. Materials and MethodsFrom September 2010 to December 2010, {{a total of}} 15 patients with benign adnexal or uterine diseases who were eligible for laparoscopic surgeries were recruited to undergo transvaginal NOTES at a tertiary referral medical center. Intraoperative and postoperative surgical outcomes were measured. ResultsTransvaginal NOTES was successfully completed in five adnexal surgeries and 10 hysterectomies without complications, an ancillary port on the abdomen, or conversion to conventional laparoscopy or laparotomy. For the 10 hysterectomies, the surgical time was 93. 4  ±  6. 3 minutes (mean ± standard deviation), intraoperative estimated blood loss 245  ±  54. 0  mL, uterine weight 440. 1  ±  76. 5  g, and the postoperative hospital stay 2. 7  ±  0. 3 days. No patients required intraoperative blood transfusion. The two tubal sterilizations were completed in 18 minutes and 30 minutes, respectively, with negligible blood loss. The two <b>salpingectomies,</b> including one ruptured ectopic pregnancy with 2000  mL hemoperitoneum, were completed in 62 minutes and 116 minutes, respectively. The enucleation was completed in 64 minutes with 20  mL estimated blood loss. ConclusionOur preliminary results indicate that transvaginal NOTES for adnexal surgeries and hysterectomies is feasible and safe.

40|$|Background: Laparoscopic {{surgery is}} a recent advance {{in the field of}} {{gynecological}} surgery. There are innumerable reports in literature on its advantages and disadvantages. However, problems faced by the surgical pathologist during grossing and histopathological reporting of these morcellated specimens have never been discussed before. We present our experience and the difficulties faced by a gynecologic pathologist (first author) and try to provide some clues for their solution. Materials and Methods: Sample size was 153 consecutive laparoscopic specimens, which varied from in toto uterus with cervix, fibroid or ovarian cyst to morcellated specimens. 153 non-laparoscopic gynecologic specimens constituted controls; 34. 0 &#x 0025; were ovarian cystectomies and remaining 66. 0 &#x 0025; were hysterectomies, myomectomies and <b>salpingectomies,</b> of which 36. 6 &#x 0025; were morcellated, rest were in toto. Result: Contents were not seen in majority of the ovarian cystectomies. Many more sections were taken in morcellated specimens, as compared to controls, for identification of endometrium, endocervix and ectocervix. Even then, in occasional cases identification was not possible. Congested bits in morcellated specimens interpreted as endometrium on grossing turned out to be parametrial tissue. Ectocervix could be identified as soft tissue bits covered by whitish membrane. Identification of transformation zone of the cervix was not possible in any of the morcellated hysterectomy specimens. Conclusion: The advantage of laparoscopic gynecological surgery to the patient need not prove to be so for surgical pathologist. The present study does not discourage gynecologists from performing laparoscopic surgeries but wishes to highlight the surgical pathologist&#x 2032;s problems and limitations...|$|R
40|$|The {{chromosome}} complements of ova from gilts {{selected for}} high ovulation rate (RS line, Ovulation rate = 15. 7) {{were compared to}} those from gilts from a control (C, Ovulation rate = 13. 4) line. From lymphocyte karyotypic analysis of these lines, {{it was estimated that}} the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in the pigs was less than 2. 7 %. Within each line, ova chromosome complements from untreated females (U) were compared to those from super-ovulated females (S, Ovulation rate increased 140 %). Bilateral <b>salpingectomies</b> were performed on 113 gilts post-ovulation. Removed oviducts were flushed to recover the ova which were then fixed on microscope slides by a new method (previously unpublished), examined, and classified as mature or immature, and then as chromosomally normal, abnormal, or nonanalyzable. With the new fixation method, 53. 3 % of the ova with chromosomes were analyzable. Analysis of the processing procedure revealed the extreme importance of minimizing the total time required for fixation of the ova, as well as the need to hold it constant across all treatments. ^ The median percentage of immature ova was greater in both RS line (12. 5 %) and S gilts (12. 8 %) than in the C line (4. 5 %) and U gilts (4. 5 %), respectively. Within the untreated animals, the median percentage of chromosomally abnormal ova (P-abnormal) was larger in RS (22. 2 %) than C line (14. 3 %) gilts, however {{there was no difference between}} lines in the superovulated pigs. Within the C line gilts, the median P-abnormal was greater in superovulated (25. 9 %) than untreated animals (14. 3 %), however superovulation did not increase P-abnormal in the RS line (U = 28. 0 %); (S = 22. 2 %). Of the abnormal ova, 94. 5 % were aneuploid. Ova immaturity and chromosomal abnormalities may explain 89. 7 % of the embryo mortality (EM) that was observed in the RS line (EM = 20. 4 %) prior to 30 days of gestation, compared to 42. 0 % of the loss in C line gilts (EM = 16. 9 %). Increasing ovulation rate in gilts by either genetic selection or superovulation appears to decrease the proportion of normal ova. ...|$|R
