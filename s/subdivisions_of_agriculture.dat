This study aims to test how the impact of capital per labor toward the output of fisheries from north of Jakarta. The study will try to measure how the impact of increasing in output toward the income of the labor in fisheries subdivision. The Solow analysis model is aplicated to the available data which are the number of capital and labor from fisheries subdivision. The result show that the growth of output is in decreasing return to scale. Lack of capital and abundant of labor make the negative growth of output. The output has a positive impact to the income, unfortunately only gives the low margin...|$|R
