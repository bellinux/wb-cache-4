25|$|Minor {{repairs to}} the convent {{were carried out}} in 1800; roof tiles were {{repaired}} {{at this time to}} protect the <b>sames</b> from weather. Ten years later, the convent spaces were occupied by quarters of the Guarda Real de Polícia (Police Royal Guard), including eventually, the garrisoning of the sharpshooter battalion (in 1814) and the militia (in 1831), following painting its interiors. In 1834, there were repairs by the Public Works department to adapt the convent to receive the Tribunal do Juízo de Direito do 3º Distrito (3rd District Judges' Law Court). The church was never fully rebuilt and rented out as sawmilling shop (in June 1835), before the religious orders were expulsed from the convent. At that time the first and second companies of infantrymen for the municipal guard were stationed at the convent and, later, the first cavalry squadron in 1845. It was donated in 1864 to the Association of Portuguese Archaeologists, which turned the ruined building into a museum.|$|E
500|$|Wally Snell once {{considered}} Boletus carolinensis {{to be the}} <b>sames</b> species as B.curtisii. He claimed that the former species was then considered distinct from the latter by virtue of an even, instead of [...] (netlike) stem, although they were otherwise quite similar in appearance and spore size and shape. Snell explained that although neither the English nor the Latin text of Berkeley's original description mentioned a reticulated stem, a later (1872) description by Berkeley characterized the stem as reticulato. Snell thought that {{this might have been}} an error in transcription, or an error in the species account, as herbarium specimens that he had examined lacked this feature. He changed his mind a couple of years later, when he found a small amount of reticulation in material collected by Peck.|$|E

2500|$|Many European {{folk and}} {{traditional}} repertories also feature quintuple meter. This {{is particularly true}} of Slavic cultural groups. The Bulgarian [...] "paidushko" [...] dance, for example, is in a fast 5, counted 2+ 3. In north-eastern Poland (especially in Kurpie, Masuria, and northern Podlaskie), five-beat bars are frequently found in wedding songs, with rather slow tempos and not accompanied by dancing. Traditional Russian wedding songs also are in quintuple time. The Poles and Russians share this proclivity for quintuple meter with the Finns, <b>Sames</b> (Lapps), Estonians, and Latvians. In Finland, the Kalevalaic [...] "runometric" [...] songs are the most distinctive feature of folk music, and the most common melody of these epic songs is in quintuple meter. This melody was described in the oldest study of runo singing in 1766, but first published in a musical transcription only about 20 years later. One South Slavic example is recorded in a manual published in 1714 by the Venetian dancing master Gregorio Lambranzi. It is a forlana titled [...] "Polesana", probably meaning [...] "From Pola", a city in Istria—today a part of Croatia but a Venetian possession until 1947. Although Lambranzi notated this dance in [...] time, its recurring phrase structure shows it to be in compound-quintuple time, so that its correct form is actually written in [...]|$|E
