5|$|Highly innervated, the glans {{exists at}} the tip of the {{clitoral}} body as a fibro-vascular cap, and is usually the size and shape of a pea, although it is sometimes much larger or smaller. While whether or not the glans is composed of erectile or non-erectile tissue is subject to debate (see above), it, or the entire clitoris, is estimated to have 8,000 or more <b>sensory</b> <b>nerve</b> endings.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{the human}} female's most sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. In humans and other mammals, it develops from an outgrowth in the embryo called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a penis or a clitoris, depending on {{the presence or absence}} of the protein tdf, which is codified by a single gene on the Y chromosome. The clitoris is a complex structure, and its size and sensitivity can vary. The glans (head) of the human clitoris is roughly the size and shape of a pea, and is estimated to have more than 8,000 <b>sensory</b> <b>nerve</b> endings.|$|E
25|$|Erythromelalgia is a {{difficult}} condition to diagnose as there are no specific tests available. However, reduced capillary density has been observed microscopically during flaring; and reduced capillary perfusion is noted in the patient. Another test {{that can be done}} is to have the patient elevate their legs, and note the reversal (from red to pale) in skin color. Tests done at universities include quantitative <b>sensory</b> <b>nerve</b> testing, laser evoked potentials, sweat testing and epidermal <b>sensory</b> <b>nerve</b> fiber density test (which is an objective test for small fiber sensory neuropathy). Due the aforementioned factors, patients may face delays in diagnosis.|$|E

40|$|The {{expression}} of nerve {{cell adhesion molecule}} L 1 in the neuronal growth cone of {{the central nervous system}} is strongly associated with the direction of growth of the axon, but its role in the regeneration of the peripheral nerve is still unknown. This study explored the problem in a femoral nerve section model in rats. L 1 and semaphorin 3 A mRNA and protein expressions were measured over the 4 -week recovery period. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that nerve cell adhesion molecule L 1 expression was higher in the <b>sensory</b> <b>nerves</b> than in motor nerves at 2 weeks after injury, but vice versa for the {{expression of}} semaphorin 3 A. Western blot assay results demonstrated that nerve cell adhesion molecule L 1 expression was higher in motor nerves than in the <b>sensory</b> <b>nerves</b> at the proximal end after injury, but its expression was greater in the <b>sensory</b> <b>nerves</b> at 2 weeks. Semaphorin 3 A expression was higher in the motor nerves than in the <b>sensory</b> <b>nerves</b> at 3 days and 1 week after injury. Nerve cell adhesion molecule L 1 and semaphorin 3 A expressions at the distal end were higher in the motor nerves than in the <b>sensory</b> <b>nerves</b> at 3 days, 1 and 2 weeks. Immunohistochemical staining results showed that nerve cell adhesion molecule L 1 expression at the proximal end was greater in the <b>sensory</b> <b>nerves</b> than in the motor nerves; semaphorin 3 A expression was higher in the motor nerves than in the <b>sensory</b> <b>nerves</b> at 2 weeks after injury. Taken together, these results indicated that nerve cell adhesion molecules L 1 and semaphorin 3 A exhibited different expression patterns at the proximal and distal ends of <b>sensory</b> and motor <b>nerves,</b> and play a coordinating role in neural chemotaxis regeneration...|$|R

25|$|Nociception (also nocioception or nociperception, from Latin nocere 'to harm or hurt') is {{the sensory}} nervous system's {{response}} to certain harmful or potentially harmful stimuli. In nociception, intense chemical (e.g., chili powder in the eyes), mechanical (e.g., cutting, crushing), or thermal (heat and cold) stimulation of <b>sensory</b> <b>nerve</b> cells called nociceptors produces {{a signal that}} travels along a chain of nerve fibers via the spinal cord to the brain. Nociception triggers a variety of physiological and behavioral responses and usually results in a subjective experience of pain in sentient beings.|$|E
25|$|Electrodiagnostic testing {{can help}} {{distinguish}} myopathies from neuropathies, {{which can help}} determine the course of further work-up. Most of the electrodiagnostic abnormalities seen in myopathies are also seen in neuropathies (nerve disorders). Electrodiagnostic abnormalities common to myopathies and neuropathies include; abnormal spontaneous activity (e.g., fibrillations, positive sharp waves, etc.) on needle EMG and, small amplitudes of the motor responses compound muscle action potential, or CMAP during nerve conduction studies. Many neuropathies, however, cause abnormalities of <b>sensory</b> <b>nerve</b> studies, whereas myopathies involve only the muscle, with normal sensory nerves. The most important factor distinguishing a myopathy from a neuropathy on needle EMG is the careful analysis of the motor unit action potential (MUAP) size, shape, and recruitment pattern.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Hypertension is a {{major risk}} factor leading to devastating {{cardiovascular}} events such as myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and renal failure. Despite intensive research in this area, mechanisms underlying essential hypertension remain to be defined. Accumulating evidence indicates that neural components including both sympathetic and <b>sensory</b> <b>nerves</b> innervating the cardiovascular and renal tissues {{play a key role}} in regulating water and sodium homeostasis and blood pressure, and that abnormalities in these nervous systems contribute to increased salt sensitivity and development of hypertension. In contrast to relatively well-defined sympathetic nervous system, the role of <b>sensory</b> <b>nerves</b> in the control of cardiovascular homeostasis is largely unknown. Data from our laboratory show that degeneration of capsaicinsensitive <b>sensory</b> <b>nerves</b> renders a rat salt sensitive in terms of blood pressure regulation. Evidence is also available indicating that <b>sensory</b> <b>nerves,</b> in interacting with other neurohormonal systems including the sympathetic nervous system, the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system, the endothelin system, and superoxide, regulate cardiovascular and renal function in such that they play a counter-balancing role in preventing salt-induced increases in blood pressure under pathophysiological conditions. Altered activity of the sensory nervous system, a condition existed in both genetic and experimental models of hypertension, contributes to the development of hypertension. This article focuses on reviewing the current knowledge regarding the possible role of <b>sensory</b> <b>nerves</b> in regulating blood pressure homeostasis as well as the function and regulation of novel molecules expressed in <b>sensory</b> <b>nerves.</b> Key Words: Capsaicin, vanilloid receptor, sympathetic nerve, angiotensin II, endothelin, oxidative stress, sodium, blood pressure...|$|R
500|$|Pain is {{generally}} an unpleasant feeling {{in response to}} an event that either damages or can potentially damage the body's tissues. There are four main steps in the process of feeling pain: [...] transduction, transmission, perception, and modulation. The nerve cells that detect pain have cell bodies located in the dorsal root ganglia and fibers that transmit these signals to the spinal cord. The process of pain sensation starts when the pain-causing event triggers the endings of appropriate <b>sensory</b> <b>nerve</b> cells. This type of cell converts the event into an electrical signal by transduction. Several different types of nerve fibers carry out the transmission of the electrical signal from the transducing cell to the posterior horn of spinal cord, from there to the brain stem, and then from the brain stem to the various parts of the brain such as the thalamus and the limbic system. In the brain, the pain signals are processed and given context in the process of pain perception. Through modulation, the brain can modify the sending of further nerve impulses by decreasing or increasing the release of neurotransmitters.|$|E

2500|$|Antihistamines can {{alleviate}} {{some of the}} milder {{symptoms of}} an allergic reaction, but do not treat all symptoms of anaphylaxis.

The Mayo Clinic stated, [...] "Orgasms vary in intensity, and women vary {{in the frequency of}} their orgasms and the amount of stimulation necessary to trigger an orgasm."
