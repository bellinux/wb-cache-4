40|$|Male {{insects that}} {{are unable to}} {{replenish}} sperm supplies between matings can suffer fitness costs either because their mates {{are more likely to}} accept subsequent suitors, or because their sperm are outnumbered when females do remate. We assessed the ability of fertile and sterile (irradiated) male Queensland fruit flies, Bactrocera tryoni ('Q-flies'), to have sperm stored by five <b>sequential</b> <b>mates</b> as well as the association between sperm depletion and female remating tendency. <b>Sequential</b> <b>mates</b> of fertile males stored similar numbers of sperm, indicating ample ability to replenish and maintain constant supplies between their once-daily mating opportunities. In contrast, <b>sequential</b> <b>mates</b> of sterile males stored progressively fewer sperm, with only trivial numbers of sperm stored by females mated by sterile males that had mated with two or more females previously. Despite the massive reduction in sperm storage by <b>sequential</b> <b>mates</b> of sterile males, fertile and sterile males were similar in their ability to induce sexual inhibition in their mates (to at least 30 days) and neither showed any decline in this ability across sequential matings. The ability of multiple-mated sterile males to induce sexual inhibition in their mates despite near or complete absence of sperm provides compelling evidence that sperm abundance plays no role in the induction of sexual inhibition in this species. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Most studies {{exploring}} {{the evolution of}} female mating systems focus on species in which females are either monandric (mate with a single male) or highly polyandric (mate with multiple males), but less is understood about variation in mating decisions within a species. How and why do females of a single species {{decide whether or not}} to copulate with additional mates? In this study we attempt to answer this question in the highly dimorphic crab spider, Mecaphesa celer, whose females may be either monandric or polyandric. We tested three hypotheses: (1) a female’s decision to remate is based on <b>sequential</b> <b>mate</b> choice; (2) a female’s decision to remate has fitness consequences, with polyandry providing increased benefits; and (3) mating order predicts male paternity, following a pattern of first-male sperm precedence. We conducted double-mating trials between females and males of varied sizes and age, quantified six putative fitness benefits obtained by monandric and polyandric females, and tested sperm precedence patterns using the sterile male technique. We found no evidence that female M. celer are performing <b>sequential</b> <b>mate</b> choice. Moreover, we found no difference in fitness between monandric and polyandric females. Finally, we found that paternity in polyandric females follows a pattern of sperm mixing. Mecaphesa celer females’ decisions regarding mating with multiple males do not appear to be influenced by comparisons of male attributes or by future fitness benefits. We recommend future studies examining male ejaculate components that might influence female mating decisions...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} periparturient disease accompanied by vulval discharge, and weaning-to-mating intervals, on sow fertility and litter size. Design Reproductive data were collected and analysed from 19 Hungarian swine herds over a 4 year period. Conception rates, farrowing rates and litter sizes of sows with periparturient disease accompanied by vulval discharge were used to {{evaluate the}} relationship between duration of vulval discharge and subsequent fertility and litter size. The possibility of interactions between weaning-to-mating intervals and duration of vulval discharges was investigated to determine if there was any effect on subsequent fertility and litter size. Results and conclusions Both parity 1 and parity 2 to 8 sows having had periparturient disease accompanied by vulval discharge in excess of 6 days duration had significantly (P < 0. 001) lower subsequent fertility (conception, farrowing and adjusted farrowing rates) compared with sows of similar parity where the duration of vulval discharge was < 4 or 4 to 6 days. There was no difference in fertility rates between sows, in both parity categories, with vulval discharge for < 4 days compared with 4 to 6 days. A duration of vulval discharge in excess of 6 days in parity 1 sows significantly reduced litter size (total born and live-born) in subsequent farrowings, but not in parity 2 to 8 sows. There was no interaction between the duration of vulval discharge and post-weaning to <b>mating</b> <b>intervals.</b> However sows with weaning to <b>mating</b> <b>intervals</b> between 7 and 10 days had smaller (P < 0. 001) subsequent litter sizes compared with 3 to 6 or 11 to 14 day intervals.

40|$|Female choice, {{identified}} as {{a major force in}} sexual selection theory, has recently been demonstrated in a number of species. These tests concentrated on simultaneous choice situations although females have to compare males sequentially in most territorial species, which is the more demanding task. Here it is shown that female three-spined sticklebacks, Gasterosteus aculeatus L., rate sequentially presented males according to their brightness. With increasing costs of sampling the females become less choosy. Furthermore, a male's attractiveness has a significant effect on the female's rating of the next male; a given male is rated higher when preceded by a duller male than by a brighter one and vice versa. Female sticklebacks use a stochastic decision rule in <b>sequential</b> <b>mate</b> choice that is attuned to the attractiveness of the present and previously encountered male. This demonstration of a "previous male effect" not only indicates an efficient mechanism for finding the best of a number of males but also extends the applicability of sexual selection theory...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{speciation}} {{hinges on}} understanding how reproductive barriers arise between incompletely isolated populations. Despite their {{crucial role in}} speciation, prezygotic barriers are relatively poorly understood and hard to predict.

In line with our predictions, this discrimination is asymmetric, with the more polyandrous G. bimaculatus mating heterospecifically and G. campestris females never mating heterospecifically.

40|$|The first-litter sow has lower {{lactation}} {{and subsequent}} reproductive performance than older parity animals. The experimental {{work in this}} thesis was conducted to elucidate the influence of dietary energy and protein concentration during lactation on the lactation and subsequent reproductive performance of first-litter sows, whose litters were weaned at 3 - 4 weeks of age. In the first experiment, 140 first-litter sows were offered one of five diets, ranging in lysine content from 6. 2 to 15. 1 g/kg. Voluntary feed intake and sow liveweight loss were unaffected by dietary lysine concentration. However sow backfat loss was lowest for sows offered the lowest lysine diet and tended to plateau at a dietary lysine level of 10. 6 g/kg. Piglet preweaning growth responded in a curvilinear manner to increasing lysine concentration. The results also indicated for sows nursing 9 or more piglets, that weaning to <b>mating</b> <b>interval</b> decreased with increasing sow dietary lysine concentration. Subsequent litter size was significantly higher for sows offered the two higher lysine diets during lactation, compared to the two lower lysine diets (10. 7 vs 9. 6 born alive, P<. 05; s. e. d. 0. 5). In the second experiment, 175 first-litter sows were offered one of five diets with a similar lysine:digestible energy (DE) ratio (0. 88 to 0. 85 g/MJ) but ranging in DE content from 12. 6 to 15. 1 MJ/kg. Voluntary food intake and piglet growth rate during lactation were unaffected by DE content of the diets. Sow liveweight loss during lactation declined with increasing energy content up to 13. 8 MJ DE/kg. Backfat loss during lactation tended to be highest for sows offered the diet of lowest DE content and declined with increasing energy content up to 15. 1 MJ DE/kg. The subsequent weaning to remating interval and litter size were unaffected by dietary DE content. In the third experiment, 204 first-litter sows were offered diets containing either 8. 1 or 13. 3 g lysine/kg during lactation. Voluntary food intake in lactation, piglet preweaning growth, sow liveweight and backfat loss during lactation, weaning to <b>mating</b> <b>interval</b> and subsequent litter size, were unaffected by dietary lysine concentration of the lactation diet. The number of corpora lutea and embryos were also not influenced by dietary lysine concentration during the preceding lactation. However, the data from those sows whose preweaning litter growth was in excess of 40 kg demonstrated a significant improvement in number of corpora lutea at the higher dietary lysine level. The results indicate that sow liveweight and fat losses during lactation {{appear to be more}} responsive to changes in DE concentration than changes in dietary lysine level. However, lysine concentration may limit piglet growth rate, weaning to <b>mating</b> <b>interval</b> and subsequent litter size. The results also suggest that improvements in subsequent litter size, observed when sows are offered high dietary lysine levels during lactation, may be due to an improvement in ovulation rate. These experiments suggest that current amino acid recommendations for lactating first-litter sows are inappropriate and may be constraining both milk production and subsequent reproductive performance.

40|$|Pkdrej, {{a member}} of the polycystin- 1 gene family, is {{expressed}} only in the male germ line. Male mice that are homozygous for a targeted mutation in the Pkdrej allele (Pkdrej(tm/tm)) are fertile in unrestricted mating trials, but exhibit lower reproductive success when competing with wild-type males in <b>sequential</b> <b>mating</b> trials and in artificial insemination of mixed-sperm populations. Following mating, sperm from Pkdrej(tm/tm) mice require 3 ̆e 2 h longer than those of wild-type males to be detected within the egg/cumulus complex in the oviduct. Sperm from mice of both genotypes are able to capacitate in vitro. However, one of the component processes of capacitation, the ability to undergo a zona pellucida-evoked acrosome reaction, develops more slowly in sperm from Pkdrej(tm/tm) animals than in sperm from wild-type males. In contrast, a second component process of capacitation, the transition to hyperactivated flagellar motility, develops with a similar time course in both genotypes. These two behavioral consequences of capacitation, exocytotic competence and altered motility, are therefore differentially regulated. These data suggest that Pkdrej controls the timing of fertilization in vivo through effects on sperm transport and exocytotic competence and is a factor in postcopulatory sexual selection...|$|R

We investigated <b>sequential</b> <b>mate</b> choice for same or novel mating partners in females of the cellar spider Pholcus phalangioides (Pholcidae) {{to understand what}} drives female remating in this system. Pholcus phalan- gioides females are moderately polyandrous and show reluctance to remating, but double-mated females benefit from a higher oviposition probability compared to single-mated females. We exposed mated females to either their former (same male) or a novel mating partner and assessed mating success together with courtship and copulatory behaviours in both sexes. We found clear evidence for mate discrimination: females experienced three fold higher remating probabilities with novel males, being more often aggressive towards former males and accepting novel males faster in the second than in the first mating trial. The preference for novel males suggests that remating is driven by benefits derived from multiple partners. The low remating rates and the strong last male sperm precedence in this system suggest that mating with novel partners that represent alternative genotypes may be a means for selecting against a former mate of lower quality...|$|R
40|$|In the Japanese pygmy squid Idiosepius paradoxus, females often {{pick up the}} spermatangium {{using their}} mouth (buccal mass) after copulation. To examine whether the female I. paradoxus {{directly}} transfers sperm into the seminal receptacle via this picking behaviour, or removes the spermatangium, we conducted detailed observations of picking behaviour in both virgin and copulated females and compared the sperm storage conditions in the seminal receptacle between females with and without spermatangia picking after copulation in virgin females. In all observations, elongation of the buccal mass occurred within 5 min after copulation. However, sperm volume in the seminal receptacle {{was not related to}} spermatangia picking. Observations using slow-motion video revealed that females removed the spermatangia by blowing or eating after picking. These results suggest that picking behaviour is used for sperm removal but not for sperm transfer. Moreover, the frequency of buccal mass elongation was higher in copulated females than in virgin females, consistent with the <b>sequential</b> <b>mate</b> choice theory whereby virgin females secure sperm for fertilisation, while previously copulated females are more selective about their mate.

We {{examined the effects}} of the body sizes of females and their mates on attributes of female first mating, and the effects of body sizes of females and their previous and potential future mates on female remating in the adzuki bean beetle, Callosobruchus chinensis. Large- and small-sized adults were derived from larvae reared under conditions of low and high density in a bean, respectively. The speed of first mating of large females was not affected by the size of courting males, whereas small females initiated mating more rapidly when courted by small males. The remating probability of large females was not affected by first male size, whereas small females that mated first with smaller males were more likely to remate. These data suggest that pre- and post-copulatory female choices for male size depend on the female 2 ̆ 7 s size, and the small females might be more willing to copulate with smaller males but prefer larger males to sire their offspring after copulation. A possible explanation for this preference is that small females may suffer greater harm from copulating with larger males...|$|R

Parametric design optimization of the minus devices via a genetic algorithm maximizing the yield of a desired assembly, and rate equation analyzes of the resulting designs, reveal that the minus devices facilitate the robust yield of a desired assembly against the variation in the initial fraction of the part types, by specifying a fixed assembly sequence during the self-assembling process. It is also found that while the minus devices can “encode ” some assembly sequences, encoding other assembly sequences {{requires the use of}} another type of conformational switches, plus devices. To investigate the “encoding power ” of these conformational switches, a formal model of selfassembling systems, one-dimensional self-assembling automaton, is introduced, where assembly instructions are written as local rules that specify conformational changes realized by the conformational switches.

40|$|BACKGROUND Many of the {{reproductive}} decisions that humans make happen without much planning or forethought, arising instead {{through the use}} of simple choice rules or heuristics that involve relatively little information and processing. Nonetheless, these heuristic-guided decisions are typically beneficial, owing to humans' ecological rationality - the evolved fit between our constrained decision mechanisms and the adaptive problems we face. OBJECTIVE This paper reviews research on the ecological rationality of human decision making in the domain of reproduction, showing how fertility-related decisions are commonly made using various simple heuristics matched to the structure of the environment in which they are applied, rather than being made with information-hungry mechanisms based on optimization or rational economic choice. METHODS First, heuristics for <b>sequential</b> <b>mate</b> search are covered; these heuristics determine when to stop the process of mate search by deciding that a good-enough mate who is also mutually interested has been found, using a process of aspiration-level setting and assessing. These models are tested via computer simulation and comparison to demographic age-at-first-marriage data. Next, a heuristic process of feature-based mate comparison and choice is discussed, in which mate choices are determined by a simple process of feature-matching with relaxing standards over time. Parental investment heuristics used to divide resources among offspring are summarized. Finally, methods for testing the use of such mate choice heuristics in a specific population over time are then described...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{selection}} pressures shaping components of male reproductive success {{is essential for}} assessing the role of sexual selection on phenotypic evolution. A male's competitive reproductive success is often measured in <b>sequential</b> <b>mating</b> tests by recording P 1 (first mating male) and P 2 (second mating male) paternity scores. How each of these scores relates to a male's overall fitness, for example, lifetime reproductive success is, however, not known. This information {{is needed to determine}} whether males benefit from maximizing both P 1 and P 2 or by trading off P 1 against P 2 ability. We measured P 1, P 2, and an index of lifetime reproductive success (LRSi, a male's competitive reproductive success measured over 12 days) for individual male Drosophila melanogaster. We found no evidence for phenotypic correlations between P 1 and P 2. In addition, whereas both P 1 and P 2 were associated with relative LRSi, only P 2 predicted absolute LRSi. The results suggest that P 2 was most closely linked to LRSi in the wild-type population studied, a finding which may be common to species with strong second male sperm precedence. The study illustrates how P 1 and P 2 can have differing relationships with a male's overall reproductive success, and highlights the importance of understanding commonly used measures of sperm competition in the currency of fitness...|$|R

40|$|Avoidance of incestuous matings {{is widely}} {{reported}} across many animal taxa, and the adaptive {{value of such}} behavior is explained through inbreeding depression. However, an old and somewhat neglected theoretical result predicts that inbred matings offer another, {{positive effect on the}} inclusive fitness of parents: an individual who mates with a relative will help that relative to spread genes identical by descent. This benefit can be substantial, if the additional mating achieved by the relative does not harm his mating success otherwise, and in the context of selfing in plants the phenomenon is well known. Here, we develop a model that derives expected values of inbreeding tolerance, that is, the magnitude of inbreeding depression that is required to make individuals avoid inbreeding, for different animal life histories and parental investment patterns. We also distinguish between simultaneous and <b>sequential</b> <b>mate</b> choice, and show that inbreeding tolerance should often be remarkably high in the latter scenario in particular, although egalitarian parental care will lead to lower tolerance. There is a mismatch between theory and data: the almost complete lack of cases where individuals prefer to mate incestuously is at odds with a large overlap between the predicted range of inbreeding tolerance and estimates of inbreeding depression found in nature. We discuss four different solutions to this enigma, and suggest that inbreeding tolerance, where it is found, should not always be attributed to a simple constraint that has prevented finding any other mate...|$|R

40|$|Sexual cannibalism, where {{a female}} kills and consumes a courting male, {{represents}} an extreme form of sexual conflict {{and has been}} proposed as a mechanism of mate choice. We evaluate the evidence for mate choice through premating sexual cannibalism via mate rejection, other indirect mechanisms of mate ‘choice’ and choice in postmating sexual cannibalism. We highlight a paucity of investigations, particularly of field studies, and note gaps in our knowledge. There is empirical support for the size-dependent sexual cannibalism predicted by mate choice through premating sexual cannibalism. This may represent mate choice operating on absolute male size {{but it could be}} a by-product of female foraging behaviour and greater vulnerability of relatively smaller males. Thus, indirect mate choice is as plausible an explanation of size-dependent sexual cannibalism as is direct mate choice based on discrimination of male traits. Direct female choice, mediated through premating sexual cannibalism, has yet to be demonstrated. We suggest a framework for distinguishing direct and indirect choice and note an absence of information on which to test it. There is evidence for <b>sequential</b> <b>mate</b> choice in postmating sexual cannibalism, but the nature or basis of the female's discriminatory behaviour remains unclear.

40|$|One hundred twenty {{multiparous}} does were used. The does were synchronized to have parturition {{the same}} day (initial kindling). The trial lasted until the successive (final) kindling.

The remaining does were assigned to three reproductive rhythms, being mated 2 days postpartum (R 2), 11 d pp (R 11) or 26 d pp (R 26). Within each rhythm, the does were further divided into two groups, whose litters were weaned at 21 (S 21) or 25 (S 25) d of age. A total of fifty-four does were pregnant and were slaughtered soon after the final kindling. Effect of reproductive rhythm. When increasing the kindling to <b>mating</b> <b>interval,</b> total milk production increased (5590 to 6065 g for R 2 and R 26 rhythms; P= 0. 05). Voluntary feed intake was not affected during lactation (364 g/d on average), but decreased during the dry period (182 to 169 g/d; P= 0. 05) and throughout the entire experiment (299 to 249 g/d; P< 0. 01) according to reproductive rhythm. At the final kindling, the number of kits born per litter was lower in does submitted to R 11 rhythm (P< 0. 01). When increasing the kindling to <b>mating</b> <b>interval,</b> doe body water concentration decreased, while fat and energy increased (P< 0. 001) and a higher EB gain was recorded (from - 123 to - 4 to 97 g, P< 0. 001).

Blood leptin concentration at 28 d after kindling was higher in R 26 does (P< 0. 01), indicating higher body fat recovery {{due to lack of}} pregnancy. Effect of weaning age. Daily feed intake during the entire experiment was significantly lower in W 21 does due to the longer dry period. At the final kindling, increasing weaning age from 21 to 25 d, both the number of kits born alive per litter (from 7. 3 to 9. 8; P= 0. 02) and doe body water concentration increased, while body fat and energy decreased (P< 0. 05).

40|$|In most animal species, {{particularly}} those in which females engage in polyandry, mate choice is a sequential process in which a female must choose to mate or not to mate with each male encountered. Although a number of theoretical and empirical investigations have {{examined the effects of}} <b>sequential</b> <b>mate</b> choice on the operation of sexual selection, how females respond to solicitation by previous mates has received little attention. Here, we report the results of a study carried out on the polyandrous pseudoscorpion, Cordylochernes scorpioides, that assessed the sexual receptivity of once-mated females presented after a lapse of 1. 5 hr or 48 hr with either their first mate or a different male. Females exhibited a high level of receptivity to new males, irrespective of intermating interval. By contrast, time between matings exerted a strong effect on female receptivity to previous mates. After a lapse of 48 hr, females did not differ significantly in their receptivity toward previous mates and different males, whereas at 1. 5 hr after first mating, females were almost invariably unreceptive to males from whom they had previously accepted sperm. This result could not be attributed to male size or mating experience or to male sexual receptivity. Indeed, males were as willing to transfer sperm to a previous mate as they were to a new female. This difference between males and females in their propensity to remate with the same individual may reflect a conflict between the sexes, with males seeking to minimize postcopulatory sexual selection and females actively keeping open the opportunity for sperm competition and female choice of sperm by discriminating against previous mates...|$|R
40|$|When a male mouse is {{presented}} with two H- 2 congenic two female in estrus, {{his choice of}} a mate is influenced by their H- 2 types.

Statistical analysis showed trends in the data that support the following conclusions: (a) The choice is made by the male, not the female.

(c) Consistency of choice does not always correspond with strain preference. In one of six comparisons of H- 2 genotypes there was no strain preference but pronounced consistency of choice by individual two male. This suggests memory, but fortuitous bias is not excluded.

These findings conform to a provisional model in which olfactory mating preference is governed by two linked genes in the region of H- 2, one for the female signal and one for the male receptor. These mating preferences could in natural populations serve the purpose of increasing the representation of particular H- 2 haplotypes or of maintaining heterozygosity of genes in the region of H- 2...|$|R

40|$|The {{compound}} ascidian Diplosoma listerianum releases aquatic sperm {{which are}} dispersed passively to potential mates as individual gametes prior to storage of sperm, internal fertilization and brooding of embryos. The storage of exogenous sperm enables D. listerianum {{to produce a}} lengthy series of progeny following {{a brief period of}} mating. Molecular paternity analysis following <b>sequential</b> <b>mating</b> of colonies in laboratory culture revealed a consistent pattern with a clear initial bias in paternity towards the first of two acting males. The sites of sperm storage and fertilization and the morphology of the ovary in D. listerianum suggest that this bias reflects first-in-first-out use of individual stored gametes. The proportion of second-male paternity subsequently increased with time within the progeny arrays. This may have reflected the ageing or passive loss of first-male sperm. It is also possible that the modular nature of the organism contributed to this temporal trend: any recently budded colony modules maturing in the interval between matings would have been available exclusively to second-male sperm as virgin zooids. Two sets of mating trials were run. In the first, the collection of progeny suffered an interruption of 13 days and each male gained a larger proportion of recorded paternity within the progeny analysed when mating first rather than when mating second. In one mating combination, the first male obtained almost 100 % of recorded paternity. In the second set of trials, with different clonal combinations, the complete sequence of progeny was collected and the estimated overall proportion of second-male paternity (P 2) was consistently > 0. 5. Taken as a whole, the results suggest that the overall P 2 -value can vary widely within the population studied. Proposed mechanisms of mating-order effects in species with copulatory mating include several which can have no counterpart in indirect aquatic mating since they involve the active removal, sealing off, volumetric displacement or incapacitation of first-male ejaculates. It is nevertheless clear that mating-order effects can be pronounced during the type of non-copulatory mating examined here, which is widespread in marine invertebrates...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to delineate the duration of postpartum estrus in the prairie vole, Microtus ochrogaster. Breeding pairs were separated prior to parturition, and males were reintroduced to the females 0 - 12 h, 12 - 24 h, 24 - 48 h, or 48 - 72 h postpartum. Pairs were observed for 1 h to determine whether mating occurred. Eighty percent of females in the first two time intervals were receptive within 24 h of parturition, 60 % of females in the third time <b>interval</b> <b>mated</b> with males 24 - 48 h postpartum, and only 10 % of females in the final time <b>interval</b> <b>mated</b> 48 - 72 h following parturition. These results indicate that postpartum estrus in this species typically lasts only 24 - 48 h. A postpartum estrus is apparently characteristic of microtine rodents, but the duration has not been determined for many species (Hasler, 1975).

40|$|Male {{eagerness to}} mate {{is a central}} {{paradigm}} of sexual selection theory. However, limited sperm supplies mean that male sexual restraint might sometimes be favored under promiscuous mating. Here, we demonstrate dynamic plasticity in male mating effort when females are encountered sequentially under varying sperm competition risk. Rather than showing consistent eagerness to mate, male house mice (Mus musculus domesticus) instead tailor their mating effort according to likely reproductive payoffs. They are {{significantly less likely to}} mate when sperm competition is certain and potential reproductive payoffs low, but dramatically increase investment if they do choose to mate under such circumstances. By contrast, male mice are significantly more likely to mate in situations simulating extra-territorial copulations, where future risk of competition is high but so too are potential reproductive rewards. Differential mating propensity appears to be the primary mechanism by which male house mice allocate sperm adaptively under sperm competition risk because we find no evidence for facultative adjustment of sperm numbers per ejaculate or ejaculation frequency in response to female-related cues. We conclude that <b>sequential</b> male <b>mate</b> choice under sperm competition risk could be a widespread but often unappreciated mechanism of strategic sperm allocation. ...|$|R
