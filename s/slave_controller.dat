50|$|Short {{cycle times}} can be {{achieved}} since the host microprocessors in the slave devices {{are not involved in}} the processing of the Ethernet packets to transfer the process images. All process data communication is handled in the <b>slave</b> <b>controller</b> hardware. Combined with the functional principle this makes EtherCAT a high performance distributed I/O system: Process data exchange with 1000 distributed digital I/O takes about 30 µs, which is typical for a transfer of 125 byte over 100Mbit/s Ethernet. Data for and from 100 servo axis can be updated with up to 10 kHz.

40|$|There are two {{significant}} goals in teleoperation systems: Stability and performance. This paper introduces an LMI-based robust control method for bilateral transparent teleoperation systems in presence of model mismatch. The uncertainties in time delay in communication channel, task environment and model parameters of master-slave systems are called a model mismatch. The time delay in communication channel {{is assumed to}} be large, unknown and asymmetric, but the upper bound of the delay {{is assumed to be}} known. The proposed method consists of two local controllers. One local controller namely local <b>slave</b> <b>controller</b> is located on the remote site to control the motion tracking and the other one is located on the local site namely local master controller to preserve the complete transparency by ensuring force tracking and the robust stability of the closed-loop system. To reduce the peak amplitude of output signal respect to the peak amplitude of input signal in slave site, the local <b>slave</b> <b>controller</b> is designed based on a bounded peak-to-peak gain controller.

Software-defined {{networks}} (SDNs) have been recognized as the next-generation networking paradigm that decouples the data forwarding from the centralized control. To realize the merits of dedicated QoS provisioning and fast route (re) configuration services over the decoupled SDNs, various QoS requirements in packet delay, loss, and throughput should be supported by an efficient transportation with respect to each specific application. In this paper, a QoS-aware adaptive routing (QAR) is proposed in the designed multi-layer hierarchical SDNs. Specifically, the distributed hierarchical control plane architecture is employed to minimize signaling delay in large SDNs via three-levels design of controllers, i. e., the super, domain (or master), and <b>slave</b> <b>controllers.</b> Furthermore, QAR algorithm is proposed {{with the aid of}} reinforcement learning and QoS-aware reward function, achieving a time-efficient, adaptive, QoS-provisioning packet forwarding.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to a robust fuzzy controller design for the bilateral teleportation system with varying time delays using linear matrix inequalities. Communication channels are considered with different forwarding and returning time delays. The time delays of communication channels are assumed to be unknown and randomly time varying, but the upper bounds of the delay interval and the derivative of the delay are assumed to be known. In order to design the controllers, first, an impedance controller is designed for the master system to achieve desired impedance behavior for the master. Then, nonlinear Euler-Lagrange equation of motion of the slave system is linearized in the neighborhood of some operating points. In the sequel, an open-loop scheme is considered for the slave system. The linear model of the slave system has two imaginary/unstable poles. The slave system is stabilized by a PD-controller {{to be used in the}} open-loop scheme. To design the <b>slave</b> <b>controller,</b> the tele-operator block diagram is rearranged such that the tele-operator block diagram converts to a standard representation of a feedback control system which helps us to design a robust H-infinity controller for the slave system. The local linear models of the system are combined to form a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model of the whole tele-operation system. A Lyapunov-Krasovskii function is defined to analyze the closed-loop system’s stability and derive a sufficient delay-dependent stability criterion. An H-infinity performance index is defined and the design criteria for the <b>slave</b> <b>controller</b> are expressed as a set of LMIs, which can be tested readily using standard numerical software...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes the {{application}} of an improved extended active observer (IEAOB) based teleoperation controller for both master and slave manipulators. The proposed approach successfully deals with all the major problems in teleoperation systems associated with force/position tracking, external force estimation, communication delay compensation, and suppression of disturbances such as robot inertial parameter variation, unmodeled dynamics, measurement noise, and frictions in joints. As an enhancement of the extended active observer (EAOB) reported earlier, the proposed IEAOB relies on an accurate model of system rigid-body dynamics and measured motion to estimate external torque and friction torque, which are both subsequently used {{in the design of}} master and <b>slave</b> <b>controllers.</b> Stability of the entire teleoperation system is verified through stability analysis. In order to demonstrate effectiveness of the approach, the IEAOB-based teleoperation controller is applied to a pair of 3 -DOF Phantom haptic devices connected via a communication channel with time-varying delays.
