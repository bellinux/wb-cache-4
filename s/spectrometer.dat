Possible instruments include Medium Resolution Camera, Flux Gate Magnetometer, Visible/NIR Imaging <b>Spectrometer,</b> Laser Altimeter, Low and High Energy Plasma Packages, Ion and Neutral Mass <b>Spectrometer,</b> UV Imaging <b>Spectrometer,</b> Radio and Plasma Wave sensor, Narrow Angle Camera, and a Sub-Surface Radar.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method that}} {{is widely used}} in these {{analyses}} is mass spectrometry. Here, accurate measurement {{of the mass of}} the unmodified native enzyme and the inactivated enzyme gives the increase in mass caused by reaction with the inhibitor and shows the stoichiometry of the reaction. This is usually done using a MALDI-TOF mass <b>spectrometer.</b> In a complementary technique, peptide mass fingerprinting involves digestion of the native and modified protein with a protease such as trypsin. This will produce a set of peptides that can be analysed using a mass <b>spectrometer.</b> The peptide that changes in mass after reaction with the inhibitor will be the one that contains the site of modification.|$|E

5|$|Europa Clipper — In July 2013 {{an updated}} concept for a flyby Europa mission called Europa Clipper was {{presented}} by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). In May 2015, NASA announced that it had accepted development of the Europa Clipper mission, and revealed the instruments it will use. The aim of Europa Clipper is to explore Europa in order to investigate its habitability, and to aid selecting sites for a future lander. The Europa Clipper would not orbit Europa, but instead orbit Jupiter and conduct 45 low-altitude flybys of Europa during its envisioned mission. The probe would carry an ice-penetrating radar, short-wave infrared <b>spectrometer,</b> topographical imager, and an ion- and neutral-mass <b>spectrometer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fig.8 {{illustrates}} {{the operation of}} a Fourier transform <b>spectrometer,</b> which is essentially a Michelson interferometer with one mirror movable. (A practical Fourier transform <b>spectrometer</b> would substitute corner cube reflectors for the flat mirrors of the conventional Michelson interferometer, but for simplicity, the illustration does not show this.) An interferogram is generated by making measurements of the signal at many discrete positions of the moving mirror. A Fourier transform converts the interferogram into an actual spectrum.|$|E
40|$|Small size, wide {{spectral}} bandwidth, {{and highly}} multiplexed detector readout {{are required to}} develop powerful multi-beam <b>spectrometers</b> for high-redshift observations. Currently available <b>spectrometers</b> at these frequencies are large and bulky. The grating sizes for these <b>spectrometers</b> are prohibitive. This fundamental size issue is a key limitation for space-based <b>spectrometers</b> for astrophysics applications. A novel, moderate-resolving-power (R- 700), ultra-compact spectrograph-on-a-chip for millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths is the solution...|$|R
30|$|Wider-band {{spectroscopy}} {{with more}} frequency channels {{is a general}} requirement for <b>spectrometers.</b> Increasing the frequency channels requires more signal processing resources in FPGAs. Improvement in the signal processing algorithm will be essential for future digital <b>spectrometers.</b> The parallel FFT processing in FPGAs (Nakahara et al. 2013, 2014, 2015) would improve future digital <b>spectrometers.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are {{different}} types of ion mobility <b>spectrometers</b> and there {{are different}} types of mass <b>spectrometers.</b> In principle {{it is possible to}} combine every type of the former with any type of the latter. However, in the real world, {{different types of}} ion mobility are coupled with different types of mass <b>spectrometers</b> to achieve reasonable sensitivity (will be discussed later).|$|R

5|$|Although the {{extraction}} process, using low-temperature gas liquefaction, was not developed {{in time to}} be significant during World War I, production continued. Helium was primarily used as a lifting gas in lighter-than-air craft. During World War II, the demand increased for helium for lifting gas and for shielded arc welding. The helium mass <b>spectrometer</b> was also vital in the atomic bomb Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|An atom can be ionized by {{removing}} {{one of its}} electrons. The electric charge causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through a magnetic field. The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field {{is determined by the}} mass of the atom. The mass <b>spectrometer</b> uses this principle to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass <b>spectrometer</b> can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.|$|E
50|$|Imaging <b>spectrometers</b> {{are meant}} to produce well {{resolved}} images. In order for this to occur, imaging <b>spectrometers</b> {{need to be made}} with few optical surfaces and have no aspherical optical surfaces.|$|R

5|$|An {{expert system}} is a program that answers {{questions}} or solves problems about a specific domain of knowledge, using logical rules that are derived from the knowledge of experts. The earliest examples were developed by Edward Feigenbaum and his students. Dendral, begun in 1965, identified compounds from <b>spectrometer</b> readings. MYCIN, developed in 1972, diagnosed infectious blood diseases. They demonstrated the feasibility of the approach.|$|E
5|$|CORALIE and the High Resolution Echelle <b>Spectrometer</b> (HIRES) {{revealed}} {{the spectrum of}} WASP-15, which was used to derive the star's characteristics.

5|$|Einsteinium-254 {{was used}} as the {{calibration}} marker in the chemical analysis <b>spectrometer</b> ("alpha-scattering surface analyzer") of the Surveyor 5 lunar probe.

40|$|Spectral and radiometric {{calibrations}} of AVIRIS {{are described}} together {{with changes in}} instrument characteristics {{that occurred during the}} flight season. These changes include detachment of the optical fibers to two of the four AVIRIS <b>spectrometers,</b> degradation in the optical alignment of the <b>spectrometers</b> due to thermally induced and mechanical warpage, and breakage of a thermal blocking filter in one of the <b>spectrometers.</b> Means of improving the instrument are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Optical <b>spectrometers,</b> {{and mass}} <b>spectrometers</b> {{to a lesser}} extent, have a long and rich history of use aboard spacecraft. Space mission {{applications}} include deep space science spacecraft, earth orbiting satellites, atmospheric probes, and surface landers, rovers, and penetrators. The large size of capable instruments limited their use to large, expensive spacecraft. Because of the novel application of micro-fabrication technologies, compact optical and mass <b>spectrometers</b> are now available. The new compact devices are especially attractive for spacecraft because of their small mass and volume, {{as well as their}} low power consumption. Dispersive optical multi-channel analyzers which cover the 0. 4 - 1. 1 micrometer wavelength are now commercially available in packages as small as 3 x 6 x 18 mm exclusive of drive and recording electronics. Mass <b>spectrometers</b> as small as 3 x 3 mm, again without electronics, are under development. A variety of compact optical and mass <b>spectrometers</b> are reviewed in this paper. A number of past space applications are described, along with some upcoming opportunities that are likely candidate missions to fly this new class of compact <b>spectrometers...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} and identification {{of toxic chemicals}} released in the environment is important for public safety. Passive-remote Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) <b>spectrometers</b> {{can be used to}} detect these releases. Their primary advantages are their small size and ease of setup and use. Open-path FTIR <b>spectrometers</b> are used to detect concentrations of pollutants from a fixed frame of reference. These instruments detect plumes, but they are too large and difficult to aim to be used to track a plume to its source. Passive remote FTIR <b>spectrometers</b> contain an interferometer, optics, and a detector. They can be used on tripods and in some cases can be hand-held. A telescope can be added to most units. We will discuss the capability of passive-remote FTIR <b>spectrometers</b> to detect the origin of plumes. Low concentration plumes were released using a custom-constructed vaporizer. These plumes were detected with different <b>spectrometers</b> from different distances. Passive-remote <b>spectrometers</b> were able to detect small 10 cm on a side chemical releases at concentration-pathlengths at the low parts per million-meter (ppm-m) level...|$|R

On December 21, 2008, Cassini passed directly over Ontario Lacus and observed specular reflection in radar. The strength of the reflection saturated the probe's receiver, indicating that the lake level did not vary by more than 3mm (implying either that surface winds were minimal, or the lake's hydrocarbon fluid is viscous).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a practical method {{for the development}} of spectral reflectance libraries under sub-optimal sky conditions. Although there are commercially available <b>spectrometers</b> which simultaneously measure both downwelling and upwelling radiance to mitigate the impact of sub-optimal sky conditions, these <b>spectrometers</b> only record in the visible and near infra-red. There are presently no commercially available <b>spectrometers</b> with this capability that can record the visible through short-wave infra-red. This paper {{presents a}} practical method of recording and processing data using coordinated measurements from two full-range <b>spectrometers</b> and discusses potential pitfalls and solutions required to achieve accurate reflectance spectra. Results demonstrate that high-quality spectral reflectance libraries can be developed with this approach...|$|R
5|$|Similar to {{photoluminescence}} mapping, {{the energy}} of the excitation light can be scanned in Raman measurements, thus producing Raman maps. Those maps also contain oval-shaped features uniquely identifying (n,m) indices. Contrary to PL, Raman mapping detects not only semiconducting but also metallic tubes, and it is less sensitive to nanotube bundling than PL. However, requirement of a tunable laser and a dedicated <b>spectrometer</b> is a strong technical impediment.|$|E
