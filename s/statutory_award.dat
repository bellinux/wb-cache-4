50|$|Statutory damages are {{an amount}} stipulated within the statute rather than {{calculated}} {{based on the}} degree of harm to the plaintiff. Lawmakers will provide for statutory damages for acts in which {{it is difficult to determine}} the value of the harm to the victim. Mere violation of the law can entitle the victim to a <b>statutory</b> <b>award,</b> even if no actual injury occurred. These are similar to, but different from, nominal damages (see below), in which no written sum is specified.|$|E

40|$|Record labels {{have brought}} {{thousands}} of copyright infringement lawsuits against individuals {{engaged in the}} online downloading and distribution of music. As these lawsuits work {{their way through the}} court system, a debate has emerged over the constitutionality of the large <b>statutory</b> damage <b>awards</b> some juries have awarded. In arguing that the copyright statute results in unconstitutional damage awards, commentators as well as defendants accused of copyright infringement contend that courts should apply the rigorous standard of review for punitive damages that the U. S. Supreme Court adopted in BMW of North America v. Gore to find large <b>statutory</b> damage <b>awards</b> unconstitutional. But the record labels and numerous commentators maintain that Gore has no place in the review of statutory damages. They instead argue that the deferential review the Court outlined in St. Louis, Iron Mountain 2 ̆ 6 Southern Railway Co. v. Williams is the proper standard, and that under this standard, <b>statutory</b> damage <b>awards</b> are constitutional. This Note seeks to resolve the conflict over the proper standard of constitutional review for statutory damages in copyright infringement lawsuits. It concludes that courts should apply the Williams standard to statutory damages because of the substantial differences between <b>statutory</b> and punitive <b>awards,</b> but they should apply it more rigorously than in the past to ensure that all <b>statutory</b> damage <b>awards</b> for copyright infringement satisfy due process...|$|R
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} that courts use to determine an appropriate <b>statutory</b> damage <b>award</b> in a copyright infringement case {{is the number of}} infringements of a copyright. How does a court determine the number of infringements when one infringing article has been printed six times in over one hundred copies of a magazine? Before the Copyright Act of 1976 went into effect, many courts adhered to the 2 ̆ 2 multiplicity doctrine 2 ̆ 2 and would have <b>awarded</b> <b>statutory</b> damages in the above scenarios for each of the six times that the infringing article was printed or the infringing song was played. Post- 1976, however, most courts have interpreted the 1976 Act 2 ̆ 7 s language as abolishing the practice of <b>awarding</b> <b>statutory</b> damages for each infringing work, instead <b>awarding</b> <b>statutory</b> damages for each infringed work. In 2004, the First Circuit reaffirmed this interpretation in Venegas-Hernandez v. Sonolux Records. Although the law may appear to be well-settled, two questions remain. First, does this interpretation of the 1976 Act actually deter prospective infringers-one of the goals of copyright law? And, second, does this interpretation promote good public policy? Evidence seems to suggest that the answers to both of these questions are in the negative...|$|R

40|$|U. S. {{copyright}} law gives successful plaintiffs who promptly registered their works {{the ability to}} elect to receive an <b>award</b> of <b>statutory</b> damages, which can be granted in any amount between $ 750 and $ 150, 000 per infringed work. This provision gives scant guidance about where in that range awards should be made, {{other than to say}} that the award should be in amount the court “considers just,” and that {{the upper end of the}} spectrum, from $ 30, 000 to $ 150, 000 per infringed work, is reserved for awards against “willful” infringers. Courts have largely failed to develop a jurisprudence to guide decision-making about compensatory <b>statutory</b> damage <b>awards</b> in ordinary infringement cases or about strong deterrent or punitive damage awards in willful infringement cases. As a result, <b>awards</b> of <b>statutory</b> damages are frequently arbitrary, inconsistent, unprincipled, and sometimes grossly excessive. This Article argues that such awards are not only inconsistent with Congressional intent in establishing the statutory damage regime, but also with principles of due process articulated in the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence on punitive damage awards. Drawing upon some cases in which <b>statutory</b> damage <b>awards</b> have been consistent with Congressional intent and with the due process jurisprudence, this Article articulates principles upon which a sound jurisprudence for copyright <b>statutory</b> damage <b>awards</b> could be built. Nevertheless, legislative reform of the U. S. statutory damage rules may be desirable...|$|R

50|$|After {{both parties}} appealed, the First Circuit Court of Appeals {{reinstated}} the original damage award of $675,000 and remanded {{the case to}} the District Court, ruling that the judge should have avoided the constitutional issue by first considering remittitur. The Supreme Court refused to hear Tenenbaum's appeal arguing against the remand. A new District Court judge then found no cause for remittitur, and held that the <b>statutory</b> damage <b>award</b> was constitutional. Tenenbaum again appealed to the First Circuit, which in June 2013 upheld the award.|$|R
5000|$|On July 9, 2010, Judge Gertner reduced Tenenbaum's fines to $67,500, {{holding that}} {{arbitrarily}} high statutory damages violate {{due process and}} are thus unconstitutional, [...] "far greater than necessary to serve the government's legitimate interests in compensating copyright owners and deterring infringement. In fact, it bears no meaningful relationship to these objectives. To borrow Chief Judge Michael J. Davis' characterization of a smaller <b>statutory</b> damages <b>award</b> in an analogous file-sharing case, the award here is simply 'unprecedented and oppressive.'" [...] On July 21, 2010, both parties filed notice to appeal the ruling.|$|R
50|$|The appeal {{broached}} several topics, one {{of which}} was the District Court's authority to reduce a <b>statutory</b> damage <b>award</b> on constitutional grounds. Two Supreme Court cases were cited: BMW of North America, Inc. v. Gore and St. Louis, I.M. & S. Ry. Co. v. Williams. Tenenbaum argued for the application of the Gore standard, which regards punitive damage awards as eligible for reduction, and allows actual damages to be taken into consideration. The record companies and the U.S. Government countered that statutory damages and punitive damages are different things, so the Williams standard, which is less stringent than Gore, should apply.|$|R
50|$|Also on July 6, 2009, Thomas-Rasset filed {{a motion}} asserting the <b>statutory</b> damage <b>award</b> was so disproportionate to actual damages as to be unconstitutional, and announcing her {{intention}} to appeal two prior court orders permitting the plaintiffs to present certain evidence at trial. The evidence in question included allegedly incomplete and therefore inadmissible copyright registrations, and Thomas-Rasset claimed that evidence collected by MediaSentry should have been inadmissible because it was collected in violation of state private investigator and wiretap statutes. The motion called for either a retrial with that evidence suppressed, a reduction of damages to the statutory minimum ($750 per song; $18,000 total), or a removal of statutory damages altogether.|$|R
50|$|In Capitol v. Thomas, a Minnesota {{mother was}} ordered to pay $222,000 ($9,250 per song) in damages to the RIAA for {{illegally}} sharing 24 songs on Kazaa. Before they first sued, the RIAA offered a settlement of $5,000, which Thomas refused. She later refused a second settlement of $25,000, {{which would have been}} donated to music industry persons in need. After three trials and multiple appeals, at one point of which <b>statutory</b> damages <b>awarded</b> were $1,920,000, the Supreme Court refused to hear Thomas’s case in March 2013. Thomas maintains that it will be impossible theRIAA to collect the $222,000 fee due to her inability to pay.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the case, lower {{federal courts}} had split over whether plaintiffs whose rights were {{violated}} were automatically {{entitled to the}} <b>statutory</b> minimum damages <b>award</b> of $1000, or whether those plaintiffs had {{to prove that they}} had suffered at least some actual damage from the privacy breach (which would then be raised to $1000 if their actual damages were less than that).|$|R

50|$|Judge Gertner {{presided over}} Sony BMG v. Tenenbaum, a civil trial {{in which the}} Recording Industry Association of America accused Joel Tenenbaum, a Massachusetts college student, of {{illegally}} downloading and sharing files, thus violating U.S. copyright law. In July 2009, a jury awarded $675,000 to the music companies, but Judge Gertner later reduced the award to $67,500, stating that arbitrarily high statutory damages violate due process and are thus unconstitutional. After both parties appealed, the First Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the original damage award of $675,000 and remanded {{the case to the}} District Court, ruling that the judge should have avoided the constitutional issue by first considering remittitur. The Supreme Court refused to hear Tenenbaum's appeal arguing against the remand.

5000|$|The {{court found}} that the {{defendant}} had infringed the copyrights {{of two of the}} plaintiffs - Morgan Stanley and Barclays Capital. To satisfy these requirements, Morgan Stanley provided eight research reports and Barclays Capital provided nine research reports (a total of seventeen research reports), their associated registration certificates, and seventeen corresponding examples of the defendant's [...] "direct, verbatim copying of key excerpts." [...] While throughout the pre-trial process, Fly defended its copying of the reports as fair use under , at trial, the defendant did not dispute that it infringed the copyrights in these seventeen reports. As such, the court ruled in favor of these two plaintiffs and ordered the defendant to pay them nominal damages, pre-judgment interest on the <b>statutory</b> damage <b>awards,</b> and attorney's fees. The court further ordered a permanent injunction such that the defendant was disallowed from further infringement of [...] "any portion of the copyrighted elements of any research reports" [...] generated by those two plaintiffs.|$|R
40|$|Recently, two popular {{topics of}} {{discussion}} within {{intellectual property law}} have been the statutory damage regime and the legality of peer-to-peer (P 2 P) downloading. This Note examines a rarely discussed interplay between these two concepts: the innocent infringement defense. Innocent infringement allows a court to dramatically reduce the minimum <b>statutory</b> damage <b>award</b> for an act of copyright infringement from $ 750 to $ 200 per act. Both the Fifth and Seventh Circuits have found that § 402 (d) of the Copyright Act eliminates innocent infringement {{as a matter of}} law in a P 2 P download setting. This Note examines those circuits’ reasoning as well as the various responses from the legal academic community. It argues against those circuits’ interpretation of the phrase “access to published phonorecords,” found in § 402 (d), to mean a general availability and a duty to inquire as to the copyright status of the songs in question. By viewing § 402 (d) in this light, those courts have effectively eliminated the defense when applied to P 2 P downloading. This Note advocates for an actual inquiry into a defendant’s state of mind to determine if they had “reason to believe” their actions constituted infringement, which would preserve innocent infringement in a digital environment...|$|R
50|$|After remand and {{the jury}} trial ordered by the Supreme Court, the jury <b>awarded</b> $72,000 in <b>statutory</b> damages {{for each of the}} 440 works infringed, for a total award of $31.68 million - over three and a half times the damages awarded by the Judge at the prior bench trial. On his appeal from the $31.68 million jury award to the Ninth Circuit, Feltner argued that the Supreme Court’s rulings (that the Copyright Act {{provided}} that <b>statutory</b> damages be <b>awarded</b> by Judges and the Seventh Amendment required that juries award those damaged) rendered statutory damages unconstitutional and void. The Ninth Circuit rejected this argument and affirmed the $31.68 million jury award. Feltner’s petition to the Supreme Court to hear the case for a second time was unsuccessful, leaving the $31.68 million award intact.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Assess {{the odds}} of having an initial claim for <b>statutory</b> {{sickness}} benefit <b>awarded</b> (ascribed to mental disorder as the main registered diagnosis), in relation to institutional, clinical, sociodemographic and welfare factors in Juiz de Fora-MG, Brazil. METHOD: Two models of logistic regression, {{taking into account the}} categories of the medical examiners, were built with the aim of characterizing the relative weight of several variables affecting the medical conclusion. RESULTS: The factors more strongly related to an award of benefit were a claimant assessed by a physician without a specialization in psychiatry; with a diagnosis of psychosis; up to 29 years of age; with other non-psychiatric (musculoskeletal and cardiovascular) co-morbidities; registered with the national insurance system as employed; and male. DISCUSSION: In both models, examiners with a specialization in psychiatry were associated with a lower likelihood of award of benefit. This suggests that examinations undertaken by doctors having a specialty related to the diagnosis supporting the sickness benefit claim are stricter than those undertaken by non-specialists. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that benefit award odds were associated with the specialty of the examiner, medical diagnosis, age, gender and claimant category...|$|R
