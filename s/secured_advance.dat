The {{garrison}} of the out-posts were all killed by the subadar and his men, by kukri or bayonet and the next machine-gun posts were dealt with similarly. This officer then continued to fight his way up the bullet-swept approaches to the crest where he and the riflemen with him killed four - the rest fled. Thus <b>secured,</b> <b>advance</b> by the whole division was made possible.|$|E
50|$|The soldier will be {{equipped}} with a USB 2.0. digital data bus, Palmtop GPS navigation device, <b>secured</b> <b>advance</b> audio communication set, advance electronic warfare data manager, secured network connection where each radio can subscribe to two networks simultaneously. This offers the squad leader some flexibility in organizing communication networks in his section. Each network has an audio conference channel, with priority given to the squad leader, an alert channel from the infantryman to his leader, and a data transmission channel. Voice and data transmissions are based on tried and tested civilian technology (domestic cordless telephone technology). Each sub-network works from a base carried by the squad leader. As RIF sets are all identical, a soldier can replace his commander if necessary by configuring his set as base. The radio is configured by the computer, thereby {{limiting the number of}} control buttons needed on the set. The soldier might be able to communicate with other soldiers and locate or generate maps to find his location, and he will be aware of the situation on the battlefield. The palmtop will inform soldiers where other friendly forces are in relation to them. It will also enable them to transfer messages. Terrain equipment for various specific missions will also be carried.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we have {{proposed}} a method for an RGB image encryption supported by lifting scheme based lossless compression. Firstly we have compressed the input color image using a 2 -D integer wavelet transform. Then we have applied lossless predictive coding to achieve additional compression. The compressed image is encrypted by using <b>Secure</b> <b>Advanced</b> Hill Cipher (SAHC) involving a pair of involutory matrices, a function called Mix() and an operation called XOR. Decryption followed by reconstruction shows {{that there is no}} difference between the output image and the input image. The proposed method can be used for efficient and secure transmission of image data.

The most common computer authentication method is to use alphanumeric user name and passwords. User often creates passwords that are memorable which is easy for attackers to guess, but strong system assigned passwords are difficult for users to remember. So researchers of modern days have gone for alternative methods where in graphical picture are used as a password. By using graphical password scheme shoulder surfing attack, masquerading and eavesdropping can be minimized. In this paper, we have changed the way of clicking on the images and to make the password more <b>secure</b> <b>Advanced</b> Encryption Standard (AES) technique is used so that authentication can become more secure and password can be generated, authenticated & protected easily.
