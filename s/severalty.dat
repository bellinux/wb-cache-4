40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the changes in settlement and field systems of the Bishop of Durham's Middleham Manor during the decline of the old methods of farming and the emergence of the now between 1600 and 1850. By 1600 the nucleated rural settlement pattern of surviving villages and deserted sites had been established and formed the basis of the 1650 pattern including the surviving Middleham Manor villages of Bishop Middleham, Sedgefield and Cornforth. In neighbouring, non-eccliastical townships, which by 1850 were part of the parishes of Sedgefield and Bishop Middleham, there were extant villages and deserted sites occupied by individual farms or farm clusters. In 1600, the townships of Middleham Manor presented a champion landscape of large open fields, meadows and pastures. But enclosure in the form of <b>severalties</b> and Lammas closes had already made inroads into lands held in common. The dispersion of farmstalls from the village tofts had not yet taken place, and there wore ownership links between the village holdings and those in the township fields and pastures. Freed from the constraints of communal agriculture, the 17 th century enclosure allotments proved enduring as alienable blocks in the land market. They also affected the 1850 pattern of enclosed farms with close correlation between farm and allotment boundaries. New agricultural practices were slow to develop with medieval tenures persisting into the 19 th century and new crops and rotations not introduced until a relatively late date. In 1850 plot patterns in the villages remained the same with minor sub divisions. In most cases the farmstalls then occupied sites in the fields while village tofts were used for other purposes. The localised and internal contrasts in landscape, farming and territorial organisation derive {{from the fact that the}} lands of Middleham Manor were held 'in demesne' with tenants answering directly to the Halmote Court (until 1926) ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD(Agric)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2000. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Little is {{understood}} regarding flowering in the genus Protea. The information available on inflorescence initiation {{and development in}} the family Proteaceae was reviewed and discussed. A number of experiments were conducted to investigate inflorescence initiation and development, and their manipulation for commercial production, in selected Protea cultivars, in the Western Cape, South Africa (33 Â°S, Protea species can be allocated into groups according to similar times of flower initiation and of harvest. The stages occurring during flower initiation, and their synchrony relative to shoot growth were investigated for three cultivars, viz. Protea cv. Carnival (P. compacta x P. neriifolia), Protea cv. Lady Di (P. compacta x P. magnifica) and Protea cv. Sylvia (P. eximia x P. susannae), when flower initiation occurred on the spring growth flush. For all three cultivars the spring flush was preformed and enclosed in the apical bud before spring budbreak. During elongation of the spring flush the apical meristem produced floral primordia which differentiated into involucral bracts. After completion of the spring flush meristematic activity continued, to produce floral bracts with florets in their axils. The three cultivars showed differences and similarities {{in the time of}} budbreak, and the rates of shoot growth, appendage formation and flower development. The presence of mature leaves on an over-wintering shoot is essential for inflorescence initiation on the spring growth flush of 'Carnival'. Inflorescence initiation in 'Carnival' started at spring budbreak, and production of involucral bracts occurred concurrently with spring flush elongation. Shoots were defoliated at different degrees of severity at intervals from pre- to post- spring budbreak. Total defoliation applied earlier than 6 - 7 weeks before spring budbreak prevented flowering. Defoliation closer to spring budbreak affected characteristics of the spring flush and the inflorescence subtended by the spring flush. Effects were most marked following total defoliation and diminished with less severe treatments imposed by partial defoliation. Total defoliation applied before spring budbreak resulted in slower inflorescence development and lead to later anthesis. Defoliation treatments applied after completion of spring flush elongation had no effect on either vegetative or reproductive spring growth. The requirement for mature overwintering leaves to effect inflorescence initiation in 'Carnival' suggests that environmental factors, such as low temperature and daylength may play an inductive role. Shoots were in the induced state and committed to flowering 6 - 7 weeks before spring budbreak. A change in source size and position subsequent to different <b>severalties</b> of defoliation in 'Carnival' lead to reduced dry mass accumulation and altered partitioning. Mature leaves on the overwintering shoot supported growth of the spring flush and the early stages of inflorescence development. When these leaves were removed by total defoliation dry mass accumulation in the spring flush was reduced. A hierarchy of priorities between competing sinks was revealed by defoliation during growth of the spring flush and concomitant inflorescence development: formation of involucral bracts> leaf growth> stem elongation. Dry mass accumulation of the inflorescence subtended by the spring flush was supported by the spring flush leaves and was only indirectly affected by defoliation. Treatments which resulted in the production of a weaker spring flush lead to a reduction in dry mass accumulation of the inflorescence. Different <b>severalties</b> of partial defoliation, whereby either upper or lower leaves were removed from a shoot, indicated that the position of leaves relative to the active sink is more important, with respect to source availability, than the number of leaves on the shoot. Mature overwintering leaves are essential in 'Lady Di' for shoots to achieve the induced state for flowering; and are also crucial to the early stages of inflorescence initiation. Defoliation applied before formation of involucral bracts was complete prevented flowering. Defoliated shoots either remained vegetative or produced inflorescences which aborted. Reserve carbohydrates in the stem and leaves of overwintering shoots were low, and early growth and development of both the spring flush and inflorescence were, therefore, supported by current photosynthates from the overwintering leaves. Likewise, reserve carbohydrates available in the flowering shoot were insufficient to account for the dry mass increase during the major portion of growth of the spring flush and inflorescence. This rapid increase in dry mass occurred after elongation of the spring flush was complete and was supported by current photosynthates from the leaves of the spring flush. Defoliation treatments that did not prevent inflorescence initiation, had no effect on inflorescence development, and flowering time of 'Lady Di' was not delayed by defoliation. 'Sylvia' has an open window for inflorescence initiation and can initiate flowers throughout the year. Despite the 'open window' inflorescences are initiated more readily on the spring flush, when it is subtended by one or more overwintering shoots. This may be the expression of a facultative response to inductive conditions for which 'Carnival' and 'Lady Di' have an obligate requirement. The date of pruning affected flowering time of 'Sylvia' by influencing on which flush inflorescence initiation occurred, and the harvest could be manipulated to fall within the optimum marketing period for export to Europe. Flowers initiated on the spring flush reach anthesis in January and February; on the first summer flush predominantly in April and May; on the second summer flush in July and August; and on the autumn flush in November and December. Thus, shoots harvested within the optimum marketing period (September to February) initiated inflorescences on the autumn and spring flushes. Due to the readiness of shoots to initiate inflorescences on the spring flush many shoots harvested in January and February (following initiation in the previous spring) were short and were rendered unmarketable. For commercial production pruning in July is recommended. Long flowering stems will be harvested in October to November of the following year. Since the vegetative and reproductive cycles necessary to produce inflorescences on long stems span more than a year, a biennial cropping system is recommended. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Bloeiwyse-inisiasie en -ontwikkeling, en die manipulasie daarvan, van geselekteerde cultivars van die genus Protea. Min word verstaan van blomvorming in die genus Protea. Die beskikbare inligting oor die bloeiwyse-inisiasie en -ontwikkeling in die familie Proteaceae is nagegaan en bespreek. 'n Aantal eksperimente is uitgevoer waarin geselekteerde Protea cultivars van die Wes-Kaap, Suid-Afrika (33 Â°S, 19 Â° 0) se bloeiwyse-inisiasie en -ontwikkeling, asook die manipulasie daarvan vir kommersiÃ«le produksie ondersoek is. Protea spesies kan in groepe ingedeel word op grond van blominisiasietye en oestye wat ooreenstem. Die verskillende stadiums van blominisiasie en hulle sinchronisering relatieftot stingelgroei is ondersoek vir drie kultivars, naamlik Protea cv. Carnival (P. compacta x P. neriifolia), Protea cv. Lady Di (P. compacta x P. magnifica) en Protea cv. Sylvia (P. eximia x P. susannae) tydens blominisiasie op die lentegroeistuwing. By al drie die kultivars was die lentegroeistuwing reeds gevorm en omsluit in die apikale knop voor die lente-knopbreking. Gedurende die verlenging van die lentegroeistuwing het die apikale meristeem blomprimordia, wat in bloeiwyseomwindselskutblare gedifferensieer het, geproduseer. Na voltooiing van die lentegroeistuwing, het meristematiese aktiwiteit voortgeduur en blomskutblare met blommetjies in hulle oksels is gevorm. Die drie kultivars het verskille en ooreenkomste vertoon tydens die periode van knopbreking, asook in die tempo van stingelgroei, aanhangselformasie en blomontwikkeling. Die teenwoordigheid van volwasse blare op 'n oorwinteringstingel is noodsaaklik vit bloeiwyse-inisiasie op die lentegroeistuwing van 'Carnival'. Bloeiwyse-inisiasie in 'Carnival' het met lente-knopbreking begin en die produksie van bloeiwyseomwindselblare het gelyktydig met lentegroeistuwing verlenging plaasgevind. Stingels is met tussenposes, van voor tot na die lente-knopbreking, en met verskillende grade van felheid, ontblaar. Algehele ontblaring vroeÃ«r as 6 - 7 weke voor die lente-knopbreking het blomvorming verhoed. Ontblaring nader aan die lenteknopbreking het 'n invloed gehad op die eienskappe van die lentegroeistuwing asook die bloeiwyse gedra deur die lentegroeistuwing. Die effek was die duidelikste sigbaar by algehele ontblaring en het verminder namate die behandeling minder fel geword het by gedeeltelike ontblaring. Algehele ontblaring wat voor die lente-knopbreking gedoen is, het gelei tot stadiger bloeiwyse-ontwikkeling en later antese. Ontblaringsbehandelings wat na die voltooiing van die lentegroeistuwing verlenging toegepas is, het geen effek op die vegetatiewe of die reproduktiewe lentegroei gehad me. Die nodigheid van volwasse oorwinteringsblare vir bloeiwyse-inisiasie in 'Carnival' dui daarop dat omgewingsfaktore soos lae temperature en daglengte 'n induktiewe rol kan speel. Stingels was in die geÃ¯nduseerde toestand en verbind tot blomvorming 6 - 7 weke voor die lente-knopbreking. 'n Verandering in oorspronggrootte en -posisie as gevolg van verskille in die felheid van ontblaring by 'Carnival', het gelei tot verminderde droÃ«-massa-akkumulasie en veranderde verdeling. Volwasse blare op die oorwinteringstingel het die groei van die lentegroeistuwing en die vroeÃ« stadiums van bloeiwyse-ontwikkeling ondersteun. Toe hierdie blare verwyder is in 'n algehele ontblaring, het die droÃ«-massa-akkumulasie in die lentegroeistuwing verminder. 'n HiÃ«rargie van prioriteite tussen kompeterende sinke is blootgelÃª tydens ontblaring gedurende die lentegroeistuwing en saamlopende bloeiwyse-ontwikkeling: vorming van bloeiwyse-omwindselblare > blaargroei > stamverlenging. DroÃ«-massa-akkumulasie van die bloeiwyse onderspan deur die lentegroeistuwing is ondersteun deur die blare van die lentegroeistuwing en is slegs op 'n indirekte wyse deur ontblaring geaffekteer. Behandelings wat tot die produksie van 'n swakker lentegroeistuwing gelei het, het tot 'n vermindering in die droÃ«-massaakkumulasie van die bloeiwyse gelei. Verskille in die felheid van gedeeltelike ontblaring, waartydens Ã³f die boonste Ã³f die onderste blare van 'n stingel verwyder is, het aangetoon dat die posisie van die blare relatief tot die aktiewe sink belangriker is, met betrekking tot die beskikbaarheid van die oorsprong, as die aantal blare op die stingel. By 'Lady Di' is volwasse oorwinteringsblare noodsaaklik VIr stingels om die geÃ¯nduseerde stadium van blomvorming te bereik en hulle is ook van die uiterste belang in die vroeÃ« stadiums van bloeiwyse-inisiasie. Waar ontblaring gedoen is voordat die vorming van bloeiwyse-omwindsel voltooi was, het blomvorming nie plaasgevind nie. Ontblaarde stingels het Ã³fvegetatief gebly Ã³fbloeiwyses geproduseer wat geaborteer het. Reserwe-koolhidrate in die stam en blare van die oorwinteringstingels was laag en die vroeÃ« groei en ontwikkeling van beide die lentegroeistuwing en die bloeiwyse is dus deur die bestaande fotosintate van die oorwinteringsblare onderhou. Net so was die reserwe-koolhidrate beskikbaar in die blomdraende stingels nie voldoende om die toename in droÃ« massa gedurende die grootste deel van die groei van die lentegroeistuwing en die bloeiwyse te verklaar nie. Hierdie vinnige toename in droÃ« massa het plaasgevind nadat die verlenging van die lentegroeistuwing voltooi was en is deur die bestaande fotosintate van die blare van die lentegroeistuwing onderhou. Ontblaringsbehandelings wat nie bloeiwyse-inisiasie verhoed het nie, het geen effek op bloeiwyse-ontwikkeling gehad nie en die blomtyd van 'Lady Di' is nie deur ontblaring vertraag nie. 'Sylvia' beskik oor 'n oop venster vir bloeiwyse-inisiasie en kan regdeur die jaar blomme inisieer. Ten spyte van die 'oop venster', word bloeiwyses tog meer geredelik in die lentegroeistuwing geÃ¯nisieer, wanneer dit deur een of meer van die oorwinteringstingels gedra word. Dit mag die uitdrukking wees van 'n fakultatiewe respons op induktiewe toestande wat vir 'Carnival' en 'Lady Di' 'n verpligte vereiste is. 'Sylvia' se blomtyd is deur die snoeidatum geaffekteer omdat die snoeidatum 'n invloed gehad het op die keuse van by watter groeistuwing bloeiwyse-inisiasie plaasgevind het. Die oestyd kon gemanipuleer word om binne die optimum bemarkingstydperk vir uitvoer na Europa te val. Blomme wat op die lentegroeistuwing geÃ¯nisieer is, bereik antese in Januarie en Februarie; diÃ© wat op die eerste somergroeistuwing geÃ¯nisieer is, bereik antese hoofsaaklik in April en Mei; diÃ© wat op die tweede somergroeistuwing geÃ¯nisieer is, bereik antese in Julie en Augustus en diÃ© wat op die herfsgroeistuwing geÃ¯nisieer is, bereik antese in November en Desember. Stingels wat in die optimum bemarkingsperiode (September tot Februarie) geoes is, het dus bloeiwyses op die herfs- en lente-groeistuwings geÃ¯nisieer. As gevolg van die gereedheid van stingels om bloeiwyses op die lentegroeistuwings te inisieer, was baie van die stingels wat in Januarie en Februarie geoes is, kort en kon nie bemark word nie. Vir kommersiÃ«le doeleindes word snoei in Julie aanbeveel. Lang blomdraende stingels sal in Oktober en November van die volgende jaar geoes word. Aangesien die vegetatiewe en reproduktiewe siklusse wat nodig is om bloeiwyses met lang stingels te produseer oor meer as fn jaar strek, word fn tweejaarlikse oesinsamelingstelsel aanbeveel...|$|R

Besides this suggestion I should like to offer a warning, and this is, that no matter with what devoted passion the American lover of London approaches her he must not hope for an exclusive possession of her heart. If she is insurpassably the most interesting, the most fascinating of all the cities that ever were, let him be sure that he is not the first to find it out. He may not like it, but he must reconcile himself to seeing some English rival before him in devotion to any aspect of her divinity. It is not for nothing that poets, novelists, historians, antiquarians have been born in England for so many ages; and not a palm's breadth of her sky, not a foot of her earth, not a stone or brick of her myriad wallspaces but has been fondly noted, studied, and described in prose, or celebrated in verse. English books are full of England, and she is full of Englishmen, whom the American, come he never so numerously, will find outnumbering him in the pursuit of any specific charm of hers. In my wanderings otherwhere in their islands I had occasion to observe how fond the English were of English travel and English objects of interest, and wherever I went in London there were Englishmen elbowing me from the front rank, not rudely, not unkindly, but insensibly to my rights of priority as an alien. In the old days of my Italian travels I had been used as a foreigner to carrying it with a high hand at shrines of the beautiful or memorable.

With changing government policies the school declined and was closed in 1953.|$|E
5000|$|In 1887, when Congress {{enacted the}} Dawes <b>Severalty</b> Act of 1887 â {{breaking}} up the reservations and allotting a 160 acre plot to the registered head of each family â the Whiteclay Extension was specifically exempted. On March 2, 1889 the U.S. Congress enacted the Great Sioux Agreement of March 2, 1889, 25 Stat. 888, {{breaking up the}} Great Sioux Reservation and setting boundaries for the six reduced reservations. In this act, the White Clay Extension was incorporated again {{within the boundaries of}} the Pine Ridge Agency. [...] "Provided, That the said tract of land in the State of Nebraska shall be reserved, by Executive order, only so long as it may be needed for the use and protection of the Indians receiving rations and annuities at the Pine Ridge Agency." ...|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the land}} belonged {{exclusively}} to the Otoe prior to the exchange, the government worked to secure agreement by the Omaha, Iowa, and Yankton and Santee bands of Sioux to pay the Otoe $3000 {{for the rights of}} their [...] "half-breeds" [...] to live on the reservation. Original plans were for land ownership to be held in common, as other American Indian land titles were held. However, legislation included a provision allowing the US President to assign individual tracts to individual owners. In 1860, thirty years after the creation of the Reservation, the government moved to allot tracts to individual households, in an effort to force assimilation to European-American practices. This {{was the first time in}} the history of American acts and treaties that American Indians were allotted land in <b>severalty.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Dawes Act of 1887, which allotted tribal {{lands in}} <b>severalty</b> to {{individual}}s, {{was seen as}} a way to create individual homesteads for Native Americans. Land allotments were made in exchange for Native Americans' becoming US citizens and giving up some forms of tribal self-government and institutions. It resulted in the transfer of an estimated total of 93 e6acre km2 from Native American control. Most was sold to individuals or given out free through the Homestead law, or given directly to Indians as individuals. The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 was also part of Americanization policy; it gave full citizenship to all Indians living on reservations. The leading opponent of forced assimilation was John Collier, who directed the federal Office of Indian Affairs from 1933 to 1945, and tried to reverse many of the established policies.|$|E
50|$|The {{town was}} founded in 1885 by Indian Postmaster Alexander McCredy as a {{railroad}} stop on the Northern Pacific Railroad as Simcoe, Washington. The Dawes <b>Severalty</b> Act of 1887 made it legal for the Yakama Indian Nation to sell their lands, and began to draw settlers into the area. With {{the construction of the}} Irwin Canal in 1896, agriculture became the big business in town. In the early 1900s, McCredy and George Rankin established the Wapato Development Company and laid out the town site. They established the town's first bank and began selling lots. In response to persistent confusion with nearby Fort Simcoe, the town changed its name to Wapato in 1903. The 1906 Jones Act further encouraged Anglos to purchase land from the Yakamas. Wapato was officially incorporated on September 16, 1908 with a population of around 300 people.|$|E
5000|$|In a 1997 {{article in}} Current Anthropology, Duran Bell {{describes}} marriage as [...] "a relationship between {{one or more}} men (male or female) in <b>severalty</b> {{to one or more}} women that provides those men with a demand-right of sexual access within a domestic group and identifies women who bear the obligation of yielding to the demands of those specific men." [...] In referring to [...] "men in severalty", Bell is referring to corporate kin groups such as lineages which, in having paid brideprice, retain a right in a woman's offspring even if her husband (a lineage member) deceases (Levirate marriage).
