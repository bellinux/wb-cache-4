25|$|On December 7, 1929, {{the lovers}} {{returned}} to New York where Josephine <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> return to Boston and her husband. Crosby's friend Hart Crane threw {{a party that}} evening to celebrate his completion {{after seven years of}} his poem, The Bridge. The Black Sun Press was scheduled to publish it the next week, and he wanted to bid Crosby and Caresse bon voyage, since they were due to sail back to France the next week. Among the guests present were Margaret Robson, Malcolm Cowley, Walker Evans, E. E. Cummings, and William Carlos Williams. The party went on until nearly dawn. Crosby and Caresse made plans to see Crane again before they left for Europe on December 10 to attend the popular Broadway play Berkeley Square.|$|E
500|$|In 1961, Holt married bank manager Gilbert LaPiere, who adopted Cher (under {{the name}} Cheryl LaPiere) and Georganne, and {{enrolled}} them at Montclair College Preparatory School, {{a private school}} in Encino, whose students were mostly from affluent families. The school's upper-class environment presented a challenge for Cher; biographer Connie Berman wrote, [...] " [...] stood out from the others in both her striking appearance and outgoing personality." [...] A former classmate commented, [...] "I'll never forget seeing Cher for the first time. She was so special... She was like a movie star, right then and there... She <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a movie star and we knew she would." [...] Despite not being an excellent student, Cher was intelligent and creative, according to Berman. She earned high grades, excelling in French and English classes. As an adult, she discovered that she had dyslexia. Cher achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior: she performed songs for students during the lunch hours and surprised peers when she wore a midriff-baring top. She later recalled, [...] "I was never really in school. I was always thinking about when I was grown up and famous." ...|$|E
2500|$|... etc. She <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be the [...] "Wicked Witch of the West" [...] in [...] "What Can I Wear For Halloween" [...] but {{she went}} as a girly rabbit instead of a witch. She had purple-rimmed-glasses with orange flowers on it on [...] "I Really Absolutely Must Have Glasses" [...] Sometimes she is seen with Evie.|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{you sure}} <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> home?" [...] <b>said</b> Mrs. Banks’s brother-in-law, in an awful voice, {{as the old}} lady sank back in her chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Into a convent!" [...] Newman {{repeated}} the words with the deepest dismay; it <b>was</b> as if <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> into an hospital. [...] "Into a convent--YOU!" ...|$|R
6000|$|All {{the evening}} Melbury {{had been coming}} to his door, saying, [...] "I wonder {{where in the world}} that girl is! Never in all my born days did I know her bide out like this! <b>She</b> surely <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> into the garden to get some parsley." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2003, {{after the}} police {{investigation}} concluded, Lieberman filed a court petition in New York County Surrogate's Court, which handles probate matters, {{to have his}} wife declared {{a victim of the}} attacks regardless of what the police had said. New York state law requires [...] "clear and convincing" [...] evidence of a possible victim's exposure to any lethal peril in order for any presumption of death and subsequent legal provisions, including benefits from the federal September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, to apply. He believed that his wife's profession would have led her to rush to the nearby World Trade Center, if she was in the vicinity, and offer aid to victims. Her mother further testified to their online chat, in which she <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> check out Windows on the World and possibly do some shopping at the Trade Center's mall. The author of the police report testified that he believed Philip probably died in the attacks.|$|E
60|$|She did not answer, and {{presently}} {{she got up}} and <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bed. She gave a timid little smile.|$|E
60|$|After dinner Mrs. Yoop {{took a big}} fiddle from a big {{cupboard}} {{and played}} such loud and dreadful music that her prisoners were all thankful when at last she stopped and <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bed.|$|E
50|$|She {{had worked}} for a dairyman named Bridger and lived in Lavender Hill. She shared {{accommodation}} with another dairy employee, Emma Hone, who had last seen her at 7pm {{the day of her}} death when <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> for a walk and wouldn't be long. Emma didn't know of any boyfriends of Mary.|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{policeman}} {{came here}} last night and <b>said</b> so. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to turn against the thieves, and tell all that she knows. Nasty, mean creature." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{that book}} {{which she and}} her simple old friend had read so much together, she had seen and taken to her young heart the image of one who loved the little child; and, as she gazed and mused, He had ceased to be an image {{and a picture of}} the distant past, and come to be a living, all-surrounding reality. His love enfolded her childish heart with more than mortal tenderness; and it <b>was</b> to Him, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going,</b> and to his home.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{birds that}} {{happened}} to be hanging round. And the scenery, and {{all that sort of}} thing. And she <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> London, and asked me to look her up if I was ever there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She was at {{her usual}} place at the top {{roulette}} table, but she gave it up just as I passed, <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> walk about," [...] the young man replied. [...] "I don't think she has left yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She doesn't {{know any}} more about art," [...] said Alma, [...] "than--nothing at all. But she's jolly and good-hearted. She praised {{everything}} that was bad in my sketches, and <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take lessons herself. When a person talks about taking lessons, {{as if they could}} learn it, you know where they belong artistically." ...|$|E
25|$|Inayat Khan insisted adamantly {{that she}} wanted to go and was {{competent}} for the work. Her only concern, <b>she</b> <b>said,</b> <b>was</b> her family, and Vera sensed immediately that this <b>was,</b> as <b>she</b> had suspected, where the problem lay. Inayat Khan had found saying goodbye to her widowed mother the most painful thing she had ever had to do, <b>she</b> <b>said.</b> As Vera had advised her, she had told her mother only half the truth: <b>she</b> had <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> abroad, but to Africa, and she had found maintaining the deception cruel.|$|R
50|$|Jin-soo {{put on her}} husband's coat, {{and asked}} him to dine with her for lunch that day. Her husband refuted and decided to hold it on another day. Jin-soo {{arranged}} it at his company, and <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> would <b>be</b> <b>going</b> for a holiday. Jin-soo offered to shorten the holiday after he <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> only <b>going</b> on a holiday.|$|R
6000|$|... "As to that, II believe I cannot say," [...] <b>said</b> <b>she,</b> and <b>was</b> <b>going</b> on, but stopped. Then she added, {{almost as}} if <b>she</b> <b>were</b> saying it to herself, [...] "Still, it was an {{improvement}} on yours!" ...|$|R
60|$|Aunt Jennie felt {{a little}} worried--as much as she could feel worried over anything--and she tried her best to dissuade Kate, {{although}} she plainly {{did not have much}} hope of doing so, having had enough experience with her determined daughter to realize that when Kate <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do a thing she did it. It was rather funny to listen to the ensuing dialogue.|$|E
60|$|In {{order to}} this, Amy gave her good words, and {{concealed}} her resentment {{as much as}} she could; and when she talked of going to her lodging, Amy smiled and said nothing, but called for a pair of oars to go to Greenwich; and asked her, seeing she <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> her lodging, to go along with her, for she was going home, and was all alone.|$|E
6000|$|... "She's gone away, sir, and we don't know where. She <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Snowfield o' Friday was a fortnight, and I went last Sunday {{to fetch}} her back; but she'd never been there, {{and she took}} the coach to Stoniton, and beyond that I can't trace her. But now I'm going a long journey to look for her, and I can't trust t' anybody but you where I'm going." ...|$|E
2500|$|It also {{confused}} Leslie Titmuss in John Mortimer's novel [...] "Titmus Regained"; when {{a friend}} <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to see [...] "Un Ballo in Maschera" [...] at Covent Garden, he replied [...] "never been one for dancing".|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> {{suddenly}} <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> away somewhere: <b>she</b> {{would not}} say where. She cashed all the money she could: a hundred-and-twenty-five pounds. She took the train to Cheshire, to the last address of the Natcha-Kee-Tawaras: she followed them to Stockport: and back to Chinley: and there <b>she</b> <b>was</b> stuck for the night. Next day she dashed back almost to Woodhouse, and swerved round to Sheffield. There, in that black town, thank heaven, she saw their announcement on the wall. She took a taxi to their theatre, {{and then on to}} their lodgings. The first thing <b>she</b> saw <b>was</b> Louis, in his shirt sleeves, on the landing above.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I see her now and then. Only {{the other}} day I met her in a store. Daren, she's getting some sense. She has a better {{position}} now. And <b>she</b> <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not <b>going</b> with any fellow but Harry." ...|$|R
60|$|After breakfast {{there came}} to Lawrence the {{opportunity}} of a private conference with Mrs Null. He was standing alone on the porch {{when she came out}} of the door with her hat on and a basket in her hand, and <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> see a very old colored woman who lived in the neighborhood, who was considered a very interesting personage; and perhaps he would like to go there with her. Nothing could suit Croft better than this, and off they started.|$|E
60|$|One evening, when Rollo {{had been}} making a long {{excursion}} during the day with his uncle George, and had dined with him, {{at the close of}} it, at a restaurant's in the Boulevards, he went home about eight o'clock to the hotel to see his father and mother and Jennie, and tell them where he had been. He found his mother in her room putting on her bonnet. She <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take a ride along the Boulevards with a gentleman and lady who were going to call for her.|$|E
6000|$|... "She is, upon my honour. Last night I {{know she}} was at ever so many places. She dined at the Bloxams', for I was there. Then she <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sit with old Mrs. Crackthorpe, who has broke her {{collar-bone}} (that Crackthorpe in the Life Guards, her grandson, is a brute, and I hope she won't leave him a shillin'); and then she came on to Lady Hawkstone's, where I heard her say she had been at the--at the Flowerdales', too. People begin to go to those Flowerdales'. Hanged--if I know where they won't go next. Cotton-spinner, wasn't he?" ...|$|E
50|$|While on the show, <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> would <b>be</b> <b>going</b> {{to medical}} school {{if she did not}} win the competition.|$|R
25|$|In an {{interview}} in Kazan <b>she</b> <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to start studying international relations at Beijing University in September. <b>She</b> <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> glad China was moving away from its one-child policy, {{she would have liked}} to have had a brother or sister, and she knew of women who had been forced to have abortions.|$|R
60|$|Upon this, Mrs. Ellison <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to {{give her}} a good scolding for her nonsense, and pulled her down and kissed her, and <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> had not done anything, and was, nevertheless, consoled at her resolve to expiate her offence by {{respecting}} thenceforward Mr. Arbuton's foibles and prejudices.|$|R
6000|$|P.S.--You know I mean Mornie all the time. It's she I'm {{going to}} seek; but don't {{you think so}} bad of her as you do, I am so much worse than she. I {{wanted to tell you}} that all along, but I didn't dare. She's run away from the Ferry half crazy; <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Sacramento, and I am going there to find her alive or dead. Forgive me, brother! Don't throw this down right away; hold it in your hand a moment, Randy, boy, and try hard to think it's my hand in yours. And so good-by, and God bless you, old Randy! ...|$|E
60|$|One {{morning in}} the middle of the week after this {{incident}} the innocent author of it presented herself in Hilary's study, and, standing in her peculiar patient attitude, made her little statements. As usual, they were very little ones; as usual, she seemed helpless, and suggested a child with a sore finger. She had no other work; she owed the week's rent; she did not know what would happen to her; Mrs. Dallison did not want her any more; she could not tell what she had done! The picture was finished, she knew, but Mrs. Dallison had <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> paint her again in another picture....|$|E
60|$|Every {{one noticed}} {{the change in}} Miss Helstone's appearance, and most people <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> die. She never thought so herself. She felt in no dying case; she had neither pain nor sickness. Her {{appetite}} was diminished; she knew the reason. It was because she wept so much at night. Her strength was lessened; she could account for it. Sleep was coy and hard to be won; dreams were distressing and baleful. In the far future she still seemed to anticipate a time when this passage of misery should be got over, and when she should once more be calm, though perhaps never again happy.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't say any more, Mr. Jolliffe, don't!' <b>said</b> <b>she,</b> choking. 'You <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to marry}} Joanna next month, {{and it is}} wrong to--to--' ...|$|R
6000|$|When Bartley's article came out, {{she read}} {{it with a}} fond admiration which all her praises seemed to leave unsaid. She bought a scrap-book, and pasted the article into it, and <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to keep {{everything}} he wrote. [...] "What <b>are</b> you <b>going</b> to write the next thing?" [...] she asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and <b>said</b> that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> away and--on Christmas Eve we met {{there in}} the Dead Church. Then somehow--for I had no {{intention}} of such a thing--all the truth came out, and I found that I was no longer master of myself, and--God forgive me! and you, Mary, forgive me, too--that I loved her also." ...|$|R
