5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Richard Appel, {{but the idea of}} Bart and Lisa {{attending}} a military academy had previously been pitched, and had been floating around since 1991. The idea had not yet been used as an episode plot, because the writers had not felt comfortable with taking Bart and Lisa to a <b>strange</b> <b>place</b> early in the series.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} a heroine {{moving to a}} <b>strange</b> <b>place</b> where {{she does not know}} the local {{language}} is replicated in Ratnam's later films, Roja (1992) and Bombay (1995). The heroine has a dilemma; because she does not know the language in Delhi she can barely socialise with local people, and she is at loggerheads with the only person with whom she can relate. According to Rangan, the restaurant scene with Manohar and Divya is the first instance in Tamil cinema where a man invites a woman for a cup of coffee. He compared it to Oru Thalai Ragam (1980), in which the protagonists barely spoke. Ratnam said that he was inspired by the Doors and the Beatles and, although it was not uncommon to invite a woman for a cup of coffee, it was not reflected in the Tamil cinema of the time.|$|E

This was the second instance where {{a member of the}} production crew wrote an episode, the first being Mat Beck's [...] "Wetwired".

Goodwin {{came up with the idea}} of having Fox Mulder waking up in a <b>strange</b> <b>place</b> with no idea how he got there. After receiving approval from series creator Chris Carter, Goodwin spent approximately six weeks writing the episode.|$|E

The song was performed {{with the aid of a}} gilded subway car and a [...] "disco stick" [...] while her next number [...] "Boys Boys Boys" [...] featured muscly male dancers cavorting in spandex shorts. After a costume change, Gaga burst into [...] "Money Honey" [...] with an extended keytar solo after emerging from beneath the stage as the New York scenery disappeared around her. As she walked towards the Glitter way, Gaga recalls when she was in jail and her friend Beyoncé bailed her out, thus performing the song [...] "Telephone". A piano is then brought in and Gaga goes into the song [...] "Brown Eyes", after which she performs [...] "Speechless". This segment also saw the performance of [...] "You and I" [...] in some of the shows; the song was later added to Gaga's second studio album, Born This Way. During this song, she tells the audience about her life as a teen in New York, and how she became who she is today. Gaga and her friends then continue down the Glitter Way, and soon they run into an angel, who plays a tune that summons a twister, taking them closer to the Monster Ball, but landing them in a <b>strange</b> <b>place</b> that they did not know. Gaga sings [...] "So Happy I Could Die", decked in a white dress, that moves on its own accord.|$|E

We were both acting like we were engaged in conversations with people that we don't even know. It was just miserable.
