5000|$|The verb be has {{multiple}} irregular forms. In the present indicative it has {{am in the}} first person singular, is in the third person singular, and are in the plural and second person singular. (Its present subjunctive is be, as in [...] "I <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> extremely careful.") It also has two past tense forms: was for the first and third persons singular, and were for the plural and second person singular (although there are certain subjunctive uses in which were can substitute for was). The past participle is been, and the present participle and gerund forms are regular: being. For more details see Indo-European copula.|$|E

For The Bribe {{is the sort of}} temptation which Hollywood put in the way of gullible moviegoers about twenty years ago. Its a piece of pure romantic fiction, as lurid as it is absurd. And if it didnt have several big names in it, it would be low-man on a grind house triple-bill...The only hint which the director, Robert Z. Leonard, gives that he may have meant it all as pure nonsense comes at the very end, when he blows up the place with pyrotechnics. Thats the one appropriate move in the whole show." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1921, Terry-Thomas {{began to}} nurture his distinctive, well-spoken voice, {{reasoning}} that [...] "using good speech automatically <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> well-educated and made people {{look up to}} you". He used the speech of the actor Owen Nares {{as a basis for}} his own delivery. Terry-Thomas became fascinated by the stage, and regularly attended the Golders Green Hippodrome to see the latest shows. It was there that he developed an interest in fashion, and adopted the debonair dress-sense of his hero Douglas Fairbanks. Terry-Thomas attended Fernbank School in Hendon Lane, Finchley, which was a welcome escape from the stresses of his parents' break-up. When he was 13, he transferred to Ardingly College, a public school in Sussex. He excelled in Latin and geography, and briefly took up drama. The latter subject later led to his expulsion from the school, after his frequent and inappropriate use of ad lib during lessons. He also took up a position in the school jazz band, first playing the ukulele and then percussion and additionally he often performed comedy dancing routines to the band's music.|$|R

5000|$|The {{best way}} to reserve anti-Semitism as a term of {{condemnation}} is to define it as hatred of Jews, not {{for what they do}} but for what they are. It is to hate them just because they belong to a certain ethnic group. Foxman <b>is</b> right to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can <b>be</b> an anti-Semite without expressing any racist sentiments: Many anti-Semites confine themselves to expounding false claims about Jewish control. But you can also, without harboring anti-Semitic hate, criticize Israel and even the Jewish community for its failures.' ...|$|R

40|$|Hedgehog {{signaling}} {{is required}} for many aspects of development in vertebrates and invertebrates. Misregulation of the Hedgehog pathway causes developmental abnormalities and has been implicated in certain types of cancer. Large-scale genetic screens in zebrafish have identified a group of mutations, termed you- class mutations, that share common defects in somite shape {{and in most cases}} disrupt Hedgehog signaling. These mutant embryos exhibit U-shaped somites characteristic of defects in slow muscle development. In addition, Hedgehog pathway mutations disrupt spinal cord patterning. We report the positional cloning of you, one of the original you -class mutations, and show that it {{is required for}} Hedgehog signaling in the development of slow muscle and in the specification of ventral fates in the spinal cord. The you gene encodes a novel protein with conserved EGF and CUB domains and a secretory pathway signal sequence. Epistasis experiments support an extracellular role for You upstream of the Hedgehog response mechanism. Analysis of chimeras indicates <b>that</b> <b>you</b> mutant cells can appropriately respond to Hedgehog signaling in a wild-type environment. Additional chimera analysis indicates <b>that</b> wild-type <b>you</b> gene function <b>is</b> not required in axial Hedgehog-producing cells, <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> <b>You</b> <b>is</b> essential for transport or stability of Hedgehog signals in the extracellular environment. Our positional cloning and functional studies demonstrate <b>that</b> <b>You</b> <b>is</b> a novel extracellular component of the Hedgehog pathway in vertebrates. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{bachelor}} dissertation Thin {{at every}} cost? is a discourse analysis {{of how the}} human body is portrayed in the two Swedish evening tabloid newspapers Aftonbladet and Expressen. The study aims to investigate how the ideal body is portrayed, which qualities that we associate with the ideal body and also where the focal point is.   The investigation has been conducted by the implementation of Ernesto Laclau’s and Chantal Mouffe’s discourse analysis as both a theoretical framework and analysis tool, and uses agenda-setting theory, consumerist culture and weight, health and body ideal research to form a scientific base for the analysis.   The result of the study shows that the ideal body is thin. To achieve a thin body you must exercise and diet, because being in possession of an overweight body <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> lazy and lack self-control. To promote a thin body most of the researched articles uses health as a concept. To achieve a thin body you must therefore “consume” health. Body image has become a marketing tool and something to buy and sell. If you consume body image and/or health, you will often find yourself being drawn back into the “void”, because the diets and exercises that the articles use to promote weight-loss are often short-term and therefore make you as a reader have to return for another diet, i. e. you have to consume more. The articles often use a big element of control to promote the thin body, {{but at the same time}} try to use a positive language to set the tone of the article. Body shaming also occurred, and articles that dealt with the negative aspects of weight loss were also researched and reinforced that the overweight body is often a subject of course language and judgement. ...|$|R

In April 2010, Solum republished the same article as an online draft, in which he clarified his original statement so {{that it would not be}} misunderstood as excluding the children of one citizen parent. In a footnote he explained, [...] "based on my reading of the historical sources, there is no credible case that a person born on American soil with one American parent was clearly not a 'natural born citizen'." [...] He further extended natural born citizenship to all cases of jus soli as the [...] "conventional view". Although Solum stated elsewhere that the two-citizen-parents arguments were not [...] "crazy", he believes [...] "the much stronger argument <b>suggests</b> <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> <b>were</b> born on American soil <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would <b>be</b> considered a natural born citizen." ...|$|R

50|$|Eleven {{years had}} passed by since Ananda Mohan joined Vyasashram. To reach the goal of {{ultimate}} aspiration, he felt that his entry into Sannyas stage (Hermitage) was an absolute necessity, and for total renunciation of worldly affairs. All the stipulations of the Malayalaswami to grant sannyas had already been satisfied by Ananda Mohan. On 29 June 1947, {{it was decided to}} perform consecration rites of Sannyasa on Ananda Mohan as per five-day tradition at the ashram. All arrangements were made to grant the deeksha as per Vedic rights, Knowing this many well known people, sadhus from many parts arrived at the ashram. As per Giri tradition (Dashanami Sampradaya and Kriya Yoga), Malayalaswami gave Ananda Mohan his new name Swāmī Vidyāprakāśānanda Giri, and thus conferred on him all the rights to teach and preach advaita philosophy, and on the name, Malayalaswami <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> since <b>you</b> <b>are</b> to propagate earnestly Vedic knowledge, to remind you constantly of my intentions, I propose you this new name.Thus Ananda Mohan had transformed himself to Swāmī Vidyā Prakāśānanda Giri, his fame has spread many areas and was respected as he was an expert in practising what he preaches.|$|R

Dread Central gave the film a positive review, writing, [...] "Octaman I recommend strictly for fans of old school monster movies and cult cinema, as well as bad movie aficionados, and even then there’s a part of me <b>that</b> <b>suggests</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> prepared to fast forward when things get bogged down with dry, talky dialogue and a needlessly long cave searching scene that only results in the characters ending up pretty much back where they started".|$|R

5000|$|Film critic Janet Maslin {{discussed}} {{the music in}} the film and wrote, [...] "Music is {{a major part of}} Baby, It's You, as the title may indicate. The score consists of rock songs that more or less correspond to the time, although Sheik's entrances are accompanied by Bruce Springsteen songs; these may be anachronistic, but they suit Sheik to a T.
