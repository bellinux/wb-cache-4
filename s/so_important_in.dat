5|$|The {{small size}} of the airport is perhaps best {{illustrated}} {{with the fact that}} a Boeing 757 cannot taxi past another aircraft to parking positions. As a result, controllers are responsible not only for ensuring that valuable space is utilised, but also ensuring that other aircraft are kept circling until larger aircraft are parked. Despite these limitations, the airport successfully handles ten to twenty times more traffic than airports of a comparable size. It {{is for this reason that}} plans to relocate the airport are <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> the short-term scale. In 2006, a NIS 5.5 million renovation programme of Eilat Airport's terminal and runway was undertaken, designed to sustain the airport until it is replaced in the near future.|$|E

The most common uses are with traditional dances, which are a form of theater, with characters, storyline and music, but the performers are not professionals. The purpose of the masks it convert participants into other beings or characters. This element is <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> many events that if a dancer does not use a mask, he often wears dark glasses to indicate that he is not his normal self. A double sense of masking is to use dark glasses over a mask. With few exceptions, dances are performed by males, who play female roles wearing masks. The reason for this is that it was not considered proper for women in Europe to act or dance, a prohibition brought to Mexico by the Spanish. One important character of this type is La Malinche, in dances about the Conquest.|$|E

500|$|Massengale argues that, {{given that}} music is <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> the Epistles, and that Bellman had more than enough musical skill to write a tune, it is {{remarkable}} that all or almost all the tunes are borrowed. He suggests that this [...] "seems to indicate that Bellman wanted to preserve some vestige of the borrowing." [...] That the borrowing was not just about saving effort or making up for absent skill, Massengale argues, is demonstrated {{by the fact that the}} amount of work Bellman had to put into the melodies for Epistles 12 ("Gråt Fader Berg och spela") and 24 ("Kära Syster!") was [...] "surely tantamount to the production of new melodies." [...] Borrowing was accepted, even encouraged at the time, but that does not explain why Bellman would have done it so consistently. The [...] "poetic possibility", Massengale suggests, is that Bellman wished to exploit the humorous contrast between a melody of one type and a story of another, or between an existing image associated with the melody, and a fresh one presented in an Epistle. In addition, Bellman was able to use what his audience knew to be borrowed music to reinforce the historical flavour of the Epistles, introducing exactly the kind of ambiguity that he was seeking.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{theme of}} class has {{attracted}} much scholarly attention. Carole Dole noted that class constitutes {{an important element}} in Austen's stories and is [...] "impossible" [...] to avoid when adapting her novels. According to Dole, Lee's film contains an [...] "ambiguous treatment of class values" [...] that stresses social differences but [...] "underplays the consequences of the class distinctions <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> the novel"; for instance, Edward's story ends upon his proposal to Elinor, with no attention paid to how they will live on his small annual income from the vicarage. Louise Flavin believed that Lee used the houses to represent their occupants' class and character: the Dashwood sisters' decline in eligibility are represented through the contrast between the spacious rooms of Norland Park and those of the isolated, cramped Barton Cottage. James Thompson criticised what he described as the anaesthetised [...] "mélange of disconnected picture postcard-gift-calendar-perfect scenes," [...] in which little connection is made between [...] "individual subjects and the land that supports them." [...] Andrew Higson argued that while Sense and Sensibility includes commentary on sex and gender, it fails to pursue issues of class. Thompson's script, he wrote, displays a [...] "sense of impoverishment [...] confined to the still privileged lifestyle of the disinherited Dashwoods. The broader class system is pretty much taken for granted." [...] The ending visual image of flying gold coins, depicted during Marianne's wedding, has also drawn attention; Marsha McCreadie noted that it serves as a [...] "visual wrap-up and emblem of the merger between money and marriage." ...|$|E

In an exclusive with Rap-Up, when asked about how the connection came about, Mandler said, [...] "I’m {{a big fan of}} Drake and I was really excited when he called me about doing it, and really put a lot into making it special and capturing what I think is an image he hasn’t had yet. Here’s a guy whose lyrical presence does not equal his visual presence yet, by any means. That’s something that he and I spoke a lot about. He felt strongly that nobody had really captured him, and some of the videos that had been done were less iconic than he would like to be represented as." [...] On Drake and the song he said, [...] "It’s so refreshing that he’s confident, but he’s not arrogant. I think that dimensionality is <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> a genre that is very one note with words like “bravado” and “swagger” and “arrogance” and “promiscuity.” Here’s a guy that’s finally putting a duality to the words and saying, “Yeah, I have all that and I do all that, but I’m also somebody that’s asking, is that what I should be doing with my life?" [...] When asked of the concept of the [...] "Over" [...] video, Mandler said that it was something that would not be expected. Mandler explained, [...] "Drake and I were very conscious about trying to push the limits and trying to push things forward. He came to me because he wanted to throw away the conventions of a medium, and take chances and be daring and take certain themes that are relevant to him and try to visualize them in not the obvious way".|$|E
500|$|... "Redux" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Todd VanDerWerff, writing for The A.V. Club, awarded {{the first episode}} a C+ rating and wrote that [...] "'Redux ' {{was a pretty good}} episode back in 1997. It’s not a very good episode now". VanDerWerff noted that the idea that Mulder had killed himself was not effective because the show's audience knew that a movie had been scheduled for release in the summer of 1998. Finally, he called the episode's ending [...] "one of the show’s weaker cliffhangers". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave {{the first part of the}} episode a negative review and awarded it one star out of four. She heavily criticized the story's pacing, noting that the episode [...] "is all plot, plot, plot. [...] much of the plot is unbelievable." [...] Furthermore, Vitaris criticized several plot holes in the episode, including Mulder's easy entrance into the Department of Defense and the characters antics, such as his attack of Ostelhoff. However, despite the overall negative review, Vitaris did mention that, [...] "There's only one truly galvanizing scene, as that's the confrontation between Scully and Skinner after he follows her to the lab where she is performing her DNA test." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two heavily criticized the [...] "Skinner-as-traitor" [...] plot, noting sardonically that [...] "the production team aren't going to do , and the shock 'villain in the room' reveal will be Section Chief Blevins–a character <b>so</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> the framework of the series that, barring his appearance in the Season Four finale, we haven't seen him in ninety-four episodes." [...] Not all reviews were so negative. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files named [...] "Redux" [...] and [...] "Redux II", together, as the tenth best [...] "Episode of All Time". In his critique of [...] "Redux", he noted [...] "While many people don't care for 'Redux', I think it does a good job of preparing us for the second hour (although, it invalidates Gillian's emotional context from the S4 finale)." [...] In the 1999 FX Thanksgiving Marathon, containing fan-selected episodes, [...] "Redux" [...] (along with [...] "Gethsemane" [...] and [...] "Redux II") was presented as the [...] "Best Mythology Episode".|$|E
