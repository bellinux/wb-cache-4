40|$|Electrophoretic {{deposition}} (EPD) of aqueous alu-mina <b>slips</b> on <b>a</b> graphite <b>electrode</b> is studied. The suspension {{is characterized}} {{in terms of}} viscosity, zeta potential and conductivity. The conductivity {{has proved to be}} a determining parameter for obtaining deposits. Well-dispersed <b>slips</b> having <b>an</b> adequate value of conductivity are used for constant current density experiments. Current densities of I. 6 to 12. 8 mA cmm 2 are applied for IO min. After defining the optimal slip properties for the deposition, both the process development and the final properties of the materials obtained depend on the current/time rela-tionship. Alumina deposits obtained at diflerent cur-rent densities are characterized. The best conditions for obtaining &form and dense coatings are 6. 4 mA cmm 2 for up to 10 min. The applied current allows not only to modify the properties and microstruc-ture of the deposit, but also to increase the margin of slip conductivity assurmg the success of the EPD process, that is, the working conditions. 0 1997 Elsevier Science Limited.

40|$|For {{orientation}} purposes a brief {{review of}} the meaning of the potential of <b>an</b> <b>electrode,</b> first proposed by Lewis and adopted by most American physical chemists, is given. A definition of the potential of <b>an</b> <b>electrode,</b> basical ly dif-ferent from those of Lewis and of Gibbs, is developed {{on the basis of the}} thermodynamic analysis of conditions existing in <b>an</b> <b>electrode</b> system (half-cell) at equil ibrium.

The value of the electron chem-ical potential of <b>an</b> <b>electrode,</b> so defined, is shown (a) to be invariant in sign as is that of the Gibbs potential, and (b) to be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to that of the Gibbs potential.

Furthermore, the resulting AFL is principal if the original AFL is principal. It is then proved that the smallest AFL containing all homomorphic replications of the regular sets is not principal.
