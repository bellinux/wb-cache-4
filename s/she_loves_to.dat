Her office is a place where the impossible tends to happen, and anyone who enters is normally treated with a mixture of verbal abuse and psychological torture, so she can get back to doing nothing, or thinking about how to upset the next visitor. The only person she treats with any affection is Mac, whom <b>she</b> <b>loves</b> <b>to</b> the point of madness, but Mac, like almost everyone else, tries his best to avoid her.
