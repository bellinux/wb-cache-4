40|$|Two {{different}} types of cationic polysoaps together with their monomers were obtained. These species consist of divalent quaternary ammonium repeat units carrying a hydrocarbon or a fluorocarbon side chain, respectively. Dynamic surface tensions and <b>surface</b> dilatational <b>rheology</b> were measured by means of drop shape analysis of a sessile bubble, using specially developed hardware and software. <b>Surface</b> dilatational <b>rheology</b> {{was measured by the}} oscillating bubble method. Both the monomers and polymers show strong surface activity. The hydrocarbon monomer shows a maximum surface pressure of 44 mN/m and the fluorinated monomer of 55 mN/m. The polymers show lower surface pressures, 28 and 47 mN/m for the hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon polymers, respectively. The fluorinated polymer has peculiar adsorption characteristics, especially at low concentrations. All substances have very high surface dilatational elasticity, up to 180 mN/m for the fluorinated polymer, whilst the hydrocarbon substances give approximately half of this value. The specific surface areas are relatively high, and adsorption of all these substances is considerably slower than for ordinary surfactants, probably due to their particularly bulky head-group and charged nature. The monomers form micelles with CMCs of 0. 3 and of 3. 0 gL- 1 for the fluorinated and hydrocarbon monomer, respectively. With increasing bulk concentration, a maximum in surface elasticity is observed for the monomers, but this is decreasing to almost zero at high concentrations. Both this decrease and most of the frequency dependence of the modules are believed to be caused by molecular transport between the surface and the bulk. It is more pronounced for the monomers than for the polymers. Deviations from the transport theory are observed, and are believed to be caused by in-surface relaxation processes...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{membrane}} fluidity usually {{refers to a}} high molecular mobility inside the lipid bilayer which enables lateral diffusion of embedded proteins.

Biological membranes require both properties for their function: high lateral fluidity and structural rigidity. Consequently, an adequate account must include, in addition to viscosity, the possibility for a nonzero shear modulus. This knowledge is still lacking as measurements of membrane shear properties have remained incomplete so far.

50|$|The {{dynamics}} of surfactant adsorption {{is of great}} importance for practical applications such as in foaming, emulsifying or coating processes, where bubbles or drops are rapidly generated {{and need to be}} stabilized. The {{dynamics of}} adsorption depend on the diffusion coefficient of the surfactant. As the interface is created, the adsorption is limited by the diffusion of the surfactant to the interface. In some cases, there can exist an energetic barrier to adsorption or desorption of the surfactant. If such a barrier limits the adsorption rate, the dynamics are said to be ‘kinetically limited'. Such energy barriers can be due to steric or electrostatic repulsions.The <b>surface</b> <b>rheology</b> of surfactant layers, including the elasticity and viscosity of the layer, {{play an important role in}} the stability of foams and emulsions.|$|E

Furthermore, the materials that make up the container may chemically contaminate the liquids under study. The DPM uses acoustical (sound) waves to position a drop {{in the center of a}} chamber. By studying drops in this manner, scientists have the opportunity to test basic fluid physics theories in the areas of nonlinear dynamics, capillary waves, and <b>surface</b> <b>rheology</b> (changes in the form and flow of matter). Crew members, through manipulation of the sound waves, were able to rotate, oscillate, merge, and even split drops. In another test, the crew members were able to create the first compound drop, a drop within a drop, to investigate a process that could eventually be employed to encapsulate living cells within a semi-permeable membrane for use in medical transplantation treatments.|$|E
50|$|If {{the free}} {{surface of a}} liquid is disturbed, waves are {{produced}} on the surface. These waves are not elastic waves due to any elastic force; they are gravity waves caused {{by the force of}} gravity tending to bring the surface of the disturbed liquid back to its horizontal level. Momentum causes the wave to overshoot, thus oscillating and spreading the disturbance to the neighboring portions of the surface. The velocity of the surface waves varies as the square root of the wavelength if the liquid is deep; therefore long waves on the sea go faster than short ones. Very minute waves or ripples are not due to gravity but to capillary action, and have properties {{different from those of the}} longer ocean surface waves,because the surface is increased in area by the ripples and the capillary forces are in this case large compared with the gravitational forces.Capillary ripples are damped both by sub-surface viscosity and by <b>surface</b> <b>rheology.</b>|$|E

Currently used descriptions of <b>surface</b> <b>rheology</b> have a number of limitations, and in particular are hard to generalize to the large deformation regime. Data are often analyzed with constitutive equations based on straightforward generalizations of models developed for describing bulk phase rheology.

40|$|The gravity {{drainage}} of foam {{leads to the}} deformation of liquid film that results in the surface tension gradients and the heterogeneity of film thicknesses. The deformation of liquid films causes the rupture of films.

40|$|How {{subduction}} initiates with mechanically unfavorable lithospheric heterogeneities {{is important}} and rarely studied. We investigate this with a geodynamic model for the Puysegur Incipient Subduction Zone (PISZ) south of New Zealand. The model incorporates a true free <b>surface,</b> elasto-visco-plastic <b>rheology</b> and phase changes. Our predictions fit the morphology of the Puysegur Trench and Ridge and the deformation history on the overriding plate. We show how a new thrust fault forms and evolves into a smooth subduction interface, and how a preexisting weak zone can become a vertical fault inboard of the thrust fault during subduction initiation, consistent with two-fault system at PISZ. The model suggests that the PISZ may not yet be self-sustaining. We propose that the Snares Zone (or Snares Trough) is caused by plate coupling differences between shallower and deeper parts, the tectonic sliver between two faults experiences strong rotation, and low-density material accumulates beneath the Snares Zone...|$|R

Here we use mixtures of sodium dodecyl sulphate and dodecanol to produce different surface shear viscosities and to elucidate the role of intermolecular forces and <b>surface</b> <b>rheology</b> in foam film drainage. The thickness of plane parallel foam films with very small radius versus time was obtained with an improved Scheludko cell set-up {{used in conjunction with}} a high-speed video camera system operating at a frequency of 1000 frames per second. The surface tension and surface potential were measured by pendant bubble tensiometry and micro-electrophoresis, respectively. The surface shear viscosity was determined by a deep channel surface shear viscometer. The modelling considered surface tension gradient, surface shear viscosity and diffusion, and DLVO and non-DLVO intermolecular forces. Comparison between experimental data and theoretical models for foam film drainage shows that the film drainage is influenced by the Marangoni effect due to surface tension gradient, producing foam films with immobile interfaces. Intermolecular forces, in particular, non-DLVO hydrophobic attractive forces, have the most significant effect on the film drainage...|$|E

40|$|Foam and {{emulsion}} stability {{has long}} been believed to correlate with the surface shear viscosity of the surfactant used to stabilize them. Many subtleties arise in interpreting surface shear viscosity measurements, however, and correlations do not necessarily indicate causation. Using a sensitive technique designed to excite purely surface shear deformations, we make the most sensitive and precise measurements to date of the surface shear viscosity {{of a variety of}} soluble surfactants, focusing on SDS in particular. Our measurements reveal the surface shear viscosity of SDS to be below the sensitivity limit of our technique, giving an upper bound of order 0. 01 μN·s/m. This conflicts directly with almost all previous studies,which reported values up to 103 - 104 times higher. Multiple control and complementary measurements confirm this result, including direct visualization of monolayer deformation, for SDS and a wide variety of soluble polymeric, ionic, and nonionic surfactants of high- and low-foaming character.

By using microfluidic devices, we measured the deformability of various cancer cell lines by passing the cells through it.

We will limit ourselves to frameworks employing the Gibbs dividing surface model, and start with a general discussion of the surface excess variables, introduced in this model. We then discuss conservation principles for multiphase systems with excess mass, momentum, energy, and entropy associated with the dividing surfaces. The inclusion of surface excesses in the conservation principles leads {{to a set of}} time-evolution equations for these excesses: the jump balances. The jump momentum balance is a generalised form of the Young–Laplace equation, often used for analysing <b>surface</b> dilatational <b>rheology</b> experiments. We conclude this chapter with an overview of methods to derive (nonlinear) constitutive equations for the fluxes that appear in the jump balances. In particular, we will focus on surface constitutive modelling using classical irreversible thermodynamics (combined with internal variables theory), extended irreversible thermodynamics, and the General Equation for Non-Equilibrium Reversible–Irreversible Coupling (GENERIC) framework.

The properties and stability of the resulting emulsions were examined by means of droplet size distribution analysis, Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner modelling, bulk rheology, interfacial composition analysis, large-amplitude oscillatory <b>surface</b> dilatational <b>rheology,</b> electrokinetic analysis and fluorescence microscopy. Both pectin preparations were able to emulsify alkanes in water but exhibited distinct ageing characteristics. Emulsions prepared using pectin isolated at pH 6. 0 were remarkably stable with respect to droplet growth after thirty days of ageing, while those prepared with pectin isolated at pH 2. 0 destabilised rapidly. Examination of chemical composition of interfacial layers indicated multi-layered adsorption of pectins at the oil-water interface. The higher long-term stability of emulsions prepared with pectin isolated at high pH is attributed to mechanically stronger interfaces, the highly branched nature and the low hydrodynamic volume of the chains that result in effective steric stabilisation whereas acetyl and methyl contents do not contribute to the long-term stability. The present work shows that it is possible by tailoring the fine structure of pectin to engineer emulsions that operate in acidic environments...|$|R

These properties affect the dynamics of emulsions, of dispersions of vesicles, of biological fluids, of coatings, of free surface flows, of immiscible polymer blends, and of many other complex systems. The study of interfacial {{dynamic properties}}, <b>surface</b> <b>rheology,</b> is therefore a relevant discipline for many branches of physics, chemistry, engineering, and life sciences. In the past three to four decades a vast amount of literature has been produced dealing with the rheological properties of interfaces stabilized by low molecular weight surfactants, proteins, (bio) polymers, lipids, colloidal particles, and various mixtures of these surface active components. In this paper recent experiments are reviewed in the field of <b>surface</b> <b>rheology,</b> with particular emphasis on the models used to analyze surface rheological data. Most of the models currently used are straightforward generalizations of models developed for the analysis of rheological data of bulk phases. In general the limits on the validity of these generalizations are not discussed. Not much use is being made of recent advances in nonequilibrium thermodynamic formalisms for multiphase systems, to construct admissible models for the stress-deformation behavior of interfaces. These formalisms are ideally suited to construct thermodynamically admissible constitutive equations for rheological behavior that include the often relevant couplings to other fluxes in the interface (heat and mass), and couplings to the transfer of mass from the bulk phase to the interface. In this review recent advances in the application of classical irreversible thermodynamics, extended irreversible thermodynamics, rational thermodynamics, extended rational thermodynamics, and the general equation for the nonequilibrium reversible-irreversible coupling formalism to multiphase systems are also discussed, and shown how these formalisms can be used to generate a wide range of thermodynamically admissible constitutive models for the surface stress tensor.

40|$|Dynamic {{adsorption}} {{and tension}} behavior of surfactants at air/liquid interfaces {{is important in}} foaming, coating flows for thin film production, wetting, and other processes. A bubble surfactometer {{has been used to}} study the adsorption dynamics of several nonionic and ionic surfactants under both constant-area and pulsating-area conditions. A new model, which considers the enhancement or activation energy barrier of adsorption/desorption, is applied to octanol, sodium dodecylsulfate, and some novel surfactants used in wool-dyeing applications. The results indicate strong effects of molecular interactions, such as electrostatic repulsion, between interfacial monolayer and adsorbing molecules. ^ As the interface area oscillates sinusoidally, the dynamic tensions fluctuate and their amplitudes vary with the oscillation frequency. The tension amplitudes are related to the exchange rates of molecules to and from the interface. The nonequilibrium tensions can be substantially lower than the equilibrium tensions. This phenomenon was observed quite generally for surfactants and proteins studied. The low nonequilibrium tensions can be accounted for by an adsorption hysteresis mechanism that is predicted by a newly developed convective mass transfer model, without need to consider <b>surface</b> dilatational <b>rheology</b> effects. Models have been extended to help in understanding dynamic competitive adsorption of mixed surfactants at interfaces. Data and models reveal several interesting mixture phenomena, having implications for foam-based separations from dilute solutions and for lung surfactants used for the treatment of the respiratory distress syndrome. ...|$|R

The {{effect of the}} changes in the structure on the surface properties of the protein was also measured. As the pH was decreased from pH 7 toward pH 2, at which alpha-lactalbumin adopts a molten globule state, a small but increasing proportion of the molecules in the sample partially unfold. There was on average a loss of tertiary structure and a change in the environment of the tryptophan residues. A significant proportion of the change measured by both circular dichroism spectroscopy and interfacial methods observed as the pH was decreased from pH 7 to pH 4 was found to be irreversible upon readjustment back to pH 7. These changes in the sample conferred an increase in surface hydrophobicity and affected the surface properties. The surface activity was found to be highest at pH 4. This was because the increasing flexibility and surface hydrophobicity of the molecule with decreasing pH was balanced by the simultaneous increase in net charge repulsion. This conclusion was also confirmed by measurements of <b>surface</b> shear <b>rheology.</b> Interestingly the interfacial dilatational rheology was highest at the isoelectric point, indicating the dominant role of the charge interaction in controlling this parameter...|$|R
