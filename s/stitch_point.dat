40|$|To {{achieve a}} {{three-dimensional}} form of clothing a sophisticated joining {{of pieces of}} fabrics is required. Different lengths and contours have to be fit. A planning system has been realised to achieve the geometrical adaptation {{with respect to the}} different material properties of fabrics. Today, only a highly skilled seamstress can operate sewing machines to fulfil these requirements. This paper presents an approach for flexible automation of sewing processes. The distribution of <b>stitching</b> <b>points</b> for planning the seam paths of the pieces to be sewn are calculated based experimentally investigated fabric properties.

In this article, a mathematic model based on a software program has been developed to automatically generate a double fabric stitched by additional warp called center warp. Each layer has been represented in a 2 D binary matrix, and a new matrix called warps order matrix has been defined to demonstrate the modality of position of the center warps in relating {{to the top and}} bottom fabrics’ warps.

40|$|Given two motion-capture {{sequences}} {{that are}} to be stitched together, how can we assess the goodness of the stitching? The straightforward solution, Euclidean distance, permits counter-intuitive results because it ignores the effort required to actually make the stitch. The main contribution of our work is that we propose an intuitive, first-principles approach, by computing the effort that is needed to do the transition (laziness-effort, or ’L-score’). Our conjecture is that, the smaller the effort, the more natural the transition will seem to humans. Moreover, we propose the elastic L-score which allows for elongated stitching, to make a transition as natural as possible. We present preliminary experiments on both artificial and real motions which show that our L-score approach indeed agrees with human intuition, it chooses good <b>stitching</b> <b>points,</b> and generates natural transition paths...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel method for {{automatically}} and efficiently generating stereoscopic mosaics by seamless registration of optical data collected by a video camera mounted on an airborne platform that undergoes dominant translational motion. There are four critical points discussed in this paper: 1) Using a parallel-perspective representation, a pair of geometrically registered stereo mosaics can be constructed before we explicitly recover any 3 D information under rather general motion. 2) A PRISM (parallel ray interpolation for stereo mosaicing) technique is proposed to make stereo mosaics seamless {{in the presence of}} motion parallax and for rather arbitrary scenes. A fast PRISM algorithm is presented and issues on <b>stitching</b> <b>point</b> selection and occlusion handling are discussed. 3) The epipolar geometry of parallel-perspective stereo mosaics generated under constrained 6 DOF motion is formulated, which shows optimal baselines, easy search for correspondence and constant depth resolution. 4) The proposed methods for the generation of stereo mosaics and then the reconstruction of a 3 D map are efficient in both computation and storage.

40|$|Swept Frequency Source Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) {{requires}} high {{repetition rate}} and wide spectral width wavelength tunable sources {{at a low}} cost. The sampled grating distributed Bragg reflector (SG-DBR) laser provides wide wavelength tuning range while exhibiting a wavelength switching speed that is among the fastest currently available. The SG-DBR laser is used to generate linear frequency ramps with high repetition rates. Since the SG-DBR laser is currently used for the telecommunications industry in high volume, {{the price of the}} system is much lower than current OCT sources. Therefore the SG-DBR laser provides a practical solution for Swept Source OCT. Four synchronized waveforms sent to the inputs of the laser control the linear frequency ramp. Three of the waveforms control the output frequency, while the fourth waveform controls the output amplifier of the laser to keep the output power stable. Two SG-DBR lasers with overlapping wavelength coverage are also concatenated to increase the bandwidth of the swept frequency source. The linear ramp <b>stitching</b> <b>points</b> in the frequency ramps are investigated and methods are outlined to reduce them. Finally, experimental OCT tests are performed using the swept frequency sources created to analyze the linearity of our sources. From these test results, an evaluation can be made on the specifications and capabilities of the swept frequency sources and analyze their value for OCT applications...|$|R
40|$|Digital Jacquard {{textiles}} {{have been}} introduced through various approaches to the capability enhancement of color expression and novel design proposition in modern weaving. Because of its a wide scope of weave colors with {{a small number of}} fillings, the basic weave structure of satin is widely adopted in the creation of shaded weave series, as they are highly reliable in presenting the natural color shading with maximized luster. However, its surface texture is limited with consistent traverse lines attributed to regular <b>stitching</b> <b>points</b> in their structure combination. Therefore, a new silhouette of shaded weave series is proposed and explored with twills to enlarge and vary the woven texture effects. The shading effect with single twills will be presented in a linear and contrasting way; when small twill lines are cut and replaced, the converted format will enable the creation of a varied surface touch. By finding the base marks where the total interlacement of a repeat is proportionally divided, small twill lines are transformed by adding interweaving points to build into a series. Furthermore, the basic principles received from satin-based shaded series are applied to the achievement of gradient shading effects. In terms of weave pattern design, each color layer is individually designed with levels of grayscales and defines each color region and color density to achieve a high-quality color presentation, as well as a unique texture.

40|$|Modern Internet applications, from HD video-conferencing {{to health}} {{monitoring}} and remote control of power-plants, pose stringent demands on network latency, bandwidth and availability. An approach {{to support such}} applications and provide inter-domain guarantees, enabling new avenues for innovation, is using centralized inter-domain routing brokers. These entities centralize routing control for mission-critical traffic across domains, working in parallel to BGP. In this work, we propose using IXPs as natural <b>points</b> for <b>stitching</b> inter-domain paths {{under the control of}} inter-domain routing brokers. To evaluate the potential of this approach, we first map the global substrate of inter-IXP pathlets that IXP members could offer, based on measurements for 229 IXPs worldwide. We show that using IXPs as <b>stitching</b> <b>points</b> has two useful properties. Up to 91 % of the total IPv 4 address space can be served by such inter-domain routing brokers when working in concert with just a handful of large IXPs and their associated ISP members. Second, path diversity on the inter-IXP graph increases by up to 29 times, as compared to current BGP valley-free routing. To exploit the rich path diversity, we introduce algorithms that inter-domain routing brokers can use to embed paths, subject to bandwidth and latency constraints. We show that our algorithms scale to the sizes of the measured graphs and can serve diverse simulated path request mixes. Our work highlights a novel direction for SDN innovation across domains, based on logically centralized control and programmable IXP fabrics.

30|$|Another {{thing to}} note {{is that there}} is a strain peak on the valve side below the <b>stitch.</b> This <b>point</b> shows the {{influence}} of the corner control point on the valve lip. The control point is fixed while pressure is applied, so there is an increase of strain here due to the control point keeping the valve up. If this stitch boundary condition were applied to a single point rather than through a control point with loading patch, a much higher strain peak would be seen along with excessive localized deformation. Other than the corners, the second highest strain is located at the base of the valve. Like the corner, strains higher than those allowed by the material are found here. It should be noted that the fixed boundary conditions at the base are probably stiffer than the actual valve. One row of sutures holds the valve to the stent, and the suture probably behaves somewhere in between a fixed and a pinned boundary.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} the weldability of a metal polymer sandwich structure. The welding of the sandwich material proceeds first by welding of the skin layer. The material selected for this research is Steelite, a sandwich structure developed by Corus, with 0. 12 mm thick mild steel skin layers adhesively bonded to a 0. 62 mm thick polypropylene core. The primary concerns when welding the skin layers of a metal polymer sandwich structure are degradation of the polymer core, and how this may affect the welding of the skin layer. For this reason low heat input pulsed laser welding was chosen, which enables precise control over {{the amount of energy}} delivered to the workpiece, and thus the heat build-up. Three types of pulsed laser welding were investigated, single spot welds, overlapping spot welds, and stitched welds. The single spot weld experiments reveal {{that it is possible to}} create almost defect free partial penetration spot welds in the skin layer of Steelite. The formation of the single spot welds occurs in three stages: initial heating where no melting occurs then melting and a rapid increase in size to a diameter dependant on the focal spot size of the laser beam, and finally growth proceeding at a decreased rate until the end of the pulse or until a blowhole is formed. Overlapping spot weld experiments were carried out with varying welding parameters. It was observed that an increase in heat input not only increases the width of the weld, as expected, but also changes the surface appearance. At low heat inputs the surface has a typical overlapping spot weld appearance. With an increase in heat input, a splash feature appears first with striking regularity. At the highest heat inputs where a weld is formed, the âsplashâ feature gives way to a rough and pocked appearance. The variation in surface appearance is of import as it is related to the depth of penetration and microstructure. The overlapping, discrete, spot weld appearance corresponds to partial penetration welds. The "splash" features appears once the welds are fully penetrated and indicate the presence and the location of flues, which have a different structure from the rest of the weld and a high carbon content. The last, pocked, surface appearance corresponds to high heat input full penetrations welds. These pocked welds have fully dendritic structures, carbon contents of approximately 5 wt. %, and Vickers hardnesses of up to 960 HV, the combination of which indicates a white cast iron structure. The absorption of carbon shifts the composition of the original mild steel towards the eutectic point on the iron carbon phase diagram, reducing the melting <b>point.</b> <b>Stitching</b> is a method of making a seam weld from overlapping spot welds while preventing the heat build up responsible for the degradation of the polymer core. Experiments show that the degradation under the stitched welds is significantly reduced in comparison to pulsed laser seam welds of comparable depth. Analytical and finite element modelling were carried out. The analytical model is based on Martin and Bowmans model which assumes a Gaussian heat source and a semi-infinite work piece. The results for the weld diameter of the single spot welds are quite accurate for short pulse times, however the results become less accurate with increasing pulse time. Finite element modelling proved more successful for predicting weld diameter for varying combinations of pulse parameters. Although the weld diameter can be predicted within 15 %, the weld penetration is almost always over predicted. Despite this, the prediction for the degraded area in the core is reasonably accurate to first order. Mechanical Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
