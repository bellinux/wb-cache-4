In fact, these methods are particularly interesting when measuring long impulse responses {{as the ones}} analyzed in architectural acoustics. However, the e ects of background and impulsive noise, distortion and time-variance are known rather qualitatively. For this reason, the ISO 18233 encourages to develop {{a deeper understanding of}} the theoretical bases of these techniques. In this sense, this project presents an in depth analysis of two di erent methods of measuring impulse responses: the linear convolution of <b>sweep</b> <b>signals</b> with the inverse lter and the circular crosscorrelation of maximum length sequences (MLS) and inverse repeated sequences (IRS). The results of this work reveal that the sweep technique can provide signi cant reduction of distortion compared to MLS/IRS technique but, unlike what is explained in the literature, <b>sweep</b> <b>signals</b> cannot reject all distortion artifacts from the causal part of the impulse response. Besides, it is proved that IRS sequences are immune to distortion of even order. On the other hand, it is con rmed that synchronous averaging procedure improves the SNR at the microphone position by 3 dB per doubling the number of averages. Alternatively, it is also proved that the noise contaminating the measured impulse response is reduced by 3 dB every time that the length of the excitation signal is doubled. In terms of impulsive noise, the sweep technique only contaminates speci c frequency bands of the system's impulse response, whereas the MLS/IRS technique uniformly distributes all impulsive noise artifacts over the entire measured impulse response. Finally, it is also shown that MLS/IRS measurements are more vulnerable to time-varying systems than sweep measurements...|$|R

Pearson’s correlation analysis indicated that PS was significantly correlated with JNDs (r = −  0.587, p =  0.045). This negative correlation between neural index and behavioral threshold of tonal sweeps is as expected and consistent with that of FDL (Marmel et al. 2013; Zhang and Gong 2017). The similar correlation analysis was conducted for the other four deviation conditions separately, and it was found that correlation was not significant for the fewer degrees (r = −  0.233, p =  0.465 for 20 % and r = −  0.431, p =  0.161 for 40 %) but significant for degrees near and beyond threshold (r = −  0.578, p =  0.049 for 80 % and r = −  0.622, p =  0.031 for 160 %).

30|$|The logsweep {{analysis}} {{technique is}} an ingenious device for analyzing static harmonic distortion {{as a function}} of frequency. Introduced by Farina in 2000 [2], the basic idea behind the logsweep analysis technique is to insert a logarithmic sine <b>sweep</b> <b>signal</b> with fixed amplitude to the system, and then convolve the time-reversed and amplitude weighted excitation signal with the system response. As a result, one obtains an impulse response signal, where the response of each harmonic distortion component is separated in time from the linear response and each other. If the duration of the logsweep signal is long enough, the time separation between the harmonic impulse responses is clear and it is straightforward to cut the individual harmonic responses and represent them in the frequency domain. As a result, one obtains magnitude response plots for the linear response and each harmonic distortion component.|$|E

To show how natural ambient noise influences the effect of sonar sweeps on porpoises, a porpoise in a pool was exposed to 1 -s duration up-sweeps, similar in frequency range (6 - 7 kHz) to those of existing naval sonar systems. The <b>sweep</b> <b>signals</b> had randomly generated sweep intervals of 3 - 7 s (duty cycle: 19). Behavioral parameters during exposure to signals were compared to those during baseline periods. The sessions were conducted under five background noise conditions: the local normal ambient noise and four conditions mimicking the spectra for wind-generated noise at Sea States 2 - 8. In all conditions, the sweeps caused the porpoise to swim further away from the transducer, surface more often, swim faster, and breathe more forcefully than during the baseline periods. However, the higher the background noise level, the smaller {{the effects of the}} sweeps on the surfacing behavior of the porpoise.

A series of bender element tests using three different techniques, the time domain (TD), cross-correlation (CC), and frequency domain (FD) techniques, were performed to estimate travel times on identical specimens in triaxial or unconfined compression apparatuses. Experimental results revealed that the CC technique can provide reasonable values of the travel time by the maximum peak point for soft soils, while it is difficult to apply to sandy or artificially treated soils because of the unclear arrival point. From both, experimental investigation and numerical analysis of CC, the frequency dependence of the travel time is demonstrated. As a result of travel time estimation using frequency <b>sweep</b> <b>signals,</b> strong dispersion and scattering of phase and group velocities due to the non-linearity of the test system are indicated in the FD technique.

Our proposition is a truly volumetric alarm system that can detect any movement in the intrusion area, based on monitoring the change over time of the impulse response of the room, which acts as an acoustic footprint. The device depends on an omnidirectional ultrasonic transducer array emitting <b>sweep</b> <b>signals</b> to calculate the impulse response in short intervals. Any change in the room conditions is monitored through a correlation function. The sensitivity of the alarm to different objects and different environments depends on the sweep duration, sweep bandwidth, and sweep interval. Successful detection of intrusions also depends on the size of the monitoring area and requires an adjustment of emitted ultrasound power. Strong air flow affects the performance of the alarm. A method for separating moving objects from strong air flow is devised using an adaptive thresholding on the correlation function involving a series of impulse response measurements. The alarm system can be also used for fire detection since air flow sourced from heating objects differ from random nature of the present air flow. Several measurements are made to test the integrity of the alarm in rooms sizing from 834 - 2080 m 3 with irregular geometries and various objects.

40|$|Detecting {{positive}} selection in species with heterogeneous habitats and complex demography is notoriously difficult {{and prone to}} statistical biases. The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana exemplifies this problem: In spite of the large amounts of data, little evidence for classic selective sweeps has been found. Moreover, {{many aspects of the}} demography are unclear, whichmakes it hard to judge whether the few signals are indeed signs of selection, or false positives caused by demographic events. Here, we focus on Swedish A. thaliana and we find that the demography can be approximated as a two-population model. Careful analysis of the data shows that such a two island model is characterized by a very old split time that significantly predates the last glacial maximum followed by secondary contact with strong migration. We evaluate selection based on this demography and find that this secondary contact model strongly affects the power to detect sweeps. Moreover, it affects the power differently for northern Sweden (more false positives) as compared with southern Sweden (more false negatives). However, even when the demographic history is accounted for, <b>sweep</b> <b>signals</b> in northern Sweden are stronger than in southern Sweden, with little or no positional overlap. Further simulations including the complex demography and selection confirm that this is not compatible with global selection acting on both pop-ulations, and thus can be taken as evidence for local selection within subpopulations of Swedish A. thaliana.
