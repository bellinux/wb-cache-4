40|$|Face {{recognition}} is a challenging problem for <b>surveillance</b> view <b>images</b> commonly encountered in a forensic face recognition case. One approach {{to deal with}} a non-frontal test image is to synthesize the corresponding frontal view image and compare it with frontal view reference images. However, {{it is often difficult to}} synthesize a good quality frontal view <b>image</b> from a <b>surveillance</b> video because the test image is usually of low quality. In this paper, we investigate if it is useful to instead transform the reference images so that it matches the pose, illumination and camera of the <b>surveillance</b> view test <b>image.</b> This approach, also called the view based approach, ensures that a face recognition system always gets to compare images having a similar, not necessarily the frontal, view. Our results with <b>surveillance</b> view <b>images</b> captured 6 months apart (taken from the MultiPIE data set) and using five different face recognition systems show that improved recognition performance under surveillance conditions can be attained by exactly matching the pose, illumination and camera between the test and reference images...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method to}} {{distinguish}} pedestrians facing {{to the front and}} the side by using a low resolution and quality <b>surveillance</b> <b>image</b> sequence. In the past, there have been many methods to estimate the head orientation of a pedestrian. However, because all these methods use facial texture information to achieve the goal, it is difficult to apply the methods to a low resolution and quality image sequence that does not include enough information. Therefore, we focus on the gait change of a pedestrian, which can be acquired even from a low-resolution silhouette sequence. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method by using low-resolution image sequences of over one hundred subjects. Keywords—head orientation estimation; gait; low resolution images; I...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{outlines}} {{the development of}} a mathematical model which can be used to perform 3 D reconstruction of a target object from <b>surveillance</b> <b>images.</b> 3 D reconstruction is a common procedure in photogrammetry, but performing 3 D reconstruction from <b>surveillance</b> <b>images</b> can be more difficult than typical photogrammetry applications. <b>Surveillance</b> <b>images</b> are generally captured in an unsystematic manner because there is no control over the target that is being photographed. <b>Surveillance</b> <b>images</b> can have a wide variety of fields of view, are often captured with uncalibrated cameras, and typically the targets are objects {{for which there is no}} other a priori information. For these reasons, performing 3 D reconstruction from <b>surveillance</b> <b>images</b> may not be possible using standard photogrammetric methods, especially when the angular fields of view of the images are rather narrow...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{builds on}} a novel, fast {{algorithm}} for generating the convex layers on grid points with linear time complexity. Convex layers are {{extracted from the}} binary image. The obtained convex hulls are characterized by the number oftheir vertices and used as representative image features. A computational geometric approach to near-duplicate image detection stems from these features. Similarity of feature vectors of given images is assessed by correlation coefficient. This way, all images with closely related structure and contents can be retrieved from large databases of images quickly and efficiently. The algorithm {{can be used in}} various applications such as video <b>surveillance,</b> <b>image</b> and video duplication search, or image alignment. Our approach is rather robust up to moderate signal-to-noise ratios, tolerates lossy image compression, and copes with translated, rotated and scaled image contents...|$|R

The article undertakes this work by analyzing remediations of the CCTV images of Diana Spencer and Dodi Al-Fayed in the Ritz Hotel in Paris on 30 August 1997 in television news and a documentary from 2007 and 2011, respectively. It is shown how social memory of Diana’s death is a contested site, in which the images play a specific role...|$|R

40|$|In {{this chapter}} we propose a novel {{approach}} for real-time robust pedestrian tracking in <b>surveillance</b> <b>images.</b> Typical <b>surveillance</b> <b>images</b> are challenging to analyse since the overall image quality is low (e. g. low resolution and high compression). Furthermore often birds-eye viewpoint wide-angle lenses are used to achieve maximum coverage with a minimal amount of cameras. These specific viewpoints make it unfeasible to directly apply existing pedestrian detection techniques. Moreover, real-time processing speeds are required. To overcome these problems we introduce a pedestrian detection and tracking framework which exploits and integrates these scene constraints to achieve high accuracy results. We performed extensive experiments on publically available challenging real-life video sequences concerning both speed and accuracy. Our approach achieves excellent accuracy results while still meeting the stringent real-time demands needed for these surveillance applications, using only a single-core CPU implementation. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|The {{increasing}} demand for protection and surveillance {{of the coastal}} areas requires modern coastal surveillance radars. These radars are designed such that small objects can be detected. Therefore, there is an increasing amount of information for the radar observer. Moreover, the number of false and unwanted objects increases as the demand for seeing small objects makes the radar more sensitive. Generally, the false objects can be avoided by using a reliable tracker. However, the tracker does not exclude unwanted objects. The difference between false and unwanted objects is that false objects do not originate from true objects but are mainly noise objects, whereas the unwanted objects originate from true objects but are unwanted in the <b>surveillance</b> <b>image.</b> These objects depend on {{the purpose of the}} radar; however, for coastal surveillance radars, the unwanted objects are normally birds, wakes from large ships, etc.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Efficiently {{identifying}} salient {{objects in}} large im-age collections {{is essential for}} many applications including <b>image</b> retrieval, <b>surveillance,</b> <b>image</b> annotation, and object recognition. We propose a simple, fast, and effective algo-rithm for locating and segmenting salient objects by analysing image collections. As a key novelty, we introduce group saliency to achieve superior unsupervised salient object seg-mentation by extracting salient objects (in collections of pre-filtered images) that maximize between-image similarities and within-image distinctness. To evaluate our method, we construct a large benchmark dataset consisting of 15 K im-ages across multiple categories with 6000 + pixel-accurate ground truth annotations for salient object regions where applicable. In all our tests, group saliency consistently out-performs state-of-the-art single-image saliency algorithms, resulting in both higher precision and better recall. Our al-gorithm successfully handles image collections, of an or-der larger than any existing benchmark datasets, consisting of diverse and heterogeneous images from various internet sources...|$|R
