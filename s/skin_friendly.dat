40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{impact of}} {{personal}} care devices on skin is mainly assessed using subjective tools. However, new objective, accurate non-invasive in vivo imaging techniques have been developed. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the ability of reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) in quantifying morphological impact of shavers on skin. Furthermore, tape stripping (TS) as method to study morphological impact of shavers was evaluated. METHODS: In 12 healthy male subjects, for two consecutive days, a split-face test was performed in the neck; on one side a shaver was applied, while the other side was exposed to TS. The stratum corneum (SC) thickness was quantified using RCM and sensory observations were evaluated using questionnaires. RESULTS: Shavers with a different impact on skin, can be discriminated by RCM; shaver B removed more SC after application than the <b>skin</b> <b>friendlier</b> shaver A. Furthermore, the changes in SC thickness induced by TS corresponded well to that of the shavers. CONCLUSION: RCM is able to quantify the impact of different shavers on skin. Besides, TS appeared to be a suitable model mimicking the mechanical impact of shavers on skin. RCM in combination with the TS model appeared to be a suitable minimally invasive model to obtain morphological and cell biological data on skin-material interactions caused by different personal care devices...|$|R
40|$|Background: Normal healthy skin has {{potential}} of hydrogen (pH) range of 5. 4 - 5. 9 and a normal bacterial flora. Use of soap with high pH causes {{an increase in}} skin pH, which in turn causes an increase in dehydrative effect, irritability and alteration in bacterial flora. The majority of soaps and shampoos available in the market do not disclose their pH. Aims and Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the pH of different brands of bathing soaps and shampoos available in the market. Materials and Methods: The samples of soaps and shampoos were collected from shops in the locality. The samples of different brands are coded before the analysis of the pH. Solution of each sample was made and pH was measured using pH meter. Results: Majority of the soaps have a pH within the range of 9 - 10. Majority of the shampoos have a pH within the range of 6 - 7. Conclusions: The soaps and shampoos commonly used by the population at large have a pH outside the range of normal skin and hair pH values. Therefore, it is hoped that before recommending soap to patient especially those who have sensitive and acne prone skin, due consideration is given to the pH factor and also that manufacturers will give a thought to pH of soaps and shampoos manufactured by them, so that their products will be more <b>skin</b> and hair <b>friendly...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Throughout someone's life, {{they are}} {{constantly}} learning while using their senses. An {{important factor in}} sensory integration is perception. There are three steps on how perception is created. First is sensation, when as individuals, we capture the energies from our environment and push them onto our orifices and rubbing against our <b>skin,</b> forming brain <b>friendly</b> electrical language. [...] Second is routing, when the sensation is translated into head-speak and sent off to the appropriate regions of the brain for further processing. [...] Third the perception formed, when the various senses merge {{and sent to the}} brain. [...] However, no scientist is entirely sure how brain perception works. Although Medina did arrive to this conclusion: the sensory information absorbed in an event through our sense translates into electrical signals, dispersing {{in different parts of the}} brain, perceiving the event as a whole. [...] This can be concluded with the majority of scientists. Furthermore, Medina states the brain relies on past experiences to decide how to combine these signals. [...] Thus two people can perceive the same event in very different ways. Next, all the senses have evolved over time to work together. For example, an individual’s vision influences their hearing-which implies that learning is at its best when stimulated with several senses at once. In addition, Medina explains that the sense of smell has the gift of bringing back memories. [...] He theorized that the sense of smell bypasses the thalamus and heads straight its destination, which includes the site of emotions known at the amygdala. [...] Having this in mind, Medina's dream school setting would incorporate multiple senses in a school setting and the specific scents in a work/business setting, thus enhancing your level of learning.|$|R

40|$|The {{international}} fragrance {{market is}} worth £ 15 billion {{and set to}} grow to £ 27 billion by the year 2011. It is market-driven and not product-driven and is looking for new innovation at all times. It is expected that the already high demands placed on the fragrance industry for increasing pressures to innovate will result in new systems of precisely metered fragrance delivery and release, which could replace the unmetered technology of the Twentieth Century. The purpose of this business plan is to exploit the intellectual property developed during a jewellery project called eScent™ at the Innovation Centre at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design University of The Arts London, funded by an Innovation Award from the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and which resulted in Sensory Design & Technology Ltd, a unique Fashion Technology spinout company being established in Cambridge UK. The company aims to change the experience of fragrance using emerging technologies, such as microfluidic MEMS technology, with the ancient art of perfumery and fusing this with fashion design. Sensory Design & Technology Ltd has developed novel technology for wearable devices capable of delivering fragrances on demand, in response to user-driven stimuli. The first product is eScent™, a button-size, user-worn scent dispenser where the frequency and type of delivery is flexible and determined by the user. What makes this technology novel from existing fragrance delivery methods (such as the traditional perfume bottle) is that is offers the user a totally new experience that not only switches tone and intensity rapidly, by targeting fragrance to exactly the right place and at the right time, but also insures a localised, non-invasive delivery method which can be less irritable to the <b>skin</b> and <b>friendlier</b> to the environment (since less fragrance is atomised in the atmosphere). It could revitalise the fragrance industry by opening up new design possibilities for packaging, whilst {{reducing the amount of}} materials required to produce glass bottles. It offers an exciting new innovation for a generation of young women who have grown up with the iPod and expect the latest technology they carry around to deliver real value, with functionality, style, elegance and simplicity. The company was founded by Dr Jenny Tillotson, a senior research fellow in fashion and textile design at Central Saint Martins and nominee of the 2006 Fragrance Foundation ‘FiFi’ Awards (the ‘Oscars’ of the fragrance industry), who is acknowledged as a pioneer of computerised scent-output systems worn on the body for wellbeing; in partnership with Professor Andreas Manz, a pioneer of lab-on-a-chip for analytical applications; John Ayres, who is the Chairman of the Fragrance Foundation; and Jonathan Lloyd-Platt, an executive in marketing, international licensing and retailing from the fashion and design industries...|$|R

The nonedible Jatropha oil has been checked as the alternative {{raw material for}} SL synthesis using C. bombicola (ATCC 22214). This is useful towards lowering the SL production cost. Through optimization of fermentation parameters and use of resting cell method, the yield 15. 25 [*]g/L could be achieved for Jatropha oil derived SL (SLJO) with 1 % v/v oil feeding. The synthesized SL displayed good surfactant property.

40|$|Technical {{textiles}} {{are one of}} {{the fastest}} growing sectors of the global textile industry, especially in the medical application which is considered as one of the most important applications of technical textiles. Plaster (gypsum) and plastics casts are widely used nowadays in hospitals, pharmacies and health care centers. But they are heavy, not washable, do not offer a suitable fixation for bone fractures (e. g. hand wrist) and always in individually sizes. After decrease of swelling, the cast is in a hard form and the stabilization effect of the cast is insufficient due to the occurring of distance between the skin and the cast. In this work, a new pneumatic cast is developed, that depends on a coated fabric as an outer layer, <b>skin</b> <b>friendly</b> fabrics as internal layers, air chamber and metal braces. For more comfort, the cast is anatomically formed and includes four internal layers of cotton/viscose fabric and polyester spacer fabric. The new developed cast controls the pressure on the injured part by using a pneumatic system. In a comparison with plaster and plastic casts that are heavy, not washable, provide an insufficient fixation after swelling decrease and always in individually sizes; the new developed pneumatic cast is light weight, easy to use, washable, mass-produced and offer the required fixation to the injured part during swelling conditions...|$|E

40|$|In this work, chitin, {{the second}} most {{abundant}} biopolymer in the nature, was used as antimicrobial agent for textile finishing. Antimicrobial agents can protect textiles from attack of microorganisms, which are {{the reason for the}} damage of textiles and for the discomfort of the people. Chitin is known as <b>skin</b> <b>friendly,</b> nontoxic and environmentally sound antimicrobial agent. Chitin is not soluble in water, thus it has to be derivatized for application in textile finishing which is performed usually from aqueous media. At first, chitosan, the deacetylated form of chitin, was depolymerized with sodium nitrite to produce chitooligosaccharides. The degree of polymerization was determined by colorimetry. Furthermore, chitosan was modified with quaternary ammonium groups to get a better soluble product {{and at the same time}} a better effect against bacteria. For this, chitosan was reacted with diethylaminoethyl groups at the hydroxy and amino groups. The synthesized product was characterized with the help of IR-, Raman-, NMR- and 2 D-NMR-spectroscopy as well as by elemental analysis and TGA. The degree of substitution was determined by means of NMR-spectroscopy, elemental analysis and conductometry. The synthesized product was then quaternized with ethyliodide, dimethylsulfate or diethylsulfate. The structure of the products was confirmed by IR-, Raman- and NMR-spectroscopy. The degree of quaternization was determined with the help of NMR-spectroscopy, elemental analysis and XPS. The synthesized chitosan derivatives were applied onto textiles. Polycarboxylic acid was used to fix the chitosan derivatives on cotton fabrics. The amount of the fixed derivatives on the fabrics was determined by means of elemental analysis. Furthermore, the chitosan derivatives were subjected to antimicrobial tests in solution. TEAE-chitosaniodide and MDEAE-chitosanmethylsulfate show very good activity against Vibrio fischeri, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli...|$|E
40|$|Scoliosis is an S-shaped {{sideways}} {{curvature of}} the spine leading to the shape change of the torso Idiopathic scoliosis is one form of this disease with unknown aetiology. 300 children out of 100 000 need treatment. Treatment duration is {{till the end of}} the patient’s growth age (till the ossification of the skeleton) and the brace should be worn 23 hours a day. Problems with brace are: heat, moist, heavy, stiff, affects skin, odor, medical look, etc. Thus, the main objectives were to improve heat and moisture dissipation from the brace. However, it was to be kept in mind that the brace is an orthopaedic aid and its positive effect has been documented and proven over decades. A new brace was designed but the question was: Is it better? To answer the question the tests on the thermal manikin were carried out with constant surface temperature mode, stable temperature and humidity in the climatic chamber, recording of power input (heat loss) and having manikin on weighting scale for continuous recording of evaporation. With manikin tests we could show that the dry insulation of old and new brace was similar. There was 30 % better moisture dissipation from new compared to the old brace. Heat dissipation from new brace was most probably improved due to higher evaporative heat losses and optimizing the openings may improve ventilation even more. In addition, following positive effects were achieved: the brace looks lighter and is more airy and <b>skin</b> <b>friendly</b> because of the openings, the new brace is by 3 mm thinner, therefore more fitting under clothing, openings and the thinner inner lining reduced the weight of the brace, the changeable inner lining makes frequent machine washing possible, but also use of linings in different colour...|$|E

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} the most common female {{malignancy}} in the western world. Currently, tamoxifen remains the gold standard anti-hormone for ER+ breast cancer. However de novo resistance to tamoxifen is a huge clinical problem. What is more, as many as 50 % of initial responders develop acquired resistance to tamoxifen and relapse. Aberrant growth factor signalling has been linked to the resistant phenotype, in particular EGFR and IGF-IR signalling and often gives a more aggressive disease type and poorer patient outlook. There is a substantial clinical need for new anti-breast cancer therapeutics that target the resistant phenotype or prevent this from occurring. One hypothesis is to combine both anti-hormonal therapies with anti-EGFR therapies, in hope of preventing resistant growth. Many downstream pathways of EGFR have been targeted to develop novel therapeutics against however, these compounds are almost certain to give severe adverse reactions, furthermore a complex tablet regime or IV injections {{have a negative effect on}} patient compliance. A novel transcutaneous delivery system would give a more patient friendly alternative, with patients re-applying a patch or cream once a day, with rapid termination of dosing in the event of adverse event This would also go some way to prevent endometrial complications associated with tamoxifen use. The in vitro simultaneous delivery of 4 -hydroxytamoxifen and signal transduction inhibitors LY 294002 and PD 98059 along with EPA determined that all compounds were capable of permeating porcine skin and nipple. Masses able to permeate were 5. 14 0. 93, 6. 97 0. 99, 5. 06 0. 93 and 1121. 6 143 μgcm 2 across skin respectively and 21. 14 2. 75, 18. 2 2. 55, 25. 1 6. 89 and 3081. 2 252. 7 μgcm 2 across porcine nipple. These compounds were formulated with 2. 5 % v/v DMSO and ethanol and 4 % w/v Cab-o-sil. Fish oil was shown to be a <b>skin</b> <b>friendly</b> vehicle. Ki- 67 assays confirmed that incubation with fish oil maintained skin viability and H & E staining confirmed no obvious histological effects. Growth Studies were performed on MCF- 7 and TamR cells and showed that the combination of these compounds was able to reduce cell growth to 4. 04 0. 15 and 2. 47 1. 4 % of control growth when incubated at 25 μM PD 98059 μM LY 294002 x 10 7 M 4 -hydroytamoxifen and 1 μLmL - 1 fish oil. This combination of compounds, without 4 -hydroxytamoxifen, was able to reduce the migratory capacity of TamR cells (P = < 0. 005). Results confirmed that the simultaneous transcutaneous delivery of multiple anti-breast cancer agents is possible and that these show promising anti- tumorogenic actions post skin.
