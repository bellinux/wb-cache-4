6000|$|A {{perfectly}} healthy sentence, it is true, is extremely rare. For {{the most part}} we miss the hue and fragrance of the thought; as if we could {{be satisfied with the}} dews of the morning or evening without their colors, or the heavens without their azure. The most attractive sentences are, perhaps, not the wisest, but the surest and roundest. They are spoken firmly and conclusively, as if the speaker had a right to know what he says, and if not wise, they have at least been well learned. Sir Walter Raleigh might well be studied if only for the excellence of his style, for he is remarkable in the midst of so many masters. There is a natural emphasis in his style, like a man's tread, and a breathing space between the sentences, which the best of modern writing does not furnish. His chapters are like English parks, or say rather like a Western forest, where the larger growth keeps down the underwood, and one may ride on horseback through the openings. All the distinguished writers of that period possess a greater vigor and naturalness than the more modern,--for it is allowed to slander our own time,--and when we read a quotation from one of them {{in the midst of a}} modern author, we seem to have come suddenly upon a greener ground, a greater depth and strength of soil. It is as if a green bough were laid across the page, and we are refreshed as by the sight of fresh grass in midwinter or early spring. You have constantly the warrant of life and experience in what you read. The little that is said is eked out by implication of the much that was done. The sentences are verdurous and blooming as evergreen and flowers, because they are rooted in fact and experience, but our false and florid sentence have only the tints of flowers without their sap or roots. All men are really most attracted by the beauty of plain speech, and they even write in a florid style in imitation of this. They prefer to be misunderstood rather than to come short of its exuberance. Hussein Effendi praised the epistolary style of Ibrahim Pasha to the French traveller Botta, because of [...] "the difficulty of understanding it; there was," [...] he said, [...] "but one person at Jidda, who was capable of understanding and explaining the Pasha's correspondence." [...] A man's whole life is taxed for the least thing well done. It is its net result. Every sentence is the result of a long probation. Where shall we look for standard English, but to the words of a <b>standard</b> <b>man?</b> The word which is best said came nearest to not being spoken at all, for it is cousin to a deed which the speaker could have better done. Nay, almost it must have taken the place of a deed by some urgent necessity, even by some misfortune, so that the truest writer will be some captive knight, after all. And perhaps the fates had such a design, when, having stored Raleigh so richly with the substance of life and experience, they made him a fast prisoner, and compelled him to make his words his deeds, and transfer to his expression the emphasis and sincerity of his action.|$|E

50|$|In 1964, {{development}} work began at Bölkow upon the helicopter {{that would become}} the Bo 105, although work on the hingeless rotor it would use had begun earlier. On 16 February 1967, the second Bo 105A prototype conducted its maiden flight at Ottobrunn in Germany; the first public demonstration was held in May 1967. The test program was broken down into stages as the Bo 105 comprised a new airframe, new rotor system, and a new engine; thus the flying Bo 105 prototype was initially equipped with a main rotor from Westland Helicopter's Scout rotorcraft {{and a pair of}} Allison Model 250 turboshaft engines instead of their production counterparts. Sud Aviation worked with Bölkow on developing the rotorcraft; an Alouette II helicopter was modified with the Bo 105's rotor and used to test its performance envelope.

40|$|The 70 -kg {open_quotes}standard man{close_quotes} {{representing}} a typical Western adult male {{has been used}} in physiological models since at least the 1920 s. In 1949 at the Chalk River conference, health physicists from the U. S., UK, and Canada agreed on the concept of a <b>standard</b> <b>man</b> to facilitate comparison of internal dose estimates. The 70 -kg <b>standard</b> <b>man</b> included specifications of the masses of 25 organs and tissues, total body content of 15 elements, total water intake and output, water content of the body, and some anatomical and physiological data for the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. In 1959, in its Publication 2 {sup 2 } on permissible doses for internal radiation the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) modified <b>standard</b> <b>man.</b> In 1963 the ICRP established a task group to revise and extend the <b>standard</b> <b>man</b> concept. The name was changed later to Reference Man and the task group`s work was published in 1975 as ICRP Publication 23 {sup 3 }. Publication 23 similar to Publication 2, updates and documents the sources of the data. Data on women, children, and fetuses were also collected, where available, but these data were limited primarily to anatomical data and only a few reference values were established for these groups. Information assembled {{during the course of the}} effort on the Reference Man report was used at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to construct a mathematical representation of the body (a phantom) that was suitable for use with Monte Carlo methods in the calculation of organ doses. That effort was undertaken to improve estimates of dose from photon-emitting radionuclides residing within organs, so-called internal emitters. The phantom, although updated throughout the years, remains today as the basis for organ dose estimates in nuclear medicine and radiation protection and underlies the radiation risk data derived from the epidemiologic studies of the atomic bomb survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki...|$|E

40|$|Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) using 131 I-tositumomab {{has been}} used {{successfully}} to treat relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). Our approach to treatment plan-ning has been to determine limits on radiation absorbed dose to critical nonhematopoietic organs. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using CT to adjust for actual organ volumes in calculating organ-specific absorbed dose estimates. Methods: Records of 84 patients who underwent biodistribution studies after a trace-labeled infusion of 131 I-tositumomab for RIT (Jan-uary 1990 and April 2003) were reviewed. Serial planar -cam-era images and whole-body NaI probe counts were obtained to estimate 131 I-antibody source-organ residence times as recom-mended by the MIRD Committee.

40|$|Abstract The current {{situation}} of Chinese dialects is very complicated, {{not only because}} there are hundred kinds of dialects, sub-dialects and sub-sub-dialects, but also because many dialect speakers are speaking Mandarin with different regional accents affected by their dialects. If dialect utterances are represented acoustically, their acoustic features depend both on dialectal linguistic features and extra-linguistic features such as the age, gender, micro-phone, etc. Then, the automatic pronunciation assessment of Chinese dialects becomes a challenging task. In this paper, we propose to analyze the dialect pronunciation by the structural representation, which was originally used to remove extra-linguistic information from speech. After collecting the utterances of some selected Chinese written characters, the pronunciation structures are built for dialect speakers and their pronunciations are compared by the distances among the structures. Then with the dialect utterances of 16 native dialect speakers, some experi-ments are carried out to analyze their pronunciations using the structures and linguistically-reasonable results are obtained. At last, by comparing the pronunciation structures of dialect speakers with those of two <b>standard</b> <b>Man...</b>|$|E
40|$|It is {{important}} to measure organ dose in diagnostic radiology & radiotherapy. Because measurement on patients has some limitations, phantoms are being constructed to be implemented. One kind of several phantoms which is being used so far is anthropomorphic phantom {{which is similar to}} a man.

Phantom dimensions were selected from the <b>standard</b> <b>man.</b> To measure absorbed dose in tissues, at the sites of parotid, thyroid, sternum, diaphragm, abdomen and hip some cylinders were inserted which were constructed from phantom material and had some cavities to insert TLDs in different depths. Due to importance of photoelectric effect in diagnostic radiology & Compton effect in radiotherapy, two important parameters which should be considered in construction of a phantom is effective atomic number and electronic density were 6. 57 & 3. 36 × 1023 electron. gr- 1, respectively...|$|E

40|$|WRAITH is a FORTRAN {{computer}} code which calculates the doses received by a <b>standard</b> <b>man</b> exposed to an accidental release of radioactive material. The {{movement of the}} released material through the atmosphere is calculated using a bivariate straight-line Gaussian distribution model, with Pasquill values for standard deviations. The quantity of material in the released cloud is modified during its transit time to account for radioactive decay and daughter production. External doses due to exposure to the cloud can be calculated using a semi-infinite cloud approximation. In situations where the semi-infinite cloud approximation {{is not a good}} one, the external dose can be calculated by a "finite plume" three-dimensional point-kernel numerical integration technique. Internal doses due to acute inhalation are cal. culated using the ICRP Task Group Lung Model and a four-segmented gastro-intestinal tract model. Translocation of the material between body compartments and retention in the body compartments are calculated using multiple exponential retention functions. Internal doses to each organ are calculated as sums of cross-organ doses, with each target organ irradiated by radioactive material in a number of source organs. All doses are calculated in rads, with separate values determined for high-LET and low-LET radiation...|$|E
40|$|The {{quantitative}} {{evaluation of the}} human hazard due to exposure to nonionizing radiation requires the estimation of the em. absorption by the various tissues of the human body. In this paper, a numerical method is proposed, {{which can be used}} to predict the distribution of electromagnetic absorption inside the human body (simulated by a 3 D block model consisting of variable-sized cells). Electromagnetic scattering is studied, taking into account the mutual coupling between the source (i. e., an antenna) and the body. A moment-method formulation is adopted to reduce to matrix form the well-known integro-differential equation of direct electromagnetic scattering and the equations of the boundary conditions of the electromagnetic source. A domain decomposition is performed that allows one to use limited computational resources and to perform an off-line evaluation of the invariant model portions. Simulations results are reported, concerning the block model of a <b>standard</b> <b>man</b> (175 cm tall) made up of 450 cells and exposed to the aperture antenna.

40|$|Models {{of human}} {{thermoregulation}} and heat transfer {{date from the}} early 1970 s and {{have been developed for}} applications ranging from evaluating thermal comfort in spacecraft and aircraft cabin environments to predicting heat stress during EVAs. Most lumped or compartment models represent the body as an assemblage cylindrical and spherical elements which may be subdivided into layers to describe tissue heterogeneity. Many existing models are of limited usefulness in asymmetric thermal environments, such as may be encountered during an EVA. Conventional whole-body clothing models also limit the ability to describe local surface thermal and evaporation effects in sufficient detail. A further limitation is that models based on a <b>standard</b> <b>man</b> model are not readily scalable to represent large or small subjects. This work describes development of a new human thermal model derived from the 41 -node man model. Each segment is divided into four concentric, constant thickness cylinders made up of a central core surrounded by muscle, fat, and skin, respectively. These cylinders are connected by the flow of blood from a central blood pool to each part. The central blood pool is updated at each time step, based on a whole-body energy balance. Results show the model simulates core and surface temperature histories, sweat evaporation and metabolic rates which generally are consistent with controlled exposures of human subjects. Scaling rules are developed to enable simulation of small and large subjects (5 th percentile and 95 th percentile). Future refinements will include a clothing model that addresses local surface insulation and permeation effects and developing control equations to describe thermoregulatory effects such as may occur with prolonged weightlessness or with aging...|$|E

40|$|Pharmacokinetic (PK) and {{pharmacodynamic}} (PD) {{data were}} available {{from a study}} of a nasal delivery system for the opioid analgesic fentanyl, together with data on the kinetics of fentanyl in arterial blood in man, and in the lung and brain of sheep. Our aim was to reconcile these data using a physiologically-based population recirculatory PK-PD model, with emphasis on achieving a meta-model that could simultaneously account for the arterial and venous (arm) concentrations of fentanyl, could relate PD effects (pain scores) to the CNS concentrations of fentanyl, and {{could account for the}} effect of body size and age on fentanyl kinetics. Data on the concentration gradients of fentanyl across brain, lung and muscle were used to develop sub-models of fentanyl kinetics in these organs. The sub-models were incorporated into a "whole body" recirculatory model by adding additional sub-models for a venous mixing compartment, the liver and gut, the kidney and the "rest of the body" with blood flows and organ volumes based on values for a <b>Standard</b> <b>Man.</b> Inter-individual variability was achieved by allometric scaling of organ size and blood flows, evidence-based assumptions about the effect of weight and age on cardiac output, and inter-individual variability in the free fraction in plasma and hepatic extraction of fentanyl. Post-operative pain scores were found to be temporally related to the predicted brain concentrations of fentanyl. We conclude that a physiologically-based meta-modelling approach was able to describe clinical PK-PD studies of fentanyl whilst providing a mechanistic interpretation of key aspects of its disposition.

40|$|Dietary {{survey on}} 42 {{families}} in 7 villages in Khonkaen district was carried out. Though mean calorie intake was sufficient (2296 Cal), protein intake from animal sources was extremely low. This {{was due to}} the fact that farmers ate large amount of rice and other dietary items were used only to make the rice more flavorful. Eightynine percent of the total calorie was taken from rice. Mean intake of iron was 7. 9 mg/person/day. <b>Standard</b> <b>man</b> ratio made it possible to calculate individual iron intakes from the data of family survey. Iron intakes of each group were 5. 6 mg in 1 - 3 years, 8. 6 mg in 4 - 5 years, 10. 3 mg in 6 - 9 years, 11. 2 mg in 10 - 12 years, 16. 1 mg in males over 13 years, 12. 5 mg in nonpregnant females, 11. 2 mg in females over 50 years and 17 mg in pregnant and lactating women respectively. Folic acid contents of 52 Thai foods were assayed microbiologically using Lactobacillus casei. Calculation of folic acid intake was also performed using the results of folate assay of foods and other data from literatures. Intake of free folate was 217. 4 μg/person/day and total folate 346. 1 μg/person/day. In conclusion, iron intake of the farmers in this district was insufficient except in adult males to meet the increased requirements of children and women. Folic acid intake was rather abundant.

40|$|Background: This study {{examines}} {{the use of}} a simple thermoregulatory model for the human body exposed to extended (45 minute) exposures to radiofrequency/microwave (RF/MW) energy at different frequencies (100, 450, 2450 MHz) and under different environmental conditions. The exposure levels were comparable to or above present limits for human exposure to RF energy. Methods: We adapted a compartmental model for the human thermoregulatory system developed by Hardy and Stolwijk, adding power to the torso skin, fat, and muscle compartments to simulate exposure to RF energy. The model uses values for parameters for 2 ̆ 2 <b>standard</b> <b>man</b> 2 ̆ 2 that were originally determined by Hardy and Stolwijk, with no additional adjustment. The model predicts changes in core and skin temperatures, sweat rate, and changes in skin blood flow as a result of RF energy exposure. Results: The model yielded remarkably good quantitative agreement between predicted and measured changes in skin and core temperatures, and qualitative agreement between predicted and measured changes in skin blood flow. The model considerably underpredicted the measured sweat rates. Conclusions: The model, with previously determined parameter values, was successful in predicting major aspects of human thermoregulatory response to RF energy exposure over a wide frequency range, and at different environmental temperatures. The model was most successful in predicting changes in skin temperature, and it provides insights into the mechanisms by which the heat added to body by RF energy is dissipated to the environment. Several factors are discussed that {{may have contributed to the}} failure to account properly for sweat rate. Some features of the data, in particular heating of the legs and ankles during exposure at 100 MHz, would require a more complex model than that considered here...|$|E

40|$|The Teagasc National Farm Survey (NFS) is {{undertaken}} annually {{to determine the}} financial situation on Irish farms. The principal measure of the income arising from farming activities is Family Farm Income (FFI) per farm. In addition to analysing farm income by system and size of farm, NFS data can also be analysed for Full-time and Part-time farms to determine the variation in income that occurs. In this paper the variation in FFI on Part-time and Full-time farms is analysed by system of farming. In the NFS Full-time farms are defined as those which require at least 0. 75 Standard Labour Units to operate, as calculated on a <b>Standard</b> <b>Man</b> Day (SMD) basis. Farms are therefore divided into Full-time and Part-time {{on the basis of}} the estimated labour required to operate their farms as distinct from labour available, which is often in excess of that required. The total number of farms represented nationally is 111, 115. Full-time farms represent the larger more commercial sector of farming and in 2005 accounted for 38 % (or 42, 300) of all farms represented by the NFS. Fifty five percent of Full-time farms were in the two dairying systems with 34 % in the drystock systems with the remaining 11 % in the Tillage systems. Of the 62 % of farms which were Part-time, 88 % were in the drystock systems. The average FFI on all Part-time farms in 2005 was € 11, 372, ranging from € 16, 933 on Dairy farms to € 9, 995 on Sheep farms. On 58 % of Part-time farms either the farm holder or spouse had an off-farm job and on 94 % of farms, there was another source of income – either from an off-farm job, pension or social assistance.
