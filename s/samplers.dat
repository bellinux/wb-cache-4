5|$|Printed pattern {{books were}} not easily obtainable, and a sampler or {{embroidered}} record of stitches and patterns {{was the most}} common form of reference. 16th-century English <b>samplers</b> were stitched on a narrow band of fabric and totally covered with stitches. These band <b>samplers</b> were highly valued, often being mentioned in wills and passed down through the generations. These <b>samplers</b> were stitched using a variety of needlework styles, threads, and ornament.|$|E

5|$|The Mellotron {{was used}} by German {{electronic}} band Tangerine Dream through the 1970s, on albums such as Atem (1973), Phaedra (1974), Rubycon (1975), Stratosfear (1976), and Encore (1977). In 1983, the band's Christopher Franke asked Mellotronics if they could produce a digital model, as the group migrated towards using <b>samplers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Due to a tight budget, Larkin {{was unable}} to hire an {{orchestra}} to perform the music; all the instruments in the soundtrack aside from Larkin's own trumpet playing are sampled instruments. Larkin {{used a variety of}} synthesizers, <b>samplers,</b> and computers to create the score, working at his home studio and Cyan's offices. Larkin found that the biggest challenge with the score was finishing it on time for the game to ship. The soundtrack was released in CD format on October 25, 2005.|$|E

5|$|Since I Left You is {{the debut}} studio album by the Avalanches. They started {{recording}} in 1999 and {{had used the}} working title of Pablo's Cruise. The duo primarily worked with a Yamaha Promix 01 and Akai S2000 <b>samplers.</b> The band's members, Darren Seltmann and Robbie Chater, spent hours sampling music from vinyl records to create the songs on the album: Chater estimates that there are over 3,500 samples. After sampling and arranging, the pair would swap their tapes, listen to each other's ideas and expand on whatever they had heard. Despite working separately, both Chater and Seltmann had nearly identical studio set-ups.|$|E
5|$|The Mellotron {{became more}} popular after the Beatles used it on several tracks. It was {{subsequently}} {{adopted by the}} Moody Blues, King Crimson and Genesis, and became a notable instrument in progressive rock. Later models such as the M400, the best selling model, dispensed with the accompaniments and some sound selection controls {{in order to be}} used by touring musicians. The instrument became less popular in the 1980s due to the introduction of polyphonic synthesizers and <b>samplers,</b> despite a number of high-profile uses from Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and XTC.|$|E
5|$|Although tape <b>samplers</b> {{had been}} {{explored}} in research studios, the first commercially available keyboard-driven tape instruments were built and sold by California-based Harry Chamberlin. The {{concept of the}} Mellotron originated when Chamberlin's sales agent, Bill Fransen, brought two of Chamberlin's Musicmaster 600 instruments to England in 1962 to search for someone who could manufacture 70 matching tape heads for future Chamberlins. He met Frank, Norman and Les Bradley of tape engineering company Bradmatic Ltd, who said they could improve on the original design. The Bradleys subsequently met bandleader Eric Robinson, who agreed to help finance the recording of the necessary instruments and sounds. Together with the Bradleys and television celebrity David Nixon, they formed a company, Mellotronics, in order to market the instrument. Robinson was particularly enthusiastic about the Mellotron, because he felt it would revitalise his career, which was then on the wane. He arranged the recording sessions at IBC Studios in London, which he co-owned with George Clouston.|$|E

5|$|In 1970, {{the model}} M400 was released, which {{contained}} 35 notes (G–F) and a removable tape frame. It sold over 1,800 units. By the early 1970s, hundreds {{of the instruments}} were assembled and sold by EMI under exclusive licence. Following a financial and trademark dispute through a US distribution agreement, the Mellotron name was acquired by American-based Sound Sales. Streetly-manufactured instruments after 1976 were sold under the name Novatron. The American Mellotron distributor, Sound Sales, produced their own Mellotron model, the 4-Track, in the early 1980s. At the same time Streetly Electronics produced a road-cased version of the 400– the T550 Novatron. By the mid-1980s, both Sound Sales and Streetly Electronics suffered severe financial setbacks, losing their market to synthesizers and solid-state electronic <b>samplers,</b> which rendered the Mellotron essentially extinct. The company folded in 1986, and Les Bradley threw most of the manufacturing equipment into a skip. From 1963 until Streetly's closure, around 2,500 units had been built.|$|E

40|$|THE VALUE OF THE ISAACS ENDOMETRIAL CELL <b>SAMPLER</b> IN THE CYTOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF THE ENDOMETRIUM IS STUDIED IN 112 NON - ANAESTHETISED PATIENTS, 21 - 79 YEARS OLD. ENDOMETRIAL BIOPSY OR HYSTERECTOMY WAS PERFORMED IMMEDIATELY AFTER ENDOMETRIAL ASPIRATION. THE CYTOLOGICAL RESULTS ARE CORRELATED WITH THE HISTOLOGICAL ONES. THE MATERIAL IS INADEQUATE IN 6 OF THE 112 CASES, THREE OF WHICH(2, 7 %) CONCERN THE CYTOLOGICAL SPECIMEN AND THE REMAINING THE HISTOLOGICAL ONE. THESE 6 CASES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN OUR STATISTICAL RESULTS. DIAGNOSTIC AGREEMENT IN THE CYTOLOGICAL AND HISTOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT IS FOUND IN 102 OF THE 106 CASES (96, 2 %). CYTOLOGICAL AND HISTOLOGICAL DISAGREEMENT IS FOUND IN 2 OF THE 106 CASES (1, 9 %) WHILE IN OTHER 2 (1, 9 %) THERE IS ONLY PARTIAL AGREEMENT. IN 93, 8 % OF THESE CASES, NO COMPLICATION FROM THE USE OF THE ISAACS CELL <b>SAMPLER</b> IS NOTICED AND NONE IMPORTANT COMPLICATIONS ARE FOUND IN 6, 2 % OF THE CASES. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE TECHNIQUE OF ENDOMETRIAL ASPIRATION USING THE ISAACS CELL <b>SAMPLER</b> IS SIMPLE, HANDINESS, QUICK, COMFORTABLE, WITH EXCELLENT PRESERVATION OF THE CELLULAR MORPHOLOGY FOR ASSESSING THE ENDOMETRIAL STATE. THE METHOD CAN BE USED ON AN OUT - PATIENT OR PRIVATE PATIENT, WITHOUT ANY PREVIOUS TREATMENT OF THE WOMEN. THE SMEARS ARE FIXED AND STAINED USING THE PAPANICOLAOU METHOD. THE METHOD CAN BE USED FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF IRREGULAR MENSTRUAL CYCLE, INVESTIGATION OF STERILITY, RESPONSE OF ENDOMETRIUM TO TREATMENT AND FOR RESEARCHING PURPOSES.

25|$|Piston <b>samplers.</b> These <b>samplers</b> are {{thin-walled}} metal tubes {{which contain}} a piston at the tip. The <b>samplers</b> are {{pushed into the}} bottom of a borehole, with the piston remaining at the surface of the soil while the tube slides past it. These <b>samplers</b> will return undisturbed samples in soft soils, but are difficult to advance in sands and stiff clays, and can be damaged (compromising the sample) if gravel is encountered. The , developed by D. A. Livingstone, is a commonly used piston sampler. A modification of the Livingstone corer with a serrated coring head allows it to be rotated to cut through subsurface vegetable matter such as small roots or buried twigs.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work, PSI and GRS {{sensitivity}} analysis (SA) and uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods, SHARK-X and XSUSA respectively, are compared for reactivity coefficient calculation; for reference {{the results of}} the TSUNAMI and <b>SAMPLER</b> modules of the SCALE code package are also provided. The main objective of paper is {{to assess the impact of}} the implicit effect, e. g., considering the effect of cross section perturbation on the self-shielding calculation, on the Doppler coefficient SA and UQ. Analyses are done for a Light Water Reactor (LWR) pin cell based on Phase I of the UAM LWR benchmark. The negligence of implicit effects in XSUSA and TSUNAMI leads to deviations of a few percent between the sensitivity profiles compared to <b>SAMPLER</b> and TSUNAMI (incl. implicit effects) except for 238 U elastic scattering. The implicit effect is much larger for the SHARK-X calculations because of its coarser energy group structure between 10 [*]eV and 10 [*]keV compared to the applied SCALE libraries. It is concluded that the influence of the implicit effect strongly depends on the energy mesh of the nuclear data library of the neutron transport solver involved in the UQ calculations and may be magnified by the response considered...|$|R
