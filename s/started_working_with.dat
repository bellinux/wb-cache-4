5|$|Since the application, {{there had}} been a {{technological}} development within tramways. Barth <b>started</b> <b>working</b> <b>with</b> the plans, and proposed that the line be built as a light rail in its own right-of-way, {{similar to that of the}} Holmenkollen Line and the Røa Line on the west side of town.

The end of the line would have a balloon loop. After the revised plans were approved by the authorities, construction started in August 1914. Most of the works were finished in 1917.
