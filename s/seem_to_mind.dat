25|$|In {{fields and}} {{plantations}} of plants {{they do not}} like to eat, e.g., cereals or eucalyptus, the greater rhea can be a species quite beneficial to farmers. It will eat any large invertebrate it can catch; its food includes locusts and grasshoppers, true bugs, cockroaches, and other pest insects. Juveniles eat more animal matter than adults. In mixed cerrado and agricultural land in Minas Gerais (Brazil), R. a. americana was noted to be particularly fond of beetles. It is not clear whether this applies to the species in general but for example in pampas habitat, beetle consumption is probably lower simply due to availability while Orthoptera might be more important. The greater rhea is able to eat Hymenoptera in quantity. These insects contain among them many who can give painful stings, though the birds do not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind.</b> Sometimes, greater rheas will gather at carrion to feed on flies; they are also known to eat dead or dying fish in the dry season, but as vertebrate prey in general not in large quantities.|$|E

Grant did not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> and even told his wife Julia, [...] "I {{do not want to be}} here [...] another four years. I do not think I could stand it." [...] After Grant left the White House, he and his wife decided to use their US$85,000 of savings to travel around the world. A biographer from the New York Herald, John Russell Young, traveled with the Grants and documented their journey to exotic places around the world in a book later published called Around the World with General Grant. Young saw that Grant's popularity was soaring, as he was treated with splendid receptions at his arrival in Tokyo and Peking, China.|$|E
500|$|The Masked Avengers {{received}} a sudden burst of fame from the prank. They gave more than 300 interviews about the conversation, and were even flown to New York City by CBS {{to appear on}} The Early Show. In an interview, Marc-Antoine Audette and Sébastien Trudel said that they found it [...] "pretty disturbing to see that idiots like us can go through to a vice-presidential candidate", and claimed {{that they were just}} [...] "two stupid comedians with a bad French accent." [...] The Masked Avengers also admitted that the call was [...] "probably the biggest [...] we've ever done." [...] When recalling the experience, Audette said that [...] "once we [...] started making jokes, she didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind,</b> and she didn't seem {{to be aware of the}} fact we were making jokes", which according to Audette was when [...] "we were like 'Oh my God this [...] is gonna be long'". The duo also said that they weren't trying to make any political statements with the call, they just like to take high-profile people to task.|$|E
500|$|Naomi and Emily {{escape to}} the {{countryside}} later that evening and cycle to one of Emily's favourite places by a lake before sunset. After swimming in the lake, they light a campfire, and share a cannabis joint. An act of blowbacking the joint leads the two to share a kiss and they proceed to make love. Emily wakes up the following morning to find Naomi preparing to leave. She pleads with Naomi not to leave her a second time and tells her that she should accept {{that she needs to}} be loved. Naomi goes home to find Kieran in bed with her mother, and leaves for college, devastated. She sees her teachers rigging the election to prevent Cook from winning, and reveals this to the form when she is announced the winner. As his first presidential act, Cook starts a riot. In the ensuing chaos, Naomi forgives Kieran, encouraging him that if he likes her mother, he should tell her so. Naomi begins to have sex with Cook before she realises that it [...] "isn't right". Surprisingly, Cook doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind,</b> as he says that she must have a good reason not to follow through because she's clever. Naomi leaves, with her and Cook now sharing a better understanding of each other. That night, she visits Emily's house, but Emily refuses to open the door, not wanting Naomi to see her after she had been crying. They sit {{on opposite sides of the}} door, and Naomi admits that she does need somebody to love her. Emily offers her hand through the door's cat flap to Naomi, who finally reciprocates Emily's feelings.|$|E

500|$|Xhinovci {{has come}} to believe that he is Hitler reincarnated since he began {{dressing}} as the Nazi leader. He carries numerous pieces of Nazi paraphernalia around with him, including Nazi-era Reichsmarks, swastika-emblazoned buttons, scarves embroidered with swastikas and other Nazi imagery, as well as a copy of Mein Kampf. He has business cards featuring a swastika and the word [...] "Hitler" [...] printed in bold. Locals and peacekeepers alike do not <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> Xhinovci's Hitler impersonations, especially as many Kosovars are too preoccupied with the country's crippling poverty and rampant corruption to give his actions much thought. On the contrary, many passersby—including some NATO peacekeepers—stop and greet him with the Nazi salute. One local told Vice News: [...] "I have {{a lot of other things}} to worry about in my life. I might look at him if he walks by, but that's it." [...] Locals apparently believe that his way of earning a living [...] "shows great enterprise". [...] "People respect me," [...] Xhinovci explains. [...] "The young and old [...] men, women and children. Everyone greets me with [...] "Heil Hitler". Xhinovci's five daughters, referred to locally as [...] "Hitler's children", are not bothered by their father's Hitler impersonations. Xhinovci reportedly attends parent-teacher conferences dressed as Hitler and says that teachers and other parents do not mind his appearance. He says that every time he goes to pick his daughters up from school he is surrounded by children who want to talk with him and take pictures. [...] "Girls like to touch my face. They think it's a mask. They pull my hair and ask if they can kiss me on the face. When I'm out of the house with my family, people stop to talk to me. But my wife is not a jealous person—she doesn't mind." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{community}} of Stockton opposed filming in the area, as memories of Leigh's murder were still fresh {{and the details}} of the script were [...] "too close for comfort". When filmmakers arrived in Stockton in late August 1996, locations that had previously been reserved were suddenly no longer available. The local media treated them with hostility. Former Newcastle deputy mayor and Stockton resident Frank Rigby criticised the film during production, saying [...] "I would just love it to go away and so would everybody else." [...] Brian Joyce was also critical of the decision to film in the area, saying the filmmakers had to acknowledge the choice they had made in doing so. The situation was exacerbated by the filmmakers' denial that the film was specifically about Leigh, despite their choice of Stockton for filming. During production [...] in September 1996, Elfick told The Newcastle Herald that he was [...] "getting a bit bored" [...] of people mentioning Leigh's murder. While acknowledging that the comments were understandable, Elfick concluded, [...] "Unfortunately, that event happens all over Australia. We wanted to take the events of that murder and many other murders". He was also quoted in The Sydney Morning Herald as saying, [...] "The movie is bigger than the Leigh Leigh thing". Elfick hoped that people viewing the film would see it as a positive {{way of looking at the}} circumstances that led to Leigh's death, and that it would make people think and maybe stop something like that happening to someone in the future. Leigh's family were vehemently opposed to the film, saying that the filmmakers were [...] "feasting on an unfortunate situation", insensitively trivialising and exploiting her death, and portraying her negatively while doing so. One of Leigh's aunts wrote to The Newcastle Herald later that month, saying [...] "David Elfick doesn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> [...] free publicity even if it comes from the tragic and brutal assault, rape, and murder of a fourteen-year-old virgin, not as he called it: 'the Leigh Leigh thing which happens all over Australia.'" [...] Enright said that while Leigh's murder served as the inspiration, the completed film is about the way a small town reacts when one of its own members murders another.|$|E

He spoke as an orator in the tradition of Cicero, such as had not been seen since the beginning of the reign of Augustus. Rather than pleading cases like all 95 C.E. orators, he decided to take a more passive route to speak on how a sound rhetoric influences the education of the commons.|$|E

2500|$|Other friends, publishers, {{and acquaintances}} held {{different}} views of Highsmith. Editor Gary Fisketjon, who published her later novels through Knopf, said that [...] "She was very rough, very difficult...But she was also plainspoken, dryly funny, and great fun to be around." [...] Composer David Diamond met Highsmith in 1943 and described her as being [...] "quite a depressed person—and I think people explain her by pulling out traits like cold and reserved, when in fact it all came from depression." [...] J. G. Ballard said of Highsmith, [...] "The author of Strangers on a Train and The Talented Mr. Ripley {{was every bit as}} deviant and quirky as her mischievous heroes, and didn't <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>mind</b> if everyone knew it." [...] Screenwriter Phyllis Nagy, who adapted The Price of Salt into the 2015 film Carol, met Highsmith in 1987 and the two remained friends for the rest of Highsmith's life.
