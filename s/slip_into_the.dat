5|$|He used {{friends as}} models, {{most notably the}} painter Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863), who {{modelled}} for {{the figure in the}} foreground with face turned downward and one arm outstretched. Two of the raft's survivors are seen in shadow {{at the foot of the}} mast; three of the figures were painted from life—Corréard, Savigny and Lavillette. Jamar posed nude for the dead youth shown in the foreground about to <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea, and was also the model for two other figures.|$|E
5|$|Juha Vainio became {{interested}} in music and started socializing with musicians in the mid-1950s. The centre of jazz music in Kotka was the restaurant Fennia where performers including Keijo Laitinen and the cousin of Vainio's mother, Olli Miettinen played. Although Vainio was under-21 and classed as a minor, he managed to <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> restaurant where he presented his lyrics to the musicians and was occasionally allowed to play the piano. Vainio recalled that his friends remembered him as being always penniless. He started drinking more and more, often asking his friends for a drink.|$|E
5|$|A narrow quay passes {{under the}} old swivel section of the bridge from Waller's Quay to the marina. A well-worn {{handrail}} offers the pedestrian some protection against a <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> river. This rail has been known as the Duke's Rail since in 1897 the then Duke of York, later to become George V, paid a state visit to Ireland. The royal party travelled up-river from Portumna on the steamship Countess of Mayo. Disembarking at Waller's Quay, the Duke was received by Lord Rosse, the Lord Lieutenant of King's County. The party had to traverse the narrow quay under the bridge to get to Banagher Railway Station, and undoubtedly made good use of the Duke's Rail. The stretch of the Shannon from Portumna to Banagher was {{known for some time}} after as the Duke of York's Route.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} using a ball point within a writing {{instrument}} {{as a method of}} applying ink to paper has existed since the late 19th century. In these inventions, the ink was placed in a thin tube whose end was blocked by a tiny ball, held so that it could not <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> tube or fall out of the pen.|$|E

Nonetheless, they won promotion by beating West Bromwich Albion 1–0 in the final at the recently opened new Wembley Stadium. This denied the Baggies an immediate return to the Premier League, which would have meant all 3 relegated clubs from the previous season were promoted.|$|E

25|$|Yeovil began February with {{consecutive}} defeats first a 2–0 loss at {{home against}} Southend United, and then followed with a 1–0 loss away at Port Vale. On 14 February, a dramatic equaliser in the third minute of injury time gave rock-bottom Milton Keynes Dons a 1–1 draw against Yeovil. On 20 February, owner David Webb decided to step down as Yeovil's chief executive, and decided not to join the board of directors. A third defeat of the month saw Yeovil <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> relegation zone {{for the first time}} since September, as the club lost 2–0 away at Blackpool.|$|E

25|$|The Blue team {{delivered}} {{what became}} known as System 7 on May 13, 1991, but the Pink team suffered from second-system effect and its release date continued to <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> indefinite future. Some of the reason for this can be traced to problems that would become widespread at Apple, as time went on; as Pink became delayed and its engineers moved to Blue instead. This left the Pink team constantly struggling for staffing, and suffering from the problems associated with high employee turnover. Management ignored these sorts of technical development issues, leading to continual problems delivering working products.|$|E
25|$|Safe sex {{commonly}} {{involves the}} use of condoms (also known as male condoms), but female condoms, which give women more control during the safe sex practice, may also be used; both condoms keep semen from coming in contact with the vagina, which can also help prevent unwanted pregnancy. There is, however, little research on whether female condoms are as effective as male condoms at preventing STIs, and they are slightly less effective than male condoms at preventing pregnancy, which {{may be due to the}} female condom not fitting as tightly as the male condom or because it can <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> vagina and spill semen.|$|E
25|$|Channel-billed cuckoos are brood parasites; {{instead of}} raising their own young, they lay {{eggs in the}} nests of other birds. They are thought to form pair bonds for the {{duration}} of a breeding season. Their mating behaviour has been described as involving calling and gift-giving, with the male presenting items of food such as insects to the female. Pairs also work together in order to aid the laying of eggs in host nests; the male will fly over the nest in order to provoke the nest occupants into a mobbing response, whereupon the female will <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> nest and lay an egg. Alternatively the pair may work together by attacking an incubating bird, driving it off the nest and allowing the female to lay.|$|E

25|$|The knife must be {{minimally}} {{slightly longer}} than the neck but preferably at least 2 times {{as long as the}} animal's neck is wide, but not so long that the weight of the knife is deemed excessive. If the knife is too large, it is assumed to cause Derasah, excessive pressing. Kosher knife makers sell knives of differing sizes depending on the animal. Shorter blades may technically be used depending on the number of strokes employed to slaughter the animal but the normative practice today is that shorter blades are not used. The knife must not have a point. It is feared a point may <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wound during slaughter and cause Haladah, covering, of the blade. The blade may also not be serrated, as serrations cause Iqqur, tearing.|$|E
25|$|Watford's first league {{match was}} at home to Doncaster Rovers, a team who {{finished}} the 2008–09 season level on points with Watford. Mackay was banned from the match, due to a suspension from an incident in the previous season. Watford lined up in a 4–4–2 formation, with Tommy Smith playing as a striker, and Don Cowie and Jobi McAnuff as wingers. Scott Severin was playing his first competitive match for Watford, and fellow debutant Danny Graham scored the opening goal after 27 minutes, a close range finish from a Tommy Smith cross. This {{was followed by a}} headed equaliser from Doncaster's James Hayter ten minutes later. In the second half, Doncaster striker Dean Shiels had a shot which his manager felt had crossed the line. However, the referee deemed that it had not, and the match finished as a draw. Watford were defeated 2–0 at Sheffield United in their next league fixture, with Jamie Ward and Ched Evans scoring for the opposition. The result caused Watford to <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> relegation places for the only time of the season. Mackay expressed disappointment at his side for the goals they had conceded, and revealed that club was considering a transfer offer for Smith.|$|E

Maggie Roswell was given the role of Maude, Ned's loving wife, and became a regular cast member with this episode. She had previously played supporting parts in the show's first season. Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart, commented on Roswell's acting: [...] "Maggie has been blessed with a skill in creating one of the hardest things to create: the 'normal sound,' whatever that is. So she can easily <b>slip</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> gal next door [...]" ...|$|E

Suzuya and Maya, {{under the command}} of Shōji Nishimura, bombarded Henderson Field while the rest of Mikawa's force cruised around Savo Island, guarding against any U.S. surface attack (which in the event did not occur). The 35-minute bombardment caused some damage to various aircraft and facilities on the airfield but did not put it out of operation. The cruiser force ended the bombardment around 02:30 on 14 November and cleared the area to head towards Rabaul on a course south of the New Georgia island group.|$|E
