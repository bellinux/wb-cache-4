5|$|Dunderdale was the Progressive Conservative Candidate in the {{district}} of Fortune-Hermitage in the 1993 provincial election. Dunderdale ran against Liberal cabinet minister Oliver Langdon, and while <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not win the election she felt she had to send premier Clyde Wells a message about the way he was treating municipalities. In the 1995 Progressive Conservative leadership election Dunderdale served as co-chair of Lynn Verge's successful campaign.|$|E
5|$|A {{cheerleader}} at school, Lawrence {{also played}} softball, field hockey and basketball, which she {{played on a}} boys team that her father coached. She was fond of horseback riding while growing up and frequently visited a local horse farm. She has a damaged coccyx from being thrown off a horse. The actress has said that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be famous from an early age. When her father worked from home, she performed for him, often dressing up as a clown or ballerina. Her first acting assignment was {{at the age of}} nine with the role of a prostitute in a church play based on the Book of Jonah. For the next few years, she continued to take parts in church plays and school musicals.|$|E
25|$|She {{has often}} said that <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> become a monastic in the Buddhist {{tradition}} {{at some point in}} her life; she was just waiting for the right time. That time came in 2000 when she took early retirement from Thammasat University and received the bodhisattva's precept from the Fo Guang Shan order in Taiwan. In 2001, she took her sāmaṇerī ordination in Sri Lanka from R. Saddha Sumana Bhikkhuni and T. Dhammaloka Bhikkhu. In 2001, she was ordained a full bhikkhuni in Sri Lanka, the first Thai woman to be ordained in a Theravada monastic lineage, as Dhammananda. Her ordination lineage is Syamopali from Dambulla chapter. She currently resides at the Songdhammakalyani Monastery in the Muang District, Nakhonpathom province, Thailand. Since her ordination, Dhammananda has written more than 100 books, designed to educate the public about various issues related to Thai Buddhism, including the place of women.|$|E
60|$|LADY MOGTON [President W.P.F.L.] <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be of {{more use}} in Parliament {{than many of}} the men who are there; is {{naturally}} annoyed at the Law's stupidity in keeping her out.|$|R
60|$|But in accusing her suitor of want of judgment, she {{was quite}} in the dark as to his real course of action. <b>She</b> little <b>knew</b> with how {{profound}} a judgment he was managing his affairs. Had <b>she</b> <b>known,</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> hardly have interfered as she now did. As she put her foot on the step of the fly she desired her servant to drive to Montpellier Terrace.|$|R
50|$|Odile is restless {{because her}} father seldom praises her, even though (or perhaps because) she is growing {{to be his}} equal in magic. She has never seen {{much of the world}} outside her father's estate, but <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> like the company of other people. She has no {{interest}} in the swans because they seem to lack her intelligence, and because von Rothbart has taught her to despise them.|$|R
500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1846 Stone {{informed}} her family of her intention to become a woman’s rights lecturer. Her brothers were at once supportive, her father encouraged her {{to do what she}} considered her duty, but her mother and only remaining sister begged her to reconsider. To her mother's fears that she would be reviled, Stone said <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be disesteemed and even hated, but she must [...] "pursue that course of conduct which, to me, appears best calculated to promote the highest good of the world.” ...|$|E
500|$|Although her {{research}} was progressing at Missouri, McClintock was {{not satisfied with}} her position at the University. She recalled being excluded from faculty meetings, and was not made aware of positions available at other institutions. In 1940, she wrote to Charles Burnham, [...] "I have decided that I must look for another job. As far as I can make out, {{there is nothing more}} for me here. I am an assistant professor at $3,000 and I feel sure that that is the limit for me." [...] Initially, McClintock's position was created especially for her by Stadler, and might have depended on his presence at the university. McClintock believed she would not gain tenure at Missouri, even though according to some accounts, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be offered a promotion from Missouri in the spring of 1942. Recent evidence reveals that McClintock more likely decided to leave Missouri because she had lost trust in her employer and in the University administration, after discovering that her job would be in jeopardy if Stadler were to leave for Caltech, as he had considered doing. The university's retaliation against Stadler amplified her sentiments.|$|E
2500|$|Entwistle later {{played the}} role of [...] "Hedvig" [...] in Henrik Ibsen's The Wild Duck. After seeing the play, Bette Davis told her mother, [...] "...I want to be exactly like Peg Entwistle." [...] Some years later Broadway {{director}} Blanche Yurka sent a note to Davis asking if she would like to play Hedvig and she sent word back that ever since she had seen Entwistle in The Wild Duck, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> someday play Hedvig. Through the years Davis said Entwistle was her inspiration to take up acting.|$|E
60|$|Ethel <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> {{had said}} enough. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> miss the man {{if he went}} away, {{but it would be}} better for him and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never have more than his liking.|$|R
50|$|Year 1399: “... if {{she could}} be sure of having Henry, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{wait for him to}} the very end of her life, if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> die three days after the marriage.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I almost {{agree with}} her,' Wendy snapped. Fancy Wendy snapping. But {{she had been}} much tried, and <b>she</b> little <b>knew</b> what was to happen before the night was out. If <b>she</b> had <b>known</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not have snapped.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{never be}} much of a success as an {{elementary}} school teacher. But neither had she failed. She hated it, but she had managed it.|$|E
6000|$|Gyp {{would not}} think. If {{she thought of}} her little one crying, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> cry, too. But her hatred for those who had dealt this cowardly blow grew within her. She took a {{resolution}} and said quietly: ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{all this}} while his sister was pacing {{up and down}} the palace, hardly letting the knife out of her hand, and {{dreading}} what <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> see, and what she did see. The blade grew red before her eyes, and she said, 'Now it is my turn.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Crabbe? I {{never heard}} of him!" [...] she owned as boldly as before, for {{if he had been}} worth hearing of, <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have heard of him. [...] "Don't you like Kipling?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right," [...] Lord Nunneley declared. [...] "Olive did {{not know}} I was coming, but I'm sure if <b>she</b> had <b>known</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have sent her love. Don't bother to ring. I can find my way out." ...|$|R

60|$|She did {{not reveal}} these {{thoughts}} to Kirk because {{she was more than}} a little ashamed of them. A year ago, <b>she</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not have objected to the idea. A year ago such an expedition would have been a daily occurrence with her. Now she felt if William Bannister wished to feed squirrels, Mamie was his proper companion.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have {{to break}} her own trance of obstinacy. So she snuggled down into the bedclothes, {{shivering}} deliciously, for her skin had become chilled. She didn't care a bit, really, about her own downfall. She snuggled deliciously in the sheets, and admitted to herself that she loved him. In truth, she loved him--and she was laughing to herself.|$|E
60|$|Then, suddenly, after a fortnight, came an intimation from Kingston-on-Thames. She was {{to appear}} at the Education Office of that town on the {{following}} Thursday, {{for an interview with}} the Committee. Her heart stood still. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> make the Committee accept her. Now she was afraid, now that her removal was imminent. Her heart quivered with fear and reluctance. But underneath her purpose was fixed.|$|E
60|$|Bruce Carmyle {{attacked}} his {{roast beef}} morosely. Sally {{who was in}} the mood when <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be ashamed of herself later on, but was full of battle at the moment, sat in silence.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not {{be likely}} to speak. If <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> {{anything}} <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have said it at the trial had she not wished to shield this man, whom she may love {{in spite of his}} wickedness." ...|$|R
60|$|Margaret {{became quite}} animated, {{and her sisters}} pressed her to tell them if <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> of any secret; but she playfully shook her head, and said that if <b>she</b> did <b>know</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not mar the romaunt {{that was to be}} played out before them.|$|R
60|$|At {{break of}} day, {{the old woman}} ran to see her son, and found, as <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would,</b> a bunch of dead flowers in his hand. She next {{passed on to the}} bedside of the princess, who still lay asleep {{grasping}} the withered flowers. But she did not believe any the more that her guest was a man, and so she told her son. So they put their heads together and laid another trap for her.|$|E
60|$|Barbara {{let him go}} and followed. He {{looked very}} tired {{and she did not}} want to talk. She saw the {{stretcher}} carried up the hotel steps and along a passage, and then went to her room. A Spanish doctor and nurse were waiting and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be sent away. To feel she could not help was hard, but she tried to be resigned and stopped in the quiet room, listening for steps. Somebody might bring a message that Lister wanted her.|$|E
60|$|Clare {{turned her}} head, but {{except for this}} she did not move, {{and it was a}} relief when after a few disjointed remarks his voice died away. She was moved to pity, but for a few moments she had quivered in the grasp of another emotion. It was obvious that Dick did not {{altogether}} know what he was saying, but he had shown her plainly the place she had in his mind, and <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not like to lose it.|$|E
60|$|Her {{decision}} had been indicated in an instant, {{but it had been}} made after days and nights of anguished deliberation. <b>She</b> had <b>known</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be asked, <b>she</b> had decided what <b>she</b> <b>would</b> answer, and, without the slightest hesitation, she had moved her hand to the right.|$|R
50|$|A teacher, who is {{not happy}} with her job, pretends to be {{the ghost of a}} murder victim. Little did <b>she</b> <b>know</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> meet the real ghost, the actual murderer and a heroine. She finds a man who chases her.|$|R
60|$|The lady {{looked at}} him in {{speechless}} amazement. If <b>she</b> had <b>known</b> him <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have burst out laughing.|$|R
60|$|Farnam's hired man {{had driven}} {{across to the}} {{settlement}} {{in the afternoon and}} she wondered, rather anxiously, whether he would bring her a telegram. She had written to Thirlwell, telling him when she would be ready to begin her search for the ore, and now waited his reply. Her letter might take some time to reach him, and she must allow for his messenger's journey to the railroad from the mine; but <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> feel restless until the answer came.|$|E
60|$|It {{had become}} a habit, early in their friendship, for Stephen to ride or {{walk over to the}} {{windmill}} in the dusk of the evening when she felt especially lonely. On one such occasion she pushed open the outer door, which was never shut, and took her way up the stone stair. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> find her friend seated in the window with hands folded on lap, looking out into the silent dusk with that absorbed understanding of things which is holier than reverence, and spiritually more active than conscious prayer.|$|E
60|$|As it happened, he {{took her}} for a drive among the Stanley pines one mild {{afternoon}} a few days later, and though <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> regret his departure she was unusually friendly. Vane rejoiced at it, but he had already decided that he must endeavour to proceed with caution and content himself in the meanwhile with the part of trusted companion. For this reason, he chatted lightly, which he felt was safer, {{during most of the}} drive, but he once or twice responded without reserve when, by chance or design, she asked a leading question.|$|E
5000|$|This form has a future-in-the-past {{meaning in}} {{sentences}} such as <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> win the game.

6000|$|... "What is the matter?" [...] {{shouted the}} {{newcomer}} {{in the deep}} tones that the girl recognized as belonging to the black sergeant.
