2500|$|As a <b>shuttle</b> <b>boat,</b> the Andaste was {{commanded}} by Captain Albert L. Anderson of Sturgeon Bay. [...] A glacier-deposited mound {{of sand and}} gravel {{on the banks of}} the Grand River, at what is now the Bass River State Recreation Area twelve miles southeast of Grand Haven, yielded a steady stream of aggregate loads bound for Chicago. [...] On September 9, 1929, the Andaste lay alongside a Grand River dock, taking on another 2,000-ton load of Grand River aggregate. [...] Few noticed the workaday vessel, as she was a constant presence at working port quays like this one. [...] Late that evening she cast off and headed for Chicago. [...] The boat was logged by the Coast Guard as passing through the Grand Haven harbor piers at 9:03 p.m. [...] This brief notation in an official log book is the last verified sighting of the Andaste as a floating vessel.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1920s, {{there was}} a {{dramatic}} upsurge in demand by local governments and road districts for gravel, sand, and cement. [...] Outdoor construction materials were in high demand to build concrete-paved roads and highways for motor cars. This demand created {{a new lease on}} life for the old Andaste. Starting in 1928, the aging [...] "canaller" [...] was chartered to the Construction Materials Company of Chicago as a <b>shuttle</b> <b>boat</b> for aggregate construction materials. [...] The Company's dock and concrete plant, on the Calumet River in South Chicago, always needed more aggregate. [...] In addition, the Company had been hired as a contractor to the City of Chicago, which was building a broad parkway along its shoreline that required hundreds of thousands of tons of landfill sand. [...] The parkway that the Andaste was helping to build would become Chicago's Lake Shore Drive. [...] Although the Andaste was itself owned by Cleveland interests, the vessel rarely left the sand-and-gravel-rich basin of Lake Michigan.|$|E

50|$|A {{variety of}} {{watercraft}} {{operate on the}} reservoir. Vehicle ferries run frequently across the reservoir between docks in Linxia County (Lianhua Tai) and Yongjing County, providing a shorter and more pleasant route for travel between Linxia City and Liujiaxia Town than China National Highway 213 does. Recreational vessels and <b>shuttle</b> <b>boats</b> to Bingling Temple operate {{from a number of}} docks, in particular the one in Liujiaxia Town near the dam.|$|R

50|$|In the {{northern}} regions of Lombardy and Venetia, commuter ferry boats operate on Lake Garda and Lake Como to connect {{towns and villages}} at {{both sides of the}} lakes. The waterways in Venice, including the Grand Canal, serve as the vital transportation network for local residents and tourists.

5000|$|The {{first line}} was opened in 1934, which was Klampenborg-Copenhagen H-Vanløse-Frederiksberg, with more lines soon after. Most were {{converted}} from steam operated railways to electric, metro-like operation and stations. Today the network forms {{the heart of}} public transport in the city, serving more than 357,000 passengers a day. (Together with the Metro they serve more than 500,000.) The S-train is owned and run by DSB S-tog A/S. Similar to the S-Bahns of Berlin, Vienna and Hamburg, the S-train network covers the entire greater urban area.The system is complemented by the Copenhagen Metro, regional trains, local diesel-powered trains within Metropolitan Copenhagen, an extensive bus network and two lines of <b>shuttle</b> <b>boats</b> called [...] "harbour buses".

The start and end of the trail are both on State Highway 38.|$|E
50|$|In 1964, {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Don Laughlin, owner of the 101 Club in Las Vegas, flew over the site and saw its tourism potential. He offered to buy the land, and within a few years, the small motel and casino, {{consisting}} of only 12 slots and two live tables, was bustling. In 1966, the Riverside Resort built the first 14-floor high-rise; in 1972, 48 rooms were added, followed by several additions. A second casino, the Bobcat Club, opened in 1967, where the Golden Nugget Laughlin currently operates. In 1968, a third casino, the Monte Carlo, opened its doors. Across the river, Bullhead City, Arizona, flourished in the glow of the casino light. <b>Shuttle</b> <b>boats</b> transported customers from the Arizona side of the river to Laughlin's resorts and back.|$|R

2500|$|Lütjens was {{handicapped}} by {{the lack}} of firepower in the German navy. He authorised Ruge to organise the landings. The Advanced Detachments (Vorausabteilungen) were to storm the beach in battalion-strength. The following craft would clear mines allowing for artillery coasters and tugs carrying the Panzer units to follow unhindered. The smaller motor boats would unload engineers to clear obstacles and act as <b>shuttle</b> <b>boats</b> between the larger vessels and the beach. They would rush to and fro delivering army units to land in order to expand the beachhead and allow the flotilla to land its full complement. Lütjens recommended using the old battleships Schlesien and [...] as fire support to protect the crossing. Lütjens favoured beaching the ships on the Varne Bank to act as a gun-fire platform. He thought they could best act as strong points to deny passage through the Strait of Dover to the British. Raeder agreed but the plan was rubbished by technical experts who argued the old ships were too prone to capsizing and their stationary posture was too vulnerable and their armament too weak to do the job effectively.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the Civil War, King Philip {{was used}} as a {{dispatch}} <b>boat,</b> <b>shuttling</b> mail, supplies, and passengers between Washington, D.C. and Union ships on the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers.
