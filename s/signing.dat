Constructive <b>sign</b> system consists of symbolic <b>sign</b> system and non-symbolic <b>sign</b> system. Symbolic <b>sign</b> system is constituted on similarity to the event. Non-symbolic <b>sign</b> system consists of gestalt-qualitative <b>sign</b> system and molecule-synthetic <b>sign</b> system. Non-symbolic <b>sign</b> system is constituted on the next principle. Though there are difference between the <b>sign</b> system and the event system, while children consider the <b>sign</b> system and the event system as the same thing, they operate the <b>sign</b> system. Symbolic <b>sign</b> system is more readily learned as a <b>sign</b> in a child due to its similarity to the event system.
