Many of these related styles (animation, liquid, tutting, etc.) can not be traced to one person or group. Solomon states [...] "There are people who wave and there are people who tut.

In February 1883 Julius Dresser, a former patient of Quimby's, accused Eddy in letters to the Boston Post of teaching Quimby's work as her own. In response Eddy disparaged Quimby as a mesmerist and said she had experimented with mental healing in or around 1853, nine years before she met him. She wrote later: [...] "We caught some of his thoughts, and he caught some of ours; and both of us were pleased to <b>say</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> each other." ...|$|E

[...] In response, Bethmann Hollweg, now aware of the Russian order for partial mobilization, fired off several telegrams {{in the early morning hours}} of 30 July. At 2:55a.m., he telegraphed Vienna:"The refusal of every exchange of views with St. Petersburg would be a serious mistake, for it provokes Russia precisely to armed interference, which Austria is primarily concerned in avoiding. We are ready, to be sure, to fulfill our obligations as an ally, but we must refuse to allow ourselves to be drawn by Vienna into a world conflagration frivolously and in disregard of our advice. Please <b>say</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> Count Berchtold at once with all emphasis and with great seriousness." ...|$|E

2500|$|The duet {{part was}} {{and still is}} {{performed}} regularly on stage by Meat Loaf with his current featured female vocalist Patti Russo. However, with the passing years and the consequent greater maturity of both singers, their interplay during the coda has gradually taken on ironic overtones, if not overtly comedic ones, which were totally absent from the original album version. For example, in the 2007 show 3 Bats Live, after Russo sings [...] "After a while you'll forget everything, it was a brief interlude and a midsummer night's fling", Meat Loaf stops the band and asks her (half-sung, half-spoken): [...] "Why do you <b>say</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> me? Why do you keep saying these things to me every single night?", and she replies innocently (again half-sung): [...] "It's in the lyrics". More funny exchanges of the same kind occur during their other live duets, such as the famous Bat Out of Hell track [...] "Paradise by the Dashboard Light".|$|E
2500|$|For {{the third}} convention, the city hall in Syracuse, New York was {{selected}} as the site. Because Syracuse was nearer to Seneca Falls (two days' travel by horse, several hours' journey by rail), more of the original signers of the Declaration of Sentiments were able to attend than the previous two conventions in Massachusetts. Lucretia Mott was named president; at one point she felt it necessary to silence a minister who offended the assembly by using biblical references to keep women subordinate to men. A letter from Elizabeth Cady Stanton was read and its resolutions voted on. At sessions taking place September 8â€“10, 1852, Susan B. Anthony and Matilda Joslyn Gage made their first public speeches on women's rights. Ernestine Rose spoke denouncing duties without rights, saying [...] "as a woman has to pay taxes to maintain government, she has a right to participate in the formation and administration of it." [...] Antoinette Brown called for more women to become ministers, claiming that the Bible did not forbid it. Ernestine Rose stood up in response, saying that the Bible should not be used as the authority for settling a dispute, especially as it contained much contradiction regarding women. Elizabeth Oakes Smith called for women to have their own journal so that they could become independent of the male-owned press, saying [...] "We should have a literature of our own, a printing press and a publishing house, and tract writers and distributors, as well as lectures and conventions; and yet I <b>say</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> a race of beggars, for women have no pecuniary resources." [...] Antoinette Brown lectured about how masculine law can never fully represent womankind. Lucy Stone wore a trousered dress often referred to as [...] "bloomers", a more practical style she had picked up during the summer after meeting Amelia Bloomer. She spoke to say [...] "The woman who first departs from the routine in which society allows her to move must suffer. Let us bravely bear ridicule and persecution {{for the sake of the}} good that will result, and when the world sees that we can accomplish what we undertake, it will acknowledge our right." [...] The Syracuse Weekly Chronicle was impressed less by her costume than by her electrifying address, printing [...] "Well, whether we like it or not, little woman, God made you an ORATOR!" ...|$|E
