The portrayal of drivers ranges from the heroes of the 1950s, living a life of freedom on the open road, to the depiction of troubled serial killers of the 1990s. Songs and movies about truck drivers were first popular in the 1940s, and mythologized their wandering lifestyle in the 1960s. Truck drivers were glorified as modern day cowboys, outlaws, and rebels during the peak of trucker culture in the 1970s.|$|R

50|$|The term fleet media {{refers to}} the {{placement}} of advertisements on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>trucks,</b> vans, {{and other forms of}} transportation that form part of a commercial fleet. It entails more than the addition of a company logo, name and number to the vehicles belonging to that company. The crucial difference is that fleet media, like any other form of advertising, is commercially available. If it is possible to buy space on a retailer’s delivery fleet then this would be fleet media as a form of retail media. Equally if a delivery/logistics company were to sell advertising space on its delivery vans this would be fleet media.|$|R
50|$|Semi-{{automated}} side loaders use {{an automated}} mechanism to lift and dump manually aligned waste containers inside {{the main body}} <b>of</b> the <b>truck.</b> The primary difference <b>of</b> semi-automated <b>side</b> loaders is that they require more than one person, to operate the truck, and to manually bring and align containers to the loading hopper on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the <b>truck.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many {{different}} companies' names appeared silk-screened on the <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> Winross <b>trucks</b> {{through the}} 1970s; decals were never used. Examples were Ryder, McLean Trucking, Roadway, Coca-Cola, Caterpillar, Arkansas Best Freight, Quaker Oats, and Goodyear. Sometimes the individual factory or plant was identified {{on the truck}} as well.|$|R
40|$|Aerodynamic drag is {{the cause}} for {{more than two-thirds of}} the fuel {{consumption}} of large trucks at highway speeds. Due to functionality considerations, the aerodynamic efficiency of the aft regions of large trucks was traditionally sacrificed. This leads to massively separated flow at the lee <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>truck</b> trailers, with an associated drag penalty: roughly a third of the total aerodynamic drag. Active Flow Control (AFC), the capability to alter the flow behavior using small, unsteady, localized energy injection, can very effectively delay boundary layer separation. By attaching a compact and relatively inexpensive "add-on " AFC device to the back <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>truck</b> trailers (or by modifying it when possible) the flow separating from the truck trailer could be redirected to turn into the lee side of the truck, increasing the back pressure, thus significantly reducing drag. A comprehensive and aggressive research plan that combines actuator development, computational fluid dynamics and bench-top as well as wind tunnel testing was performed. The research uses an array of 15 newly developed suction and oscillatory blowing actuators housed inside a circular cylinder attached to the aft edges of a generic 2 D truck model. Preliminary results indicate that a net drag reduction of 10 % on full-scale trucks is achievable. 1. Scientific backgroun...|$|E

50|$|A mobile {{billboard}} is {{a device}} used for advertising on the <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a <b>truck</b> or trailer that is typically mobile.

40|$|AbstractAmong many safety {{applications}} enabled by Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC), {{truck platooning}} provides many incentives to commercial companies. This paper studies DSRC Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V 2 V) performance in truck platooning scenarios through real-world experiments. Commercial DSRC equipments and semi-trailer trucks {{are used in}} this study. We mount one DSRC antenna on each <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the <b>truck.</b> One set <b>of</b> dynamic tests and a few sets of static tests are conducted to explore DSRC behaviors under different situations. From the test results, we verified some of our speculations. For example, hilly roads can affect delivery ratio and antennas mounted on opposite <b>sides</b> <b>of</b> a <b>truck</b> can suffer from low delivery ratio at curved roads. In addition, {{we also found that}} antennas can sometimes suffer from low delivery ratio even when the trucks are on straight roads, possibly due to reflections from the nearby terrain. Fortunately, the delivery ratio can be greatly improved by using the two side antennas alternately...|$|R
