Higgins had made contact with socialite and philanthropist Teresa Castillo (Socorro Santiago), who he believed may be able to help him get inside the cartel. She gives Reed information leading him to the Magdalena safe house, where he chases down their leader, Rey (Paolo Andino). However, Rey turns out to be head of the Latin Lords, the main rival of the Magdalena Cartel; the Cartel was using Reed to take out their competition. Reed discovers Teresa's real name is Magdalena Rojas, and she runs the cartel. He arrests her, but she tells him she doesn't know who the mole is, only that as their information was always accurate, <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> is someone high up in the OCU.|$|E

While he told Eithne Power of TVTimes that he thought Frank and Bobby rushed into marriage without any [...] "proper understanding of each other".

Chrissie persuades her to abort the baby, and later reveals that <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> was Den's baby.

Chrissie plans to intimidate Den into signing the pub over to her. They confront Den but he takes it in his stride and openly talks about his sins, unaware that Sharon is hiding {{at the other side}} of the pub, listening to her father's confessions. Sharon berates Chrissie for tricking her into coming back to Walford with the lie that her father is ill. She storms out of the pub and Den follows. Chrissie knows that Sharon is the one person Den truly loves and cares about and knows that losing Den the love of his favourite child will destroy him. Den walks back in and she taunts him that he now knows what it is like to lose what he loves most. Unable to contain his rage, Den attacks his wife and hits her head against a fruit machine. Zoe picks up the nearest object (a metal, dog-shaped doorstop) and hits Den over the head with it and he falls to the ground. Perceiving him to be dead, Zoe and Sam go out the back to turn all the lights off and lock all the doors. A smug Chrissie starts to gloat that Den is dead, as if to say she has won. Den suddenly grabs her leg and hisses, [...] "You'll never get me out of the Vic." [...] so Chrissie picks up the doorstop and delivers a fatal blow to his head, secretly watched by Sam. The three women bury him in a hole in the pub's cellar, which is filled with cement the next morning.|$|E

Her Revel concerts were more Liza with a Z than MTV — predicated on nothing but the tour de force of its creator. Saturday night's two-hour show featured no gimmicks, no backing tracks, no hard-to-follow narratives, no whipped cream cannons. It was old school Vegas-style Entertainment with a capital E: singing, dancing, and charisma {{wrapped up in a}} few sparkly Ralph & Russo outfits." [...] Dan DeLuca of Philadelphia Inquirer praised Beyoncé's singing with earnest commitment and impassioned intensity further writing that the concert was a [...] "relentlessly entertaining, highly energetic two hours". Jim Farber of Daily News was positive about the show, praising the performance of the ballads as well as the up-tempo songs, adding that she was [...] "shimmying, sashaying and gyrating like she had everything to prove." [...] He further said, [...] "Beyoncé didn't shirk on the razzle or the dazzle in this two-hour event. In fact, this run of shows featured the flashiest lighting, fiercest dancing and most animated theatrics of her starry career... The assurance of the performance, as well as the enormity of the production, makes it unlikely that Beyoncé's latest show will die with this weekend." [...] Ben Ratliff of The New York Times commented that [...] "The show lasted two hours and allowed a dip in the middle for ballads, but otherwise ran rampant, functioning as an almost continuous high point". Celia L. Smith of Essence magazine wrote that, [...] "She sang, danced and put on a show like no other". A writer for Rap-Up noted that Beyoncé didn't miss a step during the choreography and added that [...] "Sasha Fierce is alive and well". Writing that she didn't disappoint, a journalist of Black Entertainment Television described the concert as [...] "phenomenal" [...] further praising the high-energy performance of her up-tempo songs and adding that she [...] "dazzled" [...] her fans. The journalist added that [...] "Though she made it look easy, keeping up to the beat of the vibrant tunes was no easy task" [...] and marked it as [...] " [...] pop queen's return to her throne". Dawn Fallik of The Wall Street Journal praised Beyoncé's dancing and voice during the show saying that they were in [...] "enviable form".

500|$|The {{original}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Paul Hunter, known {{for his work on}} previous Michael Jackson and TLC clips. However, for unknown reasons, the video was scrapped, and Hilson re-shot a clip for the video with [...] "Knock You Down" [...] and [...] "Number One" [...] director Chris Robinson. Robinson told Rap-Up, [...] "Keri Hilson has a great personality and is a real girl. That’s what we want to get across." [...] He also talked about the premise and plot of the video, stating that the video portrays Hilson as a woman who doesn't take herself seriously, commenting, [...] "It’s a really sexy song, but we don’t want to fall into the typical love, love, love R vibe with that... it starts where you think, ‘Oh, it’s about her and being sexy.' She’s in her house and by herself, and you kind of think it could be serious, but the song drops out in the middle and her friends catch her being all sexy, basically like, ‘What the f**k [...] are you doing? You are not singing by yourself.’" [...] In an interview with That Grape Juice, when asked about the video and on the sensuality of the live performances compared to video, Hilson responded, [...] "Yeah. It is a bit of that, but it’s a bit toned down for the video, because you got so much censoring, I can’t do everything I do on stage (laughs). So when people come out they’re probably still gonna be a bit surprised to see it live, after seeing the video. But I’m very pleased with the video. I love the colours and it’s reminiscent of the whole late 70s early 80s era in music." [...] Chris Brown, Omarion, Monica, Melody Thornton, and Polow Da Don all appear in the video. The video begins with Hilson, dressed lavishly, arriving late to a Jeep full of the previous stated people. The clip flips back to what happened earlier that night, showing Hilson getting ready in a seductive fashion, as she chooses perfume and picks out clothes. Scenes of Hilson performing in front of a leather-like wall are interspersed in between her and her friends riding down a boulevard to the club. Once she arrives to the club, she is attracted to a particular man, and subsequently performs elaborate, sensual choreography with him and other dancers, before slow dancing. VIBE said, [...] "Keri Hilson is fine as wine. You know it. We know it. And <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it.</b> But for the doubters, she proves it once again with this seductive new video from In A Perfect World." [...] A writer for Rap-Up said that Hilson, [...] "takes it nice and slow in the video for 'Slow Dance.'" [...] The video ranked at number 80 on [...] Top 100 Videos of 2009 countdown.|$|E

2500|$|There is also, however, a {{cultural}} dimension to anti-Americanism among religious and conservative {{groups in the}} Middle East. It may have its origins with Sayyid Qutb. Qutb, an Egyptian who was the leading intellectual of the Muslim Brotherhood, studied in Greeley, Colorado from 1948 to 1950, and wrote a book, The America I Have Seen (1951) based on his impressions. In it he decried everything in America from individual freedom and taste in music to Church socials and haircuts. Wrote Qutb, [...] "They danced to the tunes of the gramophone, and the dance floor was replete with tapping feet, enticing legs, arms wrapped around waists, lips pressed to lips, and chests pressed to chests. The atmosphere was full of desire..." [...] He offered a distorted chronology of American history and was disturbed by its sexually liberated women: [...] "The American girl is well acquainted with her body's seductive capacity. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>it</b> lies in the face, and in expressive eyes, and thirsty lips. She knows seductiveness lies in the round breasts, the full buttocks, and in the shapely thighs, sleek legs – and she shows all this and does not hide it".
