Over 4, 500 of these have been inventoried using multiple environmental variables, and analysis using GIS has helped to establish locational parameters. The results are being shared with tribal communities and state historic preservation offices, so as to provide better protection for these special places.

50|$|Cleaving usually begins {{from one}} end of a log, by driving the {{cleaving}} axe or a <b>splitting</b> <b>wedge</b> into the end of the log.

A short log may be split entirely {{from one end}}, a long log will require an initial split to be extended along the log by the use of axe or wedges, driven in from the sides. Short logs are cleaved vertically, long ones horizontally.|$|R

30|$|Evacuation of {{the joint}} haemarthrosis and of soft clot will enable the surgeon to {{identify}} the fracture fragments. The depressed segment should be elevated en masse from beneath and not by picking out individual articular fragments. The latter can render the assembly of tiny pieces {{of the joint}} surface utterly futile. The elevation of the depressed segment leaves a void in the subchondral metaphysis. There is some individual preference and debate about the choice of appropriate substitute to fill this defect. Autogenous corticancellous graft is still the benchmark although tricalcium phosphate and similar type bone substitutes have their appeal. Direct visualisation of accuracy of reduction is possible through the submeniscal exposure of the joint surface.

40|$|Key words: concrete; <b>wedge</b> <b>splitting</b> specimen; {{fracture}} toughness; {{stress intensity}} factor; crack extension Abstract. The <b>wedge</b> <b>splitting</b> (WS) test {{is now a}} promising method to perform stable fracture mechanics tests on concrete-like quasi brittle materials. Fracture parameters, such as fracture toughness and critical crack opening displacement and et. al, are however not easy to determined since formulae available from stress intensity factor manual are restricted to standard specimen geometry. The paper attempts to compute expressions for commonly used fracture parameters for a general <b>wedge</b> <b>splitting</b> specimen. By means of finite element analysis program, test simulation was performed on non-standard <b>wedge</b> <b>splitting</b> specimen with different depth and initiation crack length, and thereafter expressions were proposed for stress intensity factor at the pre-cast tip and crack mouth opening displacement on the load line. Based on the work above, size effect on the unstable fracture toughness and crack extension were investigated, and the consistency of fracture toughness data for various specimen depth as well as initiation crack length is demonstrated. The crack extension is little sensitive to the initiation crack length, it increases with the depth of specimen, which {{can be explained by}} the boundary influence of the specimen...|$|R

50|$|The hammer {{side of the}} maul {{is often}} used in wood {{splitting}} when combined with a <b>splitting</b> <b>wedge,</b> driving the wedge into the wood {{in the same fashion}} as the maul itself. This is generally used when attempting to split logs with a large diameter. Modern mauls are made of a strong enough steel to withstand the metal-to-metal contact without chipping. However, it is still common for the wedge itself to chip off. This can be dangerous as flying chips of steel could damage the eye. This is also the easiest way to break a maul's handle because the wedge is a very small target as opposed to the whole log, and can be overshot, resulting in the handle hitting full-force onto the wedge. This greatly weakens the handle, and can cause it to break after only a few over-shots.|$|R

5000|$|Circa 1803, {{according}} to William Pattee's History of Old Braintree and Quincy (1878) Josiah Bemis, George Stearns, and Michael Wild developed a splitting method similar in concept to the plug and feather method. This technique for <b>splitting</b> <b>stone</b> (referred to by modern researchers as the [...] "Flat Wedge Method") entailed cutting slots {{in a shallow}} line into the stone using a cape chisel struck with a large hammer. Small, flat metal wedges were then driven between shims made of sheet iron. The method of feathers and plugs began to be employed around this time, and spread rapidly throughout the region. Evidence of <b>stone</b> <b>split</b> with both methods indicate the evolution of this technique. The method using the cape chisel created long rectangular slots, whereas the newer method, using a plug drill, left round holes.|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the current state the non-blasting monolith extraction technology was conducted. The further research direction was substantiated. Has been considered and justified the rational parameters of close-set drilling technology of dimension stones. Solution is offered that consist the combined drilling (a close-set and a holes line drilling), that provides to increase of <b>stone</b> <b>splitting</b> efficiency under its own weight. The calculation of {{the parameters of the}} scheme of partial underdrilling at a monolith of stone with the purpose of reducing the volume of drilling works is given. Diagrams of tensile stress changes depending on the specific area of splitting were built. A rational correlation between the drilling parameters of the holes has been established by solving the problems of loading the cantilever beam and stress concentration by the Kirsch solution. The most important parameter for the implementation of this technology is the ratio of monoloth hight to its length. Engineering formulas are proposed for calculating the technological parameters of the realization of the “gravitational-hole” <b>stone</b> <b>splitting.</b> The configuration of a rough block of stones is determined under which this technology can be realized. Creating of close-set holes provides the increase of maximal tensile stress with equal values of specific splitting area ratio.
