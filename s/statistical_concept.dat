She was refused permission to audit lectures unofficially. Boltzmann advised her to appeal, which she did, successfully. On July 17, 1876 Ludwig Boltzmann married Henriette; they had three daughters and two sons. Boltzmann went back to Graz {{to take up the}} chair of Experimental Physics. Among his students in Graz were Svante Arrhenius and Walther Nernst. He spent 14 happy years in Graz and it was there that he developed his <b>statistical</b> <b>concept</b> of nature.|$|E

2500|$|A {{key issue}} for the statisticians is when {{first-class}} cricket for their purpose is deemed to have begun. Writing in 1951, Roy Webber argued {{that the majority of}} matches prior to 1864 (i.e., the year in which overarm bowling was legalised) [...] "cannot be regarded as first-class" [...] and their records are used [...] "for their historical associations". This drew a line between what was important historically and what should form part of the statistical record. Hence, for pre-1895 (i.e., in Great Britain) cricket matches, [...] "first-class" [...] is essentially a <b>statistical</b> <b>concept</b> while the historical concept is broader and takes account of historical significance. Webber's rationale was that cricket was [...] "generally weak before 1864" [...] (there was a greater and increasingly more organised effort to promote county cricket from about that time) and match details were largely incomplete, especially bowling analyses, which hindered compilation of records. According to Webber's view, the inaugural first-class match should have been the opening game of the 1864 season between Cambridge University and MCC at Fenner's on 12 and 13 May, Cambridge winning by 6 wickets.|$|E
2500|$|Grace {{regarded}} the South Wales matches as first-class fixtures and refers {{to them in}} his Cricketing Reminiscences as [...] "really big" [...] games. He was supported in his view by Lillywhite's Guide to Cricketers (1865 edition) which included his innings at Hove in a list called Scores of 100 or more made since 1850 in first-class matches; Grace's score {{was one of only}} six that exceeded 150. First-class status is a <b>statistical</b> <b>concept</b> and was never fully defined until an International Cricket Council (ICC) ruling in May 1947, but this does not apply retrospectively. Despite Grace's own views on the matter, his [...] "first-class career record" [...] was effectively created by F. S. Ashley-Cooper who produced a list of season-by-season figures to supplement Grace's obituary in the 1916 edition of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. These figures {{came to be known as}} Grace's [...] "traditional" [...] career record and granted him 126 first-class centuries, a total beaten by Jack Hobbs in 1925; it was not until Roy Webber's researches in the 1950s that Ashley-Cooper's list was challenged.|$|E
