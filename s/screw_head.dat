2500|$|Some stemwind 1857 {{movements}} were {{fitted with a}} screw {{which could be used}} to lock the winding click into the [...] "off" [...] position to allow the mainspring to be let down.

2500|$|Each {{of the six}} centre pieces pivots on a screw (fastener) held by {{the centre}} piece, a [...] "3D cross". A spring between each <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> and its {{corresponding}} piece tensions the piece inward, so that collectively, the whole assembly remains compact, but can still be easily manipulated. The screw can be tightened or loosened to change the [...] "feel" [...] of the Cube. [...] Newer official Rubik's brand cubes have rivets instead of screws and cannot be adjusted.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pocket holes}} require two {{drilling}} operations to be completed. The {{first is to}} counterbore the pocket hole itself, which houses the <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> within the member. This hole is stopped 1/4" [...] (5mm) or so {{from the edge of}} the frame member. The second step is to drill a pilot hole concentric with the pocket hole which extends through the edge of the member. The pilot hole allows the screw to pass through the member and into the adjoining member. This two stage drilling operation may be performed with two different sized drill bits, however there are special stepped bits available to perform the operation in a single pass. The drilling operation is often facilitated by a pocket hole jig which allows the user to drill the pocket hole at the correct angle and to the correct depth.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{possible}} to fit the bridge either way round on the two body posts, {{which leads to a}} certain amount of confusion when changing strings, should the bridge fall off. Conventionally, the string length (intonation) adjustment <b>screw</b> <b>heads</b> of the older [...] "Vintage" [...] bridge face the neck, and the <b>screw</b> <b>heads</b> of the newer [...] "Nashville" [...] bridge face the stopbar. Unless the player wishes to completely reset the action and intonation, it is important to refit the bridge in the same orientation as before a string change, regardless of which way round it was to start with.|$|R
50|$|More {{arrangements}} are possible. Two nuts {{can be fixed}} to each of two objects to be adjusted and the two <b>screw</b> <b>heads</b> attached {{to each other in}} the middle. The combined screws would be turned to adjust the spacing in that case.|$|R

50|$|In {{the modern}} era, cheaper plastic items often attempt to mimic more {{expensive}} wooden and metal products, {{though they are}} only skeuomorphic if new ornamentation references the original functionality, such as molded <b>screw</b> <b>heads</b> in molded plastic items.

An occiput attachment has a first end slideably engaged to the central part and a flat, straight second end that extends radially outwardly relative to the first end. First and second polyaxial <b>screw</b> <b>heads</b> are adapted to be implanted in first and second occipital condyles {{of a patient}}, respectively.

5000|$|Disadvantages {{include the}} time taken to strip a wire and, in basic terminals, {{properly}} wrap it around a <b>screw</b> <b>head,</b> {{since it is}} essential that any wire installed under a <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> be [...] "wound" [...] in the correct direction (usually clockwise,) so that the conductors are not forced outwards when the screw is tightened. This procedure is more time consuming than using a plug-in connector - thus making screw connections uncommon for portable equipment, where wires are repeatedly connected and disconnected.|$|E

50|$|By design, Torx head screws resist cam-out {{better than}} Phillips head or slot head screws. Whereas Phillips heads were {{allegedly}} designed {{to cause the}} driver to cam out, to prevent overtightening, Torx heads were designed to prevent cam-out. The development of better torque-limiting automatic screwdrivers for use in factories allowed this change. Rather than rely on the tool to slip out of the <b>screw</b> <b>head</b> when a desired torque level is reached (which risks damage to the driver tip, <b>screw</b> <b>head,</b> and/or workpiece), torque-limiting driver designs achieve a desired torque consistently.|$|E

50|$|However, {{with the}} {{clamping}} plate type of screw terminal {{this time is}} reduced, since it is necessary only to insert the stripped wire between the terminal and the rear clamping plate then tighten the connection, using the screw to clamp the wire between the terminal and the clamping plate, without any need properly to wrap it around the <b>screw</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
