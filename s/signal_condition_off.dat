40|$|Two {{experiments}} were completed allowing albino rats {{to choose between}} signaled and unsignaled reward conditions. These experiments examined the effects on preference of (1) response dependent versus response-independent reward and, (2) food pellets versus chocolate milk as the reward. All subjects preferred the <b>signaled</b> <b>condition</b> over the unsignaled condition, whether exposed to response-dependent, or to response-independent delivery of rewards. Preference was controlled most effectively by presenting both the signal itself and the correlated stimulus identifying the <b>signaled</b> <b>condition.</b> The <b>signal</b> presented alone (Extinction 3) controlled preference more effectively than did the stimulus correlated with the <b>signaled</b> <b>condition</b> (Extinction 2). The second experiment showed {{that the quality of}} the reinforcer (pellets and chocolate milk) did not affect preference for signaled reward since all subjects preferred the <b>signaled</b> <b>condition</b> at levels comparable to those observed in Experiment 1, with food pellets. These results, along with others, argue against species differences, response-dependency, and reinforcer quality as variables affecting the direction of preference...|$|R
40|$|Pigeons chose between 5 -s and 15 -s delay-of-reinforcement alternatives. The first key peck {{to satisfy}} the choice {{schedule}} began a delay timer, and food was delivered {{at the end of}} the interval. Key pecks during the delay interval were measured, but had no scheduled effect. In Experiment 1, <b>signal</b> <b>conditions</b> and choice schedules were varied across conditions. During unsignaled conditions, no stimulus change signaled the beginning of a delay interval. During differential and nondifferential <b>signal</b> <b>conditions,</b> offset of the choice stimuli and onset of a delay stimulus signaled the beginning of a delay interval. During differential <b>signal</b> <b>conditions,</b> different stimuli were correlated with the 5 -s and 15 -s delays, whereas the same stimulus appeared during both delay durations during nondifferential <b>signal</b> <b>conditions.</b> Pigeons showed similar, extreme levels of preference for the 5 -s delay alternative during unsignaled and differentially <b>signaled</b> <b>conditions.</b> Preference levels were reliably lower with nondifferential signals. Experiment 2 assessed preference with two pairs of unsignaled delays in which the ratio of delays was held constant but the absolute duration was increased fourfold. No effect of absolute duration was found.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} whether {{choosing a}} <b>signalled</b> shock <b>condition</b> over an unsignalled one {{is controlled by}} a stimulus that predicts the presence of shock (Experiment I), or by a stimulus that predicts the absence of shock (Experiment II). The dependability of these stimuli as predictors of either the presence or the absence of shock was parametrically varied over a wide range, and subjects (rats) were given an option to change from an unsignalled to a <b>signalled</b> <b>condition.</b> In the first experiment, all shocks were preceded by signals; however, {{the probability of a}} signal being followed by shock varied from 1. 0 to 0. 02. The data obtained indicate that the dependability of the signal as a predictor of shock is unimportant. Rats changed to the <b>signalled</b> <b>condition</b> when the <b>signal</b> was completely dependable (all signals followed by shock) and when the dependability of the signal was systematically degraded. In the second experiment, all signals were followed by shock; however, some shocks were not preceded by a signal.

40|$|There {{has been}} a {{continuous}} increase in the demands for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers {{in a wide range}} of applications. More and more wireless and mobile devices are equipped with built-in GNSS receivers; their users’ mobility behavior can result in challenging <b>signal</b> <b>conditions</b> that have detrimental effects on the receivers’ tracking and positioning accuracy. A major error source is the multipath signals, which are signals that are reflected off different surfaces and propagated to the receiver's antenna via different paths. Analysis of the received multipath signals indicated that their characteristics depend on the surrounding environment. This paper introduces a machine-learning pattern recognition algorithm that utilizes the aforementioned dependency to classify the multipath signals’ characteristics and identify the surrounding environment. The identified environment is utilized in a novel adaptive tracking technique that enables a GNSS receiver to change its tracking strategy to best suit the current <b>signal</b> <b>condition.</b> This will lead to a robust positioning under challenging <b>signal</b> <b>conditions.</b> The algorithm is verified using real and simulated Global Positioning System (GPS) signals with accurate multipath models...|$|R

40|$|The {{parameter}} estimation of Chirp signal model in additive noises {{when all the}} noises are independently and identically distributed (i. i. d.) has been considered. A novel iterative algorithm is proposed to estimate the frequency rate of the considered model by constructing the iterative statistics with one-lag and multilag differential signals. It is observed that the estimator for the iterative algorithm is consistent and works quite well in terms of biases and mean squared errors. Moreover, the convergence rate of the estimator is improved from Op(N- 1) of the initial estimator to Op(N- 3 / 2) for one-lag differential <b>signal</b> <b>condition</b> and from Op(N- 2) of the initial estimator to Op(N- 5 / 2) for multilag differential <b>signal</b> <b>condition,</b> respectively, by only three iterations.

Different stimuli present during the 50 % terminal links signaled food or blackout outcomes under <b>signaled</b> <b>conditions</b> but were uncorrelated with outcomes under unsignaled <b>conditions.</b> In <b>signaled</b> <b>conditions,</b> most pigeons displayed a nearly exclusive preference for the 100 % alternative when terminal links were short (5 or 10 s), but with terminal links of 30 s or longer, preference for the 100 % alternative was sharply reduced (often to below. 5). In unsignaled conditions, most pigeons showed extreme preference for the 100 % alternative with either short (5 s) or longer (30 s) terminal links. Thus, pigeons' choice between reliable and unreliable reinforcement is influenced by both the <b>signal</b> <b>conditions</b> on the unreliable alternative and the duration of the terminal-link delay.
