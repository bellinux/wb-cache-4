40|$|<b>Saltwater</b> <b>culture</b> of Myrothecium verrucaria, {{separated}} from a Spongia sp. collected in Hawaii, {{was a source}} of three new trichothecenes, 3 -hydroxyroridin E (1 a), 13 ′-acetyltrichoverrin B (2), and miophytocen C (3) and nine known related compounds (1 b, 4, 5, 6, 7 a, 7 b, 8, 9 a, and 9 b). The stereostructures of the new compounds were established on the basis of 1 D and 2 D NMR spectral analyses and a chemical transformation. At the same time, the stereostructures of known compounds, 1 b, 4, and 5 reported previously were also elucidated. All the compounds except 3 showed significant cytotoxicity against murine and human tumor cell lines. Moreover, the structure-activity relationships (SARs) were established from the results of the bioassay data...|$|E
40|$|The <b>saltwater</b> <b>culture</b> of a Penicillium chrysogenum strain {{isolated}} from the Mediterranean sponge Ircinia fasciculata yielded three new sorbicillin-derived compounds (1 - 3), whose structures were elucidated mainly by 2 D NMR and mass spectrometry. Among them, sorbicillactones A (1) and B (2) are the first sorbicillinoid natural products that contain nitrogen. Compound 1 is anti-HIV active and it exhibits a strong cytotoxic activity against L 5178 y leukemic cells, combined with a relatively low toxicity to cervical carcinoma HeLa S 3 cells and pheochromocytoma PC 12 cells. The absolute configurations of I and 2 were elucidated by quantum chemical calculation of circular dichroism (CD) spectra. Another compound isolated, sorbivinetone (3), might be an artifact derived from sorbicillinol (4) by Diels-Alder reaction with ethyl vinyl ether. Furthermore, the known sorbicillinoid fungal metabolites oxosorbicillinol (5), sorbicillin (6), and bisvertinolone (7) were identified, {{as well as the}} alkaloids meleagrine and roquefortine C. The biosynthetic origin of sorbicillactone A (1) from acetate, alanine, and methionine was investigated by feeding experiments with C- 13 -labeled precursor...|$|E
40|$|Algae are {{a diverse}} group of organisms {{generally}} categorised as either macroalgae (i. e. seaweed), or microalgae, which are typically unicellular. Algae are the bottom of the food chain in all aquatic ecosystems and there are an estimated 25, 000 microalgae species, with only around 15 in current commercial use. This primarily untapped resource produces an estimated 5000 tonnes of commercial biomass each year, which is valued at almost USD 1. 5 billion annually. Commercial algae systems to date produce human food, non-human food, neutraceuticals, biomass, biofertiliser, and also environmental remediation and monitoring applications. Algae can also produce other valuable substances in either fresh or <b>saltwater</b> <b>cultures,</b> including proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and pigments. Most commercially produced algae today is marketed as health food, although integrated industrial algal production offers multiple economic development opportunities. Algae technology can provide the biological platform to integrate carbon sequestration, bioenergy, biomass production, and water nutrient removal technologies. While algal biotechnology is still in its infancy, this emerging industry has the potential to revolutionise nutrition, agriculture, aquaculture, pharmaceutical and biofuel biotechnology. However, there is much research and development investment required before algae production systems to reliably and efficiently realise such benefits. This discussion paper explores algal biological capacity, in addition to technological developments in relation to species and strain selection, production, harvesting and extraction, refining, and commercial consumption...|$|R
40|$|Great Salt Lake-biotype brine shrimp cysts {{were added}} to 440 - 1 <b>saltwater</b> <b>cultures</b> {{maintained}} at 20 °, 25 °, and 30 ° C. A micronized corn-byproduct was added each day as food. Planktonic bacteria found during growth of the brine shrimp were enumerated on Plate Count Agar (Difco). From the 25 ° and 30 ° brine shrimp cultures, a total of seven prevalent bacterial types (five gram-negative and two gram-positive) were isolated from throughout the 12 -day growth cycle. Eight antimicrobial agents were tested against these bacteria, with chloramphenicol the most effective antibacterial agent overall, followed by erythromycin and carbenicillin. The bacterial density of the culture medium upon cyst addition was 106 colony forming units (cfu) /ml. The density increased similarly in all cultures from day 1 to day 3, and continued to increase in both the 25 °- and 30 °- cultures to between 108 and 109 cfu/ml {{at the end of}} day 12, at which time many brine shrimp had reached sexual maturity. However, the bacterial density in the 20 °- culture dropped after day 8, the culture medium became less turbid and the brine shrimp did not reach sexual maturity by day 11. Brine shrimp densities from 8 g of cysts were 2. 5 animals/ml (day 11) at 20 °, 3. 0 animals/ml (day 11) at 25 °, and 2. 7 animals/ml (day 12) at 30 °. Final wet weights from one data set were 5. 1 g/l at 20 °, 10. 2 g/l at 25 °, and 8. 5 g/l at 30 ° for 12 -day-old brine shrimp. The high initial and 1, 000 -fold increase in density of planktonic bacteria in both the 25 °- and 30 °- cultures was concomitant with significant accrual of Artemia franciscana biomass...|$|R
40|$|Amoeboid protists that harbor {{bacterial}} pathogens are {{of significant}} interest as potential reservoirs of disease-causing organisms in the environment, but {{little is known}} about them in marine and other saline environments. We enriched amoeba cultures from sediments from four sites in the New England estuarine system of Mt. Hope Bay, Massachusetts and from sediments from six sites in the Great Salt Lake, Utah. Cultures of amoebae were enriched using both minimal- and non-nutrient agar plates, made with fresh water, brackish water or <b>saltwater.</b> Recovered amoeba <b>cultures</b> were assayed for the presence of Legionella species using nested polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and primers specific for the genus. Positive samples were then screened with nested amplification using primers specific for the macrophage infectivity potentiator surface protein (mip) gene from L. pneumophila. Forty-eight percent (185 out of 388) of isolated amoeba cultures were positive for the presence of Legionella species. Legionella pneumophila was detected by PCR in 4 % of the amoeba cultures (17 out of 388), and most of these amoebae were growing on marine media. Our results show that amoebae capable of growing in saline environments may harbor not only a diverse collection of Legionella species, but also species potentially pathogenic to humans...|$|R
40|$|The {{push for}} {{alternatives}} to petroleum fuels has forced researchers {{to look for}} highly productive, renewable, non-food resources. The advantages of using microalgae instead of traditional oil crops for biofuel production include high oil yields, rapid reproductive rates, and versatile growing requirements. In {{order to reduce the}} cost of producing microalgae based biofuels, wastewater {{has been used as a}} nutrient source instead of specialized plant nutrients. The purpose of this study was to compare the relative effectiveness of different combinations of microalgae strain and dairy wastewater for increasing biomass. The methods for monitoring growth included optical density, cell counting, biomass estimation by chlorophyll-a, and volatile suspended solids. The analyses compared four concentrations of wastewater media as well as four strain treatments: Chlorella vulgaris, Tetraselmis sp., mixed freshwater culture and mixed <b>saltwater</b> <b>culture.</b> Optimum wastewater concentrations for microalgae growth were approximately 0 % and 25 % for most strain treatments. The results of the wastewater treatments concluded that dairy wastewater could serve as an effective nutrient substitute for plant food at concentrations approximately 25 %. Chlorella vulgaris and Tetraselmis sp. prevailed over the mixed cultures for biomass production. Nitrate was the most limiting nutrient and exhibited the greatest reductions, sometimes in excess of 90 %. The regression equations derived from the volatile suspended solids data achieved high R 2 values and determined that total nitrogen, ammonium, and nitrate were significant in the model. In those equations, increasing either ammonium or nitrate yielded an increase in volatile suspended solids. With regards to comparing biomass quantification methods, the two most useful and reliable biomass quantification methods were optical density and volatile suspended solids...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} thesis presents {{results from}} several investigations of marine natural products. It {{is divided into}} 5 chapters consisting of an introduction, three chapters examining the metabolites of tropical sponges. and a final chapter which discusses the chemical profile of a marine derived fungal culture. Chapter 1 is a brief survey {{of some of the}} most promising bioactive marine metabolites discovered to date. Furthermore, the first chapter includes some history and perspective pertaining to the field of marine natural products and natural products in general. Chapter 2 is an analysis of sponge metabolites derived from several Indo-Pacific collections of Diacarnus cf spinopoculum. A series of new terpenes of the nuapapuin class (norditerpene peroxides) and muqubilin class (norsesterterpene peroxides) were isolated, along with the new dinorditerpenone muquketone. When these and other related isolates were screened for in vitro cytotoxicity, the diterpenes nuapapuin A methyl ester and nuapapuin 8 displayed selective behavior and thus were selected for in vivo evaluation. Chapter 3 is divided into two parts both involving the processing of organisms which contained small alkaloids. Part I details the study of Clathria basilana from which no chemistry was previously published. Five specimens were examined, but only one was found to contain the unique quinolizine, clathryimine A. When heated, this compound gave rise to the degradation product clathryimine B. Part 2 describes the isolation of phenethylguanidine analogs, the dihydrotubastrines, from a zoanthid-infested specimen of Petrosia cf. comignata. The dihydrotubastrines are the first examples from this compound class with a saturated acyclic C 2 unit. Chapter 4 recounts the isolation of the new C 15 -ketosterol haliclostanone sulfate along with the fairly common sterol metabolite halistanol sulfate from a Haliclona sp. Interesting and rare features of the new sterol include the cis-C/D ring junction and the sidechain. Chapter 5 is a discussion of two vertinoid polyketides isolated from a <b>saltwater</b> <b>culture</b> of Trichoderma longihrachiatum procured from a marine sponge. The new metabolite epoxysorbicillinol is described, and its absolute stereochemistry is determined from CD exciton coupling. Furthermore, biosynthetic analysis is used to infer the absolute stereochemistry of the known vertinoid bislongiquinolide...|$|E
40|$|Freshwater, brackishwater, {{and marine}} {{ecosystems}} {{are recognized as}} distinct {{from each other and}} aquaculture is often conventionally categorized accordingly. However, the brackishwater aquaculture category is by no means universally recognized. China, India and Japan recognize only two categories: inland and marine aquaculture. Thailand and Vietnam, on the other hand, report production from brackishwater and marine aquaculture together under one category: coastal aquaculture. An examination of the species involved would show {{that there is such a}} wide overlap between so-called "brackishwater species" and "marine species" so that the two groups are virtually congruent with each other. Brackishwater species are euryhaline and can survive just as well in varying salinity levels and may also be raised and grown in full-strength seawater. So-called marine species, on the other hand, can tolerate slight dilutions in salinity and can be grown just as well in what are technically brackish waters. Furthermore, most, if not all, of the so-called brackishwater species invariably require marine waters for propagation. Thus, it would appear that the distinction between brackishwater and marine aquaculture is meaningless in categorizing aquaculture species. <b>Saltwater</b> <b>culture</b> of finfish in Southeast Asia may be characterized by low species diversity; sluggish industry growth, continued use and even dependence for some species on wild-caught seedstock, and heavy dependence either on fresh fish biomass or on fish meal for formulated feeds. There are only a few of finfish species or species groups that are now commercially raised in saltwater: milkfish, tilapia, grouper, and sea bass. Mangrove snapper and rabbitfish are to a certain extent aIready being cultured, but have not yet reached a significant proportion. Relative to other aquaculture commodities, particularly penaeid shrimps and seaweeds, the growth of saltwater fish culture in Southeast Asia has not been particularly spectacular. This is not for lack of market since there is a good intemational and local market for groupers. While milkfish and sea bass fry can now be commercially produced in hatcheries, commercial production of grouper fingerlings seedstock remains elusive, despite a long R & D history. There is an urgent need to develop cost-effective feeds with a greatly reduced requirement for fish protein for saltwater aquaculture...|$|E
