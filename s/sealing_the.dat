5|$|As suicide {{requires}} a willful attempt to die, some feel it therefore cannot {{be said to}} occur in non-human animals. Suicidal behavior has been observed in salmonella seeking to overcome competing bacteria by triggering an immune system response against them.

5|$|After Jones makes another {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt to}} open a doorway at a soccer field in Providence, Olivia searches through old case files related to science and unexplained phenomena, and discovers a geographic connection between the soccer field, the city street, and several of their past Fringe cases. Olivia and Walter {{come to the same}} conclusion, that Jones is going to use a site at Reiden Lake to reopen the doorway, the epicenter of these Fringe events. Olivia, Peter, and Walter intercept Jones while he is opening another window and is halfway through it. Peter triggers Walter's device, killing Jones by <b>sealing</b> <b>the</b> doorway.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} {{his mission to}} Muhammad Ali, Montefiore was returning to Europe by way of Constantinople. On October 15, 1840, in the Ottoman capital he {{had a meeting with}} Lord Ponsonby, to whom Montefiore suggested that following the precedent set by Suleiman the Magnificent, the sultan should issue a decree (firman) formally denouncing the blood libel and effectively <b>sealing</b> <b>the</b> cases both in Rhodes and in Damascus. The British ambassador was enthusiastic about the idea, and within one week he arranged for Montefiore a meeting with Reshid Pasha. Montefiore prepared a draft text of the firman and had its French translation read to Reshid Pasha, who responded encouragingly.|$|E

5|$|Group D, finally, was {{tasked with}} {{advancing}} south from its landing point to close off an escape route that ran between {{the sea and}} an inland lagoon towards the city of Hué. Landing at 04:30, the group made quick progress through the beach and dunes, secured the small city of Thé Chi Dong and hit the north coast of the lagoon by 05:30, thereby sealing off that escape route with no enemy contact. The final act of <b>sealing</b> <b>the</b> noose was to move some of the French Navy vessels north to the Vietnamese villages of Ba-Lang and An-Hoi where any attempt by Regiment 95 to flee by sea would have taken place.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} trials Sissoi Veliky {{was ordered to}} join the Mediterranean Squadron which was engaged in the naval {{blockade}} of Crete {{in the wake of}} the 1896 Cretan riots and the Hamidian massacres. Her maiden voyage revealed more problems; the lack of ventilation in the steering compartment was so appalling that during the first port call the captain purchased electric fans with his own money and the electrical systems failed one by one before reaching Gibraltar. The copper rings for <b>sealing</b> <b>the</b> portholes were left in Kronstadt and were not found until February 1897.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to this primary compression wave, other waves, known as harmonics, are created. Harmonics are caused by factors including the imperfect wobbling and shaking of the reed, the reed <b>sealing</b> <b>the</b> mouthpiece opening {{for part of the}} wave cycle (which creates a flattened section of the sound wave), and imperfections (bumps and holes) in the bore. A wide variety of compression waves are created, but only some (primarily the odd harmonics) are reinforced. These extra waves are what gives the clarinet its characteristic tone.|$|E

5|$|Instead of annexing Shishman's lands, Milutin reinstalled Shishman as the despot of Vidin and {{concluded}} {{an alliance with}} him. To confirm the alliance, Shishman married the daughter of Serbian Grand Prince Dragoš. The future marriage of Shishman's son and future Bulgarian emperor Michael Shishman (r. 1323–1330) to Milutin's daughter Anna Neda was also arranged at the time {{with the intention of}} further <b>sealing</b> <b>the</b> union. It is quite apparent that Shishman's unlikely reinstallment in Vidin and alliance with Serbia were dictated by Nogai, as at the same time Serbia also came under Tatar dependence. Milutin was even forced to send his son Stephen Dečanski into captivity in order to prevent a Tatar attack.|$|E
5|$|King George Vs active naval {{career was}} {{terminated}} by the Royal Navy in June 1950, {{when she and}} her sister-ships went into reserve and were mothballed. King George V was the first large warship to be preserved in this fashion. This involved <b>sealing</b> <b>the</b> armament, machinery and boilers against damp and installing dehumidifiers throughout. In December 1955, she was downgraded to extended reserve and in 1957 the decision was taken to scrap the four ships. The following year King George V was moved from her berth in Gareloch to the ship breaking firm of Arnott Young and Co. in Dalmuir to undergo dismantling.|$|E
5|$|Swordfishs diving {{depth and}} time {{are not known}} because the records from her sea trials have not survived. Shutting down her boiler, {{retracting}} the funnel and <b>sealing</b> <b>the</b> boiler uptake required about {{a minute and a}} quarter, which included switching over to the electric motors. In marked contrast to contemporary Vickers designs much attention was paid to safety arrangements, including her extensive subdivision. Indicator and telephone buoys, which could be released from inside the submarine were provided together with external air connections and a charged high-pressure line which could provide air to any manned compartment or the living spaces. Furthermore, the main ballast tanks could be blown from either end of the ship.|$|E

5|$|The Russian {{garrison}} on Corfu, augmented with {{a powerful}} naval squadron, effectively blocked French use of the Adriatic by <b>sealing</b> <b>the</b> entrance through the Straits of Otranto. French military concerns were also directed further north at this time, resulting in the War of the Fourth Coalition during 1806 and 1807 that saw Napoleon's armies overrun Prussia and force the Russians to sign the Treaty of Tilsit on July 7, 1807. One of the minor clauses of this treaty transferred the Septinsular Republic back into French hands, the Russians withdrawing completely from the Adriatic. This withdrawal supported a hidden clause in the treaty that guaranteed French support in the continuing Russian war with the Ottomans in the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|The early European {{economy of}} the Catlins during the 1830s and 1840s centred on whaling and <b>sealing.</b> <b>The</b> {{exploitation}} of the forests for timber started in the 1860s with {{the rapid growth of}} the city of Dunedin {{as a result of the}} goldrush of 1861–62. In the early 1870s more timber cargo was loaded at Owaka than at any other New Zealand port. Forestry and sawmilling declined in the late 1880s once the easily accessible timber had been removed. The extension of the railway beyond Owaka breathed new life into these industries, however, with activity peaking during the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} was {{cited by the}} AEC for violations of its reactor-operating license {{in connection with the}} incident, but none in direct connection to the immediate cause. The incident resulted in an investigation by the Nuclear Reactor Advisory Committee into its review processes for reactor experiments, after the AEC determined there was inadequate review of the UW experiment. The staff were praised by the AEC for their actions to avoid endangering the public, by <b>sealing</b> <b>the</b> materials and evacuating the building for six hours.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>seal</b> {{construction}} {{will consist}} of a sprung main sealing lip which has a point contact with the shaft. The point contact is formed by two angles, with the air side angle usually less than the oil side angle. Depending on <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> type these two angles are varied to create a pressure distribution at <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> contact point which has a steeper slope on the oil side of <b>the</b> <b>seal.</b> <b>The</b> shallower the slope on the oil side of <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> <b>the</b> wetter <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> will run. <b>The</b> spring is positioned such that axially the centerline of the spring is biased to the air side of the lip contact point.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Seal</b> of <b>the</b> State of Oregon is <b>the</b> {{official}} <b>seal</b> of <b>the</b> U.S. {{state of}} Oregon.

5|$|Trapping {{of newly}} emerged insects: By <b>sealing</b> <b>the</b> storage facilities, newly emerged adults from seeds could be {{prevented}} from escaping to their overwintering sites {{to decrease the}} pest pressure at the next season. B. rufimanus could then be trapped and later killed, e.g., by fire. Healthy and damaged seeds can be sorted using an optic sorter. Additionally, a storage extended over two years enables all developing B. rufimanus to emerge before sowing and therefore avoids emergence in the field from contaminated seeds.|$|E
5|$|After {{the path}} was {{finalized}} came the augers and drillers for the holes {{that served as}} foundations for the Vertical Support Members that held up the pipe. These holes were drilled and filled {{with a mix of}} water, gravel and dirt before a VSM was dropped into each hole. Because of the frozen ground, the gravel and dirt froze as hard as concrete, <b>sealing</b> <b>the</b> VSMs in place. The VSMs were laid in parallel, two at a time, and each had a semicircular rest for the pipeline segments. These were carried in 40-foot or 80-foot segments by crane or sideboom to the appropriate location, lowered into place, then welded together. The welds were then inspected via X-ray by quality control engineers who followed the welders.|$|E
5|$|Further {{light is}} shed upon Amenhotep's funerary cult by {{multiple}} documents which appear to detail the rituals dedicated to Amenhotep. Three papyri {{from the time}} of Ramesses II record the liturgy used by the priests, and reliefs at Karnak and Medinet Habu illustrate select rites and spells. The bulk of the rituals concern preparing for and conducting the daily offerings of libations for the idol, including a recitation of a ḥtp-dỉ-nsw formula, and purifying and <b>sealing</b> <b>the</b> shrine {{at the end of the}} day. The remainder of the rites concern how to conduct various feasts throughout the year. In these cases, Amenhotep's idol or a priest representing him is actually officiating the worship of Amun instead of being worshipped himself, which was not a typical cultic practice in ancient Egypt.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> true <b>seal</b> tribe Lobodontini, collectively {{known as}} <b>the</b> lobodontine <b>seals,</b> consist of four species of seals in four genera: <b>the</b> crabeater <b>seal</b> (Lobodon carcinophaga), <b>the</b> leopard <b>seal</b> (Hydrurga leptonyx), <b>the</b> Weddell <b>seal</b> (Leptonychotes weddelli), and <b>the</b> Ross <b>seal</b> (Ommatophoca rossii).
