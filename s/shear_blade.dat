40|$|ABSTRACT: Progressive and {{catastrophic failure}} in soils has been {{commonly}} associated with {{the phenomenon of the}} shear band propagation. This paper is an attempt to validate the energy balance approach to modeling of the propagation of a two-dimensional, circular shaped shear band. This shear band can be observed in a <b>shear</b> <b>blade</b> test, performed in the novel shear-blade apparatus. The simplified analytical solution obtained in this paper is based on the fracture mechanics energy balance and the limiting equilibrium approaches. FLAC has been chosen as a standard FD tool to explore and compare numerical with experimental and analytical approaches. Comparison of results from different approaches provides an insight into the complex domain of modeling shear band propagation in soils. ...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{method for}} {{designing}} a seven-bar linkage {{based on the}} optimization of centrodes is presented in this paper. The proposed method {{is applied to the}} design of a pure-rolling cutting mechanism, wherein close interrelation between the contacting lines and centrodes of two pure-rolling bodies is formulated and the genetic optimization algorithm is adopted for the dimensional synthesis of the mechanism. The optimization is conducted to minimize the error between mechanism centrodes and the expected trajectories, subject to the design requirements of the opening distance, the maximum amount of overlap error, and peak value of shearing force. An optimal solution is obtained and the analysis results show that the horizontal slipping and standard deviation of the lowest moving points of the upper <b>shear</b> <b>blade</b> have been reduced by 78. 0 % and 80. 1 % and the peak value of shear stress decreases by 29 %, which indicate better cutting performance and long service life...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the undrained shear strength, su, and overconsolidation ratio, OCR, of clay material (kaolin clay) is important in order to estimate the material strength for preparing the ground model for small scale physical modeling test. In this study, the {{relationship between}} these parameters is determined using a modified Rowe cell equipped with a vane <b>shear</b> <b>blade.</b> Kaolin samples were prepared under different consolidation ratios and the unit weight of kaolin is measured using the modified Rowe cell device, while the undrained shear strength, su, was determined using the vane shear apparatus. It was found that the values of the consolidation ratio, CR, were inversely proportionate to su. A correlation between su and OCR was established based on the laboratory results and validated with several previous studies. In addition, a comparison was made between the developed equation and some existing equations from the literature. It was found that the proposed equation provide a close prediction to the previous laboratory results with a Root Mean Square Error less than 1. 2. A difference arose due to the different types of clay used between previous and current studies. A positive relationship is established between the unit weight and OCR values for kaolin clay...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a sensitivity analysis on a numerical tidal stream turbine model where {{a multitude of}} input parameters' effect on the load output were determined. The statistical procedure used, known as the Morris method, provided insight into the interactions between the parameters as well as showing their comparative influence on the turbine loading. The investigation covered parameters from the operational, geometric design and inflow variable domains where the rotor radius, current <b>shear,</b> <b>blade</b> root pitch, surface velocity and wave height were identified as most influential. The blade pitch {{was regarded as a}} surprisingly prominent influence on the loads. The turbine's operating depth and the blade geometry were also found to be of limited influence in the ranges investigated. In terms of load transmission into the internal components of a turbine's drive train, the rotor out-of-plane bending moment, or eccentric bending moment, was found to be a considerable contribution to the off-axis loads on the shaft. Therefore, special attention was paid to the input parameters' relationship to the eccentric load component by performing a detailed study on the load variations caused by the identified primary input parameters. It is concluded that performing a sensitivity analysis on a tidal stream turbine in a specific operating climate can yield insight to the expected load range and that the eccentric loading transmitted to the shaft is significant for most input cases...|$|E
50|$|<b>Blade</b> <b>shearing</b> as a {{sport has}} been through some ups and downs since the 1980s {{but in the last}} 2 or three years, it has {{increased}} in popularity.

40|$|Meat {{tenderness}} {{is regarded}} as the single most important characteristic of meat quality. Fifty Bonsmara feedlot steers were fed a commercial feedlot ration (10, 5 MJ MElKg DM, 12 % CP), supplemented with 0, 15 mg Zilmaxlkg live weight in the feed and with different levels of vitamin D 3 (1 to 5 X 106 IU Vit D 3 /day) for five days prior to slaughter. The steers were randomly allocated to the vitamin D 3 treatments and a control group that received no vitamin D 3 supplementation. The steers were fed from ca. 248 ± 3 kg live weight, while Zilmax was fed for the last 35 days to a target weight of ca 400 kg. All steers were slaughtered at a commercial abattoir after a Zilmax withdrawal period of 7 days. Samples from m. longissimuss lumborum were collected 24 h post-mortem for sheer force testing on an Instron apparatus equipped with a Wamer Bratzler <b>shear</b> <b>blade.</b> Cooking loss was determined by measuring the amount of fluid loss after cooking. Feedlot performance, carcass characteristics and drip loss of meat samples did not differ significantly between the different vitamin D 3 treatments. The inclusion of 5 X 106 IU of vitamin. D 3 resulted in significantly lower shear force (SF) values compared to the steers in the control group. The results suggest that dietary supplementation of 5 X 106 IU of vitamin. D 3 may significantly improve the tenderness of meet from steers fed 0, IS mg Zilmax ®/kg live weight for the last 35 days in the feedlot. The aim of the second study was to explore the effectiveness of the use of electrical stimulation on tenderness of mutton. In this experiment 22 wethers of class AB weighing between 45 and 50 kg were used. The carcasses were assigned to two treatment groups, of which group one was electrically stimulated (ES) and the other group was not electrically stimulated (NES). The results revealed that electrical stimulation did not significantly affect of the fatty acid content of meat and crude fat content. Treatment however, significantly (P< 0, 038) influenced the moisture content of the samples. There was a variation in SF values between the two treatment groups; SF of samples from the ES group were lower compared to that of the NES group. This suggests that ES can be successfully applied to reduce the variation in tenderness within the class- AB mutton. Dissertation (MSc(Agric) : Meat Science) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.

Five semicontinuous Druhm runs were made with 1 / 2 -in. thick MgO liners and terminated due to either failures of the UF/sub 6 / nozzle or a top gasket leak. In preliminary scale-up tests of the flame calcination equipment, a maximum feed rate equivalent to 720 g oxides/hr was achieved using a 3 -in. i. d. magnesia reflector with an outside wall temperature of 1500 ction prod- C. In a test with a light water feed, 99 % Cu, 25 % Ni, and 0 % Mn were removed from a UO/ sub 2 /SO/sub 4 / solution by electrolysis with a mercury cathode in 7800 ampere hours. The effect of varying the total sulfate concentration on the kinetics of the absorption of uranyl sulfate on Dowex 21 K at a uranium concentration of 0. 005779 M and a sulfuric acid concentration of 0. 020 M was studied {{in a series of}} runs using a stirred bath containing enriched uranium. Chloride was removed to 64 ppm in Yankee Atomic and to 70 ppm in APPR solvent extraction feeds using a reference Darex flowsheet with air sparging during a two hour reflux period in the 10 -in. prototype titanium feed adjustment tank. Soluble uranium contained in a filter cake deposited onto a 20 micron porous metallic star shaped filter from approximately twenty-one liters of Darex solvent extraction feed solution was recovered to 99. 9 % by a single 5 liter water wash of the cake. An experimental Redox solvent extraction program was completed. <b>Shear</b> <b>blade</b> evaluation tests have begun at Birdsboro and Clearing under subcontract and will be completed by July 1.
