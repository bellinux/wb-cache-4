40|$|The wax {{crystallization}} in the <b>solvent</b> <b>dewaxing</b> {{is complicated}} process since it involves multi components flow with phase change of dissolved hydrocarbonates which solidified as wax crystals. In this study, an estimation mathematical {{model of the}} real <b>solvent</b> <b>dewaxing</b> unit was implemented.

The transport equations were solved numerically to obtain the wax crystal size distribution, wax volume fraction along the pipeline of the heat exchanger and chiller in a <b>solvent</b> <b>dewaxing</b> process. Experimental measurements were conducted using Differential Scanning Calorimeter to analysis the dissolved temperature, onset crystallization temperature and the wax content. The results measurement results were used as the main input parameters to the model for the Crystal Size Distribution (CSD) prediction in <b>Solvent</b> <b>Dewaxing.</b> The developed numerical model was proved to be capable to predict wax crystallization characteristics for different operating conditions of such complex process...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} <b>solvent</b> <b>dewaxing</b> {{is to prevent}} corrosion, protect {{catalyst}} in subsequent processes, and improve finished products by removing unsaturated, aromatic hydrocarbons from lubricant and grease stocks. The <b>solvent</b> <b>dewaxing</b> process separates aromatics, naphthenes, and impurities from the product stream by dissolving or precipitation. When powerful ultrasound of higher frequency is applied to a system, {{it is possible to}} produce physico chemical changes in organic solvent mixture. The ultrasonic velocity and density measurement has been undertaken in presence of high intense ultrasonic beam at 3 MHz in binary mixture of MIBK with toluene. The <b>solvent</b> <b>dewaxing</b> process is discussed in terms of molecular interaction by calculating acoustic parameters and their deviated values. The variation of different acoustic parameter with temperature and concentration shows the effect of ultrasonic wave in dewaxing process of crude oil...|$|E

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{excellent}} resistance {{to a range}} of solvents, integrally skinned polyimide membranes have been used to achieve selective separations in a range of solvent-based industrial and lab-scale chemical operations. These include: homogeneous catalyst recycle, petrochemical <b>dewaxing,</b> <b>solvent</b> exchange and chiral resolutions. However, despite the widening scope of use of these membranes, there is still little understanding of how the microstructure defines their separation performance. As a first step towards determining this, integrally skinned nanofiltration membranes were fabricated by phase inversion using Lenzing P 84 polyimide. The microstructures of these membranes, dry and wetted in solvent, were investigated by SEM, TEM and ESEM (where appropriate). SEM and TEM imaging of dry membranes revealed that this type of polyimide membrane has three microstructurally distinct polyimide layers, not the two indicated in prior literature. Furthermore, TEM images reveal nano-sized pore-like features in the polyimide structure, which indicate that the transport mechanism is probably neither only solution-diffusion nor only pore flow. ESEM imaging showed that when saturated in ethanol at the working pressure of the ESEM (5. 50 Torr), the microstructure of the membranes changes; it is wispy and thus quite different to the more solid polymer nodules and interconnected polymer network observed in the dry membranes. Thus, transport and separation mechanisms based on the structure of the dry membranes may not be accurate. Overall, these results indicate that the current theory used to describe polyimide membrane mass transfer and separation performance (where it is based on dry membrane microstructures), most likely needs to be rethought...|$|R
40|$|The turbine {{technology}} improvements from 1980 onwards have considerably increased {{mechanical and}} thermal stresses on turbine oils which, cause oil oxidation and thereby turbine oil degradation (Livingstone et al., 2007; Sasaki & Uchiyama, 2002). If the oil degradation problem is ignored, this {{might result in}} serious turbine system erratic trips and start-up operational problems (Overgaag et al., 2009). Oil oxidation by-products, in other words, sludge and varnish contaminants, lead stated turbine operation-tribological problems. Hence, sludge and varnish presence in turbine oil become {{a major reason for}} declining turbine reliability and availability. In the power generation industry, heavy-duty gas turbines as well as steam turbines have been lubricated with mineral based turbine oils for many decades (Okazaki & Badal, 2005). First, generally Group I oils (mineral base oils produced by <b>solvent</b> extraction, <b>dewaxing)</b> were used. Nevertheless, this group of oils has lower oxidation resistance. Therefore, modern gas turbines demand oils which have better oil oxidation resistance, and lower sludge and varnish contaminants tendency (Hannon, 2009). Today, there are many turbine lubricants available on the market. Besides Group I oils, more and more Group II oils (mineral base oils produced by hydro cracking and hydro treating) are selected in service, and having increased oil oxidation resistance. However field inspections demonstrate that Group II oils also experience sludge and varnish problems as well as Group I oils. Primary reason for these phenomena is the antioxidant additive packages that are used in Group II oils (Overgaag et al., 2009). In any case with recent oil formulations, oil degradation products still exist in current turbine oils, {{and will continue to do}} so in natural process. These sludge and varnish contaminants are less than 1 micron in size. Thus, they can pass turbine oil system standard mechanical filters without obstruction. With regard to keep the turbine systems in best operational conditions, external turbine oil cleaning practices became crucial to remove these less than 1 micron size oil degradation products from turbine oils. Current effective method for removing the sludge and varnish is to use electrostatic oil cleaners (Moehle & Gatto et al., 2007). Since the majority of turbine user and operator population have been shifted to use Group II based oils to counter the increased sludge and varnish problems, traditional oil cleaners became insufficient to remove sludge and varnish from Group II. (Due to Group II oils have different oil characteristics such as oil oxidation stability and solvency capability). With this awareness, thesis project is looking for ways to introduce and develop an Advanced Electrostatic Oil Cleaner to increase the availability and reliability figures of heavy-duty gas turbines against the rising amount of oil degradation products in modern formulated turbine oils. ECC (Electrostatic Cooled Cleaner) is an electrostatic oil cleaner device to clean and cool mineral based turbine oils for heavy-duty gas turbine applications by removing the sludge and varnish - oil contaminants from turbine oils. The basic principle of the ECC is based on the electrostatic force produced by parallel positioned electrodes which are charged with a high D. C. voltage. Oil contaminants- sludge and varnish have polar nature. Therefore, they are attracted by electrostatic forces whose intensity is proportional to the voltage applied. With the oil flowing in parallel to these electrodes, the polar particles in the oil (which is only neutral /no polar) are caught by filter media positioned between these electrodes. Small investments on advanced oil cleaner result in big savings on turbine system performance. Increased turbine availability and reliability predominantly reduce maintenance costs and risks besides, and thus maximizing revenue by extending heavy-duty gas turbine operational life. An introduced prototype of the ECC-D 4 model was tested using two Group II and one Group I oils. The amounts of 200 liter (each) test oils were circulated approximately 300 times through the ECC-D 4. In each 3 oil cleaning test sessions, it is proved that the oil insolubles content decreased approximately 40 % in tested turbine oils within about 240 ECC-D 4 operating hours. With taken base of heavy-duty gas turbine characteristics such as 400 MW power production capacity, annually 8000 operating hours, and 15000 liter oil reservoir volume; it is estimated that the ECC-D 4 can extend the oil service-life from 24000 to 48000 operating hours (which is approximately the oil service end-life). In addition to that, assuming the ECC-D 4 investment cost as 30 k€, about 15 k€ savings per year through the new turbine oil and component replacement costs, besides turbine operation profit losses. Moreover, the ECC-D 4 returns on investment with a rate of 39 % for defined heavy-duty gas turbine. In general perspective of ECC-D 4, it makes heavy-duty gas turbine infrastructure innovative, fully integrated and committed to fulfilling the need for clean, efficient, reliable power production practices in an environmental manner. ...|$|R
