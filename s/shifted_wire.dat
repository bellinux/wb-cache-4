This trend creates problems for Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) operators as the ever-increasing traffic loads [1] {{can no longer be}} handled efficiently with today's technology. Moreover, the wireless medium has its own challenges for supporting Quality of Service (QoS) sensitive services such as video streaming due to its fluctuating capacity. Thus, there is a demand for new solutions for the service providers and BWA operators to ensure the required level of QoS to their customers while providing them access to their favourite Internet services anytime and anywhere.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Today’s {{computer}} network is <b>shifting</b> from <b>wired</b> networks to wire-less networks. Several {{attempts have been}} made to assess the performance of TCP over wireless networks. Also, several solutions have been proposed to improve its performance. Many people believe SCTP would be replacement of TCP. However, the performance enhancement research for SCTP over wireless network is in beginning stage yet. In this paper we have measured performance characteristics of SCTP, and compared with ones of TCP and TCP-snoop over wireless network. After this experiment, we found the performance of SCTP is better than TCP, but worse than TCP-snoop. To improve the performance of SCTP over wireless network, we modified SCTP code by adopting TCP-snoop approach. We named it SCTP-snoop. With this SCTP-snoop, we experi-mented again, and found that it showed the best performance over wireless net-work among TCP, TCP-snoop, and SCTP. ...|$|R

This has allowed designers to replace the gear stick completely with either buttons, rotary knobs (current Jaguar and Range Rover models are good examples of this), or a miniaturized gear stick on the centre console. This can be seen in the Toyota Prius and some Audis, BMWs and the Lincoln Continental. Japanese finger shift is another example. It is a revival of an approach used in the 1950s by the Chrysler push button PowerFlite and the Packard Touchbutton Ultramatic.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} {{in the domain of}} network coding has promised a complete paradigm <b>shift</b> for <b>wired</b> and wireless networks. In case of wired networks, improvements in the network capacity especially magnify for multicast scenarios. For wireless networks, the inherent broadcast nature of the medium provides ample opportunities for intelligent mixing of the information. The two major benefits offered by this approach are: throughput improvements for the whole system and a high degree of robustness. In theory, the gains are guaranteed and vary form a few percent to several folds depending on traffic patterns, congestion levels and other network characteristics. A few recent practical system implementations have also validated the gains, but all of them trade with the complexity of this paradigm. This paper discusses {{the state of the art}} {{research in}} this domain- both from a theoretical and a systems perspective. We describe the manifold applications of this approach in different kinds of networks, with the associated degree of complexity and the practical considerations. We discuss how coding-aware schemes can provide energy and throughput gains for wireless networks. Finally we present some novel and interesting open problems which could be researched further in this field. 1...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe <b>shift</b> from <b>wired</b> to fully wireless communication is causing an increasing demand on the frequency spectrum. The cognitive radio {{was introduced to}} solve spectrum scarcity by allowing spectrum sharing between licensed and unlicensed users. This approach presents a challenge to source localization because of the cognitive radio’s capability to shift its spatial, frequency and temporal parameters. The extended semi-range-based (ESRB) and cooperative-received-signal-strength-based (CRSSB) localization schemes are proposed to overcome the challenge of identifying and locating a cognitive radio over time using a wireless sensor network. The objective of this thesis was {{to set up a}} testbed using GNU Radio and Universal Software Radio Peripherals (USRPs) to estimate the position of a cognitive radio device using the ESRB and CRSSB localization schemes. The ESRB algorithm does not provide accurate position estimates but the estimates are observed to be concentrated in the vicinity and converging toward the true position of the secondary user. The errors are believed to be caused by three factors: a limited number of sensor nodes used (four), an insufficient number of spectral scans per superframe (55), and the lack of synchronization among sensor nodes. The CRSSB localization scheme gave a more accurate position estimation. Captain, Tunisian Air Forc...|$|R

50|$|Aside from {{changes to}} the network (wires and {{switching}} and management) a well designed future-proof wireless network may not require much change at the endpoints. All equipment used in a wireless backhaul configuration supports simultaneous dual band communication (one band for user communication, another for the backhaul). Almost all such equipment also supports wired connections, typically using power over Ethernet or (less often in outdoor applications) unpowered Ethernet. So assuming reasonable software flexibility, both bands can be repurposed to user connectivity while the backhaul <b>shifts</b> to a <b>wired</b> connection. Unless nodes are entirely self-powered, they are connected at least indirectly to an AC or DC power source, suggesting that the single-cable solutions (power over Ethernet DC and IEEE P1901 AC) for both power and data should dominate for low-power shorter-range nodes, especially municipal Wi-Fi projects in low usage rural areas.|$|R

5000|$|Even {{small changes}} in the {{alignment}} of the grille over the phosphors can cause the coloring to <b>shift.</b> Since the <b>wires</b> are thin, small bumps can cause the <b>wires</b> to <b>shift</b> alignment {{if they are not}} held in place.

Screens 15" [...] and below have one wire located about two thirds of the way down the screen, while monitors greater than 15" [...] have 2 wires at the one-third and two-thirds positions. These wires are less apparent or completely obscured on standard definition sets due to larger scan lines of the video being displayed. On computer monitors, where the lines are much closer together, the wires are often visible. This is a minor drawback of the Trinitron standard which is not shared by shadow mask CRTs.|$|R
40|$|Linear DSP kernels such as {{transforms}} and {{filters are}} comprised exclusively of additions and multiplications by constants.

In this paper we present an automated method to generate, for a given linear transform, a minimum addition multiplierless implementation that satisfies a given quality constraint. The method combines automatic algorithm selection to improve numerical robustness and automatic search methods to minimize constant precisions in a chosen algorithm.

40|$|Wireless Communication Networks have {{attracted}} {{a lot of}} interest in the research community due to their potential applicability in a wide range of real-world practical applications. However, due to the distributed nature and their deployments in critical applications without human interventions and sensitivity and criticality of data communicated, these networks are vulnerable to numerous security threats that can adversely affect their performance. These issues become even more critical in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in which the sensor nodes have the capabilities of changing their transmission and reception parameters according to the radio environment under which they operate in order to achieve reliable and efficient communication and optimum utilization of the network resources. Recent development in the fields of wireless technologies have greatly benefited mankind, but rapid growth of these technologies have also contributed to unethical practices by individuals who are bent on using the technology to exploit others. Due to the low cost and convenience of deploying wireless networks, they have replaced wired networks in many fields of application. This <b>shift</b> from <b>wired</b> to wireless networks invalidates some established security concepts that rely on the physical inaccessibility of wired connections, as the nature of radio propagation makes it possible to attack wireless networks from outside the established perimeter protection. Such security issues have been increasing in number and complexity over the past few years. Hence there is a need to have comprehensive understanding of security issues and its countermeasures. The purpose of this survey is to do a comprehensive study of these issues in order to create awareness about the various types of threats and their mode of actions so that appropriate countermeasures can be initiated against such issue especially focuses on highly challenging Wireless ad-hoc network...|$|R

However, legacy {{technologies and}} networks {{are not likely to be}} replaced soon, the different wireless and wired communication and information infrastructures will co-exist and will have to work, seemingly seamless, together. The here documented research work delivers basic mechanisms supporting this integration, therefore a variety of technologies from different areas, ranging from Software Radio technology to Object-Oriented computing, have been brought together to introduce reconfigurability to mobile communication networks. Distributed object computing technologies are evaluated and their application as signalling and support platforms for reconfigureable systems is shown in different examples. Other novelties are the introduction of a protocol for download of reconfiguration software, from various software sources, these sources include Smart Cards, wired outlets and Over-The-Air. Furthermore, an object-oriented framework for flexible, 'on-the-fly' protocol exchange has been developed; the mechanisms and architecture of this framework are described within this thesis. Combining protocol reconfiguration, software download and distributed platforms and focusing on control and management of reconfiguration have led to the design and definition of a reconfiguration management architecture.

However, steel cables act nonlinearly and inelastically because of friction between the wires they are made of. This work develops nonlinear models as function of time. These models describe the behaviour of spiral strands under axial expansion and torsion as well as under bending with small axial forces. First we analyse the constructive structure, the conditions of contact between the individual wires and the cinematics for strands undergoing axial expansion and torsion. The frictual conditions between the wires are covered by internal variables.

40|$|In {{the recent}} past, {{communication}} is predominantly becoming wireless {{which is a}} drastic <b>shift</b> from <b>wired</b> communication. Generally, the transmitted radio signal over a wireless channel is subject to more distortion, more interference and more noise than a signal over wired channel. In other words, the SNR of received signal over a wireless channel is comparatively lower compared to received signal over a wired channel. Hence, to recover original data from received signal, wireless communication systems {{have to be more}} robust and efficient in recovering original data. Wireless communication systems these days adopt efficient multi-carrier transmission technique such as OFDM in their transceivers. And majority of the commercial wireless standards are OFDM based. OFDM based wireless standards demand highly efficient baseband hardware in communication systems. The baseband hardware needs to meet stringent design parameters such as high speed, low power, low area, low cost, highly fexible and highly scalable. Modern wireless systems support multiple standards {{to meet the demands of}} end user application requirements. A wireless system while supporting multiple standards, should also satisfy performance requirements of those supported standards. Wireless transceivers based on SDR platform support multiple wireless standards. Meeting performance requirements of multiple standards is a challenge while designing baseband hardware. To design an efficient OFDM baseband hardware, it is necessary to efficiently design its performance critical component. FFT computation is one of the most performance critical component in an OFDM system. Designing FFT hardware to support multiple wireless standards while meeting the above specified performance requirements is a challenging task. In this thesis work a N-point scalable novel FFT processor architecture was proposed. A radix- 2 fixed point 16 -bit N-point scalable FFT processor was designed and prototyped using VHDL on an Altera Stratix V FPGA device 5 SGSMD 5 K 2 F 40 C 2. The processor was implemented targeting SDR platforms supporting multiple OFDM based wireless standards. The processor operates at a maximum frequency of 200 MHz and uses less than 1 % of hardware resources on the FPGA. It meets the performance requirements of OFDM based wireless standards such as IEEE 802. 11 a/g, IEEE 802. 16 e, 3 GPP-LTE, DAB and DVB-T.

40|$|With {{aggressive}} {{scaling of}} semiconductor manufacturing technology in recent decades, {{the complexity of}} integrated circuits has increased rapidly leading to multi-million gate chips that require over ten metal routing layers. At current and future technology nodes, semiconductor devices are connected by narrower and more resistive <b>wires,</b> <b>shifting</b> the performance bottleneck from gate delay to interconnect delay. These trends confound modern design technologies for timing closure and require major improvements in physical design automation to maintain the current pace of innovation in chip architecture. Modern VLSI design flows require considerable effort and time in physical layout, where transistor locations affect nearly all downstream optimizations during timing closure. However, despite impressive improvements developed in academia and industry during the last decade, state-of-the-art algorithms for placement leave room for improvement both in quality and speed. Additionally, mainstream wirelength-driven placement algorithms are not geared for optimizing various objectives that are required by advanced VLSI processes and design styles. Our research addresses new challenges in physical optimization by (i) identifying the necessary new objectives, constraints and concerns imposed by contemporary and future semiconductor technologies,(ii) integrating these objectives with the existing objectives and tools, and (iii) developing new computational techniques to enhance scalability and robustness. We present new algorithms and methodologies for placement optimization subject to various constraints. In particular, we develop a standalone wirelength-driven global placement algorithm to significantly improve quality of standard-cell locations and decrease runtime. This algorithmic framework was recently adopted in the industry and has been extended by several university groups to support multiobjective optimization. In addition, our research shows how to integrate routability analysis within placement optimization, which is becoming increasingly important at upcoming semiconductor technology nodes. Experimental {{results indicate that the}} produced placements are significantly easier to route. We further enhance wirelength-driven placement using a multilevel framework and novel combinatorial optimization techniques. To broaden the scope of placement optimization, we study the theoretical aspects of our placement algorithms,and develop a variety of extensions: to different interconnect models, macro placement, and timing-driven placement. Another such extension is a placement framework that significantly improves the handling of datapath designs...|$|R
