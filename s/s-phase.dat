25|$|When Rb {{has been}} {{phosphorylated}} many times, it dissociates from E2F. E2F {{is free to}} activate expression of <b>S-phase</b> genes. TIGAR can indirectly prevent a cell passing through the Restriction Point by keeping Rb unphosphorylated.|$|E
25|$|The human BOK {{promoter}} {{is activated}} by the overexpression {{of members of}} the E2F hand transcription factor family. Typically, these transcription factors are involved in the promotion of <b>S-phase,</b> so there might be a connection between Bok expression and cell cycle progression. Due to this regulation of Bok expression by the cell cycle, it was proposed that Bok sensitizes growing cells to stress-induced apoptosis.|$|E
30|$|The {{signals of}} most events {{detected}} in the previous sections were recognized only at Togi station. The relative hypocenter locations within each cluster to the reference events were estimated from S-P time differences. A correlation method using overlapping time windows was separately applied to P- and <b>S-phases</b> in the interpolated seismograms for each cluster. We used interpolated seismograms for reference events (E 2, E 4, and E 8) {{with a duration of}} 0.6 s, starting 0.05 s before the onsets of the respective P- and <b>S-phases.</b> The S-P times of each event in a given cluster differed by only 0.003 s indicating that the hypocenters of the events in each cluster were located within a 20 -m radius of each other. This analysis also showed that the hypocenters of E 7, E 8, and E 9 as well as the E 1 and E 2 hypocenters were all located at similarly proximal distances.|$|R

40|$|Isothiocyanates (ITCs) are {{degradation}} products of glucosinolates present in {{members of the}} Brassicaceae family acting as herbivore repellents and antimicrobial compounds. Recent results indicate that allyl ITC (AITC) has a role in defense responses such as glutathione depletion, ROS generation and stomatal closure. In this study we show that exposure to non-lethal concentrations of AITC causes {{a shift in the}} cell cycle distribution of Arabidopsis thaliana leading to accumulation of cells in <b>S-phases</b> and a reduced number of cells in non-replicating phases. Furthermore, transcriptional analysis revealed an AITC-induced up-regulation of the gene encoding cyclin-dependent kinase A while several genes encoding mitotic proteins were down-regulated, suggesting an inhibition of mitotic processes. Interestingly, visualization of DNA synthesis indicated that exposure to AITC reduced the rate of DNA replication. Taken together, these results indicate that non-lethal concentrations of AITC induce cells of A. thaliana to enter the cell cycle and accumulate in <b>S-phases,</b> presumably {{as a part of a}} defensive response. Thus, this study suggests that AITC has several roles in plant defense and add evidence to the growing data supporting a multifunctional role of glucosinolates and their {{degradation products}} in plants. © 2015 Åsberg, Bones and Øverby.

25|$|DNA {{replication}} is {{a tightly}} orchestrated {{process that is}} controlled {{within the context of}} the cell cycle. Progress through the cell cycle and in turn DNA replication is tightly regulated by the formation and activation of pre-replicative complexs (pre-RCs) which is achieved through the activation and inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks, CDKs). Specifically it is the interactions of cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases that are responsible for the transition from G1 into <b>S-phase.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another histone {{chaperone}} that {{associates with}} the replisome is Asf1, which {{interacts with the}} Mcm complex dependent on histone dimers H3-H4. Asf1 is able to pass newly synthesized H3-H4 dimer to deposition factors behind the replication fork and this activity makes the H3-H4 histone dimers available {{at the site of}} histone deposition just after replication. Asf1 (and its partner Rtt109) has also been implicated in inhibiting gene expression from replicated genes during <b>S-phase.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to cyclin dependent kinases {{a new round}} of replication is thought to be prevented through the downregulation of Cdt1. This is achieved via degradation of Cdt1 as well as through the inhibitory actions of a protein known as geminin. Geminin binds tightly to Cdt1 and is thought to be the major inhibitor of re-replication. Geminin first appears in <b>S-phase</b> and is degraded at the metaphase-anaphase transition, possibly through ubiquination by anaphase promoting complex (APC).|$|E
40|$|Seismic {{anisotropy}} {{across the}} Hikurangi subduction zone measured from shear-wave splitting exhibits strong lateral changes over distances of about 250 km. Teleseismic <b>S-phases</b> show trench-parallel fast polarisations with increasing delay times across the forearc and arc region. In the arc region, delay times reach up to 4. 5 s, {{one of the}} largest delay times measured in the world. Such large delay times suggest strong anisotropy or long travel paths through the anisotropic regions. Delay times decrease systematically in the backarc region. In contrast, local <b>S-phases</b> exhibit a distinct change from trench-parallel fast orientations in the forearc to rench-perpendicular in the backarc, with average delay times of 0. 35 s. In the far backarc, no apparent anisotropy is observed for teleseismic <b>S-phases.</b> The three different anisotropic regions across the subduction zone are interpreted by distinct anisotropic domains at depth: 1) In the forearc region, the observed "average" anisotropy (about 4 %) is attributed to trench-parallel mantle flow below the slab with possible contributions fromanisotropy in the slab. 2) In the arc region, high (up to 10 %) frequency dependent anisotropy in the mantle wedge, ascribed to melt, together with the sub-slab anisotropy add up to cause the observed high delay times. 3) In the far backarc region, the mantle wedge dynamic ends. The apparent isotropy must be caused by different dynamics, e. g. vertical mantle flow or small-scale convection, possibly induced by convective removal of thickened lithosphere. The proposed hypothesis is tested using anisotropicwave propagation in two-dimensional finite difference models. Large-scale models of the subduction zone (hundreds of kilometres) incorporating the proposed anisotropic domains of the initial interpretation result in synthetic shear-wave splittingmeasurements that closely resemble all large-scale features of real data observations across the central North Island. The preferred model constrains the high (10 %) anisotropy to the mantle wedge down to about 100 kmunder the CVR, bound to the west by an isotropic region under the western North Island; the slab is isotropic and the subslab region has average (3. 5 %) anisotropy, down to 300 km. This model succeeds in reproducing the constant splitting parameters in the forearc region, the strong lateral changes across the CVR and the apparent isotropy in the far backarc region, as well as the backazimuthal variations. The influence of melt on seismic anisotropy is examined with different small-scale (tens of kilometres) analytical modelling approaches calculating anisotropy due to melt occurring in inclusions, cracks or bands. Conclusions are kept conservative with the intention not to over-interpret the data due to model complexities. The models show that seismic anisotropy strongly depends on the scale of inclusions and wavelengths. Frequency dependent anisotropy for local and teleseismic shear-waves, e. g. for frequency ranges of 0. 01 - 1 Hz can be observed for aligned inclusions on the order of tens of meters. To test the proposed frequency dependence in the recorded data, two different approaches are introduced. Delay times exhibit a general trend of - 3 s/Hz. A more detailed analysis is difficult due to the restricted frequency content of the data. Future studies with intermediate frequency waves (such as regional <b>S-phases)</b> are needed to further investigate the cause of the discrepancy between local and teleseismic shear-wave splitting. An additional preliminary study of travel time residuals identifies a characteristic pattern across central North Island. Interpretation highlights the method as a valuable extension of the shear-wave splitting study and suggests a more detailed examination to be conducted in future...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{effort has}} been made to present optimum alloy designs of {{commercial}} 7175 and 7050 type alloys to be used in thick forgings with proper microstructures and properties. The effects of changing alloy constitutions, primarily [Zn+Mg+Cu] and Zn:Mg ratio, on the evolutions of the coarse equilibrium phases and age hardening response are investigated. As a result, equilibrium phases (M,T,S) are evolved depending on alloy constitutions and cooling rate following solutionizing. The formation of the T- and <b>S-phases</b> is effectively controlled in the novel alloys (dilute and with high Zn:Mg ratio). In the slow quench, the redesign promotes homogeneous precipitation of η-phases, leading to higher mechanical properties than conventional alloys. The novel alloys provide microstructural homogeneity and extended heating range, ensuring 7 xxx thick forging applications...|$|R

25|$|Vinca {{alkaloids}} {{are derived}} from the Madagascar periwinkle, Catharanthus roseus (formerly known as Vinca rosea). They bind to specific sites on tubulin, inhibiting the assembly of tubulin into microtubules. The original vinca alkaloids are natural products that include vincristine and vinblastine. Following {{the success of these}} drugs, semi-synthetic vinca alkaloids were produced: vinorelbine (used in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer), vindesine, and vinflunine. These drugs are cell cycle-specific. They bind to the tubulin molecules in <b>S-phase</b> and prevent proper microtubule formation required for M-phase.|$|E
25|$|Various {{cell cycle}} checkpoints are present {{throughout}} the course of the cell cycle that determine whether a cell will progress through division entirely. Importantly in replication the G1, or restriction, checkpoint makes the determination of whether or not initiation of replication will begin or whether the cell will be placed in a resting stage known as G0. Cells in the G0 stage of the cell cycle are prevented from initiating a round of replication because the minichromosome maintenance proteins are not expressed. Transition into the <b>S-phase</b> indicates replication has begun.|$|E
25|$|Binding of Cdc45 to {{chromatin}} {{depends on}} Clb-Cdc28 kinase activity {{as well as}} functional Cdc6 and Mcm2, which suggests that Cdc45 associates with the pre-RC after activation of <b>S-phase</b> cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). As indicated by the timing and the CDK dependence, binding of Cdc45 to chromatin is crucial for commitment to initiation of DNA replication. During S phase, Cdc45 physically interacts with Mcm proteins on chromatin; however, dissociation of Cdc45 from chromatin is slower than that of Mcm's, which indicates that the proteins are released by different mechanisms.|$|E

The S-P times for E 2 (and E 1) and E 4 of 0.7 – 0.8 s (see Fig. 2 and Table 1) indicate that the hypocentral distances between these events and the Togi station were around 5 km, according to empirical relationship by Omori (1899). Figure 4 shows a semicircle with a radius of 5 km marking the area within which E 2 and E 4 hypocenters likely occurred. Travel times indicate that E 2 and E 4 did not occur along the mainshock fault plane. The E 3 event may have occurred near the rupture plane according to its S-P time (1.1 s) as recorded by the Togi station.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an automatic shear wave splitting measurement tool {{and the results}} from its application to data recorded {{in the vicinity of}} Mt.

About 50 % of all <b>S-phases</b> lead to measurements of acceptable quality. Results obtained with this technique are reproducible and objective, but more scattered than results from manual measurements. The newly developed automatic measurement tool is used to measure shear wave splitting for previously analysed data and for new data recorded in 2003 - 2007. In contrast to previous studies at Mt. Ruapehu, we have a larger and continuous data set from numerous three-component seismic stations. No major temporal changes are found within the new data, but results vary for di erent station locations. ...|$|R

25|$|TIGAR {{activity}} can prevent cells progressing into S phase through a checkpoint known in humans as the restriction point. At {{the very start}} of G1 phase, a protein called retinoblastoma (Rb) exists in an un-phosphorylated state. In this state, Rb binds to a protein transcription factor E2F and prevents E2F from activating transcription of proteins essential for <b>S-phase.</b> During a normal cell cycle, as G1 progresses, Rb will become phosphorylated in {{a specific set of}} sequential steps by proteins called cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) bound to cyclin proteins. The specific complexes that phosphorylate Rb are cyclin D-cdk4 and cyclin E-cdk2.|$|E
25|$|Anti-metabolites are a {{group of}} {{molecules}} that impede DNA and RNA synthesis. Many {{of them have a}} similar structure to the building blocks of DNA and RNA. The building blocks are nucleotides; a molecule comprising a nucleobase, a sugar and a phosphate group. The nucleobases are divided into purines (guanine and adenine) and pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine and uracil). Anti-metabolites resemble either nucleobases or nucleosides (a nucleotide without the phosphate group), but have altered chemical groups. These drugs exert their effect by either blocking the enzymes required for DNA synthesis or becoming incorporated into DNA or RNA. By inhibiting the enzymes involved in DNA synthesis, they prevent mitosis because the DNA cannot duplicate itself. Also, after misincorporation of the molecules into DNA, DNA damage can occur and programmed cell death (apoptosis) is induced. Unlike alkylating agents, anti-metabolites are cell cycle dependent. This means that they only work during a specific part of the cell cycle, in this case <b>S-phase</b> (the DNA synthesis phase). For this reason, at a certain dose, the effect plateaus and proportionally no more cell death occurs with increased doses. Subtypes of the anti-metabolites are the anti-folates, fluoropyrimidines, deoxynucleoside analogues and thiopurines.|$|E
25|$|Experimental {{evidence}} {{also suggests}} that gene expression can oscillate with the period seen in dividing wild-type cells independently of the CDK machinery. Orlando et al. used microarrays to measure {{the expression of a}} set of 1,271 genes that they identified as periodic in both wild type cells and cells lacking all <b>S-phase</b> and mitotic cyclins (clb1,2,3,4,5,6). Of the 1,271 genes assayed, 882 continued to be expressed in the cyclin-deficient cells {{at the same time as}} in the wild type cells, despite the fact that the cyclin-deficient cells arrest at the border between G1 and S phase. However, 833 of the genes assayed changed behavior between the wild type and mutant cells, indicating that these genes are likely directly or indirectly regulated by the CDK-cyclin machinery. Some genes that continued to be expressed on time in the mutant cells were also expressed at different levels in the mutant and wild type cells. These findings suggest that while the transcriptional network may oscillate independently of the CDK-cyclin oscillator, they are coupled in a manner that requires both to ensure the proper timing of cell cycle events. Other work indicates that phosphorylation, a post-translational modification, of cell cycle transcription factors by Cdk1 may alter the localization or activity of the transcription factors in order to tightly control timing of target genes.|$|E

We obtained fairly identifiable fundamental resonance frequencies in the range 0. 15 Hz to 2. 5 Hz. Receiver-side resonances were pronounced by stacking the H/V spectral ratio over many earthquake recordings.

Our result, assuming average velocity, shows identical features in comparison with both the Bouguer anomaly and the active seismic profile nearby, indicating that our method is reliable.

[...] The key targets of the G1 cyclins in this transition are the transcription factors SBF and MBF (not shown in the diagram), {{as well as the}} B-type cyclin inhibitor Sic1. [...] Cln-CDKs activate SBF by phosphorylating and promoting nuclear export of its inhibitor, Whi5, which associates with promoter-bound SBF. The precise mechanism of MBF activation is unknown.

2500|$|Although {{all three}} G1 cyclins are {{necessary}} for normal regulation of Start and the G1-S transition, Cln3 activity {{seems to be the}} deciding factor in <b>S-phase</b> initiation, with Cln1 and Cln2 serving to actuate the Cln3-based decision to transit Start. It was found early on that Cln3 activity induced expression of Cln1 and Cln2. Furthermore, Cln3 was a stronger activator Start transit than Cln1 and Cln2, even though Cln3-CDK had an inherently weaker kinase activity than the other Clns. This indicated that Cln3 was an upstream regulator of Cln1 and Cln2. Furthermore, it was found, as shown in Figure 1, that Cln1 and Cln2 could activate their own transcription via SBF, completing a positive feedback loop that could contribute to rapid activation and <b>S-phase</b> entry. Thus, Start transit seems to rely on reaching a sufficient level of Cln3-CDK activity to induce the Cln1,2 positive feedback loop, which rapidly increases SBF/MBF and Cln1,2 activity, allowing a switch-like G1-S transition. The role of positive feedback in this process has been challenged, [...] but recent experiments have confirmed its importance for rapid inactivation and nuclear export of Whi5, [...] which is the molecular basis of commitment to <b>S-phase.</b>|$|E

For both methods there are two problems. First, the results cannot be used for quantitation because standardization is impossible.

Differentiation is associated with selective up-regulation of the Cip/Kip cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p 57 and p 21; expression of p 27 remains constant. Previous studies showed that p 57 localizes to the nucleus in TGCs where {{it is essential for}} endoreplication. Here we show that p 27 also remains localized to the nucleus during TSC differentiation where it complements the role of p 57. Unexpectedly, p 21 localized to the cytoplasm where it was maintained throughout both the G- and <b>S-phases</b> of endocycles, and where it prevented DNA damage induced apoptosis. This unusual status for a Cip/Kip protein was dependent on site-specific phosphorylation of p 21 by the Akt 1 kinase that is also up-regulated in TGCs. Although cytoplasmic p 21 is widespread among cancer cells, among normal cells it has been observed only in monocytes. The fact that it also occurs in TGCs reveals that p 57 and p 21 serve nonredundant functions, and suggests that the role of p 21 in suppressing apoptosis is restricted to terminally differentiated cells...|$|R

40|$|Seismic {{anisotropy}} in the transpressional plate-boundary zone in New Zealand is investigated with shear-wave splitting to gain {{insights into}} lithospheric deformation and mantle flow. Constraints on plate-boundary deformation in the lithosphere of the oblique-collision and subduction regimes in South Island have been estimated {{from the local}} and regional shear-wave splitting parameters that are made at both inland and offshore seismographs. Mantle and lithospheric anisotropy of the southernmost Hikurangi subduction zone in the southern North Island is examined from SKS, ScS and teleseismic <b>S-phases.</b> The splitting of these phases measured on a recent transect crossing the Wellington region is analyzed to understand the lateral anisotropic structure of the fore-arc Hikurangi subduction zone. Local and regional splitting reveal both laterally and depth varying anisotropy in South Island. The scatter in splitting parameters at individual stations suggests the splitting of high-frequency <b>S-phases</b> is mainly controlled by heterogeneous anisotropic structure and S-wave propagation direction within those heterogeneities. When the average results are examined as a whole through 2 -D delay time tomographic inversion and spatial averaging, consistent patterns in delay times and fast azimuths exist. Spatially averaged fast azimuths indicate a localized high strain zone in the southern central region of the South Island. Based on fast azimuths observed above 100 km depth, we suggest that the plate-boundary sub-parallel anisotropy that is produced by pervasive shear is mainly distributed within a zone extending ~ 130 km SE of the Alpine fault in the southern South Island and is widely distributed (at least 200 km wide) in the northern South Island. Average station delay times (δt) of ~ 0. 1 - 0. 4 s compared to 1. 7 s SKS δt from previous studies in South Island further suggest a deep seated anisotropic zone or sensitivity of S-wave splitting to the layered and/or heterogeneous anisotropic structure of the plate-boundary zone in the inland South Island. The heterogeneous anisotropic structure further suggests that the lithosphere is not only characterized by the plate-boundary parallel shear related to Cenozoic deformation, but is also affected by anisotropic imprints from the other tectonic episodes and anisotropy that is governed by the contemporary stress. A shear-wave splitting anisotropy investigation in the offshore South Island regions is an extended study of the inland experiment and aims to provide a broad-scale understanding of the plate-boundary deformation. Individual splitting of local and regional <b>S-phases</b> yield a range of δt that varies between very small δt (~ 0. 02 s), which may represent a nearly isotropic medium, and large δt (~ 0. 6 s), which corresponds to lithospheric anisotropy. The average station δt of ~ 0. 25 s and variable delays of the individual splitting measurements imply that the observed splitting is most likely controlled by the geometry of the ray paths. Long ray paths that are detected at the stations further away from the plate-boundary appear to penetrate to deeper lithosphere and capture {{a significant portion of}} the upper-mantle anisotropy to produce fast azimuths parallel to the plate-boundary shear (NE-SW). Thus, the long and deep ray paths respond to the deeper structure, but may not be re-split by the upper-most crustal structures. However, the observed variable delays suggest that changes in ray propagation direction with respect to the orientation of symmetry axes of the anisotropic media may have an effect on the measured anisotropy. Offshore measurements that are close to the land are consistent with the inland measurements and appear to be controlled by the regional stress field. This implies that short and shallow ray paths are mostly sensitive to the crustal anisotropy. The uneven distribution of ray paths from the shallow and deep events, therefore, plays a dominant role in controlling the observed splitting depending on their depth sensitivity and/or extent of anisotropy. Consequently, when fast directions are spatially averaged along with the inland measurements consistent patterns appear to correlate with the possible depth contribution of anisotropy in the region. We are unable to provide accurate constraints on the offshore extent of plate-boundary parallel shear because of the shallow stress-controlled anisotropy that likely overlies the mantle-shear zone. However, the splitting parameters from long and deep ray paths suggest a deep-seated, plate-boundary sub-parallel shear in a broad zone at least in the northern and upper-central South Island. Mantle anisotropy detected from teleseismic earthquakes recorded across the southern North Island displays NE-SW fast axis alignment, consistent with the strike of the Hikurangi trench and the predominant upper-plate faulting trends, with a range of δt (~ 0. 5 - 3. 0 s) and small-scale variation in NE-SW fast azimuths. When combined with the previous measurements in the western side of the array, δt from long period (> 7 s) <b>S-phases</b> indicate an abrupt lateral variation across the fore-arc Hikurangi subduction zone. This lateral variation together with frequency dependence suggest that the shear wave splitting in the fore-arc of the Hikurangi subduction zone in the southern North Island is governed in part by the laterally varying crustal contribution of anisotropy or isotropic velocity variations within the shallow crust. Frequency dependent splitting also suggests that the anisotropic structure is governed by either multilayer or more complex anisotropy perhaps due to the combined effects of laterally varying multilayer structure. If the variations are due to lateral changes in crustal anisotropy, then mantle and crustal deformation are most likely coupled in the east of the Wairarapa fault where there is a possibility of strong crustal contribution...|$|R
40|$|Endomitosis is {{the process}} by which {{mammalian}} megakaryocytes become polyploid during terminal differentiation. As in other endoreplicating cells, cyclin-cdk complexes are distinctly regulated, probably to overcome the strict mechanisms that prevent re-replication in most somatic cells. We have asked whether key factors involved in the assembly and licensing of replication origins are equally regulated during endomitosis. Cdc 6, cdt 1 and geminin expression was analysed during differentiation of two human megakaryoblastic cell lines, HEL and K 562, which respectively do and do not establish endoreplication cycles. Geminin was downregulated, whereas cdt 1 levels were maintained upon differentiation of both cell lines, independently of whether cells entered extra <b>S-phases.</b> In contrast, cdc 6 was present and remained nuclear only in differentiated endoreplicating cells. Interestingly, cdc 6 protein expression was re-established in K 562 cells that underwent endomitosis after transient or stable cyclin E over-expression. The high levels of cyclin E reached in these cells appeared to influence the stabilization of cdc 6 protein rather than its RNA transcription rate. Finally, cdc 6 overexpression drove HEL cells into endoreplication cycles in the absence of differentiation stimuli. Our results show that both cdt 1 and cdc 6 are differentially regulated during megakaryocytic differentiation and suggest an active role of cdc 6 in endomitosis. 2 Bermejo et al...|$|R
