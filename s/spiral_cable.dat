40|$|A {{new concept}} of metal <b>spiral</b> coaxial <b>cable</b> is introduced. The {{solution}} to Maxwell’s equations for the fundamental propagating TEM eigenmode, using a generalization of the Schwarz-Christoffel conformal mapping of the spiral transverse section, is provided {{together with the}} analysis of the impedances and the Poynting vector of the line. The new cable may find application as a medium for telecommunication and networking or in the sector of the Microwave Photonics. A <b>spiral</b> plasmonic coaxial <b>cable</b> could be used to propagate subwavelength surface plasmon polaritons at optical frequencies. Furthermore, according to the present model, the myelinated nerves can be considered natural examples of <b>spiral</b> coaxial <b>cables.</b> This study suggests that a malformation of the Peters angle, which determines the power of the neural signal in the TEM mode, causes higher/lower power to be transmitted in the neural networks with respect to the natural level. The formulas of the myelin sheaths thickness, the diameter of the axon, and the spiral g factor of the lipid bilayers, which are mathematically related to the impedances of the spiral coaxial line, can make it easier to analyze the neural line impedance mismatches and the signal disconnections typical of the neurodegenerative diseases...|$|R

40|$|Structural cables {{are widely}} adopted {{around the world}} in {{offshore}} construction, sports stadia, large scale bridges, Ferris wheels and suspended canopy and fabric structures. However, the robustness of such structures to blast or impact is uncertain with a particular concern related to the loss of a primary structural cable when damaged by high velocity blast fragmentation. This paper presents the first ever numerical and experimental study on commonly used high-strength steel <b>spiral</b> strand <b>cables</b> subjected to high velocity fragment impact. <b>Spiral</b> strand <b>cables</b> were impacted by 20 mm fragment simulating projectiles travelling at velocities between 200 and 1400 m/s. Complex 3 D non-linear finite element models were developed and carefully compared with experimental tests. The penetration resistance of the cables and resultant damage were studied with respect to fragment impact velocity. It was found that for all the impact velocities, the fragment penetration depth was {{less than half of the}} cable diameter demonstrating a considerable amount of resilience. Considering the damage caused, the residual cable breaking strengths were estimated and found to be still higher than the minimum breaking load of an un-damaged cable. The numerical models were also able to reproduce the main features of the impact tests, including the extent of localised damage area, the fragment penetration depth and mode of individual wire failures, thus demonstrating their potential to be widely used in industry for structural resilience and robustness assessments by structural engineers...|$|R
40|$|In civil engineering, {{steel cables}} {{are widely used}} in the {{construction}} of bridges and sports stadia. However, their robustness and resilience against explosively formed fragment impact, whether accidental or malicious, remains largely unknown and very little research has been carried out on this subject to date. The concern is that small fragments projected from the explosion and travelling at high velocity may induce significant damage to the cables. This damage could rupture a cable releasing large amounts of kinetic energy into the surrounding structure and other damaged cables resulting in multiple cable loss and possible disproportionate collapse of the structure. To begin investigating this problem a good understanding of the localised damage sustained by the cables on impact is required. The work described within this thesis begins to address this problem by use of both physical tests and detailed finite element analysis. The tests involved firing fragment simulating projectiles at velocities ranging from 200 – 1400 m/s at un-tensioned <b>spiral</b> strand <b>cables.</b> Detailed finite element models have been developed for the <b>spiral</b> strand <b>cables,</b> with careful considerations given to the geometry of the cables, inter-wire contact mechanics, cable end boundary conditions and material modelling. The numerical results have been verified by comparison with the test results, with particular attention paid to the localised damage area, the fragment penetration depth, and the number of heavily damaged and totally broken wires. A global response study has also been undertaken on a case study structure to assess the effects of sudden cable loss. The work contained with this thesis forms part of larger research programme studying the robustness and resilience of cable supported structures subjected to highly transient loading conditions...|$|R
40|$|In the past, during {{construction}} or once {{the bridge was}} completed and in service stage, stay cable had known to vibrate due to rain-wind combination, which named rain-wind induced vibration (RWIV). Recently, it was also proved that stayed-cables could be excited even though in no rain condition that called dry galloping (DG). For RWIV, rain {{plays an important role}} in forming the lower and upper rivulets on cable surface that change the cable aerodynamic characteristics, and then excite galloping. This phenomenon can be mitigated by shape modification or increasing the Scruton number of cable. Together with that, dry galloping is classified as one of the wind-induced large amplitude vibration phenomena in dry weather (without rain), usually occurs at relatively high-reduced wind speed, it also showed some characteristics of limited amplitude vibration, however. Some studies showed the existence of dry galloping, in both wind tunnel test and the site observation. Nevertheless, its characteristics and mechanism are not fully understood as well as control methods for this phenomenon are under developing. Recently, some authors pointed out that current aerodynamic mitigation methods can adapted for RWIVs but not for the DG. The present research is therefore an effort to investigate insight of DG characteristics and its mechanism as well as develop an effective countermeasure for DG and RWIV. Experimental and analytical results proved that DG depends on wind attack angles and it is less sensitive to the cable damping change rather than frequency and it can occur in subcritical Re region. Moreover, there is a strong recovery of surface pressure in leeward side and in presence of single <b>spiral</b> protuberances, <b>cable</b> surface pressure redistributed. The mechanism of DG relate to the interruption of Karman vortex shedding and the excitation from low frequency flow/vortices at high wind speed. Further, its interaction with axial flow, wind attack angle are significant in forming dry galloping conditions. In addition, to assess the efficiency of current control methods for suppression the DG and RWIV, parallel protuberances and pattern-indented surface cables are investigated in low Scruton number range to reconfirm the efficiency. The results reaffirmed that DG only occurred in specific condition of wind-cable angle, wind speeds. Further, the cable with indented surface and parallel protuberances still exhibited large amplitude vibration in low Scruton number. Due to the fact like that, this study will continue developing an aerodynamically cable for suppressing wind and rain-wind induced vibration, named spiral protuberances. The recommendation for fabrication of <b>spiral</b> protuberance <b>cable</b> will be issued in considering the selective fillet sizes and fillet pitches and number of protuberances. Finally, the suppression mechanism of <b>spiral</b> protuberance <b>cable</b> and its stability characteristic will be discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|The load {{transfer}} mechanisms of cable bolts differ from normal rebar bolts. Cable bolts used in mines are basically steel strands with different constructions {{depending on the}} number of wires or elements and the way that these elements are laid. Tendon bolts (rebar and cable) are normally evaluated for strength and {{load transfer}} properties. The strength of tendon can be carried out by tensile failure tests, while the load transfer strength is evaluated by pull and shear strength tests. Short Encapsulation Pull Testing (SEPT) is used to study of the load transfer capacities of tendons, and can be undertaken both in the laboratory and in situ. A new apparatus known as Minova Axially Split Embedment Apparatus (MASEA) was used to study load-displacement characteristics of smooth versus <b>spiral</b> profile <b>cable</b> bolts. Minova Stratabinder grout was used for encapsulating 400 mm long 19 wire 22 mm diameter superstrand cable in the embedment units. The anchorage of the cable on two sides of the embedment apparatus were intentionally installed at different lengths, to allow the cable to be pulled out {{from one side of the}} anchorage. The <b>spiral</b> wire strand <b>cable</b> bolts achieved higher peak pull-out load at minimum displacement in comparison with smooth surface wire strand. The peak pull out force increased with the age of encapsulation grout. The MASEA was easier to assemble and test at a short period of time, thus allowing quick and repeated tests to be undertaken...|$|R

This new double shear apparatus is capable of determining the pure shear strength of pre-tensioned fully grouted cable bolt without friction between sheared concrete blocks. Five different types of cable bolt, with various pretension loads, were tested to investigate the influence of surface profile type and pretension load on the shear strength of cable bolt. Concrete blocks of 40 MPa strength and the Stratabinder HS grout were used for consistency across the entire tests. The {{results showed that the}} plain cable bolts had higher peak shear load compared with the indented and <b>spiral</b> strand <b>cable</b> bolts.

40|$|Heart wall myofibers wind as helices {{around the}} ventricles, {{strengthening}} {{them in a}} manner analogous to the reinforcement of concrete cylindrical columns by <b>spiral</b> steel <b>cables</b> [Richart FE, et al. (1929) Univ of Illinois, Eng Exp Stn Bull 190]. A multitude of such fibers, arranged smoothly and regularly, contract and relax as an integrated functional unit as the heart beats. To orchestrate this motion, fiber tangling must be avoided and pumping should be efficient. Current models of myofiber orientation across the heart wall suggest groupings into sheets or bands, but the precise geometry of bundles of myofibers is unknown. Here we show that this arrangement {{takes the form of}} a special minimal surface, the generalized helicoid [Blair DE, Vanstone JR (1978) Minimal Submanifolds and Geodesics 13 - 16], closing the gap between individual myofibers and their collective wall structure. The model holds across species, with a smooth variation in its three curvature parameters within the myocardial wall providing tight fits to diffusion magnetic resonance images from the rat, the dog, and the human. Mathematically it explains how myofibers are bundled in the heart wall while economizing fiber length and optimizing ventricular ejection volume as they contract. The generalized helicoid provides a unique foundation for analyzing the fibrous composite of the heart wall and should therefore find applications in heart tissue engineering and in the study of heart muscle disease...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a three {{degree of freedom}} formulation for the dynamic relaxation modelling of tubular bearing systems applied in arch supported membranes and closed hoop supported cable net bridging structures. For tubular arch structures the numerical modelling method has been validated against analytical and finite element models with span/rise ratios up to 20.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Extensive parametric studies have been carried out, using the orthotropic sheet theoretical model of Hobbs and Raoof, {{on a wide range}} of spiral strand constructions, with outside diameters, d, and lay angles, a, in the practical ranges, 16. 4 mm ≤ d ≤ 184 mm, and 11 ≤ α ≤ 24, respectively. The effects of an external hydrostatic pressure on certain structural characteristics of sealed spiral strands, used in deep water applications, have also been studied in some detail, for water depths ranging from 0 m to 2000 m. The results, based on such theoretical parametric studies, have, for example, been used to refute claims by Jolicoeur that, by a simple modification, a significant improvement to the original orthotropic sheet model of Hobbs and Raoof, had been found. In addition, using such studies, axial fatigue life design S-N curves have been developed, which cater for the effects of an externally applied hydrostatic pressure on sheathed spiral strands. Simple (hand-based) formulations have also been developed for estimating the maximum frictional axial and torsional hysteresis along with,the associated axial load range/mean axial load, and range of twist/ 2, respectively, at which they occur, relating to both, the in-air conditions and also when a sheathed spiral strand is subjected to an external hydrostatic pressure. The previously reported work of Raoof and his associates, in connection with the response of helical <b>cables</b> (<b>spiral</b> strands and/or wire ropes) to impact loading, has been extended to include the development of closed-form solutions for predicting the extensional-torsional wave speeds and displacements, in axially preloaded helical cables, experiencing a half-sine type of impact loading at one end, with the other end fixed. The influence of the lay angle on the response of a spiral strand to three different (i. e. unit-step, triangular and half-sine) forms of impact loading functions, has also been analysed, with much emphasis placed on the practical implications of the final results in connection with non-destructive methods of wire fracture detection under service conditions [...] . ...|$|R
