5|$|Research done by McCarthy and Taylor (1999), {{found that}} {{children}} with abusive childhood experiences {{were more likely to}} develop ambivalent attachments. The <b>study</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> children with ambivalent attachments were more likely to experience difficulties in maintaining intimate relationships as adults.|$|E
5|$|The Ricardo <b>study</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the {{lifecycle}} {{carbon emissions}} for mid-sized gasoline and diesel vehicles are almost identical, {{and that the}} greater fuel efficiency of the diesel engine is offset by higher production emissions.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the poor}} press {{surrounding}} the release, an independent study of select iOS users by Kantar Group {{found that in}} January 2015, 23% of music listeners played at least one song by U2, {{more than any other}} artist for that month. The <b>study</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> of those who listened to U2 music, 95% of them accessed at least one track from Songs of Innocence.|$|E
30|$|All {{the studies}} {{summarized}} in Table  1 <b>found</b> <b>that</b> having children {{increases the likelihood}} of self-employment among women. With one exception (Arai 2000), the <b>studies</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> having children increases the odds of self-employment among men.|$|R
30|$|Most of {{the studies}} on the culture in Indian {{organizations}} agree on the preference on employees for a personalized and dependent relationship with their leaders. These <b>studies</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> nurturing-task (benevolent-authoritative) leaders {{to be more effective}} in achieving the Organizational task objectives (Sinha, 1980; Hassan, 1985; Ansari, 1986; Pandey & Singh, 1987).|$|R
50|$|Two {{other studies}} {{examined}} personal reports from LGBT adults {{and their families}} living in Memphis, Tennessee, immediately after a successful 2006 ballot campaign banned same-sex marriage. Most respondents reported feeling alienated from their communities. The <b>studies</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> families experienced a kind of secondary minority stress, says Jennifer Arm, a counseling {{graduate student at the}} University of Memphis.|$|R
5|$|In 2016, a study {{published}} in the Lancet reported that state laws only requiring background checks or permits for gun sales at gun shows were associated with higher rates of gun-related deaths. The same <b>study</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> state laws that required background checks for all gun sales were strongly associated with lower rates of gun-related deaths.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} the National Audubon Society has found that populations of some the most common birds in North America have {{plummeted}} since 1967, with some species showing a decline of 80 percent. The <b>study</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> California species were particularly affected, with population declines of 75 to 96 percent for several species, including the northern pintail, horned lark and loggerhead shrike. The decline {{may be due to}} loss of habitat to urban sprawl, especially grasslands, forests and wetlands, energy development and industrialized agriculture. Climate change could compound losses in the future.|$|E
5|$|The ITS-Davis <b>study</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> a {{small but}} {{influential}} minority of dealers have introduced new approaches to better {{meet the needs of}} plug-in customers. Examples include marketing carpool lane stickers, enrolling buyers in charging networks, and preparing incentive paperwork for customers. Some dealers assign seasoned sales people as plug-in experts, many of whom drive plug-ins themselves to learn and be familiar with the technology and relate the car’s benefits to potential buyers. The study concluded also that carmakers could do much more to support dealers selling PEVs.|$|E
50|$|Rimé <b>found</b> <b>that</b> 80-95% of {{emotional}} episodes are shared. The affected individuals {{talk about the}} emotional experience recurrently to people around them throughout the following hours, days, or weeks. These results indicate that this response is irrespective {{of emotional}} valence, gender, education, and culture. His <b>studies</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> social sharing of emotion increases as {{the intensity of the}} emotion increases.|$|R
50|$|People have {{different}} views about cartoons {{and the violence}} within them. Some researchers believe that high level of violence in cartoons can make children more aggressive. Their <b>studies</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> young children tend to mimic the negative behavior they see on television. Output aimed at {{children as young as}} seven, which include a number of cartoons, had the highest levels of violence.|$|R

5|$|A 2017 {{histological}} {{study of}} growth lines {{found that the}} Portuguese Baryonyx specimen had died between the age of 23 and 25 years old, and was close to its maximum size and skeletal maturity. This contradicted a younger age indicated by the neurocentral sutures not being fused, {{and the presence of}} both mature and sub-adult traits may be due to paedomorphosis (where juvenile traits are retained into adulthood). Paedomorphic traits may be related to swimming locomotion, as they have been suggested in other extinct animals thought to have been aquatic (such as plesiosaurs and temnospondyls). The <b>study</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the animal had reached sexual maturity at the age of 13 to 15 years, due to a decrease in growth rate at this point.|$|E
5|$|From these models, {{researchers}} also predict that bee populations will start declining most {{significantly in the}} southern latitudes with lagging range expansion in the north. Kerr and his colleagues found that as the climate has shifted, bumblebees {{have been forced to}} operate outside of their thermal ranges, causing range losses along the species’ southern limits. However, the <b>study</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> while other flora and fauna have expanded their northerly ranges to account for the climate shifts, bumblebees have not expanded farther north. The most important findings in this study came from statistical models built to study whether or not these range shifts were due to confounding factors such as pesticide use or changes in land cover. The researchers found that climate change had the most meaningful impact on range shifts and bee distributions. To support these findings, the scientists note that failure for the bumblebee to respond to thermal changes and expand their northern range underscores the idea that bumblebees are susceptible to climate change.|$|E
5|$|World {{leaders and}} their diplomats have taken note of Twitter's rapid {{expansion}} and have been increasingly utilizing Twitter diplomacy, the use of Twitter to engage with foreign publics and their own citizens. US Ambassador to Russia, Michael A. McFaul has been attributed as a pioneer of international Twitter diplomacy. He used Twitter after becoming ambassador in 2011, posting in English and Russian. On October 24, 2014, Queen Elizabeth II sent her first tweet to mark {{the opening of the}} London Science Museum's Information Age exhibition. A 2013 study by website Twiplomacy found that 153 of the 193 countries represented at the United Nations had established government Twitter accounts. The same <b>study</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> those accounts amounted to 505 Twitter handles used by world {{leaders and their}} foreign ministers, with their tweets able to reach a combined audience of over 106 million followers.|$|E

50|$|Research {{conducted}} by several development agencies (World Bank, CIDA, USAID, IRDP) {{suggests that there}} are many benefits to be gained through the use of PD. These studies suggest that while PD projects may have high start up costs, they will be less expensive and more sustainable in the long run. These <b>studies</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> PD projects are better at addressing local needs and are generally more relevant to local populations than traditional development projects.|$|R
5000|$|The {{number of}} Americans holding antisemitic views {{declined}} markedly {{six years later}} when another ADL study classified only 12 percent of the population—between 20 and 25 million adults—as [...] "most anti-Semitic." [...] Confirming the findings of previous surveys, both <b>studies</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> African Americans {{were significantly more likely}} than whites to hold antisemitic views, with 34 percent of blacks classified as [...] "most anti-Semitic," [...] compared to 9 percent of whites in 1998.|$|R
5|$|A 2010 {{study of}} the stream found that the Fonteyn Kill's {{specific}} conductance, {{a measure of the}} amount of dissolved road salt in the stream's water, was nearly 1.0 mS/cm, higher than any value recorded in the Casperkill. Sites upstream of Vassar Lake were recorded in a separate study as having specific conductances twice as high as locations downstream of the lake, suggesting a regulating effect caused by water mixing and retention in Vassar Lake. The total inorganic nitrogen in the kill, which is usually correlated with surrounding green cover, was about , average for measurements taken in the Fonteyn Kill and Casperkill in that study. The <b>study</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the Fonteyn Kill's score on the Hilsenhoff family biotic index (HBI), a scale measuring pollution based on the tolerance of endemic benthic macroinvertebrates, was approximately six, indicating fairly poor water quality, with scores {{for the rest of the}} Casperkill–Fonteyn Kill watershed were as high as seven (poor water quality) to as low as four (very good water quality).|$|E
5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} are {{the most}} important adverse effect of bupropion. A high incidence of seizures was responsible for the temporary withdrawal of the drug from the market between 1986 and 1989. The risk of seizure is strongly dose-dependent, but also dependent on the preparation. The sustained-release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.1% at daily dosages of less than 300mg of bupropion and 0.4% at 300–400mg. The immediate release preparation is associated with a seizure incidence of 0.4% for dosages below 450mg; the incidence climbs to 5% for dosages between 450–600mg per day. For comparison, the incidence of unprovoked seizure in the general population is 0.07 to 0.09%, and the risk of seizure for a variety of other antidepressants is generally between 0.1 and 1.5% at recommended dosage levels. Clinical depression itself has been reported to increase the occurrence of seizures, and a study examining FDA clinical trial data has suggested that in most cases, low to moderate doses of antidepressants may not actually increase seizure risk at all. However, this <b>study</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> bupropion and clomipramine were unique among antidepressants in that they were associated with increased incidence of seizures.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} sexual {{cannibalism}} has been debated; experiments show that females on low quality diets {{have a higher}} chance to engage in sexual cannibalism compared to females on high quality diets. Some consider that submissive males gain a selective advantage by producing offspring. This theory {{is supported by a}} quantifiable increase in the duration of copulation among males which are cannibalized, in some cases doubling both the duration and the chance of fertilization. This is contrasted by a study where males were seen to approach hungry females with more caution, and were shown to remain mounted on hungry females for a longer time, indicating that males that actively avoid cannibalism may mate with multiple females. The same <b>study</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> hungry females generally attracted fewer males than those that were well fed. The act of dismounting after copulation is dangerous for males, for at this time, females most frequently cannibalize their mates. An increase in mounting duration appears to indicate that males wait for an opportune time to dismount a hungry female, who would be likely to cannibalize her mate.|$|E

50|$|A 2014 {{study by}} the Center for Immigration <b>Studies</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> both {{documented}} immigrants and their minor children made up {{a significant portion of}} Medicaid growth from 2011 to 2013. Prior to Obama's speech, Democrats had twice rejected amendments to the bill requiring documentation of legal status in the United States in order to receive benefits under the proposed plan, contending that a more complex application process would delay or prevent citizens from receiving health care.|$|R
5|$|He {{concluded}} that the caudofemoralis muscles which link the tail bones and the upper leg bones could have assisted Tyrannosaurus in leg retraction and enhanced its running ability, agility and balance. The caudofemoralis muscle {{would have been a}} key muscle in femoral retraction; pulling back the leg at the femur. The <b>study</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> theropod skeletons such as those of Tyrannosaurus had adaptations (such as elevated transverse processes in the tail vertebrae) to enable the growth of larger tail muscles and that Tyrannosaurus's tail muscle mass may have been underestimated by over 25 percent and perhaps as much as 45 percent. The caudofemoralis muscle was found to comprise 58 percent of the muscle mass in the tail of Tyrannosaurus. Tyrannosaurus also had the largest absolute and relative caudofemoralis muscle mass out of the three extinct organisms in the study. This is because Tyrannosaurus also had additional adaptations to enable large tail muscles; the elongation of its tail's hemal arches. According to Persons, the increase in tail muscle mass would have moved the center of mass closer to the hindquarters and hips which would have lessened the strain on the leg muscles to support its weight; improving its overall balance and agility. This would also have made the animal less front-heavy, thus reducing rotational inertia. Persons also notes that the tail is also rich in tendons and septa which could have been stores of elastic energy, and thereby improved locomotive efficiency. Persons adds that this means non-avian theropods actually had broader tails than previously depicted, as broad or broader laterally than dorsoventrally near the base.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} Barrett and Marshall {{has shown that}} random acts of {{intercourse}} achieve a 24% pregnancy rate per cycle. That <b>study</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> timed intercourse based on information from a BBT-only method of FA increased pregnancy rates to 31%–68%.|$|E

5000|$|A {{study of}} Iowa's farmers' markets showed that 140 jobs {{were created in}} a single year that could be {{attributed}} to farmers' market activity. [...] Other <b>studies</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> farmers' market activity directly and indirectly supports the growth of local jobs. [...] One study showed that 5.4 jobs were created per farmers' market. This figure was used to suggest that public funding of 100 to 500 'otherwise-unsuccessful' farmers' markets per year could generate 13,500 jobs in five years.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{individuals}} {{may be more}} prone to experiencing awe. Using self- and peer-reports, researchers <b>found</b> <b>that</b> regularly experiencing awe was associated with openness to experience (self and peer-ratings) and extroversion (self-ratings). Later <b>studies</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> people who regularly experience awe ("awe-prone") have lower need for cognitive closure {{and are more likely}} to describe themselves in oceanic (e.g. [...] "I am an inhabitant of the planet Earth"), individuated, and universal terms, as opposed to more specific terms (e.g. [...] "I have blonde hair").|$|R
50|$|Moreover, {{adoption}} {{studies indicate}} that, by adulthood, adoptive siblings {{are no more}} similar in IQ than strangers (IQ correlation near zero), while full siblings show an IQ correlation of 0.6. Twin studies reinforce this pattern: monozygotic (identical) twins raised separately are highly similar in IQ (0.74), more so than dizygotic (fraternal) twins raised together (0.6) and much more than adoptive siblings (~0.0). Recent adoption <b>studies</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> supportive parents can {{have a positive effect}} on the development of their children.|$|R

25|$|Studies {{conducted}} on red wolves support previous researchers' contention that helpers obtain both immediate and long-term gains from cooperative breeding. Researchers evaluated {{the consequences of}} red wolves' decisions to stay with their packs for {{extended periods of time}} after birth. While delayed dispersal helped other wolves' offspring, <b>studies</b> <b>also</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> it extended male helper wolves' life spans.
