5000|$|The {{diameter}} of the Pfund flat is generally larger than the focusing paraboloid, and is a design trade between fully illuminated field of view coverage and flat cost and weight.

A first analysis of stellar variability led to the publication of 345 newly discovered variable stars. Now, a deeper analysis of this data set was used to optimize the variability search procedure. Several methods and parameters have been tested {{in order to improve}} the selection process compared to the widely used J index for variability ranking. This paper describes an empirical approach to treat systematic trends in photometric data based upon the analysis of variance statistics that can significantly decrease the rate of false detections. Finally, the process of reanalysis and method improvement has virtually doubled the number of variable stars compared to the first analysis by Kabath et al.

The resulting archive of stellar photometric light curves is used to search for deep transit events announced during CoRoT's alarm mode to aid in fast photometric confirmation of these events. The “initial run” field of CoRoT (IRa 01) was observed with BEST in 2006 November and December for 12 nights. The first “long run” field (LRc 01) was observed from 2005 June to September for 35 nights. After standard CCD data reduction, aperture photometry has been performed using the ISIS image subtraction method. About 30, 000 light curves were obtained in each field. Transits of the first detected planets by the CoRoT mission, CoRoT- 1 b and CoRoT- 2 b, were found in archived data of the BEST survey and their light curves are presented here.

40|$|The {{search for}} extrasolar planets is a {{relatively}} new field in astronomical and astrophysical sciences that was boosted by the first discovery of the exoplanet 51 Peg b in 1995 by radial velocity measurements. The short orbital period of 4. 2 days determined for this giant exoplanet encouraged the accelerated development of another search method due to the high probability that such a Hot Jupiter planet would cross its host star in the line of sight yielding a photometrically detectable signal during this crossing. This transit method (also known as the occultation or eclipse method) measures such a darkening signal as an evidence for an orbiting planet allowing the determination of the radius of the planet. Combined with the information obtained with radial velocity measurements the mass and the density of the planet can be calculated. This unique opportunity to study detailed physical properties of exoplanets is advantageous compared to planets proven only by other search methods. In this thesis the establishing of the new ground-based transit survey Berlin Exoplanet <b>Search</b> <b>Telescope</b> (BEST) is described.
