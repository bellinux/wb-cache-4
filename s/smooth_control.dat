40|$|An {{intelligent}} PV power <b>smoothing</b> <b>control</b> using probabilistic fuzzy {{neural network}} with asymmetric membership function (PFNN-AMF) is proposed in this study. First, a photovoltaic (PV) power plant with a battery energy storage system (BESS) is introduced. The BESS consisted of a bidirectional DC/AC 3 -phase inverter and LiFePO 4 batteries. Then, the difference of the actual PV power and smoothed power is supplied by the BESS. Moreover, the network structure of the PFNN-AMF and its online learning algorithms are described in detail. Furthermore, the three-phase output currents of the PV power plant are converted to the dq-axis current components. The resulted q-axis current is the input of the PFNN-AMF power <b>smoothing</b> <b>control,</b> and the output is a smoothing PV power curve to achieve the effect of PV power smoothing. Comparing to the other smoothing methods, a minimum energy capacity of the BESS with a small fluctuation of the grid power {{can be achieved by}} the PV power <b>smoothing</b> <b>control</b> using PFNN-AMF. In addition, a personal computer- (PC-) based PV power plant emulator and BESS are built for the experimentation. From the experimental results of various irradiance variation conditions, the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent PV power <b>smoothing</b> <b>control</b> can be verified...|$|R

50|$|Variable {{structure}} control (VSC) {{is a form}} of discontinuous nonlinear control. The method {{alters the}} dynamics of a nonlinear system by application of a high-frequency switching control. The state-feedback control law is not a continuous function of time; it switches from one smooth condition to another. So the structure of the control law varies based on the position of the state trajectory; the method switches from one <b>smooth</b> <b>control</b> law to another and possibly very fast speeds (e.g., for a countably infinite number of times in a finite time interval). VSC and associated sliding mode behaviour was first investigated in early 1950s in the Soviet Union by Emelyanov and several coresearchers.|$|E

50|$|By exposing part of {{the winding}} coils and making the {{secondary}} connection through a sliding brush, a continuously variable turns ratio can be obtained, allowing for very <b>smooth</b> <b>control</b> of output voltage. The output voltage {{is not limited to}} the discrete voltages represented by actual number of turns. The voltage can be smoothly varied between turns as the brush has a relatively high resistance (compared with a metal contact) and the actual output voltage is a function of the relative area of brush in contact with adjacent windings. The relatively high resistance of the brush also prevents it from acting as a short circuited turn when it contacts two adjacent turns. Typically the primary connection connects to only a {{part of the}} winding allowing the output voltage to be varied smoothly from zero to above the input voltage and thus allowing the device to be used for testing electrical equipment at the limits of its specified voltage range.|$|E
50|$|Made before {{sophisticated}} CGI {{became the}} norm in filmmaking, the film's opening sequence featured a long pull-out reveal of the immense titular Typhoon-class sub. It included a nearly full-scale, above-the-water-line mockup of the sub, constructed from two barges welded together. Each country's submarine had its own background color: Soviet submarines, such as Red October and Konovalov, had interiors in black with silver trim. American ships, such as Dallas and Enterprise, had grey interiors. However, during one scene when Dallas goes to a higher alert status it was flooded with red light. Early filming was aboard USS Reuben James {{in the area of}} the Juan de Fuca Strait and Puget Sound in March 1989. The ship operated out of U.S. Coast Guard Station Port Angeles. The SH-60B detachment from the Battlecats of HSL-43 operated out of NAS Whidbey Island, after being displaced by the filmcrew. Most underwater scenes were filmed using smoke with a model sub connected to 12 cables, giving precise, <b>smooth</b> <b>control</b> for turns. Computer effects, in their infancy, created bubbles and other effects such as particulates in the water.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The battery {{energy storage}} station (BESS) {{is the current}} and typical means of {{smoothing}} wind- or solar-power generation fluctuations. Such BESS-based hybrid power systems require a suitable control strategy that can effectively regulate power output levels and {{battery state of charge}} (SOC).

Lip and face muscles are controlled by the information embedded in the utterance and its related expressiveness.

30|$|The {{effects of}} topographies on tested taxa were {{summarised}} in Additional file 2 : Table S 2 and Additional file 3 : Table S 3 according to taxa, topography scale and topographic geometry. The defined range of macro, micro and nano topography is 1 - 10  mm, 1 to ≤ 1000  μm and 1 -[*]≤[*] 1000  nm respectively. Additionally, studies that investigated the antifouling properties of hierarchical structures are also included. The discussions review topographic effects according to macro algae, micro algae and marine invertebrates. The inhibition or increased fouling by taxa {{is determined by}} comparing the settlement densities of textured surfaces with <b>smooth</b> <b>controls</b> where possible. Results of topographies that did not inhibit or encourage fouling are identified {{by the lack of}} statistical difference in settlement densities between tested topographies and <b>smooth</b> <b>controls.</b> Inconsistent settlement behaviour within a study or between studies is also noted.|$|R
