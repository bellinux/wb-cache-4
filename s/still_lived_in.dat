5|$|The Jews of the Papal States, {{numbering}} 15,000 {{or so in}} 1858, were {{grateful to}} Pope Pius IX because he had ended the long-standing legal obligation for them to attend sermons in church four times a year, based on that week's Torah portion and aimed at their conversion to Christianity. He had also torn down {{the gates of the}} Roman Ghetto despite the objections of many Christians. However, Jews remained under many restrictions and the vast majority <b>still</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the ghetto.|$|E
5|$|Helm {{made his}} only run for federal office in 1838 and was {{defeated}} by Willis Green for {{a seat in the}} United States House of Representatives. He returned to the Kentucky House in 1839 and was re-elected in 1842 and 1843, serving as Speaker of the House both years. In 1843, the Kentucky General Assembly proposed to create a new county from part of Hardin County and name it Helm County in honor of John L. Helm. Because of the few dissenting votes on this question, Helm declined the honor and proposed instead that the county be called LaRue County after his mother's family, many of whom <b>still</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the proposed county. Helm's suggestion was unanimously adopted.|$|E
5|$|In this period, {{while the}} Great Migration of African Americans {{out of the}} South to the North was beginning, blacks in the two regions dealt with {{different}} conditions. The {{vast majority of the}} millions of African Americans <b>still</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the South, many in rural areas where they were the majority population. But they were effectively disfranchised by new electoral rules and state constitutions, utterly closed out of the political process. This situation would continue, despite some temporarily effective court challenges, through the 1960s. Washington believed he had to help this population within the constraints of their environment. At the same time, he secretly funded legal challenges against the voter registration and electoral restrictions. Trotter and other radicals tended to come from the North, where African Americans exercised more rights in daily life, including the suffrage, were more urbanized, and had achieved more in work and education, but were still subject to discrimination.|$|E

5|$|The regular Football League {{returned}} {{in time for}} the 1946–47 season, during which Matthews played 23 league games and was a major contributor to 30 of the club's 41 league goals. Stoke matched their record finish of fourth in the league, finishing just two points shy of champions Liverpool after losing to Sheffield United {{on the final day of}} the season. However, in February Matthews was returning from a knee injury when manager McGrory told him he was not in the first XI for the game against Arsenal; the press reported this as a bust-up. Relations between McGrory, the Stoke City board, and Matthews had indeed always been sour – though once again a story that the players sided against Matthews were untrue. Recalled against Brentford, only after the game did he find out that this was only because he was a last-minute replacement for an injured Bert Mitchell. Matthews put in a second transfer request, which the Stoke board eventually accepted. He selected Blackpool as his next club as he <b>still</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the area following his service in the RAF; the Stoke board sanctioned the move on the condition that the deal was to remain a secret until the end of the season, so as to not disrupt the club's title bid. The secret was revealed in a matter of hours, as an unknown person informed the press.|$|E

By this time, {{tens of thousands}} of African Americans had left the South for northern and midwestern cities in the Great Migration, but the majority <b>still</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the South. There they were politically disenfranchised and subject to Jim Crow laws and white supremacy.

25|$|There {{was also}} an Italian {{community}} {{in the area of}} the Galata Tower. Having surrendered before the fall of the city Mehmet allowed them to preserve an element of self-government. For generations after they supplied interpreters and diplomats for the Ottoman Court. After the conquest of Egypt in 1517, and the Sultan's acceptance of the position of Caliph, Constantinople acquired an additional importance in Muslim eyes. Mosques built by Suleyman the Magnificent and his successors gave the city the unique appearance it still preserves today. The individual communities, though, <b>still</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> self-contained areas, and had little in the way of social interaction, a source of future trouble.|$|E
