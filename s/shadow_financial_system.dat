40|$|The {{objective}} of the present research is to propose a debate about the violations perpetrated over credit money due to the rupture of Bretton Woods’s agreements {{and the emergence of}} a <b>shadow</b> <b>financial</b> <b>system.</b> These changes distorted credit money as one of the fundamental pillars for stability and development of international economic system, causing the current crisis. Our research is mainly based on the post-keynesian theoretical approach about credit money developed by Parguez (2010), Gnos and Rochon (2004), Secareccia and Parguez (2000), etc. The other theoretical grounds are the analysis made by Tobias and Hyun Song over the <b>shadow</b> <b>financial</b> <b>system</b> and the valuable contributions of Parguez (2010), Guttman (2010), Girón and Chapoy (2009) about financial crisis in Europe, United States and Latin America. To accomplish our purpose we have analyzed the following topics: 1) 	Credit money and the metamorphosis of the parallel financial system 2) 	The insertion of financial circuits to the speculative financial circuit 3) 	Credit money and its role in the recovery In order to explain the current structural crisis this research does not neglect its origins and development.

40|$|My aim in {{this paper}} is to show the way in which {{microfinance}} acquires the face of women. While microfinance institutions (MFIs) act under the flag of “serving the common good,” there are still the interests of institutional investors behind them, who are looking to profit through international financial circuits. On one hand, microfinance is part of financial innovation in the global financial circuits. On the other hand, women’s bancarization inserts them into the labor market, hence into the financial circuits. MFIs become part of the <b>shadow</b> <b>financial</b> <b>system.</b> When debating microcredit’s profitability from a gender perspective, I note both the financial effectiveness of microcredits and the role of women as highly profitable economic agents. Is there a relation between financialization and microcredit? Is microcredit an achievement that will improve the economic, political, and social environment for women? Why is it that women’s bancarization has been a priority of international financial organizations? Microcredit with a woman’s face confirms the suggested hypotheses. Their empowerment through microcredit is a new way for financial investors to obtain higher profits through MFIs. The highest interest rates that MFIs charges are an expression of financialization by institutional investors...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the problems exposed {{by the global}} financial crisis {{in the areas of}} financial regulation and supervision and possible solutions. It describes and evaluates current proposals regarding the role of the central bank as a systemic regulator, the pros and the cons of locating financial supervision in the central bank, and the conflicts and synergies that such an arrangement entails. Once a crisis erupts, central bank liquidity injections constitute a first line of defense. But in the longer term these injections create a trade-off between price and financial stability, and may compromise central bank independence. Problems exposed by the crisis include the growth of a poorly regulated <b>shadow</b> <b>financial</b> <b>system,</b> shortermism in executive compensation packages and consequent adverse incentive effects, the too-big-to-fail problem, procyclicality in the behavior of financial institutions, conflicts of interest in the rating agencies industry and the trade-off between the scope of intermediation through securitization and transparency in the valuation of assets. The paper also discusses international dimensions including international cooperation in regulatory reform and the scope for limiting exchange rate variability.
