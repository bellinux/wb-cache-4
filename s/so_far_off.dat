As teammate to Érik Comas, at the 1994 European Grand Prix at Jerez, there were fears that both he and fellow newcomer Domenico Schiattarella would be <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> the pace that they would not beat Bertrand Gachot's horrible Pacific to the last grid spot.|$|E
25|$|Both Fort Augustus and Fort Edmonton {{moved to}} the mouth of White Earth Creek, 100km {{northeast}} of modern Edmonton at the northernmost point of the North Saskatchewan near present-day Smoky Lake, Alberta. This location was only active for two years for two main reasons: the Cree had been encouraged to visit other posts to avoid violent confrontations with the Blackfoot, yet the Blackfoot refused to travel <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> of their normal circles and consequently took their trade south to Americans.|$|E
25|$|Many {{collectors}} long {{thought the}} blue plane portion was printed first, {{thus it was}} actually the red frames that were inverted. However, research by noted philatelic authors Henry Goodkind and George Amick shows this to be incorrect; in fact, the frames were printed first {{and it is the}} planes that are upside down. In examples where the plane is <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> center that it overlaps the frames, {{it can be seen that}} the blue ink used to print the plane lies atop the red ink used to print the frames. The Smithsonian's National Postal Museum offers two explanations for how this might have occurred: either a sheet of printed frames was placed in the press upside down for the printing of the plane; or the printing plate used to print the planes was mounted inverted within the printing press.|$|E

500|$|These critiques {{were not}} taken seriously by AI researchers, often because they seemed <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> the point. Problems like intractability and commonsense {{knowledge}} seemed much more immediate and serious. It was unclear what difference [...] "know how" [...] or [...] "intentionality" [...] made to an actual computer program. Minsky said of Dreyfus and Searle [...] "they misunderstand, {{and should be}} ignored." [...] Dreyfus, who taught at MIT, was given a cold shoulder: he later said that AI researchers [...] "dared not be seen having lunch with me." [...] Joseph Weizenbaum, the author of ELIZA, felt his colleagues' treatment of Dreyfus was unprofessional and childish. Although he was {{an outspoken critic of}} Dreyfus' positions, he [...] "deliberately made it plain that theirs was not the way to treat a human being." ...|$|E

2500|$|Brookes' {{subsequent}} {{report was}} extremely vague; {{it did not}} even give a position for the wreck. James Henderson characterises this as deliberate obfuscation, an attempt to avoid the blame for being <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> course. Consequently, the Tryal Rocks were originally thought to be well {{to the west of}} their actual location. Concerned for the threat to their own ships, the Dutch placed the reef on their charts, but [...] "exactly south of the western extremity of Java according to the statements made by the English sailors". This represents an error of around ten degrees of longitude.|$|E

After the release, Game announced his plan on retiring from music, just {{to spend more}} time with his family and focusing on what's more important to him during the time. However, he later stated Interscope Records didn't want him to retire, and the label wanted him to come back and release another album, which was for February 2009. Game commented these statements about given was <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> his radar and that it was ridiculous.

2500|$|In late 1986, Faith No More {{was signed}} to Los Angeles label Slash Records by Anna Statman. The label had {{recently}} been sold to the Warner Music Group subsidiary London Records, ensuring a widespread release for the band's following albums. Introduce Yourself was released in 1987, and a revamped version of their debut album's title track [...] "We Care a Lot" [...] saw minor success on MTV. Mosley's behaviour had started to become increasingly erratic, particularly during a troubled tour of Europe in 1988. Incidents include him allegedly punching Billy Gould on stage, the release party for the album Introduce Yourself — during which he fell asleep on stage — and one of Mosley's roadies getting into a fist fight with guitarist Jim Martin during the European tour. Mosley was eventually fired after the band returned home from Europe. Billy Gould reflected [...] "There was a certain point when I went to rehearsal, and Chuck wanted to do all acoustic guitar songs. It was just <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>off</b> the mark. The upshot was that I got up, walked out and quit the band. I Just said: ‘I’m done – I can’t take this any longer. It’s just so ridiculous’. The same day, I talked to Bordin, and he said: ‘Well, I still {{want to play with}} you’. Bottum did the same thing. It was another one of these ‘firing somebody without firing them’ scenarios." ...|$|E

60|$|Lady Peveril {{could not}} help {{entertaining}} a vague idea, that Bridgenorth was not so distant. The extreme order in which everything was maintained at Moultrassie Hall, seemed--no disparagement {{to the care of}} Dame Dickens the housekeeper, and the other persons engaged--to argue, that the master's eye was not <b>so</b> very <b>far</b> <b>off,</b> but that its occasional inspection might be apprehended. It is true, that neither the domestics nor the attorney answered any questions respecting the residence of Master Bridgenorth; but there was an air of mystery about them when interrogated, that seemed to argue more than met the ear.|$|R
6000|$|The gorge in the mountains, {{which the}} {{travellers}} soon afterwards entered, fully justified the guide's expression [...] "dangerous." [...] It was a wild, rugged glen, {{high up on}} one side of which the narrow pathway wound--in some places rounding a cliff or projecting boulder, which rendered the passage of the baggage-mules extremely difficult. Indeed, one of the mules did slightly graze a rock with its burden; and, although naturally sure-footed, was <b>so</b> <b>far</b> thrown <b>off</b> its balance as to be within a hair's-breadth of tumbling over the edge and being dashed to pieces on the rocks below, where a turbulent river rushed tumultuously {{at the bottom of the}} glen.|$|R

5|$|There {{has been}} {{occasional}} controversy surrounding triple-doubles made when a player achieves the feat with a late rebound. Players with nine rebounds {{in a game}} have sometimes been accused of deliberately missing a shot {{late in the game}} in order to recover the rebound; a few have even gone <b>so</b> <b>far</b> as shooting <b>off</b> their opponent's basket trying to score a triple-double. To deter this, NBA rules allow rebounds to be nullified if the shot is determined not to be a legitimate scoring attempt.|$|R
5000|$|In 1901, {{also for}} D'Oyly Carte, she created {{the role of}} Molly O'Grady in The Emerald Isle. Her reviews were enthusiastic: [...] "Miss Louie Pounds <b>so</b> <b>far</b> carries <b>off</b> the honours … that she is allotted the sweetest airs, and does justice to them with her dulcet contralto voice.… Pretty of face and comely of figure, she makes the most winsome of colleens, and 'tis a lucky … Mr. Henry Lytton to be the {{accepted}} sweetheart of such a purty lassie." [...] Pounds next played Christina in another Savoy piece, Ib and Little Christina, after which, she played the title role in the first revival of Iolanthe (1901 - 1902). Next at the Savoy were two original works by Hood and Edward German. Pounds played [...] "Jill-all-alone" [...] in Merrie England (1902), and Joy Jellicoe in A Princess of Kensington (1903). Following the latter's London run and subsequent provincial tour, Pounds left the D'Oyly Carte company, which vacated the Savoy Theatre at that time.|$|R

Eventually after nearly six hours of fighting, the last of the Spanish galleys had been repelled with some in a sinking state. Doria's galleys had all suffered much damage and losses in galley slaves, soldiers and sailors had been heavy.
