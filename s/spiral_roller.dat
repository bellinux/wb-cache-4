50|$|In the mid 1990s, Intamin built a <b>spiral</b> <b>roller</b> coaster in South Korea. Not much {{is known}} about the design, but only one of these {{coasters}} were built. The only Spiral Coaster ever built is located in Kuwait, but it has been closed for several years and is considered unlikely to operate again.|$|E
40|$|Chain-die Forming {{is a novel}} {{sheet metal}} forming {{technology}} developed recently. It effectively minimizes the redundant deformation during forming {{in order to reduce}} residual stresses to very small values even to zero in product, which is impossible to be achieved through conventional roll forming. Better quality of products therefore can be expected with the development of this new technology. This article is to use FEM to analyze the stresses developed in the <b>spiral</b> <b>roller</b> {{which is one of the}} key elements in a Chain-die former. In order to optimize the design of Chain-die former, the results of equivalent stress have been collected and analyzed to understand the capability of the <b>spiral</b> <b>roller.</b> Maximum working load as an important index therefore can be determined. The comparison between <b>spiral</b> <b>roller</b> and simple hollow roller is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the three main soil tillage operations: conventional tillage, minimum tillage and direct seeding in wheat production. For conventional tillage operations, main tillage tool was moldboard plough. For minimum tillage, two tillage alternatives were applied; in first alternative, the plough were replaced with heavy-duty disk harrow. In second alternative, soil was prepared for seeding with only one pass of soil tillage combination of chisel, rotary tiller and <b>spiral</b> <b>roller.</b> Direct seeding was applied with no-tillage after herbicide use. For each applications, travel speed, slip and fuel consumption were measured. After the operations, soil properties such as soil moisture, bulk density and porosity were measured from soil samples and cone index were measured from the penetrometer resistance of the soils. Finally, fuel consumption and the tillage efficiency were calculated for each application from the measured data and from that, the economic analysis was made. According to the results, all tillage parameters were found statistically significant. The direct seeding gives the best results for fuel consumption and the tillage efficiency 8. 9 L ha - 1 and 1. 25 ha h - 1, respectively. On the contrary, conventional tillage has the highest fuel consumptions and the lowest tillage efficiency 58. 4 L ha - 1 and 0. 27 ha h - 1, respectively. Although the conventional tillage method gives the good preparation of the seed-bed with weed free condition and high yield, direct seeding saves almost 6 times of fuel and 4 times time save. The highest yield was found as 7400 kg ha - 1 in the minimum tillage method. I in which heavy-duty disk harrow with tillage combination used. Direct seeding has the lowest yield with 6800 kg ha - 1. This was due to the fact that weed manifestation was high in direct seeding comparing the other methods. The yield for conventional method was 7200 kg ha - 1...|$|E
2500|$|The Jumbo Jet, {{like all}} {{electric}} <b>spiral</b> lift <b>roller</b> coasters, {{reached the top}} of its lift hill by way of a gently-graded spiraling helix, before beginning its first drop. Unlike many roller coasters, which use a traditional chain lift, the Jumbo Jet was propelled with small wheel motors up the incline of the helix. These sort of coasters soon became a very common type of steel roller coaster in the 1970s, and were distinguished from later steel roller coaster designs that were characterized by their thicker, tubular-steel tracks. After climbing the [...] spiral lift, riders plunge into a series of tight turns using a figure-eight pattern and ending with a double-helix. When it debuted, Jumbo Jet was billed as the fastest of its kind and was known for its views of Lake Erie and steeply banked turns (some at up to 70 degrees).|$|R
5000|$|... 1995 saw the {{addition}} of Viper, a steel <b>spiral</b> looping <b>roller</b> coaster similar to Ultra Twister and in Ultra Twister's old spot, bringing the coaster count to five again. 1996 saw {{the addition}} of an indoor themed junior roller coaster called Skull Mountain. In 1997, a multiple looping dual track shuttle coaster called Batman & Robin: The Chiller was built but only opened {{for a day and}} encountered more technical difficulties. This coaster ended up not opening again until the spring of 1998. This coaster ran rather rough and was referred to as a [...] "headbanger" [...] as was Viper, {{and to a lesser extent}} The Scream Machine. The Mine Train and Rolling Thunder were also rough rides by then. Also, many flat rides were removed over the years and the park was showing signs of wear and tear, as well as obsolete attractions.|$|R
