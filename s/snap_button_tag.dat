40|$|The {{readability}} of {{two different}} types of electronic identifiers (EID) were evaluated under pastoral production system in North-Eastern Kenya. Physical verification and reading was done at day 0, and 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 months respectively on a total of 1943 beef cattle of which 934 were <b>tagged</b> using ear <b>button</b> <b>tags</b> and 1009 with rumen boluses. The retention rates were recorded and readability determined using a hand-held reader and subsequently compared using a non parametric survival analysis. The results showed that, rumen boluses were more effective with retention and readability of 100 % after the one-year period. The retention rate for ear <b>button</b> <b>tags</b> deteriorated after day 120 to 94. 6 %. This implied that rumen boluses are safe and tamper-proof and are thus recommended for use in pastoral production systems. When tested within the model Livestock Identification and Traceability System (LITS), the use of RFID identifiers were able to substantially contribute to better record keeping, and proof of credible livestock certification. However, due to cost considerations, undertaking a benefit-cost analysis and provisional analysis of the institutional and organisational infrastructure may be critical for successful implementation...|$|R
40|$|The {{technology}} for electronic identification (ID) of bovines is currently available {{with the advent}} of passive electronic transponders. At issue is the most appropriate method to attach the electronic ID to the animals. The options include an electronic <b>button</b> <b>tag</b> in the ear, an implantable electronic chip in the ear base or an electronic bolus placed in the rumen/reticular via the oesophageal route. • Aseries of experiments which compared different implantation sites for electronic chips found that the most suitable site for implantation was under the scutellar cartridge of the ear. This site gave very good retention values and was also a secure site, however, {{it was not possible to}} palpate the transponder. • The recovery of injectable transponders post slaughter was problematic and as a result due to potential risk of implantable transponder entering the food chain it was not possible to recommend the injectable (implantable route). • Electronic rumen boluses with a specific density less than 2 were rapidly expelled from the rumen, with 100 % expulsion by day 56 following placement in the reticulo-rumen. • Rumen boluses with a specific density of 2. 75 and greater had an annual non reading rate of less than 1 %, however, the loss rate in adult beef cows was greater than in growing and finishing cattle. The reason for this difference was unclear and may be diet related. • Recovery of boluses at slaughter was undertaken in the offal hall and generally the bolus was present in the reticulum and was easily detected by palpating the reticulum. One hundred percent recovery was not achieved in practice, various unforseen events including accidental dislodgment and cutting techniques prevented recovery. • Abolus dispenser with a long connection will facilitate delivery of the bolus directly to the calf’s reticulum. • Electronic failure of transponders in the reticulo-rumen was not a problem and read-failure rate was associated with boluses expelled from the reticulo-rumen. • There was no differences in read-failure rate (or loss rate) between two commercial boluses which were compared in different catgories of cattle. • Electronic <b>button</b> <b>tags</b> from two commercial companies were compared and it was found that any difference between the electronic <b>button</b> ear <b>tags</b> was associated with a defective applicator taggers. • Overall, the animal loss rate for electronic <b>button</b> <b>tags</b> was somewhat higher than that reported for electronic rumen boluses.

40|$|American {{horseshoe}} crabs Limulus polyphemus were tracked using acoustic telemetry {{and traditional}} tagging in a semi-enclosed bay on Cape Cod (Pleasant Bay), Massachusetts, USA, to determine seasonal movement patterns. Fifty-five actively spawning females were fitted with transmitters in 2008 and 2009 and were tracked using acoustic telemetry from May 2008 through July 2010. Fifteen crabs with transmitters also had archive depth-temperature tags attached. In addition, over 2000 spawning crabs (males and females) were tagged with US Fish and Wildlife (USFWS) <b>button</b> <b>tags</b> {{over the same}} period. Ninety-one percent of the crabs with transmitters were detected during this study. In the spring, crabs were primarily located in the northern section of the bay near spawning beaches, whereas in the fall crabs moved towards the deeper portions of the bay, and some may have overwintered in the bay. There was evidence that a majority (58 %- 71 %) of the females with transmitters spawned in two sequential seasons. One archive tag was recovered resulting in a year-long continuous record of depth and temperature data that, when integrated with telemetry data, indicated that the crab overwintered in the bay. The live recapture rate of crabs with USFWS <b>button</b> <b>tags</b> was 11 %, with all re-sighted crabs except one observed inside Pleasant Bay. Eighty-three percent of recaptures were found within 2. 5 km of the tagging location, and 51 % were observed at the same beach where they were tagged.

40|$|Abstract NetBytes Host Viewer is an {{interactive}} visualization tool designed {{to show the}} historical network flow data per port of an individual host machine or subnet on a network over time, using a 3 D impulse graph plot. Such visualizations allow network administrators to quickly and effectively diagnose infected or malfunctioning computers by viewing data transmission patterns for each port on the entity. NetBytes has a set of interactive features which help {{to deal with the}} problems associated with displaying a 3 D graph on a 2 D screen. First, NetBytes offers a “selector ” mode which allows the user to highlight specific ports (or times) on the graph using a slider and <b>snap</b> <b>buttons.</b> From the selector, the user can launch a set of 2 D graphs (Bytes vs. Time and Bytes vs. Ports) to acquire more detailed information about the host with less clutter. Lastly, the user is able to rotate the 3 D graph in any direction to mitigate occlusion. The long term objectives of this work include the integration of the NetBytes Viewer with complementary visualizations of the overall network. This application will integrate with a larger network analysis tool and be utilized as a drill-down mechanism. 1...|$|R

Due to the somewhat fragile nature of the uniform, however, the M42 was often reinforced with thicker, tougher canvas on the elbows, crotch and knees. The M42 was mostly worn by Paratroops assigned to Airborne units. The M42 was eventually phased out in favor of the new M-1943 Uniform which was a darker green, OD #7. Despite this, various individuals chose to keep their M42s in order to show their veteran status.|$|R

40|$|Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a {{progressive}} muscular disease. Active hand orthoses can greatly {{improve the quality}} of life of people with DMD. Surface Electromyography (sEMG) is commonly used for the control of active devices. The interfacing between the human and the sensor is regularly done by an adhesive skin interface (sticker). This can cause discomfort, especially during daily use. For forearm sEMG measurements, a sleeve design can solve this problem. The design presented here aims to make sEMG more comfortable, yet functional for daily use. In order to achieve that, we designed a simple, low-cost sEMG sleeve using a commercial ankle brace. 6 equidistant cuts around the circumference of the sleeve were made in order for the sEMG sensors (Delsys Trigno, Delsys Inc.) to be placed. Those are held in place by a number of 3 D printed plastic casings mounted with plastic <b>snap</b> <b>buttons.</b> The buttons are used to make the attachment of the casings fast and easy. A preliminary evaluation of the sleeve has been carried out with 6 healthy subjects, using a library of 6 and 9 gestures and a simple artificial neural network (ANN) classifier. The performance was evaluated, in terms of classification time, training time and accuracy (offline) and selection time, completion time, completion rate and accuracy (online). The results show that the performance of the sleeve is not significantly different than the adhesive skin interface. We conclude, that the EMG-sleeve is a better alternative than the current methods for sensor skin interfacing, while having similar performance during a classification task...|$|R
