[...] Sterilization can be achieved through various means, including: heat, chemicals, irradiation, high pressure, and filtration. Sterilization is distinct from disinfection, sanitization, and pasteurization in that sterilization kills, deactivates, or eliminates all forms of life and other biological agents which are present.|$|E

To be considered as a [...] "quality wine", the wine must come from a <b>specified</b> <b>region</b> and be associated with a [...] "geographical indication" [...] or appellation: indeed, the technical term used in the Regulation is quality wine psr, with the [...] "psr" [...] standing for [...] "produced in a specified region".
