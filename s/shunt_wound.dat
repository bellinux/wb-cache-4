50|$|Universal motors are series wound. Shunt winding {{was used}} experimentally, {{in the late}} 19th century, but was {{impractical}} owing to problems with commutation. Various schemes of embedded resistance, inductance and antiphase cross-coupling were attempted to reduce this. Universal motors, including <b>shunt</b> <b>wound,</b> were favoured as AC motors at this time as they were self-starting. When self-starting induction motors and automatic starters became available, these replaced the larger universal motors (above 1 hp) and the <b>shunt</b> <b>wound.</b>|$|E

50|$|A DC motor's {{speed and}} torque {{characteristics}} {{vary according to}} three different magnetization sources, separately excited field, self-excited field or permanent-field, which are used selectively to control the motor over the mechanical load's range.

40|$|A case {{of tension}} pneumocephalus {{following}} ventriculo-peritoneal shunt is reported. A 28 -year-old male was admitted with {{the diagnosis of}} arteriovenous malformation at the right temporooccipital lobe. Uneventful total removal of the arteriovenous malformation was performed. However,postoperatively symptoms of arterial vasospasm and progressive hydrocephalus developed, so a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt was inserted. The postoperative course was good, but about 3 weeks after the operation, the clinical symptoms aggravated gradually and computerized tomography scan showed expanding intraventricular air. At the reoperation, a small skin defect covered by crust was found at the <b>shunt</b> surgery <b>wound,</b> and the dura mater around the shunting tube remained as a defective space. It was suspected that the air invaded the lateral ventricles along the shunting tube through the skin and dura defect. Twelve similar cases {{could be found in}} the literature...|$|R

Introduction: The dynamo tested is a 1. 5 K. W. machine generating 115 volts {{at a speed}} of 1850 R. P. M. and is short <b>shunt</b> compound <b>wound.</b> It is constructed so as to require little care, having self oiling ring bearings and brushes {{that do not require}} shifting with increase of load. The terminal block {{on the side of the}} machine is arranged so simply that no mistake could be made in making the connections. External Characteristic. The curve following shows the external characteristic of the dynamo. In obtaining the data for this curve the dynamo was run at constant speed. The rheostat in the shunt field was adjusted so that a voltmeter placed across the terminals reads 110 volts when the dynamo is running without load. The position of the rheostat arm is not changed during the test. A variable resistance and an ammeter are placed in the external circuit. The resistance is decreased, thus increasing the load until the limit of the machine is reached. Readings are taken simultaneously of line amperes and terminal volts for a number of intermediate points. This data is plotted with terminal volts as ordinates and line amperes as abscissas. The object of compounding a dynamo is to maintain a constant voltage at some point on the circuit. The voltage of a shunt dynamo gradually falls as the load increases, therefore in order to maintain a constant potential regulation of the rheostat would be necessary. By compounding the regulation is automatic and no adjustment of the rheostat is necessary...|$|R
5000|$|In {{a series}} wound motor, the field coils are {{connected}} electrically {{in series with}} the armature coils (via the brushes). In a <b>shunt</b> <b>wound</b> motor, the field coils are connected in parallel, or [...] "shunted" [...] to the armature coils. In a separately excited (sepex) motor the field coils are supplied from an independent source, such as a motor-generator and the field current is unaffected by changes in the armature current. The sepex system was sometimes used in DC traction motors to facilitate control of wheelslip.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was constructed}} {{on an old}} 40 ft bogie truck underframe. The producer gas generator was constructed from the smokebox section of a scrapped 6th Class locomotive's boiler. Smokebox char was used as fuel and the gas was passed from the gas generator through suitable wet scrubbers to remove tar to two Tilling-Stevens petrol engines. The engines came from Whippet tanks and {{were obtained from the}} Defence Department. A gas expansion chamber was constructed from an old chimney. The two engines drove <b>shunt</b> <b>wound</b> dynamos, obtained from General Electric, to power the traction motors which were two tramway motors obtained from De Beers in Kimberley. Since the gas was generated by the suction from the two internal combustion engines, the vehicle became known as a suction gas locomotive.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{examples}} of this system were the front-wheel drive conversions of horse-drawn cabs by Louis Antoine Krieger in Paris in the 1890s. The Krieger electric landaulet had a drive motor in each front wheel with {{a second set of}} parallel windings (bifilar coil) for regenerative braking. In England, the Raworth system of [...] "regenerative control" [...] was introduced by tramway operators in the early 1900s, since it offered them economic and operational benefits as explained by A. Raworth of Leeds in some detail. These included tramway systems at Devonport (1903), Rawtenstall, Birmingham, Crystal Palace-Croydon (1906), and many others. Slowing the speed of the cars or keeping it in control on descending gradients, the motors worked as generators and braked the vehicles. The tram cars also had wheel brakes and track slipper brakes which could stop the tram should the electric braking systems fail. In several cases the tram car motors were <b>shunt</b> <b>wound</b> instead of series wound, and the systems on the Crystal Palace line utilized series-parallel controllers. Following a serious accident at Rawtenstall, an embargo was placed on this form of traction in 1911; the regenerative braking system was reintroduced 20 years later.|$|E
50|$|A Ward Leonard {{control is}} usually used for {{controlling}} a <b>shunt</b> or compound <b>wound</b> DC motor, and {{developed as a}} method of providing a speed-controlled motor from an AC supply, though it is not without its advantages in DC schemes. The AC supply is used to drive an AC motor, usually an induction motor that drives a DC generator or dynamo. The DC output from the armature is directly connected to the armature of the DC motor (sometimes but not always of identical construction). The shunt field windings of both DC machines are independently excited through variable resistors. Extremely good speed control from standstill to full speed, and consistent torque, can be obtained by varying the generator and/or motor field current. This method of control was the de facto method from its development until it was superseded by solid state thyristor systems. It found service in almost any environment where good speed control was required, from passenger lifts through to large mine pit head winding gear and even industrial process machinery and electric cranes. Its principal disadvantage was that three machines were required to implement a scheme (five in very large installations, as the DC machines were often duplicated and controlled by a tandem variable resistor). In many applications, the motor-generator set was often left permanently running, to avoid the delays that would otherwise be caused by starting it up as required. Although electronic (thyristor) controllers have replaced most small to medium Ward-Leonard systems, some very large ones (thousands of horsepower) remain in service. The field currents are much lower than the armature currents, allowing a moderate sized thyristor unit to control a much larger motor than it could control directly. For example, in one installation, a 300 amp thyristor unit controls the field of the generator. The generator output current is in excess of 15,000 amperes, which would be prohibitively expensive (and inefficient) to control directly with thyristors.|$|R
40|$|Progress is {{reported}} {{in the development of}} complete electric vehicle propulsion systems, and the results of tests on the Road Load Simulator of two such systems representative of advanced dc and ac drive technology are presented. One is the system used in the DOE's ETV- 1 integrated test vehicle which consists of a <b>shunt</b> <b>wound</b> dc traction motor under microprocessor control using a transistorized controller. The motor drives the vehicle through a fixed ratio transmission. The second system uses an ac induction motor controlled by transistorized pulse width modulated inverter which drives through a two speed automatically shifted transmission. The inverter and transmission both operate under the control of a microprocessor. The characteristics of these systems are also compared with the propulsion system technology available in vehicles being manufactured at the inception of the DOE program and with an advanced, highly integrated propulsion system upon which technology development was recently initiated...|$|E
