2500|$|In {{agriculture}} and gardening, the germination rate describes how many seeds {{of a particular}} plant species, variety or seedlot are likely to germinate over a given period. It {{is a measure of}} germination time course and is usually expressed as a percentage, e.g., an 85% germination rate indicates that about 85 out of 100 seeds will probably germinate under proper conditions over the germination period given. The germination rate is useful for calculating the seed requirements for a given area or desired number of plants. In seed physiologists and seed scientists [...] "germination rate" [...] is the reciprocal of time taken for the process of germination to complete starting from time of sowing. On the other hand, the number of seed able to complete germination in a population (i.e. <b>seed</b> <b>lot)</b> is referred as germination capacity.|$|E

50|$|Among the {{individual}} white spruce within a stand, height growth varies greatly, {{often with a}} coefficient of variation in height of about 30% (Stiell 1955).

40|$|Aged switchgrass <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> {{can display}} {{various levels of}} {{dormancy}}. Under-standing the causes for this dormancy will provide better insight into seed physiology, and potentially lead to treatments that reduce variability in seed germination assays. The effects of sodium nitroprusside, potassium ferro-cyanide and hydrogen peroxide on the germination of eight aged switch-grass (Panicum virgatum L.) <b>seed</b> <b>lots,</b> seven of which were produced {{in the same year}} at a single experiment station, were examined. Seed germination demonstrated a significant <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> × days and treatments × days effect. However, responses of individual <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> to specific chemicals varied considerably. Genetically related <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> did not display similar responses to the treatments, while switchgrass derived from a different germplasm exhibited a more similar response. Coleoptile emergence was significantly improved by chemical treatments and showed a significant <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> × treatment interaction. Together, these results indicate (1) chemicals releasing re-active nitrogen species or peroxide can overcome residual dormancy and stimulate seed germination and coleoptile emergence in diverse switchgrassseed lots, and (2) multiple mechanisms, to some extent under genetic control, appear to direct switchgrass seed germination...|$|R

Multivariate techniques allow understanding structural dependence contained in each variable, as well as characterize groups of <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> according to specific standards. The study aimed at evaluating variability among soybean <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> and discriminate these lots by multivariate exploratory techniques as function of seed vigor. Experiment was performed with 20 soybean <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> (10 lots cv. BRS Valiosa RR and 10 lots cv. M-SOY 7908 RR). Seed physiological potential was assessed by testing for: germination (standard, and under different water availability); vigor (accelerated aging and electrical conductivity); and field seedling emergence. Cluster analysis of <b>seed</b> <b>lots,</b> as well as Principal Component Analysis was performed using data obtained on all tests. Multivariate techniques allowed stratifying <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> into two distinct groups.

40|$|Some of the {{consequences}} of seed deterioration can be a reduction in field emergence and stand establishment, retarded plant growth and reduced seed yield. From the available literature {{it is not clear whether}} the reported lower seed yields are solely a consequence of lower population density resulting from low vigour seed and hence poor emergence, or are a result of poor individual performance of plants grown from low vigour seed. Two high vigour <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> of shrunken- 2 super sweet corn (Zea mays L.) cv. Illini Gold were artificially aged to obtain differential vigour levels (high and low vigour <b>seed</b> <b>lots).</b> These <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> were then used to study the effects of seed vigour on field emergence and emergence rate, vegetative and reproductive growth and development, and seed yield and quality. The quality of unaged and aged <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> was judged by the use of standard germination, health and vigour tests. This last category included seedling growth and evaluation tests, eg seedling growth test; stress tests, eg cold germination, soil cold test, complex stress vigour test (CSVT) and soak germination test; and biochemical tests, eg electroconductivity, respiration and tetrazolium tests. The two high vigour <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> differed significantly (P < 0. 05) in thousand seed weight and mechanical damage levels, but not in their germination and vigour performance. However, both these <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> were heavily infected by Fusarium subglutinans. The internally-borne Fusarium subglutinans survived the high temperature employed during the artificial ageing treatment, and was able to cause severe damage in the deteriorated <b>seed</b> <b>lots.</b> Aged <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> demonstrated a decrease in germination and vigour as illustrated by a slower rate of seedling growth and accumulation of dry weight, an increase in electroconductivity leakage, a decrease in respiratory oxygen uptake and an increase in respiratory quotients. Interestingly, however, the performance of these <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> in the soil cold test, cold gemination test, and low temperature respiration test, did not differ significantly from that of the unaged <b>seed</b> <b>lots,</b> presumably because the activity of the seed-borne Fusarium subglutinans was reduced by low temperature (10 °C or less). This cultivar has some cold tolerance and exposing <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> to low temperature did not cause the extent of physiological disorder expected, possibly because of adaptive protection mechanisms that allowed the seeds to undertake some cellular repair. Field emergence and emergence rates were poor but did not differ significantly between high and low vigour <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> over three spring sowings at the same site, probably because the environment exerted little stress, but more probably because the effects of both seed-borne and soil-borne Fusarium spp on chemically untreated seeds masked any other seed quality differences. As a consequence, no seed quality test was significantly related to field emergence, with the exception of the CSVT which was significantly (P < 0. 05) correlated with field emergence for the November sowing. A greater (P < 0. 05) loss of plants from low vigour <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> due to post emergence damping-off and seedling blight caused by seed-borne and soil-borne pathogens was recorded in the October and December sowings, with the result that plant population was significantly reduced when compared to that of high vigour lots. While the reason for this increased loss was not explained conclusively, it is possible that seedlings produced from low vigour seeds were less able to withstand the fungal attack. However, in plants which survived there were no differences in heterotrophic plant growth as demonstrated by similarities in leaf, stem and plant dry weight at the 3 rd leaf stage for all <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> within any one sowing date. Significant sowing date effects were recorded, however, during autotrophic growth (5 th leaf stage), the performance of high vigour <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> (measured as leaf, stem and plant dry weight) was significantly (P < 0. 05) superior to that of low vigour <b>seed</b> <b>lots.</b> However, these differences decreased as the plants grew and were no longer present at the 7 th leaf stage, because plants from low vigour <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> had produced thicker tillers. From silking on, no significant differences among populations were recorded as grain filling rate and days to maximum grain dry weight did not differ. However, for the two sowings (October and December) when plant population differed significantly, plants grown from the low vigour <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> significantly (P < 0. 05) outyielded those grown from high vigour <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> because the former compensated for lost plants by producing more tillers and hence reproductive parts. The seed vigour status of the parent did not affect the seed vigour of the progeny as demonstrated by similarities in seed quality, vigour and field performance among <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> of freshly harvested seeds. However, seed quality differed with sowing date, with seed harvested from the November and December sowings having a significantly (P < 0. 05) lower quality than that from the October sowing. These results should be treated with caution, because seed quality from all harvests was poor, due to heavy infection of seeds by Fusarium species and also damage incurred during drying. The performance of the original <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> after storage for 14 months showed that the high vigour <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> had a significantly (P < 0. 05) higher germinability, vigour and field performance in comparison with their pre-storage performance because the occurrence and activity of Fusarium subglutinans which was rampant in unstored <b>seed</b> <b>lots,</b> decrease considerably following storage. Although seed-borne pathogens also decreased in low vigour <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> after storage, the deterioration originally induced by the accelerated ageing had increased. For stored <b>seed</b> <b>lots,</b> a significant relationship existed between field emergence and both the standard germination and cold germination tests. The results from both the laboratory tests and field trials were confounded by Fusarium subglutinans and other fungi. This work should be repeated in the absence of particularly seed-borne pathogens before any definite conclusions can be drawn...|$|R

[...] A pH of 4.5 to 7.0 is preferred for growing jalapeños and keeping the soil well drained is essential for keeping the plants healthy. Jalapeños need at least 6 to 8 hours of sunlight per day. Experimental results show that unlike bell peppers at least 7.5 millimolar (mM) Nitrogen is needed for optimal pod production and 15 to 22 mM Nitrogen produces the best result, the plant produces both more leaves and more pods, rather than just more leaves. Once picked, individual peppers may turn to red of their own accord. The peppers can be eaten green or red. Though usually grown as an annual they are perennial and if protected from frost can produce during multiple years, as with all Capsicum annuum.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate why guayule <b>seed</b> and <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> vary significantly in quality. The laboratory and greenhouse experiments involved separation of seed based on physical attributes (diameter, color and weight) and the confirmation of internal structures (embryo and endosperm) by x-ray analysis. The effect of different conditioning treatments on <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> was also tested. Separation of seed by size (diameter) was shown to be less efficient than separation by color. Color was the most effective means of separating heavier and darker (opaque-black and gray color grades) seed, and these seed were confirmed to be filled, containing internal structures by x-ray analysis. Germination percentage and rate were greater for seed with these characteristics than for yellow and bright-black seed, which are lighter and predominately partially filled or unfilled. Conditioning treatments used for guayule seed older than two years had no effect on seed germination and emergence percentage or rate.

Twelve SSR markers were used to determine the genetic purity of 23 grower-retained <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> of cv. Sunvale. Sixteen of the 23 grower-retained Sunvale <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> (70 %) contained at least 5 % contamination from a different genotype, while seven samples (30 %) contained > 10 % contamination. The SSR analysis was complemented by field observations of the various <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> in a replicated small plot trial. In 17 of the 19 grower-retained Sunvale <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> that had some level of contamination with another genotype(s), at least one contaminant was very susceptible to stripe rust. The pure Sunvale plants in the plots showed a moderately resistant reaction. This is the first report of seed impurity being definitively determined as the cause of unexpected stripe rust responses within a wheat variety. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of different vigor tests to assess S. commersoniana seeds physiological quality during storage. Therefore, seeds were stored in cloth bags, plastic bags and glass containers for 531 days, both at room temperature and in a cold chamber. Periodically samples were taken and the following tests were conducted: standard germination, germination speed index, first count after germination, seedlings fresh and dry matter, electrical conductivity (imbibitions for 2 and 24 hours) and accelerated aging, in order to monitoring the seeds physiologic quality. Data were submitted to polynomial regression analysis, {{for each of the}} combination of packaging/storage condition. The results obtained led to the following considerations: a) the speed germination index and the accelerated aging test permitted a good evaluation of the seed-lots quality; b) the first count of germination did not allow any prediction about <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> vigor; c) seedling fresh and dry matter did not discriminate among seed lots; d) electrical conductivity test after 2 h imbibitions was not adequate to evaluate the <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> vigor and e) the electric conductivity test with 24 h imbibitions was more adequate to differentiate among <b>seed</b> <b>lots,</b> but with little efficiency to discriminate among <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> with intermediate vigor or with low quality differences...|$|R
40|$|Anogeissus leiocarpa is an {{important}} economical and cultural species which is used for dyeing cotton fabric and for reforestation and restoration plantings in West Africa, where it is protected. Its natural regeneration is nearly non-existent and the species is continually exploited. Hence, propagation has emerged {{as an alternative to}} its conservation, although limited by the very low germination of its seeds. We aimed to increase the quality of seed lots to support community forestry, investigating how mechanical gravimetric and immersion seed sorting influence germination rate, and we correlated germination responses with physical characteristics to better typify a quality <b>seed</b> <b>lot.</b> For immersing, water was the best separation medium, resulting in a <b>seed</b> <b>lot</b> with 19 % germination against 9 % for the unsorted seeds. Mechanical sorting through air-flows allowed separating initial seed lots into sorted lots that were on average 4 % by weight of the initial, unsorted <b>seed</b> <b>lot.</b> The final sorted batches had 89 % germination and an additional sulphuric acid pre-treatment improved germination of these seeds to 100 %, which has never been obtained for this species before. The gravimetric mechanical and immersion sorting are efficient in separating out highly viable seeds and could be used for large seed lots...|$|E

40|$|Genebank {{managers}} conduct viability {{tests on}} stored seeds {{so they can}} replace lots that have viability near a critical threshold, such as 50 or 85 % germination. Currently, these tests are typically scheduled at uniform intervals; testing every 5 years is common. A manager needs to balance {{the cost of an}} additional test against the possibility of losing a <b>seed</b> <b>lot</b> due to late retesting. We developed a data-informed method to schedule viability tests for a collection of 2, 833 maize seed lots with 3 to 7 completed viability tests per lot. Given these historical data reporting on seed viability at arbitrary times, we fit a hierarchical Bayesian seed-viability model with random <b>seed</b> <b>lot</b> specific coefficients. The posterior distribution of the predicted time to cross below a critical threshold was estimated for each <b>seed</b> <b>lot.</b> We recommend a predicted quantile as a retest time, chosen to balance the importance of catching quickly decaying lots against the cost of premature tests. The method can be used with any seed-viability model; we focused on two, the Avrami viability curve and a quadratic curve that accounts for seed after-ripening. After fitting both models, we found that the quadratic curve gave more plausible predictions than did the Avrami curve. Also, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and a follow-up test demonstrated that a 0. 05 quantile yields reasonable predictions...|$|E

40|$|A {{monoclonal}} antibody specific for Xanthomonas campestris pathovars in the translucens group, including X. c. pv. undulosa, the causal agent of bacterial leaf streak or black chaff in wheat and triticale, {{was used in}} immunofluorescence and a dot-immunobinding assay to detect pathogens in aqueous seed extracts. These techniques were compared to dilution plating of seed wash water as potential routine seed-indexing methods. Twenty-six cereal <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> were harvested from plants with different levels of natural disease incidence grown in three locations in Mexico. Among the 26 <b>lots</b> analyzed, pathogen-free <b>seed</b> came from clean fields principally in Ciudad Obregon, where conditions are less favorable for its development. Pathogen populations detected with dilution plate ranged from 1. 3 X 10 (4) to 5. 3 X 10 (6) cfu/g of air-dry weight. Populations were recovered from <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> that had been stored for 3 yr. Some discrepancies in pathogen detection occurred among the different methods used. <b>Seed</b> <b>lots</b> with high pathogen populations were consistently identified with all three methods. Differences in detection thresholds were found with seed wash water as compared to reference strain from pure culture. Apparently {{a substantial number of}} dead cells were present in wash water from some <b>seed</b> <b>lots.</b> Immunofluorescence was more sensitive than dot-immunobinding assay and produced more reproducible results. It is proposed as a standard for indexing germ plasm. Because of the high variation in data, direct counts of fluorescent bacterial cells under UV microscopy will probably not be necessary for identifying infected seed. It is recommended that immunofluorescence-positive <b>seed</b> <b>lots</b> should not be considered for sowing in areas favorable for disease development...|$|R
