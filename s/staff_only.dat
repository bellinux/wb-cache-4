As a theatre commander, he was answerable directly to the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) and commanded ground, naval and air forces, but this was of little importance at first as most German units were under Italian operational control.|$|E
5|$|The Las Vegas {{situation}} {{was one of}} a bevy of developments that absorbed the league in the 1994 to 1995 offseason. The team was not officially disbanded until April 1995 but not before the league damaged its credibility by twice giving provisional approval to a relocation to Jackson, Mississippi, {{to the point where the}} Mississippi team was included on the 1995 internal schedule and had hired a general manager and coaching <b>staff,</b> <b>only</b> to have the deal collapse amid squabbles with the Las Vegas corporation that owned the Posse. A group from Miami, Florida tried to convince the league to let it buy the remains of the Posse and move them to South Florida as the Miami Manatees in the Miami Orange Bowl. An exhibition game between Birmingham and Baltimore was held there in June 1995 to gauge support, which drew a decent crowd just above 20,000.|$|E

They were banned from returning to Bangladesh. The coup was planned by disgruntled Awami League colleagues and military officers, which included Mujib's colleague and former confidanté Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad, who became his immediate successor. There was intense speculation in the media accusing the US Central Intelligence Agency of having instigated the plot.

25|$|The U.S. Navy {{was aware}} of the {{traditional}} planning of the Imperial Japanese Navy for war with the U.S., as maintained throughout the 1930s and into the 1940s. The Japanese made no secret of it, and in the 1930s American radio intelligence gave U.S. war planners considerable insight in Japanese naval exercises. These plans presumed there would be a large decisive battle between Japanese and U.S. battleships, but this would be fought near Japan, after the numerical superiority of the U.S. Pacific Fleet (assured by the Washington Naval Treaty, and still taken as given) was whittled down by primarily night attacks by light forces, such as destroyers and submarines. This strategy expected the Japanese fleet to take a defensive posture, awaiting U.S. attack, and it was confirmed by the Japanese Navy <b>staff</b> <b>only</b> three weeks before Pearl Harbor. In the 1920s, the decisive battle was supposed to happen near the Ryukyu islands; in 1940 it was expected to occur in the central Pacific, near the Marshall islands. War Plan Orange reflected this in its own planning for an advance across the Pacific. Yamamoto's decision to shift the focus of the confrontation with the U.S. as far east as Pearl Harbor, and to use his aircraft carriers to cripple the American battleships, was a radical enough departure from previous doctrine to leave analysts in the dark.|$|E

500|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War in 1861, Covell entered the Confederate States Army with the rank of major and served on the staff of Brigadier General Henry A. Wise. Covell served on General Wise's <b>staff</b> <b>only</b> briefly before the state of Virginia recalled him to the Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind in 1862 to become the institution's principal. According to the National Conference of Superintendents and Principals of Institutions for Deaf Mutes in 1888, the state of Virginia considered Covell's services [...] "of more value as manager of one of her noblest public institutions than as a soldier in the field." [...] While serving as principal, Covell continued to head and instruct in the school's Deaf Mute Department. Covell remained principal of the Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind for nine years until his resignation from the institution in 1872.|$|E

During the American Civil War, Covell entered the Confederate States Army with the rank of major and served {{on the staff of}} Brigadier General Henry A. Wise. Covell served on General Wise's <b>staff</b> <b>only</b> briefly before returning to the Virginia School for the Deaf and Blind to serve as its principal in 1862, a position he held until 1872. In 1874, Covell was selected to serve as the principal of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind. Under his leadership, the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind experienced [...] "unprecedented success" [...] and its student body began to grow due to his initiatives. He served as the institution's principal until his death in 1887.|$|E
500|$|In October 1962, Taylor {{was offered}} the manager's job at Burton Albion after impressing {{chairman}} Trevor Grantham with his knowledge and theories on the game. In summer 1963 he oversaw a complete overhaul of the playing <b>staff,</b> <b>only</b> retaining four players, and completely rebuilt the squad. He signed strikers Richie Barker and Stan Round, who would score a combined 308 goals for the club, and remain the club's two highest goalscorers (as of 2016). He survived calls for his resignation after a defeat to Kidderminster Harriers in the FA Cup {{and went on to}} create {{one of the most successful}} sides in Burton's history, beating Weymouth to win the Southern League Cup in 1964. In 1965, he walked out on a newly signed £34 a week three-year contract at Burton to become Clough's assistant manager at Hartlepools United on wages of £24 a week. He later admitted the decision, which he took against the advice of his friends and family, was [...] "against all logic". His successor, Alex Tait, led Burton to promotion out of the Southern League Division One in 1965–66.|$|E
500|$|The main {{bridge over}} the Lufira to Jadotville had been {{destroyed}} after the local mercenary commander blew up a truck parked halfway across it. Most of his men then promptly deserted. The UN troops stopped to await the arrival of American bridging equipment, until they discovered a sabotaged rail bridge [...] upstream that was still passable on foot. Brigadier Noronha, acting as the local commander, seized the opportunity and ordered the bridge to be secured. The Rajputana infantry crossed the bridge and swiftly neutralized Katangese opposition {{on the far side}} of the river. Meanwhile, the Madras battalion located a raft and, with the assistance of a Sikorsky helicopter, brought over most of their vehicles and heavy equipment. Not wanting to remain at an exposed bridgehead, Noronha had his troops occupy Jadotville. General Moke had attempted to organise a defence of the town, but Katangese forces were in disarray, being completely caught off-guard by the UN troops' advance. The Indian soldiers faced no resistance and were warmly welcomed by the local inhabitants and UMHK mining <b>staff.</b> <b>Only</b> when Noronha was in the town did he contact the UN headquarters in Léopoldville. UN forces briefly stayed in Jadotville to regroup before advancing on Kolwezi, Sakania, and Dilolo.|$|E

500|$|Sound {{effects from}} {{previous}} games, {{such as that}} of the judge's gavel, were remade for Dual Destinies: Toshihiko Horiyama, the game's sound director, re-imagined the original [...] "crisp and dry" [...] gavel effect as one where the initial sound of the gavel peaks early, leading into the richer sound of the gavel's core. He went through a similar process for all the effects, trying to both preserve the original sounds and revitalize them. After Horiyama came up with a sound concept, the game's sound designer, Amagishi, created the sound based on it. Because of the improved hardware capabilities of the Nintendo 3DS compared to the Nintendo DS, the development team was able to use unprocessed sounds of real instruments at some points in the music, such as in the title track, which features Iwadare playing the trombone. A feature was implemented where the game detects whether headphones are plugged into the Nintendo 3DS, and it adjusts the audio output to be optimal for the player's current setup. While Capcom staff provided all voice acting in previous Ace Attorney games, Dual Destinies instead used professional voice actors, with some smaller roles being handled by Capcom <b>staff.</b> <b>Only</b> the cutscenes are fully voiced; this was a deliberate choice, as the developers wanted to give the player the freedom to read dialogue in whatever kind of voice they want in their head. Eshiro also said that full voice acting would ruin the game's pacing and tempo.|$|E

During the advance at the marshes at St.-Gond he is said to have declared: [...] "My centre is yielding. My right is retreating. Situation excellent. I am attacking." [...] These words were seen as a symbol both of Foch's leadership and of French determination to resist the invader at any cost, although {{there is little evidence that}} the signal was sent.

[...] The episode serves as the official season finale to season six, which Cohen described as being a decision made by Comedy Central. [...] Cohen considers all twenty-six episodes of the original order to comprise season six, since all the episodes were written and produced continuously, with no production gap between [...] "The Mutants Are Revolting" [...] and the remaining 14 episodes. [...] In recognition of the episode as the series' landmark 100th, the staff decided {{to write a story}} that [...] "had roots {{in the history of the}} show." [...] They ultimately decided on the story involving Leela fighting for the rights of her people, the mutants, since her mutant heritage was a longstanding storyline in the series.
