40|$|Economic theory {{points to}} five parties active in disciplining {{management}} of poorly performing firms: holders of large <b>share</b> <b>blocks,</b> acquirers of new blocks, bidders in take-overs, non-executive directors, and investors {{during periods of}} financial distress. This Paper reports the first comparative evaluation {{of the role of}} these different parties in the discipline of management. We find that, in the UK, most parties, including holders of substantial <b>share</b> <b>blocks,</b> exert little discipline and that some, for example, inside holders of <b>share</b> <b>blocks</b> and boards dominated by non-executive directors, actually impede it. Bidders replace a high proportion of management of companies acquired in take-overs but do not target poorly performing management. In contrast, during periods of financial constraints prompting distressed rights issues and capital restructuring, investors focus control on poorly performing companies. These results stand in contrast to the US, where there is little evidence of a role for new equity issues but non-executive directors and acquirers of <b>share</b> <b>blocks</b> perform a disciplinary function. The different governance outcomes are attributed to differences in minority investor protection in two countries with supposedly similar common law systems. board turnover; control; corporate governance; regulation; restructuring...|$|R

50|$|When a {{specific}} data {{is shared by}} several caches and a processor modifies {{the value of the}} shared data, the change must be propagated to all the other caches which have the same copy of the data. Otherwise, it may violate a cache coherency. The notification of data change can be done by bus snooping. All the snoopers monitor every transaction on a bus. If a transaction modifying a <b>shared</b> cache <b>block</b> appears on a bus, all the snoopers check whether their caches have the same copy of the <b>shared</b> <b>block.</b> If a cache has the copy of the <b>shared</b> <b>block,</b> the corresponding snooper performs an action to ensure cache coherency. The action can be a flush or an invalidation of the cache block. It also involves a change of cache block status depending on the cache coherence protocol.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{design of a}} {{multicast}} ATM switch using input and output link sharing. Switch inputs and outputs are grouped into small modules called Input <b>Shared</b> <b>Blocks</b> #ISBs# and Output <b>Shared</b> <b>blocks</b> #OSBs#, respectively. Link sharing among grouped inputs can solve output contention and avoid link starvation. Output link sharing eliminates the speedup requirement for the central switch fabric and provides optimal bu#er utilization. We propose two scheduling algorithms : Individual Virtual Output Queue Round Robin #IVOQ Round Robin#, and Grouped Virtual Output Queue Round Robin#GVOQ Round Robin#. Both schemes are based on group mapping from an ISB to an OSB, and reduce the scheduling complexity dramatically. This switch architecture can be easily extended to a large scale, high speed ATM switch enjoying Terabits capacity. Toevaluate the switch performance, we experiment a simulation for a 256 x 256 switch under various tra#c conditions. Simulations indicate [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In today's Computing world Cloud {{computing}} {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} innovation which uses advanced computational power and it improves data sharing and data storing capabilities. Main difficulty in cloud computing was issues of data integrity, data privacy and data access by unauthorised users. TTA (Trusted Third Party) is used to store and share data in cloud computing. Modification and sharing of data is quite simple as a group. To verify integrity of the shared data, members in the group needs to compute signatures on all <b>shared</b> data <b>blocks.</b> Different <b>blocks</b> in <b>shared</b> data are generally signed by different users due to data modifications performed by different users. User revocation {{is one of the}} biggest security threats in data sharing in groups. During user revocation <b>shared</b> data <b>block</b> signed by revoked user needs to download and re-sign by existing user. This task is very inefficacious due to the large size of <b>shared</b> data <b>blocks</b> on cloud. PANDA Plus is the new public auditing mechanism for the maintaining integrity of shared data with efficient user revocation in the cloud. This mechanism is based on proxy re-signatures concept which allows the cloud to re-sign blocks on behalf of existing users during user revocation, so that downloading of <b>shared</b> data <b>blocks</b> is not required. PANDA Plus is the public auditor which audits the integrity of shared data without retrieving the entire data from the cloud. It also monitor batch to verify multiple auditing tasks simultaneously...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a data reference modeling technique to estimate with high accuracy the cache miss ratio in eachecoherent multiprocessors. The technique involves analyzing the dynamic data referencing behavior of parallel algorithms. Data reference modeling first identifies {{different types of}} <b>shared</b> data <b>blocks</b> accessed during the execution of a parallel algorithm, then captures in a few parameters the cache behavior of each <b>shared</b> <b>block</b> {{as a function of}} the problem size, number of processors, and cache line size, and finally constructs an analytical expression for each algo- rithm to estimate the cache miss ratio. Because the number of processors, problem size, and cache line size are included as parameters, the expression for the cache miss ratio can be used to predict the performance of systems with different configurations. Six parallel algorithms are studied, and the analytical results compared against previously published simulation results, to establish the confidence level of the data reference modeling technique. It is found that the aver- age prediction error for four out of six algorithms is within five percent and within ten percent for the other two.
