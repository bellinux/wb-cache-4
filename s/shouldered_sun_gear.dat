50|$|An {{epicyclic}} gear train {{consists of two}} gears mounted so that the center of one gear revolves around {{the center of the}} other. A carrier connects the centers of the two gears and rotates to carry one gear, called the planet gear, around the other, called the <b>sun</b> <b>gear.</b> The planet and <b>sun</b> <b>gears</b> mesh so that their pitch circles roll without slip. A point on the pitch circle of the planet gear traces an epicycloid curve. In this simplified case, the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> is fixed and the planetary gear(s) roll around the <b>sun</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a carrier-less, anti-backlash {{planetary gear system}} that has an input <b>sun</b> <b>gear,</b> a force-balancing and planet-alignment 'speeder' <b>gear</b> above the <b>sun</b> <b>gear,</b> a split ring gear that has a fixed lower ring gear coaxial with the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> and a rotating upper ring gear also coaxial with the <b>sun</b> <b>gear.</b> A preload bolt is used for securing the split ring gears together. Within the split ring gear is an even number of planet gears between the split ring <b>gear</b> and the <b>sun</b> <b>gear.</b> Each planet gear consists of an upper planet gear, and lower planet gear with {{the upper and lower}} planet gears splined together and pushed apart by a spring which causes separation and relative twist between the upper and lower planet gears. The lower planet gear meshes with the input <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> and the fixed ring gear while the upper planet gear is driven by the lower planet gear and meshes with the rotating ring gear...|$|R
5000|$|The double {{planetary}} gear system incorporates an input <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> connected to the driver’s steering wheel, two planetary <b>gears,</b> an output <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> connected to the steering pinion, and a rotating housing. If the housing is held still, the driver’s steer inputs are translated from the input <b>sun</b> <b>gear,</b> thought the {{planetary gear}}s (sharing a common lay shaft) to the output <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> with a net 1:1 ratio. I.e. if the planetary gear housing is held still, conventional steering operation is retained. This characteristic provides a means of steering the vehicle {{in the event of}} an active steering system failure.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Two <b>sun</b> <b>gears</b> (not shown) {{fit inside}} this planet carrier. The <b>sun</b> <b>gears</b> are powered through {{clutches}} from the engine. One of {{three sets of}} three planet gears inside the carrier can be seen.|$|R
50|$|In one arrangement, the {{planetary}} carrier (green) is held stationary, and the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> (yellow) {{is used as}} input. In this case, {{the planetary}} gears simply rotate about their own axes (i.e., spin) at a rate determined {{by the number of}} teeth in each <b>gear.</b> If the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> has Ns teeth, and each planet gear has Np teeth, then the ratio is equal to −N/N. For instance, if the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> has 24 teeth, and each planet has 16 teeth, then the ratio is −24/16, or −3/2; this means that one clockwise turn of the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> produces 1.5 counterclockwise turns of each of the planet gear(s) about its axis.|$|R
5000|$|The {{combination}} of epicycle gear trains with a planet engaging both a <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> and {{a ring gear}} is called a planetary gear train. [...] In this case, the ring gear is usually fixed and the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> is driven.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that the}} axle {{of the planet}} gear {{is tied to the}} axle of the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> by a link that freely rotates around the axis of the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> and keeps the planet gear engaged with the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> but does not {{contribute}} to the drive torque. This link appears, at first sight, to be similar to a crank but the drive is not transmitted through it. Thus, it did not contravene the crank patent.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Input torque {{is applied}} to the ring gear (blue), which turns the entire carrier (blue). The carrier is {{connected}} to both <b>sun</b> <b>gears</b> (red and yellow) only through the planet gear (green). Torque is transmitted to the <b>sun</b> <b>gears</b> through the planet gear. The planet gear revolves around the axis of the carrier, driving the <b>sun</b> <b>gears.</b> If the resistance at both wheels is equal, the planet gear revolves without spinning about its own axis, and both wheels turn at the same rate.|$|R
40|$|Pitting {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes of failure in {{planetary}} gear sets of axles designed for agricultural vehicles. The high torque and the low wheel speed typical of such machines result in poor lubrication and promote the onset of contact fatigue failure by pitting, which generally occurs earlier in the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> than in both the planets and the ring of wheel hub planetary drives. In fact, <b>sun</b> <b>gears</b> are subjected to the highest contact pressure and, at the same time, unfavourable rolling-sliding working conditions. In this paper, six case hardened <b>sun</b> <b>gears</b> damaged by pitting during endurance tests were analysed. The aim of the analysis was to highlight the key aspects of the morphology and the evolution of pitting damage on the case hardened <b>sun</b> <b>gears...</b>|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: This {{planetary}} gear train consists of a <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> (yellow), planet gears (blue) supported by the carrier (green) and a ring gear (pink). The red marks show {{the relative displacement of}} the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> and carrier, when the carrier is rotated 45° clockwise and the ring gear is held fixed.|$|R
40|$|An {{iterative}} method {{has been developed}} for analyzing dynamic loads in a light weight basic planetary gear system. The effects of fixed, semi-floating, and fully-floating <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> conditions have been emphasized. The load dependent variable gear mesh stiffness were incorporated into a practical torsional dynamic model of a planetary gear system. The dynamic model consists of input and output units, shafts, and a planetary train. In this model, the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> has three degrees of freedom; two transverse and one rotational. The planets, ring gear, and the input and output units have one degree of freedom, (rotation) thus giving a total of nine degrees of freedoms for the basic system. The ring gear has a continuous radial support. The {{results indicate that the}} fixed <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> arrangement with accurate or errorless gearing offers in general better performance than the floating <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{experimental measurement}} of the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> orbit in dynamometer testing and describes its relation to the other measured responses of the planetary stage. The relation of the sun orbit to component runout, component flexibility, gear coupling alignment, planet load share, and planet position error will be investigated. Equations describing the orbit of the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> in the test cases are derived. Rigid and flexible multibody models of the full gearbox are investigated and compared to sun and planet measurements. This paper shows that the <b>sun</b> <b>gear's</b> path {{may be influenced by}} gear coupling responses and gearbox structural flexibilities...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: In this example, {{the carrier}} (green) is held {{stationary}} while the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> (yellow) {{is used as}} input. The planet gears (blue) turn in a ratio determined {{by the number of}} teeth in each gear. Here, the ratio is −24/16, or −3/2; each planet gear turns at 3/2 the rate of the <b>sun</b> <b>gear,</b> in the opposite direction.|$|R
50|$|The {{planetary}} gear housing features external gear teeth {{and can be}} rotated by a motor and worm gear. Alteration of the housing position allows rotation of the output <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> independently of the input <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> position. I.e. if the driver were to hold the steering wheel (and therefore the input <b>sun</b> <b>gear)</b> stationary, driving the {{planetary gear}} housing {{will result in the}} rotation of the steering pinion (and therefore a steering action at the front wheels). By manipulating the position of the planetary gear housing, the active steering ECU can synthesize a variable steering ratio or generate steering actions independently of the driver.|$|R
2500|$|In {{discussing}} the spur gear differential, {{the use of}} the term annular gear is a convenient way to distinguish the <b>sun</b> <b>gears</b> of the two epicyclic gear trains. [...] The second <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> serves the same purpose as the annular gear of a simple planetary gear train, but clearly does not have the internal gear mate that is typical of an annular gear.|$|R

50|$|Epicyclic gearing is also {{available}} which consists of a sun, a carrier, and two planets which mesh with each other. One planet meshes with the <b>sun</b> <b>gear,</b> while the second planet meshes with the ring gear. For this case, when the carrier is fixed, the ring gear rotates {{in the same direction}} as the <b>sun</b> <b>gear,</b> thus providing a reversal in direction compared to standard epicyclic gearing.|$|R

40|$|Two {{versions}} of the planetary reduction stages from U. S. Army OH- 58 helicopter main rotor transmissions were tested at NASA Lewis. One sequential and one nonsequential planetary were tested. <b>Sun</b> <b>gear</b> and ring gear teeth strains were measured, and stresses were calculated from the strains. The alternating stress at the fillet of both the loaded and unloaded sides of the teeth and {{at the root of}} the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> teeth are reported. Typical stress variations as the gear tooth moves through mesh are illustrated. At the tooth root location of the thin rimmed <b>sun</b> <b>gear,</b> a significant stress was produced by a phenomenon other than the passing of a planet gear. The load variation among the planets was studied. Each planet produced its own distinctive load distribution on the ring and <b>sun</b> <b>gears.</b> The load variation was less for a three planet, nonsequential design as compared to that of a four planet, sequential design. The reported results enhance the data base for gear stress levels and provide data for the validation of analytical methods...|$|R
40|$|Epicyclic gear {{transmissions}} which transmit output at a {{gear ratio}} dependent only upon the input's direction are considered. A transmission housing envelops two epicyclic gear assemblies, and has shafts extending from it. One shaft {{is attached to a}} <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> within the first epicyclic gear assembly. Planet gears are held symmetrically about the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> by a planet gear carrier and are in mesh with both the <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> and a ring gear. Two unidirectional clutches restrict rotation of the first planet gear carrier and ring gear to one direction. A connecting shaft drives a second <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> at the same speed and direction as the first planet gear carrier while a connecting portion drives a second planet gear carrier at the same speed and direction as the first ring gear. The transmission's output is then transmitted by the second ring gear to the second shaft. Input is transmitted at a higher gear ratio and lower speed for all inputs in the first direction than in the opposite direction...|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Sun</b> <b>gear</b> is {{operated}} from the hand-operated crank (connected to gear a1, driving the large four-spoked mean <b>sun</b> <b>gear,</b> b1) {{and in turn}} drives {{the rest of the}} <b>gear</b> sets. The <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> is b1/b2 and b2 has 64 teeth. It directly drives the date/mean sun pointer (there may have been a second, [...] "true sun" [...] pointer that displayed the sun's elliptical anomaly; it is discussed below in the Freeth reconstruction). In this discussion, reference is to modelled rotational period of various pointers and indicators; they all assume the input rotation of the b1 gear of 360 degrees, corresponding with one tropical year, and are computed {{solely on the basis of}} the gear ratios of the gears named.|$|R
5000|$|So, {{with the}} {{planetary}} carrier locked, one {{turn of the}} <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> results in [...] turns of the ring gear.|$|R
50|$|The Ravigneaux set has two <b>sun</b> <b>gears,</b> a large <b>sun</b> {{and a small}} sun, and {{a single}} planet carrier, holding two sets of {{planetary}} gears, inner planets and outer planets. The carrier is one sub-assembly but has two radii to couple with {{the inner and outer}} planets, respectively. The two sets of planet gears rotate independently of the carrier but co-rotate with a fixed gear ratio with respect to each other. The inner planets couple with the small <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> and co-rotate at a fixed gear ratio with respect to it. The outer planets couple with the large <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> and co-rotates with a fixed gear ratio with respect to it. Finally, the ring gear also couples and co-rotates with the outer planets in a fixed gear ratio with respect to them.|$|R
50|$|The {{planetary}} gear driving power through direct connection or link initiates the <b>sun</b> <b>gear.</b> The <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> then drives the {{planetary gear}}s assembled with the external gear ring to operate. The {{whole set of}} planetary gear system revolves on its own axis and along the external gear ring where the output shaft connected to the planetary carrier achieves the goal of speed reduction. A higher reduction ratio {{can be achieved by}} doubling the multiple staged gears and planetary gears.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the effect of}} gear geometrical errors in wind turbine planetary gearboxes with a floating <b>sun</b> <b>gear.</b> Numerical simulations and experiments are employed throughout the study. A National Renewable Energy Laboratory 750 kW gearbox is modelled in a multibody environment and verified using the experimental data obtained from a dynamometer test. The gear geometrical errors, which are both assembly dependent and assembly independent, are described, and planet-pin misalignment and eccentricity are selected as the two most influential and key errors for case studies. Various load cases involving errors in the floating and non-floating <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> designs are simulated, and the planet-bearing reactions, gear vibrations, gear mesh loads and bearing fatigue lives are compared. All tests and simulations are performed at the rated wind speed. For errorless <b>gears,</b> the non-floating <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> design performs better in terms of gear load variation, whereas the upwind planet bearing has more damage. In the floating <b>sun</b> <b>gear</b> scenario, the planet misalignment is neutralized by changing the sun motion pattern and the planet gear's elastic deformation. The effects of gear profile modifications are also evaluated, revealing that profile modifications such as crowning improve the effects of misalignment...|$|R

50|$|Torque {{multipliers}} typically employ an {{epicyclic gear}} train having {{one or more}} stages. Each stage of gearing multiplies the torque applied. In epicyclic gear systems, torque {{is applied to the}} input gear or ‘sun’ gear. A number of planet gears are arranged around and engaged with this <b>sun</b> <b>gear,</b> and therefore rotate. The outside casing of the multiplier is also engaged with the planet gear teeth, but is prevented from rotating by means of a reaction arm, causing the planet gears to orbit around the <b>sun</b> <b>gear.</b> The planet gears are held in a ‘planet carrier' which also holds the output drive shaft. As the planet gears orbit around the <b>sun</b> <b>gear,</b> the carrier and the output shaft rotate together. Without the reaction arm to prevent rotation of the outer casing, the output shaft cannot apply torque.|$|R
