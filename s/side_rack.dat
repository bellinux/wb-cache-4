50|$|The Jayhawk has a radar for search/weather {{that gives}} its nose a {{distinctive}} look. A forward looking infrared (FLIR) sensor turret can be mounted below its nose. It can carry three 120 gal fuel tanks with {{two on the}} port <b>side</b> <b>rack</b> {{and one on the}} starboard <b>side</b> <b>rack.</b> The starboard side also carries a 600 lbf kN capacity rescue hoist mounted above the door. The hoist has 200 ft of cable.|$|E
50|$|Houghton {{was added}} to the new {{acquisitions}} Aldridge, Peter Beardsley and John Barnes to form {{one of the most exciting}} forward lines in the club's history. He made his Reds debut on 24 October 1987 in the 1-0 league victory over Luton Town at Kenilworth Road. His first goal for the club came on 4 November 1987 in the 1-1 draw with Wimbledon at Plough Lane. Houghton's 62nd-minute strike came just 2 minutes after he had come on as a sub for Johnston. It also kept up Liverpool's remarkable start to the campaign which saw the <b>side</b> <b>rack</b> up 29 unbeaten league matches from the start of the season.|$|E
5000|$|John Blenkinsop {{thought that}} the {{friction}} would be too low of metal wheels on metal rails, so he built his locomotives for the Middleton Railway in 1812 with a 20 tooth, 3 ft diameter cog wheel (pinion) {{on the left side}} that engaged in rack teeth (two teeth per foot) on the outer side of the rail, the metal [...] "fishbelly" [...] edge rail with its <b>side</b> <b>rack</b> being cast all in one piece, in three feet (one yard) lengths. Blenkinsop's system remained in use for 25 years on the Middleton Railway, but it became a curiosity because simple friction was found to be sufficient for railroads operating on level ground.|$|E
50|$|Cargo trucks had a 14 ft long low sided {{box with}} a bottom hinged tailgate, bodies with drop sides were also standardized. Both had {{removable}} <b>side</b> <b>racks</b> with fold down troop seats and bows for a tarpaulin. Long cargo trucks, with an extra long wheelbase, had a 20 ft long box with <b>side</b> <b>racks</b> and bows for a tarpaulin. There were no drop side versions, and none had troop seats.|$|R
50|$|During the refurbishment, the {{carriages}} were {{fitted with}} air-conditioning. They were also given carpeting, first-class toilet facilities, Wi-Fi, LCD TVs, and <b>side</b> <b>racks</b> to store passenger luggage. Sri Lankan architectural firm KWA Architects prepared the interior designs.|$|R
50|$|The M813 was the {{standard}} cargo {{version of the}} series. It had a 14 ft long low sided box with a bottom hinged tailgate. <b>Side</b> <b>racks,</b> troop seats, and overhead bows with a tarpaulin were standard. A front-mounted winch was optional.|$|R
5000|$|Another form of rail, {{the edge}} rail, {{was first used}} by William Jessop on a line which was opened {{as part of the}} Charnwood Forest Canal between Loughborough and Nanpantan in Leicestershire in 1789. This line was {{originally}} designed as a plateway on the Outram system, but objections were raised to rails with upstanding ledges or flanges being laid on the turnpike road. This difficulty was overcome by paving or [...] "causewaying" [...] the road up {{to the level of the}} top of the flanges. In 1790, Jessop and his partner Outram began to manufacture edge-rails. Another example of the edge rail application was the Lake Lock Rail Road used primarily for coal transport. This was a public railway (charging a toll) and opened for traffic in 1798. The route started at Lake Lock, Stanley, on the Aire & Calder Navigation, near Wakefield, and ran to Outwood, a distance of approximately 3 mi. Edge-rails (with a <b>side</b> <b>rack)</b> were also used on the nearby Middleton-Leeds rack railway (a length of this rail is on display in Leeds City Museum).|$|E
50|$|The M924 (M926 w/winch) was the {{standard}} cargo {{version of the}} series. It had a 7 x 14 ft low sided box with a bottom hinged tailgate. <b>Side</b> <b>racks,</b> troop seats, and overhead bows with a canvas cover were standard.|$|R
50|$|The M54 was the {{standard}} cargo {{version of the}} series. It had a 7 ft × 14 ft low-sided box with a bottom-hinged tailgate. <b>Side</b> <b>racks,</b> troop seats, and overhead bows with a canvas cover were standard. A front-mounted winch was optional.|$|R
25|$|The E-30 {{could be}} armed, {{according}} to its training rôle. Possibilities included a fixed, forward firing 7.7mm (0.303in) Vickers machine gun or a similar gun in the rear cockpit. Up to six 12kg (23lb) bombs could be attached to under fuselage and fuselage <b>side</b> <b>racks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nicol {{began his}} career with Ayr United in 1979 and spent just over two seasons with the Scottish <b>side,</b> <b>racking</b> up 70 league appearances, before Liverpool manager Bob Paisley decided to pay {{what turned out to}} be a bargain price, £300,000, to bring Nicol to Anfield on 26 October 1981.|$|R
50|$|The EQ2080/2081 is the 2,500 kg class chassis for {{workshop}} shelters {{in service}} with the Air Force and Navy, intended for operations in mountainous areas and over rough roads and tracks.

25|$|The Panorama Elite II range {{built on}} the success of the Panorama I and Panorama Elite. The front grill was squared up {{although}} it still used the same twin headlight layout. The first bay on the near side was tidied up so the top of the window was in line with all the other <b>side</b> windows. Parcel <b>racks</b> were redesigned so the supply of fresh air and light output was more readily available. The service units were now mounted front to back instead of side to side and were much slimmer to maximize on headroom when leaving the seats. Crash padding was provided along the inner <b>side</b> of the <b>racks</b> in the form of black PVC squares filled with padding. The dashboard was again improved as was the front cabinet. The rear of the vehicle still used the soup plates from the previous range.|$|R

50|$|On 16 October, Wallace L. Lind began a pre-FRAM availability; and, {{one month}} later, she {{underwent}} Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) II conversion. This overhaul {{amounted to a}} complete renewal of her after superstructure, a new and modern combat information center, and modernization or complete overhaul of almost all machinery, weapons systems, and living accommodations. Changes to weapons systems involved adding to the previously-installed Hedgehog mounts two new <b>side</b> torpedo <b>racks</b> amidships for current inventory torpedoes. Immediately aft of the torpedo deck on the 01 level of the new superstructure, a hangar area and flight deck, from which the new Drone Antisubmarine Helicopter (DASH) could operate, was installed. Also installed was a variable depth sonar rig adding coverage for submarine search at various depth levels.|$|R
50|$|Due {{probably}} {{to the influence}} of nine-ball, in which the 1 ball must be the apex ball of the rack, most American bar players traditionally rack a game of eight-ball with the 1 ball in this position. Racking is also typically done solid-stripe-solid-stripe-solid along the two <b>sides</b> of the <b>rack,</b> resulting in solids being on all three corners. This is not a legal rack in World Standardized Rules, nor any other notable league ruleset other than APA.|$|R
50|$|An Equinox LTZ {{model was}} added. It is {{differentiated}} by its 17-inch chrome-clad aluminum wheels, bright chrome door handles and bright chrome luggage <b>rack</b> <b>side</b> rail inserts. Standard interior features include heated front seats, leather seating inserts, head curtain side impact air bags, AM/FM stereo with six-disc in-dash CD changer and MP3 CD playback capability, and a Pioneer premium seven-speaker audio system.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to assess the impacts of free water {{propagation}} in the Waste and Hygiene Compartment (WHC) installed in Node 3. Free water can be generated inside the WHC in small quantities due to crew hygiene activity. To mitigate potential impact of free water in Node 3 cabin the WHC doorway is enclosed by a waterproof bump-out, Kabin, with openings at the top and bottom. At the overhead <b>side</b> of the <b>rack,</b> there is a screen that prevents large drops of water from exiting. However, as the avionics fan in the WHC causes airflow toward the deck <b>side</b> of the <b>rack,</b> small quantities of free water may exit at the bottom of the Kabin. A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of Node 3 cabin airflow enable identifying the paths of water transport. To simulate the droplet transport the Lagrangian discrete phase approach was used. Various initial droplet distributions were considered in the study. The droplet diameter was varied in the range of 5 - 20 mm. The results of the computations showed that most of the drops fall to the rack surface not far from the WHC curtain...|$|R
50|$|The fencing of the Anichkov Bridge {{was created}} after the {{drawings}} of German architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel.
