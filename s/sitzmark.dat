40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the prevalence and type of idiopathic constipation by marker study. "nPatients and Methods: Thirty-six patients with idiopathic constipation were selected based on Rome 3 criteria. Patients had received a <b>Sitzmark</b> capsule made by Concyl Company which consists of 24 radioopaque markers orally. Then abdominal x-rays were performed after 72 and 120 hours. X-rays were reported by a radiologist. Patients were divided into different groups based on the colon transit time. It means that a few of the markers were seen in some radiographies and in the others the markers remained in the colon thoroughly or in the distal part of the colon. "nResults: In this study of the 36 patients, 11 patients were male (30. 5 %) and 25 (69. 5 %) were female. Their mean age was 30. 2 &plusmn;SD (from 9 to 57) years. Based on the obtained radiographies after 72 hours, 61. 1 % had a normal colon transit, 25 % had pelvic floor dysfunction, 19. 4 % had slow colon transit and 5. 6 % had combined disorder (i. e. slow colon transit and pelvic floor dysfunction). These data were 77. 8, 13. 9, 11. 1 and 2. 8 percent, respectively for normal transit pelvic floor dysfunction, slow transit and combined after 120 hours. "nConclusion: Most of the patients with idiopathic chronic constipation had normal colon transit. The other popular disorders in these patients were pelvic muscle dysfunction, slow colon transition and combined disorders, respectively. After normal colon transit, pelvic dysfunction was the second most common disorder in women and patients younger than 30 years old and slow colon transition was the most common disorder in men and patients older than 30 years old with idiopathic constipation.
