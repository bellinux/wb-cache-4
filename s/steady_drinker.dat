500|$|Tracy {{struggled}} with alcoholism throughout his adult life, an ailment {{that ran in}} his father's side of the family. Rather than being a <b>steady</b> <b>drinker,</b> as commonly thought, he was prone to periods of binging on alcohol. Loretta Young remarked that Tracy was [...] "awful" [...] when he was drunk, and he was twice arrested for his behavior while intoxicated. Because of this bad reaction to alcohol, Tracy regularly embarked on prolonged periods of sobriety, and developed an all-or-nothing routine. Hepburn commented that he could stop drinking for [...] "months, even years at a time".|$|E
60|$|Far {{worse than}} the controlled, <b>steady</b> <b>drinker</b> is the solitary drinker, {{and it was this}} that Daylight was {{developing}} into. He rarely drank sociably any more, but in his own room, by himself. Returning weary from each day's unremitting effort, he drugged himself to sleep, knowing that on the morrow he would rise up with a dry and burning mouth and repeat the program.|$|E
60|$|The big red motor-car was {{out more}} {{frequently}} now, while a stable hand {{was hired to}} give Bob exercise. In his early San Francisco days, there had been intervals of easement between his deals, but in this present biggest deal of all the strain was unremitting. Not in a month, or two, or three, could his huge land investment be carried to a successful consummation. And so complete and wide-reaching was it that complications and knotty situations constantly arose. Every day brought its problems, {{and when he had}} solved them in his masterful way, he left the office in his big car, almost sighing with relief at anticipation of the approaching double Martini. Rarely was he made tipsy. His constitution was too strong for that. Instead, he was that direst of all drinkers, the <b>steady</b> <b>drinker,</b> deliberate and controlled, who averaged a far higher quantity of alcohol than the irregular and violent drinker. For six weeks hard-running he had seen nothing of Dede except in the office, and there he resolutely refrained from making approaches. But by the seventh Sunday his hunger for her overmastered him. It was a stormy day.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} {{of a number of}} variables on the diets of 65 <b>steady</b> <b>drinkers</b> from alcohol rehabilitation units on Merseyside, United Kingdom was investigated. All drank principally beer or spirits. Social variables studied included age, sex, living alone or with others, employment status and socio-economic status. Alcohol-related variables included quantity consumed and preferred beverage. Dietary outcome was assessed in terms of the variety of foods and the number of meals eaten per week. Living alone proved by far the most important determinant of reduced diet. Spirit drinkers ate more meals than beer drinkers, but only if living with others. Increased alcohol consumption related modestly to fewer foods and meals being consumed. Drinkers living alone constitute a much larger proportion of those entering rehabilitation programmes in Queensland, Australia than in the United Kingdom. The present findings may help to explain the high incidence in Queensland of thiamin deficiency syndromes including the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome...|$|R
6000|$|The latter {{shook his}} head. 'I {{think he is}} going {{downhill}} fast. He will talk. We have tried opiates as strong as we dare give him, but they don't {{seem to have any}} effect, which is often the case with <b>steady</b> <b>drinkers.</b> He has not been a drunkard, I believe, but he has been in the habit of taking a lot of liquor regularly. He scarcely sleeps at all. That girl nurses him with wonderful patience, but she is breaking down under the strain. She wasn't in his tent this morning, and {{it is the first time}} that she has been away. When I called the other man, Murdoch, seemed a good deal put out. I don't know what about, and when I told him outside the tent that the other was worrying himself and was a good deal weaker than he was two days ago, he muttered, [...] "The infernal skunk, it is a pity he didn't go down twenty years ago." [...] So I suppose there has been some row between them.' ...|$|R
60|$|So short {{a period}} of sleep then intervened before early morning rising that my system {{did not have time}} to work off the alcohol. As a result I awoke with mouth parched and dry, with a slight {{heaviness}} of head, and with a mild nervous palpitation in the stomach. In fact I did not feel good. I was suffering from the morning sickness of the <b>steady,</b> heavy <b>drinker.</b> What I needed was a pick-me-up, a bracer. Trust John Barleycorn, once he has broken down a man's defences! So it was a drink before breakfast to put me right for breakfast--the old poison of the snake that has bitten one! Another custom begun at this time was that of the pitcher of water by the bedside to furnish relief to my scorched and sizzling membranes.|$|R
