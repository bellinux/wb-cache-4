50|$|<b>Sal</b> <b>fat</b> is {{extracted}} via three methods. Traditionally fat {{is extracted}} by water rendering. The second, mechanical system is extraction by oil expeller and rotary mills. The third method is via solvent extraction {{in which the}} seed is pressed as flakes first in a flaker mill and exposed to solvent extraction.|$|E
50|$|The {{extracted}} crude sal oil/fat is greenish-brown and has {{a characteristic}} odour. Due {{to the presence of}} more saturated fatty acids, it is solid at room temperature. Because of this, it is known as <b>sal</b> <b>fat</b> or sal butter. The oil is used as cooking oil after refining. The oil contains 35-45% stearic acid, an 18-carbon saturated fatty acid, and 40-45% oleic acid, which is a mono unsaturated fatty acid, with 18 carbon atoms. The refined oil is used as substitute for cocoa butter in chocolate manufacturing.|$|E
40|$|The work {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on the compositional data of vegetable fats used or proposed as alternatives to cocoa butte in chocolate and confectionary products. These fats are mostly mixtures of various vegetable fats often modified) and can consist of palm and palm kernel oil, illipe fat, shea butter, <b>sal</b> <b>fat</b> and kokum butter. In addition, a large variety of other vegetable oils can be used. Their composition according to triglycerides, fatty acids, sterols and other unsaponifiable components is discussed. Moreover we review {{the literature on}} analytical methods suitable for the detection and identification and determination of foreign fats in cocoa butter and chocolate. None of the methods reviewed here, allows the unequivocal quantification or just detection of foreign fats in chocolate. It is proposed to combine a number of techniques with a chemometric approach to develop unique patterns allowing the unequivocal detection and quantification foreign fats without having prior knowledge regarding the kind of fat added.

5000|$|Currently, {{there are}} only three Ranger Girls still {{involved}} in crime fighting. The fourth Ranger Girl, Georgette Chebleu, was tortured and mutilated by Mafia turkey doctor <b>Fat</b> <b>Sal,</b> prompting Bolan to give her a mercy bullet. The Executioner would later avenge her.|$|R
40|$|Dammar {{is one of}} Indonesian {{forestry}} products which is abundant. It has unique physical, chemical and functional properties. The important physical properties of dammar include its solubility in some organic solvents, softening temperature, viscosity and its absorbance. The important chemical properties reviewed here include its properties as resin, composition of terpenoid compounds present in dammar, and essential oil yielded from distillation of fresh dammar. Physical and chemical properties of dammar need to be studied further in order to optimize its functional properties. So far, dammar is widely used as weighting agent and source of essential oil. However, now, some species of dammar are being explored and developed for <b>sal</b> flour, <b>fat</b> source, triacylglycerol substituent for cocoa butter and wood preservatives...|$|R
40|$|Power-Assisted lipoplasty (PAL) is a {{new method}} {{introduced}} to simplify and standardize surgical results of traditional suction-assisted lipoplasty (SAL). Comparative studies already have demonstrated PAL to be a handy, atraumatic, time- and fatigue-sparing technique. The authors performed a pilot study to compare the output capacity of PAL and SAL in 15 healthy female patients. The general and the specific per area outputs over 1 min from symmetrical areas were assessed. The results confirmed the efficiency of PAL (17. 41 % increase in average specific area output, as compared to SAL) {{and the distribution of}} fat in major "fat storage" areas such as the abdomen and the anterior thigh. Specific per area output indicated a higher suction capacity for PAL in all areas except the inner thigh. The efficiency of PAL seemed to be less influenced than that <b>SAL</b> by <b>fat</b> distribution...|$|R
50|$|The only Ranger Girl to {{be killed}} in action during a tour of duty with the Justice Department. A French-Canadian, Chebleu became acquainted with Mack Bolan during his Las Vegas mission. During another Bolan mission in Detroit, Michigan, she was {{captured}} by Mafia soldiers and brought to <b>Fat</b> <b>Sal,</b> the Mafia turkey doctor. She was severely tortured and mutilated before Bolan came to rescue her. Unwilling to let her continue to suffer, Bolan shot her at point-blank range through the head. He avenged her by killing those involved. Chebleu would, therefore, not {{have a chance to}} become part of Stony Man.|$|R
