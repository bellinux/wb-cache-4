2500|$|Atwater: You {{start out}} in 1954 by saying, [...] "Nigger, nigger, nigger". By 1968 you can't say [...] "nigger"—that hurts you. Backfires. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> stuff like forced busing, states' rights {{and all that}} stuff. You're getting so {{abstract}} now [...] you're talking about cutting taxes, {{and all these things}} you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [...] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me—because obviously sitting around saying, [...] "We want to cut this", is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and {{a hell of a lot}} more abstract than [...] "Nigger, nigger".|$|E
6000|$|... "We've been at Hintock {{as long as}} they've been at Buckbury; is it not <b>so?</b> <b>You</b> <b>say</b> {{our name}} occurs in old deeds continually." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ay, ay, that's the {{way with}} fine ladies,--they like to be condescending and affable. And <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> they receive you well? make {{you one of the}} family--eh?' ...|$|E
60|$|DORA. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> always <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> old dears. But {{you know}} better. Bobby came to me: I didnt come to him.|$|R
50|$|<b>So</b> <b>you</b> could <b>say</b> that hankido means: The way for Korean {{people to}} develop their {{internal}} energy/strength.|$|R
30|$|Facilitator: Ah, okay, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> are <b>saying</b> that {{students}} can {{just sit back and}} then not do anything—ah, she could—.|$|R
6000|$|Gent. Well, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> he had fire, {{but gave}} no light, {{it was a}} devilish fire indeed; did it feel warm? was the room hot {{while he was in}} it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... (c.) [...] "The third mode is, to add by three, in {{the same}} way. You {{recollect}} that eight consists of two threes and a two; <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> seven;--eight, nine, ten;--eleven, twelve, thirteen;--fourteen, fifteen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{they say}} lies," [...] said Nina, her eyes {{flashing}} fire upon her Christian lover through {{the gloom of}} the evening. [...] "Who says <b>so?</b> <b>You</b> <b>say</b> so. No one else would be mean enough to be so false." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, true; <b>so</b> <b>you</b> were <b>saying.</b> I forgot. Well, {{will you}} take a glass of wine?"--and Barry filled his own glass quite full.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon me--I {{mean nothing}} against your ladyship's honour or character, which, no doubt, are quite safe. Harry <b>says</b> <b>so,</b> and <b>you</b> <b>say</b> so--what more can one ask?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Interviewer: <b>So</b> <b>you</b> are not <b>saying</b> {{intelligence}} {{is a single}} number? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Most insensible youth!" [...] O'Sullivan said, with a laugh; [...] "insensible and {{discreet}} {{to a point}} that, were it not assured, none {{would believe}} that you had Irish blood in your veins. And <b>so,</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> you are going over to Versailles tomorrow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You know me, Metzar," [...] Colonel Zane said grimly. [...] "I don't waste words. 'To {{hell with}} law!' <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>say.</b> I can say that, too. Remember, the next drunken boy I see, or shady deal, or {{gambling}} spree, out {{you go for}} good." ...|$|E
60|$|AMERICAN. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>say.</b> But I judge your form of chivalry is {{sacrifice}} to the state. We allow {{more freedom to}} the individual soul. Where there's something little and weak, we feel it kind of noble to give up to it. That way we feel elevated.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush," [...] she said, [...] "here comes my father" [...] (the Squire {{had been}} {{counting}} the game); [...] "he hates bets, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> mustn't <b>say</b> anything about our match." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good heavens!' cried his wife. 'How did {{the hare}} {{get into your}} net? It IS a hare, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> needn't <b>say</b> it isn't. After all, people must have said the truth----' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mary, then I'll {{tell you}} exactly how it is--but mind, I don't want it talked about yet for rasons; <b>so</b> <b>you</b> won't <b>say</b> {{anything}} about it if I tell you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{would you}} have me say? If I told you that he was dying for love, you would say, I was trying to cheat you; and now because I don't tell you <b>so,</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that he is wanting in devotion. I must say you are hard to please." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (a.) Counting by your fingers. ("Yes sir.") You {{take the}} first figure,--suppose it is seven, and the one above it, eight. Now you {{recollect}} that to add eight, you must count all the fingers of one hand, and all but two again. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> seven--eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't know him, Squire," [...] the constable said as {{they stopped}} before his house and told him what had happened. [...] "However, he {{certainly}} is dead, and I will {{get one of the}} men to help me carry him into the shed behind the courthouse. <b>So</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that you think that the other is wounded?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{expected}} you'd do that. All sceptics do, I believe. But I want to {{know all}} that took place. You're <b>so</b> concise. <b>You</b> <b>say</b> the cone emitted a man's voice. Now, how could--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, 'tis real enough,' said Loveday, {{looking at}} the river with {{balanced}} sentiments; 'and <b>so</b> <b>you</b> will <b>say</b> when you've lived here a bit as mis'ess, and had the trouble of claning the furniture.' ...|$|R
60|$|FAITH. Well, my brother, I am {{bound to}} believe you, {{not only because}} <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> know him, but also because like a Christian you make your reports of men. For I cannot think you speak these things of ill-will, {{but because it is}} even <b>so</b> as <b>you</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Newspapers, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> don't always treat [...] The Judges with respect. That {{may be so}} And {{still no}} harm done, for I swear I'll eat [...] My legs {{and in the long}} {{hereafter}} go, [...] Snake-like, upon my belly if you'll show All Judges are respectable and sweet. For some of them are rogues and the world's laughter's Directed at some others, for they're Shafters.|$|E
6000|$|... 'As {{for your}} world {{of art and}} your world of reality,' she replied, 'you have to {{separate}} the two, because you can't bear {{to know what you}} are. You can't bear to realise what a stock, stiff, hide-bound brutality you ARE really, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> [...] "it's the world of art." [...] The world of art is only the truth about the real world, that's all--but you are too far gone to see it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You tell me {{more than}} his judges {{were able to get}} out of him. He was judged by a {{commission}} of three. He would tell them absolutely nothing. I have the report of the interrogatories here, by me. After every question there stands 'Refuses to answer--refuses to answer.' It's like that page after page. You see, I have been entrusted with some further investigations around and about this affair. He has left me nothing to begin my investigations on. A hardened miscreant. And <b>so,</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> he believed in...." ...|$|E
3000|$|I {{think the}} {{severity}} of a natural disaster is downgraded when <b>you</b> <b>say</b> it in English to older people. <b>So,</b> if <b>you</b> <b>say</b> a warning in Tongan that a disaster could happen, people will be like “oh my gosh, this is so serious.” (Tongan, female) [...]...|$|R
60|$|FAITH. Well, my brother, I am {{bound to}} believe you; {{not only because}} <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> know him, but also because, like a Christian, you make your reports of men. For I cannot think that you speak these things of ill-will, {{but because it is}} even <b>so</b> as <b>you</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{said about}} ten," [...] Tony repeats. [...] "Yes, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> did <b>say</b> about ten. But {{according}} to my count, it's ten times ten--it's a hundred o'clock. I never had such a night in my life!" ...|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} you feel {{completely}} crushed. You bury your face in your hands and think {{you would like to}} die and go to heaven. You picture to yourself your own sick-bed, with all your friends and relations standing round you weeping. You bless them all, especially the young and pretty ones. They will value you when you are gone, <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> to yourself, and learn too late what they have lost; and you bitterly contrast their presumed regard for you then with their decided want of veneration now.|$|E
6000|$|... "What a blunderhead I am!" [...] cries the Colonel, {{with delight}} on his countenance, {{spite of his}} professed repentance. [...] "It never once entered my head that the youngster would take any part in the affair. I showed him his cousin's letter casually, just to amuse him, I think, for he has been deuced low lately, about--about a young man's scrape that he has got into. And he must have gone off and {{despatched}} his challenge straightway. I recollect he appeared uncommonly brisk at breakfast the next morning. And <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> General, the Baronet {{did not like the}} poulet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Welsh {{are ever}} {{a thorn in}} our side," [...] the prior said, [...] "and {{treaties}} with them are useless. I trust that Harold will succeed in thoroughly reducing them to obedience, for whenever there is trouble in the kingdom they take advantage of it, and are ready to form alliances with any ambitious earl who hoists the standard of revolt. And <b>so</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> Harold has already made you full thane? I am well pleased to hear it, {{if for no other}} reason than that it is good for people when they are ruled over by their own lord and not by a stranger; though I say nothing against Egbert, Harold's steward. Still no man can rule like the master himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She is a {{different}} sort of woman, Faith, and <b>so</b> <b>you</b> would <b>say</b> if <b>you</b> knew her. Of course, it is natural for you to criticize her severely just now, and I don't wish to defend her.' ...|$|R
60|$|ATTEN. It must needs be <b>so</b> as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> {{if these}} things {{be true that}} you have {{asserted}} of him. And I do the rather believe them, because I think you dare not tell a lie of the dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "If you {{are bent}} upon going, {{by all means}} do <b>so.</b> As <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> a {{tourniquet}} clapped on directly a man is wounded may save his life, and every additional musket will be a valuable addition to our strength." ...|$|R
