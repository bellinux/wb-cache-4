50|$|A <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> is a {{metal plate}} affixed to a doorjamb {{with a hole}} or holes for the bolt of the door. When the door is closed, the bolt extends into {{the hole in the}} <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> and holds the door closed. The <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> protects the jamb against {{friction}} from the bolt and increases security {{in the case of a}} jamb made of a softer material (such as wood) than the <b>strike</b> <b>plate.</b> A plate on the lockset itself (on the door, not the jamb) is instead called a face plate.|$|R

50|$|Hammermills are impact {{grinders}} with swinging or stationary steel bars forcing ingredients {{against a}} circular screen or solid serrated section {{designated as a}} <b>striking</b> <b>plate.</b> Material is held in the grinding chamber until it is reduced {{to the size of}} the openings in the screen. The number of hammers on a rotating shaft, their size, arrangement, sharpness, the speed of rotation, wear patterns, and clearance at the tip relative to the screen or <b>striking</b> <b>plate</b> are important variables in grinding capacity and the appearance of ground feed.|$|R
5000|$|Deadlocking {{latchbolt}} (deadlatch) is an elaboration on the latchbolt {{which includes}} a guardbolt to prevent “shimming” or “jimmying” of the latch bolt. When the door is closed, the latchbolt and guardbolt are retracted together, and the door closes normally, with the latchbolt entering the <b>strike</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>strike</b> <b>plate,</b> however, holds the guardbolt in its depressed position: a mechanism within the lockset holds the latchbolt in the projected position. This arrangement prevents the latchbolt from being depressed {{through the use of}} a credit card or some other tool, which would lead to unauthorized entry.|$|R
50|$|A single-throw bolt. The bolt can {{be engaged}} in its <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> only after the door is closed. The locking {{mechanism}} typically prevents the bolt from being retracted by force.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>strike</b> <b>plates</b> {{have their}} hole size and {{placement}} calculated so a spring-bolt extends into the hole, but an adjacent anti-retraction device remains depressed, preventing the bolt from being retracted unless the lock is turned.|$|R

40|$|Bird strikes are {{a common}} problem for the {{aerospace}} industry and can cause serious damage to an aircraft. Ballistic gelatin is frequently used as a surrogate for actual bird carcasses in bird strike tests. Numerical simulations of these tests are used to supplement experimental data, therefore {{it is necessary to}} use numerical modeling techniques that can accurately capture the dynamic response of ballistic gelatin. An experimental technique is introduced to validate these modeling techniques. A ballistic gelatin projectile is fired into a <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> attached to a 36 in. long sensor tube. Dynamic load is measured at two locations relative to the <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> using strain gages configured in a full Wheatstone bridge. Data from these experiments are used to validate a gelatin constitutive model. Simulations of the apparatus are analyzed to investigate its performance...|$|R

40|$|An {{electromagnetic}} attachment {{mechanism for}} use as an end effector of a remote manipulator system. A pair of electromagnets 15 A, 15 B, each with a U-shaped magnetic core with a pull-in coil 34 and two holding coils 35, 36 are mounted by a spring suspension system 38, 47 on a base plate 25 of the mechanism housing 30 with end pole pieces 21, 22 adapted to move through openings in the base plate when the attractive force of the electromagnets is exerted on a <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> 65 of a grapple fixture 20 affixed to a target object 14. The pole pieces are spaced by an air gap from the <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> when the mechanism first contacts the grapple fixture. An individual control circuit and power source is provided for the pull-in coil and one holding coil of each electromagnet. A back-up control circuit connected to the two power sources and a third power source is provided for the remaining holding coils. When energized, the pull-in coils overcome the suspension system and air gap and are automatically de-energized when the pole pieces move to grapple and impose a preload force across the grapple interface. A battery back-up 89 A, 89 B is a redundant power source for each electromagnet in each individual control circuit and is automatically connected upon failure of the primary power source. A centerline mounted camera 31 and video monitor 70 are used in cooperation with a target pattern 19 on the reflective surface 67 of the <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> to effect targeting and alignment...|$|R
40|$|In a magnetically {{diverted}} tokamak, the scrape-off layer (SOL) and divertor plasma provides {{separation between}} the first wall and the core plasma, intercepting impurities generated at the wall {{before they reach the}} core plasma. The divertor plasma can also serve to spread the heat and particle flux over a large area of divertor structure wall using impurity radiation and neutral charge exchange, thus reducing peak heat and particle fluxes at the divertor <b>strike</b> <b>plate.</b> Such a reduction will be required in the next generation of tokamaks, for without it, the divertor engineering requirements are very demanding. To successfully demonstrate a radiative divertor, a highly radiative condition with significant volume recombination must be achieved in the divertor, while maintaining a low impurity content in the core plasma. Divertor plasma properties are determined by a complex interaction of classical parallel transport, anomalous perpendicular transport, impurity transport and radiation, and plasma wall interaction. In this paper the authors describe a set of experiments on DIII-D designed to provide detailed two dimensional documentation of the divertor and SOL plasma. Measurements have been made in operating modes where the plasma is attached to the divertor <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> and in highly radiating cases where the plasma is detached from the divertor <b>strike</b> <b>plate.</b> They also discuss the results of experiments designed to influence the distribution of impurities in the plasma using enhanced SOL plasma flow. Extensive modeling efforts will be described which are successfully reproducing attached plasma conditions and are helping to elucidate the important plasma and atomic physics involved in the detachment process...|$|R

5000|$|Latchbolt or Latch bolt An {{extremely}} common latch type, typically {{part of a}} lockset, it is a spring-loaded bolt with an angled edge. When {{the door}} is pushed closed, the angled edge of the latchbolt engages with {{the lip of the}} strike plate; a spring allows the bolt to retract. Once the door is fully closed, the bolt automatically extends into the <b>strike</b> <b>plate,</b> holding the door closed. The latchbolt is disengaged (retracted) typically when the user turns the door handle, which via the lockset's mechanism, manually retracts the latchbolt, allowing the door to open.|$|R
50|$|The parts {{included}} in the typical US mortise lock installation are the lock body (the part installed inside the mortise cut-out in the door); the lock trim (which may be selected from any number of designs of doorknobs, levers, handle sets and pulls); a <b>strike</b> <b>plate,</b> or a box keep, which lines {{the hole in the}} frame into which the bolt fits; and the keyed cylinder which operates the locking/unlocking function of the lock body. However, in the United Kingdom, and most other countries, mortise locks on dwellings do not use cylinders, but have lever mechanisms.|$|R
50|$|A lockset (alternatively lock set) is the {{hardware}} and components {{that make up}} the locking or latching mechanism that can usually be found on a door or other hinged object but can also include sliding doors and dividers.The components of a lockset can include (but are not limited to) the door handles (commonly both inside and outside), latchbolt, dead bolt, face <b>plate,</b> <b>strike</b> <b>plate,</b> escutcheon, thumbturn, push button, turn button, and other trim. The lockset and associated hardware typically defines a door's function and how a user could (or could not) access the two adjacent spaces defined by the opening associated with the lockset.|$|R
25|$|At the Lavachicha site (municipality of Castrejón, Valladolid) {{several pieces}} of typical Roman pottery named terra sigillata hispanica have been {{unearthed}} {{and there was}} also an archaeological excavation in the 1980s that revealed a necropolis from late Roman times or, perhaps, from Visigothic times. Similar remains of late Roman pottery, have been found in Carpio (Valladolid), but only at ground level, and not from archaeological excavation. Another municipality crossed by the Trabancos River is Nava del Rey (a small town located in Valladolid), where, once again, are found superficial pieces of terra sigillata hispanica and a <b>striking</b> <b>plate</b> fragment with red gloss, resembling those that were carried by Roman legionaries on military campaigns.|$|R

30|$|Muscle {{activity}} was recorded using surface electromyography (K 800, Biometrics, Newport, UK) for the rectus femoris (RF), vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL), semitendinosus (ST), biceps femoris (BF), tibialis anterior (TA), peroneus longus (PL), and the lateral {{head of the}} gastrocnemius (GL). Electromyography amplifiers (SX 230 - 1000, Biometrics; inter-electrode distance 2  cm), which function as combined surface electrodes and amplifiers, were placed parallel to {{the direction of the}} muscle fibres; a grounding electrode was placed on the left wrist. Induced myogenic potential was converted to a digital display (sampling rate, 1000  Hz) and saved on a personal computer using the TRIAS data importing and analysis system (Biometrics). Raw electromyography signals were converted to root mean square values and used to compare strike forms.

40|$|In {{the near}} future the {{interior}} materials of JET will be changed to a beryllium wall and tungsten divertor so as to resemble the ITER design. Initially {{there will be no}} carbon <b>strike</b> <b>plates</b> in the divertor but there is the possibility of adding these later for an exact match. Such a change requires upgraded spectroscopic diagnostics in order to measure the spatially dependent influx of these impurities and their concentrations in the confined plasma. With 74 ionization stages (many of them very complex) the high Z of tungsten also places new demands on the atomic physics required to model its behavior which in turn informs the design of potential diagnostic systems. Modeled emission patterns from the upgraded JET are used as part of the diagnostic specification.

40|$|Future fusion reactors, like ITER, {{will rely}} on an active exhaust system to pump tritium (T) in the {{divertor}} and then recirculate it to the fuel stream. Estimation of the T inventory requires a detailed T balance, which determines if T is preferentially enriched relative to D in its pathway from the main plasma to the divertor and pump. On the Joint European Torus (JET), the neutral T concentration in the sub-divertor (pumping plenum and region below the divertor <b>strike</b> point <b>plate)</b> is measured with a modified Penning gauge coupled to a high-resolution spectrometer. In addition, T concentration measurements {{are made in the}} plasma edge and strike point region with a spectrometer viewing these regions. The sub-divertor and divertor (region above the <b>strike</b> point <b>plate)</b> T concentration measurements show differences during initial T uptake and retention which are characteristic of wall deposition properties.

40|$|For the ITER-like wall, the JET mirror link {{divertor}} spectroscopy {{system was}} redesigned to fully cover the tungsten horizontal <b>strike</b> <b>plate</b> with faster time resolution and improved near-UV performance. Since the ITER-like wall project involves {{a change in}} JET from a carbon dominated machine to a beryllium and tungsten dominated machine with residual carbon, {{the aim of the}} system is to provide the recycling flux, equivalent, to the impinging deuterium ion flux, the impurity fluxes (C, Be, O) and tungsten sputtering fluxes and hence give information on the tungsten divertor source. In order to do this self-consistently, the system also needs to provide plasma characterization through the deuterium Balmer spectra measurements of electron density and temperature during high density. L-Mode results at the density limit from Stark broadening/line ratio analysis will be presented and compared to Langmuir probe profiles and 2 D-tomography of low-n Balmer emission [1].

40|$|The {{one-dimensional}} Frenkel-Kontorova (FK) model, {{well known}} from the theory of dislocations in crystal materials, {{is applied to the}} simulation of the process of nonelastic stress propagation along transform faults. Dynamic parameters of plate boundary earthquakes as well as slow earthquakes and afterslip are quantitatively described, including propagation velocity along the <b>strike,</b> <b>plate</b> boundary velocity during and after the strike, stress drop, displacement, extent of the rupture zone, and spatiotemporal distribution of stress and strain. The three fundamental speeds of plate movement, earthquake migration, and seismic waves are shown to be connected in framework of the continuum FK model. The magnitude of the strain wave velocity is a strong (almost exponential) function of accumulated stress or strain. It changes from a few km/s during earthquakes to a few dozen km per day, month, or year during afterslip and interearthquake periods. Results of the earthquake parameter calculation based on real data are in reasonable agreement with measured values.
