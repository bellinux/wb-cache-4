25|$|In 1943, when Jones was ten, {{his family}} moved to Bremerton, Washington, where his father got a wartime job at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. After the war, the Jones family moved to Seattle, the major {{regional}} city, where Jones attended Garfield High School near his home. He had discovered music when he was 12 and became more deeply involved in high school, developing his skills as a trumpeter and arranger. His classmates there included Charles Taylor, who played saxophone and whose mother, Evelyn Bundy, had been one of Seattle's first society jazz-band leaders. The youths began playing with a band. At the age of 14, they were playing with a National Reserve band. Jones has <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> much more experience with music growing up in a smaller city; otherwise, he would have faced too much competition.|$|E
25|$|His {{major new}} journalism, or {{creative}} nonfiction books, also include Miami and the Siege of Chicago (1968), {{an account of}} the 1968 political conventions; Of a Fire on the Moon (1971), a long report on the Apollo 11 mission to the moon; The Prisoner of Sex (1971), his response to Kate Millett’s critique of the patriarchal myths in the works of Mailer, Jean Genet, Henry Miller, and D.H. Lawrence; and The Fight (1975), an account of Muhammad Ali’s 1974 defeat in Zaire of George Foreman for the heavyweight boxing championship. Miami, Fire, and Prisoner were all finalists for the National Book Award. The hallmark of his five New Journalism works in his use of illeism, or referring to oneself in the third person, rather than the first. Mailer <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the idea from reading The Education of Henry Adams (1918) when he was a Harvard freshman. Mailer also employs many of the most common techniques of fiction in his creative nonfiction.|$|E

500|$|Obama later <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> [...] "my {{rear end}} handed to me" [...] in his loss to Rush and {{acknowledged}} his own hubris. However, many {{analysts believe that}} Obama's loss helped him to learn from his mistakes, which enabled him to run more successful campaigns in 2004 and 2008. [...] Obama {{was seen as a}} stiff policy wonk, and he used the experience to hone his ability to connect with voters. [...] According to Chicago City Council member Toni Preckwinkle, an early Obama supporter, Obama [...] "took a hard look at himself after that campaign and became a much better campaigner, more at ease on the campaign trail." [...] He put more effort into his campaign, hiring David Axelrod as his chief political strategist. Also, Obama increased his focus on the Illinois Senate, improving his legislative accomplishments.|$|E
500|$|... "Sister City" [...] {{was written}} by Alan Yang and {{directed}} by series co-creator Michael Schur. The episode featured comedian Fred Armisen in a guest appearance as Raul, the vice director of a Venezuelan parks department. Armisen was a cast member of NBC's sketch comedy show Saturday Night Live, where he previously worked with performer Poehler and writer Schur. Armisen has played Venezuelan characters before, and previously imitated President of Venezuela Hugo Chavez on Saturday Night Live. Armisen <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> into character by thinking about his uncle, who is from Venezuela. But {{he said it was}} not a difficult performance because [...] "most of the joke is the uniform", which included a tan military-style jacket with medals, a red beret and a sash with the colors of the Venezuela flag. The uniform also included a fictional seal designed by Schur, which included an image of Chavez, machine guns, an oil tower, a lion and a parrot.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of the {{scheduled}} flight, the day before the concert, on 12 September, Lennon, Ono, and Clapton were not at the airport. At this point, Clapton had not been aware of the concert, nor of Lennon contacting him. Brower had managed to get through to Clapton and told him to contact Lennon and Ono, who were still in bed. Clapton <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> [...] "a phone call on the day we were to leave and he said that someone had asked him to do that concert and it was that night! So I had to make the airport in an hour." [...] The group had two rehearsals: one was during the transatlantic flight from London to Toronto, and the other shortly before appearing on stage at the actual festival. Lennon said the group [...] "didn't know what to play", as they had not previously performed together. Also on the flight, Lennon gained the confidence, that when he got back to England, to leave the Beatles. Lennon told this to Clapton, and shortly afterwards, to the Beatles' then-manager, Allen Klein.|$|E

2500|$|The Titans {{special teams}} {{coach at the}} time, Alan Lowry, <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the {{inspiration}} for the play from another game in 1982 between Texas Tech and SMU.

2500|$|Tales {{about the}} origin of Robinson's {{nickname}} even varied across the color line, a consequence of differing opinions of him by blacks and whites. To whites, for example, his nickname [...] "Bojangles" [...] meant happy-go-lucky, while the black variety artist Tom Fletcher claimed it was slang for [...] "squabbler." [...] Robinson himself <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the nickname as a child in Richmond. This is the most commonly accepted version.|$|E

We cultivate cooperation with police and work within the law to get justice, not outside of the law." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the success}} of The Johnstown Flood, two new {{publishers}} offered him contracts, one {{to write about the}} Great Chicago Fire and another about the San Francisco earthquake. Simon & Schuster, publisher of his first book, also offered McCullough a contract to write a second book. Trying not to become [...] "Bad News McCullough", he decided to write about a subject showing [...] "people were not always foolish and inept or irresponsible." [...] He remembered the words of his Yale teacher: [...] " [...] Wilder <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the idea for a book or a play when he wanted to learn about something. Then, he'd check to see if anybody had already done it, and if they hadn't, he'd do it." [...] McCullough decided to write a history of the Brooklyn Bridge, which he had walked across many times.|$|E
2500|$|Robinson {{had told}} Billboard {{that he had}} been {{lobbying}} for the Miracles since his own induction, [...] "making calls and signing petitions and everything, because they really deserve it." [...] Though some felt Robinson should've been included as an inductee with the other Miracles, Robinson said, [...] "I don't really even care about that. I'm already in there. I don't understand why it was, like, a task to get the Miracles in there. We were one of the hottest and most prolific groups in the world at that time, so I don't understand the hesitancy." [...] Claudette Robinson stated, [...] "When I spoke to (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame & Museum President and CEO) Terry Stewart, he <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> no less than 900 e-mails per day saying the Miracles should be inducted, and why aren't they? I was surprised by that. I would think five or 10, but he said that amount, so it's {{a lot of people that}} were really pulling for us. You have to be thankful and grateful for that." [...] However, before this decision, Miracle Marv Tarplin died in September 2011 at the age of 70, just months before the induction ceremony.|$|E

He explains, [...] "Gaming was about 50% of my life , mainly PC gaming but I grew up with all the consoles... Working on the show has really opened up more genres to me that I never got into as much." [...] He described the progression from unemployed actor to host of an award winning show in 2 years as [...] "rewarding, fantastic, exciting and relieving." [...] Bajo's first gaming memory was of Ms. Pac-Man. When explaining to other what he does for a living, Bajo feels the need to defend it, explaining that [...] "it's actually really hard work".|$|E

While at the Veterans Day parade, Peter hears Herbert sing [...] "God Bless The USA" [...] by Lee Greenwood. When at the bar, Peter <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> a tattoo of the Space Shuttle on his penis and Quagmire in his head {{said he was going}} to do it and plays [...] "I Love a Rainy Night" [...] by Eddie Rabbitt. When Peter acts like a super U.S. Patriot he terminates anything associated with illegal immigration, such as arresting Brian's 85-year-old Korean Buddhist accupuncturist and discarding Stewie's Speedy Gonzales video. During the scene in which Peter and Brian are talking about immigrants, Peter says that [...] "they are part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take 'em away!" [...] This is a reference to a line spoken by Darth Vader to Princess Leia in the movie Star Wars. The party Peter is invited to is the celebration of Cinco de Mayo. The scene in which Peter is hired as a babysitter of two children is a reference to the film Mary Poppins. When taking the immigration test, Peter is asked who founded America to which he replies [...] "Dick York" [...] but then quickly changes his answer to [...] "Dick Sargent". This is a reference to the two actors who played Darrin Stephens on the 1960s television show Bewitched. [...] Quagmire considers getting a tattoo in the shape of the Space Needle. John McCain is referenced. The ending to the film Dirty Dancing is referenced. While Peter is seen sacrificing a goat in the name of Toby Keith, it is seen gone and a hat slowly disappearing into the brush, is reference to Jurassic Park with the Tyrannosaurus eating the goat.
