50|$|Cleomella {{is a small}} genus {{of about}} ten species of {{flowering}} plants. Like their relatives, the cleomes, plants of this genus have traditionally {{been included in the}} caper family Capparaceae but have recently been moved into a new family, Cleomaceae. Cleomella are annual wildflowers native to the dry and desert regions of western North America. They are similar to cleomes in appearance. They are erect and branching with leaves divided into three leaflets and inflorescences of yellow flowers with long stamens. Cleomella species are known commonly as <b>stinkweeds</b> or simply cleomellas.|$|R

It is an annual herb producing a smooth, hairless, reddish stem up to about 45 centimeters tall. There are a few leaves, each made up of three elongated, fleshy leaflets. Most of the flowers are located in a raceme at {{the tips of the}} stem branches, and there may be a few solitary flowers in the axils of the leaves.

50|$|Cleomella obtusifolia is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the cleome family known by the common name Mojave <b>stinkweed.</b> It is native to the Mojave Desert and adjacent hills, where it grows in alkaline soils in the desert scrub. It is an annual herb producing a rough, hairy stem up to 90 centimeters long. The branching stem grows erect when new and then the branches droop {{to the ground with}} age, forming a bushy clump or mat. Each leaf is made up of three fleshy oval leaflets. Flowers appear in dense racemes on older stems and solitary in leaf axils on new stems. Each flower has generally four hairy green sepals and four yellow petals grouped together {{on one side of the}} involucre. The whiskery yellow stamens protrude up to 1.5 centimeters from the flower. The fruit is a hairy, valved capsule a few millimeters in length. It hangs at the tip of the remaining flower receptacle.|$|E
50|$|Cleomella plocasperma is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the cleome family known by the common name twisted cleomella and alkali <b>stinkweed.</b> It is native to the Great Basin and Mojave Desert in the western United States, where it grows mainly in wet, alkaline soils such as those around hot springs. There is a disjunct population in the Bruneau Valley of southwestern Idaho. It grows with other halophytic species such as saltgrass and greasewood. This is an annual herb producing a smooth, hairless stem which divides into several erect or upright branches which may exceed half a meter tall. The sparse leaves are each split into three narrow leaflets. The flowers occur in a raceme {{at the top of}} each stem branch.

40|$|New {{isolates}} Mayfair 2 and Laird 2 of the blackleg fungus [Phoma lingam, {{perfect stage}} Leptosphaeria maculans (Desm.) Ces. et de Not. ] cause blackleg on the traditionally resistant brown mustard (Brassica juncea). Mayfair 2 /Laird 2 isolates of the blackleg fungus produce a {{diverse array of}} secondary metabolites in liquid cultures in minimal media. The isolation (FCC, RP-FCC, prep TLC) and characterization (NMR, MS, X-ray) of these metabolites resulted {{in the identification of}} four groups of compounds: polanrazines, sesquiterpenes, phomapyrones, and depsilairdin, where eleven of them were new. Phytotoxic assays conducted with these metabolites on B. napus (resistant), B. juncea (susceptible), and S. alba (resistant) indicated depsilairdin (122) to be a host-selective toxin. Studies on the biosynthetic origin of phomapyrone A suggested phomapyrones to be of polyketide origin. Sixteen Thlaspi isolates of blackleg fungus originating from Saskatchewan were characterized {{on the basis of their}} secondary metabolite profiles, and it was determined that two of them were Polish type isolates and the remaining fourteen were weakly virulent type isolates. The investigation of Thlaspi arvense (<b>stinkweed)</b> for phytoalexins led to the isolation of two phytoalexins: arvelexin (142) and wasalexin A (38). The structures of these phytoalexins as well as that of isovitexin, a secondary metabolite of T. arvense, were established based on spectroscopic methods and by synthesis. Arvelexin, as a phytoalexin, was reported for the first time here, but wasalexin A was previously reported from wasabi (Wasabia japonica, syn. Eutrema wasabi). Arvelexin (142) exhibited similar antifungal activity as indole- 3 -acetonitrile against L. maculans/P. lingam. The secondary metabolites potentially involved in mediating the interactions between Brassica species and the new blackleg isolates Mayfair 2 and Laird 2 were analysed in infected plant tissues by HPLC. The host-selective toxins phomalairdenone A (55) and depsilairdin (122), and phytoalexins, brassinin (35), rutalexin (137) and spirobrassinin (138) were detected in B. napus, whereas brassilexin (139) and sinalexin (140) were detected in S. alba, and brassilexin (139) was detected in B. juncea...|$|E
