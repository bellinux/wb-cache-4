5|$|The tumor may {{compress}} neighboring organs, disrupting {{digestive processes}} {{and making it}} difficult for the <b>stomach</b> <b>to</b> empty, which may cause nausea and a feeling of fullness. The undigested fat leads to foul-smelling, fatty feces that are difficult to flush away. Constipation is common.|$|E
5|$|Alert to {{the danger}} {{presented}} to his scattered ranks, Richard, prudent as ever, halted and regrouped his forces once more after a further pursuit. The Ayyubid cavalry turned once again, showing they still had <b>stomach</b> <b>to</b> renew the fight. However, a third and final charge caused them to scatter into the woodland where they dispersed into the hills in all directions, showing no inclination to continue the conflict. Richard led his cavalry back to Arsuf where the infantry had pitched camp. During the night the Saracen dead were looted.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{earliest}} cases of rumination {{was that of}} a physician in the nineteenth century, Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard, who acquired the condition as the result of experiments upon himself. As a way of evaluating and testing the acid response of the <b>stomach</b> <b>to</b> various foods, the doctor would swallow sponges tied to a string, then intentionally regurgitate them to analyze the contents. As a result of these experiments, the doctor eventually regurgitated his meals habitually by reflex.|$|E

50|$|HUSS {{also used}} {{the design of the}} Enterprise for a newer {{attraction}} called Fly Away. In this version, riders lay on their <b>stomachs</b> <b>to</b> simulate the feeling of flying. This version also has the capability to spin riders forwards or backwards.|$|R
50|$|Pangolins have a {{very poor}} sense of vision, so they rely heavily on smell and hearing. They use their {{powerful}} front claws to dig into trees, ground, and vegetation to find prey, then proceed to use their long tongues to probe inside the insect tunnels and retrieve their prey. Pangolins lack teeth, so also lack the ability to chew; however, while foraging, they ingest small stones which accumulate in their <b>stomachs</b> <b>to</b> help to grind up ants.|$|R
5|$|The {{processes}} of feeding and capture may be aided by special parts; Pisaster brevispinus, the short-spined pisaster from the West Coast of America, {{can use a}} set of specialized tube feet to dig itself deep into the soft substrate to extract prey (usually clams). Grasping the shellfish, the starfish slowly pries open the prey's shell by wearing out its adductor muscle, and then inserts its everted stomach into the crack to digest the soft tissues. The gap between the valves need only be {{a fraction of a}} millimetre wide for the <b>stomach</b> <b>to</b> gain entry.|$|E
5|$|Later on, {{the priest}} tells Chen {{to visit a}} lunatic beggar at the marketplace, should she wish to revive her husband. The madman treats her with disrespect by {{continuously}} demeaning her, but she takes it in her stride and patiently pleads with him for help. Finally, he coughs out some phlegm and makes her swallow it. The beggar makes his leave and Chen is left feeling deeply ashamed. Back home, during funeral preparations, the phlegm hardens gradually and rises from Chen's <b>stomach</b> <b>to</b> her throat. Ultimately she disgorges a throbbing heart, which she places into the gaping wound in Wang's chest; slowly, his life is restored.|$|E
5|$|A {{blood vessel}} leads {{up the middle}} of the body from the <b>stomach</b> <b>to</b> a {{circular}} vessel {{at the base of the}} lophophore, and from there a single blind vessel runs up each tentacle. A pair of blood vessels near the body wall lead downward from the lophophore ring to the stomach and also to blind branches throughout the body. There is no heart, but the major vessels can contract in waves to move the blood. Phoronids do not ventilate their trunks with oxygenated water, but rely on respiration through the lophophore. The blood contains hemoglobin, which is unusual in such small animals and seems to be an adaptation to anoxic and hypoxic environments. The blood of Phoronis architecta carries twice as much oxygen as a human of the same weight. Two metanephridia filter the body fluid, returning any useful products and dumping the remaining soluble wastes through a pair of pores beside the anus.|$|E

5|$|The {{storm petrel}} nests in crevices and burrows, {{sometimes}} shared with other seabirds or rabbits, and lays a single white egg, usually on bare soil. The adults share the lengthy incubation and both feed the chick, {{which is not}} normally brooded after the first week. This bird is strongly migratory, spending the northern hemisphere winter mainly off the coasts of South Africa and Namibia, with some birds stopping in the seas adjoining West Africa, and a few remaining near their Mediterranean breeding islands. This petrel is strictly oceanic outside the breeding season. It feeds on small fish, squid and zooplankton while pattering on the sea's surface, and can find oily edible items by smell. The food is converted in the bird's <b>stomach</b> <b>to</b> an oily orange liquid which is regurgitated when the chick is fed. Although usually silent at sea, the storm petrel has a chattering call given by both members of a pair in their courtship flight, and the male has a purring song given from the breeding chamber.|$|E
25|$|Water torture: The {{victim was}} tied up and laid flat on the ground. Water was forced through the mouth and nose until the victim's stomach became distended, after which the interrogators would jump on the victim's <b>stomach</b> <b>to</b> force out the water, until the victim lost consciousness.|$|E
25|$|In such {{conditions}} as stomach cancer, tumours may partly block the pyloric canal. A special tube can be implanted surgically {{to connect the}} <b>stomach</b> <b>to</b> the duodenum so as to facilitate the passage of food {{from one to the}} other. This tube is called a gastroduodenostomy.|$|E
2500|$|This {{can also}} be caused by over-eating. In The Gift, Sarah Jane and the gang destroy the food, a plant called Rackweed, which is native to Raxacoricofallapatorius, The rackweed which has been digested sits in their stomachs and when Mr Smith {{triggers}} a sound in the attic it causes them to fart and then their <b>stomachs</b> <b>to</b> explode.|$|R

25|$|The pyloric sphincter, or valve, is {{a strong}} ring of smooth muscle {{at the end of}} the pyloric canal which lets food pass from the <b>stomach</b> <b>to</b> the duodenum. It {{controls}} the outflow of gastric contents into the duodenum. It receives sympathetic innervation from the celiac ganglion.|$|E
25|$|A small {{flexible}} tube (nasogastric tube) may be inserted {{through the nose}} into the <b>stomach</b> <b>to</b> help decompress the dilated bowel. This tube is uncomfortable but does relieve the abdominal cramps, distention, and vomiting. Intravenous therapy is utilized and the urine output is monitored with a catheter in the bladder.|$|E
25|$|Less 'concrete' aspects such as {{the role}} a given entity may play in a {{particular}} scenario (for example {{the role of a}} chemical compound in an experiment) and the function of an entity (for example the digestive function of the <b>stomach</b> <b>to</b> nutriate the body) are also covered in the ontology.|$|E

25|$|The {{condition}} may {{be treated}} conservatively or with surgery. Typically intravenous fluids are given, a tube is placed {{through the nose}} into the <b>stomach</b> <b>to</b> decompress the intestines, and pain medications are given. Antibiotics are often given. In small bowel obstruction about 25% require surgery. Complications may include sepsis, bowel ischemia, and bowel perforation.|$|E
25|$|Metro {{travelers}} are often seen {{keeping a close}} guard on their belongings, as petty or opportunistic theft is a significant problem in Santiago.

25|$|Pyloric {{stenosis}} is a {{narrowing of}} the opening from the <b>stomach</b> <b>to</b> {{the first part of}} the small intestine (the pylorus). Symptoms include projectile vomiting without the presence of bile. This most often occurs after the baby is fed. The typical age that symptoms become obvious is two to twelve weeks old.|$|E

5000|$|Gastrin: This is an {{important}} hormone produced by the [...] "G cells" [...] of the stomach. G cells produce gastrin in response <b>to</b> <b>stomach</b> stretching occurring after food enters it, and also after <b>stomach</b> exposure <b>to</b> protein. Gastrin is an endocrine hormone and therefore enters the bloodstream and eventually returns <b>to</b> the <b>stomach</b> where it stimulates parietal cells to produce hydrochloric acid (HCl) and Intrinsic factor (IF).|$|R
25|$|In {{birds and}} crocodilians, the stomach {{is divided into}} two regions. Anteriorly is a narrow tubular region, the proventriculus, lined by fundic glands, and {{connecting}} the true <b>stomach</b> <b>to</b> the crop. Beyond lies the powerful muscular gizzard, lined by pyloric glands, and, in some species, containing stones that the animal swallows to help grind up food.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{contains}} casein, {{a substance}} that breaks down in the human <b>stomach</b> <b>to</b> produce casomorphin, an opioid peptide. In the early 1990s {{it was hypothesized that}} casomorphin can cause or aggravate autism spectrum disorders, and casein-free diets are widely promoted. Studies supporting these claims have had significant flaws, and the data are inadequate to guide autism treatment recommendations.|$|E
25|$|Galen's ideas {{prevailed in}} {{medicine}} until the 17th century. It {{was thought that}} blood was produced by the liver from chyle contaminated with ailments by the intestine and <b>stomach,</b> <b>to</b> which various spirits were added by other organs, and that this blood was consumed by all the organs of the body. This theory required that the blood be consumed and produced many times over. Even in the 17th century, his ideas were defended by some physicians.|$|E
50|$|Gastropexy is a {{surgical}} operation {{in which the}} <b>stomach</b> is sutured <b>to</b> the abdominal wall or the diaphragm. Gastropexys in which the <b>stomach</b> is sutured <b>to</b> the diaphragm are sometimes performed as a treatment of GERD <b>to</b> prevent the <b>stomach</b> from moving up into the chest.|$|R

25|$|In 1854, Alexander McDougall and Angus Smith {{developed}} and patented a product called McDougall's Powder as a sewer deodorant; it was mainly composed from carbolic acid derived from creosote. McDougall, in 1864, experimented with his solution to remove entozoa parasites from cattle pasturing on a sewage farm. This later led to {{widespread use of}} creosote as a cattle wash and sheep dip. External parasites would be killed in a creosote diluted dip, and drenching tubes {{would be used to}} administer doses <b>to</b> the animals' <b>stomachs</b> <b>to</b> kill internal parasites.|$|R
