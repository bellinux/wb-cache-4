Research on <b>Single</b> <b>Cell</b> <b>Protein</b> Technology started {{a century ago}} when Max Delbrück and his colleagues found out the high value of surplus brewer’s yeast as a feeding supplement for animals. During World War I and World War II, yeast-SCP was employed {{on a large scale}} in Germany to counteract food shortages during the war. Inventions for SCP production often represented milestones for biotechnology in general: for example, in 1919, Sak in Denmark and Hayduck in Germany invented a method named, “Zulaufverfahren”, (fed-batch) in which sugar solution was fed continuously to an aerated suspension of yeast instead of adding yeast to diluted sugar solution once (batch). In post war period, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) emphasized on hunger and malnutrition problems of the world in 1960 and introduced the concept of protein gap, showing that 25% of the world population had a deficiency of protein intake in their diet. It was also feared that agricultural production would fail to meet the increasing demands of food by humanity.

STM screening was also employed for the evaluation of three predicted sortase transpeptidase enzymes, which mediate the cell surface presentation of <b>cell</b> wall-anchored <b>proteins.</b> The sortase A mutant exhibited a modest (∼ 2 -fold) reduction in competitiveness, while the other two sortase mutants were indistinguishable from the parental strain. The combined results suggest that while <b>cell</b> wall-anchored <b>proteins</b> may play a role in S. sanguinis infective endocarditis, strategies designed to interfere with individual <b>cell</b> wall-anchored <b>proteins</b> or sortases would not be effective for disease prevention...|$|R

Tilapia culture {{is also one of}} the fastest growing farming activities, with an average annual growth rate of 13. 4 % during 1970 – 2002. They are widely cultured in about 100 countries in the tropical and subtropical regions. As a result, the production of farmed tilapia has increased from 383, 654 mt in 1990 to 1, 505, 804 mt in 2002, representing about 6 % of total farmed finfish in 2002. Feeding represents over 50 % of the operational costs of aquaculture. Fish meal has been widely used as a main conventional protein source in aquafeeds. However, the dependence on fish meal is expected to decline due to the shortage in world production of fish meal, and increased demand for fish meal in feeds for livestock and poultry industries. Therefore, partial or total replacement of fish meal with less expensive, locally available protein sources will become inevitable. Many attempts have been conducted alongside this line. The present review throws the light on alternative dietary protein sources for farmed tilapia, with emphasis on the most cost effective, commonly used sources, such as fishery by-products, terrestrial animal by-products, oilseed plants, aquatic plants, <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> <b>proteins,</b> grain legumes, plant protein concentrates and cereal by-products. The nutritive values, inclusion levels, constraints and economic evaluation of these sources are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} {{studying}} the proteome is {{to better understand}} the activity of <b>cells</b> at the <b>single</b> <b>cells</b> level. Since <b>proteins</b> are responsible for determining how the cell acts, understanding the proteome of <b>single</b> <b>cell</b> gives the best understanding of how a cell operates, and how gene expression changes in a cell due to different environmental stimuli. Although transcriptomics has the same purpose as proteomics it is not as accurate at determining gene expression in cells as it {{does not take into account}} post-transcriptional regulation. Transcriptomics is still important as studying the difference between RNA levels and protein levels could give insight on which genes are post-transcriptionally regulated.|$|R
