Systems originally designed for desktop use were placed on shelves inside of 19&#8209;inch racks, sometimes requiring that part of their cases be cut off {{in order for them}} to fit. Since the late 1990s, pizza boxes have been a common form factor in data centers or industrial applications where rack space and density are critical.

Referring to the 40/4, modern critics have noted that “It is unsurpassed to this day in engineering sophistication and production”.

5000|$|The {{first patent}} for a pizza box made of {{corrugated}} cardboard was applied in 1963 and it already displayed {{the characteristics of}} today's pizza packaging: plane blanks, foldability without need of adhesive, <b>stackability</b> and ventilation slots. The combination of such slots along with water vapour absorbing materials (absorption agent) prevented the humidity build-ups that characterized traditional transport packaging.It is assumed that the pizza box was invented by Domino's Pizza, {{even if they did}} not file a patent application. Until 1988 this chain employed a type of packaging whose front side was not directly connected to the lateral sides, but rather the flaps fixed to the lateral sides were folded inward under the lid. This design is also known as [...] "Chicago folding". Domino's was the first pizza producer which employed pizza boxes on a large scale and in this way expanded its delivery range beyond the area immediately close to the pizzeria. Towards the end of the 1960s, the delivery service was further developed thanks to the introduction of heat-insulating bags.|$|E
50|$|Plastic pallets {{are often}} made of new HDPE or {{recycled}} PET (drink bottles). They are usually extremely durable, lasting {{for a hundred}} trips or more, and resist weathering, rot, chemicals and corrosion. The benefits of plastic pallets over wood pallets include {{the ability to be}} easily sanitized, resistance to odor, fire retardancy, longer service life span, durability and better product protection, non-splintering, and lighter weight, thus saving on transportation and labor costs and making them safer and more environmentally friendly.They often stack. Plastic pallets are exempt by inspection for biosafety concerns, and easily sanitize for international shipping. HDPE is impervious to most acids and toxic chemicals clean from them more easily. Some plastic pallets can collapse from plastic creep if used to store heavy loads for long periods. Plastic pallets cannot easily be repaired, and can be ten times as expensive as hardwood, so they are often used by logistics service providers who can profit from their durability and <b>stackability.</b> The large supply chains have increased the use of plastic pallets as many organisations seek to reduce costs through waste, transport and health & safety. Pallets and dolly combined for example the Pally eliminate pallet instability and the need for additional lifting equipment, but also create valuable space in busy operating environments and deliver significant time and cost savings by reducing supply chain handling. Plastics' reusability has contributed to an increase in usage of plastic pallets.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technical}} ability to record and manipulate larger databases more quickly has now enabled {{a new breed}} of supply chain optimization solutions to emerge, which are capable of forecasting at a much more granular level (for example, per article per customer per day). Some vendors are applying [...] "best fit" [...] models to this data, to which safety stock rules are applied, while other vendors have started to apply stochastic techniques to the optimization problem. They calculate the most desirable inventory level per article for each individual store for their retail customers, trading off cost of inventory against expectation of sale. The resulting optimized inventory level is known as a model stock. Meeting the model stock level is also an area requiring optimization. Because the movement of product to meet the model stock, called the stock transfer, needs to be in economic shipping units such as complete unit loads or a full truckload, there are a series of decisions that must be made. Many existing distribution requirements planning systems round the quantity up to the nearest full shipping unit. The creation of for example, truckloads as economic shipment units requires optimization systems to ensure that axle constraints and space constraints are met while loading can be achieved in a damage-free way. This is generally achieved by continuing to add time-phased requirements until the loads meet some minimum weight or cube. More sophisticated optimization algorithms take into account <b>stackability</b> constraints, load and unloading rules, palletizing logic, warehouse efficiency and load stability with an objective to reduce transportation spend (minimize 'shipping air'). Optimization solutions are typically part of, or linked to, the company's replenishment systems distribution requirements planning, so that orders can be automatically generated to maintain the model stock profile. The algorithms used are similar to those used in making financial investment decisions; the analogy is quite precise, as inventory can be considered to be an investment in prospective return on sales.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} the geometric problem of stackabilization: how to geometrically modify a 3 D object {{so that it}} is more amenable to stacking. Given a 3 D object and a stacking direction, we define a measure of <b>stackability,</b> which is derived from the gap between the lower and upper envelopes of the object in a stacking configuration along the stacking direction. The main challenge in stackabilization lies in the desire to modify the object’s geometry only subtly so that the intended functionality and aesthetic appearance of the original object are not significantly affected. We present an automatic algorithm to deform a 3 D object to meet a target <b>stackability</b> score using energy minimization. The optimized energy accounts for both the scales of the deformation parameters as well as the preservation of pre-existing geometric and structural properties in the object, e. g., symmetry, as a means of maintaining its functionality. We also present an intelligent editing tool that assists a modeler when modifying a given 3 D object to improve its <b>stackability.</b> Finally, we explore a few fun variations of the stackabilization problem...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} two issues: 1. (1) What {{it means}} for a higher-order, eager functional language to be implemented with a single, global, stack-based environment and 2. (2) how {{the existence of such}} an environment can be predicted statically. The central theme is the use of the λ-abstraction to control the extent or lifetime of bindings. All programs in a higher-order, call-by-name language can be implemented with a stack environment. The reason: soundness of η-expansion and decurrying for call-by-name. However, η-expansion is unsound for call-by-value. Hence, we must identify a subset of the simply typed, call-by-value λ-calculus, where the λ-abstraction can serve as the block construct for a stack implementation. The essence of environment <b>stackability</b> is that the shape of the environment remains the same before and after the execution of an expression. Thus, if a closure is returned as a value, the environment trapped in it must be a subenvironment of the global environment. This yields a dynamic criterion for <b>stackability</b> — indeed, it is the downwards funargs criterion of the LISP community. A safe static criterion can now be found via closure analysis...|$|E

30|$|To {{resolve the}} {{physical}} scaling issues of conventional nonvolatile memory devices, crossbar array architecture {{has been considered}} as an attractive construction due to the scalability, simplicity, and multiple <b>stackability</b> of the structure. For practical applications, the foremost bottleneck of this array architecture is the sneak current path issue, which leads to read operation error [241]. ZnO-based RRAM having crossbar structures has also suffered from sneak path issue. To suppress the undesired sneak current, the combination of memory cells with rectifying or switch devices, such as p-n junction diodes [242], Schottky diodes [243, 244], threshold switching devices [245], and transistors [246], is necessary. In this section, we will discuss about the different aspects to eliminate sneak path for the ZnO-based RRAM.|$|E

40|$|Space-saving, or collapsible, {{objects are}} {{ubiquitous}} {{in our living}} and working space. They can adjust configurations to either perform their intended functionality or save space, for example, while storing and shipping. This additional space-saving characteristic of changing forms makes collapsible objects more preferable than their non-collapsible counterparts, especially in environments where space is costly. Shape compaction is an important real-world design problem, where a 3 D object is geometrically modified, such {{that it can be}} more compactly stored by changing to a different configuration, while preserving its functionality and aesthetic. This thesis argues the need for computational tools to support shape compaction of 3 D objects and proposes novel algorithms to support the compaction via stacking and folding. The first problem is stackabilization [...] - making objects more amenable to stacking. As a group collapsing principle, a collection of shapes can cooperatively occupy less space when stacked than they do individually. Given a 3 D object and a stacking direction, a measure of <b>stackability</b> is defined to reflect the space-saving ratio of stacking the given object along the given stacking direction. The stackabilization algorithm deforms the input 3 D object to meet a target <b>stackability</b> score using energy minimization. This energy accounts for the scales of the deformation parameters as well as the preservation of per-existing geometric and structural properties in the objects. The second problem is foldabilization [...] - modifying the input 3 D object such that it can be folded into a flat configuration along a prescribed direction. Folding an object involves rearranging its parts via hinging; the folded part configuration usually occupies less space than the unfolded one. The input 3 D object is first abstracted into a scaffold, which consists of a collection of connected planar patches. The foldabilization algorithm minimizes the amount of modifications, e. g. shrinking and split, on these patches such that the modified scaffold can be folded into a flat configuration. Structure soundness is considered by allowing slanted folding and patch disconnection, which usually result in fewer splits on the input scaffold. The fully automatic foldabilization results can be computed at interactive speed. The prototypes can be fabricated while folded for cost-effective printing, and unfolded to show their usage configurations...|$|E
40|$|A novel route was {{developed}} to fabricate anode-supported solid oxide fuel cells with a high throughput and low manufacturing costs. In contrast to classical manufacturing routes, this novel route starts with the tape casting of the thin electrolyte followed by the tape casting of the anode and anode support. All three layers were cast green-on-green and finally sintered to yield a gas-tight electrolyte. By carefully selecting the raw materials for all three layers, {{it is possible to}} manufacture near-net-shape half-cells. The half-cells were characterized with respect to thickness, microstructure, bending behavior, electrolyte gas leakage, shrinkage, electrolyte residual stresses, and mechanical strength. Finally, the cathode was screen-printed and fired, and the full cell characteristics were obtained in single-cell and stack tests.

40|$|Car sharing is {{expected}} to reduce traffic congestion and pollution in cities {{while at the same}} time improving accessibility to public transport. However, the most popular form of car sharing, one-way car sharing, still suffers from the vehicle unbalance problem. Innovative solutions to this issue rely on custom vehicles with stackable capabilities: customers or operators can drive a train of vehicles if necessary, thus efficiently bringing several cars from an area with few requests to an area with many requests. However, how to model a car sharing system with stackable vehicles is an open problem in the related literature. In this paper, we propose a queueing theoretical model to fill this gap, and we use this model to derive an upper-bound on user-based relocation capabilities. We also validate, for the first time in the related literature, legacy queueing theoretical models against a trace of real car sharing data. Finally, we present preliminary results about the impact, on car availability, of simple user-based relocation heuristics with stackable vehicles. Our results indicate that user-based relocation schemes that exploit vehicle <b>stackability</b> can significantly improve car availability at stations.

40|$|The {{missing link}} between a {{nonlinear}} circuit element that {{is able to}} selfadjust its conductance according {{to the history of}} applied voltage/current and physical realizations of two-terminal oxide-based resistive memory was discovered in early 2008, and has since been intensively studied. This class of memory elements is called memristive devices, which includes resistive random access memories (RRAM), phase change memories (PCM) and spin-transfer torque magnetoresistive memories (STT-MRAM). Memristive devices are mostly CMOS and fab friendly, and promise simpler architecture, higher scalability and <b>stackability</b> (3 D), good selectivity, relatively low-power consumption, high endurance and retention, fast operation by utilizing parallelism, and the most important of all, the ability to merge logic and memory. A signiﬁcantly wide range of resistive switching materials can be categorized under three main redox-related effects, electrochemical metalization effects (ECM), valency change memory effect (VCM) and thermochemical memory effects (TCM). Although, the behavior of these resistive memories can be modeled using high-level ﬁnite-state machines (FSMs), the underlying switching mechanisms is yet to be fully understood. Despite the lack of comprehensive understanding of the switching behavior, their application in memory and computing has been constantly improved. These devices can be programmed to exhibit multi-level cell (MLC) and binary cell behavior, thus analog and digital memories can be exists in one device depends on programming.

40|$|In {{the project}} the {{efficient}} packing of a consignment of smaller boxes (products) {{of various types}} on a minimal number of standard Euro pallets is considered. Hereby a lot of practical restrictions has to be regarded such as completeness of a box type on a pallet, visibility conditions, stability requirements, <b>stackability</b> of {{a subset of the}} pallets, weight, and geometric restrictions. The solution approach is based on a branch-and-bound framework involving the optimal packing of single pallets, the calculation of optimal packing patterns for sub-consignments (such as optimal layer patterns) and new efficient bounds which are based on a so-called bar-packing relaxation. The theoretical investigations with respect to the G 4 -structure leads to a new algorithm to solve optimally pallet loading problems (with identical pieces) for the most instances of practical interest. These investigations are generalized to problems where several types of boxes may be contained in a pattern in order to compute optimal packing patterns also for instances with small order demands. The quality of the solutions found can be characterized with the help of new bounds so that their optimality can be proven in a lot of cases.

40|$|Tortuous microchannels have {{attracted}} increasing interest due to great potential to enhance fluid mixing and heat transfer. While the fluid flow and heat transfer in wavy microchannels {{have been studied}} extensively in a numerical fashion, experimental studies are very limited due to the technical difficulties of making accurate measurements in micro-scale flows. This thesis provides insights into thermohydraulics of tortuous microchannels by developing experimental techniques and performing systematic visualisation and heat transfer experiments. The detailed flow patterns (including Dean vortices) and transition behaviours in wavy channels are successfully identified using Micro-Particle Image Velocimetry (micro-PIV) and 3 D reconstruction techniques. Conjugate heat transfer simulations are carried out to understand the complex thermal behaviour present in the current experimental design and to validate and compare with experimental results. The impact of tortuous geometry on flow and heat transfer in microchannels is studied systematically. The high quality experimental data provide {{a new perspective on}} flow behaviour and heat transfer performance in wavy microchannels. In addition, the <b>stackability</b> of channels on a plate is considered. The zigzag pathways are found to provide the greatest heat transfer intensification based on a plate structure. A significant component of the research in this thesis has been the development of experimental techniques to measure local heat transfer rates in microchannels. A two-dye laser induced fluorescence (LIF) technique using temperature sensitive particles (TSPs) is developed with promising characteristics for local temperature measurement and the capability for simultaneous measurement of temperature and velocity fields in microscale systems.

40|$|The {{container}} loading problem {{considered in}} this thesis is to determine placements {{of a set of}} packages within one or multiple shipping containers. Smaller packages are consolidated on pallets prior to being loaded in the shipping containers together with larger packages. There are multiple objectives which may be summarized as fitting all the packages while achieving good stability of the cargo as well as the shipping containers themselves. According to recent literature reviews, previous research in the field have to large extent been neglecting issues relevant in practice. Our real-world application was developed for the industrial company Atlas Copco to be used for sea container shipments at their Distribution Center (DC) in Texas, USA. Hence all applicable practical constraints faced by the DC operators had to be treated properly. A high variety in sizes, weights and other attributes such as <b>stackability</b> among packages added complexity to an already challenging combinatorial problem. Inspired by how the DC operators plan and perform loading manually, the batch concept was developed, which refers to grouping of boxes based on their characteristics and solving subproblems in terms of partial load plans. In each batch, an extensive placement heuristic and a load plan evaluation run iteratively, guided by a Genetic Algorithm (GA). In the placement heuristic, potential placements are evaluated using a scoring function considering aspects of the current situation, such as space utilization, horizontal support and heavier boxes closer to the floor. The scoring function is weighted by coefficients corresponding to the chromosomes of an individual in the GA population. Consequently, the fitness value of an individual in the GA population is the rating of a load plan. The loading optimization software has been tested and successfully implemented at the DC in Texas. The software has been proven capable of generating satisfactory load plans within acceptable computation times, which has resulted in reduced uncertainty and labor usage in the loading process. Analysis using real sea container shipments shows that the GA is able to tune the scoring coefficients to suit the particular problem instance being solved...|$|E
40|$|A Thesis Submitted In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements For the Degree of Master of Science - Biology MicrobiologyAnaerobic {{digestion}} (AD) facilities {{provide a}} {{renewable energy source}} while also diverting organic material from landfills. In 2011, UW Oshkosh built the first "dry" anaerobic digester in North America. Biogas in this facility is generated from the anaerobic digestion of organic feedstock material, and used to fuel a {{combined heat and power}} unit (CHP) that generates electricity and heat for the university. The organic materials that serve as a source of feedstock for biogas generation is influenced greatly by the seasonality of the region where a biogas system operates. The overall objective of this research was to evaluate the various feedstocks used at the UW Oshkosh dry digester and determine if feedstock changes had an impact on plant performance. Both actual operational data collected during {{the first two years of}} operation and a bench-scale biogas system were utilized to see the impact of feedstock changes on biogas output. In addition to biogas output, physical and chemical analyses on the feedstocks was conducted to help elucidate the impact of the many feedstock variables. Two critical parameters that were monitored for each feedstock were dry matter (DM) and organic dry matter (oDM). These parameters were chosen due to the fact that facility operators use DM metrics to monitor total recipe for <b>stackability</b> and drainage purposes, and oDM content is what drives biogas production. DM and oDM tests were conducted on all incoming feedstocks at the UW Oshkosh dry digester over a two year period. At the same time biogas production was also evaluated on almost a real-time basis. Within the bench-scale biogas system, food waste generated the largest biogas yield, 3092 Average Standardized Gas Volume (mL) generated. Statistical analyses conducted on the data collected as part of this project indicate that there is a significant relationship between biogas output and the seasonal influence on feedstock oDM content.
