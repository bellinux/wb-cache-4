Hull was promoted to interim co-general manager of the Stars, sharing the role with Les Jackson after Doug Armstrong was fired on November 13, 2007. ESPN analyst Scott Burnside criticized the promotion of Hull, noting his lack of front office experience and questionable work ethic.|$|E

40|$|Democratic {{governance}} in Northern Ireland is consociational (i. e. power sharing is mandatory). The role of <b>Special</b> <b>Advisers</b> within mandatory coalitions has received little attention from scholars, {{despite the fact}} that consociationalism is increasingly prescribed as a solution to fragmented conflict ridden societies across the world. Drawing on data from elite interviews with Government Information Officers, <b>Special</b> <b>Advisers</b> and journalists, this paper utilises a discursive framework to analyse their perspectives on the impact and role of <b>Special</b> <b>Advisers</b> in Northern Ireland’s devolved, power-sharing government. In particular, we consider how <b>Special</b> <b>Advisers</b> impact on the communication of departmental and Executive policy. Initial findings suggest that while <b>Special</b> <b>Advisers</b> function similarly to those working elsewhere inWestminster model democracies, the post-conflict and politically volatile consociational context in Northern Ireland adds additional complexity to their role. SpAds not only articulate issues to the media but also play an important diplomatic role in inter-party negotiation and conflict resolution between the five ideologically opposed parties in government. <b>Special</b> <b>Advisers</b> in Northern Ireland therefore not only communicate their minister’s political priorities and policy decisions, but also {{play a crucial role in}} the development and maintenance of internal and external working relationships across the consociational governing administration. This paper adds to our knowledge of <b>Special</b> <b>Advisers</b> in democratic societies by evaluating their role in what is, by Western European standards, a relatively unique political system...|$|R

5|$|In 1997, Lu left Sidley Austin {{and took}} his first job in the {{political}} arena as deputy chief counsel for Representative Henry Waxman and the Democratic staff of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee of the House of Representatives. Phil Schiliro, Waxman's chief of staff, had a large part in the decision to hire Lu; the two would work together again later on the Obama administration; Lu later said he considers Schiliro and Pete Rouse, another future White House staffer, among his most influential mentors. During his tenure with the Government Reform Committee, Lu conducted several high-profile investigations, including investigations into campaign fundraising during the 1996 presidential election, the collapse of Enron, and substandard nursing home conditions. Lu also served as <b>special</b> <b>adviser</b> for communications to Senator John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. One of his primary duties there was coordinating the activities of families of September 11 attack victims supporting the Kerry campaign.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving office}} as CGS, Dannatt {{effectively}} {{retired from the}} Army, but technically remained a serving officer until November 2009. Shortly after leaving office, Dannatt was approached by David Cameron, then leader of the Conservative Party and Leader of the Opposition. Cameron invited Dannatt to become a defence adviser for the Shadow Cabinet once he was officially retired from the Army and no longer bound by Queen's Regulations, which mandate political neutrality in the armed forces. Although uncommon for a former service chief to align himself with one political party, Dannatt accepted the role on an informal basis. The timing of the decision, which became public in October 2009—within two months of Dannatt's effective retirement—attracted some controversy, with some former ministers and civil servants suggesting it potentially compromised the neutrality of the armed forces. He advised Cameron and his shadow cabinet until he resigned, shortly after the 2010 general election, stating that Cameron, by then prime minister, should turn to the incumbent chiefs of staff for defence advice and citing no desire to become a <b>special</b> <b>adviser.</b>|$|E
5|$|Soedjatmoko {{returned}} to Indonesia in 1971; {{upon his return}} he became <b>Special</b> <b>Adviser</b> on Social and Cultural Affairs to the Chairman of the National Development Planning Agency. That same year, he became {{a board member of}} the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development, a position which he held until 1976; he also joined the Club of Rome. In 1972 Soedjatmoko was selected to the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation, in which position he served 12 years; also in 1972 he became a governor of the Asian Institute of Management, a position which he held for two years. The following year he became a governor of the International Development Research Center. In 1974, based on falsified documents, he was accused of planning the Malari incident of January 1974, in which students protested and eventually rioted during a state visit by Prime Minister of Japan Kakuei Tanaka. Held for interrogation for two and a half weeks, Soedjatmoko was not allowed to leave Indonesia for two and a half years for his suspected involvement.|$|E
