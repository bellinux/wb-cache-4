500|$|López {{is perhaps}} best known for his role as the setup {{reliever}} for the Tigers during their 1984 championship season, when he finished with a 101 record, 14 saves, and a 2.94 ERA. López had a 10 record in both the 1984 American League Championship Series (ALCS) and 1984 World Series, and he did not give up an earned run in over six innings pitched that postseason. He faced seven batters in Game Five of the 1984 World Series, retiring them all. After the pitcher got out of two extra-inning jams to earn a 1984 ALCS win, Detroit manager Sparky Anderson said, [...] "Nothing <b>surprises</b> <b>me</b> about Lopez. I've had him for five years and believe me, there's nothing like him. He's got heart and there is none better. He's one of the all-time hearts." [...] While in Detroit, López had earned the nickname [...] "Señor Smoke", as he hailed from Mexico and threw a powerful fastball.|$|E
2500|$|... – Mohammad Hamid Ansari then {{chairman}} of India's National Commission for Minorities said: [...] "The language {{used by the}} Pope sounds like that of his 12th-Century counterpart who ordered the crusades... It <b>surprises</b> <b>me</b> because the Vatican has a very comprehensive relationship with the Muslim world." [...] It must be noted, however, {{that this was the}} personal reaction of Ansari, and no official statement was ever released on the controversy.|$|E
2500|$|The loves {{of women}} {{for each other}} grow more {{numerous}} each day, and I have pondered much why these things were. That so little should be said about them <b>surprises</b> <b>me,</b> for they are everywhere.... In these days when any capable and careful woman can honorably earn her own support, there is no village that has not its examples of 'two hearts in counsel,' {{both of which are}} feminine.

2500|$|In his {{entry for}} November 27, 1935, Sebastian concludes: [...] "I am {{waiting for the}} day when [...] make their peace with Sandu Tudor [...] and {{discover}} that the Jews are alone responsible for the quarrel—especially myself, who has aroused discord among the Christian fraternity. It sounds like a joke, but it's plausible enough." [...] Almost a year later, when Credința focused its attack on Sebastian, the latter noted: [...] "The only thing that <b>surprises</b> <b>me</b> is that the attack came so late." [...] Tudor and Stancu were defeated in court, and were obliged to formally recant. Ornea, who writes that Credința only published the verdict with much reluctance and discretion ("somewhere deep in the pages of one issue"), concludes that the scandal was a decisive blow for Criterion, causing Eliade's club to dissolve itself.|$|E
2500|$|On October 1, 2008, {{creator of}} the {{original}} Todd and Marty rape storyline, Malone, shared his thoughts with TV Guide about the romance controversy. [...] "On one hand, it <b>surprises</b> <b>me</b> because Ron has been a far more conventional soap writer than I was, [...] "Malone stated. [...] "He’s also a great lover of the form, and {{has worked in the}} form for a long time. Ron loves the conventions and traditions of the form. So, my first reaction is, I’m surprised." [...] Malone said that the character (Marty) having amnesia [...] "literally erases the real moral consequences and the real spiritual journey Marty has embarked on. It’s like telling Othello he’s White and Desdemona doesn’t really die. Presumably, Marty will gain her memory, and what will happen? She will be horrified". Malone agreed that Todd had now [...] "raped Marty in the worst possible way" [...] but that this type of story [...] coming out of nowhere". [...] "In this genre, General Hospitals Luke and Laura have a long history. This kind of story is profoundly founded on hope, forgiveness and redemption," [...] he said. [...] "That’s why it goes to its most radical narrative position. That someone can forgive this ultimate crime is redemptive both for the person forgiven, and the forgiver." [...] Malone said he had faith in Carlivati's storytelling but that the story would have been different and possibly not romantic if he himself had been writing it. [...] "Anyone can tell a story, {{and one of the reasons}} people mock soaps is because you can only read plot," [...] he said. [...] "Writing a story is about the depths of the character and the relationships of the character, and the beauty in which the story is told." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{rivalry between}} the Spurs and the Phoenix Suns {{began in the}} 1990s when the Spurs were led by [...] "The Admiral", David Robinson, and the Suns were {{propelled}} {{by a number of}} players including Dan Majerle, Kevin Johnson, and Tom Chambers. The rivalry continued into the next decade with Tim Duncan leading the Spurs and with the Suns headed by Steve Nash. In 2003, the Spurs beat the Suns 4–2 in the first round. In 2005, the Spurs beat the Suns 4–1 in the Conference Finals. In 2007, the Spurs beat the Suns 4–2 in a Conference Semi-finals series that was notable for putting the two best teams remaining in the NBA against each other. There was a controversial ruling in game 4 when Diaw and Stoudemire left the bench during an altercation and were suspended for game 5. In 2008, the Spurs beat the Suns 4–1 in the first round. Tim Duncan hit a three-pointer to force overtime and win the series. In 2010, the Suns swept the Spurs in four games in the playoffs, including a big time performance by Goran Dragic in game 3, against the team who originally drafted him, scoring 23 fourth quarter points, which amounted to 26 points in thirteen minutes. The rivalry has cooled off, with the Spurs winning most of the meetings, but that wasn't the case on February 21, 2014, where the Suns blew out the road-weary Spurs, who were ending the Rodeo Road Trip in Phoenix, 106–85. Markieff Morris of the Suns lead all scorers with 26 points. Danny Green lead the Spurs with a low 15 points. On April 11, 2014, the Spurs clinched the league-best record, and at the same time, handing the Suns a loss that would keep them out of the postseason, winning 112–104, with Danny Green setting a career high 33 points. In a pre-season game on October 16, 2014, Suns owner Robert Sarver apologized to the Phoenix crowd for the game, where the Spurs rested 5 people, including Popovich. Pop would only end his statement about the incident with, [...] "The only thing that <b>surprises</b> <b>me</b> is that he didn't say it in a chicken suit." ...|$|E
