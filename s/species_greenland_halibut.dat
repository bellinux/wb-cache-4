During 2008 and 2009 the sampling coverage of the fishing effort was 20. 6 % and 16. 5 %, respectively. Data showed a reduced (4. 3 % in weight) but highly variable discard rate. The main discarded species were the macrourids Macrourus berglax, Coryphaenoides rupestris and Nezumia bairdi, together with other 2 fish species: Antimora rostrata and Amblyraja radiata.

40|$|This paper reports an {{analysis}} of the depth distribution of effort and CPUE of the Spanish fleet, as well as undersized fish proportions and mature rates in the Spanish catches of five different <b>species</b> (<b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut,</b> American plaice, cod, yellowtail flounder, skate). Data were collected by the Spanish scientific observer program in the areas NAFO Div. 3 LMNO during the period 1996 - 2000. More than 80 % of the annual effort is carried out in the strata of 600 - 800, 800 - 1000 and > 1000 meters. The species with highest yields in these strata is the Greenland halibut. 10 % of the effort is carried out in the stratum of < 200 meters and within this the highest yields correspond to skate and American plaice. The proportion of mature fish in the catches depends on depth for Greenland halibut and skate, whilst {{for the rest of the}} species the proportions of mature fish are bigger and more stable. The percentage of oversized fish is quite high, bigger than 95 % in all species and ranges of depth...|$|E

Gillnet fleets were deployed at depths of between 537 and 677 m, and soak time varied from one to seven days. Four fleets set 45 days earlier were also retrieved during the cruise. Most of the catch (94 %) consisted of the target <b>species</b> <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides). All individuals were categorized according to seven condition stages ranging from “alive with no injuries” to “only bones remaining”. Results revealed that fish could be fully decomposed/consumed within a 24 -hour period, probably due to amphipod and isopod scavenger activity. A decline in total catches was first observed after five days whereas catch composition remained stable during the first seven days. After 45 days a relatively high total catch was obtained but only 25 % were still at stages 1 - 4 (consumable). The cumulative catch after 45 days was estimated at 2. 7 and 3. 0 tons on the basis of two different methods. Gillnets retrieved after 45 days were evaluated as being highly effective, with gear saturation being the only factor leading to decreased efficiency...|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is {{recruitment}} processes in <b>Greenland</b> <b>Halibut</b> (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) in West Greenland waters. The focal point is <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut’s</b> early life history from oocytes {{in the female}} ovary - to larvae living in the pelagic - to juveniles on the sea bottom. These early life stages are examined in four studies: Ovary and oocyte development in adult female <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> was studied in Davis Strait, Disko Bay and Baffin Bay. The objective {{of this study was}} to track and compare ovary development from winter to autumn from the inshore fjords of Disko Bay, Baffin Bay and the presumed spawning area in Davis Strait. Results showed that maturity was much more progressed in Davis Strait compared to the two other areas. Furthermore, almost all adult female fish in Davis Strait showed signs of maturation while only a fraction of the larger females (> 80 cm length) were mature in Disko and Baffin Bay. A large proportion of the <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> in Disko and Baffin Bay did not appear to begin the maturation cycle until very late in their life history and/or were repeat spawners with a multiyear maturation cycle. Thus the observations from Disko and Baffin Bay support the theory that <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> can have a prolonged adolescent phase. The result from the study also strongly indicated that Davis Strait was the only major spawning area in West Greenland. Larvae distribution and growth of <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> and Sandeel (Ammodytes sp.) was studied across the West Greenland shelf. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyse spatial distribution and growth during three periods May, June and July and relate these to cross shelf variability in biological and hydrographical conditions in order to identify areas of special importance for larval growth and survival. Results showed that in May small <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> larvae, some still with small remains of the yolk-sac, were primarily distributed offshore in Davis Strait. Their distribution coincided with their prey resources while some vagrant larvae were dispersed to areas with less food, which likely resulted in higher mortality rates. Consequently, the emergence of first feeding <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> larvae matched their prey in time and space which is believed to be crucial for survival success at this critical stage in their development. From June to July <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> larvae gradually shifted their distribution from the bank slopes to the deeper parts of the slope near the shelf break. The lack of clear and well-defined frontal zones made it difficult to evaluate the hydrographical processes that had significance for larval distribution patterns. <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> larvae did, however, show preference for stratified water masses. Growth analysis of <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> larvae was only possible for July and showed higher growth was observed at stations positioned in frontal zones suggesting that growth was significantly influenced by the level of frontal activity. The study also included distribution and growth comparisons with sandeel. The larvae of sandeel was considerably more associated to the banks and bank slopes than <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> larvae in all three months (May-July), however in June, the two species coexisted considerably in the same areas of the cross shelf. The growth analysis showed that sandeel and <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> larvae showed opposite responses to some hydrographical conditions and prey abundance. Sandeel growth decreased with increasing frontal activity and increased with increasing prey biomass. The later observation suggests that sandeel growth was limited by food availability. Cross shelf variation in growth in <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> larvae showed that enhanced growth was observed at some stations where they were most abundant. Overall, however, there was no clear association between larval growth and larval abundances for neither <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> nor sandeel larvae. The observed patchiness in larval distribution could therefore also be a result of retention mechanisms and / or predation mortality. The feeding ecology of pelagic <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> and sandeel larvae was studied across the West Greenland shelf. The aim of this study was to analyse and compare feeding ecology of coexisting <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> and sandeel larvae. Diet analysis and prey preference considerations were used to assess spatial variation in prey availability and feeding. The hypothesis was that feeding conditions are optimal in central areas of fish larval distribution, and that timing of larval emergence is synchronised with prey availability. The study showed that for both species copepods were the main prey items and that absolute size of preferred prey increased during larval ontogeny. However, preferred copepod size in relation to larval length differed markedly between <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> and sandeel. In <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> the relative size of the prey declined during growth of the larvae while for sandeel the relative size of prey remained constant at a level of 2. 7 % of larval length. This led to a reduction in prey niche overlap between the two <b>species</b> as <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> and sandeel larvae increased in size. The available prey copepod biomass differed distinctly across the shelf area. In May, <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> prey density was highest in the off-shelf area in Davis Strait. In June and July, the prey rich areas for both species were mainly located on the slopes of the banks and at the shelf break area. In these areas gut fullness was higher than in neighbouring areas, suggesting that the food resource could be scarce. The feeding ecology of <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> and sandeel could explain why larval abundance indices for the two species historically have shown opposite responses to annual environmental conditions and total zooplankton occurrence. Drift and growth of <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> from eggs throughout the pelagic larval stage was tracked from sub-population spawning areas in Davis Strait, Baffin Bay, East Greenland and West Iceland by combing drift- and individual-based egg and larval temperature dependent growth models. Model results were compared to survey results and the settling process was followed at Store Hellefisk Bank in West Greenland. The aim of this study was to evaluate spatio-temporal distribution of small first feeding and large settling larvae, and the between metapopulations. Results showed that egg and larvae can drift for long distances and that the exchange of individuals among the geographically-separated sub-populations could be important for metapopulation dynamics. Larvae from the spawning area in Davis Strait were primarily (> 60 %) transported to Canadian waters. Only larvae from the eastern part of the spawning area in Davis Strait remained in West Greenland. All larvae from the East Greenland spawning area were transported south of Cape Farewell and to West Greenlandic (82 %) or Canadian (18 %) waters. From the West Icelandic spawning areas larvae either, depending on the spatial location on the emergence first feeding larvae, drifted to East Greenland (45 - 53 %), West Greenland (19 − 34 %) or Northern Iceland (21 − 28 %) or remained (> 98 %) in Iceland waters. In Baffin Bay low water temperatures resulted in very slow development rates and eggs probably never hatched. The surveys showed that in West Greenland larvae settling started in August and continued in September but the settling peak period could not be determined. The study in the two areas of Hellefisk Bank showed that juveniles of age 1 and 2 + almost exclusively occurred in one area while the 0 -group was equally distributed in both areas. In the area of high juvenile age 1 and 2 + abundance the condition and stomach fullness was significantly higher than in the low abundance areas. Nursery ground processes within the first year clearly restricted the successful nursery area to a more specific bottom habitat types. The concentrating of juveniles into specific nursery areas implies that juvenile densities may approach the carrying capacity of their habitats in years when settlement is high, which would dampen the annual variability in year class strength of <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut...</b>|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} issues facing developing Arctic fisheries {{is a lack of}} scientific knowledge available to inform management. This thesis develops two key ideas essential to establishing a sustainable harvest of <b>Greenland</b> <b>Halibut</b> (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) within Scott Inlet, Baffin Island: inshore/offshore connectivity of <b>Greenland</b> <b>Halibut</b> stocks, and capture induced stress of <b>Greenland</b> <b>Halibut</b> and <b>Greenland</b> Shark (Somniosus microcephalus).

40|$|A {{total of}} 7244 <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, Walbaum) were tagged in Greenland waters between 1986 and 1998 to {{increase}} information on stock delineations, to clarify migration routes, and {{to describe the}} seasonal movements of fjord populations. At present 517 recaptured <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> have been recorded. For <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> released in Davis Strait, Baffin Bay, and the fjords of southwestern and eastern Greenland, {{a substantial portion of}} recovered fish demonstrated migratory behavior, up to 2500 km, primarily to Denmark Strait between Greenland and Iceland. The recaptured fish provided evidence of intermingling between the population in Denmark Strait and the populations in Davis Strait and the southwest Greenland fjords. These observations support those of other studies that indicate that <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> inhabiting Davis Strait and the fjords of southwestern and eastern Greenland originate in the spawning grounds west of Iceland. The high mobility of offshore <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> within Baffin Bay and Davis Strait suggests that <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> migrate extensively between feeding and spawning areas. <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> in the fjords of northwestern Greenland appear to be resident in behavior and do not intermingle with offshore or more southerly inshore populations.

40|$|Knowledge of diet is {{fundamental}} to studies of seal ecology and especially to any understanding of their role as predators in the northwest Atlantic marine ecosystem. Hooded seals (Cyostophora cristata) {{are one of the}} largest of the northern phocids and are abundant in the north Atlantic and Arctic seas, but very little quantitative data is available on their feeding behaviour and dietary preferences. The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the diet of hooded seals in Newfoundland waters. [...] Otoliths of six common prey species, determined from a previous study on diet of hooded seals, were used to determine fish length / weight - otolith length / height regressions. For all <b>species</b> except <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut,</b> the strongest correlations between otolith size and fish length / weight were established using maximum otolith length. For <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut,</b> maximum otolith height gave a better correlation with fish length and weight. Least squares linear equations were used to derive fish length for Arctic cod, Atlantic herring and capelin, while second order polynomial models were used for <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut,</b> redfish spp., and Atlantic cod. Fish weight estimates were derived using power (log - log) models for all six fish species. [...] Stomach contents of 67 hooded seals collected from inshore and offshore waters off Newfoundland were examined to determine the types of prey eaten by hooded seals. The majority of stomachs (73 %) came from the nearshore region along the northeast coast of Newfoundland and were taken in April. Over half of the samples collected were female (64. 2 %). [...] Fourteen prey groups were identified in stomachs (10 fish, 4 invertebrate). The relative importance of prey, expressed as the percent total wet weight of prey recovered, indicated that <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) was the most important species, followed in order of importance by redfish (Sebastes spp.), Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida), Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), squid (Gonatus spp.), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and capelin (Mallotus villosus). [...] Using otoliths from a previous study and from this study, lengths and weights of fish were estimated from a total of 72 stomachs. Hooded seals fed mainly on fish of 25 - 35 cm length for the larger species, and 15 - 25 cm for the smaller ones. Fish consumed by seals caught incidentally from offshore trawlers were larger than those taken elsewhere. The estimated lengths, and proportions (% weight) of fish found per stomach did not differ significantly between male and female hooded seals. [...] The proportions (percent weight) of redfish and Atlantic herring consumed by hooded seals were significantly larger in the summer months, whereas a higher proportion of Arctic cod was consumed in the winter months. No seasonal differences were found in actual lengths of fish eaten. [...] Total energetic values for fish eaten were calculated from estimated wet weights and energy densitites (kJ/g). <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut,</b> Atlantic herring and Atlantic cod had the highest average energetic values (kJ), followed by redfish, Arctic cod, capelin and squid. Relative contributions of prey, expressed as the percent total energy of prey recovered, showed that <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> contributed approximately 53 % of the total energy consumed, followed by redfish, Atlantic herring, Arctic cod, squid, Atlantic cod and capelin. These proportions corresponded with those obtained from percent total wet weight of prey recovered. [...] The relative abundance of the fish species has a strong influence on the composition of the food in the diet of seals. Hooded seals spend some time in areas that are exploited by commercial fisheries, and consume commercial fish species of commercial size. However, in order to evaluate the impact of local predation on individual fish stocks, more information on behavioural and physiological characteristics of seals and fish are needed...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from December 16, 2015 - June 15, 2016 When adult spawning and juvenile settling locations of marine fishes are geographically separated, their early life history stages must rely on transport and their own behavior to move them toward suitable habitats for successful recruitment to the juvenile phase. Variations in climate may reduce the availability of spawning and juvenile nursery habitats and alter ocean circulation patterns, which can disrupt dispersal pathways and affect life cycle closure. This research focused on two commercially- and ecologically-important flatfish species in the eastern Bering Sea (EBS), <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis), which may be especially sensitive to climate variability due to strong seasonally and ontogenetically variable distributions and extended pelagic larval phases. Data from fishery-dependent and fishery-independent sources were analyzed to {{determine the influence of}} environmental variability on adult habitat use, thus gaining a uniquely comprehensive range of seasonal and geographic coverage of each species' distribution. Transport along and across the Bering Slope was characterized from 23 years (1982 - 2004) of simulations from a Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) ocean circulation model, with the expectation that changes in the strength and position of the Bering Slope Current (BSC) would affect recruitment, and that circulation features along and across the shelf edge would be strongly influenced by atmospheric forcing. To understand the physical mechanisms of larval delivery to shelf nursery areas, <b>Greenland</b> and Pacific <b>halibut</b> dispersal pathways were simulated from their source (e. g., spawning areas over the continental slope) to settlement locations (e. g., juvenile nursery areas on the continental shelf) using DisMELS (Dispersal Model for Early Life Stages), an individual-based particle-tracking model. Spatial patterns of dispersal were characterized for each species and for years with contrasting settlement success to understand the influence of local oceanographic and atmospheric conditions on dispersal corridor use. Adult <b>Greenland</b> and Pacific <b>halibut</b> exhibited strong and contrasting responses to changes in temperature on the shelf, with catches decreasing and increasing, respectively, at approximately 1 °C. The effect of temperature was not as prominent along the slope, suggesting that slope habitats may provide some insulation from shelf-associated environmental variability, particularly for <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut.</b> With warming, <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> exhibited more of a bathymetric shift in distribution, while the shift was more latitudinal for Pacific halibut. Habitat partitioning may, in part, explain differences in <b>Greenland</b> and Pacific <b>halibut</b> adult distributions. Analysis of modeled circulation revealed strong variations in the strength and position of the BSC, with changes in along-shelf and cross-shelf flow associated with changes in recruitment. <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> benefitted from decreased along-shelf and on-shelf flow, while Pacific halibut benefitted from on-shelf flows through Bering and Pribilof canyons. Variability in transport and the BSC position was strongly influenced by winds, ice cover, and large-scale climatic drivers. <b>Greenland</b> and Pacific <b>halibut</b> dispersal pathways varied between years, with distinct differences in dispersal characteristics found between the two <b>species.</b> In general, <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> connected to shelf nursery areas via more northern corridors, while Pacific halibut connected through more southern ones. In years with poor settlement success, the reverse pattern was observed. <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> dispersal metrics were strongly correlated with along- and cross-shelf transport, as well as NW along-shelf winds and ice, while Pacific halibut had strong associations with SW onshelf winds. Spawning time and location, along with climate-induced changes in circulation, appear to differentially affect <b>Greenland</b> and Pacific <b>halibut</b> dispersal pathways, which can lead to variations in their recruitment. Overall, <b>Greenland</b> and Pacific <b>halibut</b> had contrasting responses to similar environmental forcing, and predicted climate change is expected to impact these species in different ways. With increasing warming on the EBS shelf, they will likely further partition their habitats, with <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> finding colder refuges along the slope and Pacific halibut inhabiting larger portions of the shelf. Climate-induced changes in circulation were found to affect the transport of halibut eggs and larvae and their recruitment to the juvenile phase, which suggests an important role in their slope-shelf connectivity. Results {{of this study suggest that}} <b>Greenland</b> and Pacific <b>halibut</b> use different mechanisms to move from their spawning locations along the slope to their settlement areas on the shelf, and that environmental conditions that increase slope-shelf connectivity for one species will likely result in reduced connectivity for the other. This research improves our understanding of how slopespawning flatfish respond to a changing ocean environment, which is important for effective management of their populations, as predicted climate change will likely alter their habitat use and population dynamics...|$|R

Based on the results, it can conclude that Spanish fleet had six different fisheries in the period 2005 - 2011 in NAFO Division 3 LMNO depending on the target species, area, depth and gear (mesh size). The Spanish fisheries were the following: 1) In Divisions 3 LMNO at more than 600 meters depth with demersal 130 mm mesh size gear with <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> (86 %) as target species and the roughhead grenadier (4 %) and the redfish (2 %) as main by-catch species. 2) In Divisions 3 LMNO, mainly in Div 3 O and 3 M with demersal 130 mm mesh size gear in the 200 - 600 strata. The target species was the redfish (80 %) and the main by-catch <b>species</b> were <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> (4 %), American plaice (4 %), cod (3 %) and witch flounder (3 %). 3) In Divisions 3 NO with demersal 130 mm mesh size at depth less than 200 meters. This is a mix fishery with different catch composition in Div. 3 N (56 % American plaice, 26 % yellowtail flounder, 10 % cod and 6 % skates) than in Div. 3 O (57 % redfish, 14 % American plaice, 12 % skates and 7 % witch flounder). 4) In Divisions 3 NO with 280 mm mesh size at less than 200 meters depth. The target species was the skates (63 %) with American plaice (19 %), yellowtail flounder (10 %) and cod (6 %) as main by-catch species. 5) In Division 3 LM with 40 mm mesh size at depth between 300 - 500 meters. The target species of this fishery was the shrimp with 98 % of the catches and only a 2 % of redfish as by-catch. 6) In Division 3 M at depth between 150 - 550 meters targeting cod with 130 mm mesh size gear. The target species of this fishery was cod (92 %) and the most important species in the by catch was redfish (7 %) ...|$|R

40|$|Bortom trawl {{data from}} the depth {{interval}} 300 - 2050 m on the slope off Norway were analysed to study distribution of fish biomass and the associated species assemblages. It is hypothesised that the pronounced hydrographic front between the warm Atlantic Waterrnass and the cold Norwegian Sea Deep-water, combined with a declining food supply with depth and distance from the shelf, structure the assemblages on the continental slope of the eastem Nmwegian Sea. From a high level at the shelf edge and upper slope, the fish biomass declined abruptly at about 720 m when crossing the 0 "C-isotherm associated with the hydrographic front. Beneath the frontal zone, the fish biornass was only 11 % of that above it and decreased further with increasing depth. In upper slope waters, the fish biornass increased with increasing latitude. Arctic species such as Lycodes frigidus and Paraliparis bathybius were dominant in the deep cold slope waters. The high fish biomass associated with the steep temperature gradient at 600 - 720 m was rnainly attributable to a few large and/or abundant boreo-arctic <b>species,</b> i. e. <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, redfishes Sebastes mentella and S. marinus, roughhead grenadier Macrourus berglax, and Raja hyperborea.

The eggs in the ovary of ripening females were large (about 4 mm), transparent, almost equal in size and stuck to the walls of the ovary.

40|$|Results of {{stratified}} {{bottom trawl}} surveys in the Svalbard area {{during the period}} 1983 - 1985 show that depth distribution of <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> is size dependent. Higher proportions of large fish are found in deeper strata. The species exhibits geographically heterogeneous length distributions with a relatively high proportion of small fish north of 76 °K. This inter-area heterogeneity {{could be attributed to}} a southwards migration of larger fish from nursery grounds in the north. Recaptures of fish tagged in the northern area supports this view in that fish not recaptured in the release area had moved southward.

40|$|<b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, (Walbaum)) are {{distributed}} throughout the Canadian Northwest Atlantic from Baffin Bank to the northern Grand Bank and into the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Larger older fish are found in deeper waters than the smaller fish and are more abundant in the more northerly areas. Analysis of growth rates indicated that the largest size at age for <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> is in the Gulf of St. Lawrence with the smallest size at age associated with Baffin Bank. Average sizes at age for intervening areas were generally similar. Probit analysis on female maturity indicated that fish in the Gulf of St. Lawrence mature at a much smaller size than other areas. In the Labrador area size at 50 % maturity decreased progressively moving northward. Fish fecundity was also {{found to be significantly}} higher for the same size fish in the Gulf of St. Lawrence compared with those of southern Labrador area size at 50 % maturity decreased progressively moving northward.

40|$|Graduation date: 2010 <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) have {{decreased}} {{in the eastern}} Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands since the 1970 s. The reasons behind the poor recruitment are unknown, and important knowledge gaps of {{the ecology of the}} early life stages have been identified. The objectives of thesis research were (1) to examine geographic distributions and drift pathways from egg to settled juveniles (age- 1) by a retrospective analysis in order to understand connectivity and different habitat utilization through ontogeny, (2) to describe vertical egg distribution using a one-dimensional model in order to understand patterns of vertical egg distribution and their association with water column hydrography and currents through the egg developmental stages, (3) to investigate diet of <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> larvae and pelagic juveniles diet using stomach content in order to understand foraging behavior, and (4) to examine otolith microstructure of <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> larvae and pelagic juveniles using otolith analysis in order to establish aging guidelines and other features related to bio-ecological changes (e. g. hatching, mouth opening etc.). The results of the thesis indicate that <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> early life stages from eggs to newly settled juveniles have a long duration in the plankton and are subject to extended drift pathways. In the eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> spawn along the continental slope between Akun Island and the Pribilof Islands, and between Umnak Island and Akun Island in the Aleutian Islands. Spawning most likely occurs in winter from December to January. At-sea observations of egg density ranged from 1023. 5 kg/m³ to 1027. 8 kg/m³. Based on modeling results, variability of egg density would affect vertical egg distributions. Eggs were found between 50 m and 400 m, in particular, most eggs were concentrated between 200 m and 300 m. Hatching probably occurs in deep water, below 500 m, and larvae rapidly rise in the water column to depths above 45 m. The mechanisms of slope-shelf connectivity appear {{to be related to the}} Bering Slope Current in the vicinity of both Bering and Pribilof Canyons. Some larvae cross to the continental shelf from March to May through Bering Canyon, while others are transported through Pribilof Canyon. Pelagic juveniles are mostly found around the Pribilof Islands over the middle shelf (50 m - 100 m isobaths) in July, and settling likely occurs during late summer on the middle shelf near St. Matthew Island. However, given that age- 1 juveniles were primarily found on the outer shelf, juvenile <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> appear to actively move to deeper water, presumably selecting appropriate habitat based on a suite of environmental factors after settlement. <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> larvae and pelagic juveniles are vigorous carnivores and their feeding habits change as they grow. The clearly defined rings observed in the otoliths might be biological transition marks. This study shows that <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> have extensive horizontal ontogenetic migrations in the Bering Sea, and utilize a range of geographic areas over the Bering slope and shelf at different life history stages. Based on these results, it is hypothesized that settlement success and recruitment of <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut</b> may be influenced by variability in currents and flows of the Bering Sea slope and shelf during their transport and by size variations of suitable nursery locations...|$|R
50|$|Fishes of {{the area}} include Arctic char, <b>Greenland</b> <b>halibut,</b> polar cod, cuttlefish, wolf fish, sea {{scorpion}} and Greenland shark. Aquatic mammals are dominated by seals (ringed, hooded, harbor, bearded and harp seal) which feed on fish in winter (mostly polar cod) and crustaceans in summer. Larger species include Atlantic walrus, narwhal and sometimes beluga whale. Atlantic walrus feeds on mussels, fish and ringed seals that urges ringed seals to disappear from the area when walruses stay there for prolonged periods.

40|$|It is now {{considered}} important to monitor the fecundity of fish stocks as this provides an indi-cation of the Stock Reproductive Potential (SRP).
