In the United Kingdom the song was featured in series 2 of the BBC television series Gavin and Stacey. An alternative version of the song is played in the British film Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging, in a scene where the main character Georgia is dressed as a <b>stuffed</b> <b>olive.</b> It has also been used in LACVERT's commercial for their lipstick, Ice Kiss, featuring the Olympic gold medalist Kim Yuna. The Stubborn skit in Gag Concert uses the song too.|$|E
50|$|Out of work, Woody is weary {{from looking}} for a place to rent, and he {{complains}} about his not having any living quarters. He is then approached by city slicker Buck Beaver, who convinces him to buy some magic beans. Woody plants them, and a beanstalk shoots up to the clouds. An elevator takes Woody to a giant's castle, where he finds the dopey giant asleep and initially fails to wake him up. Woody puts mustard, red pepper and horseradish on his tongue, which does the trick. Woody hides from the giant in a <b>stuffed</b> <b>olive</b> and is almost swallowed until he uses a car jack to get out before smacking the giant with a fire shovel, throwing a banana peel, and setting the giant's toes on fire.|$|E

50|$|In Puerto Rican cuisine, sofrito {{is mostly}} used when cooking rice dishes, sauces, and soups. Sofrito {{is closely related}} to recaíto. The two main {{ingredients}} that give Puerto Rican sofrito its characteristic flavor are recao (culantro) and ají dulce, but red and green cubanelle peppers, red bell peppers, pimientos, yellow onions, garlic, plum tomatoes, and cilantro are also added. All red peppers are roasted, seeded, and then added to the sofrito. Sofrito is traditionally cooked with olive oil or annatto oil, tocino (bacon), salted pork and cured ham.

Juanita's best friends, Mrs. Dyer and Mrs. Dashaway, passed large dinner plates, each with a spoon, a fork, and a coffee cup without saucer. They apologized and discussed the afternoon's game as they passed through the thicket of women's feet. Then they distributed hot buttered rolls, coffee poured from an enamel-ware pot, <b>stuffed</b> <b>olives,</b> potato salad, and angel's-food cake. There was, {{even in the most}} strictly conforming Gopher Prairie circles, a certain option as to collations. The olives need not be stuffed. Doughnuts were in some houses well thought of as a substitute for the hot buttered rolls. But there was in all the town no heretic save Carol who omitted angel's-food.|$|R

50|$|Historically, Aghribs {{was well}} known for its Monday market. For over a hundred years, the market {{was a place where}} {{thousands}} of economic transactions were carried out every Monday by people who would come from all over Kabylie. The main activities included buying and selling animals (cows, oxen, sheep, donkeys,...), food <b>stuffs</b> (cereals, <b>olive</b> oil, spices, meat,...), agricultural tools, and so forth. However, in recent years, the market has shrunk markedly and is no longer the strong economic driver it once was.|$|R

40|$|We {{live in a}} time {{in which}} the laws of the market can appear all- conquering, in which the {{principles}} of liberal economic theory are becoming applied to an ever widening sphere of processes, to the extent that, for some theorists, even our identities become implicated, as the individual becomes conceptualised not only as the producer and consumer of goods and services, but as ‘the entrepreneur of himself or herself’ (Gordon 1991 : 44). The marketplace however, seems to hark back to a different time, in which ‘The Global’ had little meaning; when the supply of fresh produce depended on the season and not international freight networks; and where the supply-chains linking producer and vendor were short, if not non-existent. And yet in the UK, the marketplace is undergoing a resurgence. Farmer’s markets, where producers sell direct to customers, have led the way; whereas none existed in 1997, by 2003 450 had been established in England (DEFRA 2003 : 79; Bullock 2000 : 4). There has also been an explosion in what might be termed the urban ‘gourmet market’. Borough Market in London, for example, historically a wholesale fruit and vegetable market selling to traders and restaurateurs, has been hugely successful since it started a gourmet market at weekends in 1999. And the Northcote Road market in South London, which will be the focus of this paper, has evolved from a market on the verge of closure in the mid- 1990 s, to an increasingly successful market in which apparently wealthy customers can pick up everything from fruit and vegetables, to artisan baked breads, <b>stuffed</b> <b>olives</b> and pashminas. ...|$|R

60|$|Then {{there was}} no more to do but to prepare for the picnic. They chose a grassy plot {{in the shadow of a}} half-dismantled bark-lodge,--a relic of the Indians, who resort to the place every summer. In the ashes of that sylvan hearth they kindled their fire, Mr. Arbuton {{gathering}} the sticks, and the colonel showing a peculiar genius in adapting the savage flames to the limitations of the civilized coffee-pot borrowed of Mrs. Gray. Mrs. Ellison laid the cloth, much meditating the arrangement of the viands, and reversing again and again the relative positions of the sliced tongue and the sardines that flanked the cold roast chicken, and doubting dreadfully whether to put down the cake and the canned peaches at once, or reserve them for a second course; the <b>stuffed</b> <b>olives</b> drove her to despair, being in a bottle, and refusing to be balanced by anything less monumental in shape. Some wild asters and red leaves and green and yellowing sprays of fern which Kitty arranged in a tumbler were hailed with rapture, but presently flung far away with fierce disdain because they had ants on them. Kitty witnessed this outburst with her usual complacency, and then went on making the coffee. With such blissful pain as none but lovers know, Mr. Arbuton saw her break the egg upon the edge of the coffee-pot, and let it drop therein, and then, with a charming frenzy, stir it round and round. It was a picture of domestic suggestion, a subtle insinuation of home, the unconscious appeal of inherent housewifery to inherent husbandhood. At the crash of the eggshell he trembled; the swift agitation of the coffee and the egg within the pot made him dizzy.|$|R
50|$|Fire on Dawson’s style had {{usually been}} {{described}} as alternative rock or post grunge with progressive influences rather than all out progressive rock up till the release of 7 Billion and a Nameless Somebody. Upon {{the release of the}} band's debut album 'Prognative', Sonntag stated in an interview “That’s always been the case I guess. The alternative guys have been saying we are too experimental whereas for the progressive fans we were too mainstream. But these things have never really bothered us. We want to explore the whole spectrum and that allows us to put <b>stuff</b> like <b>Olives</b> and Won by One on the same album without any apprehension”. Their second album is, however, widely acknowledged as being more progressive and experimental in nature with subtle jazz elements and multi-rhythmic undertones laced across the piece.|$|R
5000|$|Zeytinyağlı yaprak sarması (<b>stuffed</b> leafs with <b>olive</b> oil) is the sarma {{made with}} vine leaves stuffed with a rice-spice mixture and cooked with olive oil. This type of dolma {{does not contain}} meat, is served cold and also {{referred}} to as sarma, which means [...] "wrapping" [...] in Turkish. Dried fruit such as blackcurant; raisins, figs or cherries and cinnamon and allspice used to be added into the mixture to sweeten zeytinyağlı dolma in Ottoman cuisine. Vine leaves (yaprak) could be filled not only with rice and spices but also with meat and rice, etli yaprak sarma, in which case it was often served hot with yogurt. The word sarma is also used for some types of desserts, such as fıstık sarma (wrapped pistachio).|$|R
5000|$|Vegimals, the company's initial product, were velour and fur-covered {{vegetables}} and fruits, some with Velcro fastenings, which had embroidered faces.

Non-vegetable, non-fruit characters included an egg that unzipped to release a stuffed fried egg, a zippered can containing four Velcro-attached sardines, animals such as a fish inside a fish inside another fish, a whale with a baby inside, a mother sheep with lamb, and [...] "Emile Bearhart" [...] with a pocket containing a red velour heart, and also an 11-inch velour pyramid containing a blue velour mummy.

40|$|Alginate {{is a type}} of {{polysaccharide}} {{that occurs}} naturally in all brown algae as a skeletal component of their cell walls. Alginate is used in food because it is a powerful thickening, stabilizing, and gel-forming agent. Some foods that may include alginate are ice cream, fruit-fi lled snacks, salad dressings, pudding, onion rings, and even the pimento strips that are <b>stuffed</b> into green <b>olives.</b> Most alginate used in foods {{is in the form of}} sodium alginate. In order to form a gel, sodium alginate needs to come into contact with divalent ions such as calcium (Ca 2 +). As soon as sodium alginate (Figure 1) is added to a solution of calcium chloride, a gel forms as the sodium ions (Na+) are exchanged with calcium ions (Ca 2 +) and the polymers become crosslinked (Figure 2). The calcium ions are able to crosslink the alginate polymers because they can form two bonds, as opposed to monovalent ions such as sodium, which can only form one bond. The longer the alginate is in contact with the calcium chloride solution, the more rigid the gel will become, as more crosslinks are formed. Also, depending on the concentration of calcium ions, the gels are either thermoreversible (low concentrations) or not (high concentrations) ...|$|R

It is well to remember the many personal sacrifices and the endless long hours work­ing like a human dynamo, striving to improve the living standards of the worker and his family; putting more bread and butter on their table and, needless to say, the betterment of our community as a whole can be attributed to his interest in civic activities. He gave of himself so completely he ruined his own health. W are all better off be­cause of the principles he stands for and lives by. Among his many achievements in labor and public life and the many worthwhile things he founded, the following serve as living proof of Gosser's untiring efforts. The Childrens Summer Camp, The Diagnostic Clinic, The Health and Retiree Center with the Pharmacies, the Optical Department, the Dental Department, the Hearing Aid Department, United Labor Committee, 60 Now, Council of Elders, Golden Age Summer and Winter Centers. As President of Local 12 U. A. W., as Regional Director of Region 2 -B, U. A. W., as. Vice-president of the International Union, UAW-AFL-CIO, during which time he was Director of the Competitive Shops Department, Director of Skilled Trades Department, Director of Wage and Hours Department, Director of Die Casting Department, Director of Auto-Lite Department, Director of Dana-Spicer Department, Director of Champion Spark Plug Department, Director of Doehler-Jarvis Council, Director of Foundry Department and Director of several other wage and hour councils too numerous to mention. In civic life he served as a Charter Member of the Labor-Management-Citizens Com­mittee and the Toledo Industrial Development Committee. Dick Gosser also was an in­tegral part of the Toledo Port Authority and other civic committees. He helped in various major fund raising drives like the Newsboy Goodfellows, The Community Chest, hospi­tals, churches, and others. Only last year, through his efforts, every needy child had an opportunity to attend free the Children's Wonderland at the Lucas County Recreational Center. These are just an example of the many'ways Toledo's most renowned labor leader has helped people in all walks of life throughout the United States an. dCanada.. It is fitting this evening that over 2, 000 of us. gather together to break bread with this great man and our best 'friend, Richard T. Gosser. It is ·our way of demonstrati. ng to him and to everyone that we honor and appreciate his complete dedication to labor and the community. What's more, we publicly ackqowledge and respect his honesty, his courage, his leadership, and his efforts to obtain a fuller measure of life for all•. We sincerely' hope that his retirement as an active officer in the labor movement is not a conclusion to 'an illustrious past, but instead with the Good Lord willing and his health permitting, Dick Gosser will continue to be an inspiration and a guiding tower of light to a better and brighter future. In these troubled tiines, now more than ever, we need his unequaled quality of under­standing tolerance, perseverance, desire and ability to help people gain dignity as be­comes the brotherhood of man. 'I am deeply touched by this turnout tonite. I don't believe anyone came out here because they want a job as an international representative. My influence with the UAW has diminished since my retirement so I take it that those who are here are my friends. And I {{want to thank you for}} giving up your favorite TV program or breaking a bowling date or some other engagement to come. If I seem to be overwhelmed by gratitude [...] forgive me. During my long years as a Labor Leader I have found gratitude isn't our chief virtue. I can think back to a long list of associates whom I have tried to help and who are no longer with meÿoing back to Toots Martinÿ [...] But I don't think this is the place or the time to review history [...] , or to talk of my deeds or my misdeeds. After all the words that have been spoken it would be like putting more icing on the frosting of the cake. Looking back 30 years I would say we have come a pretty long way in getting a better deal for the worker. Now if we can mobilize only a small part of that spirit when we first started this industrial union movement; if we can get just a small part of the effort and the sacrifice that those fellows gave, we can gain more in the next 30 months than has been accomplished in the last 30 years. I donlt plan to make a long speech [...] , that is, long for me. But last week I told some negro ministers who met with me that thereWs a difference when a worker in a factory retires and a fellow who has made his living using his brains and his wits. If the last couple of months in Florida proved anything to me it proved I wasnlt going to be happy spending the rest of my life sunning myself on a rocking chair. If I can't do all I could 5 or i 0 years ago I still can outthink [...] and figure out a few short cuts to help the workers [...] . or the retirees. And having been doing this so long, I may as well go on doing it. But nowadays itls not the worker that needs help so much as the fellows that have given up workingo [...] or the young fellows that want to work but can't [...] . and they canlt because there is no job to be found for too many of them. Yet there is one simple remedy that can help both these groups of people [...] . the young fellow looking for a job and the old-timer who has given his up. That is our Sixty Now program where we make it possible for the older worker to retire with a decent pay check so he can enjoy life and live in dignity. While we are helping him to a well-earned and long deserved rest we are helping create a job opening for the younger fellow just out of school. Let me just give you a few facts before I leave this point. The Social Security Department reports that the average monthly benefit to the 13 million people retired under this law is 76. 66. That is less than i, 000. 00 a year. If the President and the Congress really want to cure poverty herels a swell place to begin. LetWs raise Social Security [...] . and if we have to reduce anything, letts reduce the age [...] . NOT the Social Security benefit. The 1960 census report says there were nearly 3 and 3 / 4 million men and women between the ages of 60 and 64 working in this country. At the same time the United States Labor Department reported there were between 4 and 5 million persons unemployed. If we could make it possible and worthwhiled for these older persons to retire on a decent benefit it would nearly take care of all the unemployed. Now just let me make a final point. No one has to tell me that not all these young fellows have the skills or the aptitudes to take over all these jobs. So I would like to recommend to our school and university officials; to [...] 2 - our legislators in Congress, in the State, to the county commissioners and to the City Council that they find the money to make available the facilities needed for training. I think you would find the employers, the unions and the public willing to do their part and carry their share. It would mean that the present vocational facilities at Macomber and the University of Toledo would have to be expanded° I read that school officials in 5 counties in this area have gotten together to open a vocational school at the Rossford Erie Depot. What would be wrong with the employers forming a joint committee with the teachers and the labor unions and making up a flexible training program so these youngsters could be able to fill all the openings in the plants and elsewhere. And why not follow a program such as the UAW skilled trades which I directed combining training in the school with that on the job. I would recommend that once a fellow signs up for this training he has to finish the course and can't bid on some higher paid opening which might come up while hews learning. The youngsters today have to learn that it's not the quick or easy buck that counts but the ability and willingness to learn skills or trades that will stick with him a lifetime and give him the chance to get a job anytime, any place while the untrained worker is automated out of a livelihood. I could go on for a lot more but I think these points are important. I am willing to help in this in any way I can [...] . up to the limits of my resources. In closing I think I should say I deeply appreciate your coming and the sentiments that were expressed. I want to assure everyone that I shall continue to make any contribution I can to help people so long as I can draw a breath [...] - 3 -...|$|R
