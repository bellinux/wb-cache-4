5|$|A {{growing number}} of people, among them Captain William Rooke Creswell, the {{director}} of the Commonwealth Naval Forces, demanded an autonomous Australian navy, financed and controlled by Australia. In 1907 Prime Minister Alfred Deakin and Creswell, while attending the Imperial Conference in London, sought the British Government's agreement to end the <b>subsidy</b> <b>system</b> and develop an Australian navy. The Admiralty rejected and resented the challenge, but suggested diplomatically that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient. Deakin was not impressed with the Admiralty, and in 1908 invited the United States Great White Fleet to visit Australia. The visit prompted public enthusiasm for a modern navy and led to the order of two 700-ton s, a purchase that angered the British. The surge in German naval construction in 1909 led the Australian admiralty to change its position on an Australian navy, which resulted in the Naval Defence Act of 1910 being passed which created the Australian navy.|$|E

5|$|During {{the second}} phase, {{starting}} in June 2012, {{half of the}} funds from energy and food subsidies will be re-allocated {{to the people and}} the remaining 50% will go to the industrial sector. If approved by the Parliament, the government will pay an extra cash handout of 280,000 rials/month to 80% of the general population (i.e. people earning less than $2000/month, which is a comfortable income level in Iran). In July 2012, it was announced that implementation of the second phase was suspended awaiting further adjustments by the government and because of raising inflation (around 22% as of April 2012). Finally, in fall 2013, the parliament approved a plan to drop 22 million Iranians—the top 30 percent of earners—from the <b>subsidy</b> <b>system</b> instead. Yet, it was reported in 2014 that out of Iran’s population of 77 million, 73.6 million registered to receive the cash hand-outs.|$|E

40|$|Many {{firms and}} {{organizations}} compete for customers {{while at the}} same time receiving substantial funding from outside sources, such as government subsidies. In this paper, we study the effects of two commonly observed, alternative <b>subsidy</b> <b>systems</b> on the behavior of price-competing firms. Specifically, we compare an open-ended per-unit price subsidy with a closed-ended subsidy, allocated according to the firms’ market shares. We find that, holding the total subsidy budget constant, the open-ended subsidy results in fiercer price competition, lower prices, higher output, and lower profits than the closed-ended, market-share based alternative. Second, the open system yields higher overall welfare for relatively modest subsidies and limited substitutability between goods; the closed system performs better at relatively high subsidy levels and when goods are closer substitutes. Third, a market-share based subsidy makes collusive behavior between firms much harder. Our results, therefore, suggest a potential trade-off between short-run and long-run objectives: subsidies designed to widen participation may stimulate collusive behavior. These findings may have important policy implications for the design of <b>subsidy</b> <b>systems</b> in, among many others, education and the arts.

In the short term these subsidies are helping to ease the burden but they cannot keep rising indefinitely, {{and sooner or later}} the load will have to be shared out. In the short term, national consumption per capita is expected to rise from the current level of 0.4 tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) to as much as 0.90 toe in 2030, a good indication of development, but a massive challenge as well. The input of renewable energy is a matter of particular importance.|$|E
25|$|The Attlee Government placed strong {{emphasis}} on {{improving the quality of}} life in rural areas, benefiting both farmers and other consumers. Security of tenure for farmers was introduced, while consumers were protected by food subsidies and the redistributive effects of deficiency payments. Between 1945-51, the quality of rural life was improved by improvements in gas, electricity, and water services, as well as in leisure and public amenities. In addition, the 1947 Transport Act improved provision of rural bus services, while the Agriculture Act 1947 established a more generous <b>subsidy</b> <b>system</b> for farmers. Legislation was also passed in 1947 and 1948 which established a permanent Agricultural Wages Board to fix minimum wages for agricultural workers.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{simulate}} the effect of spatial thinning on the distribution of non-industrial private forests (NIPFs) and predict the thinning area under different <b>subsidy</b> <b>systems</b> in Hokkaido prefecture, Japan. The simulated thinning area is based on a Geographic Information System (GIS) and an algorithm that considers the stand condition and applicability of different subsidies for conducting thinning. The accuracy of the simulations was checked by comparing observed and predicted thinning area data. In Shimokawa municipality the thinning area was significantly smaller than in Furano municipality, where the rules governing subsidy allocations are more relaxed. The coefficients of determination (R 2), which were calculated by comparing the estimated and observed jointly implemented thinning areas, defined as areas in which thinning occurred in several adjacent subcompartments, were 0. 88 and 0. 89 in Furano and Shimokawa, respectively. Although our algorithm slightly overestimated the jointly implemented thinning area, the estimated average thinning area was within the two-sided 95 % confidence interval for the observed area. By applying the model and linking our simulation results to the GIS, the total potential distribution of jointly implemented thinning area was visualized in two geographic areas that have different <b>subsidy</b> <b>systems.</b> Przemysław Szmi...|$|R
30|$|The Japanese {{government}} subsidises various silvicultural {{practices in}} planted forests {{irrespective of the}} tree species, providing approximately 70 % of the planting, thinning and other silvicultural costs. For this reason, these subsidies were not included as a variable in this study but rather treated as a constant with a value of 70 % of silvicultural costs (Additional file 1 : Table S 1 (b)). The reality of these <b>subsidy</b> <b>systems</b> was confirmed by checking active silvicultural areas throughout Japan and comparing the subsidies they received with the implemented silvicultural practices (Hiroshima and Nakajima 2006).|$|R

500|$|Prior to {{federation}} each {{self-governing colony}} had operated its own naval force. These navies {{were small and}} lacked [...] capabilities, forcing the separate colonies to subsidise {{the cost of a}} British naval squadron in their waters for decades. The colonies maintained control over their respective navies until 1 March 1901, when the Commonwealth Naval Force was created. This new force also lacked blue water capable ships, and ultimately did not lead to a change in Australian naval policy. In 1907 Prime Minister Alfred Deakin and Creswell, while attending the Imperial Conference in London, sought the British Government's agreement to end the <b>subsidy</b> <b>system</b> and develop an Australian navy. The Admiralty rejected and resented the challenge, but suggested diplomatically that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient.

This visit fired public enthusiasm for a modern navy and in part led to the order of two 700-ton [...] destroyers. The surge in German naval construction prompted the Admiralty to change their position however and the Royal Australian Navy was subsequently formed in 1911, absorbing the Commonwealth Naval Force. On 4 October 1913, the new fleet steamed through Sydney Heads, consisting of the battlecruiser , three light cruisers, and three destroyers, while several other ships were still under construction. And as a consequence the navy entered the First World War as a formidable force.|$|E

The model offers new perspectives on the role played by subsidies policy and the structure on which the empirical research is based.
