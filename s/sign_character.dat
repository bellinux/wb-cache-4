50|$|As {{a rule of}} thumb, if a {{character}} or symbol was not already part of a widely used data-processing character set and was also not usually provided on typewriter keyboards for a national language, it did not get in. Hence the directional double quotation marks « and » used for some European languages were included, but not the directional double quotation marks “ and ” used for English and some other languages. French did not get its œ and Œ ligatures because they could be typed as 'oe'. Likewise, Ÿ, needed for all-caps text, was dropped as well. Albeit under different codepoints, these three characters were later reintroduced with ISO/IEC 8859-15 in 1999, which also introduced the new euro <b>sign</b> <b>character</b> €. Likewise Dutch {{did not get the}} ĳ and Ĳ letters, because Dutch speakers had become used to typing these as two letters instead. Romanian did not initially get its Ș/ș and Ț/ț (with comma) letters, because these letters were initially unified with Ş/ş and Ţ/ţ (with cedilla) by the Unicode Consortium, considering the shapes with comma beneath to be glyph variants of the shapes with cedilla. However, the letters with explicit comma below were later added to the Unicode standard and are also in ISO/IEC 8859-16.Most of the ISO/IEC 8859 encodings provide diacritic marks required for various European languages using the Latin script. Others provide non-Latin alphabets: Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, Arabic and Thai. Most of the encodings contain only spacing characters although the Thai, Hebrew, and Arabic ones do also contain combining characters. However, the standard makes no provision for the scripts of East Asian languages (CJK), as their ideographic writing systems require many thousands of code points. Although it uses Latin based characters, Vietnamese does not fit into 96 positions (without using combining diacritics) either. Each Japanese syllabic alphabet (hiragana or katakana, see Kana) would fit, but like several other alphabets of the world they are not encoded in the ISO/IEC 8859 system.|$|E
40|$|We define melonic field {{theories}} {{over the}} $p$-adic numbers {{with the help}} of a <b>sign</b> <b>character.</b> Our construction works over the reals as well as the $p$-adics, and it includes the fermionic and bosonic Klebanov-Tarnopolsky models as special cases; depending on the <b>sign</b> <b>character,</b> the symmetry group of the field theory can be either orthogonal or symplectic. Analysis of the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the two-point function in the leading melonic limit shows that power law scaling behavior in the infrared arises for fermionic theories when the <b>sign</b> <b>character</b> is non-trivial, and for bosonic theories when the <b>sign</b> <b>character</b> is trivial. In certain cases, the Schwinger-Dyson equation can be solved exactly using a quartic polynomial equation, and the solution interpolates between the ultraviolet scaling controlled by the spectral parameter and the universal infrared scaling. As a by-product of our analysis, we see that melonic field theories defined over the real numbers can be modified by replacing the time derivative by a bilocal kinetic term with a continuously variable spectral parameter. The infrared scaling of the resulting two-point function is universal, independent of the spectral parameter of the ultraviolet theory. Comment: 39 pages, 2 figure...|$|E
