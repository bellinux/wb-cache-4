Each of the six factions is unique in their <b>starting</b> <b>equipment,</b> and each faction has a unique victory objective, though the Terran factions are more alike with each other (the same with the other races).|$|E
50|$|When {{the game}} begins, players {{are given a}} brief mission {{statement}} instructing them to lead their party {{into the depths of}} the dungeon in order to find and exterminate a certain foe. Players begin with a randomly generated party, complete with names, character portraits, and <b>starting</b> <b>equipment.</b> Parties range from three to five individuals, and consist of a random selection of clerics, mages, rogues, and warriors. While players are guaranteed to not receive more than two of any given character class, there are no guarantees that the party will be balanced.|$|E
5000|$|All {{cards are}} shuffled {{separately}} {{and placed on}} the appropriately marked spaces on the board. Twelve cards are randomly pulled from the Seventy-two card Plot deck and removed from the game to produce some variation in what plots may occur. Each player selects a corner space of the Career Track to begin on. This is their [...] "Starting Career" [...] and provides them with base modifiers for their stats and, in some cases, some <b>starting</b> <b>equipment.</b> The objective of the players is to develop their character statistics {{to a point that}} they can combat the Minion Plots and prevent them from reaching fruition.|$|E

5000|$|When the Vanguard rocket was {{selected}} as the first orbital launch vehicle for the US, Martin Company got the contract as prime contractor. Given the required thrust levels, the Viking propulsion (the Reaction Motors XLR10) was deemed insufficient, and General Electric proposal, based Hermes program, was considered more fitting and a less risky choice than Reaction Motors next project. [...] Thus, on October 1, 1955 Martin purchase order 55-3516-CP was signed with General Electric for the X-405 engine for furnishing a self-contained unit which was to include the thrust structure, gimbal ring, engine components, and engine <b>starting</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{player can}} choose to play as one of eight {{different}} default character models (four for each side, although Counter-Strike: Condition Zero added two extra models, bringing the total to ten). Players are generally given {{a few seconds before}} the round begins (known as [...] "freeze time") to prepare and buy equipment, during which they cannot attack or move. They can return to the buy area within a set amount of time to buy more equipment (some custom maps included neutral [...] "buy zones" [...] that could be used by both teams). Once the round has ended, surviving players retain their equipment for use in the next round; players who were killed begin the next round with the basic default <b>starting</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E
50|$|Gameplay of Space Engineers {{begins with}} the player {{selecting}} or joining a world with specific settings, such {{as the number of}} asteroids and the available <b>starting</b> <b>equipment.</b> When creating or editing a world, several advanced options are available to change how the player will interact with the world, and how the worlds will appear. This includes changing the speed with which several tools and machines will work, {{and the size of the}} player's inventory. While loading a world, a screen is visible for a while where one of many quotations concerning space, science, and engineering is visible in the center of the screen. There is a collection of quotes from scientists such as Isaac Newton, Galileo Galilei, Albert Einstein, as well as from Arthur C. Clarke's three laws. Once in-game, the player is given control of a single astronaut, which is referred to as a Space Engineer. The player can build a station, large ship, or small ship. Construction begins by choosing any random block which will appear in front of the engineer and can be spawned in to create a new ship with that block used as the starting point for the rest of the structure. Blocks may be structural, functional, interactive, or aesthetic, and may fall into more than one category. Blocks also take up varying amounts of space. In addition to placing blocks, the player can also use tools and weapons. The most important blocks, the armour blocks which make up most of the structure, can be damaged and deformed through collisions or by weapon impacts. Some blocks have attached keypads, which can be used to view and manipulate the status of other specific blocks attached to the structure. To be functionally connected however, and to transport materials, conveyors must be used to connect the desired machines. Functional blocks require power, which can be provided by solar panels or nuclear reactors attached to the same structure. While reactors must be supplied with uranium, and produce large amounts of power while active, solar panels will continually produce a low output of power when there is line-of-sight to the sun. Once being produced, power is automatically distributed throughout the entire structure and can also be stored in batteries.|$|E
50|$|Racetracks are {{primarily}} designed for competition through speed, featuring defined start-finish lines or posts, {{and sometimes even}} a series of defined timing points that divide the track into time sectors. Some sports merely measure endurance, or how long a competitor can race. Racetracks can host individual or team sports. Racetracks can feature rolling starts, or fixed <b>starts,</b> with associated <b>equipment</b> (<b>starting</b> blocks, cages, wheel traps etc.) They invariably feature a pit lane, and usually timing equipment.|$|R

40|$|This study investigates how assistive {{technology}} tools {{are used in}} the classroom by students in reading and writing disabilities in the school years immediately prior to moving to gymnasium. Through observations and interviews with two students and two teachers this study also considers if the use of these tools can lead to increased accessibility and goal fulfilment, and whether these elements are prerequisites for success. The result shows that the students use laptops in the classroom, primarily for writing longer texts, and that in order to be successful, an early <b>start,</b> <b>equipment,</b> time and positive attitudes towards the tools are important. The students use the tools in the classroom, but they have very different feelings about how included they are in the class. The participants see a clear link between the use of {{assistive technology}} tools and increased goal fulfilment. ...|$|R
