However, the decreasing importance of the soda ash trade to ICI in favour of newer products such as paints and plastics, meant that in 1984 the Wallerscote site was closed, and thereafter mostly demolished. The laboratory where polythene was discovered was sold off and the building became home to a variety of businesses including a go-kart track and paintballing, and the Winnington Works were divested to the newly formed company, Brunner Mond, in 1991. It was again sold in 2006, to Tata (an Indian-based company) and in 2011 was re branded as Tata Chemicals Europe.

These objects are commonly stabilised in <b>sodium</b> <b>sesquicarbonate</b> solutions. However, modification of the natural patina and development of active corrosion can occur during these processes, which implies the need for monitoring the stabilization processes. In a {{first part of the}} study, we focussed on examining how corrosion potential measurements can contribute in providing information on these side effects. The electrochemical behaviour of artificial copper and copper alloys (covered or not with corrosion layers) immersed in <b>sodium</b> <b>sesquicarbonate</b> solutions was reported. In addition SR-XRD measurements were performed before and after the treatment to reveal the reactions that take place. A second part involved observing some key reactions in a novel electrochemical cell designed for in-situ, time resolved SR-XRD studies of metal corrosion. By taking simultaneous SR-XRD and electrochemical data on copper electrodes in a <b>sodium</b> <b>sesquicarbonate</b> solution, we observed the replacement of nantokite with cuprite in real time. To investigate the presence of amorphous intermediates in the reaction, the application of the in situ cell was extended to simultaneous XAS experiments. A rising intensity of the XAS signal was observed as a function of time. This behaviour may be caused by the electrolyte solution and/or the window material as both give a clearly visible copper edge. In a last part of the study a variation of the immersion treatment was investigated, involving the application of a low potential to the artefact to drive the chloride extraction process. A complimentary set of electrochemical, microscopy and synchrotron X-ray techniques has been used {{to examine the effects of}} this stabilization method on corroded copper artefacts, where chlorides form a substantial part of the corrosion.

40|$|In the {{experiments}} {{described in this}} study, we make use of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the K-edge of copper for monitoring the surface–solution interface of corroded metals in-situ in a <b>sodium</b> <b>sesquicarbonate</b> solution. We show conclusively that, unlike previously published XRD measurements, the XAS spectra are almost wholly characteristic of the contaminated solution and not the corroded surface, {{in cases where the}} sesquicarbonate is effective at removing chlorides. This is true even when there is only 125 µm of fluid over the sample, which demonstrates that there is very effective absorption of the Cu Kα radiation from the surface by copper in solution. As a function of time we observe a rising intensity in the XANES and EXAFS regions which is accompanied by a proportional increase in the degree of EXAFS modulation. The latter {{is due to the fact}} that a significant proportion of the corrosion product goes into solution, rather than being converted to a stable compound on the surface. Moreover, the spectra show that the local atomic environment of the copper in solution is extremely similar to that in the surface. Overall from both XAS and previously performed XRD data we can conclude that the chlorine containing corrosion products become detached from the surface and go partly into solution, while a thin cuprite layer forms (or is already present at) at the original metal surface...|$|E

The pure material contains 70. 3 % sodium carbonate and by calcination the excess CO 2 and {{water can be}} driven off, yielding natural soda ash. The terms soda ash and sodium carbonate are used interchangeably. Trona calcining is a key process step in production of soda ash (sodium carbonate anhydrate) from the relatively cheap trona ore. The calcination reaction may proceeds in a sequence of steps. Depending on the conditions, it may result in formation of either sodium carbonate monohydrate (Na 2 CO 3 · H 2 O), <b>sodium</b> <b>sesquicarbonate</b> or weigschederite (Na 2 CO 3 · 3 NaHCO 3).

40|$|XANES and EXAFS {{information}} is conventionally measured in transmission through the energy-dependent absorption of X-rays or by observing X-ray fluorescence, but secondary fluorescence processes, {{such as the}} emission of electrons and optical photons (e. g., 200 - 1000 nm), {{can also be used}} as a carrier of the XAS signatures, providing complementary information such as improved surface specificity. Where the near-visible photons have a shorter range in a material, the data will be more surface specific. Moreover, optical radiation may escape more readily than X-rays through liquid in an environmental cell. Here, we describe a first test of optically detected X-ray absorption spectroscopy (ODXAS) for monitoring electrochemical treatments on copper-based alloys, for example, heritage metals. Artificially made corrosion products deposited on a copper substrate were analyzed in air and in a 1 % (w/v) <b>sodium</b> <b>sesquicarbonate</b> solution to simulate typical conservation methods for copper-based objects recovered from marine environments. The measurements were made on stations 7. 1 and 9. 2 MF (SRS Daresbury, UK) using the mobile luminescence end station (MoLES), supplemented by XAS measurements taken on DUBBLE (BM 26 A) at the ESRF. The ODXAS spectra usually contain fine structure similar to that of XAS spectra measured in X-ray fluorescence. Importantly, for the compounds examined, the ODXAS is significantly more surface specific, and > 98 % characteristic of thin surface layers of 0. 5 - 1. 5 -mu m thickness in cases where X-ray measurements are dominated by the substrate. However, EXAFS and XANES from broadband optical measurements are superimposed on a high background due to other optical emission modes. This produces statistical fluctuations up to double what would be expected from normal counting statistics because the data retain the absolute statistical fluctuation in the original raw count, while losing up to 70 % of their magnitude when background is removed. The problem may be solved in future through optical filtering to isolate the information-containing band, combined with the use of higher input X-ray fluxes available on third-generation light sources...|$|E

This should let facilities under 250 TPD meet the small plant guidelines for acid gas control. Various levels of PAC were injected along with the trona. 300 mg/dsm{sup 3 } 7 % O{sub 2 } of PAC provides a comfortable margin between the emissions limitations achieved and both large and small plant regulatory guidelines for tetra- through octachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans [PCDD/F] and mercury when the ESP is operated below 350 F. Bi-fluid nozzles were used to spray finely atomized water between the economizer outlet and ESP inlet to maintain temperatures in the desired 300 - 350 F range. Particulate and metals emissions limitations were met by this 400 ft{sup 2 }/ 1, 000 acft{sup 2 } specific collector area [SCA], 3 -field ESP. Both the water sprays and PAC improved ESP performance.

IDIP offers the potential for simultaneously achieving 90 % SO{sub 2 } removal, and 65 % NO{sub x} removal from a high sulfur flue gas. The process is well suited for new or retrofit applications since it can be incorporated within existing economizer and downstream ductwork. Subscale tests were performed {{in order to identify}} the best calcium and sodium sorbents. These tests involved the injection of calcium hydroxide and sodium sorbents at various points of the flue gas system downstream of a 0. 25 MM BTU/hr. coal fired combustor, and the gas residence times, cooling rates and temperatures were comparable to those found for full-scale utility boilers. These tests verified that a high surface area hydrated lime provides maximum sorbent utilization and identified an alcohol-water hydrated lime as yielding the highest surface area and the best SO{sub 2 } removal capability. The tests also identified sodium bicarbonate to be somewhat more effective than <b>sodium</b> <b>sesquicarbonate</b> for SO{sub 2 } removal. The proof of concept demonstration was conducted on the large combustor at the Riley Stoker Research Facility in Worcester, MA. When economically compared to conventional limestone slurry scrubbing on a 300 MW plant, the dry injection process shows lower capital cost but higher operating cost. Hydrated lime injection can be less costly than limestone scrubbing when two {{or more of the following}} conditions exist: plant is small (less than 100 MW); yearly operating hours are small (less than 3000); and the remaining plant lifetime is small (less than 10 years) ...|$|E
40|$|Corrosion is a {{major source}} of {{degradation}} in heritage metal objects, and any remedial measures are subject to a strong (Western) ethic that favors conservation as opposed to restoration. 0 Accordingly, major scientific challenges exist for developing appropriate treatment methods to stabilize and protect artifacts after they are recovered from an archaeological site, both before and during their display or storage in a museum. Because inappropriate treatments can cause irreversible damage to irreplaceable objects, it is crucial that the chemical processes involved are fully understood and characterized before any preservation work is undertaken. In this regard, large infrastructural facilities such as synchrotrons, neutron sources, and partide accelerators provide a wealth of analytical possibilities, unavailable in smaller scale laboratories. In general, the intensity of the radiation available allows measurements on a short time scale or with high spatial resolution (or both), so heterogeneous changes induced by a chemical process can be recorded while they occur. The penetrative nature of the radiation (e. g., X-rays, protons, or neutrons) also allows a sample to be studied in air. If necessary, complete artifacts (such as paintings or statuettes) can be examined. In situ analysis in a controlled environment, such as a liquid or corrosive atmosphere, also becomes an exciting possibility. Finally, there are many complementary techniques (local atomic structure or crystal structure determination, macroscopic 3 -D imaging (tomographies), imaging chemical analysis, and so on) so the many distinct details of a problem can be thoroughly explored. In this Account, we discuss the application of this general philosophy to studies of corrosion and its prevention in cultural heritage metals, focusing on our recent work on copper alloys. More specifically, we use synchrotron-based techniques to evaluate the use of corrosion potential measurements as a possible monitoring method for copper-based objects recovered from marine environments. The extraction of chlorides from such artifacts is a process that must take place before the artifacts are put on display or stored, because air exposure of untreated metal will result in severe damage or loss in as little as a few weeks. Chloride is removed by soaking the artifact for up to two years in tap water or dilute <b>sodium</b> <b>sesquicarbonate,</b> with regular solution changes. Our research supports the effectiveness of this treatment for thin nantokite (copper(I) chloride) layers, but it raises questions for copper hydroxychlorides (atacamite and paratacamite), especially when these minerals are trapped in fissures. Electrochemical parameters such as the corrosion potential are shown to be insensitive to the physical presence of large hydroxychloride coverages if they overlie a cuprite (Cu 20) layer. X-ray absorption spectroscopy proves to be a good monitor for the chloride in solution over the working electrode, whereas X-ray diffraction offers the potential for real-time measurement of the surface chloride composition. In principle, the two techniques together offer the possibility of monitoring Norma...|$|E
