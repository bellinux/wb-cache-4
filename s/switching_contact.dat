40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a randomized manipulation planner for a multi-fingered hand by <b>switching</b> <b>contact</b> modes. Manipulation planning {{for such a}} system should consider changing kinematics and dynamics of the system according to the contact modes. We derive the conditions that would be satisfied in manipulation planning, based on the kinematical properties of a manipulation system. The conditions allow the planner to assign more contact modes than those corresponding to the relative motion of contact points restricted by constraint forces. Consequently, this enables dextrous manipulation. In addition, the conditions give the restrictions of feasible contact modes {{and the number of}} contact points. Inspired by randomized motion planning techniques, we propose a new algorithm for manipulation planning in order to explore object configuration space, SE(3), rapidly and uniformly. The basis for this approach is for the construction of exploring random trees.

40|$|Vibration {{measurement}} {{has been}} adopted in some utilities in Australia, Canada and several European countries for online condition monitoring of power transformer’s On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC). By comparing measured vibration signals at different stages, {{it might be possible}} to assess changes of OLTC’s condition. However, there are still considerable difficulties in correlating vibration signals to events of OLTC operation, which may impair the capability of vibration measurement for OLTC condition monitoring. Therefore, arcing measurement is proposed in this paper to complement to vibration measurement. Arcing is provoked when OLTC <b>switching</b> <b>contact</b> closes at a fixed tap position and it can lead to electromagnetic signals flowing through transformer windings and finally reaches earth. The arcing measurement is achieved by using a High Frequency Current Transducer (HFCT) clamping on the transformer’s grounding cable. The joint vibration and arcing measurement can provide a better means for interpreting events involved in OLTC operation and facilitating an improved OLTC condition monitoring. Since HFCT measured arcing signals can be coupled with noise, a probabilistic wavelet transform is thus employed in this paper to extract arcing signals from noise. Field measurements on two different types of OLTCs are performed using the joint vibration and arcing measurement system to validate the proposed methodology...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Washington State UniversityThis {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} deformation in metallic materials which are possible choices for flexible electrical contacts. A contact for a micro mechanical switch has been fabricated using electroplated gallium (Ga) on silicon (Si) {{to create an}} electrical switch. The resistance increased with cycling but recovered to the original value after a thermal reflow. The hardness of thermally reflowed Ga droplets was 2 MPa when the droplets were unconstrained, and up to 95 MPa for constrained droplets, suggesting that all switching in this study caused permanent deformation at room temperature, and that defects formed during plastic deformation are likely candidates for the increased resistance during cycling. Larger contacts could be run for over 100 cycles with no significant increase in resistance. Electroplated Ga microdroplets have potential for carrying high current density (up to 200 A/cm 2). Oxidation behavior was characterized for the thermal reflow process on the Ga droplets, suggesting a passivating 30 nm oxide forms at 100 ºC, and electrical contact resistance nanoindentation suggests the oxide breaks during mechanical contact. A MEMS switch has been fabricated and created using electroplated gallium (Ga) and metal-polymer (gold-Kapton) freestanding membrane for a top and bottom electrode to characterize MEMS contacts and interconnects. Plasma and annealing treatment and an adhesion layer (titanium) was used to improve the low adhesion between the metal and polymer. The resistance of the bottom electrode with plasma treatment and the adhesion layer was lower than the other conditions. Additionally the <b>switching</b> <b>contact</b> of the plasma treated electrode with Ga droplets made higher a current density of the switch at the maximum current value (4. 6 × 10 - 3 A/cm 2) and the contact behavior was more stable than the others. The surface defects and deformation of Ga droplets after six switch cycles were restored after thermal reflow, so the same current value was measured compared to the first cycle. However, the resistance increased in steps due to necking between the droplets and bottom electrode. Engineering Science, Washington State Universit...|$|E
40|$|Scanning {{electrical}} probe-based storage using {{phase change}} materials is {{considered as a}} promising data storage technology due to its potential to meet future needs for ultra-high areal density, low-power, non-volatility, and rewritability. It is therefore important to understand and model the write, read and erase processes of this new technology, so that likely performance limits can be predicted and recording media and recording systems designed. Thus, this thesis presents a theoretical framework and associated computational model for write, read, and erase processes in electrical probe storage on phase change materials (Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5). Investigations of the write performance in this thesis are mainly focused on writing crystalline bits in an amorphous background, which is investigated using a parametric approach to assess {{the role of the}} electrical, thermal, and thickness properties of the media stack and probe tip on {{the size and shape of}} recorded bits, and on the write voltage and power required. In addition, advanced modeling techniques including heterogeneous nucleation, threshold <b>switching,</b> <b>contact</b> resistance and surface roughness are also introduced into the writing simulation in order to mimic more closely a practical recording environment. Based on these investigations, the design of an optimal media stack is proposed, which comprises a thin Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 layer sandwiched by a thin capping layer with fairly high electrical conductivity and low thermal conductivity and a thick underlayer with a high electrical conductivity and fairly low thermal conductivity. Readout performance is evaluated in this thesis by extending the previous 2 -D model to 3 D, aiming to pursue a realistic read current and understand effects of the noise on the read process. It is found that isolated crystalline bits extending through the amorphous matrix exhibits a better reading contrast than either crystalline bits embedded in the amorphous matrix or amorphous bits on top portion of the crystalline matrix. Isolated amorphous bits on the crystalline matrix give the narrowest read pulse width, the largest peak-peak readout signal, and the least noise effect, but the writing of amorphous bits is difficult due to the high field and temperature in the capping/underlayer. This thesis also investigated the erasure of both crystalline bits and amorphous bits in a scanning probe phase change memory. The amorphous bit in a crystalline matrix can be easily erased (re-crystallized), but the erasing of crystalline bits in an amorphous matrix is problematic and always accompanied by the formation of an unwanted crystalline ‘ring’ surrounding the originally recorded bit. Two novel approaches, i. e. patterned Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 media in an SiO 2 matrix and slow ‘growth’ material are proposed in order to overcome such a ‘ring’ effect. It was found that patterned Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 media can entirely remove the ‘ring’, but the thermal conductivity of the capping/underlayer needs to be chosen carefully to avoid high temperature appearing in these two layers. The fabrication of such patterned media on the nanoscale dimensions needed for ultra-high density storage is however problematic. The use of ‘slow-growth’ material improves the erase performance of continuous (i. e. unpatterned) Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 films, but without a complete removal of the ‘ring’. Finally, using the optimized design of media stack and a suitable probe tip the feasibility of writing and reading at an areal density of 10 Tbit/inch 2 has been demonstrated, with a much lower power/energy (1. 08 pJ/bit) than in any previous work.
