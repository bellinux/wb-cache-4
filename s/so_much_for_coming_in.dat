500|$|Paleoconservative {{activist and}} former presidential {{candidate}} Pat Buchanan has appeared twice as of 2011. In a June 2008 interview initiated and arranged by his publicist, he promoted his book Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War. During the broadcast, Buchanan defended Charles Lindbergh against charges of antisemitism, stating that his reputation [...] "has been blackened because of a single speech he gave {{and a couple of}} paragraphs in it where he said that... the Jewish community is beating the drums for warbut frankly, no one has said what he said was palpably untrue." [...] At the end of the interview, James Edwards said, [...] "Mr. Buchanan, thank you <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming</b> back on our program, for fighting for our people." [...] Previously, in September 2006, Buchanan had made an appearance to promote his book State of Emergency; during this interview, he said that [...] "we are being invaded by people of different cultures" [...] and argued that Americans [...] "cannot survive a bifurcated culture or a heavily Hispanicized culture, tilted towards Mexico... I think that's {{the beginning of the end}} of the United States." ...|$|R
5000|$|The concert {{began with}} the video {{introduction}} of [...] "Stripped Intro", featuring Aguilera handcuffed, blindfolded and {{sitting in a chair}} as the words [...] "scandal", [...] "gossip" [...] and [...] "lies" [...] flashed across the screen. Backed by a five-piece band and eight back-up dancers, Aguilera strutted out singing [...] "Dirrty" [...] and [...] "Get Mine, Get Yours", with curly black hair, a black and [...] "hot-pink halter with belly-baring plunging neckline", pants and spiked heels. She performed [...] "The Voice Within" [...] as the follow-up, with a long black dress. During the acoustic version of [...] "Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)", she gave a speech, [...] "Thank you <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming...</b> I'm getting that feeling again and it's a blessing. Yes, I've grown up a little bit. Now I'm 22... I'm so happy you've grown with me". Aguilera went onstage again, performing the [...] "Egyptian-turned-metal" [...] version [...] "Genie in a Bottle", where she rolled on a giant [...] "X" [...] which portrayed her then newly established alter ego [...] "Xtina". Wearing [...] "hot pink straps attached to her outfit", she slowly unraveled herself as the [...] "genie" [...] in the song, provocatively dancing her way out of the bottle. The performance of [...] "Can't Hold Us Down" [...] featured a pink [...] "spark-shooting" [...] motorcycle. Then, she belted out [...] "Make Over" [...] with the [...] "rhythmic trot of a Spanish spaghetti Western", featuring [...] "chain-link fence".|$|R
5000|$|The Stripped Tour's {{synopsis}} {{is quite}} similar to Aguilera's part during The Justified and Stripped Tour in 2003. The tour began with the video introduction of [...] "Stripped Intro", featuring Aguilera handcuffed, blindfolded and {{sitting in a chair}} as the words [...] "scandal", [...] "gossip" [...] and [...] "lies" [...] flashed across the screen. Then, the curtain dropped, she strutted out singing [...] "Dirrty" [...] and [...] "Get Mine, Get Yours", with big curly black locks, a black and hot-pink halter with belly-baring plunging neckline, pants and spiked heels. She performed [...] "The Voice Within" [...] as the follow-up, with a long black dress. The acoustic version of [...] "Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)" [...] sounded [...] "like a seasoned veteran of decades". During the performance, she gave a speech, [...] "Thank you <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>coming...</b> I'm getting that feeling again and it's a blessing. Yes, I've grown up a little bit.

60|$|It was Major Keith who {{had borne}} the tidings {{to the poor}} little widow, and had taken the sole care of the boys during the sad weeks of care utter prostration and illness. Female friends were with her, and tended her affectionately, but if {{exertion}} or thought were required of her, the Major had to be called to her sofa to awaken her faculties, and she always awoke to attend to his wishes, {{as though he were}} the channel of her husband's. This state of things ended with the birth of the little girl, the daughter that Sir Stephen had <b>so</b> <b>much</b> wished <b>for,</b> <b>coming</b> too late to be welcomed by him, but awakening her mother to tearful joy and renewed powers of life. The nine months of little Stephana's life had been a tone of continual change and variety, of new interests and occupations, and of the resumption of a feeling of health which had scarcely been tasted since the first plunge into warm climates. Perhaps it was unreasonable to expect to find Fanny broken down; and she talked in her own simple way with abundant overflowing affection of her husband; but even Mrs. Curtis thought it was to her more like the loss of her own father than of the father of her children; and though not in the least afraid of anything unbecoming in her gentle, retiring Fanny, still felt that it was more the charge of a girl than of a widow, dreaded the boys, dreaded their fate, and dreaded the Major more.|$|R
6000|$|But {{you will}} ask, [...] "What right have you {{to stand up}} and say {{anything}} so surprising?" [...] My friends, the world is full of surprising things, and this age above all ages. It was not sixty years ago, that a nobleman was laughed at in the House of Lords for saying that he believed that we should one day see ships go by steam; and now there are steamers on every sea and ocean in the world. Who expected twenty years ago to see the whole face of England covered with these wonderful railroads? Who expected on the 22nd of February last year, that, within a single month, half the nations of Europe, which looked so quiet and secure, would be shaken from top to bottom with revolution and bloodshed--kings and princes vanishing one after the other like a dream--poor men sitting for a day as rulers of kingdoms, and then hurled down again to make room for other rulers as unexpected as themselves? Can anyone consider the last fifty years?-- can anyone consider that one last year, 1848, and then not feel that we do live in a most strange and awful time? a time for which nothing is too surprising--a time in which we all ought to be prepared, from the least to the greatest, to see the greatest horrors and the greatest blessings come suddenly upon us, like a thief in the night? <b>So</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> Christ's <b>coming</b> being too wonderful a thing to happen just now. Still you are right to ask: [...] "What do you mean by Christ's being our King? what do you mean by His coming to us? What reason have you for supposing that He is coming NOW, rather than at any other time? And if He be coming, what are we to do? What is there we ought to repent of? what is there we ought to amend?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is eminently a good plan," [...] said Mr. George, [...] "for travellers. In {{planning}} a journey, we ought always to include this item in our calculations. We ought to allow <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> conveyance, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> hotel bills, and <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> losses, and then calculate on the losses {{just as much as}} we do on the payment of the railroad fares and hotel bills. That is the philosophy of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder, now, if I {{was divided}} up and inventoried," [...] said the latter {{as he ran}} over the paper, [...] "how much I might bring. Say <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the shape of my head, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> a high forehead, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> arms, and hands, and legs, and then <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> education, learning, talent, honesty, religion! Bless me! there would be small charge on that last, I'm thinking. But come, Eva," [...] he said; and taking the hand of his daughter, he stepped across the boat, and {{carelessly}} putting {{the tip of his}} finger under Tom's chin, said, good-humoredly, [...] "Look-up, Tom, and see how you like your new master." ...|$|R
