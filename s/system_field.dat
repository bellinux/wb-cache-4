5000|$|In the [...] "Detect-to-Protect" [...] {{biological}} detection program, Hultgren {{helped to}} develop sensors capable of detecting air-born biological materials, and field tested {{them in the}} Boston subway <b>system.</b> <b>Field</b> testing occurred in 2009 and in 2012. Hultgren sprayed dead Bacillus subtilis, a common, non-toxic, food-grade bacterium, in subway tunnels. Working with Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, and local public health officials, scientists monitored the dispersion and detection of the bacterium at Davis, Harvard, and Porter stations. The team's goal was to improve the effectiveness of its sensors as a possible early warning system for biological threats. Rather than collecting air filters daily and taking them to a lab for examination, installed sensors continuously monitored air quality by measuring polymerase chain reaction. ”Trigger” sensors were installed to establish the usual background levels of biological material, and “confirmers” were tripped when expected levels were exceeded. Thirty minutes after release, a “confirmer” at a station a mile away detected the airborne bacterium. The combination of on site ”trigger” and “confirmer” sensors was intended to minimize the occurrence of false alarms, which were a source of complaints with earlier systems.|$|E
