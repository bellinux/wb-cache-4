40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} the contribution of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to the diagnosis of tuberculous infection in children. Two different PCR techniques were compared to the standard bacteriological methods for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 157 specimens obtained from the respiratory system of 51 children. Patients were classified in three groups: 12 patients with active disease (57 specimens), 12 patients with <b>silent</b> tuberculous <b>infection</b> (23 tuberculosis (77 specimens). One PCR method (PCR/Ag 85) used amplification of a fragment of the genes coding for the mycobacterial antigen 85 followed by hybridization of a probe specific for M. tuberculosis on the Southern blot of amplified DNA. The other PCR technique was a nested PCR (NPCR) using double amplification of a fragment of the insertion element IS 6110 only present in the M. tuber culosis genome. The sensitivities of the different techniques, compared to the clinical diagnosis, were 7. 0 % for acid fast staining, 22. 8 % for culture, 24. 6 % for PCR/Ag 85 and 44. 9 % for NPCR in active disease, 4. 3 % for culture, 8. 7 % for PCR/Ag 85 and 28. 6 % for NPCR in <b>silent</b> tuberculous <b>infection.</b> The specificities were 100 % for culture, 94. 8 % for PCR/Ag 85 and 87. 9 % for NPCR. Among the 12 children clinically considered as having active tuberculosis, 1 had smear positive samples, 4 had at least one positive culture, 7 at least one positive PCR/Ag 85 and 9 at least one NPCR positive sample. Among the 12 children having <b>silent</b> tuberculous <b>infection,</b> none had positive smears, 1 had one positive culture, 2 had at least one positive PCR/Ag 85 and 5 at least one NPCR positive sample. Conclusion: Our study suggests that both PCR techniques, and especially NPCR, are able to detect M. tuberculosis DNA in specimens containing few micro-organisms. PCR methods are more sensitive than culture and the results are available more quickly. Testing multiple samples from the same individual increased the sensitivity. In view of occasional false-positive results, cultures remain the gold standard to establish definitive diagnosis of primary tuberculous infection in children.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 infection and replication in primary monocytes was investigated by mutagenesis of recombinant proviral clones containing an env determinant required for the infectivity of monocytes. Virus replication was assayed by determination of reverse transcriptase activity in culture fluids and by recovery of virus from monocytes following cocultivation with uninfected {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}}. Three virus replication phenotypes were observed in monocytes: productive infection, <b>silent</b> <b>infection,</b> and no infection. Incorporation of the monocytetropic env determinant in a full-length clone incapable of infection or replication in primary monocytes (no infection) conferred the capacity for highly efficient virus replication in monocytes (productive infection). Clones with the env determinant but lacking either functional vpr or vpu genes generated lower replication levels in monocytes. Mutation of both vpr and vpu, however, resulted in nearly complete attenuation of virus replication in monocytes, despite subsequent virus recovery from infected monocytes by cocultivation with uninfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (<b>silent</b> <b>infection).</b> These findings indicate a central role for the "accessory" genes vpu and vpr in productive human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in monocytes and indicate that vpu and vpr may be capable of functional complementation...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: New {{evidence}} indicates infections are emerging as {{risk factors for}} atherosclerosis although their specific {{role in the development}} and progression of atherosclerosis is still unclear. Case presentation: A 43 -year-old Caucasian man who had been treated for four years for multiple sclerosis progressively manifested systemic hypertension, polycythemia, peripheral arterial occlusion with intermittent claudication, and persistent headaches. In 2006, an instrumental analysis (magnetic resonance imaging) of our patient revealed widespread fibrocalcific atherosclerotic lesions which accounted for all his current symptoms, including those related to microbial stimulus. Two particular aspects were of interest, namely a lack of conventional cardiovascular risk factors and a negative family history for cardiovascular events. His chemical blood tests all yielded negative findings although a low positive hepatitis C virus-ribonucleic acid titer was detected. The titer had progressively increased and worsening atherosclerosis threatened the life of our patient. Interferon therapy was not appropriate for our patient due to the severe adverse effects observed shortly after its administration. Conclusions: The reaction of individual cells to infections may provide an explanation as to why individuals with a similar microbial burden, corrected for the presence of other risk factors, display a different susceptibility to developing or worsening atherosclerosis. The identification of susceptible individuals and the treatment even of <b>silent</b> <b>infections</b> may provide an additional tool against atherosclerosis and its clinical complications. The evaluation of cell susceptibility before and after the correction of risk factors may contribute to the assessment of the efficacy of drug therapy...|$|R

Implications and prevalence of infectious agents in the aetiology of early pregnancy loss is not yet well established. Aims/Objectives. In this study we will analyse chorionic villi derived from abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy (spontaneous abortion vs voluntary pregnancy interruption), in order to correlate the presence of infective viruses/bacteria and the incidence of miscarriage. The first objective of this project will be to find the viral DNA of HPV, BK and JC polyomaviruses and bacterial DNA of Chlamidia trachomatis, Ureaplasma parvum, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis in the aborted tissues collected from spontaneous abortion, and to compare the prevalence of these DNAs to those derived from elective specimens. Since chorionic villi are composed from different mesenchymal cell types, the second objective of the project will be the identification of viral/bacterial infections in specific target cells of aborted tissues. Methods. Chorionic villi derived from aborted tissues will be collected from women with spontaneous abortion (study group) and women undergoing voluntary pregnancy interruption (control group). Viral and bacterial DNA and RNA levels will be investigated by Real Time PCR and RT-PCR, respectively. Positive specimens for viral or bacterial DNA will be analyzed by in situ PCR amplification in order to find the target cell of the infection. Expected results. On the basis of the scientific literature, we expect to find a correlation between the prevalence of viral and/or infections and the rate of spontaneous abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy.

To examine the status of potential human infection by human influenza (H 1 N 1, H 3 N 2) and avian influenza (H 5 N 1, H 7 N 7, H 9 N 2) in the avian influenza epidemic area of Guangdong Province, China, we conducted a seroepidemiologic survey in the people of this area from April to June of 2004. Methods: Three out of 9 H 5 N 1 avian influenza affected poultry areas in Guangdong were randomly selected, and the population living within 3 kilometers of the affected poultries were chosen as the survey subjects. One thousand two hundred and fourteen people were selected from 3 villages at random. Human and avian influenza antibody titers were determined by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test and microneutralization test (MNT). Results: The positive rate of antibody to H 5 N 1 was 3. 03 % in the occupational exposure group and 2. 34 % in general citizens group; that of H 9 N 2 was 9. 52 % in the occupational exposure group and 3. 76 % in the general citizens group.

In addition to causing productive infections, a key feature of herpesviruses is their ability to establish latency. This non-productive phase lasts for the life time of the host, is characterized by a <b>silent</b> viral <b>infection</b> with intermittent reactivations, commonly clinical unapparent, resulting in intermittent shedding of infectious virus and spread throughout the population...|$|R
