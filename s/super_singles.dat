50|$|In Europe, <b>super</b> <b>singles</b> {{became popular}} when the allowed weight of {{semitrailer}} rigs was increased from 38 to 40 tonnes. In this reform the trailer industry replaced two 10 t axles with dual wheels, with three 8 t axles on wide-base single wheels. The significantly lower axle weight on <b>super</b> <b>singles</b> {{must be considered}} when comparing road wear from single versus dual wheels. The majority of <b>super</b> <b>singles</b> sold in Europe have a width of 385 mm. The standard 385 tires have a legal load limit of 4500 kg. (Note that expensive, specially reinforced 385 tires approved for 5000 kg do exist. Their market share is tiny, except for mounting on the steer axle.) A high share of research on road wear from heavy vehicles have failed to consider relevant axle load on <b>super</b> <b>singles,</b> as they compare road wear from 10-tonne axle load both dual wheels and on single wheels, instead of the relevant 8 - 9 t axle load on single wheels.|$|E
50|$|Although {{dual wheels}} {{are the most}} common, use of two single, wider tires, known as <b>super</b> <b>singles,</b> on each axle is {{becoming}} popular among bulk cargo carriers and other weight-sensitive operators. With increased efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, {{the use of the}} super-single tire is gaining popularity. There are several advantages to this configuration. The first of these is that <b>super</b> <b>singles</b> reduce fuel consumption. In 1999, tests on an oval track showed a 10% fuel savings when <b>super</b> <b>singles</b> were used. These savings are realized because less energy is wasted flexing fewer tire sidewalls. Second, the lighter overall tire weight allows a truck to be loaded with more freight. The third advantage is that the single wheel encloses less of the brake unit, which allows faster cooling and reduces brake fade.|$|E

50|$|Australian road {{transport}} {{has a reputation}} for using very large trucks and road trains. This is reflected in the most popular configurations of trucks generally having dual drive axles and three axles on the trailers, with four tyres on each axle. This means that Australian single semi-trailer trucks will usually have 22 tyres, which is generally more than their counterparts in other countries. Super single tyres are sometimes used on tri-axle trailers. The suspension is designed with travel limiting, which will hold the rim off the road for one blown or deflated tyre for each side of the trailer, so a trailer can be driven at reduced speed to a safe place for repair. <b>Super</b> <b>singles</b> are also often used on the steer axle in Australia to allow greater loading over the steer axle. The increase in loading of steer tyres requires a permit.|$|E
5000|$|On another Playart series, {{the name}} was printed with each letter a {{separate}} color, on bright packages marketed as FASTWHEEL (see photo). The phrase [...] "really fast - die cast" [...] was also printed on these blister-paks and boxes with the checkered black and white background. Playart diecast cars were also packaged as Charmerz for New York distributor Charles Merzbach (Johnson p. 187). These were marketed as Charmerz <b>Super</b> <b>Singles</b> and packaged in a blue blister card with many different vehicles listed on the back. The Playart name, however, did not accompany all toy packaging. Vehicle offerings were more clever than those of other Hong Kong and Chinese makers of the 1970s and 1980s. Marques such as a 1967 Eldorado, a Fiat X 1/9, a Rolls-Royce Corniche coupe, and a Lotus Elite were not necessarily unique in the diecast world, but {{taken as a whole}} the series was creative and model selections unique. Some of these may have been Tomica recasts. Despite tooling origins, however, one gets the feeling that the makers of Playart cars were auto enthusiasts perhaps more than other toy manufacturers. For example, the Playart Plymouth Barracuda (a former Hot Wheels casting) is realistically labeled a Barracuda Formula S on its base, showing a more refined automotive knowledge by the model creators. On the other hand, however, the 1969 Mustang Coupe only says [...] "Mustang" [...] on its base.|$|E

40|$|When {{designing}} roads it’s {{important to}} know what loads will be driven on it. The axles on heavy vehicles can either have <b>super</b> <b>single</b> tires or dual tires which, according to studies, damage the roads differently. The Swedish Transport Administration is developing an understanding for the character of these different kinds of axle and tire types on the loads induced on Swedish roads. In this thesis a field {{study was conducted to}} determine the distribution between axles with <b>super</b> <b>single</b> tires and axles with dual tires on heavy vehicles. A highway, a country road and a national road were investigated during the study. The result showed that the number of trucks with single tire axles, i. e. those with <b>super</b> <b>single</b> tires, varies between 39 and 48 percent on the different types of road. That the truck has a single tire axle means that the truck has at least one axle with single tires in addition to the steering axle. A small study was conducted to determine the width of tires on heavy vehicles. A comparison of trucks with single- and dual tire axles was carried out in terms of degradation of the roads. Permanent deformation of unbound layers and fatigue cracking were investigated since these degradation mechanisms are currently used as design parameters in the design of roads. Load values from Bridge Weight In Motion (BWIM) data were used in the calculations and vehicle type 113, 123 and 12211 were investigated. Permanent deformation and fatigue cracking were calculated according to the criteria given in ATB VÄG 2005. Dissipated Creep Strain Energy (DCSE) has been calculated for the selected truck types. The study showed that trucks with axles with single tires accelerate the degradation of the roads. The permanent deformation was almost the same for the two different kinds of axle types...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with producing a simple method to design low volume roads (LVR) {{by means of a}} rationale which accounts for permanent deformation development in granular layers. Rutting is regarded as the main distress mode in unsealed and thinly sealed pavements. Hence, it is desirable that it be analytically approached rather than empirically, as in most design methods. The overall aim of this PhD thesis was to look into the behaviour of in-service roads and from a newly developed process, to advance, in a systematic manner, the elements required to produce a simple mechanistic design procedure. The study took as its basis an assessment of the proximity of the stress distribution in the pavement to the material’s failure envelope. After a literature review on unbound granular materials mechanical behaviour and on low volume roads pavement design methods, Chapters 4 and 5 discuss full scale trials carried out in Scotland on typical forest roads. The overall goal of the trials carried out within the Roads Under Timber Transport project was to establish the effect of weather and seasonal effects on the rutting of forest roads and to improve their performance while enabling the roads to be economically constructed and maintained. It appears that most of the rutting occurring in the sites surveyed came shortly after their construction/resurfacing, leading to the assumption that workmanship may be a highly important variable. Lack of compaction of the layer {{could be one of the}} likely reasons for the high initial rutting rates. Establishing the effect of weather on rutting further to the existing knowledge was, however, difficult to achieve; this was mainly due to the difficulties faced in monitoring traffic conditions. A newly developed method was needed to quantify permanent deformation development due to wandering traffic on a non-level pavement; this was achieved by the use of wheel path areas, and seemed to be a way forward in the analysis of rutting in unsealed roads. Accelerated pavement trials are reported that aimed to evaluate the performance of aggregate under soaked conditions and the relative pavement deformation caused by different timber haulage vehicles. A road segment simulating a standard forest road section was constructed in a purpose-built facility located at the Ringour Quarry facility. Ten different trials were carried out combining three different aggregate materials and five types of vehicles. Tyre fitment, axle configuration and tyre pressure were assessed and demonstrated to play an important role on the study of rutting development. Conclusions drawn from the results suggest that management of the tyre inflation pressure and axle overload may be one of the most economic means of managing pavement deterioration in the forest road network. A mechanistic analysis of a variety of unsealed pavements was carried out in Chapter 6; and the newly proposed methodology is described in Chapter 7. With changing loading conditions – e. g. as a consequence of the introduction of Tyre Pressure Control Systems and super single tyres – more detailed analyses are required, so that their effect can be analytically assessed. Then an analytical method is introduced for evaluating the stress-strain condition in thinly surfaced or unsurfaced pavements as typically used in LVR structures. It aims to improve the understanding of the effect of tyre pressure and contact area in regard to permanent deformation. To achieve this, several scenarios were modelled using Kenlayer software varying aggregate material, thickness, stiffness, tyre pressure & arrangement. The results usually show a fairly well defined locus of maximum stresses. By comparing this stress envelope with failure envelope, conclusions could be established about the more damaging effect of <b>super</b> <b>singles</b> over twin tyres and, likewise, the greater damage inflicted by high tyre pressures compared to that incurred by lower tyre pressures. Finally, the framework of the proposed method contributes to LVR pavement design procedures mainly due to its simplicity. It still treats the pavement analytically, permitting a more fundamental description of the behaviour of granular layers than in simple linear elastic analysis, but by simplifying the elasto-plastic analysis for routine use it thereby reduces demands of material characterization and computational skills, thus increasing its utility in practical application.
