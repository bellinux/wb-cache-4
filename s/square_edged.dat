The body comprises a rectangular section of galvanized steel with <b>square</b> <b>edged</b> exterior panels {{mounted on a}} Toyota Land Cruiser Prado-derived chassis, and the outward appearance and detailing contains aspects of Chinese styling. Dimensionally it is 6.4 meters long, 2.05 meters wide, and 1.72 meters high. The HQE is priced at over 3,000,000 RMB or approximately US$439,300 (as of 2009). An armoured version of the car is also available. The Hongqi was designed at the FAW R&D facility in Changchun. The design team was staffed jointly by FAW and Magna Steyr, and contained members from China, Austria, the United Kingdom and the United States.|$|E
50|$|Structurally, {{the wing}} was built around two spars. Over {{most of the}} span the wings had {{parallel}} chord but the outermost section, where the ailerons were carried, tapered to straight tips. A pair of parallel aluminium struts inside streamlined spruce fairings took lift and drag loads to the lower fuselage longerons. There were additional vertical struts, small ones as on the F.190 but more sturdy ones under the outboard engines. The empennage of the F.280 was also {{similar to that of}} the F.190, with a double strutted rectangular tailplane carrying separate elevators, with a rudder cut-out between them.

A definitive version was subsequently published in Journal of Wind Engineering and Industrial Aerodynamics, 125, 2014, DOI: 10. 1016 /j. jweia. 2013. 11. 002 The wake of a fastback type passenger vehicle is characterised by trailing vortices from the rear pillars of the vehicle. These vortices strongly influence all the aerodynamic coefficients. Working at model scale, using two configurations of the Davis model with different rear pillar radii, (sharp edged and 10 mm radius) the flow fields over the rear half of the models were investigated using balance measurements, flow visualisations, surface pressure and PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) measurements. For a small geometry change between the two models, the changes to the aerodynamic loads and wake flow structures were unexpectedly large with significant differences to the strength and location of the trailing vortices in both the time averaged and unsteady results. The <b>square</b> <b>edged</b> model produced a flow field similar to that found on an Ahmed model with a sub-critical backlight angle. The round edged model produced a flow structure dominated by trailing vortices that mix with the wake behind the base of the model and is weaker. This flow structure was more unsteady than that of the <b>square</b> <b>edged</b> model. Consequently, although both models can be described as having a wake dominated by trailing vortices, there are significant differences to both the steady state and unsteady flow fields that have not been described previously. This also shows that the fastback wake structure described by Ahmed is not definitive...|$|E

40|$|Recently Agriculture Department of Liguria Region had {{supported}} studies and researches on the timber quality of living trees in local coppice chestnut forests, {{with the prospect}} to produce also timber for structural use. Under some ad-hoc funds a 30 years old coppice forest in the high Bormida Valley, never thinned after the last utilization, has been chosen for sampling. 18 selected trunks were felled and the assortment called “Uso Fiume” (UF) was chosen, getting 49 beams (cross-section from 12 ¥ 12 to 24 ¥ 24 cm), by way of saw-mill operations The UF-beam is a structural element, derived from Italian tradition. Such elements are used in Italian buildings over the time, in substitution to structural sawn timber, principally for roofing. The UF-beam is a <b>square</b> <b>edged</b> log with wane; more precisely it is a full log, edged on four sides, maintaining boxed heart and an approximately central pith. Today the features of such a beam is established according to the specific Italian standard UNI 11035 - 3 for spruce and fir and to the CUAP (Common Understanding of Assessment Procedure) n. 03. 24 / 22 for chestnut and conifers. The beams were visually graded according to the Visual Strength Grading procedure and the physical and mechanical properties (density, modulus of elasticity-MOE and modulus of rupture- MOR) were determined according to the standard requirements (EN 408, EN 384, ISO 3131), disregarding the moisture content: the mechanical tests were performed with wood in green state (moisture content M. C. > 30 %) {{because it is the}} actual condition of use in building, due to the very low permeability of the chestnut heartwood which entails long seasoning time of large cross section beams. The study showed very high yields considering the stems-to-beams volume ratio, close to 70 %. Characteristics values of the sample resulted: char. density kg/m³, char. modulus of elasticity E 0,mean 10, 3 GPa and char. bending strength fm,k 28, 5 MPa. These results can be considered very promising because the data match the Strength Class D 24 (EN 338), the same Class as full cross-section chestnut beams (at M. C. = 12 %). </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between in vivo captured data from an atmospheric pressure chemical ionisation mass spectrometer (APCI-MS) and sensory/psychophysical analyses was investigated. The stimuli used were mainly single volatiles under gas phase control or calibration by development of different olfactometry methods. Gas phase concentration retronasal (via the mouth to the nasal cavity) and orthonasal (via the nostrils) thresholds were determined for a trained panel of 13 individuals. Four volatiles were used with different sensory/physico-chemical properties and an adapted staircase method {{was employed to}} measure the individual thresholds. The data showed good repeatability over short durations of one week and also longer ones of eight months. It {{was used to test}} the hypothesis that thresholds varied between people due to differences in their in-nose concentration as measured or estimated by the APCI-MS. The analysis did not support this theory but relationships between orthonasal and retronasal thresholds were shown, in which the latter were - 50 times lower than the former. Threshold determination of a larger group of 20 individuals revealed clusters of individuals. Methods of producing <b>square</b> <b>edged</b> pulses of aroma compound in the gas phase were developed using a modified chromatograph autosampler with a gas flow of 5 mL. min 1 and pulse rate of 0. 6 secs. A trained panel of 23 individuals performed two types of sensory test using pulsed and constant olfactometer outputs of isoamyl acetate. The original intention was to reveal whether pulsed odorants were perceived as the same as or different to constant concentration. Initial experiments yielded results that were difficult to interpret, although the nature of the results was clarified when simultaneous breath by breath analysis techniques were employed. Here it was shown that each individual in different repetitions disrupted the olfactometer output pattern in unpredictable ways. This pattern disruption was measured in two instrumental configurations, as either volatiles in an exhalation or volatiles as they were inhaled together with two types of sensory test. In both sensory tests the pattern of aromas in an inhalation revealed a relationship with perception. In particular, the sensory response in the time intensity study was related to differences in the inhalation profiles between people, which in turn was related to an individual's breathing. This shows that physiological differences such as breathing and the structure of the nasal cavity have an impact on perception. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Study on cell {{growth on}} the {{posterior}} capsule after implantation of 6 {{different types of}} IOL with different design and material in a rabbit model and comparison of posterior capsule opacification (PCO). 1) Acrysof SA 60 AT (Alcon) made of hydrophobic acrylic. 2) Acrysof MA 60 BM (Alcon) made of hydrophobic acrylic. 3) Akreos Disc (Bausch & Lomb) made of hydrophylic acrylic. 4) Akreos Fit (Bausch & Lomb) made of hydrophylic acrylic. 5) CeeOn Edge 911 A (Pharmacia) made of silicone. 6) Clariflex (Advanced Medical Optics) made of silicone. These IOLs had the same optic geometry (<b>square</b> <b>edged)</b> but different material and design {{and we wanted to}} study if the inhibition of PCO was influenced by different materials and designs of IOLs. Methods: Each rabbit was anesthetized. Phacoemulsification surgery through a clear corneal incision was performed in 52 rabbit eyes using an aseptic technique The IOLs mentioned above were implanted into these eyes. Ηistological sections of each globe were prepared to document the evaluation of PCO. All rabbits were evaluated at day 1 and at 1, 2 and 3 weeks for ocular inflammatory response, corneal edema and PCO, and retroillumination photos were taken with the pupil dilated. Euthanasia was performed Enucleation of the globes was performed 3 weeks after surgery. Photographs from the posterior aspect (Miyake-Apple posterior view) were performed to evaluate PCO. Central PCO (CPCO), peripheral PCO (PPCO), Sommering’s ring (SR) formation were evaluated 3 weeks after surgery using the Miyake-Apple posterior photographic technique. The intensity of CPCO, PPCO and Sommering’s ring were scored from 0 to 4. Histological sections of each globe were prepared to document the evaluation of PCO. The anterior segments of the eyes were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, and Masson’s trichrome. Immunohistochemistry was performed. Type of growth, extension of PCO, cell type, inhibition, and fibrosis. The number of each cell type which was developed in different areas was estimated. Scanning Electron Microscopy study of the IOLs was also performed. Results: No statistically significant difference in central PCO or in peripheral PCO was noted between the 6 types of IOLs. No statistically significant difference in PCO or PPCO was noted among hydrophobic acrylic IOL, hydrophilic acrylic IOL and silicone IOLs. The CPCO was low in all groups. However there was statistically significant difference in Sommering’s ring (SR) being more intense SR in Acrysof SA 60 AT than in Acrysof MA 60 BM. CeeOn Edge 911 A and Clariflex presented more intense SR in comparison to Acrysof MA 60 BM. There was a statistically significant difference between hydrophilic and non hydrophilic (hydrophobic acrylic and silicone IOLs) regarding the extension of cells, being more in the hydrophilic group. Conclusion: PCO was not influenced by the material of the IOL or the design of the haptics of the IOLs we studied. ...|$|E
