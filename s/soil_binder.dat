Of the three types of biopolymers, polysaccharidess have proven more useful as <b>soil</b> <b>binders</b> than polynucleotides or polypeptides. Biopolymers that have been tested for use in soil stabilization include cellulose, starch, chitosan, xanthan, curdlan, and beta-glucan. Some biopolymers are sensitive to water, and wetter soils exhibit weaker biopolymer-clay cohesion. Because of this, when wetted, gel-type biopolymers form hydrogels which have decreased tensile strength but significantly higher compressive strength compared to the original soil. Protein-based biopolymers, though less common, have been used as an alternative to polysaccharides for projects requiring greater water resistance.|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} plants and plant {{resources}} {{was carried out in}} Maidan Valley, District Dir of North West Frontier Province (NWFP) of Pakistan to assess and analyze the potential and problems of the area. It is the first attempt to explore extensively Maidan Valley with particular emphasis on medicinal plants and biodiversity of the area. Maidan Valley is experiencing high population pressure on its land and forest resources with a population density of 453 /km 2 and a growth rate of 3. 0 percent per annum. Intensive exploration of Maidan Valley shows that 757 Angiosperm species are found here representing 113 families and 420 genera, among these families Asteraceae is the leading one with 61 species in almost all habitats showing their highest ecological amplititude. 10 species were recorded as new addition to the flora of Pakistan from Maidan Valley. The gymnosperms are represented by three families with 10 species of 8 genera. Out of these, 7 species are indigenous {{and the rest of the}} 3 are exotic. 29 moss species of 19 genera representing 11 families has been recorded which is considered as one of the highest number of mosses from a single valley, as comparable to any area of Pakistan. The liverworts species collected were 14 belongs to 10 genera. 19 Pteridophytes species with 12 genera distributed among 9 families in Maidan Valley. Various species of mushrooms can be seen in the area but the prominent with high economic value are Morchella esculenta and Morchella conica. The ethnobotanical information revealed that there are 46 different uses of 363 plants in the valley. The number of plants in each use were quantified and the major uses are of 274 plant species as medicine, 96 fuel wood, 43 pot herb, 30 fencing, hey fodder 26, <b>soil</b> <b>binder</b> 24, furniture 23, fodder and poison 22 species each. The part use data shows that mostly the leaves, whole plant, fruit and stem are in common use. There are 77 species belonging to 70 genera and 49 families used in different monoherbal and polyherbal recipes. The plants used as fodder are 85 species of 41 families and 77 genera. Among them 18 are grasses, 43 are herbs and shrubs and 25 are trees. Fuel wood species are the main sources of cooking energy and the most popular fuel in the Valley. Use of multi-fuels, is the common energy strategy in the household sector. High costs of electricity restrict its use as fuel. About 10 % people are engaged in collection of fuel wood directly from the forest areas whereas 54 % people purchase fuel wood from the local shops and 36 % obtain fuel wood from their farmlands. It has been discovered that due to several factors the species are no more available in their respective habitats due to over collection and has been threatened by unsustainable extraction, grazing, cutting, deforestation, unawareness and misuse. one of the major causes of the degradation of forests is poverty that most of the people live below poverty line in hilly areas. Sustainable harvest of natural resources may help to partly alleviate poverty. Programmes for natural resources management must become integral parts of overall developments strategies. There are 96 threatened plant species in Maidan Valley, of which 34 species were ranked as critically endangered, 26 species endangered, 20 species vulnerable and 16 species were assessed as infrequent. The flora of Maidan Valley has 12. 33 % threatened plants, 4. 37 % critically endangered, 3. 34 % endangered, 2. 57 % vulnerable and 2. 06 % are infrequent.

Two types of binders have been used i. e. cement and an industrial by-product named Petrit T. The study covered both the immediate and longterm effects on the <b>soil</b> material. <b>Binder</b> content was added by soil dry weight, Petrit T at 2, 4 and 7 % and cement at 1, 2, 4 and 7 %. An experimental program has been carried out, including tests of consistency limits, unconfined compressive strength, density, solidification, grain size distribution (by laser particle size analyzer) and pH. The tests were conducted on the treated <b>soil</b> with varying <b>binder</b> contents and after different curing periods, i. e. after 7, 14, 28, 60 and 90 days. Results show that cement is more effective in improving the physical and engineering properties than Petrit T. Plasticity index decreases after treatment and leads to an immediate increase in workability. This is found directly after treatment and it increases with time. Soil density increased, whilst water content decreased, with increasing binder content and curing time. Particle size distribution of soil is changed toward the granular side by {{the reduction of the}} particles in clay size fraction and increasing silt size particles after 28 days of treatment. Both binder types resulted in an immediate effect on the soil pH value. This value increased to 12. 3 after adding 7 % of the binder and then it gradually decreased as curing time increased. The cement treated soil exhibits a more brittle failure behavior than the soil treated with Petrit T. In this case a more ductile behavior was observed. The findings confirmed that adding small binder contents of cement and by-product Petrit T significantly improved the physical and mechanical properties of soil, which can contribute to reduce the environmental threats and costs that are associated with using high binder contents in various construction projects...|$|R

As a result, physical, chemical and combustion properties of the material are much improved [9, 10, 11]. In addition, transportation and storage is enhanced. Numerous research [12, 13, 14, 15, 16] have been done on briquette production and characterization. A lot of efforts have been made to study briquettes from different sources [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Properties such as volatile matter, calorific value, relaxed density, compressed density, ash content, durability, fixed carbon, dimensional stability, compressive strength, etc., vary with raw material, binder type, compacting pressure and temperature. Therefore, these properties cannot be generalized. During briquette making, some biomass naturally binds when subjected to favourable temperatures and pressures because they have lignin [4, 22, 23]. However, if these conditions are not met then a binder is required to complete the process. Some of the binders which are normally used include starch, molasses, clay, dung, gum, among others. These binders have impact on briquette properties. For instance, Ngusale et al.

40|$|The use of alkali {{activated}} binders {{to improve}} engineering properties of clayey soils {{is a novel}} solution, and {{an alternative to the}} widely diffused improvement based on the use of traditional binders such as lime and cement. In the paper the alkaline activation of two fly ashes, by-products of coal combustion thermoelectric power plants, has been presented. These alkali activated binders have been mixed with a clayey soil for evaluating the improvement of its mechanical behaviour. One-dimensional compression tests on raw and treated samples have been performed with reference to the effects induced by type of binder, binder contents and curing time. The experimental evidences at volume scale of the treated samples have been directly linked to the chemo-physical evolution of the binders, investigated over curing time by means of X Ray Diffraction. Test results showed a high reactivity of the alkali activated binders promoting the formation of new mineralogical phases responsible for the mechanical improvement of treated soil. The efficiency of alkali activated <b>binders</b> <b>soil</b> treatment has been highlighted by comparison with mechanical performance induced by Portland cement...|$|R
