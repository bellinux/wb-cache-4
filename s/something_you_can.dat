On June 30, 2017, she {{was appointed to}} the Order of Canada. Of the honor she said, [...] "I am a very, very proud Canadian, I am proud of where I am from, and to be recognized in this nature is surreal. It's not <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> dream about happening to you. I can dream of winning a World Cup or an Olympic gold medal, and that's my job, but to have your country recognize you – I don't even know what to say." ...|$|E
500|$|In an 8 November 2002 Slate article, Chris Suellentrop likened Potter to a [...] "trust-fund kid whose {{success at}} school is largely {{attributable}} to the gifts his friends and relatives lavish upon him". Noting that in Rowling's fiction, magical ability potential is [...] "something you are born to, not <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> achieve", Suellentrop wrote that Dumbledore's maxim that [...] "It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities" [...] is hypocritical, as [...] "the school that Dumbledore runs values native gifts above all else". In a 12 August 2007 New York Times review of Deathly Hallows, however, Christopher Hitchens praised Rowling for [...] "unmooring" [...] her [...] "English school story" [...] from literary precedents [...] "bound up with dreams of wealth and class and snobbery", arguing that she had instead created [...] "a world of youthful democracy and diversity".|$|E
500|$|Whedon uses several disorienting {{effects to}} heighten {{the reality of}} the {{situations}} in the episode {{to the point that they}} seem surreal. The long opening shot of Buffy coming home and finding Joyce was filmed with one hand-held camera in constant movement as she walks through the house to the phone and back to her mother again. The buttons on Buffy's phone are abnormally large, an effect that Whedon added because he experienced it when his mother died. Buffy is so bewildered by the paramedic telling her that Joyce is dead that she can only focus on his mouth in an attempt to understand what he is saying. The camera uses her perspective and only the bottom part of the paramedic's face is in view. Instead of a normal [...] "over-the-shoulder" [...] view, Buffy is shot at the same height as the paramedic's shoulder, barely squeezed into the frame as if to portray her, according to Whedon, as trapped by reality. Kristine Sutherland stated that the script was [...] "amazing", specifically at capturing the detachment: [...] "It's not <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> process. I mean mortality is just not part of your vocabulary when you're that age." ...|$|E

500|$|Madonna has {{received}} acclaim {{as a role}} model for businesswomen in her industry, [...] "achieving the kind of financial control that women had long fought for within the industry", and generating over $1.2billion in sales within the first decade of her career. Professor Colin Barrow from Cranfield School of Management described Madonna as [...] "America's smartest businesswoman... who has moved to the top of her industry and stayed there by constantly reinventing herself." [...] London Business School academics called her a [...] "dynamic entrepreneur" [...] worth copying; they identified her vision of success, her understanding of the music industry, her ability to recognize her own performance limits (and thus bring in help), her willingness to work hard and her ability to adapt as the keys to her commercial success. Morton wrote that [...] "Madonna is opportunistic, manipulative, and ruthless—somebody who won't stop until she gets what she wants—and that's <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get at the expense of maybe losing your close ones. But that hardly mattered to her." [...] Hazel Blackmore and Rafael Fernández de Castro in the book ¿Qué es Estados Unidos? from the Fondo de Cultura Económica, noted: [...] "Madonna has been undoubtedly the most important woman in the history of popular music and a great businesswoman in herself; creating fashion, breaking taboos and provoking controversies." [...] According to Forbes, Madonna is the wealthiest woman in the music business.|$|E

2500|$|The band's sixth album, Icky Thump, was {{released}} in 2007, and unlike their previous lo-fi albums, it was recorded in Nashville at Blackbird Studio. The album {{was regarded as a}} return to the band's earlier blues and garage-rock sound. It debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart, and entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, selling over 300,000 vinyl copies in England alone. Of his excitement for vinyl, White explained, [...] "We can't afford to lose the feeling of cracking open a new record and looking at large artwork and having <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hold in your hands." [...] In support of the album, they launched a Canadian tour, in which they played a gig in every one of the country's provinces and territories. However, later that year, the band announced the cancellation of 18 tour dates due to Meg's struggle with acute anxiety. A few days later, the duo cancelled the remainder of their 2007 UK tour dates as well.|$|E
2500|$|Happy Together {{tells the}} story of a couple (Tony Leung Chiu-wai and Leslie Cheung) who travel to Buenos Aires in an effort to save their relationship. Wong decided to change the {{structure}} and style from his previous films, as he felt he had become predictable. Teo, Brunette, and Jeremy Tambling all see Happy Together as a marked change from his earlier work: the story is more linear and understandable, there are only three characters (with no women at all), and while it still has Doyle's [...] "exuberant" [...] photography it is more stylistically restrained. After a difficult production period – where a six-week shoot was dragged out to four months – the film was released in May 1997 to great critical acclaim. It competed for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, where Wong became Hong Kong's first winner of the Best Director Award (an achievement he downplayed: [...] "it makes no difference, it’s just <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> put on an ad.") ...|$|E
2500|$|That {{is such a}} {{difficult}} question. There are times when certain people are blessed—and cursed—with an extraordinary gift, in which the gift is almost greater than the human being. Callas {{was one of these}} people. It was as if her own wishes, her life, her own happiness were all subservient to this incredible, incredible gift that she was given, this gift that reached out and taught us things about music that we knew very well, but showed us new things, things we never thought about, new possibilities. I think that is why singers admire her so. I think that's why conductors admire her so. I know it's why I admire her so. And she paid a tremendously difficult and expensive price for this career. I don't think she always understood what she did or why she did it. She usually had a tremendous effect on audiences and on people. But it was not something she could always live with gracefully or happily. I once said to her [...] "It must be a very enviable thing to be Maria Callas." [...] And she said, [...] "No, it's a very terrible thing to be Maria Callas, because it's a question of trying to understand <b>something</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> never really understand." [...] She couldn't really explain what she did. It was all done by instinct. It was something embedded deep within her.|$|E
