Studies with scaly-breasted munia show that the intensity of aggressive encounters was highest when patch location was <b>signaled,</b> {{and the effect of}} changing resource density depended on whether patch location was <b>signaled</b> or not.

Changing patch density had no effect on the number of aggressive encounters when the location of food was not <b>signaled.</b> When food location was <b>signaled,</b> increasing patch density resulted in the predicted {{decrease in the number of}} aggressive encounters.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{development}} of information science and computing technology, the theory of digital filters design and application has achieved leap-forward development. We encounter a variety of <b>signals</b> in real-life, such as broadcasting <b>signals,</b> television <b>signals,</b> radar <b>signals,</b> mobile phone <b>signals,</b> navigation <b>signals,</b> radio astronomy <b>signal,</b> biomedical <b>signals,</b> control <b>signals,</b> weather <b>signal,</b> seismic <b>signal,</b> mechanical vibration <b>signal,</b> remote sensing and telemetry <b>signals,</b> etc. Most of these <b>signals</b> are analog <b>signals</b> and just {{a small portion of}} them are digital <b>signals.</b> The analog <b>signals</b> are continuous function of the independent variables, which can be one-dimensional, two-dimensional or multidimensional. In most cases, the variable of one-dimensional analog <b>signals</b> are time. After the time sampling and discretization of magnitude, such analog <b>signal</b> will become a one-dimensional digital <b>signal.</b> The resulting digital <b>signal</b> can be represented by a discrete sequence. For example, one common <b>signal</b> is voice <b>signal.</b> An example of a two-dimensional <b>signal</b> is an image. A filter is a system that can transform a <b>signal</b> into another <b>signal.</b> Examples of such transformation include smoothing the <b>signal</b> for noise removal, removing frequency components from a <b>signal</b> and amplifying frequency components for <b>signal</b> enhancement. The design and implementation of filter is an important branch in <b>signal</b> analysis and processing technology.
