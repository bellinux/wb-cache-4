2500|$|Many devotees visited Ramana Maharshi for darshan, {{the sight}} of a holy person or God incarnate, which is {{advantageous}} and transmits merit. According to Flood, in Indian religions the guru is akin to the image or statue of a deity in the temple, and both possess power and a <b>sacred</b> <b>energy.</b> According to Osborne, Ramana Maharsi regarded giving darshan as [...] "his task in life," [...] and said that he had to be accessible to all who came. Even during his terminal illness {{at the end of his}} life, he demanded to be approachable for all who came for his darshan.|$|E

For Sikhs, our living Guru exists within the sacred words of our tradition and physically within the Sikh holy book known as the Guru Granth Sahib.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Early 20th-century {{scholars}} {{also saw}} mana {{as a universal}} concept, found in all human cultures and expressing fundamental human awareness of a <b>sacred</b> life <b>energy.</b> In his 1904 essay, [...] "Outline of a General Theory of Magic", Marcel Mauss drew on the writings of Codrington and others to {{paint a picture of}} mana as [...] "power par excellence, the genuine effectiveness of things which corroborates their practical actions without annihilating them". Mauss pointed out the similarity of mana to the Iroquois orenda and the Algonquian manitou, convinced of the [...] "universality of the institution"; [...] "a concept, encompassing the idea of magical power, was once found everywhere".|$|R

The book is most well known for first discussing the Hundredth monkey effect. Lyall Watson was a friend of Blair's and wrote a foreword for the book.|$|R
30|$|While {{water in}} the Hindu view {{operates}} as a viable symbol for <b>sacred</b> and erotic <b>energy,</b> it is also seen as crucial to the chemical constitution of procreative fluids and tissues themselves. In the male human body, for instance, one’s seed (semen or retas) is a substance which appears in liquid form, and is thus largely constituted {{by the presence of}} water. According to Yoga philosophy—systematized by Patanjali in roughly the early 5 th century CE—there are important spiritual benefits to be gained through one’s preservation of sexual fluids, which is accomplished through sustained celibate behavior (brahmacharya).|$|R

Internal and external signs of this state are clearly defined: the body is cured of diseases; the mind is serene, at rest with no thoughts; a stream of ambrosia is poured inside the body of the yogi, accompanied by a feeling of tremendous joy and bliss. According Sri Jñāneśvar this state is not achieved by training of the mind nor by willful control. It is transmitted from guru to disciple in the Nath tradition. Shri Jñāneśvar (Dnyaneshwar), who describes this unique state of consciousness in yoga, is a disciple of Shri Nivrittinath. In Sahaja yoga few threads of the <b>sacred</b> <b>energy</b> Kundalini rise spontaneously and gradually grow in number.|$|E
50|$|In {{the other}} world, the {{ancestors}} are the actual carrying-holders of transcendent sacred energies. However, the Pangool are superior in title {{because they were}} not transformed in the <b>sacred</b> <b>energy.</b> Thus the distinction between a fangool (non-human) and a human-ancestor lies in the mode of their participation in the transcendence. In either case, Roog is the first source of the transcendence of sacred energies.|$|E

In feng shui terminology, the site fits {{the ideals of}} [...] "sơn chầu thủy tụ" [...] (mountains and rivers gather), [...] "long chầu hổ phục" [...] (dragons and tigers prostrate), [...] "phượng bay ngựa chạy" [...] (phoenixes ascend and horses gallop), abundant of [...] "khí thiêng sông núi" [...] (<b>sacred</b> <b>energy</b> of the land). The rugged hills provide protection against attacks yet with the rivers coursing through, afford easy access. Phú Thọ being at the confluence of three major rivers: the Đà River with its black water, the Thao river with its red silt and the Lô River with its clear water, is well situated to link the uplands and the lower delta.|$|E

40|$|Marmas {{are part}} of a greater sacred {{physiology}} which maps the special sacred points just as the earth has its <b>sacred</b> sites and <b>energy</b> currents according to sacred geography. It is must to learn the sacred geography of our own body in order to attune ourselves both to the Earth and to the greater cosmos. Rujakara Marmas are the vital points in the human body which are 8 in number as Manibandha, Gulpha, Kurchashira in the upper limb and Kurchashira in the lower limb, each being two in number and cause severe pain when injured, hence the name “RUJAKARA”. The present paper highlights each of these points anatomically as per Ayurvedic literature and their modern correlation and try to conclude as what they can be compared structurally in the modern terms...|$|R
5000|$|The Well of Echoes {{itself is}} a portal of pure <b>energy,</b> <b>sacred</b> to the Aachim, which they send their dead to and {{sometimes}} use {{as a means of}} execution. An Aachim who believes their life has extended beyond its natural course will also give themselves to the Well. One Well of Echoes resides at Tirthrax, held in place by powerful magic. When Tiaan arrives at Tirthrax, the amplimet begins to communicate with the extremely powerful Nodes there, and draws power from it. It then uses this power to begin to thaw the Well and it takes all the effort of Malien to hold the Well in place. When Tiaan leaves Malien has a bitter struggle with the Well, but ultimately is able to renew the Great Spell that holds it in place, with her great Arts.|$|R
5000|$|Except for Shakta Puranas, Adi Shakti {{has never}} been {{mentioned}} with the name [...] "Adi Shakti". But indirectly, they also consider her to be supreme being.The concept of Adi shakti is very much similar to the modern discoveries {{in the field of}} Modern science and technology. Energy is basic entity that is base of all, as of Energy doesn't require a base. This is what when energy exist even after destruction of Universe. Science named it the Dark Energy responsible for destruction and Vacuum Energy which creates universe. An energy that exist even after destruction and before creation is called ZeroEnergy or <b>Sacred</b> <b>Energy</b> or Supreme Intelliegence.Scriptures like Devi Bhagwata Purana, four Vedas consider Kali as Dark energy which dissolute complete universe along with time. Lalita gives birth to the universe in the form of cosmic egg which later got banged to create manifested universe. Ultimately, Adi shakti herself is the Zero Energy which exist even after destruction of universe and before its creation.|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the folk songs on Kondh tribe; this thesis aims at {{exploring}} the subject of human sacrifice. It emphasizes on the significance of human sacrifice in various cultures around world since pre-historic times. Blood for its recognition as the <b>sacred</b> <b>energy</b> of life had been used as an offering for appeasing or recognizing debt towards god. These appeasements were mostly {{out of fear of}} natural calamities, diseases, wars and disasters which were believed to be the wrath of god for certain human activities, be it agriculture or hunting or usage of natural resources and bedding gratitude in certain cases for protecting from the same. Common throughout different cultures, the meaning of these ritualistic killing varied depending on the custom and religious beliefs. Indian Vedic culture too comprises of this custom. Yajurveda has numerous hymns dedicated only to sacrifice. Shakti worshipers, Thugs, and Fakirs were other such notorious illustrations of involving the same tradition. Sacrifices were executed as thanksgiving for providing good crops, curing diseases, blessing their families and tribe to flourish, to prosper and protect them from preys and woes. Kondhs too had their specific custom of practicing human sacrifice as a community obligation. In spite of the criticisms and restrictions, human sacrifice still exists and there are seldom occurrences of it for the pre-existing reasons...|$|E
50|$|The Navajo and Hopi {{people have}} long embraced the water {{underneath}} {{and around the}} Black Mesa area as sacred to their people. The people have long lived around and became dependent on springs and wells of the Black Mesa. These waters are {{the only source of}} drinking water, water for livestock, and water for agriculture for the Navajo and Hopi people. In respect for the water, these people carryout religious and ceremonial tributes to the water of the Black Mesa. These waters have organized their people around the Black Mesa and resulted in the reliance of the waters for all aspects of their lives. With the emergence of Peabody Energy came threats to the preservation of their <b>sacred</b> water. Peabody <b>Energy</b> pumps water out from underneath the Black Mesa to transport their mining minerals. In May 2002 the Navajo and Hopi people from northeastern Arizona joined their people in St. Louis Missouri to fight against Peabody Energy and its shareholders. In January 2002 Peabody proposed and was granted the right to use thirty-two percent more Navajo Aquifer (Naquifer) water than they had already been using. The significant increase in water pumped out of the Naquifer, dramatically affected the drinkability of the water from the springs and wells connected to the Naquifer. Before the significant increase of pumping, the water was clean enough to drink without any kind of purification. Another result of the pumping is the noticeable drop in the water levels of the springs and wells. The drop in water levels was almost immediately recognized after Peabody was granted permission to pump out more water. This had caused disruption in the ceremonial and cultural lives of the Navajo and Hopi people as well as disruption to their farming (Lee 2010).|$|R
