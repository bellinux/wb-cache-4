In 2008, {{the number of}} legislative <b>seats</b> was cut in half to 113, of which Taiwanese aborigines are represented by six members, three each for lowland and highland peoples. The tendency of Taiwanese aborigines to vote {{for members of the}} pan-blue coalition has been cited as having the potential to change the balance of the legislature. Citing these six <b>seats</b> in addition with five <b>seats</b> from smaller counties that also tend to vote pan-blue has been seen as giving the pan-blue coalition 11 <b>seats</b> before the first vote is counted.|$|E

5|$|Four columns {{were built}} through the {{existing}} Main Stand {{to support the}} Club Deck, which resulted in approximately 1,000 <b>seats</b> having a restricted view.

When a new playing surface was installed in 1992, Rangers were able to add a further 1,300 <b>seats</b> {{to the front of}} three stands by lowering the pitch slightly. The only standing area of the ground, the enclosure of the Main Stand, was seated in 1994 to comply with the Taylor Report and UEFA regulations.

The <b>seat</b> is a two-mode <b>seat</b> for a motor vehicle cooperable with an adult <b>seat</b> belt assembly to provide two modes operation including an adult <b>seat</b> mode and a child <b>seat</b> mode. The <b>seat</b> locates {{in the center of}} the rear <b>seat.</b> The structure of the <b>seat</b> was designed in detail. The height of the booster of the <b>seat</b> can be adjusted continuously according to the <b>seated</b> shoulder height of the child passenger. The depth of booster cushion also can be changed according to the size of the passenger. The sled test with the <b>seat</b> was conducted. The <b>seat</b> simulation models with different booster heights were developed using MADYMO software and validated. Then, these models were used to study the performance of the <b>seat</b> in frontal impact. Some key parameters of the <b>seat</b> were studied in simulation test.

40|$|A {{new type}} of car <b>seat</b> has been {{designed}} in which the back-rest is able to move freely in the vertical direction. The design allows the back-rest to follow the vertical vibration {{of the back of}} an occupant of the <b>seat.</b> This is intended to decrease any strain on the lumbar part of the spinal column caused by a different vertical motion at the <b>seat</b> squab and the <b>seat</b> back. The transmission of vertical (z axis) vibration from the base of this <b>seat</b> to the <b>seat</b> surface, to the back-rest and to the backs and heads of <b>seat</b> occupants has been measured. Measurements were made with the <b>seat</b> back fixed, to prevent vertical motion relative to the <b>seat</b> frame, and with the <b>seat</b> back free to move. Vibration transmissibilities from the <b>seat</b> base to the <b>seat</b> surface were characterized by a resonance at frequencies in the region of 4 Hz. The resonance frequencies were slightly higher with the fixed back-rest than with the moving back-rest. The transmissibilities at frequencies above 4 Hz -were generally higher with the fixed back-rest. Measurements with no contact between the <b>seat</b> occupants and the <b>seat</b> back indicated that the dynamic properties of the human body and the <b>seat</b> cushion were less influenced by the moving <b>seat</b> back than by the fixed <b>seat</b> back. Differential motion between the <b>seat</b> surface and <b>seat</b> back was smaller with the moving <b>seat</b> back than with the fixed back. © IMechE 1996. </p...|$|R

5|$|The {{total number}} of <b>seats</b> in the Parliament are {{allocated}} to parties proportionally {{to the number of}} votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d'Hondt method. For example, to determine who is awarded the first list seat, the number of list votes cast for each party is divided by one plus the number of <b>seats</b> the party won in the region (at this point just constituency <b>seats).</b> The party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat, which is then added to its constituency <b>seats</b> in allocating the second seat.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of the occupied vehicle <b>seat</b> is still challenging.

The structural dynamics of <b>seat</b> system changes when the <b>seat</b> is occupied by volunteers with different weights and different posture. Adding the occupant to the <b>seat</b> is reported to change the <b>seat</b> structural resonant frequencies. However, {{it is not clear how}} different occupants&# 039; weights and <b>seat</b> posture may change the <b>seat</b> vibration responses. The results of this investigation show that when the <b>seat</b> occupant weight increases, the lateral resonant frequencies of the <b>seat</b> decrease while fore-aft resonant frequency increases. Nevertheless, the results show that the <b>seat</b> torsion resonant frequency was not affected significantly by the occupant weight. Comparison of the lean-on and lean-off <b>seating</b> posture shows that the occupied <b>seat</b> in lean-off posture <b>seat</b> do not show significant structural resonant frequency changes from its corresponding unoccupied <b>seat.</b> This indicates that the interaction of the human body trunk and the seatback is relatively significant for the transmission of the vibration to the human body...|$|R
