5|$|While poorly documented, {{chemical}} communication {{is believed to}} be important to the group. Anal secretions are produced in the hindgut, and released along the posterior setae as predator deterrents In Australia, aggregations of male common blossom thrips have been observed on the petals of Hibiscus rosa-sinensis and Gossypium hirsutum; females were attracted to these groups so it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> males were producing pheromones.|$|E
5|$|The lumber {{used in the}} {{construction}} of Fort Jackson was either sold for salvage or scavenged by squatters, most of whom were freed slaves traveling north in a search for new lives following the ending of slavery in the United States. Many settled {{in the area of the}} former Fort Runyon, and it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lumber of Fort Jackson would have been a ready source of firewood.|$|E
500|$|The {{test of the}} Chitinozoa {{was fixed}} - there was no scope for any parts of it to move or rotate.

5|$|The lightest {{isotopes}} were synthesized {{by direct}} fusion between two lighter nuclei and as decay products. The heaviest isotope produced by direct fusion is 262Rf; heavier isotopes {{have only been}} observed as decay products of elements with larger atomic numbers, of which only 267Rf has been confirmed. The heavy isotopes 266Rf and 268Rf have also been observed as electron capture daughters of the dubnium isotopes 266Db and 268Db, but have short half-lives to spontaneous fission: it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{same is true of}} 270Rf, a likely daughter of 270Db. While the isotope 264Rf has yet to be observed, it is predicted to have a short half-life of 5s.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{political}} structures of late Middle Ages Italy have led some to theorize that its unusual social climate allowed {{the emergence of}} a rare cultural efflorescence. Italy did not exist as a political entity in the early modern period. Instead, it was divided into smaller city states and territories: the Kingdom of Naples controlled the south, the Republic of Florence and the Papal States at the center, the Milanese and the Genoese to the north and west respectively, and the Venetians to the east. Fifteenth-century Italy {{was one of the most}} urbanised areas in Europe. Many of its cities stood among the ruins of ancient Roman buildings; it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> classical nature of the Renaissance was linked to its origin in the Roman Empire's heartland.|$|E
5|$|It seems {{relatively}} {{certain that}} the Persian fleet was sent out to block the exit from the Straits the evening before the battle. Herodotus clearly believed that the Persian fleet actually entered the Straits at nightfall, planning to catch the Allies as they fled. However, modern historians have greatly debated this point, with some pointing out the difficulties of maneuvering in this confined space by night, and others accepting Herodotus's version. There are thus two possibilities; that during the night the Persians simply blocked the exit to the Straits, and then entered the straits in daylight; or that they entered the straits and positioned themselves for battle during the night. Regardless of when they attempted it, it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Persians pivoted their fleet off the tip of Cape Vavari, so that from an initial east-west alignment (blocking the exit), they came round to a north-south alignment (see diagram). The Persian fleet {{seems to have been}} formed into three ranks of ships (according to Aeschylus); with the powerful Phoenician fleet on the right flank next to Mount Aigaleo, the Ionian contingent on the left flank and the other contingents in the centre.|$|E
40|$|It is {{not easy}} to predict {{accurately}} (or even approximately) the future path of Federal budget deficits, as is well-illustrated by the predictions made a few year ago that ongoing surpluses would be so large that problems would arise from the lack of short-term federal debt! Nevertheless, it does <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> federal budget will record quite large deficit...|$|R

For example, the Madagascar dry deciduous forests with their long dry season and severe limestone ridden soils provide one ideal setting for pachypodium.|$|R
50|$|On 15 May 1679, the {{supporters}} of Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, had introduced the Exclusion Bill into the Commons {{with the aim of}} excluding the king's brother, James, Duke of York, from the succession to the throne. A fringe group began to support the claim of Charles's illegitimate son, the Duke of Monmouth. As it <b>seemed</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bill would pass, Charles exercised his Royal prerogative to dissolve Parliament.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, {{the watch}} {{was taken to}} the Interface Analysis Centre at Bristol University and studied by Dr Robert Wild using an {{electron}} microscope and Auger electron spectroscopy. Dr Wild found that:"Provided the watch has remained in a normal environment, it would <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> engravings were at least several tens of years age...in my opinion it is unlikely that anyone would have sufficient expertise to implant aged, brass particles into the base of the engravings".|$|R

25|$|Salvatore Broschi died {{unexpectedly}} on 4 November 1717, aged only 36, and it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> consequent loss {{of economic}} {{security for the}} whole family provoked the decision, presumably taken by Riccardo, for Carlo to be castrated. As was often the case, an excuse had to be found for this operation, and in Carlo's case it was said to have been necessitated by a fall from a horse.|$|E
25|$|An 1882 history {{suggests}} that the Martin house was built as early as 1730. But records show that all four of Hendrick Martin's children were baptized in Kaatsbaan, the last by 1743, suggesting the family had not moved across the river before that year. In 1751 the deed for the property which includes the house was recorded. It <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> house was built near the latter end of that period.|$|E

There was a slight rapid at <b>the</b> place, so <b>that</b> they had only to enter it at an angle with the bank and were swept across in a few moments, almost without requiring to use their paddles.|$|R

25|$|Ancient authors {{seemed to}} believe, incorrectly, that sling-bullets could {{penetrate}} armour, and that lead projectiles, heated by their {{passage through the}} air, would melt in flight. In the first instance, it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> authors were indicating that slings could cause injury through armour by a percussive effect rather than by penetration. In the latter case we may imagine that they were impressed by the degree of deformation suffered by lead sling-bullet after hitting a hard target.|$|E
25|$|Geographically, the {{traditional}} {{distribution of the}} djembe {{is associated with the}} Mali Empire, which dates back to 1230 AD and included parts of the modern-day countries of Guinea, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Gambia, and Senegal. However, {{due to the lack of}} written records in West African countries, it is unclear whether the djembe predates or postdates the Mali Empire. It <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> history of the djembe reaches back for at least several centuries, and possibly more than a millennium.|$|E
25|$|Hanam Sunim {{was in the}} Diamond Mountains, at Jangan Temple by 1922, {{and later}} just outside Seoul at Bongeun Temple in 1926. He left then and, perhaps {{intending}} {{to return to the}} Diamond Mountains, wound up staying in the Odae Mountains, at Sangwon Temple. (This would have been on his path to the Diamond Mountains.) As he was a very well known teacher, it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> monks at the nearby large temple, Woljeong Temple, had asked him to stay and teach.|$|E

25|$|In retrospect, it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{electrical}} discharges {{reported by}} Winkler in 1744 were started by CFE from his wire electrode. However, meaningful investigations {{had to wait}} until after J.J. Thomson's identification of the electron in 1897, and until after it was understood – from thermal emission and photo-emission work – that electrons could be emitted from inside metals (rather than from surface-adsorbed gas molecules), and that – in the absence of applied fields – electrons escaping from metals had to overcome a work function barrier.|$|E
25|$|Several Bactrian kings {{followed}} after Demetrius' death, and it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{civil wars}} between them {{made it possible}} for Apollodotus I (from c. 180/175 BC) to make himself independent as the first proper Indo-Greek king (who did not rule from Bactria). Large numbers of his coins have been found in India, and he seems to have reigned in Gandhara as well as western Punjab. Apollodotus I was succeeded by or ruled alongside Antimachus II, likely the son of the Bactrian king Antimachus I.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the male}} and female are in the 'T position', the {{pressing}} of the female against the male's body stimulates his release of sperm. Though the exact mechanism of fertilisation has yet to be scientifically documented, from the observations of aquarists who have been successful in breeding Corydoras catfishes, it <b>seems</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> female takes the male's sperm through her mouthparts, and directs them through the gills, in a current that carries the sperm to her pelvic fins. At this point, the female releases a single egg (occasionally two), and purses her pelvic fins in order to provide a receptacle for the freshly extruded egg, which is then fertilised.|$|E
50|$|In 2006 Koppinen helped Rosenborg win the Premier League, playing sixteen games. In the {{penultimate}} {{match of}} the 2006 Norwegian Premier League, Koppinen notably set up Rosenborg's deciding third goal against Viking by grabbing Viking's goalkeeper Mattias Asper's elbow, {{causing him to}} drop the ball. At <b>the</b> time, it <b>seemed</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> goal would lead to relegation for Viking. In post-match interviews, Koppinen initially denied any wrongdoing, but two days later he called Viking's director Egil Østenstad and asked for forgiveness.|$|R
50|$|It <b>seemed</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> company’s {{plans were}} in vain, but the dynamic {{contracting}} partnership of David Davies and Ezra Roberts entered into {{discussions with the}} directors and on 4 July 1862 they committed to build the line and provide rolling stock for £106,000. They were to be given nearly the whole capital of the company in cash in hand and fully paid up shares. They were financing the construction themselves. They undertook to complete the work by 21 July 1864.|$|R
5|$|Because Baltimore's {{electorate}} {{is overwhelmingly}} Democratic, whoever won the Democratic primary election {{was seen as}} the favorite over the Republican nominee in the general election. Baltimore's large African American population initially made it <b>seem</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> next mayor would also be African American. Kweisi Mfume was the preferred candidate of local politicians, but he opted not to run. Though Carl Stokes and Lawrence Bell, members of the City Council, declared for the race, local leaders were underwhelmed with the quality of declared candidates.|$|R
