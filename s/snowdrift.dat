5|$|For {{his next}} serial, Hergé planned to put {{together}} a story that caricatured the actions of Nazi Germany, developing the plot for King Ottokar's Sceptre. However, he temporarily set aside that project when he began to experience dreams of white and a car stuck in the snow, having ideas of sending Tintin to the north, considering Greenland or the Klondike as potential locations. The result was The Black Island, although Hergé only sent Tintin as far north as Scotland, and he instead used the idea of the car stuck in a <b>snowdrift</b> on a greetings card that he designed. He also had an idea of Tintin combating a group of anarchists bent on destroying Europe's iconic buildings, but again this idea did not make it into the eventual story. Having decided to set most of his story in Britain, Hergé briefly visited London and the southern English coast {{to learn more about the}} country. There, he purchased a stainless steel Gillotts Inqueduct G-2 pen, a type that he would continue to use throughout his life. His positive depiction of Britain was in part due to an Anglophilia that he had received from his childhood, with the British government having been a longstanding ally of Belgium, supporting its 1831 creation and liberating it from German occupation during the First World War.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the B-series trains were {{delivered}} for trial runs on 7 March 2001. In May, NSB stated {{that they would never}} be able to operate the trains with the speeds they had previously stated they could, and that at least for the next year, the tilting trains would operate at the same speeds as conventional trains. On 17 September 2001, the trains were put into service on the Bergen Line between Oslo and Bergen. During the following winter, the trains had problems running through <b>snowdrift</b> unless they were running at a sufficiently high speed. Because part of the Bergen Line had frost heave, trains were forced to drive extra slowly, causing trains to get stuck. NSB stated that tests had shown that Class 73 was better able to do this than El 16, which had previously been the main locomotive on the line, although Class 73 did not do as well as the modern El 18. In January 2002, NSB started rebuilding the A-series trains with a larger baggage compartment. This was largely because of insufficient space for passengers to take skis with them.|$|E

40|$|Australian alpine {{ecosystems}} {{are expected to}} diminish in extent as global warming intensifies. Alpine vegetation patterns {{are influenced by the}} duration of snow cover including the presence of <b>snowdrifts</b> in summer, but there is little quantitative information on landscape-scale relationships between vegetation patterns and the frequency of occurrence of persistent summer <b>snowdrifts</b> in the Australian alps. We mapped annual changes in summer <b>snowdrifts</b> in the Kosciuszko alpine region, Australia, from Landsat TM images and modelled the frequency of occurrence of persistent summer <b>snowdrifts</b> from long-term records (1954 – 2003) of winter snow depth. We then compared vegetation composition and structure among four classes that differed in the frequency of occurrence of persistent summer <b>snowdrifts.</b> We found a curvilinear relationship between annual winter snow depth and the area occupied by persistent <b>snowdrifts</b> in the following summer (r 2 = 0. 9756). Only 21 ha (0. 42 % of study area) was predicted to have supported summer <b>snowdrifts</b> in 80 % of the past 50 years, while 440 ha supported persistent summer snow in 10 % of years. Mean cover and species richness of vascular plants declined significantly, and species composition varied significantly, as the frequency of summer snow persistence increased. Cushion plants and rushes were most abundant where summer <b>snowdrifts</b> occurred most frequently, and shrubs, grasses and sedges were most abundant in areas that did not support <b>snowdrifts</b> in summer. The results demonstrate strong regional relationships between vegetation composition and structure and the frequency of occurrence of persistent summer <b>snowdrifts.</b> Reductions in winter snow depth due to global warming are expected to lead to substantial reductions in the extent of persistent summer <b>snowdrifts.</b> As a consequence, shrubs, grasses and sedges are predicted to expand at the expense of cushion plants and rushes, reducing landscape vegetation diversity. Fortunately, few vascular plant species (e. g. Ranunculus niphophilus) appear to be totally restricted to areas where summer snow occurs most frequently. The results from this study highlight potential indicator species that could be monitored to assess the effects of global warming on Australian alpine environments. <br /...|$|R

500|$|One of the {{earliest}} accounts of an ascent of Helvellyn {{for the pleasure of}} doing so is contained in James Clarke's guidebook of 1787. He quotes the account of an unnamed gentleman from Penrith who wanted to eat his dinner on Midsummer Day while sitting in a <b>snowdrift</b> on top of Helvellyn. The man left home at two in the morning, rode to Glencoyne and left his horse at a house in the valley there. He started to walk up the mountain at between four and five in the morning and after five hours hot and hard work he reached the snow and the summit. The snow was covered with dust so he had to dig for clean snow to eat with his dinner. He returned by a different route, reaching Glencoyne ten hours after leaving it. This story seems to reflect the colder climatic conditions of the eighteenth century, during the so-called [...] "Little Ice Age".|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to develop a new snow fence with the airfoil snow plates for the {{prevention}} of <b>snowdrifts</b> and improvement of visibility on roadways. The design was in accordance with aerodynamic principles, and its performance was evaluated in a wind tunnel test in which natural snow was used to simulate blowing-snow. In general, the <b>snowdrifts</b> and visibility blockage behind the snow fence was caused by the alternate rolling-up of the bottom gap flow and the shear layer separated from the top of snow fence. It was found that the alternate rolling-up of the bottom gap flow and the shear layer separated from the top of snow fence could be prevented by using airfoil snow plates. On the basis of this finding, the airfoil snow plates with an optimum configuration were designed for the prevention of alternate rolling-up of their flows. Consequently, the developed new type snow fence with the airfoil snow plates plates had a high performance in preventing <b>snowdrifts</b> and improving visibility in comparison with the conventional snow fence...|$|R
