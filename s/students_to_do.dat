5|$|What Lawrence {{needed to}} develop the idea was capable {{graduate}} <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the work. Edlefsen left to take up an assistant professorship in September 1930, and Lawrence replaced him with David H. Sloan and M. Stanley Livingston, who he set to work on developing Widerøe's accelerator and Edlefsen's cyclotron, respectively. Both had their own financial support. Both designs proved practical, and by May 1931, Sloan's linear accelerator was able to accelerate ions to 1 MeV. Livingston had a greater technical challenge, but when he applied 1,800V to his 11-inch cyclotron on January 2, 1931, he got 80,000-electron volt protons spinning around. A week later, he had 1.22 MeV with 3,000 V, more than enough for his PhD thesis on its construction.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of printing, written legal texts became more available, reducing the need for students to attend readings and lectures. However, {{this meant that the}} students denied themselves the opportunity to query what they had learnt or discuss it in greater detail. Eventually, students now had a way to learn without attending lectures, they began to excuse themselves from lectures, meetings and moots altogether; in the early 17th century they developed a way of deputising other <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> their moots for them. The Benchers and Readers did little to arrest the decline of the practice of lecturers and readings, first because many probably believed (as the students did) that books were an adequate substitute, and secondly because many were keen to avoid the work of preparing a reading, which cut into their time as practising barristers. These problems were endemic to all the Inns, not just Gray's Inn.|$|E

Students must complete a winter term project three years out of their four in the College of Arts and Sciences. Projects range from serious academic research with co-authorship in scientific journals, to humanitarian projects, to making avant-garde films about historic Chicago neighborhoods, to learning how to bartend. A full-credit project is suggested to involve five to six hours per weekday.|$|E
25|$|Titchener {{presented}} Boring {{with his}} first opportunity not only to teach but also to practice writing {{about the history of}} experimental psychology. Titchener wanted to redesign a systematic psychology course and enlisted his graduate <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the job. It was a large task; the course covered the entire history of psychology in 3 lectures a week for 2 years. Boring {{and the rest of the}} team read through German literature on experimental psychology and many other primary sources of information to complete this project. The finished product was a 200-lecture course. The task sparked Boring's interest in the history that shaped the field; it would also serve as great training for Boring's later publication of his own text, The History of Experimental Psychology, in 1929. The work also gave Boring experience in teaching psychology. He continued to teach psychology at Cornell for 4 years but was glad when the war forced him to leave this position, as he felt that Cornell did not need him.|$|E
500|$|Hack (1982) was {{developed}} by Jay Fenlason with help from Kenny Woodland, Mike Thome, and Jonathan Payne, students at Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School at the time, while participating in the school's computer lab overseen by Brian Harvey. Harvey {{had been able to}} acquire a PDP-11/7 minicomputer for the school and instituted a course curriculum that allowed <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> whatever they wanted on the computers, including playing games, as long as they had completed assignments by the end of each semester. Fenlason, Woodland, Thome, and Payne met through these courses and became a close-group of friends and competent programmers. Harvey had invited the group to the computer labs at UC Berkeley where they had the opportunity to use the mainframe systems there, and were introduced to Rogue, inspiring them to create their own version as their class project. Fenlason had created a list of features they wanted to improve upon in Rogue such as having a level's layout saved once the player moved off that level. [...] They approached Toy and Arnold at a local USENIX conference for the source code to Rogue, but were refused, forcing them to develop the routines from scratch. The resulting program, Hack, stayed true to the original Dungeons and Dragons influences, and derived its name from being both a [...] "hack and slash" [...] game as well as a programming hack to recreate Rogue without having access to its source code. Fenlason was not able to include all the desired features, and his involvement in Hacks development concluded after the students had left the school. Fenlason had provided the source code to Hack to the USENIX conferences to be distributed on their digital tapes, from which it was later discovered and built upon through USENET newsgroups, porting it to various systems. Like Angband, the maintainership of the Hack code passed through several hands, and some variants were created by different forks.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{students}} {{choose to}} [...] "fast track" [...] their math courses taking Algebra 2 Pre-AP and Pre-Calculus Pre-AP as sophomores thus {{allowing them to}} take AP Calculus BC as seniors.

2500|$|Linear algebra first {{appeared}} in American graduate textbooks in the 1940s and in undergraduate textbooks in the 1950s. Following work by the School Mathematics Study Group, U.S. high schools asked 12th grade <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> [...] "matrix algebra, formerly reserved for college" [...] in the 1960s. [...] In France during the 1960s, educators attempted to teach linear algebra through finite-dimensional vector spaces {{in the first year}} of secondary school. This was met with a backlash in the 1980s that removed linear algebra from the curriculum. In 1993, the U.S.-based Linear Algebra Curriculum Study Group recommended that undergraduate linear algebra courses be given an application-based [...] "matrix orientation" [...] as opposed to a theoretical orientation.|$|E
2500|$|Hutner {{developed}} {{a style of}} celebrating Shabbat and the Jewish holidays by delivering a type of discourse known as a ma'amar. It {{was a combination of}} Talmudic discourse, Hasidic celebration (tish), philosophic lecture, group singing, and when possible, like on Purim, a ten-piece band was brought in as accompaniment. Many times there was singing and dancing all night. All of this, together with the respect to his authority that he demanded, induced in his students an obedience and something of a [...] "heightened consciousness" [...] that passed into their lives transforming them into literal Hasidim of their rosh yeshiva, who in turn encouraged this by eventually personally donning Hasidic garb (levush) and behaving like something of a synthesis between a rosh yeshiva and a rebbe. He also instructed some of his <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> likewise.|$|E

2500|$|Following C. W. Woodworth and William E. Castle, around 1908 Morgan {{started working}} on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and {{encouraging}} <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so as well. With Fernandus Payne, he mutated Drosophila through physical, chemical, and radiational means. He began cross-breeding experiments to find heritable mutations, {{but they had no}} significant success for two years. [...] Castle had also had difficulty identifying mutations in Drosophila, which were tiny. Finally in 1909, a series of heritable mutants appeared, some of which displayed Mendelian inheritance patterns; in 1910 Morgan noticed a white-eyed mutant male among the red-eyed wild types. When white-eyed flies were bred with a red-eyed female, their progeny were all red-eyed. A second generation cross produced white-eyed males—a sex-linked recessive trait, the gene for which Morgan named white. Morgan also discovered a pink-eyed mutant that showed a different pattern of inheritance. In a paper published in Science in 1911, he concluded that (1) some traits were sex-linked, (2) the trait was probably carried on one of the sex chromosomes, and (3) other genes were probably carried on specific chromosomes as well.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the primary}} school level, {{students}} spend all class {{time with their}} peers, but receive extra material to challenge them. Enrichment may {{be as simple as}} a modified assignment provided by the regular classroom teacher, or it might include formal programs such as Odyssey of the Mind, Destination Imagination or academic competitions such as Brain Bowl, Future Problem Solving, Science Olympiad, National History Day, science fairs, or spelling bees. Programmes of enrichment activities may also be organised outside the school day (e.g. the ASCEND project in secondary science education [...] ). This work is done in addition to, and not instead of, any regular school work assigned. Critics of this approach argue that it requires gifted <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> more work instead of the same amount at an advanced level. On the secondary school level sometimes an option is to take more courses like English, Spanish, Latin, Philosophy, Science, etc., or to engage in extra curricular activities. [...] Some perceive there to be a necessary choice between enrichment and acceleration, as if the two were mutually exclusive alternatives. [...] However, other researchers see the two as complements to each other.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "mystery" [...] {{surrounding}} his origins and accent is clarified in Oliver Daniel's 1000-page biography Stokowski – A Counterpoint of View (1982), in which (in Chapter 12) Daniel reveals Stokowski {{came under the}} influence of his first wife, pianist Olga Samaroff. Samaroff, born [...] Lucy Mary Agnes Hickenlooper, was from Galveston, Texas, and adopted a more exotic-sounding name to further her career. For professional and career reasons, she [...] "urged him to emphasize only the Polish part of his background" [...] once he became a resident of the United States. He studied at the Royal College of Music, where he first enrolled in 1896 at the age of thirteen, making him one of the youngest <b>students</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. In his later life in the US, Stokowski would perform six of the nine symphonies composed by his fellow organ student Ralph Vaughan Williams. Stokowski sang in the choir of the St Marylebone Parish Church, and later he became the assistant organist to Sir Walford Davies at The Temple Church. By age 16, Stokowski was elected to a membership in the Royal College of Organists. In 1900, he formed the choir of St. Mary's Church, Charing Cross Road, where he trained the choirboys and played the organ. In 1902, he was appointed the organist and choir director of St. James's Church, Piccadilly. He also attended The Queen's College, Oxford, where he earned a Bachelor of Music degree in 1903.|$|E
