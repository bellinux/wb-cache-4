25|$|A {{variation}} on tweening {{is used by}} a very successful and well-known bowler, Pete Weber, who is considered a power <b>stroker.</b> This term refers to a bowler who relies on a high backswing and open shoulders to generate potential ball speed and a big hook, but uses the timing of a <b>stroker.</b> It {{can also be used}} to describe a <b>stroker</b> with a high rev rate, or a cranker with an unusually smooth release. A power stroker's release is both smooth and powerful, generating many revolutions via a wrist snap or flick of the fingers, without muscling the armswing. Some other famous power strokers include Bryan Goebel, Wes Malott, Doug Kent (often considered a tweener), and Chris Barnes (often considered a <b>stroker).</b>|$|E

25|$|Although crankers {{are often}} {{considered}} to be more impressive to watch, strokers are often considered to have more repeatable and accurate shots. Strokers rely on smooth ball placement more than kinetic energy to fell pins.

Other famous strokers include PBA Hall of Famers Norm Duke, David Ozio, and Dick Weber.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the sport}} of ten-pin bowling, there are many {{different}} ways in which to deliver (known as a [...] "throw" [...] or [...] "roll") the bowling ball in order to advance it toward the pins in an accurate and powerful manner. Generally, there are three basic forms of 10-pin bowling. The most basic form is known as stroking, which is the most classic form. The most powerful form is known as cranking, which imparts great leverage and maximum rotation on the ball, but sacrifices accuracy. In between the two is the domain of the tweener, who has characteristics of both, but does not truly fit into either category. A well-known variant of [...] "tweening" [...] is the power <b>stroker.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Strokers often {{keep their}} {{shoulders}} square to {{the foul line}} and their backswing generally does not go much above parallel to the ground. This type of delivery reduces the ball's rate of revolution, thus decreasing its hook potential and hitting power. Strokers rely on finesse and accuracy, as opposed to crankers, who use speed and power. However, today's modern reactive resin bowling balls now allow strokers to hit the [...] "pocket" [...] at a relatively high angle. [...] Stroking is considered the most classic of all the bowling forms and {{is still the most}} popular style of bowling in the PBA. Walter Ray Williams, Jr., the PBA's all-time leader in titles and earnings, is a <b>stroker.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The group {{formed as}} the vocal ensemble, the Echoes, in 1952, when {{the band members}} were {{enrolled}} in Edmond Meany Junior High School, and performed in a local teen club called the <b>Strokers,</b> among other venues. Initially, the band went through several personnel changes, but the solidified line-up included Jimmy Pipkin (lead vocals, piano), Bobby Dixon (first tenor), [...] "Tiny" [...] Tony Smith (second tenor), and Ernie Rouse (baritone). In 1957, the group, now going by the moniker, the Gallahads, performed their original tune, [...] "Gone", over the telephone to DJ Steve Wray. Impressed, Wray became the band's first manager, buying them matching white outfits, and arranging performances at the Catholic Youth Organization --which were, at the time, some of the only teen dances allowed in Seattle. In one of their gigs, record producers Larry Nelson and Chuck Markulis, owners of Nite Records, saw the Gallahads and immediately signed the band, after recently issuing the label's debut record, [...] "Love You So", by Ron Holden and the Thunderbirds.|$|R
5000|$|Turn {{the volume}} up loud enough while {{listening}} to opening track ‘Siisx’ and you’ll hear unmistakable white noise. A mistake or recording problem? Not likely, nothing is an accident with these two virtuosos. Clicks, taps, clacks and taps skitter across the soundscape as Ryuichi’s expertly knocks away at the ebony and ivory. Don’t be surprised if you feel your throat tighten and a frosty sensation spread through your anterior lobes. Music? Art? Whatever it is this is less about listening and more about feeling. ... This isn’t by any means an album to let loose and rock out to. In fact it is a refreshing change from all the electro sounds Tiefschwarz et al are dressing up as click, glitch and minimal. Play this at a party and you’ll be hung, drawn and quartered but turn it up at the next {{annual meeting of the}} chin <b>strokers</b> society and you’ll be hailed a hero. By all means listen to this CD numerous times but just be careful because there is a reason the album is only three songs long. Any more of this cleverly crafted masterpiece and you’d never want to waste your time with any of that other stuff posing as music.|$|R

As reported by Nigel Colett Jiand khan was leading the resistance until he got arrested and was replaced by his nephew (Shaswar Khan) who became the head of the tribe and continued to lead the resistance. The war lasted for 6 years from 1928-1934. Philip Carl Salzman summarizes [...] the pacification of western Baluchistan [...] "Reza Shah then {{turned his attention to the}} most remote region claimed to be part of Iran, Baluchistan. An army was sent in 1928 and succeeded, with the help of artillery and primitive bombing from early aircraft, in pacifying all of Baluchistan, except for the Sarhad. Led by the Yarahmadzai, who had earlier fought the British, the sarhadi tribes resisted successfully, until finally settling and accepting the suzerainty of the Persian crown in 1935". The Yarahmadzais were defeated but not forcibly settled. As result of the pacification the Yarahmadzai lost their tribal name and becoming the Shah Navazi(Shah <b>strokers)</b> while Ismaeilzais becoming Shah Baksh(Shahs Pardon).|$|R
