25|$|An {{important}} {{benefit of}} an ETF is the stock-like features offered. A mutual fund is bought or {{sold at the}} end of a day's trading, whereas ETFs can be traded whenever the market is open. Since ETFs trade on the market, investors can carry out the same types of trades that they can with a stock. For instance, investors can sell <b>short,</b> <b>use</b> a limit order, use a stop-loss order, buy on margin, and invest as much or as little money as they wish (there is no minimum investment requirement). Also, many ETFs have the capability for options (puts and calls) to be written against them. Covered call strategies allow investors and traders to potentially increase their returns on their ETF purchases by collecting premiums (the proceeds of a call sale or write) on calls written against them. Mutual funds do not offer those features.|$|E

50|$|The {{disposable}} {{version of}} the OV-chipkaart (Dutch: eenmalige chipkaart or wegwerpkaart) is made of thick paper, suitable for <b>short</b> <b>use.</b> It can only be used for simple travel products (such as single or return journeys on trains or unlimited travel on a city or regional network for {{a certain period of}} time). Since it cannot be topped up with credit, it is not usable as a stored-value card. Disposable tickets are intended for passengers who use public transport infrequently. Journey fares are normally higher when travelling on a disposable chipcard rather than on a reusable (anonymous or personal) OV-chipkaart.|$|E
5000|$|Datings by dendrochronology, {{have found}} the wood used for the constructions to have been felled {{in the fall of}} 980 AD and {{subsequently}} used for building, presumably in the spring of 981 AD. The rather short construction time and the complete lack of any signs of maintenance, indicate an only <b>short</b> <b>use</b> of the buildings of no more than perhaps 10-15 years. Parts of the fortress, such as the outer eastern rampart was probably never completed before the site was abandoned. Archaeological finds shows that Trelleborg was under attack at some point, resulting in several dead soldiers and signs of fire, suggests the castle might have been destroyed by fire. The regions around the gates show signs of longer usage though.|$|E

50|$|Datings by {{dendrochronology}} {{have found}} the wood used {{for the construction of}} Trelleborg (near Slagelse) to have been felled in the autumn of 980 and thus being used for building presumedly in the spring of 981. The rather short construction time and the complete lack of any signs of maintenance indicate an only <b>short</b> <b>use</b> of the buildings, maybe five years but hardly more than twenty. The others have been dated to roughly the same time. Fyrkat may be a little older, Aggersborg somewhat younger. Not enough has been found at the other sites for a precise dating but the construction and layout of the trelleborgs at Slagelse, Fyrkat, Aggersborg, Nonnebakken under Odense and the fort under modern Trelleborg in Sweden is so similar that it is believed most probable that they were conceived by a single mind.|$|E

5000|$|In 2006 News Corporation {{acquired}} 35% of {{the stock}} and began a major overhaul of the programming. The revised channel, with a new logo and a more mainstream target group, launched on October 28, 2007. The new logo consisted of the word [...] "PULS" [...] which was made by a typeface called VERSO and it was coloured red but on the same day, TV Puls began broadcasting a new information program: Puls Raport. But on July 16, 2008, {{it was decided to}} remove the program from the schedule. The reason for this decision was the poor audience share results and the excessively high costs of production. However, its VERSO typeface logo was short-lived, because this logo was never successful and is remaining a <b>short</b> <b>use</b> in 11 months. In September 2008, TV Puls' 2007 rebrand was retired in use and TV Pulsa adopted a new logo which consisted of a bar which was coloured in silver and orange. The silver bar is thin and short because it bears the word [...] "TV". The orange bar is fat and long because it carries the word [...] "Puls".

5000|$|In Symphony No. 2 in D major, many of {{the same}} {{influences}} can be found despite its being composed nearly 25 years after his First. Lindblad employs many stylistic qualities found in late Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven. When listening to the work, one can hear a <b>short</b> <b>use</b> of a motif similar to the four-note motif of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. The second movement brings a dance-like quality that could have been influenced by Haydn's ‚Äúwalking‚Äù themes with a hint of Romanticism. The [...] "Scherzo" [...] can be argued to be evoking Schumann. In the final movement of Symphony No. 2, Lindblad expresses an appreciation for Mozart by quoting Cherubino's aria from Le nozze di Figaro. Lindblad's style of orchestration has been praised as excellent, despite Lindblad's not being known to have seriously studied proper orchestration technique. [...] Lindblad's song style can be compared to the lieder styles of Schubert, Schumann, and Brahms in that many of Lindblad's songs are ‚Äústrophic or built on a pattern of two contrasting stanzas which return more or less varied.‚Äù However, Lindblad composed {{in a way that made}} the music stand apart from those other lieder traditions. Without resorting to traditional Swedish folk tunes as a basis for his songs, he was able to color them in a way that is described as genuinely Swedish. Lindblad is credited with being the innovator of the ‚ÄúSwedish style‚Äù of song. Performing Swedish lieder in a manner that sounds true to the style demands a certain amount of attention to the nuances of the language and the interpretation.|$|E
