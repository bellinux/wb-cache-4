The settlement price (or rate) is called spot price (or spot rate). A <b>spot</b> <b>contract</b> is in contrast with a forward contract or futures contract where contract terms are agreed now but delivery and payment will occur at a future date.|$|E

40|$|Thi spaper is {{concerned}} with the risk-allocation effects of alternative types of contracts used to set the price of a good tobe delivered in the future. Under a fixed price contract, the price is specified in advance. Under a <b>spot</b> price <b>contract,</b> the price is the price prevailing in the spot market at the time of delivery. These contract forms are examined {{in the context of a}} market in which sellers have uncertain production costs and buyers have uncertain valuations. The paper derives and interprets a general condition determining which contract form would be preferred when the seller and/or the buyer is risk averse. In addition, an example is provided in which a <b>spot</b> price <b>contract</b> with a floor price is superior both to a "pure" <b>spot</b> price <b>contract</b> and a fixed price contract. ...|$|R

The purchase is made at the <b>spot</b> <b>contract</b> rate. Retail customers will be charged, {{in the form of}} commission or otherwise, to cover the provider's costs and generate a profit. One form of charge is the use of an exchange rate that is less favourable than the wholesale spot rate.

5000|$|In finance, {{a forward}} {{contract}} {{or simply a}} forward is a non-standardized contract between two parties to buy or to sell an asset at a specified future time at a price agreed upon today, making it a type of derivative instrument. [...] This {{is in contrast to}} a <b>spot</b> <b>contract,</b> which is an agreement to buy or sell an asset on its spot date, which may vary depending on the instrument, for example most of the FX contracts have Spot Date two business days from today. The party agreeing to buy the underlying asset in the future assumes a long position, and the party agreeing to sell the asset in the future assumes a short position. The price agreed upon is called the delivery price, which is equal to the forward price at the time the contract is entered into.The price of the underlying instrument, in whatever form, is paid before control of the instrument changes. This {{is one of the many}} forms of buy/sell orders where the time and date of trade is not the same as the value date where the securities themselves are exchanged.|$|E

Regulatory uncertainty and equity markets have previously been proven to impact the volatility of the REC <b>spot</b> <b>contract.</b> As policy makers, renewable electricity investors and other stakeholders aim for profitability and efficient regulation, additional insights of the dynamics in the  REC market is needed. This study examines regulatory uncertainty on both REC spot  contract and forward contracts by estimating breakpoints on GARCH variance using the  Bai-Perron (1998) procedure. Spillover  effects from Brent Crude Oil, OSEBX and OMXS 30 to the REC contracts are estimated using the Cross-Correlation Function. Significant break points linked to regulatory  events in the market are found {{in all of the}}  REC contracts. The REC <b>spot</b> <b>contract</b> is  found to be independent of Brent Crude Oil but affected by the OSEBX and OMXS 30. Significant spillovers from Brent Crude Oil and equity markets are found in all of the forward contracts...|$|E

The employer provides incentives at lower cost using deferred compensation.|$|E

40|$|An imperfectly {{competitive}} {{model of}} processor (packer) behavior is formulated to estimate welfare effects from restricting alternative marketing arrangements of livestock procured by packers. Pork was aggregated into a composite good and hog supply was partitioned into negotiated (<b>spot),</b> <b>contract,</b> and packer-owned. The model was estimated with the dynamic SUR method using weekly Mandatory Price Reporting (MPR) hog and pork data from 2001 to 2005. The model incorporates production uncertainty by modeling expected pork output as expected output in the input demand functions. The welfare effects from banning packer-owned hogs indicate that independent producers, consumers, and packers all would lose. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E

30|$|From a {{theoretical}} point of view, the institutionalist approach explains {{the choice of}} autonomous companies to adopt coordination mechanism, starting from imperfections in the transmission of information. In the presence of opportunistic behaviors and limited rationality of the agents, the mechanisms that regulate information transmission are characterized by making incomplete <b>spot</b> <b>contracts</b> (Akerlof 1970; Stiglitz 1987; Hart and Moore 1990; Williamson 1996; Mènard 2004). According to this approach, the more these factors are relevant, the more transaction costs increase (usage costs of the market) {{and the company is}} incentivized to seek stable forms of coordination, up to the full coordination one (hierarchical/proprietary integration).|$|R
40|$|When {{firm-specific}} {{human capital}} is involved, both the worker and the employer have {{the incentive to}} prespecify future wages. This incentive arises from transaction costs associated with <b>spot</b> <b>contracts</b> and from opportunistic bargaining which may occur during the postinvestment period. In prespecifying wages the parties may use economic indicators to estimate productivities. To the extent that such indicators are less than perfect measures of true productivities, some wage rigidity will occur. Wage rigidity causes resource loss of various types. This article analyzes various contractual arrangements designed to minimize such a loss, and discusses potentially testable implications. ...|$|R

Since Simon (1951), economics defines authority as the opportunity for the employer to postpone {{the selection of the}} tasks the employee should perform. This paper shows that these definitions do not fit. It proposes to use the framework of option pricing in order to interpret Simon’s model and to analyze the economic conceptions of authority, flexibility and renegotiation. When states are not verifiable, the economic concept of employment contract is a specific case of the broader set of sale contracts. It can be formalized as a <b>spot</b> <b>contract</b> paired with a call option on the worker tasks. Therefore, the economic formalization of the employment contract does not implement what lawyers define as an employment relationship. The economic formalization of the subordination notion used by Law is still to be done. ...|$|E
40|$|Next-Generation Networks are {{increasingly}} ubiquitous {{and one of}} the challenges users face is the lack of a convenient mechanism and standards to access every day services. Dynamic pricing, which changes according to context and demand, and ad-hoc engagement with network services providers, are solutions in the right direction. This paper continues the exploration of a user-oriented pricing approach for next-generation networks where pricing for services will not be governed by long-term agreements but will be based on ad-hoc usage (policy-dependent), short-term agreements and spot-pricing (and payment). Based on the usage, the users will make decisions on what to pay and who to pay for the best service they require. These new approaches allows multiple competing access providers to dynamically determine prices for services, broadcasts those tariffs and automatically negotiate a <b>spot</b> <b>contract</b> with a software agent running on the user´s device.
