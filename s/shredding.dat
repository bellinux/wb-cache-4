5|$|A tidal {{disruption}} {{event of}} this sort is when a star interacts with a supermassive black hole <b>shredding</b> the star, {{and in some cases}} creating a relativistic jet which produces bright emission of gamma ray radiation. The event GRB 110328A (also denoted Swift J1644+57) was initially argued to be produced by the disruption of a main sequence star by a black hole of several million times the mass of the Sun, although it has subsequently been argued that the disruption of a white dwarf by a black hole of mass about 10 thousand times the Sun may be more likely.|$|E

5|$|Arthur Andersen {{was charged}} with and found guilty of {{obstruction}} of justice for <b>shredding</b> the thousands of documents and deleting e-mails and company files that tied the firm to its audit of Enron. Although {{only a small number of}} Arthur Andersen's employees were involved with the scandal, the firm was effectively put out of business; the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons. The company surrendered its CPA license on August 31, 2002, and 85,000 employees lost their jobs. The conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court due to the jury not being properly instructed on the charge against Andersen. The Supreme Court ruling theoretically left Andersen free to resume operations. However, the damage to the Andersen name has been so great that it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.|$|E

40|$|Scrap tire {{stockpiles}} {{have grown}} in the United States leading to a significant disposal problem. The most recent {{survey conducted by the}} Scrap Tire Management Council reported that 850 million tires are stockpiled in the United States, with an additional 250 million tires still generated each year (1995). The research described herein was undertaken to develop design guidelines for <b>shredded</b> tire stream crossings. The shear strength properties have been investigated for tire <b>shreds</b> as well as tire <b>shreds</b> in contact with glacial till. The <b>shredded</b> tires range from 40 mm to 1. 4 m in length. There are several documented cases where <b>shredded</b> tires have been used successfully as drainage structures. Most of these projects make use of tire chips or <b>shreds</b> ranging from 13 to 152 mm in size. Since production costs for larger-size <b>shreds</b> are significantly less, they offer a distinct advantage over the smaller shreds.;This study uses large scale direct shear tests to investigate the shear strength of large-size tire <b>shreds.</b> Like other studies conducted on tire <b>shreds,</b> Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion is used to interpret laboratory results. This study concludes that for pure tire <b>shreds,</b> no correlation appears to exist between the size of tire <b>shreds</b> and Mohr-Coulomb failure parameters. At higher normal stresses, this study shows that the Mohr-Coulomb failure envelope in not linear, indicating that Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion may not be not accurate over a large stress range in interpreting the shear strength of tire <b>shreds.</b> This study concludes that the shear strength of <b>shredded</b> tires can be interpreted with the relationship: [Tau]= 1. 4 [Sigma] 0 Â· 79.

Sacks drains the turtles blood in order to create mutagen so that he can complete he and Shredder's plan: <b>Shredder</b> will release a virus across the city and Sacks will sell the mutagen as a cure for the disease making him even more rich. As <b>Shredder</b> prepares to release the virus, the turtles escape and confront him. Although <b>Shredder</b> nearly defeats them, the turtles were able to defeat him with the help of April, which causes <b>Shredder</b> to fall from the building he was on. <b>Shredder</b> survives the fall and is shown to have a sample of the mutagen.|$|R

5000|$|In City at War, {{due to the}} {{injuries}} he sustained from Splinter, <b>Shredder</b> has been confined to a hospital bed {{under the care of}} Stockman with Bebop and Rocksteady as his bodyguards. When Tiger Claw returns to report the loss of an entire weapons cache thanks to the Turtles and Karai back in Manhattan, making it clear Karai wants to take <b>Shredder</b> down one piece at a time by destroying his criminal empire before taking him out, <b>Shredder</b> decrees that if it's a war Karai wants, it's a war she'll get, before Stockman hooks an I.V. filled with mutagen up to <b>Shredder,</b> and as the mutagen is injected into <b>Shredder,</b> his eyes open wide as the mutagen takes effect. In The Insecta Trifecta, <b>Shredder</b> is still receiving the mutagen drip as he now turns to Stockman as his last hope due to his undying loyalty since Tiger Claw and the others have become useless as of late in stopping Karai and the Turtles. When Stockman returns to report his mission a failure, <b>Shredder</b> is not worried about it, revealing to Stockman that his mutagen drip is finally taking effect as <b>Shredder</b> deploys a pair of blades {{from the back of his}} hand, right out of the skin itself. In [...] "The Super Shredder" [...] <b>Shredder</b> forces Stockman to give him the rest of the mutagen drip, which mutated him into his Super <b>Shredder</b> form, although it ended up monstrous he was still pleased. <b>Shredder</b> then collects his henchmen and travels back to his old lair. Karai tries to fight the <b>Shredder</b> along with Shinigami but <b>Shredder</b> easily knocks Shinigami unconscious and he escapes with Karai. He then notices a van coming straight towards him, (The Shell Raiser) and flips it over. He tells the turtles to have splinter meet him at the place that he last beat him. <b>Shredder</b> then sets the vehicle on fire and the turtles flee to the sewers. <b>Shredder</b> then creates a trap for Splinter and the Turtles, which is full of photos of Splinter, Tang Shen, and Karai. When Splinter enters he drops bars of iron to avoid them from escaping. He then light fire towards them but they jump underwater. As the Turtles, Splinter, and April continue to approach <b>Shredder,</b> Karai makes a remark and Splinter follows, but later finds out he was led into another trap. <b>Shredder</b> forces Splinter to fight him but Splinter escapes, ready to set up a plan of his own. Splinter leads <b>Shredder</b> to the Undercity, where he puts his plan into action. <b>Shredder</b> eventually finds Splinter and he steps on his tail. <b>Shredder</b> then takes Splinter deeper into the UnderCity, where he decides to finish him. Just as <b>Shredder</b> was about to strike Splinter, his arm started to lose control, causing him to step back. Splinter then throws a blade at a few gas tanks and both Splinter and <b>Shredder</b> fall to their deaths. However, in the following episode, [...] "Darkest Plight", <b>Shredder</b> and Splinter are separated during the fall, and <b>Shredder</b> returns to the top of the Under-city to be rescued by Tiger Claw, who takes him back to recover before hunting down the Turtles. While Tiger Claw deals with April and Karai, <b>Shredder</b> goes after Leonardo, and nearly crushes him to death before Karai and April arrive to help. During the battle, <b>Shredder</b> tosses a wrecked fuel tanker semi-truck at Karai, only for April to catch it in her psychic grip, causing her Sol Star crystal to cause her eyes to glow blue and smile malevolently before hurling it back at <b>Shredder.</b> However, before <b>Shredder</b> can kill Leo, Karai pleads with him to reconsider doing something good in his life instead of being consumed by his vengeance. This lures <b>Shredder</b> in close enough for Karai to hit him in his most vulnerable spot: His exposed, pulsating mutated heart. Weakened, <b>Shredder</b> is saved by Tiger Claw, who drives him back to their hideout, where <b>Shredder</b> demands a larger dose of the mutagen from Stockman. When Tiger Claw objects, knowing it is too dangerous, <b>Shredder</b> overpowers him, forces Stockman to administer the dosage and roars as the mutagen takes effect as Tiger Claw watches in horror and fear. In [...] "Tale of Tiger Claw", he is shown as a M.O.U.S.E.R. hologram to warn Tiger Claw of his next move against Splinter.|$|R
