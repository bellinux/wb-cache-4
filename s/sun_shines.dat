25|$|Sanford Stadium {{is one of}} the few college stadiums, and one of {{only two}} in the Southeastern Conference, in which the {{football}} field is oriented to face east–west as opposed to north–south (the other is Commonwealth Stadium; both stadiums are oriented in a general northwest–southeast direction). Many of UGA's opponents have found it difficult for players to see as the west end zone is still open and the <b>sun</b> <b>shines</b> in the faces of the players, although both teams face the sun during the game.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Sun</b> <b>Shines</b> Bright (1953), Ford's first {{entry in}} the Cannes Film Festival, was a western comedy-drama with Charles Winninger {{reviving}} the Judge Priest role made famous by Will Rogers in the 1930s. Ford later {{referred to it as}} one of his favorites, but it was poorly received, and was drastically cut (from 90 mins to 65 mins) by Republic soon after its release, with some excised scenes now presumed lost. It fared poorly at the box office and its failure contributed to the subsequent collapse of Argosy Pictures.|$|E

25|$|After sailing {{for three}} days from Iceland, Bjarni {{receives}} unfavorable weather, north winds and fog and loses his bearing. After several days of bad weather the <b>sun</b> <b>shines</b> again and Bjarni reaches a wooded land. Realizing that it isn't Greenland, Bjarni decides not to go ashore and sets sail away. Bjarni finds two more lands but neither of them matches the descriptions he had heard of Greenland so he does not go ashore despite the curiosity of his sailors. Eventually the ship does reach Greenland and Bjarni settles in Herjolfsnes.|$|E
25|$|At mid-latitudes, the F2 layer daytime ion {{production}} {{is higher in}} the summer, as expected, since the <b>Sun</b> <b>shines</b> more directly on the Earth. However, there are seasonal changes in the molecular-to-atomic ratio of the neutral atmosphere that cause the summer ion loss rate to be even higher. The {{result is that the}} increase in the summertime loss overwhelms the increase in summertime production, and total F2 ionization is actually lower in the local summer months. This effect is known as the winter anomaly. The anomaly is always present in the northern hemisphere, but is usually absent in the southern hemisphere during periods of low solar activity.|$|E
25|$|In Tarbes, fog {{and strong}} winds are rare. These climate {{characteristics}} of Tarbes {{are found in}} the north of the department, but with more fog in winter, and warmer daytime temperatures and lower precipitation in the summer. Conversely on the closer terrain the average quantities of precipitation increase. This varies greatly depending on exposure and slopes, but become abundant near the border ridges. The area between plain and mountain has a more humid climate and less sunny {{than the rest of the}} department. In the mountains the <b>sun</b> <b>shines</b> frequently above a sea of clouds and the wind blows stronger and more often than on the plain (breezes and sometimes very strong winds from the south).|$|E

The scene switches to The Phantom's underground domain where he has kidnapped Christine in his boat and ties her to a post at his mist-shrouded dock before rowing slowly back into the darkness, leaving Christine behind ("Somewhere Above The <b>Sun</b> <b>Shines</b> Bright").|$|E
25|$|In 1998, de Klerk and {{his wife}} of 38 years, Marike de Klerk, were {{divorced}} following the discovery of his affair with Elita Georgiades, then the wife of Tony Georgiades, a Greek shipping tycoon who had allegedly given de Klerk and the NP financial support. Soon after his divorce, de Klerk and Georgiades were married. His divorce and remarriage scandalised conservative South African opinion, especially among the Calvinist Afrikaners. In 1999, his autobiography, The Last Trek – A New Beginning, was published. In 2001, following {{the murder of his}} former wife, the manuscript of her own autobiography, A Place Where the <b>Sun</b> <b>Shines</b> Again, was submitted to de Klerk, who urged the publishers to suppress a chapter dealing with his infidelity.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason for}} the unusual clarity of {{tropical}} waters is they are deficient in nutrients and drifting plankton. Further, the <b>sun</b> <b>shines</b> year-round in the tropics, warming the surface layer, making it less dense than subsurface layers. The warmer water is separated from deeper, cooler water by a stable thermocline, where the temperature makes a rapid change. This keeps the warm surface waters floating above the cooler deeper waters. In {{most parts of the}} ocean, there is little exchange between these layers. Organisms that die in aquatic environments generally sink to the bottom, where they decompose, which releases nutrients in the form of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K). These nutrients are necessary for plant growth, but in the tropics, they do not directly return to the surface.|$|E

25|$|Wheldrake is in {{the more}} northerly part of England and {{although}} it has a typically English temperate climate which {{is influenced by the}} warming effect of the Gulf Stream, it is slightly cooler than London. In the summer months the average maximum temperature is 20°C and the minimum is 11°C. In the winter the average maximum is 7°C and the minimum is 2°C. Average monthly precipitation varies between 68mm in August and 37mm in March. In May, June and July the <b>sun</b> <b>shines</b> for an average of six hours a day but in January and February there is an average of only one hour of sunshine.

500|$|The {{canvas of}} The Magpie depicts a solitary black magpie {{perched on a}} gate formed in a wattle fence, as {{the light of the}} <b>sun</b> <b>shines</b> upon freshly fallen snow {{creating}} blue shadows. [...] The painting features one of the first examples of Monet's use of colored shadows, which would later become associated with the Impressionist movement. Monet and the Impressionists used colored shadows to represent the actual, changing conditions of light and shadow as seen in nature, challenging the academic convention of painting shadows black. This subjective theory of color perception was introduced to the art world through the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Michel Eugène Chevreul earlier in the century.|$|E
