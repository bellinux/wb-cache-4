40|$|The central {{question}} {{in this research}} project is the following: how was literature written by authors who {{are said to be}} mad  outsider literature  spoken about {{in the second half of}} the twentieth century in Dutch and French literary discourse? Which are the discursive conditions that enable the fact that we can speak (in a specific way) about outsider literature? With this research project, I attempt to analyze the attitude towards madness, as a biographic characteristic attributed to an author, and the way it evolved. How do literary critics write about authors said to be mad? With what kind of terminology do literary scholars approach their texts? How do authors present themselves as mad? Discourse analysis, and more specifically Michel Foucaults archeology, is used as methodological perspective. Insights stemming from a broad range of literary and cultural theories are integrated into this framework. Because of the emphasis on discourse, literature and madness, the oeuvre of Foucault not only functions as methodological perspective, but is also present as a highly intriguing case (and in particular his Histoire de la folie). In this study, four <b>significant</b> <b>anthologies</b> presenting outsider literature are analyzed: Gedoemde dichters (Paul Rodenko, 1957), Écrits bruts (Michel Thévoz, 1979), Les fous littéraires (André Blavier, 1982) and Gestoorde teksten (Jacq Vogelaar, 1983). The selection criteria used by the anthologists and the way they present the selected texts are discussed. This analysis leads up to a clear image of the dispersion of the concept of madness (and literature). Subsequently, this dissertation focuses on the discourse surrounding four different mad authors, all having a singular profile and permitting a geographical, linguistic and temporal variation in the case studies. The reception of Jan Arends (1925 - 1974) has a complex relation to the anti-psychiatric current that became popular during the 1970 s. At the beginning of the decade, Arends became an author with a mythical and mad kind of profile. Both biographical anecdotes as well as his ego-documents took in a crucial place in the image of the author as a psychiatric patient. In the chapter devoted to J. M. H. Berckmans (1953 - 2008) the analysis focuses on the theatricality of the mad author: the way Berckmans created an image of himself is confronted with the recent enactment of his work and persona on stage. The way in which (literary) theoretical discourses appropriate works of mad authors is studied in the chapter devoted to the French-language author Sophie Podolski (1953 - 1974). Both in a psychoanalytically orientated feminist discourse (Tel Quel, Kristeva), as in the presentation of the history of French-Belgian literature as characterized by irregularity, her texts take in a crucial position. The work of Simon Vinkenoog (1928 - 2009) reveals how the theme of madness and the way it structures the image of an author, is linked to related discourses centered around subjects such as love and drug-use in the context of the counter-culture of the 1960 s. These case-studies result in a complex and nuanced image, revealing the patterns and paradoxes that structure the way outsider literature is spoken about. It is argued that the literary discourse in the period after 1960 is characterized by the construction of the mad author as a subject that is beyond description, by an explicit reference to the problematic relation between the commentary and the commented text (outsider literature), and by the productive effect of these paradoxical characteristics on the discourse on outsider literature, resulting in the incessant possibility for literature and madness to be defined by each other. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|Fujiwara no Shunzei (1114 - December 22, 1204) was a noted Japanese {{poet and}} nobleman, son of Fujiwara no Toshitada. He was {{also known as}} Fujiwara no Toshinari or Shakua (釈阿); in his younger days (1123-67), he gave his name as Akihiro (顕広), but in 1167, changed to Shunzei. He was noted for his {{innovations}} in the waka poetic form, and for his achievement in compiling Senzai Wakashū ("Collection of a Thousand Years"), the seventh Imperial anthology of waka poetry; this work was at the behest in 1183 of the Retired Emperor Go-Shirakawa, who despite Shunzei's low rank (he was merely [...] "Chamberlain to the Empress Dowager", a nominal rank Miner describes as [...] "pitiably low" [...] ), admired him. Go-Shirakawa's trust in Shunzei is <b>significant,</b> as Imperial <b>anthologies</b> were landmarks in the poetic circles of the court, second to no other events in significance; poets were literally willing to risk their lives just {{for the chance to}} have a poem included.The Tale of the Heike relates that Shunzei was compiling the Senzai Wakashū during the Genpei War, and that Taira no Tadanori (1144-1184; he was on the opposing side, the one which did not hold the capital where Shunzei lived) ventured into enemy territory to Shunzei's residence, asking him to include a particular poem of his, and then managed to successfully escape back to his own forces without being apprehended. Shunzei eventually did decide to include Tadanori's poem, but attributed it ("tactfully" [...] as Keene characterizes it) to [...] "Anonymous." [...] His son, Fujiwara no Teika, {{is considered one of the}} four best poets in Japanese history.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{critically}} Newfoundland children's literature from 1940 to 1990 to ascertain the quantity and the quality of these books, and to provide users of the literature with a selection tool in the form of an annotated bibliography. Newfoundland children's literature was defined as being those books written by Newfoundlanders, published in Newfoundland (excluding books whose rights were purchased from the international market), or containing a <b>significant</b> Newfoundland theme. <b>Anthologies</b> and books written solely for informational purposes have been excluded. Eighty titles were located through searches of the catalogues of the Curriculum Materials Centre in the Faculty of Education at Memorial University of Newfoundland, the Newfoundland Room of the Queen Elizabeth II Library at the Memorial University of Newfoundland, and the Newfoundland Public Libraries; and examination of available publishers' catalogues, a number of standard reference and bibliographic aids, and two published annotated bibliographies of Newfoundland materials. Sixty-eight books were found for personal review and were evaluated following internationally accepted guidelines for excellence. A unified narrative discussion of books for readers under 8 years, readers aged 9 to 12 years, and readers aged 13 to 18 years was prepared. A separate descriptive and critical annotated bibliography with accompanying recommendations was provided for ready reference. Based on the examination and evaluation of the sixty-eight books, a number of conclusions were drawn regarding the quantity of books available; the quality of text, illustration, and technical production; as well as the state of Newfoundland children's books as a body of literature. A number of recommendations were made in the interest of insuring the continued development of a Newfoundland children's literature of excellence with appeal both in Newfoundland and in the wider community of readers...|$|R
