5|$|The {{interior}} decoration was extraordinarily rich. The walls were decorated with marble, {{the roof was}} gilded, while the narthex featured a depiction of the baptism of Constantine the Great. Fragments of ivory, amethyst, gold and colored glass, originally inlaid in the marble sculptures, have also been found at the site, as well as fragments of mosaics. The deliberate evocation of the Solomonic Temple was further reinforced by the preponderance of motifs such as palm trees, pomegranates and lilies in the church's decoration. A notable characteristic, {{which has not been}} attested before in Constantinopolitan art and architecture, is the extensive use of Sassanid Persian decorative motifs such as friezes of running palmette and pomegranate leaves or symmetric geometric and vegetal patterns. Persian motifs became increasingly popular in the 6th century, and were also used in the decoration of the Hagia Sophia. Another exceptional find are ten relief plaques bearing the images of Christ, the Virgin Mary and the Apostles; <b>such</b> <b>images</b> are very rare due to the destruction of human representations in the Iconoclasm of the 8th and 9th centuries.|$|E
25|$|An {{editorial}} cartoon, {{also known}} as a political cartoon, is a drawing containing a commentary expressing the artist's opinion. An artist who writes and draws <b>such</b> <b>images</b> is known as an editorial cartoonist.|$|E
25|$|Unexplained aerial {{observations}} {{have been}} reported throughout history. Some were undoubtedly astronomical in nature: comets, bright meteors, {{one or more of}} the five planets that can be seen with the naked eye, planetary conjunctions, or atmospheric optical phenomena such as parhelia and lenticular clouds. An example is Halley's Comet, which was recorded first by Chinese astronomers in 240 BC and possibly as early as 467 BC. Such sightings throughout history often were treated as supernatural portents, angels, or other religious omens. Some current-day UFO researchers have noticed similarities between some religious symbols in medieval paintings and UFO reports though the canonical and symbolic character of <b>such</b> <b>images</b> is documented by art historians placing more conventional religious interpretations on <b>such</b> <b>images.</b>|$|E

40|$|Depth at {{homogeneous}} or weakly-textured image {{areas is}} difficult to obtain because <b>such</b> <b>image</b> areas suffer the well-known correspondence problem. In this paper, we propose a voting model that predicts the depth at <b>such</b> <b>image</b> areas from the depth of bounding edge-like structures. The depth at edge-like structures is computed using a feature-based stereo algorithm, and is used {{to vote for the}} depth of homogeneous image areas. We show the results of our ongoing work on different scenarios...|$|R

25|$|Hopper's solitary {{figures are}} mostly women—dressed, semi-clad, and nude—often reading or looking out a window, {{or in the}} workplace. In the early 1920s, Hopper painted his first <b>such</b> <b>images</b> Girl at Sewing Machine (1921), New York Interior (another woman sewing) (1921), and Moonlight Interior (a nude getting into bed) (1923). Automat (1927) and Hotel Room (1931), however, are more {{representative}} of his mature style, emphasizing the solitude more overtly.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, JPEG {{may not be}} as well suited for line {{drawings}} and other textual or iconic graphics, where the sharp contrasts between adjacent pixels can cause noticeable artifacts. <b>Such</b> <b>images</b> may be better saved in a lossless graphics format such as TIFF, GIF, PNG, or a raw image format. The JPEG standard actually includes a lossless coding mode, but that mode is not supported in most products.|$|E
25|$|Rock art serves {{multiple}} {{purposes in}} the contemporary world. In several regions, it remains spiritually important to indigenous peoples, who {{view it as a}} significant component of their cultural patrimony. It also serves as an important source of cultural tourism, and hence as economic revenue in certain parts of the world. As <b>such,</b> <b>images</b> taken from cave art have appeared on memorabilia and other artefacts sold {{as a part of the}} tourist industry.|$|E

25|$|Another image {{regularly}} reported {{is that of}} Jesus Christ. Sightings of {{this type}} {{have been reported in}} such varied media as cloud photos, Marmite, chapatis, shadows, Cheetos, tortillas, trees, dental x-rays, cooking utensils, windows rocks and stones, painted and plastered walls, and dogs' hindquarters. Again, some of these items have been offered for sale on internet auction sites, and a number have been bought by the Golden Palace casino. When <b>such</b> <b>images</b> receive publicity, people frequently come considerable distances to see them, and to venerate them.|$|E
25|$|Although some images {{exist at}} the synagogue at Dura-Europos, and <b>such</b> <b>images</b> {{may have been}} common, Judaism in theory forbade images, and its {{influence}} on the depictions of Jesus remains unknown. Christian depictions of the 3rd and 4th centuries typically focused on New Testament scenes of healings and other miracles. Following the conversion of Constantine in the 4th century, Christian art found many wealthy donors and flourished. In this period Jesus began to have more mature features, and was shown with a beard. A new development at this time was the depiction of Jesus without a narrative context, but just as a figure by himself.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{has been}} {{creating}} complicated abstract paintings and litographs since the 1970s. She employs {{a wide variety}} of media, working in painting, printmaking and richly textured mixed media pieces. <b>Such</b> <b>images</b> and collage elements as commercial slogans, sign-like petroglyphs, rough drawing, and the inclusion and layering of text are unusually intersected into a complex vision created out of the artist’s personal experience. Her works contain strong, insistent socio-political commentary that speaks to past and present cultural appropriation and abuse, while identifying the continued significance of the Native American peoples. She addresses today’s tribal politics, human rights and environmental issues with humor. Smith is known internationally for her philosophically centered work regarding her strong traditional beliefs and political activism.|$|E
50|$|For real <b>images,</b> <b>such</b> as <b>images</b> {{projected}} on a screen, size means a linear dimension (measured, for example, in millimeters or inches).|$|R
25|$|A {{diverging}} lens (one that is thicker {{at the edges}} than the middle) or a convex mirror forms a virtual <b>image.</b> <b>Such</b> an <b>image</b> is so reduced in size {{when compared to the}} original object. A converging lens (one that is thicker in the middle than at the edges) or a concave mirror is also capable of producing a virtual image if the object is within the focal length. <b>Such</b> an <b>image</b> will be magnified. In contrast, an object placed in front of a converging lens or concave mirror at a position beyond the focal length produces a real <b>image.</b> <b>Such</b> an <b>image</b> may be magnified or reduced depending on the position of the object.|$|R
50|$|RawWrite and WinImage are {{examples}} of floppy disk image file writer/creator for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows. They {{can be used to}} create raw image files from a floppy disk, and write <b>such</b> <b>image</b> files to a floppy.|$|R
25|$|JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) format {{can produce}} a smaller file than PNG for {{photographic}} (and photo-like) images, since JPEG uses a lossy encoding method specifically designed for photographic image data, which is typically dominated by soft, low-contrast transitions, and an amount of noise or similar irregular structures. Using PNG instead of a high-quality JPEG for <b>such</b> <b>images</b> {{would result in a}} large increase in filesize with negligible gain in quality. In comparison, when storing images that contain text, line art, or graphics – images with sharp transitions and large areas of solid color – the PNG format can compress image data more than JPEG can. Additionally, PNG is lossless, while JPEG produces noticeable visual artifacts around high-contrast areas. Where an image contains both sharp transitions and photographic parts, a choice must be made between the two effects. JPEG does not support transparency.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of anthropomorphic images and half-human, half-animal {{images in the}} Upper Paleolithic period may further indicate that Upper Paleolithic humans were {{the first people to}} believe in a pantheon of gods or supernatural beings, though <b>such</b> <b>images</b> may instead indicate shamanistic practices similar to those of contemporary tribal societies. The earliest known undisputed burial of a shaman (and by extension the earliest undisputed evidence of shamans and shamanic practices) dates back to the early Upper Paleolithic era (BP) in what is now the Czech Republic. However, during the early Upper Paleolithic it was probably more common for all members of the band to participate equally and fully in religious ceremonies, in contrast to the religious traditions of later periods when religious authorities and part-time ritual specialists such as shamans, priests and medicine men were relatively common and integral to religious life. Additionally, {{it is also possible that}} Upper Paleolithic religions, like contemporary and historical animistic and polytheistic religions, believed in the {{existence of}} a single creator deity in addition to other supernatural beings such as animistic spirits.|$|E
25|$|In {{a totally}} {{different}} sense, polarization encoding has become the leading (but not sole) method for delivering separate images {{to the left and}} right eye in stereoscopic displays used for 3D movies. This involves separate images intended for each eye either projected from two different projectors with orthogonally oriented polarizing filters or, more typically, from a single projector with time multiplexed polarization (a fast alternating polarization device for successive frames). Polarized 3D glasses with suitable polarizing filters ensure that each eye receives only the intended image. Historically such systems used linear polarization encoding because it was inexpensive and offered good separation. However circular polarization makes separation of the two images insensitive to tilting of the head, and is widely used in 3-D movie exhibition today, such as the system from RealD. Projecting <b>such</b> <b>images</b> requires screens that maintain the polarization of the projected light when viewed in reflection (such as silver screens); a normal diffuse white projection screen causes depolarization of the projected images, making it unsuitable for this application.|$|E

30|$|Due to high {{resolution}} scanning technology {{combined with a}} high image quality, the development of non-destructive evaluation algorithms {{becomes more and more}} practical. In the following section, a model-based approach for the automatic detection and segmentation of fibers from <b>such</b> <b>image</b> data is presented.|$|R

500|$|The Raft of the Medusa fuses many {{influences}} {{from the}} Old Masters, from the Last Judgment and Sistine Chapel ceiling of Michelangelo (1475–1564) and Raphael's Transfiguration, to the monumental approach of Jacques-Louis David (1748–1825) and Antoine-Jean Gros (1771–1835), to contemporary events. [...] By the 18th century, shipwrecks {{had become a}} recognised feature of marine art, {{as well as an}} increasingly common occurrence as more journeys were made by sea. Claude Joseph Vernet (1714–1789) created many <b>such</b> <b>images,</b> achieving naturalistic colour through direct observation—unlike other artists at that time—and was said to have tied himself to the mast of a ship in order to witness a storm.|$|E
500|$|The {{practices}} of individual schools and teams {{have changed in}} response to the controversy. A local example is Washington High School in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Many Native American images have been removed, and the [...] "Warriors" [...] nickname is now claimed to be generic. The school now has a [...] "circle of courage" [...] logo with eagle feathers and has also [...] "updated" [...] the murals of Chief Hollow Horn Bear in the gym. Duane Hollow Horn Bear, the chief's great-grandson, who teaches Lakota language and history at Sinte Gleska University in Mission, stated: [...] "We had no objection to their utilizing those pictures as long as my great-grandfather was represented with honor and dignity." [...] However, not all Native Americans are happy with the presence of any <b>such</b> <b>images.</b>|$|E
500|$|Bovet watches include much artistic detail, and {{the company}} gives the {{artisans}} {{a great deal of}} independence in creating the elements of the watches, thus encouraging creativity. [...] The Chinese watches were originally sold in pairs in a mahogany box, both for good luck and so that the user would have a back-up watch if one needed repair, as repairs would sometimes take more than six months to complete. [...] The design characteristics of the watch emphasized the elements which appealed to Chinese consumers. [...] One of these appealing characteristics was the mechanics of clocks and watches, and so Bovet emphasized the beauty of the movements with its skeletonized views and highly decorative movements, the first watches to emphasize these characteristics in this way. [...] For the same reason the watches were also among the first to include a second-hand. [...] The enamel decorations were usually of European scenes or plant life, which made the watches more appealing to the Chinese consumers, since <b>such</b> <b>images</b> were as exotic to them as the European-made watches themselves.|$|E
50|$|Types include {{authorized}} <b>images,</b> <b>such</b> as film screenshots, copies from {{previously published}} <b>images,</b> <b>such</b> as shots from magazines or stills or clips from movies, to unauthorised <b>images</b> <b>such</b> as celebrity sex tapes and paparazzi photos capturing unintentional or private scenes, and faked or doctored images.|$|R
5000|$|Spatial {{depictions of}} n-dimensional code spaces as coding scheme trees on flat screens may enhance imagination, but still leave the {{dimensionality}} of image limited to intelligibility of sketching, mostly as a 3D object on a 2D screen.

500|$|The subplot of Kenny's {{diarrhea}} problems {{came from}} a real-life high school experience from Stone, who said students used to offer each other $20 if they would pass a note to the teacher explaining they had [...] "explosive diarrhea", like Kenny did in the episode. The image of Kenny sitting on a toilet in [...] "Death" [...] became a popular South Park poster. [...] "Death" [...] included a consistency error in that Mr. Garrison's classroom had its own separate bathroom, which was never again seen in future South Park episodes. During one scene, Cartman moons Kyle while making fun of Kyle's mother. Comedy Central censors forced Parker and Stone to remove the image of Cartman's bare bottom, although <b>such</b> <b>images</b> would be allowed in future episodes. A man named Mr. McCormick was killed in [...] "Death" [...] after he was flung via slingshot into the Cartoon Central building. The character's name led many to mistakenly believe it was Kenny's father, Stuart McCormick, but Parker denied this and said the similar character names were just a coincidence. The character appears again very briefly in a later episode, Starvin' Marvin.|$|E
2500|$|On Altar 8 at Tikal {{as well as}} on the Hieroglyphic Stairs at Yaxchilan, captives {{appear to}} be inside, or are at least {{superimposed}} upon, balls.

2500|$|Critic Susan Sontag argued that, through {{repeated}} exposure, certain well-known photographs {{have become}} [...] "ethical reference points", {{such as the}} many images depicting the victims and liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp (1977).
