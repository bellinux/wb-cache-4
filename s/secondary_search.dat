All articles were examined for inclusion criteria. <b>Secondary</b> <b>search</b> was conducted by hand-search through references of included articles from primary search. A total of 24 articles were obtained from both primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>search</b> and used as fundamental articles in this review. Periodontal ligament tissues of cryopreserved teeth were able to maintain their biological properties resulted in a satisfactory healing of periodontium. Dental pulp tissues, however, may be compromised by limitation of permeability of cryopreservative agent into pulp cavity. Therefore, an endodontic treatment of transplanted cryopreserved teeth was recommended. Cryopreserved teeth had comparable mechanical properties to those of normal teeth. Importantly, the success of cryopreserved tooth transplantation treatment in orthodontic patients was reported. The cryopreserved teeth for tooth banking have a potential clinical application for treatment of missing teeth. Case selection, however, is critical for treatment success.

This report documents the number and extent of Chinook salmon spawning near Ives and Pierce Islands of the Columbia River and is the sixth {{in a series of}} reports prepared since 1999. The main objectives of this study were to find deepwater spawning locations of fall Chinook salmon in the main Columbia River channel, collect additional data on physical habitat parameters at spawning sites, and provide estimates of adult spawners in the surveyed area. The primary search area was adjacent to the upper portion of Pierce Island, and the <b>secondary</b> <b>search</b> zone was downstream of this area near the lower portion of Pierce Island. A secondary objective was to document the occurrence of any chum salmon (O. keta) redds in the deeper sections downstream of Hamilton Creek (slough zone search area). Fall Chinook salmon redd numbers were down slightly from the record number found during 2003. The number of fall Chinook redds found in the Ives-Pierce Island complex (river km 228. 5) during 2004 was 293, which does not include the number of shallow water redds found by visual observation by boat by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. The redds encompassed an area of 14. 6 ha occurring adjacent to the lower part of Ives Island and Pierce Island. Peak spawning activity, based on redd counts and live fish seen near redds, was on or near November 16, 2004. An expanded redd count based on percentage video coverage in the primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>search</b> zones was 3, 198 fall Chinook salmon redds at water depths exceeding approximately 1. 0 m (approximately 125 kcfs) with an estimated spawning population of 10, 800. Fall Chinook salmon redds were found at water depths from 1. 07 to 7. 6 m and were constructed predominantly of medium cobbles ranging in size from 7. 6 to 15. 2 cm in diameter.

40|$|Objective: {{to review}} {{systematically}} {{the range of}} case definitions and methods used to measure falls in randomised controlled trials. Design/methods: a Cochrane review of fall prevention interventions was used to identify fall definitions in published trials. <b>Secondary</b> <b>searches</b> of various databases were used to identify additional methodological or theoretical papers. Two independent reviewers undertook data extraction, with adjudication by a third reviewer in cases of disagreement. Settings: community-dwelling and institutionalised older persons. Results: 90 publications met the predefined inclusion criteria. Of these, 44 provided no {{definition of the term}} fall. In the remainder, there were substantial variations in the definition and methods of measuring falls. Reporting periods ranged from 1 week to 4 years with only 41 % using prospective data collection methods. Conclusion: the standard of reporting falls in published trials is poor and significantly impedes comparison between studies.
