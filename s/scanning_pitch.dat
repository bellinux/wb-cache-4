40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest in high frequency short range guided waves to screen or monitor for corrosion. This contrasts with long range guided waves (LRGWs) which screen pipes for large patches of corrosion and have been successfully used in corrosion management for the past twenty years. The fundamental setup described in this paper uses circumferential guided waves, which are excited at a single location on a pipe and travel around the pipe wall and are detected at the same location. The study uses a finite element model assisted method to evaluate the detection capability of two short range circumferential guided wave setups which use both the reflected and transmitted signals. The setups themselves consist of either an axial array of transducers, for monitoring, or a single transducer which axially scans a pipe. Both setups have an array or <b>scan</b> <b>pitch</b> between either adjacent transducers or measurements. The detection capability of the fundamental Lamb wave modes (A 0 and S 0) in both reflection and transmission have been compared, {{as well as a}} hybrid shear horizontal wave setup, which uses the SH 0 mode in reflection and the SH 1 mode in transmission. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using two separate methods to determine the probability of detection (POD) for either the reflection or transmission signals. Both methods determine a POD for a specific defect, noise level, and array or <b>scan</b> <b>pitch.</b> Probability images are produced which map the POD for a range of defect sizes. For the parameters investigated in this study, it was found that in transmission large diameter defects have a higher detectability, whereas deep, narrow diameter defects are more detectable in reflection. A generalised overview of the sensitivity of short range guided waves is presented by combining both the reflection and transmission PODs. The data fused sensitivity of the S 0 and SH hybrid modes are given as 0. 6 % and 0. 75 % cross sectional area (CSA) respectively, allowing for the comparison with LRGWs.

40|$|The spatial {{resolved}} energy spectra can {{be observed}} during a long discharge of NBI plasma by continuously scanning the neutral particle analyzer. In these discharges, the plasmas are initiated by the ECH heating, after that NBI# 2 (Co-injection) sustains the plasma during 40 - 60 seconds. The <b>scanned</b> <b>pitch</b> angle is from 44 degrees to 74 degrees. The injected neutral beam (hydrogen) energy of NBI# 2 is only 130 keV because the original ion source polarity is negative.

It reflects the injection pitch angle of the beam according to the simulation (53 degrees ot R * = 3. 75 m in simulation). The beam keeps the pitch angle at incidence until the beam energy becomes to the energy, which the pitch angle scattering is occurred by the energy loss due to the electron collision.

40|$|Components made in {{composite}} material can lower {{the weight of}} structures significantly. The higher production and material cost, however, require the application of novel design strategies which allow for the cost-efficient production of these components. A methodology for a combined cost/weight optimization of composite components is presented herein. The objective function is formed by a simplified form of direct operating cost, i. e. by a weighted sum of the manufacturing cost and the component weight. The parameter that governs the balance between manufacturing cost and weight is called weight penalty and incorporates the effect of fuel burn, environmental impact or contractual penalties due to overweight. In addition, a non-destructive testing model is implemented that calculates design allowables of a laminate based on ultrasonic scan parameters. In a case study, {{the effect of the}} laminate quality on the direct operating cost is discussed. It is investigated how the permissible flaw size and therefore the <b>scan</b> <b>pitch</b> of a composite laminate can influence the optimal solution in terms of cost and weight; thus, the manufacturing cost, the non-destructive testing cost and the weight of a component can be balanced by optimizing the laminate quality in an early design phase. The optimization framework also contains a draping simulation in combination with a detailed cost estimation package and the calculation of the structural performance based on FE. First, a draping knowledge database is generated in which combinations of seed points and reference angles are evaluated in terms of fibre angle deviation, scrap, ultrasonic cuts and material shear. Second, the cost/weight optimization framework picks the best sets of plies during the subsequent optimization. By means of parametric studies it is shown that the design solution strongly depends on the magnitude of the weight penalty. It is also shown that the non-destructive testing affects the cost and choice of design concept and the permissible flaw size should be altered in order to save both weight and cost. Finally, the methodology is tested by means of a curved C-spar which is designed using plain weave and unidirectional prepreg. Different objectives in the generation of the draping database lead to different design solutions. QC 20110128 NFFP PriceXPRE...|$|R

Hence, a comparative value is required which {{is used for the}} evaluation of a design solution in terms of cost and weight. The direct operating cost (DOC) can be used as this comparative value; it captures all costs that arise when the aircraft is flown. In this work, a cost/weight optimization framework for composite structures is proposed. It takes into account manufacturing cost, non-destructive testing cost and the lifetime fuel consumption based on the weight of the aircraft, thus using a simplified version of the DOC as the objective function. First, the different phases in the design of an aircraft are explained. It is then focused on the advantages and drawbacks of composite structures, the design constraints and allowables, and non-destructive inspection. Further, the topics of multiobjective optimization and the combined optimization of cost and weight are addressed. Manufacturing cost can be estimated by means of different techniques; here, feature-based cost estimations and parametric cost estimations proved to be most suitable for the proposed framework. Finally, a short summary of the appended papers is given. The first paper contains a parametric study in which a skin/stringer panel is optimized for a series of cost/weight ratios (weight penalties) and material configurations. The weight penalty, defined as the specific lifetime fuel burn, is dependent on the fuel consumption of the aircraft, the fuel price and the viewpoint of the optimizer. It is concluded that the ideal choice of the design solution is neither low-cost nor low-weight but rather a combination thereof. The second paper proposes the inclusion of non-destructive testing cost in the design process of the component, and the adjustment of the design strength of each laminate according to the inspection parameters. Hence, the <b>scan</b> <b>pitch</b> of the ultrasonic testing is regarded as a variable, representing an index for the (guaranteed) laminate quality. It is shown that the direct operating cost can be lowered when the quality level of the laminate is assigned and adjusted in an early design stage. QC 2010111...|$|R

40|$|Music {{performance}} requires {{control of}} two sequential structures: the ordering of pitches and the temporal intervals between successive pitches. Whether pitch and temporal structures are processed as separate or integrated features remains unclear. A repetition suppression paradigm compared neural and behavioral correlates of mapping pitch sequences and temporal sequences to motor movements in music performance. Fourteen pianists listened to and performed novel melodies on an MR-compatible piano keyboard during fMRI <b>scanning.</b> The <b>pitch</b> or temporal {{patterns in the}} melodies either changed or repeated (remained the same) across consecutive trials. We expected decreased neural response to the patterns (pitch or temporal) that repeated across trials relative to patterns that changed. Pitch and temporal accuracy were high, and pitch accuracy improved when either pitch or temporal sequences repeated over trials. Repetition of either pitch or temporal sequences was associated with linear BOLD decrease in frontal–parietal brain regions including dorsal and ventral premotor cortex, pre-SMA, and superior parietal cortex. Pitch sequence repetition (in contrast to temporal sequence repetition) was associated with linear BOLD decrease in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) while pianists listened to melodies {{they were about to}} perform. Decreased BOLD response in IPS also predicted increase in pitch accuracy only when pitch sequences repeated. Thus, behavioral performance and neural response in sensorimotor mapping networks were sensitive to both pitch and temporal structure, suggesting that pitch and temporal structure are largely integrated in auditory– motor transformations. IPS may be involved in transforming pitch sequences into spatial coordinates for accurate piano performance. ...|$|R
40|$|Composite {{structures}} {{can lower}} {{the weight of}} an airliner significantly. Due to the higher process complexity and the high material cost, however, the low weight often comes with {{a significant increase in}} production cost. The application of cost-effective design strategies is one mean to meet this challenge. In this thesis, a simplified form of direct operating cost is suggested as a comparative value that in combination with multidisciplinary optimization enables the evaluation of a design solution in terms of cost and weight. The proposed cost optimization framework takes into account the manufacturing cost, the non-destructive testing cost and the lifetime fuel consumption based on the weight of the aircraft, thus using a simplified version of the direct operating cost as the objective function. The manufacturing cost can be estimated by means of different techniques. For the proposed optimization framework, feature-based parametric cost models prove to be most suitable. Paper A contains a parametric study in which a skin/stringer panel is optimized for a series of cost/weight ratios (weight penalties) and material configurations. The weight penalty (defined as the specific lifetime fuel burn) is dependent on the fuel consumption of the aircraft, the fuel price and the viewpoint of the optimizer. It is concluded that the ideal choice of the design solution is neither low-cost nor low-weight but rather a combination thereof. Paper B proposes the inclusion of non-destructive testing cost in the design process of composite components, and the adjustment of the design strength of each laminate according to inspection parameters. Hence, the <b>scan</b> <b>pitch</b> of the ultrasonic testing is regarded as a variable, representing an index for the guaranteed material quality. It is shown that the cost for non-destructive testing can be lowered if the quality level of the laminate is assigned and adjusted in an early design stage. In Paper C and Paper D the parameters of the manufacturing processes are upgraded during the cost optimization of the component. In Paper C, the framework is extended by the cost-efficient adaptation of parameters in order to reflect the situation when machining an aluminum component. For different weight penalties, the spar thickness and stringer geometry of the provided case study vary. In addition, another cutter is chosen with regard to the modified shape of the stringer. In Paper D, the methodology is extended to the draping of composite fabrics, thus optimizing not only the stacking layup, but also the draping strategy itself. As in the previous cases, the design alters for different settings of the weight penalty. In particular, one can see a distinct change in fiber layup between the minimum weight and the minimum cost solution. Paper E summarizes the work proposed in Papers A-D and provides a case study on a C-spar component. Five material systems are used for this case study and compared in terms of cost and weight. The case study shows the impact of the weight penalty, the material cost and the labor rate on the choice of the material system. For low weight penalties, for example, the aluminum spar is the most cost-effective solution. For high weight penalties, the RTM system is favorable. The paper also discusses shortcomings with the presented methodology and thereby opens up for future method developments.

The first observation is an easy one (top left in the image captioned [...] "Reversed head in various…"). If the stick head is rotated onto the reverse (lighter colour) the toe is not going to disappear into the ground to enable the reverse side of the stick to be presented to the ball—a vertical adjustment is necessary. Secondly (top right), if the handle of the stick is kept at exactly the same angle and rotated, a horizontal adjustment is necessary to bring the reversed head to a position where contact will be made with the ball. The third figure (bottom left) shows these adjustments having been made (and a change to the angle of the handle because the position of the hand holding the stick at the top would be about the same as it is when gripping the stick in the forehand position), but the area of stick head making contact with the ball is very small; so control may not be adequate. The fourth figure (bottom right) demonstrates that to get good contact with the ball on a larger area of the reversed head, it is necessary to move the handle much nearer to the vertical. This means the player must bring the ball in very close to the feet and come to a more upright dribbling position—this in turn impairs the ability to <b>scan</b> the <b>pitch</b> and keep the ball in peripheral vision at the same time—a considerable disadvantage when dribbling to evade opponents.|$|R

Since the LRF has the ability to directly measure 3 D coordinates and the stability against the ambient light influence, meanwhile, the camera has the ability to acquire color information, the combination of the two sensors by making use of their advantages is utilized to obtain more accurate measurements as well as to simplify information processing. To overlay the camera image with the measurement points of the LRF <b>pitching</b> <b>scan</b> and to reconstruct the 3 D image which includes the depth-of-field information, the model and the calibration of the system are built. Based on the combination of the color features extracted from the color image and the shape, size features extracted from the 3 D depth-of-field image, the target object identification and localization are implemented autonomously. In order to extract the shape and size features, a triangular facet normal vector clustering (TFNVC) algorithm is introduced. The effectiveness of the proposed method and algorithm are validated by some experimental testing and analysis carried out on the mobile manipulator platform. © 2011 IEEE.

40|$|Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) play a {{vital role}} for verifying patient {{position}} for many radiotherapy treatments. As DRRs are generated from CT scans, image quality may be affected by the scanning mode (axial or helical). The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the high and low contrast resolution and the spatial linearity in DRRs as a function of CT scanning mode and to highlight the significance of this variation, if any. A commercial CT phantom (Fluke Biomedical Model 76 - 417) was scanned with a Siemens Somatom Sensation 4 CT scanner using six variations of field of view, scanning mode and helical pitch. The image quality of the DRR 2 ̆ 7 s produced from the scans was evaluated in terms of high contrast resolution using the modulation transfer function, low contrast resolution using Image Quality Score method and spatial linearity. The results indicated that the high contrast resolution for the axial mode was comparable to that for the helical modes. The low contrast resolution with axial scanning was comparable to scans performed with a helical pitch of 1 but deteriorated at pitches greater than 1. The field of view was not found to impact the low contrast resolution. When changing scanning parameters the impact on DRR quality should be considered. For DRRs, particularly where visualisation of low contrast structures is desired, a helical <b>scan</b> with a <b>pitch</b> of 1 is recommended...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionRecent {{advances}} in coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) {{allow for the}} performance of CCTA with very low radiation doses. The aim of this analysis is to determine the impact of adopting new dose reducing techniques on overall radiation exposure in consecutive patients without known CAD undergoing CCTA to rule out coronary disease. MethodsWe included 839 consecutive patients without known CAD who underwent CCTA to rule out coronary disease between January 2007 and June 2012. New dose reducing techniques were adopted in June 2010. These included High <b>Pitch</b> Dual Source <b>Scanning</b> (FLASH) and Iterative Reconstruction (IR). The total radiation dose was calculated for each scan from the Dose Length Product multiplied by conversion factor (0. 014). The annual median radiation doses were compared over the study period. ResultsAfter the adoption of the new scanning techniques (n= 578), 56 % of the scans were done with High <b>Pitch</b> <b>Scanning,</b> 41 % with Prospective Gating (36 % of which were done with IR) and 3 % with retrospective gating and dose modulation. This was associated with more than 80 % reduction in the radiation doses with a median radiation dose of 2. 7, 1. 5 and 1. 8 mSiV in 2010, 2011 and 2012 (first 6 months) respectively. There was no difference in the frequency of non-diagnostic studies or imaging quality before and after 2010. A total of 11 % and 63 % of the scans had a radiation dose less than 1 and 2 mSv respectively. ConclusionsOur analysis demonstrates that in the current era, low radiation CCTA can be routinely done in daily clinical practice...|$|R
30|$|RDCT {{followed}} by LDCT and ULDCT were acquired with a 64 -row multidetector CT (Discovery CT 750 HD; GE Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA). All {{patients in the}} study were able to undergo abdominopelvic CT in the supine position with both arms elevated and with a single breath-hold for each acquisition. In this prospective clinical study, RDCT, LDCT, and ULDCT were acquired with minimal differences in data acquisition conditions (with the exception of radiation dose). For instance, to minimize the positional difference between the three acquisitions for each patient, the time between each scan was kept to a minimum (about 10  s or less). To avoid contrast enhancement bias owing to the delay in imaging {{from the start of the}} injection, only unenhanced CT images were included in this study. Scanning parameters other than tube current were held constant. The remaining scanning parameters were as follows: tube voltage of 120 kilovolt peak, helical <b>scan</b> acquisition mode, <b>pitch</b> of 1.375 : 1, gantry rotation time of 0.4  s, field of view of 360  mm (adjusted to patient size), and detector configuration of 64 × 0.625  mm. All images were reconstructed with 0.625  mm thick axial slices, and images with increased slice thickness of 2.5  mm (by averaging) were also used for interpretation as necessary. Images with coronal/sagittal reformats were not used for evaluation in this study, since the preliminary results of phantom experiments indicated that MBIR and ASIR behave differently in terms of image noise when reformatted into coronal and sagittal slices (unpublished data). The STANDARD kernel (a proprietary kernel of GE Healthcare) was used for image reconstruction for FBP and ASIR (there is no concept of kernel for MBIR).|$|R
40|$|Longitudinal partial volume effects (z-axial PVE), which {{occur when}} an object partly {{occupies}} a slice, degrade image resolution and contrast in computed tomography (CT). Z-axial PVE is unavoidable for subslice objects and reduces their contrast {{according to their}} fraction contained within the slice. This effect can be countered using a smaller slice thickness, but {{at the cost of}} an increased image noise or radiation dose. The aim {{of this study is to}} offer a tool for optimizing the reconstruction parameters (slice thickness and slice spacing) in CT protocols in the case of partial volume effects. This optimization is based on the tradeoff between axial resolution and noise. For that purpose, we developed a simplified analytical model investigating the average statistical effect of z-axial PVE on contrast and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). A Catphan 500 phantom was <b>scanned</b> with various <b>pitches</b> and CTDI and reconstructed with different slice thicknesses to assess the visibility of subslice targets that simulate low contrast anatomical features present in CT exams. The detectability score of human observers was used to rank the perceptual image quality against the CNR. Contrast and CNR reduction due to z-axial PVE measured on experimental data were first compared to numerical calculations and then to the analytical model. Compared to numerical calculations, the simplified algebraic model slightly overestimated the contrast but the differences remained below 5 %. It could determine the optimal reconstruction parameters that maximize the objects visibility for a given dose in the case of z-axial PVE. An optimal slice thickness equal to three-fourth of the object width was correctly proposed by the model for nonoverlapping slices. The tradeoff between detectability and dose is maximized for a slice spacing of half the slice thickness associated with a slice width equal to the characteristic object width...|$|R
40|$|Alloys {{based on}} the titanium-niobium system are widely used in implant production. It is conditional, first of all, on the low modulus of {{elasticity}} and bio-inert properties of an alloy. These alloys are especially important for tooth replacement and orthopedic surgery. At present alloys {{based on the}} titanium-niobium system are produced mainly using conventional metallurgical methods. The further subtractive manufacturing an end product results {{in a lot of}} wastes, increasing, therefore, its cost. The alternative of these processes is additive manufacturing. Selective laser melting is a technology, which makes it possible to synthesize products of metal powders and their blends. The point of this technology is laser melting a layer of a powdered material; then a sintered layer is coated with the next layer of powder etc. Complex products and working prototypes are made on the base of this technology. The authors of this paper address to the issue of applying selective laser melting in order to synthesize a binary alloy of a composite powder based on the titanium-niobium system. A set of 10 x 10 mm samples is made in various process conditions. The samples are made by an experimental selective laser synthesis machine "VARISKAF- 100 MB". The machine provides adjustment of the following process variables: laser emission power, <b>scanning</b> rate and <b>pitch,</b> temperature of powder pre-heating, thickness of the layer to be sprinkled, and diameter of laser spot focusing. All samples are made in the preliminary vacuumized shielding atmosphere of argon. The porosity and thickness of the sintered layer related to the laser emission power are shown at various scanning rates. It is revealed that scanning rate and laser emission power are adjustable process variables, having the greatest effect on forming the sintered layer...|$|R
40|$|Two {{ultrasonic}} {{techniques are}} well established for pipe inspection and monitoring: highly sensitive ultrasonic spot thickness measurements, {{which can be}} presented in C-scan form, or low frequency guided waves that rapidly screen large areas for big defects. Recently {{there has been a}} growing interest in pipe inspection and monitoring systems exploring the middle ground between these two techniques by using higher frequency guided waves over shorter distances. In this paper the use of an axial transducer array (more suitable for monitoring applications) or a single axially scanned transducer (more suitable for inspections) that sends and receives dispersive circumferential guided waves around a pipe has been studied. The presence of a defect is detected {{as a result of a}} change in the wave travel time around the pipe circumference as a result of the thickness reduction. Both measurement modalities have a pitch between adjacent transducers/measurements. By approximating the pipe to a plate, a finite element model assisted method to evaluate the detection capabilities (probability of detection-POD) of this short range guided wave technique as a function of <b>scan</b> or transducer <b>pitch</b> is presented. The performance of three guided wave modes (A 0, S 0, and SH 1) are compared in a 10 mm thick plate. The results help to optimize the pitch and defect sensitivity of the setup. For the parameters investigated in this study, it was found that the S 0 mode, at 2 MHz. mm, is the most suitable for detecting wide shallow defects. For the same detection capabilities a much wider pitch can be used for S 0 mode transducers as compared to SH 1 mode transducers. Whereas the SH 1 mode, at 3 MHz. mm, is better suited to detecting narrow and deep defects using a relatively small pitch. The S 0 mode is much less sensitive to these defects. The A 0 mode was excluded from the POD analysis because it had a much higher variability in average thickness measurements, at comparable SNRs, compared to the other two modes...|$|R
