5000|$|A {{compensation}} winding in a DC <b>shunt</b> <b>motor</b> is a winding {{in the field}} pole face plate that carries armature current to reduce stator field distortion. Its purpose is to reduce brush arcing and erosion in DC motors that are operated with weak fields, variable heavy loads or reversing operation such as steel-mill motors. When flux from the armature current is about equal to the flux from the field current, the flux at the field pole plate is shifted. Under a fixed load, there is an optimal commutation point for the brushes that minimizes arcing and erosion of the brushes. When the ratio of armature flux to field flux varies greatly or reverses, the optimum commutation point shifts as result of the varying flux at the pole face plate. The result is arcing of the brushes. By adding a compensating winding in the pole face plate that carries armature current {{in the opposite direction}} of current in the adjacent armature windings, the position of the flux at the pole face plate can be restored to the position it would have with zero armature current. The main drawback of a {{compensation winding}} is the expense.|$|E

The field being wound with a large number of turns of small wire, while the Armature is wound with either Drum or Gramme Ring. The effect of current in the field and Armature causes a skewing of the lines of flux, causing what is known as "cross turns" and "back turns" in the Armature. The cross turns on the Armature tend to change distribution of lines of force on the role faces, skewing them over from trailing tip to entering tip {{in the case of a}} motor. To avoid piling up of these lines of force it is necessary to increase the magnetic resistance of the air gap or equivalent at the sides of the pole pieces, or by increasing the air space under the corners...|$|R

40|$|Direct current (dc) motors {{are used}} in {{terrestrial}} photovoltaic (PV) systems such as in water-pumping systems for irrigation and water supply. Direct current motors may {{also be used for}} space applications. Simple and low weight systems including dc motors may be of special interest in space where the motors are directly coupled to the solar cell array (with no storage). The system will operate only during times when sufficient insolation is available. An important performance characteristic of electric motors is the starting to rated torque ratio. Different types of dc motors have different starting torque ratios. These ratios are dictated by the size of solar cell array, and the developed motor torque may not be sufficient to overcome the load starting torque. By including a maximum power point tracker (MPPT) in the PV system, the starting to rated torque ratio will increase, the amount of which depends on the motor type. The starting torque ratio is calculated for the permanent magnet, series and <b>shunt</b> excited dc <b>motors</b> when powered by solar cell arrays for two cases: with and without MPPT's.
