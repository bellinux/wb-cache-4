Nowadays automobile companies {{are working on}} <b>self</b> <b>drive</b> <b>car</b> but the Indian roads not competable to driven self driving car on the roads therefore new Aerodrive Celerio self driving car is the best solution to overcome this problem. Maruti Celerio self driving car is totally made up wires and automatic features. It is a crude feature. In India it is developed by small startup called fisheyebox is the first. The basic concept of car is self drive and work by computer system/ features, {{with the help of}} camera, sensor, radar,electricity. This <b>self</b> <b>drive</b> <b>car</b> is have a very important feature. It is work on renewable source, it is not harmfull / distory nature. In this paper the author(s) firstly, introduce about the new Indian Aerodrive Celerio self driving car. Secondly, we will discuss about what kind of technologies used in this car. In this paper we will also discuss about Indian roads and comparison between google drive car and new Indian Aerodrive Celerio self driving car. In this paper we will also discussed about communication technologies like V 2 V and V 2 I and for the better communication how 5 G will support for the self driving cars...|$|E

It is also equipped with telescoping laser scanner {{on the roof}} called TrackView which can be raised by 70 centimeters and delivers a precise 3D perspective by combining data from all the various sensors to map the surrounding terrain.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the course}} of six years, I brought {{ambulatory}} psychophysiology {{into a variety of}} industries as a means of conducting design research. I looked at the stress of children in occupational therapy, the frustration of playing Hasbro board games, the thrill of driving a Google <b>Self</b> <b>Driving</b> <b>Car,</b> the confidence of shopping at Best Buy and Lowes, the excitement of playing LEGO Technic for the first time, the tension of watching one's first symphony, and the anxiety of talking about birth control. Working with stake holders within these settings I developed "Thick Psychophysiology," defined by four characteristics: 1. Psychophysiological data is quantitatively measured, 2. The research answers explorative, open ended questions, 3. The research measures external context, and 4. The research measures internal context. By combining ethnographic methods with psychophysiology, researchers can address the challenges of specificity that ambulatory, explorative research produces. Two case studies of preliminary design research are provided about the LEGO Group and the New World Symphony, showcasing how thick psychophysiology can help uncover customer's unarticulated needs. Once needs are uncovered, the challenge is how to motivate an organization to address those needs. Traditionally, designers use storytelling as a way to communicate research findings in regards to user experience, which in some cases can be ineffective in creating the needed motivation. The method developed in this thesis contains components designed to help influence organizational change. To test the effect psychophysiological data can have on organizational change, I delivered a survey testing four ways (conditions) of presenting findings: Storytelling (the most common method used by companies such as IDEO), Video-based (adding video to the story), and two conditions using Video and psychophysiology, varying how the physiological insights were presented (narrow vs. broad). Participants in the broad condition were told the skin conductance could mean a variety of things including moving, breathing hard, being stressed, or being excited. We analyzed the results of 143 LEGO employees. Participants in the broad skin conductance condition had a 47 % chance of increasing the priority of the proposed initiative, whereas only 9 % of participants in the storytelling condition increased the priority of that initiative (p< 0. 0 1). Post hoc analysis showed that when participants reported an empathic response to the skin conductance, they were even more likely to increase the priority of that broad skin conductance initiative (75 %). These results suggest that, when compared to storytelling, presenting psychophysiological data can be a more effective way to communicate customer experience. by Elliott Bruce Hedman. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|This Diploma thesis {{deals with}} {{utilization}} of electric <b>driven</b> <b>cars</b> in Czech Republic. There are two cardinal {{aspects of this}} research. Firstly I {{would like to give}} an answer if expansion of electric <b>driven</b> <b>cars</b> could help Czech Republic with greenhouse gas emission reduction. This goal will be achieved by quantitative analysis when four different scenarios of electric <b>driven</b> <b>cars</b> expansion will be calculated. Result of this analysis will be affected by several significant aspects. The most important aspect is structure of Czech energy mix which influences environmental friendliness of using electric <b>driven</b> <b>car.</b> Outcome of this analysis will tell us if we should support electric <b>driven</b> <b>cars</b> expansion in Czech Republic. Finally Diploma thesis proves {{that it is possible to}} use electric driven vehicles as a tool for greenhouse gas emission reduction in Czech conditions. Second important aspect related with electromobility is the financial competitiveness to combustion engine <b>driven</b> <b>car.</b> In this case the goal of analysis will be set as comparative analysis of lifecycle costs. Social external costs (as greenhouse gas emissions) will be included to the analysis as well. Result of this analysis tells us what type of power <b>drive</b> in passenger <b>car</b> is financially preferable...|$|R

However, unlike the differentials on the drive axles which are configured to provide torque equally to both wheels, the centre differential is usually set to have a bias to one set of drive wheels or the other, depending on application of the car.|$|R
