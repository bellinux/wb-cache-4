40|$|Purpose: To {{report the}} outcome of <b>self-retained</b> amniotic {{membrane}} after debridement in recurrent dendritic keratitis. Observations: A 70 -year-old female with a recurrent dendritic corneal ulcer received debridement followed by placement of <b>self-retained</b> amniotic membrane. Five days after treatment, the patient experienced a complete resolution of symptoms, marked reduction of inflammation, complete re-epithelialization of the cornea and improvement of visual acuity. The corneal surface remained stable for 18 months despite noncompliance in using antiviral therapy. Conclusions and importance: <b>Self-retained</b> amniotic membrane after debridement appears effective in treating dendritic keratitis. While early debridement is crucial to remove the infected corneal epithelium, amniotic membrane was shown to enhance the healing without scarring or recurrence. Besides the known anti-inflammatory and anti-scarring effects of the amniotic membrane, it may have a potential topical antiviral effect that warrants further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} <b>self-retained</b> cryopreserved amniotic membrane (CAM) in promoting corneal nerve regeneration and improving corneal sensitivity in dry eye disease (DED). Methods. In this prospective randomized clinical trial, subjects with DED were randomized to receive CAM (study group) or conventional maximum treatment (control). Changes in signs and symptoms, corneal sensitivity, topography, and in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) were evaluated at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months. Results. Twenty subjects (age 66. 9 [*]±[*] 8. 9) were enrolled and 17 completed all follow-up visits. Signs and symptoms were significantly improved in the study group yet remained constant in the control. IVCM showed {{a significant increase in}} corneal nerve density in the study group (12, 241 [*]±[*] 5083 [*]μm/mm 2 at baseline, 16, 364 [*]±[*] 3734 [*]μm/mm 2 at 1 month, and 18, 827 [*]±[*] 5453 [*]μm/mm 2 at 3 months, p= 0. 015) but was unchanged in the control. This improvement was accompanied with a significant increase in corneal sensitivity (3. 25 [*]±[*] 0. 6 [*]cm at baseline, 5. 2 [*]±[*] 0. 5 [*]cm at 1 month, and 5. 6 [*]±[*] 0. 4 [*]cm at 3 months, p< 0. 001) and corneal topography only in the study group.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tobacco {{smoking is}} {{a major cause of}} {{preventable}} disease and premature death. Physicians should play {{an active role in the}} control of smoking by encouraging cessation and helping the smoker to choose the most suitable aid to cessation. AIM: To evaluate a simple, ear acupuncture treatment for the cessation of smoking. METHOD: Randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 78 currently smoking volunteers from the general public. Volunteers attended an acupuncture clinic in a general practice setting and were given a single treatment of electroacupuncture using two needles at either an active or a placebo site plus <b>self-retained</b> ear seeds for two weeks. The major outcome measure was biochemically validated total cessation of smoking at six months. RESULTS: A total of 12. 5 % of the active treatment group compared with 0 % of the placebo group ceased smoking at six months (P = 0. 055, 95 % confidence interval - 0. 033 to 0. 323).

50|$|Foley first {{described}} {{the use of}} a <b>self-retaining</b> balloon catheter in 1929, to be used to achieve haemostasis after cystoscopic prostatectomy. He worked on development of this design for use as an indwelling urinary catheter, to provide continuous drainage of the bladder, in the 1930s. His design incorporated an inflatable balloon towards the tip of the tube which could be inflated inside the bladder to retain the catheter without external taping or strapping. He demonstrated this to the American Urologists Society in 1935, and published a paper describing it in 1937.While he was still developing his catheter, a patent was issued to Paul Raiche of the Davol Rubber Company of Providence, Rhode Island in 1936. Four months later, in October 1936, Foley applied for the patent, and was awarded this after appearing before the patent office Board of Appeals. Raiche appealed this decision in court, and it was overturned, returning the patent to Raiche. A further request for a hearing made by Foley was refused, and so the patent stayed with Raiche.|$|E

This study evaluates {{the effect of}} cryopreserved human amniotic membrane (hAM) on one-year survival of penetrating keratoplasties (PKP) in high-risk recipients. MethodThis is a retrospective noncomparative cohort study of 58 consecutive eyes undergoing PKP with concurrent placement of a <b>self-retained</b> cryopreserved hAM (PROKERA®) at a tertiary care center from January 2009 to July 2010. ResultsMean patient age was 66. 7 ± 17. 2 years and 30 (54 %) were males. 51 eyes were pseudophakic and one aphakic. 27 eyes were glaucomatous; 24 had glaucoma drainage device and 2 had previous endocyclophotocoagulation. 12 patients had PKP {{for the first time}} and 46 had repeat PKP (average number of prior PKP= 1. 63 ± 1. 1, range: 1 – 5). Risk factors for graft failure included repeat PKP (79. 3 %), corneal neovascularization (51. 7 %), preexisting glaucoma (46. 6 %), and presence of anterior synechiae (37. 9 %). Both First Transplant and Repeat Transplant groups had similar survival rates until 6 months after transplant (75 % vs 74 %, odds ratio= 1. 06, p= 1. 00). At 12 months, First Transplant group showed a better survival rate (67 % vs 43 %, odds ratio= 2. 60, p= 0. 20). Eyes with > 3 risk factors had a higher graft failure rate (odds ratio= 5. 81, p= 0. 003). ConclusionSurvey of the literature suggests that high-risk PKP with concurrent hAM placement demonstrate comparable graft survival. Presence of multiple risk factors is associated with poor survival...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{developed}} a prosthesis for open pleurostomy cases where pulmonary decortication is not indicated, or where post-pneumonectomy space infection occurs. The open pleural window procedure not only creates a large {{hole in the}} chest wall that is shocking to patients, also results in a permanent deformation of the thorax. prosthesis for open pleurostomy is a <b>self-retained</b> silicone tube that requires the removal of 3 cm of one rib for insertion, and acts as a mature conventional open pleural window. Herein, we report our 13 -year experience with this device {{in the management of}} different kinds of pleural empyema. METHODS: Forty-four consecutive patients with chronic empyema were treated. The etiology of empyema was diverse: pneumonia, 20; lung resections, 12 (pneumonectomies, 7; lobectomies, 4; non-anatomical, 1); mixed-tuberculous, 6; and mixed-malignant pleural effusion, 6. After debridment of both pleural surfaces, the prosthesis for open pleurostomy was inserted and attached to a small recipient plastic bag. RESULTS: Infection control was achieved in 20 / 20 (100 %) of the parapneumonic empyemas, in 3 / 4 (75 %) of post-lobectomies, in 6 / 7 (85 %) of post-pneumectomies, in 6 / 6 (100 %) of mixed-tuberculous cases, and in 4 / 6 (83 %) of mixed-malignant cases. Lung re-expansion was also successful in 93 %, 75 %, 33 %, and 40 % of the groups, respectively CONCLUSIONS: Prosthesis for open pleurostomy insertion is a minimally invasive procedure that can be as effective as conventional open pleural window for management of chronic empyemas. Thus, we propose that the use of prosthesis for open pleurostomy should replace the conventional method...|$|R
50|$|Cusco's self {{retaining}} bivalved speculum is {{a surgical}} instrument used for vaginal and cervical examination. It has a jaw which opens {{up like a}} duck bill. It comes in three models : side scew, centre screw and in special narrow virgin size. The Cusco's speculum is usually 80mm long and 22 mm broad. However, smaller and larger sizes are available. Cusco's speculum is used for introducing an intrauterine contraceptive device, taking a Pap smear, cauterization of vaginal erosion and for colposcopic examination. It is preferred in cryosurgery because it protects the anterior and posterior vaginal wall. The advantage of Cusco's speculum {{is that it is}} <b>self-retaining.</b> Therefore, an assistant's help is not needed to keep the speculum in place. It also acts as the vaginal wall retractor. However, it reduces the space in the vaginal cavity and therefore is not a preferred instrument for vaginal surgery. Since it covers most of the vaginal wall, small lesions on the vaginal wall may be masked by the blades of the device.|$|E

40|$|Source of support: Self {{financing}} Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to design a <b>self-retaining</b> rat contact lens to simplify intravitreous injection in rats. Material/Methods: A <b>self-retaining,</b> plane-concave prism contact lens customized for rats was designed. Forty diabetic rats were randomly divided into 2 groups and received the intravitreous injection of 10 μl of a cell suspension contain-ing bone marrow-derived stroma cell (BMSC). Group A: used a microsyringe and a rat contact lens (n= 20). Group B: used the same microsyringe and a traditional cover-slip (n= 20). The duration of the intravitreous in-jection course and the success rate of intravitreous injection were observed. Results: With the use of a <b>self-retaining</b> rat contact lens, a clear and stable view of the rat fundus was provided and the intravitreous injection course of rats quickly achieved, averaging 4. 65 ± 0. 53 min in Group A and 12. 33 ± 2. 79 min in Group B. The difference was statistically significant, and the time saved averaged 7. 68 min. None of the Group A rats had retinal bleeding or lens injury; whereas 2 of 20 Group B rats had bleeding and 1 of 20 had lens injury. There was no significant difference between the rats in Group A and Group B.

40|$|Femoral {{neuropathy}} {{can result}} from diverse etiologies following abdominal surgery. We describe four cases of postoperative femoral neuropathy after proctological procedures that were carried out at our hospital. The related symptoms developed occultly but eventually impaired patient motor or sensory functions in the lower extremities. When the patient fails to address associated suffering, {{it is easy for}} clinicians to neglect this type of morbidity. All patients recovered from neuropathy following timely detection of the disease entity con-firmed by electromyography and nerve conduction studies, followed by adequate rehabilita-tion management.

30|$|In 1967, McKenzie {{described}} the first {{account for the}} use of an internal multiple barbed suture to repair flexor tendons in a canine model [1, 2]. Recently, with the improvement in biomaterial and US Food and Drug Administration approval of barbed nylon, polydioxanone and polypropylene sutures, a renascent interest in this kind of suture material was registered. Quill™ <b>Self-Retaining</b> System (SRS) (Angiotech, Vancouver, BC, Canada) is a barbed bidirectional suture, created using absorbable and non-absorbable materials, with barbs spiraling around the central core suture and armed with a surgical needle on each end.

30|$|In January 2007, a {{new concept}} in wound closure was {{introduced}} in the USA, the bidirectional barbed suture (Quill® <b>Self-Retaining</b> System, SRS: Angiotech Pharmaceuticals). Even though the materials are similar to the conventional suture (nylon, polypropylene and PDS), it has a revolutionary design. The Quill® SRS consists of a monofilament with tiny barbs cut into the length of the surface, self-anchoring to the tissue. This self-anchoring capacity eliminates the need for surgical knots and hysterorrhaphy becomes easier, therefore reducing surgical time and blood loss. Although Quill® SRS is more expensive, less suture is required for hysterorrhaphy compared with conventional suture, resulting in a better cost-effective alternative.|$|E

Methods: In this prospective, randomized clinical trial, 38 patients with canalicular or punctal obstruction (25 partial, 13 complete) and epiphora were randomized into two groups. Twenty-one patients (14 with partial and seven with complete obstruction) underwent SRS intubation and 17 patients underwent bicanalicular silicon intubation in a randomized fashion. Results: After a mean follow-up of 6 months following tube removal, 16 (76 %, 12 partial, four complete) of the 21 eyes in the SRS intubation group and 13 (76 %, 10 partial, three complete) in the bicanalicular silicon intubation group had a successful outcome and remained symptom-free. For partial obstructions, the success rate was 85 % and 90 % for the SRS and bicanalicular silicon intubation groups, respectively. The corresponding values for complete obstruction were 63 % and 50 % for the SRS and bicanalicular silicon intubation groups, respectively. Conclusion: SRS could effectively substitute for a more extensive procedure such as bicanalicular silicon intubation in patients with canalicular obstruction, particularly those with partial obstruction. The newly developed SRS intubation procedure has the advantages of simple, easy implementation and extubation, low cost, and a lower rate of trauma when compared with bicanalicular silicon intubation.
