The German-installed NDH government called on all Croats to <b>stop</b> <b>fighting,</b> and in the evening, LI Infantry Corps entered Zagreb and relieved the 14th Panzer Division.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{leadership}} of its commander, Armijski đeneral Petar Nedeljković, the mostly ethnic Serb remnants of the 4th Army attempted to establish defensive positions in northeastern Bosnia, but were brushed aside by the 14th Panzer Division as it drove east towards Sarajevo, which fell on 15 April. A ceasefire was agreed on that day, {{and the remains of}} the 4th Army were ordered to <b>stop</b> <b>fighting.</b> The Yugoslav Supreme Command surrendered unconditionally effective on 18 April.|$|E
5|$|Actually, {{the warning}} {{on the early}} flags {{was not meant to}} depict the timber {{rattlesnake}} as being ferocious or the American people as being warlike. The true message was that the citizens of the Colonies were a peaceable and freedom-loving people, but if England’s King George III continued with his oppressive policies toward the Colonies, then they would respond with great wrath. This response would be much like that of a timber rattlesnake, which is peaceable and slow to anger, but will attack aggressively when provoked and will not <b>stop</b> <b>fighting</b> until the enemy retreats.|$|E

5|$|Another one-party cabinet was {{announced}} in January 1992, which prompted large scale protests in Kigali, and finally forced Habyarimana to make real concessions. He promised {{for the first time}} to negotiate with the RPF; a multiparty cabinet formed in April, still dominated by the MRND, but with opposition figures in some key positions. The opposition members of this cabinet met with the RPF, and were successful in negotiating a ceasefire. In July 1992 the rebels agreed to <b>stop</b> <b>fighting,</b> and the parties began a peace negotiation process headquartered in the Tanzanian city of Arusha.|$|E
5|$|The Hòa Hảo {{initially}} {{engaged in}} large-scale clashes with the Việt Minh in 1945, but by mid-1946 {{the two groups}} had agreed to <b>stop</b> <b>fighting</b> each other and fight the French instead. However, in June 1946, Sổ became estranged from his military leaders and started the Dân Xã (Social Democratic Party). Because of his charisma, the Việt Minh saw Sổ as a threat and assassinated him, leaving the Hòa Hảo leaderless and causing Sổ's military leaders to go their separate ways. The split caused an increase in violence as the various Hòa Hảo factions engaged in conflicts among themselves.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of Mexican {{casualties}} {{range from}} one to three soldiers killed and from three to seven wounded. Approximately 20soldiers escaped. They warned the garrisons at Copano and Refugio of the advancing Texians; those garrisons abandoned their posts and joined the soldiers at Fort Lipantitlán. Milam escorted the remaining Mexican soldiers to Gonzales, where the newly formed Texian Army was located. The Texian Army commander, Stephen F. Austin, later released all of the men, {{on the condition that}} they leave Texas and vow to <b>stop</b> <b>fighting</b> Texas residents. One wounded Mexican soldier was allowed to remain in Goliad, as was Captain Manuel Sabriego, who was married to a local woman. In secret, Sabriego began organizing a group of settlers in the Goliad area who sympathized with Mexico.|$|E
50|$|The book {{argues that}} the pattern is sharply evident in for example 300 years of Ancient Greek history, the Swiss Cantons since the 14th century, in the County of Flanders during the 14th century, in the {{three and a half}} centuries of the Hanseatic League, and in Renaissance Italy. These periods {{included}} numerous societies that frequently changed regime type. The societies abruptly <b>stopped</b> <b>fighting</b> other oligarchies if they became an oligarchy and abruptly <b>stopped</b> <b>fighting</b> other democracies if they became a democracy. This pattern immediately reversed if the regime type changed again.|$|R

5|$|Held up by {{freezing}} {{weather and}} snow storms, on 10 April, {{on the following}} day LI Infantry Corps was approaching Zagreb from the north, and bicycle-mounted troops of the 183rd Infantry Division had turned east to capture Varaždin, along with an entire Yugoslav brigade including its commanding general. On the same day, the German-installed interim Croatian government called on all Croats to <b>stop</b> <b>fighting,</b> and in the evening, LI Infantry Corps entered Zagreb and relieved the 14th Panzer Division. In the face of the assault by the 14th Panzer Division, the 4th Army quickly ceased to exist as an operational formation. The disintegration of the 4th Army was caused largely by fifth column activity, as it was involved in little fighting.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 Lê Duẩn was {{appointed}} to the Secretariat. Lê Duẩn was ordered by the Politburo in August 1956 to guide the revolutionary struggle in South Vietnam. The same month he traveled from U Minh to Bến Tre and instructed the southern communists to <b>stop</b> <b>fighting</b> in the name of religious sects. Throughout the year, the party had been split by factional rivalry between party boss Trường Chinh and President Hồ, who was supported by Võ Nguyên Giáp. This rivalry focused on the issue of land reform in the North. Lê Duẩn remained neutral, allowing him to act as the First Secretary (head of the Communist Party) on Hồ's behalf in late 1956. In 1957, he was given a seat in the Politburo.|$|E

5|$|A {{division}} {{developed between}} the uprising's communist {{leadership and the}} nationalists participating. The nationalists recognised the uprising had been crushed and wanted to <b>stop</b> <b>fighting,</b> while the Partisans were determined to continue the struggle. In late 1941, the nationalists contacted the Italians and offered to help them fight the communists, who had since been renamed Partisans. The nationalistsincluding Đurišić, who was popular in his own Vasojević clan of northern Montenegrosubsequently withdrew into the hinterland. They sought to avoid provoking the Italians and protect the mountain villages if they were attacked. In northern Montenegro, there was a marked distinction between the communists and nationalists. The nationalists had closer ties with Serbia and possessed a frontier mentality towards Muslims. The communists wished to continue the uprising by turning against their class enemies. Ustaše manipulation of the Muslims in the Sandžak and the expulsion of Serbs from areas annexed by Albania made Đurišić and his Chetniks impatient to continue fighting the Italians. They subsequently turned on the Muslims and Albanians in the region. The uprising continued with reduced intensity until December 1941. In 1941, Đurišić was awarded the Order of Karađorđe's Star by the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{on the recommendation of}} Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović.|$|E
5|$|In 1456, Skanderbeg's ally, Janos Hunyadi, died, and his son, Mathias Corvinus, was crowned King of Hungary. Hunyadi {{had been}} an {{advocate}} for an offensive war against the Ottoman Empire, whereas the Hungarian nobility and his son promoted a defensive war. The next year, however, George Kastrioti Skanderbeg defeated a sizable Ottoman force at the Battle of Albulena (Ujëbardha). Rome had been desperately waiting for such a victory after the Siege of Belgrade, as Pope Calixtus III had wanted to assure himself of the feasibility of a crusade before declaring one. Calixtus thus named Skanderbeg the Captain-General of the Curia; to secure the pope's interests, Skanderbeg sent twelve Turkish prisoners of war that had been captured at Albulena to Rome. Despite seeing his forces defeated the year before, Sultan Mehmed II prepared another force to be sent into Albania. The country had been obstructing his ambitions for empire in the West and he grew restless to defeat Skanderbeg. Skanderbeg sent delegations to several Western European states to convince them to <b>stop</b> <b>fighting</b> each other and unite for Calixtus' crusade.|$|E
5|$|The Vance {{plan was}} {{designed}} to <b>stop</b> <b>fighting</b> in Croatia and allow negotiations to proceed without the impact of ongoing hostilities. It offered no political solutions in advance. The plan entailed the deployment of the 10,000-strong United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) to the three major conflict areas designated as UN Protected Areas (UNPAs). The plan listed specific municipalities that were {{to be included in}} each UNPA, but the exact borders of each UNPA were not defined clearly because several municipalities were only to be partially included. The task of defining the exact borders of each UNPA was delegated to the UN liaison officers deployed in advance, in co-operation with authorities in each area. Creation of the UNPAs was necessary for acceptance of the plan by Milošević and Tuđman. The Serb-dominated authorities of Yugoslavia originally requested the deployment of a UN force along a zone between Serb and Croatian areas, reflecting the Serb desire to see the peacekeeping force securing the confrontation lines. Croatia wanted the UN force deployed along its international borders. The UNPAs served to formally satisfy both parties.|$|E

5|$|The conference {{began in}} the evening of September 29, 1920. The Polish {{delegation}} was led by colonel Mieczysław Mackiewicz (who originated from Lithuania), and the Lithuanian delegation by general Maksimas Katche. Lithuania proposed an immediate armistice, but the Polish delegation refused. Only after the Lithuanian delegation threatened to leave the negotiation table did Poland agree to <b>stop</b> <b>fighting,</b> but only {{to the east of}} the Neman River (the Suwałki Region). Fighting {{to the west of the}} river continued. The Polish delegates demanded that the Lithuanians allow the Polish forces to use a portion of the Warsaw– Saint Petersburg Railway and the train station in Varėna (Orany). The Lithuanians refused: their major forces were concentrated in the Suwałki Region and moving them to protect Vilnius without the railway would be extremely difficult. The Lithuanian side was ready to give up the Suwałki Region in exchange for Poland's recognition of the Lithuanian claims to Vilnius.|$|E
5|$|Though {{they were}} influential, Pericles, Aspasia {{and their friends}} were not immune from attack, as preeminence in {{democratic}} Athens was not equivalent to absolute rule. Her relationship with Pericles and her subsequent political influence aroused many reactions. Donald Kagan, a Yale historian, believes that Aspasia was particularly unpopular {{in the years immediately}} following the Samian War. In 440 BC, Samos was at war with Miletus over Priene, an ancient city of Ionia in the foot-hills of Mycale. Worsted in the war, the Milesians came to Athens to plead their case against the Samians. When the Athenians ordered the two sides to <b>stop</b> <b>fighting</b> and submit the case to arbitration at Athens, the Samians refused. In response, Pericles passed a decree dispatching an expedition to Samos. The campaign proved to be difficult and the Athenians had to endure heavy casualties before Samos was defeated. According to Plutarch, it was thought that Aspasia, who came from Miletus, was responsible for the Samian War, and that Pericles had decided against and attacked Samos to gratify her.|$|E
5|$|Throughout April {{there were}} {{numerous}} attempts by UNAMIR to establish a ceasefire, but Kagame insisted each time that the RPF would not <b>stop</b> <b>fighting</b> unless the killings stopped. In late April, the RPF secured {{the whole of the}} Tanzanian border area and began to move west from Kibungo, to the south of Kigali. They encountered little resistance, except around Kigali and Ruhengeri. By 16 May they had cut the road between Kigali and Gitarama, the temporary home of the interim government, and by 13 June, had taken Gitarama itself. The taking of Gitarama followed an unsuccessful attempt by the FAR forces to reopen the road. The interim government was forced to relocate to Gisenyi in the far northwest. As well as fighting the war, Kagame recruited heavily at this time to expand the RPF. The new recruits included Tutsi survivors of the genocide and refugees from Burundi, but they were less well trained and disciplined than the earlier recruits.|$|E
