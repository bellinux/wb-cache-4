50|$|A global {{strategy}} may {{be appropriate}} in industries where firms are faced with strong pressures for cost reduction but with weak pressures for local responsiveness.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of marketing <b>standardized</b> <b>products</b> {{depends on the}} ability of the products to penetrate the cultural systems of the intended markets. A segmentation of markets into peripheral (culturally open) and central (culturally closed) consumption contexts makes it possible to identify structures which are receptive to foreign, unfamiliar products and structures which resist globalization. This segmentation principle may be a valuable help for the firm's strategic decisions about the product portfolio's composition of locally adapted and globally <b>standardized</b> <b>products.</b> The theoretical argument builds on data collected on the consumption context of furnishings in Britain, supplemented with Denmark, and the consumption contexts of food in the three Arab cities, Riyadh, Jedda and Dubai.

50|$|One {{major reason}} for {{vertical}} disintegration is to share risk. Also, in some cases, smaller firms can be more responsive to changes in market conditions.

5000|$|In {{order to}} make {{improvements}} himself, Ji Desheng tasted dozens of herbal ingredients commonly used for detoxification and pain reduction. Some of the ingredients have adverse effects when taken alone. When accidentally poisoned, Ji Desheng immediately took the antidotes taught by his father. With his intuition, experience, and repeated trials of ingredient tasting, {{he was able to}} determine the effectiveness and the performance of each herb he tried. He also courageously let snakes bite his shoulders, arms, and toes; when poisoned, he applied different medicines to the different types of wounds. Ji Desheng only applied the medicine onto his patients after testing out the medicine himself. After spending nearly 10 years of hard work, he finally achieved his long-cherished wish of producing a <b>standardized</b> <b>product.</b> The end product was produced by a crushing a variety of ingredients into powder then adding liquid to form a cake-shaped tablet 2.5 cm in diameter and 0.5 cm in thickness. The medicine also came in the shapes of pills. Each piece of the medicinal cake and pills were printed with a red Chinese character of [...] "Ji" [...] bearing the family name.|$|E
5000|$|Historian Kay Sloan {{has shown}} how various reformist groups made social problem shorts and {{features}} during the silent era. Generally, these dealt with prohibition, labor relations and concerns over [...] "white slavery." [...] The ideologies of these pre-World War I productions often aligned with {{concerns over the}} worker and the interaction filmmakers had with real world problems. This was important {{to the development of}} the genre as it was the first foray into displaying issues of the common man but wasn't successful in terms of offering a viable solution. Rather, the didactic nature of these films indicated an upper-middle class solution to labor issues; oftentimes it would take the presence of a non-working class negotiator to resolve the issues laborers in the films dealt with. The discovery of the effect of and utilization of the happy ending was also implemented during this time. The happy ending left a cathartic effect on its audience, leaving them satisfied with the social message being provided. This itself is an imperative to the social problem genre due to its demonstration of directors and filmmakers desire to affect social change through movies. As a genre, however, these Progressive statements did not touch off a long-lasting concern in the film industry, which was solidifying behind <b>standardized</b> <b>product,</b> oligopoly and the star system.|$|E
5000|$|Since the mid-1990s, {{a number}} of wine brands have {{switched}} to alternative wine closures such as plastic stoppers, screw caps, or other closures. During 1972 {{more than half of}} the Australian bottled wine went bad due to corking. A great deal of anger and suspicion was directed at Portuguese and Spanish cork suppliers who were suspected of deliberately supplying bad cork to non-EEC wine makers to help prevent cheap imports. Cheaper wine makers developed the aluminium [...] "Spelvin" [...] cap with a polypropylene stopper wad. More expensive wines and carbonated varieties continued to use cork, although much closer attention was paid to the quality. Even so, some high premium makers prefer the Spelvin as it is a guarantee that the wine will be good even after many decades of ageing. Some consumers may have conceptions about screw caps being representative of lower quality wines, due to their cheaper price; however, in Australia, for example, much of the non-sparkling wine production now uses these Spelvin caps as a cork alternative, although some have recently switched back to cork citing issues using screw caps. These alternatives to cork have both advantages and disadvantages. For example, screwtops are generally considered to offer a trichloroanisole (TCA) free seal, but they also reduce the oxygen transfer rate between the bottle and the atmosphere to almost zero, which can lead to a reduction in the quality of the wine. TCA is the main documented cause of cork taint in wine. However, some in the wine industry say natural cork stoppers are important because they allow oxygen to interact with wine for proper aging, and are best suited for wines purchased with the intent to age. Stoppers which resemble natural cork very closely can be made by isolating the suberin component of the cork from the undesirable lignin, mixing it with the same substance used for contact lenses and an adhesive, and molding it into a <b>standardized</b> <b>product,</b> free of TCA or other undesirable substances. [...] Composite corks with real cork veneers are used in cheaper wines.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} relationship of product adaptation and buyer behavior. By <b>standardizing</b> <b>products,</b> {{it was possible for}} organizations to produce in large scale and make them accessible for many different markets. Nevertheless, these different markets also have particularities which cannot be ignored and therefore, product adaptation is necessary to some extent; even for <b>standardized</b> <b>products.</b> Organizations should then optimize their product adaptation police in order to reach an assertive marketing strategy. In this regard, this study develops a model which predicts product adaptation from the understanding of buyer behavior. The understanding of buyer behavior, from the seller organization perspective, can provide organizations {{with a wide range of}} information to predict product adaptation.  It was concluded, by using the case of Volvo, that organizations can optimize their marketing strategy by predicting product adaptation from observing and understanding their buyer´s behavior looking at the following variables: environmental influences focusing as well on the industry and segment, organizational factors, motivational factors and the nature of decision-making. Besides these variables, the data coming from after-sale processes and trend reports also help to predict product adaptation...|$|R
