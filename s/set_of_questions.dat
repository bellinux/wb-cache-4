5|$|After the ten minutes, {{the first}} team comes on-stage, while the second team is placed in a sound-proof booth. The host then asks the team {{questions}} from the announced category. Each question is given, in rotation, to one player, who cannot confer with teammates. Both teams play the same <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions.</b> Each team has a total of 60 seconds to answer as many questions as possible, and the team that answers more questions correctly wins $20,000 for their charity; the runners-up win $5,000 for their charity. Teams that win this round advance to a semi-final game; the winners of that episode advance to the season finale, where the team that wins this round wins $100,000 for their charity {{as well as all}} winnings from previous episodes.|$|E
5|$|Other {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} detection of alcohol dependence, such as the Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire, which is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the CAGE questionnaire. It helps distinguish a diagnosis of alcohol dependence from one of heavy alcohol use. The Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST) is a screening tool for alcoholism widely used by courts to determine the appropriate sentencing for people convicted of alcohol-related offenses, driving under the influence being the most common. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), a screening questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization, is unique in that it has been validated in six countries and is used internationally. Like the CAGE questionnaire, it uses a simple <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> – a high score earning a deeper investigation. The Paddington Alcohol Test (PAT) was designed to screen for alcohol-related problems amongst those attending Accident and Emergency departments. It concords well with the AUDIT questionnaire but is administered in a fifth of the time. Certain blood tests may also indicate possible alcoholism.|$|E

25|$|In the 1920s Margaret Murray {{theorized that}} a Witchcraft {{religion}} existed underground and in secret, and had survived through the witchcraft prosecutions {{that had been}} enacted by the ecclesiastical and secular courts. Most historians now reject Murray's theory, as she based it partially upon the similarities of the accounts given by those accused of witchcraft; such similarity is now thought to actually derive from there having been a standard <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> {{laid out in the}} witch-hunting manuals used by interrogators.|$|E

There is no official <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions,</b> but topics such as the potential nominees’ legal scholarship, professional experience, writing ability, and community service are normally covered. The Commission also receives letters of recommendation and other background information on the candidates. Once the interviews are complete, the commission enters into discussion to reduce the list to the top six to eight nominees. Then the commission votes by secret ballot until a list of three nominees is chosen by majority vote to submit to the Governor.|$|E

A further <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions</b> were asked of the Comintern in letter dated 21 May 1920 by ILP Chairman Richard Wallhead and National Council member Clifford Allen. The Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) was asked for its positions on such matters as demands for rigid adherence to its program, applicability of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the Soviet system to Great Britain, and its view on the necessity of armed force as a universal principle.|$|E

30|$|To {{complement}} these prior {{efforts and}} {{examine the effect of}} different types <b>of</b> security <b>questions</b> on different categories of users’ recall/guessability performance (e.g., legitimate user, adversarial users), this paper explores the design space <b>of</b> dynamic security <b>questions</b> that are generated using users’ day-to-day activities captured by smartphones. Specifically, we evaluate the recall rate and guessability rate for different question types for different kinds of adversarial users (e.g., naive vs. knowledgeable) through a field study over a period of 30 days with 24 participants who were recruited in pairs to simulate different kinds of adversaries (e.g., close friends, significant others). Over the course of the study, each participant was periodically presented with three <b>sets</b> <b>of</b> challenge <b>questions.</b> The first <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>question</b> was generated based on participant’s own data. The second <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>question</b> was generated based on participant’s pair’s (e.g., close friend or couple) data. In this case, the role of strong adversary is played by the pair of each participant. Finally, the third <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>question</b> was generated based on a randomly selected participant’s data. In this case, participants played the role of naive adversary.|$|R

500|$|While {{philosophical}} thought {{pertaining to}} science dates {{back at least}} to the time of Aristotle, philosophy of science emerged as a distinct discipline only {{in the middle of the}} 20th century in the wake of the logical positivism movement, which aimed to formulate criteria for ensuring all philosophical statements' meaningfulness and objectively assessing them. Thomas Kuhn's landmark 1962 book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions was also formative, challenging the view of scientific progress as steady, cumulative acquisition of knowledge based on a fixed method of systematic experimentation and instead arguing that any progress is relative to a [...] "paradigm," [...] the <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>questions,</b> concepts, and practices that define a scientific discipline in a particular historical period.
