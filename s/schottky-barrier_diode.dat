50|$|In 1964, Dr. Biard {{designed}} linear transimpedance amplifiers (TIA) to {{work with}} silicon photodiodes for receiving optical signals generated by LEDs. When the signal current from the silicon photodiode was too large, the input stage of the amplifier would saturate and cause undesirable delays when the optical signal was removed. Dr. Biard solved this problem by connecting a silicon HP Schottky diode across the collector-base junction of the input transistor. Since the Schottky diode had a lower forward drop than the transistor PN junction, the transistor did not saturate and the undesirable delay time was eliminated. The engineer in the next office at the SRD Lab was developing Diode Transistor Logic (DTL) ICs and also having saturation problems. Dr. Biard decided to use what he learned with the optical receiver amplifiers and apply that to the bipolar logic circuits. On December 31, 1964, Dr. Biard filed a patent for the Schottky transistor (U.S. Patent US3463975), a.k.a. the Schottky-clamped transistor, which consisted of a transistor and an internal metal-semiconductor <b>Schottky-barrier</b> <b>diode.</b> The patent was filed based on Schottky Clamped DTL monolithic integrated logic circuits using aluminum-silicon Schottky diodes across the collector-base junctions of the transistors and in the input to adjust the logic levels. The diode prevented the transistor from saturating by minimizing the forward bias on the collector-base transistor junction, thus reducing the minority carrier injection to a negligible amount. The Schottky diode could be integrated on the same die, it had a compact layout, it had no minority carrier charge storage, and it was faster than a conventional junction diode. Dr. Biard's patent was filed before Transistor-transistor logic (TTL) circuits had been invented, yet it was written broadly {{enough to cover the}} Schottky clamped TTL ICs using platinum silicide Schottky diodes, which were much more predictable and manufacturable than the aluminum Schottky diodes he originally used. His patent ultimately improved the switching speed of saturated logic designs, such as the Schottky-TTL, at a low cost. In 1985, Dr. Biard received the Patrick E. Haggerty Innovation Award for this patent.|$|E

In this study, the application of bilayer graphene nanoribbon in <b>schottky-barrier</b> <b>diode</b> is explored due to its different stacking arrangements.

40|$|A microrectenna {{that would}} operate at a {{frequency}} of 2. 5 THz {{has been designed}} and partially fabricated. The circuit {{is intended to be}} a prototype of an extremely compact device {{that could be used to}} convert radio-beamed power to DC to drive microdevices (see Figure 1). The microrectenna (see Figure 2) circuit consists of an antenna, a diode rectifier and a DC output port. The antenna consists of a twin slot array in a conducting ground plane (denoted the antenna ground plane) over an enclosed quarter-wavelength-thick resonant cavity (denoted the reflecting ground plane). The circuit also contains a planar high-frequency low-parasitic <b>Schottky-barrier</b> <b>diode,</b> a low-impedance microstrip transmission line, capacitors, and contact beam leads. The entire 3 -D circuit is fabricated monolithically from a single GaAs wafer. The resonant cavity renders the slot radiation pattern unidirectional with a half-power beam width of about 65. A unique metal mesh on the rear of the wafer forms the backplate for the cavity but allows the GaAs to be wet etched from the rear surface of the twin slot antennas and ground plane. The beam leads protrude past the edge of the chip and are used both to mount the microrectenna and to make the DC electrical connection with external circuitry. The antenna ground plane and the components on top of it are formed on a 2 - m thick GaAs membrane that is grown in the initial wafer MBE (molecular beam epitaxy) process. The side walls of the antenna cavity are not metal coated and, hence, would cause some loss of power; however, the relatively high permittivity (epsilon= 13) of the GaAs keeps the cavity modes well confined, without the usual surface-wave losses associated with thick dielectric substrates. The <b>Schottky-barrier</b> <b>diode</b> has the usual submicron dimensions associated with THz operation and is formed in a mesa process above the antenna ground plane. The diode is connected at the midpoint of a microstrip transmission line, which is formed on 1 - m-thick SiO (permittivity of 5) laid down on top of the GaAs membrane. The twin slots are fed in phase by this structure. To prevent radio-frequency (RF) leakage past the slot antennas, low-loss capacitors are integrated into the microstrip transmission line at the edges of the slots. The DC current- carrying lines extend from the outer edges of the capacitors, widen approaching the edges of the chip, and continue past the edges of the chip to become the beam leads used in tacking down the devices.

The lower efficiency at the higher frequencies is due primarily to the mismatch between the laser radiation and the fixedâlength diode antenna. To demonstrate the tunability of the generated farâinfrared radiation, the laser sidebands were swept through absorption lines of HDO and H_ 2 CO near 600 and 800 GHz.

40|$|The {{scaling of}} Field Effect Transistor (FET) at {{nanoscale}} assures better {{performance of the}} device. The phenomenon of downsizing the device dimensions has led to challenges such as short channel effects, leakage current, interconnect difficulties, high power consumption and quantum effects. Therefore, new materials and device structures are needed as alternatives to overcome these challenges. In this research, an analytical model for Trilayer (ABA-stacked) Graphene Nanoribbon carrier statistics based on quantum confinement effect is presented. To this end, density of states, carrier concentration and ballistic conductance of Trilayer Graphene Nanoribbon (TGN) as an FET channel are modeled. Besides that, scaling behaviors of p-n junction, Homo junction, <b>Schottky-barrier</b> <b>diode</b> and Schottkybarrier FET based on the Graphene Nanoribbon application are analytically studied. This is demonstrated in the proposed structure of TGN Schottky-barrier FET that exhibits negligible short channel effects, improved on current, pragmatic threshold voltage, very good subthreshold slope, and fast transient between on-off states to meet the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) near-term guidelines. Therefore, the proposed model is suitable for a high speed switching application because the value of subthreshold slope for the proposed transistor {{is less than the}} ideal value of 60 mV/decade. A small value of subthreshold slope denotes a small change in the input bias which can modulate the output current and would lead to less power consumption.

The molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth of five ZnSSe/lTO thin films was handled using a ZnS and a Se source with the substrate temperature ranging from 270 to 330 Â°C. The structural perfection of the as-grown thin films was examined using various techniques including X-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscope (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). The MBE-grown ZnSSe/ITO thin films were found to have a preferred orientation along the normal direction of the (111) planes. A linear relationship between the lattice constant and the Se composition was revealed from the results of both XRD and XPS studies. The evaluated crystal sizes by XRD indicate a strong growth temperature dependence with the optimized temperature at about 290 Â°C. Both AFM and TEM measurements done on these thin films also indicate a similar growth temperature dependence. The sample grown at the optimized temperature has the smoothest surface with the lowest root mean square (rms) value of 1. 2 nm and its TEM cross-sectional micrograph shows a well defined columnar structure whose nucleation seems to be highly correlated with the ITO grains. Photoresponse measurements done on these thin films show that UV responsivity as high as 0. 01 A/W at 390 nm and more than three orders of magnitude in rejection power for wavelength longer than 450 nm can be achieved. The results of both the dc resistivity and ac impedance measurements indicate that the electrical parameters of the thin film grown at the optimized temperature can provide a good matching with the liquid crystal layer of a Liquid Crystal Light Valve (LCLV) device. Regarding to the other approach, a novel 8 x 8 photodiode array based on a MBE-grown ZnS <b>Schottky-barrier</b> <b>diode</b> structure was fabricated using a newly developed micro-electronic processing scheme. The discrete detector was characterized to have a cutoff wavelength at 340 nm and a responsivity as high as 0. 18 A/W at 330 nm in the UV spectral range from 340 down to 250 nm.

This research project deals with the theoretical analysis as well as the experimental verifications of the harmonic generating properties of a nonlinear resistive device, i. e. <b>Schottky-barrier</b> <b>diode.</b> Laboratory measurements associated with the equivalent circuit representation of hot-carrier diodes show that their i-v characteristics can be accurately described by the modified exponential law, i = I(_s) [exp Î± (VâiR(_T) - 1, over a wide range of the applied voltage V. Using this equation, a procedure is developed for the harmonic analysis of the resistive diode and calculation of any of a finite number of harmonic currents having a single frequency sinusoidal voltage V(_p) cos w(_p) t as the drive. The amplitudes of the harmonic currents are expressed as a power series in Î±R(_T) I(_S)) exp (Î±R(_T) I(_S)) where the coefficients of the power series are represented through the modified Bessel function of the k(^th) of order n. The integers k and n represent the power of the series and the harmonic number respectively, e. g. i(_n) Î± I(_n) (k Î± v(_p)) [Î±R(_T) I(_S) exp (Î±R(_T) I(_S)) ](^k). The power series solutions for the exponential diodes do not normally converge quickly enough to be of practical value for numerical evaluations. A different approach is proposed which is suitable for numerical evaluations of harmonic amplitudes. The results are compared with experimental data on twelve diodes, four {{in each of the three}} groups of different types. A good agreement, within the measuring instruments tolerances, was found between the calculated and the experimental results. Finally, it is believed that such studies were justified as the new method of approach presented here evaluates fully the capabilities of these diodes in practice. Many analyses published over the years have tended to introduce severe approximations which were only valid in practice over limited ranges of operation. In this project, attempts were made over almost two years to obtain mathematical solutions for the exponential diode law which are useful in practice and which give accurate prediction of harmonic amplitudes and spectrum. Various methods were employed to achieve the necessary convergence of the infinite series solutions. This involved a good understanding of the mathematical methods employed and computer programming. During the same period at every stage experimental verifications were being attempted, many times unsuccessfully, which finally led to a good agreement between the theory and experimental results as shown in this thesis...|$|E
