Because of the infeasibility problem associated with the <b>super-efficiency</b> DEA model, ranking has been restricted to the model where constant returns to scale and proportional changes in all inputs or all outputs are assumed. In fact, when <b>super-efficiency</b> is used as an efficiency stability measure, infeasibility means the highest <b>super-efficiency.</b> However, if <b>super-efficiency</b> is interpreted as input saving or output surplus achieved by a specific efficient DMU, infeasibility does not necessarily mean the highest <b>super-efficiency.</b> In order to obtain a complete ranking of efficient DMUs when the two assumptions are relaxed, a modified <b>super-efficiency</b> DEA model is proposed to overcome the infeasibility problem and to correctly capture the <b>super-efficiency</b> represented by the input saving or the output surplus.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the <b>super-efficiency</b> model (SE-CCR), {{which is one}} of the most important modifications of the classic CCR model, and describes the main analytical capabilities of the SE-CCR model. Some of these capabilities are direct equivalents to the capabilities of the CCR model, e. g. defining benchmarks, identifying types of scale economies for inefficient objects, constructing target technologies, using simplex reports in the sensitivity analysis of the solution proposed by the SE-CCR model. Other analytical capabilities of the SE-CCR model are specific to the <b>super-efficiency</b> model. Since the SE-CCR model is a generalization of the CCR model, it provides more information and is more general than the classical approach. Everything that can be done using the CCR model can also be achieved by the SE-CCR model.
