5|$|By 1940, at {{the dawn}} of the freeway era, the state was making plans to convert the Bayshore Highway into a ten-lane Bayshore Freeway between <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> and Palo Alto. The first piece built was from Peninsula Avenue at the San Mateo-Burlingame line to South <b>San</b> <b>Francisco.</b> This six-lane freeway, {{completed}} in 1949, followed the existing highway to Broadway in Burlingame, but then took a more inland alignment past the <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> International Airport, and crossed the old road at South <b>San</b> <b>Francisco,</b> running just east of it to near the south end of the cut at Sierra Point. Construction began inside <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> in 1950 and was completed in 1958; the new causeway across Candlestick Cove, connecting the completed section in South <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> with <b>San</b> <b>Francisco,</b> was dedicated in mid-1957.
