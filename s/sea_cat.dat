5|$|The {{battalion}} began reforming near Ravenshoe, on the Atherton Tablelands in April 1944. During {{this time}} {{the composition of the}} units of the 9th Division underwent significant changes as many men were discharged due to medical reasons or transferred to other units and young replacements were brought in; many of the battalion's original members had been struck down by sickness during the fighting in New Guinea. A long period of training followed during which the battalion undertook a number of exercises, including amphibious operations with British Royal Marines on the Glenearn and Empire Spearhead. Finally, following more than a year training in Australia the battalion was committed to its final deployment of the war, moving to Morotai Island in April 1945 in order {{to take part in the}} landing on Tarakan as part of Operation Oboe. Embarking from Cairns, the battalion was transported in two ships, the <b>Sea</b> <b>Cat</b> and the Van Heutz, the battalion arrived on Morotai later in the month, where the battalion undertook a series of manoeuvres, exercising with armour and at night, to prepare them for the coming campaign. On 22 April, the battalion embarked upon HMAS Manoora, practicing beach landings for a week before setting sail for their objective.|$|E

The Belgrano accidentally rammed her sister ship Nueve de Julio on exercises in 1956, which resulted in damage to both. Belgrano was outfitted with the <b>Sea</b> <b>Cat</b> anti-aircraft missile system between 1967 and 1968.|$|E

Her anti-aircraft outfit consisted of six 40 mm Bofors; two single mountings on the forward superstructure, and two twin mountings on the aft superstructure. Four [...] Browning machine guns were carried for point defence. Five 21-inch torpedo tubes were fitted {{to a single}} Mark IV pentad mount on the deck between the forward and aft superstructures. For anti-submarine warfare, a Limbo anti-submarine mortar was carried on the aft deck, offset to port. The twin Bofors, torpedo launcher, and Limbo mortar were all removed during various refits. A <b>Sea</b> <b>Cat</b> missile system was installed {{at some point during}} her career.|$|E

5|$|There are 150 unique {{players on}} 18 teams, each with {{thematic}} personalities in appearance, play style, and profanity. Teams also vary in skill set, and attributes such as defense, speed, strength, and teamwork. Examples include the <b>Sea</b> <b>Cats</b> (fast all-female team with European accents), the Marines (who wear camouflaged garb and use military jargon), the Demons (high strength attribute with demonic language), and the Black Dragons (ninjas with high agility and combat skills). Teams battle in 32 arenas—one half with traditional, open-style stadiums, {{and the other}} half with environmental obstacles, such as the underground mines. Minor power-ups including health, credits, and skill augments for individual players regenerate regularly on the field.|$|R
50|$|Some sailors {{believed}} that polydactyl cats were better at catching pests, possibly {{connected with the}} suggestion that extra digits give a polydactyl cat better balance, important when at <b>sea.</b> <b>Cats</b> were believed to have miraculous powers that could protect ships from dangerous weather. Another popular belief was that cats could start storms through magic stored in their tails. If a ship's cat fell or was thrown overboard, {{it was thought that}} it would summon a terrible storm to sink the ship and that if the ship was able to survive, it would be cursed with nine years of bad luck. Other beliefs included: if a cat licked its fur against the grain, it meant a hailstorm was coming; if it sneezed it meant rain; and if it was frisky it meant wind.|$|R
5000|$|CityJet was {{launched}} when Tranzglobal Holdings, a freight airline operator, decided {{to establish a}} low-cost passenger service, competing with Air New Zealand, Ansett New Zealand, and Origin Pacific Airways. It {{was set up by}} Paul Webb and Steve Mosen. CityJet operated in the Cook Strait area, having a hub in Wellington and serving Nelson, Blenheim, and Palmerston North. Auckland, Hamilton, New Zealand and later Christchurch were served. The airline's fleet was based on the Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante. The airline operated passenger flights during the day then removed the seats to operate freight flights at night. The airfares were very cheap at only $29 and undercut the cheapest at Air New Zealand and Ansett New Zealand which were $89 at the time. The fares were also cheaper than the three ferry operators; The new Top Cat service had a $35 introductory fare, Cook Strait <b>Sea</b> <b>Cat's</b> fare was $49, while the Interislander fare cost $46 and the Lynx fast ferry $59.|$|R

50|$|To the company's disappointment, {{this first}} {{agreement}} {{did not bring}} an end to problems with fishermen. Since Chisso had switched the wastewater output from Minamata Bay to the mouth of Minamata River in September 1958 the environmental damage had spread even further up and down the Shiranui <b>Sea.</b> <b>Cats</b> had started to die in Ashikita to the north and in Izumi to the south of Minamata and new Minamata disease patients were also appearing. The pollution was having a widespread effect on fishing catches and fish sales as people's confidence in the safety of their food evaporated. This drove the Kumamoto Prefectural Alliance of Fishing Cooperatives to take action of a similar pattern to that taken by the Minamata Fishing Alliance earlier in the year, but on a larger scale. On 17 October, 1,500 fishermen from the alliance descended on the factory demanding direct negotiations with Chisso. When company officials refused, the fishermen forced their way into the factory and attacked the security office, breaking windows and injuring seven guards. Alliance president Ushita Murakami delivered their demands to company manager Nishida, who promised a prompt reply. When the response came, the company said that since the factory's waste had still not been proven as the cause of Minamata disease, and it could offer the fishermen nothing.|$|R

40|$|Regulatory {{sequences}} {{of a sea}} urchin cytoskeletal actin gene (CyIIIa) were ligated to the bacterial gene coding for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT; acetyl-CoA:chloramphenicol O 3 -acetyltransferase, EC 2. 3. 1. 28) and the construct was injected into unfertilized <b>sea</b> urchin eggs. <b>CAT</b> activity is detected at the early blastula stage, when transcripts of the endogenous CyIIIa gene normally appear. Our measurements show that during activation the amount of CAT enzyme increases at least 100 -fold; that there are present in late blastula stage embryos about 5 X 10 (5) molecules of CAT mRNA (i. e., approximately 6 {{times the number of}} endogenous CyIIIa mRNAs); and that within the range studied the amount of CAT enzyme produced is independent of the number of CyIIIa-CAT genes incorporated per embryo, probably because the genes are present in excess of factors required for their activation. Activation of the CyIIIa-CAT construct is seriously inhibited, or abolished, by successive deletions of upstream CyIIIa sequences...|$|R
50|$|The {{islands are}} surface {{projections}} of the three oceanic Bahama Banks - the Little Bahama Bank, the Great Bahama Bank, and the westernmost Cay Sal Bank. The highest point is only 63 m above <b>sea</b> level on <b>Cat</b> Island; the island of New Providence, where {{the capital city of}} Nassau is located, reaches a maximum elevation of only thirty-seven meters. The land on the Bahamas has a foundation of fossil coral, but much of the rock is oolitic limestone; the stone is derived from the disintegration of coral reefs and seashells. The land is primarily either rocky or mangrove swamp. Low scrub covers much of the surface area. Pineyards are found on four of the northern islands: Grand Bahama, Great Abaco, New Providence, and Andros. On some of the southern islands, low-growing tropical hardwood flourishes. Although some soil is very fertile, it is also very thin. Only a few freshwater lakes and just one river, located on Andros Island, are found in the Bahamas.|$|R

5000|$|In contrast, {{the supernatural}} powers {{ascribed}} to black cats were sometimes viewed positively; for example, sailors considering a [...] "ship's cat" [...] would want a black one {{because it would}} bring good luck. Sometimes, fishermen's wives would keep black cats at home too, {{in the hope that}} {{they would be able to}} use their influence to protect their husbands at <b>sea</b> (see Ship's <b>cat).</b> The view of black cats being favorable creatures is attributed specifically to the Egyptian goddess Bast (or Bastet), the cat goddess. Egyptian households believed they could gain favor from Bastet by hosting black cats in their household. This view was held in the early 17th century by the English monarch Charles I. Upon the death of his treasured pet black cat, he is said to have lamented that his luck was gone. True to his claim, he was arrested the very next day and charged with high treason.|$|R

But the cat was too quick for him; he dodged the blows, then knocked the stick out of his hand, and finally Martin, to escape from him, crept into a crevice in a rock where the cat could not reach him, and refused to come out even when the Lady of the Hills came to look for him and begged him to come to her. When at last, compelled by hunger, he returned to her, he was silent and sullen and would not be caressed.|$|R
