At nightfall, combat ceased and Blücher opted for an exhausting night march in order to take his remaining forces to safety.|$|E
5|$|Cather {{discussed}} her authorship {{privately with}} her father and friends, but otherwise said {{she was not the}} author. She was reluctant to discuss most of her work before O Pioneers! (1913). According to L. Brent Bohlke, editor of Willa Cather in Person (1990), Cather regarded the Eddy book as poorly written. While it contains <b>some</b> <b>excellent</b> writing and character analysis, Bohkle wrote, it is not well-structured; the editing had failed to rid the book of the serialized nature of the McClure's pieces. Stouck adds that Cather wanted to distance herself from journalism, and sought to minimize her role in the articles because they had angered the Christian Science church.|$|E
