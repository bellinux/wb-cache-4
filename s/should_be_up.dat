25|$|The charity {{group has}} {{collaborated with the}} New Zealand Veterinary Association on a {{campaign}} against the tail docking of dogs. The SPCA claimed tail docking was an outdated and cosmetic practice which offered no benefits but causes unnecessary pain to the animal. The New Zealand Kennel Club purported there was no scientific evidence to support any of the SPCA's claims and said tail docking <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> to owners' preference. No decision was ever passed into law.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to questions {{as to whether or}} not vaccines cause autism, Price stated in January 2017 “I think the science in that instance is that it does not”. Price said in March 2017 that it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> to individual states to determine whether vaccinations should be required - a position that is in keeping with current U.S. law, which does not require vaccinations on a federal level. All fifty states do however, have laws requiring that children in public schools be vaccinated.|$|E

500|$|Seizing an axe, Batman hacks {{down the}} front door of the asylum, proclaiming that the inmates are now free. The Joker offers to put him out of his misery. Batman {{retrieves}} Two-Face's coin from Adams and returns it to him, stating that it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> to Two-Face to decide Batman's fate. Two-Face declares that they will kill Batman if the coin lands scratched side up, but let him go if the unscarred side appears. Two-Face flips the coin and declares Batman free. The Joker bids Batman good-bye, taunting him by saying that should life ever become too much for him in [...] "the asylum" [...] (the outside world) then he always has a place in Arkham. As Batman disappears into the night, Two-Face stands looking at the coin and it is revealed that it actually landed scratched side up; Two-Face chose to free Batman with his own will. He then turns to the stack of tarot cards and recites a passage from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland: [...] "Who cares for you? You're nothing but a pack of cards." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nevada {{politicians}} can (and generally do) play {{both sides}} of the prostitution dispute by declaring that they are personally opposed to prostitution but feel it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> to the counties to decide. [...] As almost three-quarters of the population of Nevada lives in a single county (Clark County, where prostitution is illegal), county control over local matters is a hot-button issue. Legislators from the northern counties will often reflexively oppose what is seen as [...] "meddling" [...] from the majority in the south, and the legislators from the south have been too divided on the issue to push through a state-wide ban.|$|E
2500|$|Although these {{specific}} indicia of California's intent in enacting 25524.2 {{are subject to}} varying interpretation, there are two further reasons why we should not become embroiled in attempting to ascertain California's true motive. First, inquiry into legislative motive is often an unsatisfactory venture. United States v. O'Brien, 391 [...] U.S. 367, 383 (1968). What motivates one legislator {{to vote for a}} statute is not necessarily what motivates scores of others to enact it. Second, it would be particularly pointless for us to engage in such inquiry here when {{it is clear that the}} States have been allowed to retain authority over the need for electrical generating facilities easily sufficient to permit a State so inclined to halt the construction of new nuclear plants by refusing on economic grounds to issue certificates of public convenience in individual proceedings. In these circumstances, it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> to Congress to determine whether a State has misused the authority left in its hands.|$|E

Indeed, George himself had suggested half-past four, but Harris and I had argued that five would be early enough as an average; that would enable us to be on our machines by six, and to break {{the back of our}} journey before {{the heat of the day}} set in. Occasionally we might start a little earlier, but not as a habit.|$|E
60|$|Dolores did {{not seem}} to want to talk.

She knew that her aunt and cousins were far less severe with her than she expected, but that could only be because she was ill. Had not Uncle Reginald turned against her, and Constance?

60|$|May 27.--A sleepless night. It is time I <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> and be doing, and a sleepless night {{sometimes}} furnishes good ideas. Alas! I have no companion {{now with}} whom I can communicate {{to relieve the}} loneliness of these watches of the night. But I must not fail myself and my family--and the necessity of exertion becomes apparent. I must try a hors d'oeuvre, something that can go on between the necessary intervals of Nap. Mrs. M[urray] K[eith's] Tale of the Deserter, with her interview with the lad's mother, may be made most affecting, but will hardly endure much expansion.[274] The framework may be a Highland tour, under the guardianship {{of the sort of}} postilion, whom Mrs. M.K. described to me--a species of conductor who regulated the motions of his company, made their halts, and was their cicerone.|$|E
60|$|Sally took Thorn by the {{shoulders}} and thrust him out, but he left me with sufficient, and unpleasant, food for reflection. The stock I had counted on were gone. Also, when it was above all things desirable that I <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> and doing, I must lie still for weeks, useless as a log. One thing at least I saw clearly, and that was the usurer's purpose to absorb my property; and as I lay with throbbing forehead and tight-clenched fingers, which had grown strangely white, I determined that he should have cause to remember the struggle before he accomplished it. That Redmond had been driven by him into shameful treachery appeared too probable, though there was no definite proof of it, and the thought stiffened my resolution. My scattered neighbors, patient as they were, were ill to coerce and would doubtless join me in an effort before the schemer's machinations left us homeless.|$|E

He was urgent that I should come and live with him and marry. I told him I would, with all my heart, when I had found you, and he saw I was too much in earnest to be opposed.

60|$|This {{lady was}} of the same opinion that has {{animated}} many illustrious philosophers, namely, that the affairs of this world need {{a great deal of}} seeing to in order to have them go on prosperously; and although she did not, like them, engage in the supervision of the universe, she made amends by unremitting diligence in the department under her care. In her mind there was an evident necessity that every one <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> and doing: Monday, because it was washing day; Tuesday, because it was ironing day; Wednesday, because it was baking day; Thursday, because to-morrow was Friday; and so on {{to the end of the}} week. Then she had the care of reminding all in the house of every thing each was to do from week's end to week's end; and she was so faithful in this respect, that scarcely an original act of volition took place in the family. The poor deacon was reminded when he went out and when he came in, when he sat down and when he rose up, so that an act of omission could only have been committed through sheer malice prepense.|$|E
6000|$|John gave vent to {{an opinion}} which {{contained}} deeper truths than, at that time, he thought of. God {{has given to}} men their varied powers and inclinations, in order that they may use these powers and follow these inclinations. Working rightly, man is a perfect machine: it is only [...] "the fall" [...] which has twisted all things awry. There is no sin in feeling an intense desire for violent physical action, or in gratifying that desire when we can do so {{in accordance with the}} revealed will of God; but there is sin in gratifying it in a wrong way; in committing burglary for instance, or in prize-fighting, or in helping others to fight in a cause with which we have no right to interfere. Again, it is not wrong to desire peace and quiet, and to wish for mental and spiritual and physical repose; but it is decidedly wrong to stand by with your hands in your pockets when an innocent or helpless one is being assaulted by ruffians; to sit quiet and do nothing when your neighbour's house is on fire; to shirk an unpleasant duty and leave some one else to do it; or to lie a-bed when you <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>up</b> and at work.|$|E

He had told himself that he was not to speak of his love again till the two months were over, and like an honourable man he was prepared to wait the full time. He would not now have come to the attorney's house but that he knew the attorney would wait for him before going over to the club. He had no right to draw deductions till the time <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>up.</b> But he could not help his own feelings and was aware that his heart sank within him when he was told that Cheltenham was a nasty idle place. Abuse of Cheltenham at the present moment was in fact abuse of Mary;--and the one sin which Mary could commit was persistence in her rejection of his suit. But he determined to be a man as he walked across the street with his old friend, and said not a word about his love. [...] "They tell me that Goarly has taken his 7s. 6d., Mr. Masters." ...|$|E
