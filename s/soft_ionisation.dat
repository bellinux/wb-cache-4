The apparatus is capable of measuring the size as well as the chemical composition, by the use of Laser Desorption/Ionisation (LDI), of an aerosol particle. A drawback of LDI principle is the direct ionisation mechanism, causing extensive break-up of large biological molecules and thereby losing characteristic information. Interest in, and the ability of, detection of large molecules of biological origin has increased since Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation (MALDI) mass spectrometry has shown that mass spectra of bacteria and spores can be used for identification of bacterial species and even bacterial strains. In MALDI-systems a matrix material has been applied which is able to absorb the energy of an ionisation pulse. The energy is released as heat to the aerosol particle, resulting into a <b>softer</b> <b>ionisation,</b> than is the case by traditional LDI.

We find that the warm absorbers of nearby Seyferts and certain QSOs are most likely to originate in outflows from the dusty torus, and that the kinetic luminosity of these outflows accounts for well under 1 % of the bolometric luminosities of the AGN. Our analysis supports, however, the view that the relativistic outflows recently observed in two PG quasars have their origin in accretion disc winds, although the energetic importance of these outflows {{is similar to that of}} the Seyfert warm absorbers.

Unfortunately, many possible biomarkers detected in metabolic profiling experiments cannot be identified {{due to the lack}} of reference spectra for a majority of biologically relevant compounds. Therefore, many possible biomarkers remain “unknowns” up till now. Hyphenating gas chromatography with high resolution TOF-MS technology with <b>soft</b> atmospheric pressure <b>ionisation</b> (APCI) can preserve the molecular ion information and delivers accurate mass and isotopic pattern information. This data enables a sum formula generation for known and unknown target compounds. Additionally, optionally acquired MS/ MS data can extend the capabilities for structural elucidation. Mass accuracy, resolution and isotopic fidelity are independent of the TOFMS acquisition rate. Therefore, these instruments can be coupled to gas chromatography, which typically delivers narrow peak width requiring fast MS scan speeds. Corynebactrium glutamicum, a gram positive, nontoxic bacterium, is used in the industrial production of amino acids like lysine and glutamate. C. glutamicum can be grown on different carbon sources.

However, these studies could not provide information about the changing distribution of species at increasing Cu(I) levels. To address this, electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry using <b>soft</b> <b>ionisation</b> was applied to CopZ under native conditions. Data revealed folded, monomeric CopZ in apo- and Cu(I) -bound forms, along with Cu(I) -bound dimeric forms of CopZ at higher Cu(I) loading. Cu 4 (CopZ) 2 was the major dimeric species at loadings > 1 Cu(I) /CopZ, indicating the cooperative formation of the tetranuclear Cu(I) -bound species. As the principal low molecular weight thiol in B. subtilis, bacillithiol (BSH) {{may play a role}} in copper homeostasis. Mass spectrometry showed that increasing BSH led to a reduction in Cu(I) -bound dimeric forms, and the formation of S-bacillithiolated apo-CopZ and BSH adducts of Cu(I) -bound forms of CopZ, where BSH likely acts as a Cu(I) ligand. These data, along with the high affinity of BSH for Cu(I), determined here to be β 2 (BSH) = ∼ 4 × 1017 M− 2, are consistent with a role for BSH alongside CopZ in buffering cellular Cu(I) levels.

Here we discuss one of the most recent additions to the armory of techniques used by chemists to interrogate metal complex/ DNA interactions. For the majority of its existence mass spectrometry (MS) has proven to be of enormous advantage to chemists by virtue of its ability to provide the molecular weights of compounds as well as structural information via fragmentation patterns. However, the high energies associated with many earlier MS techniques which result in fragmentation of covalent bonds, prevent its application for studying weaker intermolecular interactions. The advent of <b>soft</b> <b>ionisation</b> methods such as matrix assisted laser desorption ionisation (MALDI) and electrospray ionisation (ESI) has revolutionised mass spectrometric analysis of biomolecules, by allowing these normally fragile molecules to be introduced into the gas phase for analysis with minimal, if any, fragmentation.

This was confirmed by a number of early studies involving organic intercalators and minor groove binding ligands, prompting our interest in evaluating ESI–MS as a tool for studying non-covalent interactions between metal complexes and DNA.

Prolyl oligopeptidase family enzymes are proteases characterised by their unique function; these enzymes are only capable of digesting short amino acid sections of no more than thirty amino acids. These proteins have been implicated in a number of neurological disorders and have been targeted as potential drug candidates. PREP is an 80. 7 kDa monomeric protein that has been targeted as a potential drug candidate. PREP has been crystallised in two distinct conformations, open and closed, and {{it has been suggested that}} the protein exists in equilibrium between the two states in solution, with only the open conformation allowing substrate entry via a domain separation mechanism. Ion mobility mass spectrometry has been used to confirm the presence of both conformations, and to investigate the effect of ligand binding on conformation. It was found that, at lower energy states, PREP was only capable of adopting a single conformation, and that more extended conformations were only present following activation of the protein. Binding of ligand appeared to increase the relative stability of the protein. DPP IV, is a larger, dimeric, protein from the same family. Unlike PREP, DPP IV has only been crystallised in a single conformation and it was proposed that small loop movements, rather than domain separation, allowed substrate entry. Ion mobility measurements show only a single conformation of DPP IV, consistent with no large conformational changes, supporting this hypothesis.

A novel technique was applied on the preservation of Botrytis cinerea (MUM 10. 163, 10. 165, 10. 167), Aspergillus ibericus (MUM 04. 68) and Aspergillus brasiliensis (MUM 06. 181) using the methodology of alginate encapsulation, in two different conditions: distilled water (I) and a 10 % glycerol solution (II), both at 4 ºC for 1 year; the viability of these strains was studied. The assessment was made by comparison with the method of Castellani preservation in water (III), using morphologic and MALDI-TOF ICMS analyses for the analysis of the 3 preservation methods. The encapsulated samples of the strains preserved in distilled water (I), presented lower viability than those preserved in 10 % glycerol (II). However, when comparing the growth from the samples preserved in water (III) with the ones encapsulated and maintained in 10 % glycerol (II), we noted that the last ones presented a healthier and faster growth. From the MALDI-TOF ICMS analysis, it was observed that the strains were clustered according to species identification, and for Botrytis cinerea all presented small differences ( 5 %) when preserved in water (III). From our evaluation we were able to conclude that the success of the preservation method is strain dependent.

40|$|The functionalisation of {{surfaces}} by {{the transformation}} of structurally simple molecules is one challenge of chemical research. The introduction of a specific functional group is an essential step towards this aim. Amino groups are very valuable {{because they can be}} used as linkers to connect complex molecules to the surface. One important aim of my thesis is to identify electron-induced reactions that lead to an attachment of such functional groups to simpler molecules. Previous studies had suggested that radicals produced under low-energy electron exposure of molecular films deposited on surfaces undergo further reactions that lead to activation of adjacent molecules and recombination with remaining radicals. We thus attempted to trigger a similar reaction that would introduce amino groups into a hydrocarbon by an electron-induced dissociation of NH 3 yielding NH 2 and H fragments in a mixture of NH 3 with other molecules like ethane (C 2 H 6). H was assumed to activate C 2 H 6 by abstraction of another H so that, subsequently, the NH 2 fragment could recombine with the resulting C 2 H 5 fragment to produce C 2 H 5 NH 2. Similarly, radicals produced by dissociation of the other molecules were also expected to recombine with NH 2. In my thesis, it is shown that, instead of initiating the expected reactions, electron exposure of NH 3 as pure film and in mixtures leads to production of N 2 and desorption of both the starting material and the product. If, on the other hand, ethylene is used as a hydrocarbon component, exposure at energies above the ionisation threshold leads to formation of C 2 H 5 NH 2. This reaction is reminiscent of a hydroamination known from organic chemistry with the difference that the electron replaces the catalyst used in the organic synthesis. The latter is required to lower the activation barrier that results from the electrostatic repulsion between neutral C 2 H 4 and NH 3. This repulsion can also be eliminated by ionisation of one of the reaction partners. Therefore, the present finding provides evidence that <b>soft</b> <b>ionisation</b> is an alternative strategy to control the outcome of electron-induced reactions. In my work it is shown that a similar reaction can be used for the functionalisation of a self-assembled monolayer...|$|E
