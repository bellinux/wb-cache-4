5000|$|The main {{importance}} of this scheme is that it provides a method that will generate the grid automatically. Using this method, grids are segmented into blocks according {{to the surface of}} the element and a structure is provided to ensure appropriate connectivity. To interpret the data flow solver is used. When an unstructured scheme is employed, the main interest is to fulfill the demand of the user and a grid generator is used to accomplish this task. The information storage in <b>structured</b> <b>scheme</b> is cell to cell instead of grid to grid and hence the more memory space is needed. Due to random cell location, the solver efficiency in unstructured is less as compared to the <b>structured</b> <b>scheme.</b>|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{increased}} interest in <b>structured</b> <b>schemes</b> {{for the assessment of}} risk for aggression within inpatient psychiatric settings. The most commonly utilized schemes are those previously developed to assess risk for prisoners being considered for release on parole and for forensic psychiatric patients being considered for discharge from the hospital to the community. Few <b>structured</b> <b>schemes</b> have been developed with the explicit aim of assessing risk for aggression in the inpatient setting. Recent research utilising a variety of risk assessment schemes has revealed reasonable predictive validity. This narrative review summarizes and appraises this expanding literature within the context of risk assessment decision making tasks typically undertaken by psychiatric unit staff. It is concluded that a number of <b>structured</b> risk assessments <b>schemes</b> do have acceptable predictive validity. Unfortunately, many of the schemes tested are compromised by a lack of practical utility, and only a few are capable of contributing to the entire range of risk assessment decision making tasks required.

40|$|We {{address a}} new error-resilient scheme for broadcast-quality {{interactive}} MPEG- 2 video streams to be transmitted over lossy packet networks. A new scene-complexity adaptive mechanism, namely Adaptive MPEG- 2 Information Structuring and Protection (AMISP) is introduced. AMISP lies on an information <b>structuring</b> <b>scheme</b> which modulates {{the number of}} resynchronization points (i. e., slice headers and intra-coded macroblocks) {{in order to maximize}} the perceived video quality. The video quality the end-user experiences depends both {{on the quality of the}} compressed video before transmission and on the degradation due to packet loss. Therefore, the <b>structuring</b> <b>scheme</b> constantly determines the best compromise between the rate allocated to encoding pure video information and the rate aiming at reducing the sensitivity to packet loss. It is then extended with a Forward Error Correction (FEC) based protection algorithm to become AMISP. AMISP triggers the insertion of FEC packets in the MPEG- 2 video pa [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Structured {{programming}} {{has been}} studied recently {{in the context of}} program schemes. It is in this setting that we wish to examine the question of the "inefficiency 2 ̆ 7; of structured programs. In particular, we study the "intrinsic size 2 ̆ 7; of <b>structured</b> program <b>schemes</b> when compared to equivalent nonstructured schemes. The notion of equivalence used is the one requiring equivalent schemes to compute the same function for each interpretation of their common operator and predicate symbols. To study the "intrinsic size 2 ̆ 7; of a <b>structured</b> <b>scheme,</b> we examine the size of a smallest equivalent <b>structured</b> <b>scheme,</b> and compare this with the size of a smallest equivalent nonstructured scheme. The general class of schemes studied in the present paper is the class of Ianov schemes, and the "structured 2 ̆ 7; schemes considered are the so-called Dijkstra schemes. The primary result is, from some points of view, a negative one: the intrinsic size of Dijkstra schemes may be exorbitant. To be precise, we construct a sequence F_n of Dijkstra schemes such that for each n, no smaller Dijkstra scheme is equivalent to F_n, and the number of edges in F_n grows exponentially. We then show there are weak equivalent nonstructured schemes G_n whose size grows only linearly...|$|R

40|$|Recently, we have {{presented}} a projected structured algorithm for solving constrained nonlinear least squares problems, and established its local two-step Q-superlinear convergence. The approach {{is based on}} an adaptive <b>structured</b> <b>scheme</b> due to Mahdavi-Amiri and Bartels of the exact penalty method. The structured adaptation also makes use of the ideas of Nocedal and Overton for handling the quasi-Newton updates of projected Hessians and appropriates the <b>structuring</b> <b>scheme</b> of Dennis, Martinez and Tapia. Here, for robustness, we present a specific nonsmooth line search strategy, taking account of the least squares objective. We also discuss the details of our new nonsmooth line search strategy, implementation details of the algorithm, and provide comparative results obtained by the testing of our program and three nonlinear programming codes from KNITRO on test problems (both small and large residuals) from Hock and Schittkowski, Lukšan and Vlček and some randomly generated ones due to Bartels and Mahdavi-Amiri.

40|$|Objectives The {{comparison}} of fourth hurdle processes is challenging {{because they are}} heterogeneous and decision practice may deviate from formal process rules. This study applies a published framework consisting of key steps of coverage decision processes {{to the area of}} cancer prevention. Methods A research design was developed for analysis of case studies on past decision processes. Decisions were identified and information on the process steps was elicited by semi-structured telephone interviews with decision-makers and experts. The scheme was validated with experts from the areas of screening and prevention and fourth hurdle decision making. Results Indicators for a structured empirical {{comparison of}} coverage decisions were derived. Corresponding ordinal rankings were proposed. Details on six decisions about cancer screening (colorectal and prostate cancer) and vaccination against human papillomavirus in Sweden, Austria and Lithuania are presented. Conclusions The development of the <b>structured</b> <b>scheme</b> for analysis of coverage decisions allows validation of official statements on decision processes and collection of larger data sets for empirical analysis. However, the semi-structured phone interviews were time-consuming for collecting information on a larger number of decisions. Further validation of the <b>structured</b> <b>scheme</b> and development of a research tool for large-scale empirical studies is still needed.
