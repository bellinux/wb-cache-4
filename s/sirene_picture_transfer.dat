Interconnectivity features in digital cameras allow more consumer-friendly usage of digital cameras. Moreover, with a suitable application layer software, digital photographs can be sent directly from the camera to a desired target: disk storage, printer, web site, as an e-mail message or web print, using a single, purpose-designed, communication protocol: the <b>Picture</b> <b>Transfer</b> Protocol, PTP. ...|$|R

50|$|The Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) is an {{extension}} to the <b>Picture</b> <b>Transfer</b> Protocol (PTP) communications protocol that allows media files to be transferred atomically to and from portable devices. Whereas PTP was designed for downloading photographs from digital cameras, Media Transfer Protocol allows the transfer of music files on digital audio players and media files on portable media players, as well as personal information on personal digital assistants.

50|$|This tongue TVSS {{system works}} by {{delivering}} electrotactile stimuli to the dorsum {{of the tongue}} via a flexible electrode array placed in the mouth. This electrode array is connected to a Tongue Display Unit TDU via a ribbon cable passing out of the mouth. A video camera records a <b>picture,</b> <b>transfers</b> it to the TDU for conversion into a tactile image. The tactile image is then projected onto the tongue via the ribbon cable where the tongue's receptors pick up the signal. After training, subjects are able to associate certain types of stimuli to certain types of visual images. In this way, tactile sensation {{can be used for}} visual perception.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Geotechnical {{centrifuges}} can {{simulate the}} behavior of soil material, with a high accuracy. One of the main aspects of centrifuge tests is sample monitoring during the test. <b>Picture</b> <b>transfer</b> is a useful way of gaining data from the sample. In this study, a vertical nailed slope was tested. Its side wall is meshed by target points and lines. The displacements of the points and deformation of the target lines are continually monitored. By triangulation of the points with an assumption of a linear displacement field, the magnitude of shear strain was calculated. Considering the peak points of strain curve in a longitudinal profile of the side wall, {{the position of the}} failure surface (zone) can be determined. Considering the deformation of line targets, the calculated surface is compared with reality. The results show good agreements. ...|$|R

50|$|The Scanner and Camera Wizard {{based on}} Windows Image Acquisition and other common dialogs for WIA devices have been {{improved}} in Windows XP {{to show the}} media information and metadata, rotate images as necessary, categorize them into subfolders, capture images and video {{in case of a}} still or video camera, crop and scan images to a single or multi-page TIFF in case of a scanner. The <b>Picture</b> <b>Transfer</b> Protocol (PTP) implementation has been updated to support all mandatory and optional commands in the PTP standard, and object tree support which allows secondary files associated with a parent file to be grouped and transferred concurrently. Windows Media Player 10 also adds the Media Transfer Protocol for transferring media content from portable devices. Thus, for digital cameras, Windows XP supports acquiring photos using any of either WIA, PTP, USB Mass Storage Class or MTP protocols depending on what the camera manufacturer supports.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a concept for {{the extension of}} CRMA [...] II (Cyclic Reservation Multiple Access) by a new service class. CRMA [...] II is a medium access protocol for slotted gigabit networks.
