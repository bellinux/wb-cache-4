50|$|An early myth about milk snakes is {{that they}} <b>suck</b> <b>cow</b> udders to get the milk. The myth is entirely false, and is discredited {{by the fact that}} the milk snake does not have the {{physical}} capabilities to suck milk out of a cow. Milk snakes are, however, frequently found in and around barns, making use of their cool and dark environments, and for the easily accessed populations of rodents to feed on. This proximity to barns, and therefore cows, probably gave rise to the myth.|$|R
40|$|Small {{numbers of}} Salmonella dublin {{were used to}} infect calves {{in an attempt to}} {{simulate}} natural infection on the farm. Twenty calves were exposed to S. dublin by {{one or more of the}} following methods: <b>Sucking</b> <b>cows</b> which were excreting S. dublin in their faeces (less than 10 (2) - 10 (5) organisms/g). Housing on S. dublin contaminated bedding. Drinking S. dublin contaminated water (10 (2) - 10 (4) organisms/ml). During this experiment some calves were given therapeutic does of oxytetracycline. After exposure the calves were examined for faecal excretion of S. dublin (in some instances mouth swabs and blood samples were also examined) and for clinical signs of illness. Most of the calves became infected with S. dublin but excretion was usually sporadic and the numbers of salmonellas excreted were small. No clinical signs of salmonellosis were observed by S. dublin was isolated from one calf at post-mortem. Another six calves, dosed orally with either 10 (6) or 10 (8) S. dublin, showed signs of mild illness and although three calves had diarrhoea excretion of salmonellas was intermittent. S. dublin was isolated from one of these calves at post-mortem...|$|R

40|$|Fourty-four Borana X Friesian F 1 {{crossbred}} calves born to Borana (Bos indicus) cows {{were randomly}} assigned to either suck their dams twice daily or bucket-feeding with 134 l. milk over a 57 -day pre-weaning period. Their dams were also allocated either to a supplement group with grass hay ad libitum and 5 kg per head per day of a concentrate ration or to an unsupplemented group with ad libitum grass hay only. Calves were fed in individual boxes in a calf house. The mean birth weight of calves was 24. 8 kg. Suckled calves were heavier at weaning and had faster pre-weaning growth rate than bucket-fed calves. Calves which <b>sucked</b> supplemented <b>cows</b> were heavier at weaning, had faster pre-weaning growth rate and higher daily milk intake than those which <b>sucked</b> unsupplemented <b>cows.</b> Mean concentrate intake was 302 g/day for bucket-fed calves and 341 and 408 g/day for calves which sucked supplemented and unsupplemented cows. Cow milk production was higher in suckled than in milked cows and in supplemented than unsupplemented cows. Concentrations of milk protein, fat and total solids averaged 39 and 143 g/kg, respectively and were not significantly influenced by either concentrate supplementation or suckling. Restricted suckling and early weaning coupled with appropriate calf and cow feeding regimes {{could be one of the}} alternatives for calf rearing under smallholder and smallscale peri-urban dairy production systems. However, further studies are warranted to evaluate the effects of such a strategy on both calf and cow performances under these production systems...|$|R
40|$|Background: Improvement {{of dairy}} farms {{economics}} requires intensification, automatic milking, and artificial rearing methods. The ability to express normal behavior {{is one of}} the five freedoms to achieve animal welfare, whereas the display of abnormal behaviors is considered as an indicator of poor welfare. Cross-sucking is defined as sucking any body parts of pen-mate calves, whereas inter-sucking in cows is defined as sucking the udder or udder area. Previous studies showed that self- and cross-sucking during the calf-hood period could be a causal factor of milk sucking in adulthood. Aim: To investigate the effects of cross-sucking among calves and inter-sucking in cows on animal health status and performance. Materials and Methods: Gathering information from customized questionnaires, the study of the breeding records, recording of self- and cross-sucking behaviors, and health status of calves till weaning, and dairy cows before milking were performed in two governmental farms under the same managemental conditions in Sohag and Qena governorates. Results: Cross-sucking appeared in calves at the 2 nd week of age followed by abscesses at ears and navels that were observed within cross-sucker calves. Milk sucking was higher in primiparous than multiparous cows during the second lactation period, as primiparous <b>cows</b> start to <b>suck</b> mostly around the 4 th month of milking. Mastitis and elongation of the front teats were observed in sucker cows. Suffered animals had body condition scoring 3. 5 or less. Interestingly, most of the cows displaying self-sucking were <b>sucking</b> another <b>cow</b> and were experienced self- or cross-sucking in their calf-hood. The use of pronged nose-rings was ineffective in preventing milk <b>sucking</b> and all <b>cows</b> were ultimately culled {{at the end of the}} season. Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate the health problems of abnormal oral behaviors in terms of developed ears and navels abscesses in cross-sucker calves, and mastitis and teat deformities in milk-sucker cows. Furthermore, indexes that lead to oral satisfaction should be taken in priorities of farm managers to effectively reduce or prevent crosssucking in calves. Culling of cows and heifers suffering from sucking would be the ultimate uneconomic alternative in case of persistent suckers...|$|R

40|$|The {{compromise}} enhancing {{effect of}} lobbying {{on public policy}} {{has been established in}} two typical settings. In the first, lobbies are assumed to act as 'principals' and the setters of the policy (the candidates in a Downsian electoral competition or the elected policy maker in a citizen- candidate model of electoral competition) are conceived as 'agents'. In the second setting, the proposed policies are solely determined by the lobbies who are assumed to take the dual role of 'principals' in one stage of the public-policy game and 'agents' in its second stage. The objective {{of this paper is to}} demonstrate that in the latter setting, the compromising effect of lobbying need not exist. Our reduced-form, two-stage public-policy contest, where two interest groups compete on the approval or rejection of the policy set by a politician, is sufficient to show that the proposed and possibly implemented policy can be more extreme and less efficient than the preferred policies of the interest groups. In such situations then more than the calf (interest groups) wish to <b>suck</b> the <b>cow</b> (politician) desires to suckle thereby threatening the public well being more than the lobbying interest groups. The main result specifies the conditions that give rise to such a situation under both the perfectly and imperfectly discriminating contests. public-policy contests, interest groups, policy makers, lobbying, compromise...|$|R

[...] Troll cats would then spit out the stolen milk into troughs next to the house. The Norwegian names trollnøste and trollnøa indicate their shapes: those troll cats looked like balls of yarn. Another type of troll cat had {{the shape of a}} regular cat; a difference between the two was that injury done to the cat-shaped troll cat would cause the same injury in the witch, whereas damaging the ball-shaped troll cat had no effect on her. [...] In addition, it was thought that shooting a troll cat would cause milk to spray from its wound. The troll cat is easily confused with the witch's hug, which could also assume the shape of a cat. The troll cat would have to be buried with the witch, or the witch would have to leave her grave to retrieve it.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was {{determined}} the effect of suckling of the calf restricted to once a day per 30 min plus a combined hormonal treatment on the postpartum anestrous period and fertility in beef cows after 120 days postpartum. About 67 Bos taurus x Bos indicus crossbred multiparous pregnant cows were used and randomly distributed to five treatments: traditional suckling (TS; n = 15), calf stayed all day with the dam; restricted suckling (RS; n = 14), calf <b>sucked</b> the <b>cow</b> once a day per 30 min beginning day 7 postpartum; TS plus a combined hormonal treatment (TSH; n = 15), applied at day 50 postpartum, consisting in GnRH+Norgestomet for 7 days+PGF 2 α (day 0) +GnRH (day 2); RS plus hormonal treatment (RSH; n = 16) as described in group 3 and without suckling (WS; n = 7) which included cows with death calves before day 7 postpartum. There was an increase (p≥ 0. 001) in the ovarian activity of cows in the RS and RSH treatment compared to TS and TSH group cows (78. 6 and 87. 5 vs. 26. 7 and 46. 7 %, respectively). Calving-first ovulation interval for WS cows was shorter (p≤ 0. 001) than intervals for RSH, RS, TSH and TS cows (22. 3 vs. 49. 3, 68. 8, 63. 5 and 86. 3 days, respectively). Likewise, the calving-first ovulation interval was shorter for RSH (p≤ 0. 01) vs. TSH and TS. Cows in RS and RSH treatments were more fertile (p≤ 0. 001) than those from TS and TSH groups (42. 3 and 56. 3 vs. 20. 0 and 6. 6 %, respectively). The WS cows (71. 4 %) had higher fertility (p≤ 0. 001) than cows from all other combined treatments (31. 6 %). No differences were found between treatments (p> 0. 05) regarding the incidence of corpora lutea of short half-life. In conclusion, suckling restricted to 30 min reduced the resumption period of ovarian activity in beef cows in the tropics of Mexico. Double dose of GnRH plus Norgestomet and PGF 2 α induced fertile ovulations after 50 days postpartum in restricted suckling cows...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{nutrition}} {{before and after}} calving on metabolic status and the resumption of ovulation postpartum was examined in multiparous <b>sucked</b> beef <b>cows</b> on subtropical pastures. At 6 – 7 months of gestation, Droughtmaster cows were randomly assigned on body weight (BW) and stage of gestation to two groups that received either standard subtropical pasture (SP, n = 7, 543 ± 12 kg BW) or improved pasture (IP, n = 7, 564 ± 12 kg BW). The two nutritional treatments were maintained after calving. Starting at 1 week after calving, cows were monitored for BW and body condition score (BCS, biweekly) and for circulating concentrations of insulin, glucose, IGF- 1, GH and leptin (weekly). Ovarian follicular status was monitored weekly by trans-rectal ultrasonography. Fecal samples were obtained at 3 -week intervals to ascertain percentage crude protein (%CP) and dry matter digestibility (DMD) of pastures. Crude protein and DMD were greater (P < 0. 05) for cows on IP during the first 9 weeks after calving after which {{there were no differences}} between nutritional treatments. Cows on IP were heavier (P < 0. 05) and had a greater (P < 0. 01) BCS than cows on SP at 1 week after calving (585 ± 9 kg and 3. 7 ± 0. 2 BCS and 528 ± 21 kg and 2. 3 ± 0. 2 BCS, respectively). Cows on SP showed a gradual increase in BW and there were no differences in BW after approximately 7 weeks postpartum whilst BCS remained less for cows on SP. Plasma concentrations of insulin, glucose, IGF- 1 and leptin were all greater (P < 0. 01) for cows on IP compared with cows on SP, whilst GH did not differ. The diameter of the largest follicle did not differ between cows on IP and SP throughout the postpartum period. However, 7 of 7 cows on IP resumed ovulations between 12 and 15 weeks postpartum whilst only 1 of 7 cows on SP had resumed ovulation during the study. It is concluded from the findings that exposure of cows to IP and SP before and after calving resulted in two groups of cows with different metabolic homeostasis and that the greater circulating concentrations of insulin, glucose, IGF- 1 and leptin promoted the earlier resumption of ovulation for cows on IP...|$|R
40|$|Summary:In {{the present}} work certain {{parameters}} of the lipid metabolism of the Southern elephant seal (Mirounga leonina) are investigated using biochemical and electrophoretical methods and electronmicroscopy. Further it will be discussed whether {{the results indicate that}} the lipid metabolism has been adapted specifically to the polar environment. Earlier investi-gations on Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) showed that in this species, choles-terol levels were comparatively high (400 - 1000 mg/dl), while levels of triacylglycerides were comparatively low (30 - 90 mg/dl), despite high dietary fat intake. However, no evi-dence of arteriosclerotic degeneration was detected in the arteries of Weddell seals and one elephant seal studied. In humans, however, a number of epidemiological studies have indi-cated a strong correlation between disorders in the lipid metabolism and coronary disease. Therefore, a number of laboratory methods have been established for routine and specia-lised diagnostics in human medicine. In the present study a number of these methods were used for investigations on Southern elephant seals and discussed. Field studies were carried out during two expeditions in 1995 / 96 and 1996 / 97 to the German-Argentinian Dallmann field laboratory on King George Island, Antarctica. For blood sampling, adult seals were either immobilised with ketamin or a ketamine/xylazine combination. Juvenile seals were not immobilised. Three different methods of drug ad-ministration were used, depending on field conditions. Three of 79 immobilisations were terminated using yohimbine. Laboratory analyses were carried out in the field laboratory, in the Klinikum Groß-hadern (LMU München), and in the Anatomische Anstalt, Lehrstuhl II (LMU München). In total, 182 blood samples were obtained from 40 seals, from 4 different animal groups: lactating <b>cows,</b> <b>sucking</b> pups, weaned pups, and adult seals during the annual moult. Each of the following parameters were analysed regularly in the 4 animal groups (value profiles) : 1) ultracentrifugation of blood serum to obtain lipoproteinfractions and determination of cholesterol concentration in each lipoprotein fraction 2) concentration in the blood serum of: esterified and non-esterified cholesterol, phospho-lipids, triacylglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids, b-hydroxybutyrate (b-HBA), blood glucose, and a-tocopherole 3) in each animal group and for each parameter the value profiles were calculated statis-tically using Kendall's coefficient of concordance. Value profiles with p 0. 05). In all animal groups, comparatively high levels of cholesterol and phospholipids were found. In all animal groups, an unknown tocopherol peak (called gML-peak) occurred in the HPLC, close to and of similar shape to the g-tocopherol peak as known in humans. It was noted that the diameters of some lipoprotein particles as found in the electron microscope photographs differ widely from those in humans. When ultracentrifugation is compared with the FPLC and the quantitative lipoprotein-electrophoresis, the HDL-cholesterol appears to be the predominant fraction. The HDL-binding SR-BI-receptor might {{play a central role in}} eliminating unnecessary cholesterol from the lipoprotein metabolism in order to avoid arteriosclerotic disease, as it has been found in mice. However, an high amount of disposable cholesterol might be necessary to ensure sufficient fluidity of cell membranes in blood vessels during deep diving. Chol-esterol might also be necessary as a source of precursors for aldosterone synthesis in order to save water during the lactation (and fasting) period in lactating cows. It is possible that the comparatively high levels of serum phospholipids are necessary for the synthesis of sufficient quantities of lung surfactant factor. In elephant seals, surfactant factor is assumed to be an essential substrate for the expansion of the lungs during the ascent from deep dives (over 1500 m). The particular aspects of lipid metabolism to be discussed are changes occuring as a result of changes in the nutritional status during the fasting periods in elephant seals. The value profiles of the investigated parameters indicate that the fasting periods of lactating cows, weaned pups, and moulting seals differ considerably from each other. Thus, it appears that there is a characteristic limit determining maximum fasting duration for each group. However, the minimum of fasting duration in each group is assumed to be a matter of behaviour and ontogenesis of elephant seals and of the development of weaned pups respectively. Because a lactating cow requires a minimum of 22 days to nurse the pup, she must remain in the breeding colony ashore. While undergoing the transition from sucking to nutritional independence, the weaned pup continues to develop body tissues, such as musculature, lungs and nervous system. The moulting seals probably do not fast per-manently. Their onshore period is supposed to be due to the reduced thermoregulatory capabilities during the moulting process when the blood circulation of the body surface and thus, the thermosteresis is increased. In summary, the lipid metabolism in all ages is directly and variously involved in the adaptation to the polar environment...|$|R
