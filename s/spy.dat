5|$|According to Oleg Gordievsky, {{the highest-ranking}} KGB officer ever to defect, and Pavel Sudoplatov, the former deputy {{director}} of Foreign Intelligence for the Soviet Union, Pontecorvo was a Soviet <b>spy.</b> However, Sudoplatov misidentified Pontecorvo as the <b>spy</b> codenamed Mlad, whom we now know was Ted Hall. While Pontecorvo always denied working on nuclear weapons, in Canada, Britain or the Soviet Union, he never confirmed or denied {{that he was a}} <b>spy.</b> The actual evidence against him was flimsy. Frank Close noted that the blueprints of the Canadian NRX reactor had {{made their way to the}} Soviet Union, and Lona Cohen obtained a sample of uranium from the NRX after it started operation in 1947. Nunn May could not have been the culprit, so Pontecorvo is the prime suspect.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRevolutionaries and <b>Spies</b> is a game, G(G,r,s,k), {{played on}} a graph G between two teams: one team {{consists}} of r revolutionaries, the other consists of s <b>spies.</b> To start, each revolutionary chooses a vertex as its position. The <b>spies</b> then do the same. (Throughout the game, there is no restriction {{on the number of}} revolutionaries and <b>spies</b> that may be positioned on any given vertex.) The revolutionaries and <b>spies</b> then alternate moves with the revolutionaries going first.

The goal of the revolutionaries is to place k of their team on some vertex v {{in such a way that}} the <b>spies</b> cannot place one of their <b>spies</b> at v in their next move; this is a win for the revolutionaries.
