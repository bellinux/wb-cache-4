40|$|Marshall, 1922 (Coleoptera, Curculionidae) is a pest associ-ated with papaya {{crops in}} the north and {{northeast}} regions of Brazil (Moreira et al. 2003). Females of the papaya borer weevil lay their eggs on the papaya trunk into which larvae penetrate after egg hatching causing destruction of meristem-atic tissues, affecting <b>sap</b> <b>translocation</b> and eventually kill-ing the plant (Farias & Almeida 1995). The larval cycle of the papaya borer weevil takes approximately three months, however we are not aware of any study on the biological as-pects of this pest. Since the larvae dwell inside the trunk the use of pesticides is largely inefficient. The use of natural enemies such as parasitoids to control insect pests is an im-portant strategy in integrated pest management program...|$|E
40|$|Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) {{enhanced}} the exudation of 14 C-labeled assimilates from excised leaflets and whole plant specimens of Fraxinus uhdei Wenz. A 2 millimolar EDTA concentration {{was found to}} be most effective in promoting exudation from excised leaflets, while 10 millimolar EDTA was most effective in whole plants experiments. Exudation rate reached a maximum after 24 hours in both experiments. The continuous presence of EDTA throughout the treatment period was required for maximum exudation from excised leaflets. Stachyose, raffinose, verbascose, and sucrose were the principal compounds found to occur in exudate samples. These compounds are typically transported in sieve elements of various Fraxinus species suggesting the exudate was of phloem origin. Electron microscope studies of petiolule sieve plate pores from excised leaflets showed substantially less callose appearing after treatment with EDTA than after H 2 O treatment. It is suggested that EDTA enhances phloem exudation by inhibiting or reducing callose formation in sieve plate pores. The exudation enhancement technique described for whole plant specimens is suggested as a useful means of collecting phloem <b>sap</b> and studying <b>translocation</b> in woody plants...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSoil {{salinity}} is {{an increasing}} menace that affects agriculture across the globe. Plant adaptation to high salt concentrations involves integrated functions, including control of Na+ uptake, translocation and compartmentalization. Na+ transporters belonging to the HKT family {{have been shown to}} be involved in tolerance to mild salt stress in glycophytes such as Arabidopsis, wheat and rice by contributing to Na+ exclusion from aerial tissues. Here, we have analysed the role of the HKT transporter HKT 2; 1, which is permeable to K+ and Na+, in barley, a relatively salt-tolerant crop that displays a salt-including behaviour. In Xenopus oocytes, HvHKT 2; 1 co-transports Na+ and K+ over a large range of concentrations, displaying low affinity for Na+, variable affinity for K+ depending on external Na+ concentration, and inhibition by K+ (K(i) approximately 5 mm). HvHKT 2; 1 is predominantly expressed in the root cortex. Transcript levels are up-regulated in both roots and shoots by low K+ growth conditions, and in shoots by high Na+ growth conditions. Over-expression of HvHKT 2; 1 led to enhanced Na+ uptake, higher Na+ concentrations in the xylem <b>sap,</b> and enhanced <b>translocation</b> of Na+ to leaves when plants were grown in the presence of 50 or 100 mm NaCl. Interestingly, these responses were correlated with increased barley salt tolerance. This suggests that one of the factors that limits barley salt tolerance is the capacity to translocate Na+ to the shoot rather than accumulation or compartmentalization of this cation in leaf tissues. Thus, over-expression of HvHKT 2; 1 leads to increased salt tolerance by reinforcing the salt-including behaviour of barley...|$|R
