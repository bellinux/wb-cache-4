40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} modelling and {{simulation of}} an underwater vehicle {{equipped with a}} collective and cyclic propeller (CCPP). A CCPP has been applied in helicopters and it generates both axial and <b>side</b> <b>thrusts</b> that move a helicopter in all directions. If axial and <b>side</b> <b>thrusts</b> of the CCPP are controlled as desired {{it is possible to}} apply the CCPP to an underwater vehicle. A new CCPP has been designed and fabricated for a torpedo shaped underwater vehicle. Captive experiments were conducted to quantify the performance of the CCPP. The paper reports recent development of an underwater vehicle equipped with the CCPP including design and fabrication of the experimental facility, conduct of experiments, modeling, performance of the CCPP and simulation of the vehicle propelled by the CCPP...|$|R

60|$|Lingard and {{the young}} leader of the Wajo traders met in the splendid light of noonday, and amidst the {{attentive}} silence of their followers, on the very spot where the Malay seaman had lost his life. Lingard, striding up from one <b>side,</b> <b>thrust</b> out his open palm; Hassim responded at once to the frank gesture and they exchanged their first hand-clasp over the prostrate body, as if fate had already exacted {{the price of a}} death for the most ominous of her gifts--the gift of friendship that sometimes contains the whole good or evil of a life.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{portion of}} the total power loss in a modern automotive engine is due to piston ring/cylinder bore friction. This paper introduces the results of simulations about the interaction of a SI engine piston ring {{taking into account the}} mixed lubrication regime, the ring flexibility in presence of piston approaching motion to the cylinder liner. The friction force calculations show a visible difference between the ring portion interacting with the two cylinder <b>sides</b> (<b>Thrust</b> and Anti-Thrust) due to specific oil film wedges caused by flexibility and piston lateral motion. The effects of engine speed, radial tension, surface roughness and ring shape are also investigable...|$|R

50|$|Piston skirt durability: The piston {{must also}} contact {{the wall for}} cooling {{purposes}} but also must transfer the <b>side</b> <b>thrust</b> of the power stroke.

50|$|A tandem attack {{where two}} wrestlers {{stand in front}} of an {{opponent}} and hit him/her in the face/head with a high, <b>side</b> <b>thrust</b> kick, known as a superkick.

60|$|A {{young man}} seated by the {{struggling}} sinner {{held her hand}} and fanned her with his hat, while some girl friends, scared and sobbing, kept the tossing limbs covered.

60|$|This {{time there}} was no escape. Toueno had been asleep, and only opened his eyes as they entered.

60|$|They went {{together}} through the gorgeous unnatural beauty of cactus and azalea and found Leonard Quinton, poet and romancer, {{with his head}} hanging downward off his ottoman and his red curls sweeping the ground.

50|$|Further {{issues are}} the {{foundations}} for the bridge. Arch bridges generate large side thrusts on their footings and so may require a solid bedrock foundation. Flattening the arch shape to avoid the humpback problem, such as for Brunel's Maidenhead bridge, increases this <b>side</b> <b>thrust.</b> It is often impossible to achieve a flat enough arch, simply owing to {{the limitations of the}} foundations - particularly in flat country. Historically, such bridges often became viaducts of multiple small arches.|$|E

Some also have a gauge wheel to regulate maximum depth.3.Semi-mounted - used principally for larger plows. These have a rear wheel which usually carries weight and <b>side</b> <b>thrust</b> when plowing and sometimes {{the weight of the}} rear end of the plow when lifted. The front end of the plow is carried on the tractor lower or draft links.|$|E
50|$|At {{the north}} end of Eschbach stands a group of cliffs up to 12 m high and made of quartz. The cliff wall is the visible part of a roughly six-kilometre-long quartz seam which {{continues}} slantwise across the Usa Valley to the Wormstein in Usingen town forest. From a geological standpoint, it is an oblique upthrow (fault with one <b>side</b> <b>thrust</b> up higher than the other) formed by faulting in the mountain range. The erosion-resistant quartz has lasted to this day and can be seen in many places in the Taunus, but nowhere is it more spectacular than here.|$|E
40|$|Attitude {{control of}} a {{prototype}} satellite bus using fluid mechanical vectoring on an aerospike nozzle is demonstrated. The design achieves thrust vectoring by injecting pro- pellant asymmetrically into the unconstrained aerospike exhaust plume near the nozzle base. The prototype system uses cold-gas thrusters to both spin-up and de-tumble the test article. The system is configured with axially directed annular flows that produce large lon- gitudinal thrusts and smaller secondary lateral-injection flows for <b>side</b> <b>thrusts.</b> Both open and closed-loop attitude control, with and without main aerospike annular flow active, are demonstrated. Proportional, integral, derivative (PID) regulation is used for closed-loop attitude control. When the vectoring ports are operated with no primary plenum flow, very small impulse bits are generated. Based on the results presented in this paper, there exists a significant potential for three-degree of freedom (3 -DOF) attitude control without mechan- ical nozzle gimbals. When extended to 3 -DOF, the closed-loop control-law will allow the primary satellite propulsion system {{to be used for}} both larger-scale orbit change maneuvers and smaller-scale proximity operation maneuvers with the same system...|$|R
40|$|The design, {{operating}} features, and {{a possible}} Neptune orbit for the spacecraft powered by the SP- 100 nuclear electric propulsion (NEP) system under study by NASA and the DOE are described. The system features a reactor and a payload situated on opposite ends of a 0. 5 m diam, 11 m long astromast. Mercury-ion thrusters are located beneath the reactor for <b>side</b> <b>thrusting,</b> and no contamination of the payload or obstruction of the viewing angles for scientific objectives occurs with the system, which would not degrade in performance even under high insolation during near-sun maneuvers. Results of a theoretical study of earth escapes are presented to show that an NEP powered spiral trajectory out of a 700 km Shuttle orbit and using a Triton gravity assist would be superior to departing from a 300 km orbit with a Centaur boost. The mission profile includes a 1249 kg Galileo payload. The SP- 100 has a 1. 4 MWth reactor with UO 2 fuel tiles and weighs 19, 904 kg...|$|R
3000|$|The Naryn basin, {{another major}} intermontane basin within the Tien Shan ranges, is located {{east of the}} study area. Like the Fergana basin, it is bounded on both <b>sides</b> by {{symmetric}} <b>thrust</b> zones with basinward vergences.|$|R
50|$|The {{effect is}} to prevent the {{exchange}} of oil from any two adjacent chambers located {{on either side of}} a given sealing area and the oil can only be interchanged by the actual rotation of the rotor and vanes. This is the pumping mechanism for the historical vane pump or motor. The term 'pressure balanced' {{comes from the fact that}} pressure in any chamber is matched by the same pressure in the diametrically opposite chamber and the hydraulic radial <b>side</b> <b>thrust</b> calculated by a 'side view area' and the two forces are opposite and cancel; hence the name'pressure balanced'.|$|E
50|$|In marine propulsion, the {{efficiency}} of a propeller or thruster can be severely curtailed by the Coandă effect. The force on the vessel generated by a propeller {{is a function of}} the speed, volume and direction ofthe water jet leaving the propeller. Under certain conditions (e.g., when a ship moves through water) the Coandă effect changes the direction of a propeller jet, causing it to follow the shape of the ship's hull. The side force from a tunnel thruster at the bow of a ship decreases rapidly with forward speed. The <b>side</b> <b>thrust</b> may completely disappear at speeds above about 3 knots.If the Coandă effect is applied to symmetrically shaped nozzles, it presents resonation problems. Those problems and how different spins couple has been analyzed in depth by Shyam, Pascoa et al.|$|E
50|$|This {{re-entry}} vehicle is {{unlike that of}} the Shaheen I in that it has four moving delta control fins at the rear and small solid/liquid-propellant <b>side</b> <b>thrust</b> motors, which are used to orient the {{re-entry vehicle}} after the booster stage is depleted or before re-entry to improve accuracy by providing stabilization during the terminal phase. This {{can also be used}} to fly evasive manoeuvres, making it problematic for existing anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems to successfully intercept the missile. The Shaheen II warhead may change its trajectory several times during re-entry and during the terminal phase, effectively preventing ABM radar systems from pre-calculating intercept points. The re-entry vehicle is also stated to utilise a GPS satellite guidance system to provide updates on its position, further improving its accuracy and reducing the CEP.|$|E

60|$|She was not {{far ahead}} of them, with jib thrashed to ribands and the sea {{streaming}} from her swung-up <b>side.</b> Jimmy <b>thrust</b> down his telegraph and shouted to Lindstrom, who dropped from the bridge as they drove past her stern. Then, as he raised his hand, the man behind him gasped as he struggled with his wheel, and the Shasta, stopping, lay rolling wildly beneath the schooner's lee, while a shadowy figure gesticulated to those on board her from her spray-swept rail. Jimmy glanced shoreward over his shoulder toward the tumbling surf, and decided that he had at most five minutes to take that man off. After that {{it would probably be}} too late for all of them.|$|R
50|$|The {{class were}} {{widely used in}} Devon and Cornwall where the track had many sharp curves. It was found that flange wear on the leading driving wheels became {{excessive}} {{as a result of}} these bends. In November and December 1927 additional weight was added to the front end of four examples so that the pony truck would be forced to impart more <b>side</b> <b>thrust</b> to the main frames on bends. These locomotives reverted to their original state, but between January and March 1928, 65 engines of 5300 series received additional weight on the pony truck, and 3000 was added to their running numbers, temporarily creating an ‘8300 Class’. However, the additional weight placed them in the Red category of route availability. From 1944 onwards there was a shortage of locomotives in the Blue category and so the additional weights were removed and the surviving locomotives resumed their original running numbers. The last to be returned to its original condition was 8393 in September 1948.|$|E
