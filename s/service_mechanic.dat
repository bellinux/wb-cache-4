40|$|Because {{customers}} ’ {{assessment of}} services {{is based on}} performances rather than objects, they rely on the numerous clues that are embedded in performance when choosing services and evaluating service experi-ences. Indeed, it is often small clues that influence a customer’s overall perception of an experience. Customers form perceptions based on the technical performance of the service (functional clues), the tangibles associated with the <b>service</b> (<b>mechanic</b> clues), and the behavior and appearance of service providers (humanic clues). Functional, mechanic, and humanic clues play specific roles in creating the customer’s service experience, influencing both rational and emotional perceptions of service quality. Clearly and consistently designing and orchestrating clues is a critical management responsibility; busi-nesses need to be “clue conscious ” and add “clue management ” to their job descriptions...|$|E
40|$|With {{tension between}} the demand for health {{services}} {{and the cost of}} providing them, rationing is increasingly evident in all medical systems. Until recently, rationing was primarily through the ability to pay or achieved implicitly by doctors working within fixed budgets. Such forms of rationing are commonly alleged to be inequitable and inefficient and explicit rationing is advocated as more appropriate. Utilisation management in the United States and quasi-markets separating purchasing from provision in the United Kingdom are seen as ways of using resources more efficiently and are increasingly explicit. There is also advocacy to ration explicitly at the point of <b>service.</b> <b>Mechanic</b> reviews the implications of these developments and explains why explicit approaches are likely to focus conflict and dissatisfaction and be politically unstable. Explicit rationing is unlikely to be as equitable as its proponents argue and is likely to make dissatisfaction and perceived deprivation more salient. Despite its limitations, implicit rationing at the point of service is more sensitive to the complexity of medical decisions and the needs and personal and cultural preferences of patients. All systems use a mix of rationing devices, but the clinical allocation of services should substantially depend on the discretion of professionals informed by practice guidelines, outcomes research, and other informational aids...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the steps}} in the {{production}} of diodes involves applying a protective tin/lead layer. In order {{to improve the quality of}} this process step at the plant of Philips Semiconductors Stadskanaal, a so-called Process Action Team (PAT) was instituted. This team, consisting of operators, a quality engineer, a <b>service</b> <b>mechanic,</b> a manager, and a statistician, worked to-gether with the common objective to improve the quality of the tin-lead layers of the diodes. In this report I discuss some of the problems we had to beat when I had the opportunity to provide statistical assistance to this PAT. The tin/lead layer is applied in a chemical bath that needs adjustments from time to time. A Linear Programming model was devel-oped to compute optimal adjustments. The remainder of the report deals with the subject when and how to adjust the bath, based on production data. Since these data appeared to be serially correlated, some form of regulation was needed in order to meet specications. However, it turned out that the process was overregulated. It is discussed how we moved from overregulation (tampering with the process) to a process that is controlled by a sensible combination of regulation and SPC techniques. Due to the presence of serial correlation, it was not possible to apply the standard control chart techniques. We discuss what modications were needed in order to be able to monitor correlated process data...|$|E

2500|$|The United States {{recognized}} that French skilled labor was severely limited by war casualties, {{and promised to}} train and deploy 7,000 automobile mechanics to aid the French Motor Transport Corps. In December 1917 the Aviation Section developed a maintenance organization of four large units termed Motor Mechanics Regiments, Signal Corps, each regiment consisting of four battalions of five companies totaling more than 3,600 men. The key innovative element {{was the use of}} junior officers recruited from the automobile industry as [...] "technical officers" [...] to supervise maintenance. In February 1918, Colonel S.D. Waldon of the Signal Corps returned from observing British factory and field methods in aviation operations, just as the Bureau of Aircraft Production concluded that the French were unable to meet their aircraft production goals. Waldon recommended that the regiments be reorganized for aircraft instead of automobile mechanics. The change came too late to affect the 1st and 2nd Regiments, which landed in France in March 1918, but both the 3rd and 4th Regiments reorganized, delaying their deployment until the end of July. [...] By the Armistice all four regiments were configured as aircraft repair and maintenance units, and designated Air <b>Service</b> <b>Mechanics</b> Regiments.|$|R
