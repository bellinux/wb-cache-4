5|$|In European Salamandridae, {{albinism}} {{has been}} recorded in the fire <b>salamander</b> (Salamandra salamandra), gold-striped <b>salamander</b> (Chioglossa lusitanica), Italian crested newt (Triturus carnifex), marbled newt (Triturus marmoratus), Iberian ribbed newt (Pleurodeles waltl), alpine newt (Ichthyosaura alpestris) and two sub-species of the smooth newt (Lissotriton vulgaris vulgaris and Lissotriton vulgaris meridionalis).|$|E
5|$|The Pine Bush is {{also home}} to 30 of the 44 species of {{amphibians}} and reptiles that are indigenous to Albany County. Seven of these species are generally not seen so far north in the state of New York. Three species of <b>salamander,</b> the Jefferson <b>salamander</b> (Ambystoma jeffersonium), blue-spotted <b>salamander</b> (Ambystoma laterale), and spotted <b>salamander</b> (Ambystoma maculatum), are state-listed special concern animals. Two species of turtle, the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata) and wood turtle (Clemmys insculpta), are also special concern animals. About 45 species of birds breed in the Albany Pine Bush (according to the 1985 New York State Breeding Bird Atlas) and are fairly common species for the area. About 32 species of common small mammals have been found in and adjacent to the Pine Bush.|$|E
5|$|Lungless {{salamanders}} in {{the family}} Plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay {{a small number of}} unpigmented eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter. Each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg, emerging fully formed as a juvenile <b>salamander.</b> The female <b>salamander</b> often broods the eggs. In the genus Ensatinas, the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them, effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion.|$|E

50|$|Thorius, {{also known}} as minute <b>salamanders,</b> pigmy <b>salamanders,</b> or Mexican pigmy <b>salamanders,</b> is a genus of <b>salamanders</b> in the family Plethodontidae. They are endemic to Mexico and found in {{southern}} Veracruz and Puebla to Guerrero and Oaxaca.|$|R
5|$|Predators {{may include}} beetles and sciomyzid fly larvae, {{many of which}} {{specialize}} in feeding upon snails. Other potential predators may include the northern two-lined <b>salamander</b> (Eurycea bislineata), northern dusky <b>salamander</b> (Desmognathus fuscus), and Allegheny Mountain dusky <b>salamander</b> (Desmognathus ochrophaeus), which are common in the talus and on the ledges, as well as various small mammals or passerine birds such as robins and pigeons, which are often seen {{in or near the}} habitat. Although predation {{does not appear to be}} a limiting factor at this time, its potential impact on a low or stressed population is unclear. The 1978 listing rule included predation by the introduced European snails, Discus rotundatus and Oxychilus spp. as serious threats to Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. Little is currently known about this relationship.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} long-toed <b>salamander</b> is dusky {{black with}} a dorsal stripe of tan, yellow, or olive-green. This stripe can also be broken up {{into a series of}} spots. The sides of the body can have fine white or pale blue flecks. The belly is dark-brown or sooty in color with white flecks. Root tubercles are present, but they are not quite as {{developed}} as other species, such as the tiger <b>salamander.</b>|$|E
5|$|The calls made by caecilians and {{salamanders}} {{are limited}} to occasional soft squeaks, grunts or hisses and have not been much studied. A clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be a means of orientation, as in bats, or a form of communication. Most salamanders are considered voiceless, but the California giant <b>salamander</b> (Dicamptodon ensatus) has vocal cords and can produce a rattling or barking sound. Some species of <b>salamander</b> emit a quiet squeak or yelp if attacked.|$|E
40|$|<b>Salamanders</b> (Ambystoma tigrinumare) are smooth-skinned {{amphibians}} with no skin covering such as scales, hair, or feathers. There {{are several}} dozen kinds of <b>salamanders</b> {{found in the}} United States, but most occur only in parts of one or several states. <b>Salamanders</b> depend on water and moisture for their existence. All <b>salamanders</b> are predators. <b>Salamanders</b> generally are active {{when there is no}} sunshine—at night or on cloudy, rainy days. <b>Salamanders</b> do not cause damage to people or property...|$|R

5|$|Twenty-six {{amphibian}} {{species are}} found in Michigan, one of the fifty United States. These species include twelve species of frog, twelve species of <b>salamander</b> and two species of toad, {{all members of the}} class Amphibia. Blanchard's cricket frog, a subspecies of northern cricket frog, is considered to be threatened and two species, the marbled <b>salamander</b> and small-mouth <b>salamander,</b> are considered endangered; these are protected under the Endangered Species Act of the State of Michigan. Two more species, the boreal chorus frog and lesser siren, are considered to be of special concern, although they are not protected under the act.

5|$|The time of {{breeding}} {{depends on the}} elevation and latitude of the <b>salamander's</b> habitat. Generally, the lower-elevation <b>salamanders</b> breed in the fall, winter, and early spring. Higher-elevation <b>salamanders</b> breed in spring and early summer. In the higher climates especially, <b>salamanders</b> will enter ponds and lakes that still have ice floating.|$|R
50|$|The Cryptobranchoidea are a {{suborder}} of <b>salamanders</b> {{found in}} the eastern United States, China, Taiwan, and Japan. They are known as primitive <b>salamanders,</b> in contrast to Salamandroidea, or advanced <b>salamanders.</b>|$|R
5|$|Many {{woodland}} salamanders lay {{clutches of}} eggs under dead logs or stones on land. The black mountain <b>salamander</b> (Desmognathus welteri) does this, the mother brooding {{the eggs and}} guarding them from predation as the embryos feed on the yolks of their eggs. When fully developed, they break {{their way out of}} the egg capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders. The male hellbender, a primitive <b>salamander,</b> excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there. The male then guards the site for the two or three months before the eggs hatch, using body undulations to fan the eggs and increase their supply of oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Reptiles and {{amphibians}} {{can also}} be found in the parks, with the northwestern ringneck snake, northern red-legged frog, Pacific giant <b>salamander,</b> and the rough-skinned newt most commonly seen.|$|E
5|$|The few {{amphibians}} {{present in}} the forest include the Rocky Mountain tailed frog, long-toed <b>salamander,</b> and Columbia spotted frog, which has been listed as a sensitive species. Common snakes include bullsnakes, garter snakes, and rubber boas.|$|E
50|$|Adults {{spend most}} of their time in their burrows or under logs, as is the case with most mole <b>salamanders.</b> Juvenile marbled <b>salamanders</b> hatch early {{compared}} to most <b>salamanders</b> and gain a size advantage by feeding and growing for several months before the Jefferson <b>salamanders</b> and spotted <b>salamanders</b> hatch later in the spring. Larvae typically mature as quickly as two months in the southern part of their range, but take up to six months to mature in the northern part.Marbled <b>salamanders,</b> like other members of this genus, are reported to have relatively long life spans, 8-10 years or more.|$|R

40|$|Intensively-managed forest (IMF) {{ecosystems}} support environmental processes, retain {{biodiversity and}} reduce pressure to extract wood products from other forests, but may affect species, such as plethodontid <b>salamanders,</b> {{that are associated}} with closed canopies and possess limited vagility. We describe: (1) critical aspects of IMF ecosystems; (2) effectiveness of plethodontid <b>salamanders</b> as barometers of forest change; (3) two case studies of relationships between <b>salamanders</b> and coarse woody debris (CWD); and (4) research needs for effective management of <b>salamanders</b> in IMF ecosystems. Although plethodontid <b>salamanders</b> are sensitive to microclimate changes, their role as ecological indicators rarely have been evaluated quantitatively. Our case studies of CWD and <b>salamanders</b> in western and eastern forests demonstrated effects of species, region and spatial scale on the existence and strength of relationships between plethodontid species and a “critical” microhabitat variable. Oregon slender <b>salamanders</b> (Batrachoseps wrighti) were more strongly associated with abundance of CWD in managed second growth forests than ensatina <b>salamanders</b> (Ensatina eschscholtzii). Similarly, CWD was not an important predictor of abundance of Appalachian <b>salamanders</b> in managed hardwood forest. Gaining knowledge of <b>salamanders</b> in IMF ecosystems is critical to reconciling ecological and economic objectives of intensive forest management, but faces challenges in design and implementation...|$|R
5|$|The {{suborder}} Cryptobranchoidea {{contains the}} primitive salamanders. A number of fossil cryptobranchids have been found, {{but there are}} only three living species, the Chinese giant <b>salamander</b> (Andrias davidianus), the Japanese giant <b>salamander</b> (Andrias japonicus) and the hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis) from North America. These large amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult state; gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded. A unique feature is their ability to feed by suction, depressing either the left side of their lower jaw or the right. The males excavate nests, persuade females to lay their egg strings inside them, and guard them. As well as breathing with lungs, they respire through the many folds in their thin skin, which has capillaries close to the surface.|$|E
5|$|Acarine parasites {{include the}} Glycyphagidae (Glycyphagus hypudaei and Orycteroxenus soricis); the Laelapidae (Androlaelaps fahrenholzi, Echinonyssus obsoletus, Haemogamasus occidentalis and Haemogamasus reidi); the Listrophoridae (Listrophorus mexicanus); the Myobiidae (Amorphacarus hengererorum, Amorphacarus soricis, Protomyobia atophyracis and Protomyobia brevisetosa), and the Pygmephoridae (Pygmephorus horridus and Pygmephorus whitakeri).

5000|$|Bolitoglossa is a genus of lungless <b>salamanders,</b> {{also called}} mushroom-tongued <b>salamanders</b> {{tropical}} climbing <b>salamanders</b> or web-footed <b>salamanders,</b> {{in the family}} Plethodontidae. Their range is between northern Mexico through Central America to Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, northeastern Brazil, and central Bolivia. Neotropical <b>salamanders</b> of the Bolitoglossa genus make up the largest genus in the order Caudata, consisting of approximately one-fifth of all known species of <b>salamanders.</b> [...] Adult <b>salamanders</b> range anywhere from 45mm to 200mm in length depending on their specific species. They are notorious {{for their ability to}} project their tongue at prey items, as indicated from their name. They are also known for their webbed feet, having significantly more webbing than any other species outside their genus {{with the exception of the}} cave-dwelling Mexican bolitoglossine Chiropterotriton magnipes. Although webbed feet are a common characteristic of these <b>salamanders,</b> only about half of the species in this genus contain webbed feet.|$|R

5|$|Due to the {{possibility}} of respiration across the skin combined with small size, all known lungless tetrapods are amphibians. The majority of <b>salamander</b> species are lungless salamanders, which respirate through their skin and tissues lining their mouth. This necessarily restrict their size: all are small and rather thread-like in appearance, maximising skin surface relative to body volume. Other known lungless tetrapods are the Bornean flat-headed frog and Atretochoana eiselti, a caecilian.|$|E
