Because resistance varies from one individual to another, the [...] "lethal dose" [...] represents a dose (usually recorded as dose per kilogram of subject body weight) at which a given percentage of subjects will die.

Although functionality will remain an es-sential precondition for user satisfaction with products and market success, emo-tional experiences influence how a product is received. A product that the user does not wish to interact with will not be considered as meaningful for that person, and such a product will elicit negative emotions, perhaps expressed as unpleasant feelings. Using Emotional Universal Design (EUD) Principles as complements to the seven original Universal Design (UD) Principles is one way to initiate a dis-cussion about how socio-cultural obstacles can also be reduced or even eliminated in society...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT For the {{description}} of the thermal bioclimatic factors the parameters Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET) are well suitable. With the software RayMan we, for the first time, computed daily values for PMV and PET {{on the basis of the}} 8 or 24 per day synoptic observations at eight Argentine stations of La Quiaca (24 ° S) to Ushuaia (55 ° S) for 12 h, 15 h and 18 h local time for the period 1. 1. 1996 to 31. 12. 2005. To ensure comparability the calculations refer to a <b>standard</b> <b>person</b> with given clothing and activity. The investigated bioclimate conditions of a ten year period of PMV and PET for the summer months (December to February) show the variability of thermal comfort conditions at eight locations from north (La Quiaca) to south (Ushuaia) of Argentina. In the histograms, the frequency with which threshold values of PET were exceeded are shown. Clear differences between the locations in terms of bioclimate are also visible. The latter are of particular relevance for {{the description}} of climate for tourism as well as other recreational outdoor activities in Argentina...|$|E

40|$|The {{village of}} Vinaninkarena, Antsirabe, Madagascar (47 ° 02 ’ 40 ’’E, 19 ° 57 ’ 17 ’’S) {{is located in}} a high {{radioactivity}} area. With the aim of assessing the health impact of radioactivity pollution, a survey was conducted around an abandoned radium mining. Waters from 24 sampling points, including 5 wells and 13 springs were sampled. The water radioactivity was measured using a portable Triathler LSC, model 425 - 034 from Hidex Turku. Each sample is counted more than 3 times: less than 2 h after sampling, 4 h to few days and more than 3 weeks after when 226 Ra attains equilibrium with 222 Rn and its short-lived daughters. Combination of water non miscible, radon extractive LS cocktail and water miscible one is used to reveal contribution of radium, radon and its short lived progenies to the gross alpha-beta activities. Maximum activity values found are: 3. 6 ± 0. 3 Bq. L- 1 for 226 Ra, 554 ± 9 Bq. L- 1 for the excess of radon, and 408 ± 8 Bq. L- 1 for the excess of radon progenies. Based on these data, a daily consumption of 2 L of these waters by a <b>standard</b> <b>person</b> would produce an annual 226 Ra ingestion well above the annual intake limit for 226 Ra. Moreover, the increasing gross alpha-beta activity resulting from radon progenies raises the issue of health effects. The potential for rapid spring-to-mouth delivery, which is frequent in rural area, may expose the water consumer to the short-lived alpha particle emitters. 1...|$|E
40|$|At the MPI for Psycholinguistics we {{launched}} a new web site (www. mpi. nl) on April 20, 2009. The web site is created in the Content Management System Plone. Our Plone CMS communicates with three data bases: 1. The MPI people data base: The interaction between the data base and the CMS is through a python script which allows us to create <b>standard</b> <b>person</b> pages for each MPI member. Person pages have a default person home set-up, a standard sub folder structure and some extra functionality to create user specific content. 2. The MPDL PubMan data base. Every night our CMS retrieves the metadata from the PubMan data base and stores these in the CMS using a python script. Researchers can specify a set of criteria to select the publications they wish to show on the publication folder of their person pages. The display can either be set to sort the publications by year, or by publication type {{or a combination of}} the two. A special (and hidden) 'local tag' element in the PubMan metadata set has been created to either create a collection for special publications or to exclude publications to be presented on the web page. In addition, research group and projects can create publications list based on the research group or project name. The MPDL metadata accomodates persistent links to the full text which can be viewed directly from the website when set at Public (in PubMan). In case the publication is set at Private a request form will appear with which users can send a request to our Library. The MPDL metadata also accomdates persistent links to the MPI-psycholinguistics research data archive. This allows the users to store supplementary material (primary data) in this archive and to link it to the PubMan data base. On the web site it will show automatically if the publiaction has supplementary material. 3. The MPI research data archive At our institute we house a primary research data archive. From the web site links can be created to these data, which will provide an alternative (and more public friendly) manner of showing the data. To realize the communication between the CMS and the three data bases has been quite a technical and organisational challenge, involving a lot of commitment from the MPDL team members and from the institute staff involved {{in the development of the}} web site (library, techical support). We feel that the functionality we have created is complex, but very nice and -easy-to-be-used- by other MPI institutes with a Plone based web site...|$|E

40|$|Research was {{conducted}} to determine {{the degree to which}} the effect of obesity on blood pressure was modified by sociocultural factors A measure of psychosocial resources incorporating both access to social supports and coping styles, was developed in research in St. Lucia, a West Indian culture. The study sample consisted of 98 40 - 49 -year olds randomly selected from a community. Obesity was measured by percent overweight using weight-for-height <b>standards.</b> <b>Persons</b> with lower psychosocial resources had higher blood pressures; overweight persons had higher blood pressures. Those persons greater than 10 % overweight with low psychosocial resources had significantly higher blood pressures (p < 0. 05). Further analysis indicated that the direct effect of psychosocial resources was due primarily to the effect of social supports, while the interaction effect was due primarily to the effect of coping styles. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that specific sociocultural factors provide a protective function with respect to disease through some as yet unspecified physiologic mechanism...|$|R
