60|$|The valley-sole is parti-coloured; {{the sands}} of the deeper line to the right are tinctured a pale and sickly green by the {{degradation}} of the porphyritic traps, here towering in the largest masses yet seen; while the gravel of the left bank is warm, and lively with red grit and <b>syenitic</b> granite. Looking down the long and gently waving line, we feel still connected with the civilized world by the blue and purple screen of Sinai forming the splendid back-ground. Everything around us appears deserted; the Ma'ázah are up country, and the Beni Ukbah have temporarily quitted these grazing-grounds for the Surr of El-Muwaylah. We camped for the night, after a total march of eleven miles, at the Sayl el-Nagwah, a short Nullah {{at the foot of}} a granite block similarly named; and a gap supplied us with tolerable rain-water.|$|E
6000|$|Another sign of {{superior}} labour {{is shown by}} the quartz-crushing implements. Here they are of three kinds: coarse and rough basaltic lava {{for the first and}} rudest work; red granite and <b>syenitic</b> granite for the next stage; and, lastly, an admirable handmill of the compactest grey granite, smooth as glass and hard as iron. Around the pin-hole are raised and depressed concentric circles intended for ornament; and the [...] "dishing" [...] towards the rim is regular as if turned by machinery. We have seen as yet nothing like this work; nor shall we see anything superior to it. All are nether millstones, so carefully smashed that one can hardly help suspecting the kind of superstitious feeling which suggested iconoclasm.

60|$|The {{southern}} part of this island is mainly formed of mountains of greenstone, which often assumes a <b>syenitic</b> character, and contains much hypersthene. These mountains, in their lower half, are generally encased by strata containing numerous small corals and some shells. These shells have been examined by Mr. G.B. Sowerby, and have been described by him: they consist of two species of Producta, and of six of Spirifera; two of these, namely, P. rugata and S. rotundata, resemble, {{as far as their}} imperfect condition allows of comparison, British mountain-limestone shells. Mr. Lonsdale has had the kindness to examine the corals; they consist of six undescribed species, belonging to three genera. Species of these genera occur in the Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous strata of Europe. Mr. Lonsdale remarks, that all these fossils have undoubtedly a Palaeozoic character, and that probably they correspond in age to a division of the system above the Silurian formations.|$|E
60|$|On the <b>syenitic</b> ridge, {{which forms}} the {{southern}} boundary of Herradura Bay and Plain, I found the Concholepas and Turritella cingulata (mostly in fragments), {{at the height}} of 242 feet above the sea. I could not have told that these shells had not formerly been brought up by man, if I had not found one very small mass of them cemented together in a friable calcareous tuff. I mention this fact more particularly, because I carefully looked, in many apparently favourable spots, at lesser heights on the side of this ridge, and could not find even the smallest fragment of a shell. This is only one instance out of many, proving that the absence of sea-shells on the surface, though in many respects inexplicable, is an argument of very little weight in opposition to other evidence on the recent elevation of the land. The highest point in this neighbourhood at which I found upraised shells of existing species was on an inland calcareous plain, {{at the height of}} 252 feet above the sea.|$|E
60|$|Nurtiung {{contains}} a most remarkable collection of those sepulchral and other monuments, which form so curious a {{feature in the}} scenery of these mountains and in the habits of their savage population. They are all placed in a fine grove of trees, occupying a hollow; where several acres are covered with gigantic, generally circular, slabs of stone, from ten to twenty-five feet broad, supported five {{feet above the ground}} upon other blocks. For the most part they are buried in brushwood of nettles and shrubs, but in one place there is an open area of fifty yards encircled by them, each with a gigantic headstone behind it. Of the latter the tallest was nearly thirty feet high, six broad, and two feet eight inches in thickness, and must have been sunk at least five feet, and perhaps much more, in the ground. The flat slabs were generally of slate or hornstone; but many of them, and all the larger ones, were of <b>syenitic</b> granite, split by heat and cold water with great art. They are erected by dint of sheer brute strength, the lever being the only aid. Large blocks of syenite were scattered amongst these wonderful erections.|$|E
6000|$|After marching {{about six}} miles, we entered a gorge called Umm el-Bíbán, [...] "the Mother of Gates," [...] {{formed by the}} stony spurs of the Wady bank: the number of birds and trees, {{especially}} in the <b>syenitic</b> valleys, showed that water could not be far off. At 10.10 a.m. a halt was called at the half-way place, a bay or hollow in the left cliff, El-Humayrah--"the Little Red"--an overhanging wall of ruddy grit some eighty feet high, with strata varying in depth from a few lines to as many fathoms, all differing in colour, and all honeycombed, fretted, and sculptured by wind and rain. Above the red grit, weathered into a thousand queer shapes, stood strata of chloritic sand, a pale yellow-green, and capping it rose the usual dull-brown carbonate of lime. Large fossil oysters lay in numbers about the base, suggesting a prehistoric feast of the Titans. Amongst them is the monstrous Tridacna (gigantea), which sometimes attains a growth of a yard and a half; {{one of these is}} used as a bénitier at the church of Saint Sulpice, Paris. Amongst the layers were wavy bands of water-rolled crystals, jaspers, bloodstones, iron-revetted pebbles, and [...] "almonds," [...] which, in the Brazil, accompany and betray the diamond.[EN#101] We had no time to make a serious search; but, when the metals shall be worked, it will, perhaps, be advisable to import a skilled prospecter from the Brazil or the Cape of Good Hope.|$|E
6000|$|The usual {{arrangement}} is {{a row of}} five, seven, or more erect oblong blocks with round heads (the highest being placed in the middle), on which are often wooden discs and cones: more rarely pyramids are built. Broad slabs for seats are also common by the wayside. Mr. Yule, who first drew attention to these monuments, mentions one thirty-two feet by fifteen, and two in thickness; and states that the sarcophagi (which, however, are rare) formed of four slabs, resemble a drawing in Bell's Circassia, and descriptions in Irby and Mangles' Travels in Syria. He adds that many villages derive their names from these stones, [...] "mau" [...] signifying [...] "stone:" [...] thus [...] "Mausmai" [...] is [...] "the stone of oath," [...] because, as his native informant said, [...] "there was war between Churra and Mausmai, and when they made peace, they swore to it, and placed a stone as a witness;" [...] forcibly recalling the stone Jacob set up for a pillar, and other passages in the old Testament: [...] "Mamloo" [...] is [...] "the stone of salt," [...] eating salt from a sword's point being the Khasia form of oath: [...] "Mauflong" [...] is [...] "the grassy stone," [...] etc.* [Notes on the Khasia mountains and people; by Lieutenant H. Yule, Bengal Engineers. Analogous combinations occur {{in the south of}} England and in Brittany, etc., where similar structures are found. Thus maen, man, or men is the so-called Druidical name for a stony, whence Pen-maen-mawr, for [...] "the hill of the big stone," [...] Maen-hayr, for the standing stones of Brittany, and Dol-men, °the table-stone," [...] for a cromlech.] Returning from this grove, we crossed a stream by a single squared block, twenty-eight feet long, five broad, and two thick, of gray <b>syenitic</b> granite with large crystals of felspar.|$|E
60|$|Silver, in {{the form}} of a chloride, sulphuret, or an amalgam, or in its native state, and {{associated}} with lead and other metals, and at Arqueros with pure native copper, occurs chiefly in the upper great gypseous or cretaceo-oolitic formation which forms probably the richest mass in Chile. We may instance the mining districts of Arqueros near Coquimbo, and of nearly the whole valley of Copiapo, and of Iquique (where the principal veins run N.E. by E. and S.W. by W.), in Peru. Hence comes Molina's remark, that silver is born in the cold and solitary deserts of the Upper Cordillera. There are, however, exceptions to this rule: at Paral (S.E. of Coquimbo) silver is found in the porphyritic conglomerate formation; as I suspect is likewise the case at S. Pedro de Nolasko in the Peuquenes Pass. Rich argentiferous lead is found in the clay-slate of the Uspallata range; and I saw an old silver-mine in a hill of syenite at the foot of the Bell of Quillota: I was also assured that silver has been found in the andesitic and porphyritic region between the town of Copiapo and the Pacific. I have stated in a previous part of this chapter, that in two neighbouring mines at Arqueros the veins in one were productive when they traversed the singular green sedimentary beds, and unproductive when crossing the reddish beds; whereas at the other mine exactly the reverse takes place; I have also described the singular and rare case of numerous particles of native silver and of the chloride being disseminated in the green rock at the distance of a yard from the vein. Mercury occurs with silver both at Arqueros and at Copiapo: at the base of C. de los Hornos (S.E. of Coquimbo, a different place from Los Hornos, before mentioned) I saw in a <b>syenitic</b> rock numerous quartzose veins, containing a little cinnabar in nests: there were here other parallel veins of copper and of a ferrugino-auriferous ore. I believe tin has never been found in Chile.|$|E
6000|$|The {{prevailing}} rock is gneiss, often passing, by {{the disappearance}} of the quartz and mica, and by the feldspar losing its red colour, into a brilliantly grey primitive greenstone. Not unfrequently quartz and hornblende are arranged in layers in almost amorphous feldspar. There is some fine-grained <b>syenitic</b> granite, orbicularly marked by ferruginous lines, and weathering into vertical, cylindrical holes, almost touching each other. In the gneiss, concretions of granular feldspar and others of garnets with mica occur. The gneiss is traversed by numerous dikes composed of black, finely crystallised, hornblendic rock, containing a little glassy feldspar and sometimes mica, and varying in thickness from mere threads to ten feet: these threads, which are often curvilinear, could sometimes be traced running into the larger dikes. One of these dikes was remarkable from having been in two or three places laterally disjointed, with unbroken gneiss interposed between the broken ends, and in one part with a portion of the gneiss driven, apparently whilst in a softened state, into its side or wall. In several neighbouring places, the gneiss included angular, well- defined, sometimes bent, masses of hornblende rock, quite like, except in being more perfectly crystallised, that forming the dikes, and, at least in one instance, containing (as determined by Professor Miller) augite as well as hornblende. In one or two cases these angular masses, though now quite separate from each other by the solid gneiss, had, from their exact correspondence in size and shape, evidently once been united; hence I cannot doubt that most or all of the fragments have been derived from the breaking up of the dikes, of which we see the first stage in the above- mentioned laterally disjointed one. The gneiss close to the fragments generally contained many large crystals of hornblende, which are entirely absent or rare in other parts: its folia or laminae were gently bent round the fragments, {{in the same manner as}} they sometimes are round concretions. Hence the gneiss has certainly been softened, its composition modified, and its folia arranged, subsequently to the breaking up of the dikes, these latter also having been at the same time bent and softened. (Professor Hitchcock [...] "Geology of Massachusetts" [...] volume 2 page 673, gives a closely similar case of a greenstone dike in syenite.) ...|$|E

It is a hydrothermal mineral derived from low temperature alteration of basalts and related rocks, associated with other zeolites, calcite, quartz and prehnite.

Multiple glaciations intruded into the region from the East, separating it from areas to the north and west, known as Beringia, that were not glaciated, and creating a pocket of rugged terrain. North of the divide, the margins of prior glaciations give way to much gentler permafrost landforms that escaped glaciation,with ice margin formations such as pingos, moraines, ice-wedge polygons and frost mounds.|$|E
50|$|The Rhinns complex {{has been}} {{recognised}} {{in a series}} of four outcrops that form inliers within younger cover sequences of the Dalradian Supergroup and the Colonsay Group. The most easterly of these exposures is on the islands of Colonsay, where the complex consists of strongly retrogressed orthogneisses, although the correlation of this outcrop with the Rhinns complex has been questioned on the basis of new radiometric dating and Hf isotope analyses. On the Rhinns of Islay, gneisses of the Rhinns complex lie unconformably beneath the Colonsay Group, which is correlated with the Dalradian Supergroup. The gneisses on Islay consist of two main types, a dominant medium to coarse-grained <b>syenitic</b> gneiss, which is cut by large intrusions of gabbro (now deformed).

50|$|The {{property}} contained 154 acres, {{with two}} veins worked.

The two veins dipped east at an angle of 36° to 40°. The main shaft was upon the eastern or Providence vein, and {{the greater part of}} the work in the past was prosecuted on this vein. The incline shaft was 1250 ft in depth, ten levels being turned, and extending an average distance of 2000 ft on the vein. The Providence vein was a larger one, running from 2 x 20 ft in size, and averaging over 6 ft. Four shoots of ore were discovered on it, running from 150 x 320 ft in length. These ore shoots all trended to the north. The work on this vein consisted of driving and opening ground on the 1100 ft and 1250 ft levels, and sinking the main shaft.|$|E
50|$|The geology of {{the city}} {{consists}} of two principal types of rocks of an ancient Basement Complex, {{a result of a}} process that took place during the late Pre-Cambrian period about 500 million years ago. The most extensive rock formation consists of pyroxene granulite gneiss which covers more than 50% {{of the city}} area, from the northwest to the east and extends in two small bands southward {{in the western part of}} the city. <b>Syenitic</b> gneiss accounts for about 40% covering the southern, western and north-eastern corner of the city and also in form of scattered small intrusions into the pyroxene granulite gneiss. In their unweathered state, both rock types are impervious hence poor aquifers, but they provide a valuable resource for road and building construction. Blantyre City is on the eastern edge of the southern branch of the Eastern African Rift, and thus some prominent faults occur within and in the vicinity of the city rendering it prone to earthquakes. The main faults and associated zones of deeply fractured bedrock run from the north of the city in a southwesterly direction and are potential aquifers for groundwater.|$|E
50|$|Geraldes & Netto (2004a; b), Silveira et al. (2005) and Valente et al. (2005) {{concluded}} that the trachyte of this area {{was made up of}} lava flows which covered the erosion surface of the <b>syenitic</b> rock. If so, the trachyte must be younger than the syenite. However, field observation of the contact outcrops demonstrated that the trachyte intrudes into the metamorphic syenite, forming an intrusive body older than the syenite (Motoki et al., 2007a). Geraldes & Netto (2004a; b), Silveira et al. (2005) and Valente et al. (2005) considered that the trachyte is distributed only along the valley of the crater in a strip 2 kilometers long and less than 100 meters thick. This body has a horizontal extension larger than 15 kilometers and stretches from the base {{to the top of the}} Mendanha massif, with more than an 800 meter drop in elevation (Motoki et al., 2007a). Valente et al. (2005) show isolated occurrences of hexagonal fractures as evidence of trachyte lava flow. The trachyte does not have the characteristics of lava flow and lava dome (Motoki et al., 2007a). The hexagonal fractures were identified to be horizontal columnar joints of trachyte dike. These geological observations indicate that the trachyte is an intrusive body, being the oldest body of the felsic alkaline magmatism of this area, and is clearly different from the lava flows overlying the eroded surface of the syenite.|$|E
50|$|More recently, on {{the basis}} of field, petrographic, and textural observations, it is argued that these {{geological}} structures are not extraterrestrial impact craters. Field studies of these geological structures found a lack of identifiable shatter cones at both structures. Instead, the striations, which were previously reported shatter cones, are identified as ventifacts created by wind erosion in sandstones. These striations are surficial features that are unrelated to fracturing of the sandstone; are consistently oriented with the prevailing Holocene wind patterns; and occur within and outside of, even distal to, both of the Arkenu structures. In addition, detailed petrographic analyses of rock samples from both of the Arkenu structures found a lack of any microscopic effect of shock metamorphism including a lack of planar deformation features (PDFs) in quartz grains and evidence of impact melting, or presence of glass. A lack of any apparent differences between the sedimentary rocks outcropping inside and outside these circular structures was found. Finally, fieldwork found silicified sandstone dikes and igneous rocks, such as syenite, porphyries, tephrites and phonolites, and lamprophyres (monchiquites) directly associated with each circular feature. Based on these and other observations, it was concluded that the Arkenu structures are stocks of porphyritic <b>syenitic</b> that have intruded the Nubia Formation to form rather simple and eroded ring dike complexes. Hydrothermal activity that followed the intrusion of these ring dike complexes resulted in the formation of massive magnetite-hematite deposits and dikes of silicified sandstone. As a result of this research, the Arkenu structures were removed from and are currently not listed in the Earth Impact Database.|$|E
40|$|<b>Syenitic</b> rocks occupying {{an area of}} {{at least}} 400 (km) ^ 2 in the Yamato Mountains, East Antarctica, are {{classified}} into three major types {{on the basis of}} the field occurrence and petrography; two-pyroxene syenite, clinopyroxene quartz monzo-syenite and clinopyroxene syenite. Major and trace elements Rb, Sr, Zr, Th and U are presented to reveal the petrochemical features of the <b>syenitic</b> rocks. The two-pyroxene syenite which has a charnockitic appearance is the earlier member among the <b>syenitic</b> rocks. The spacial relation between the clinopyroxene quartz monzo-syenite and the clinopyroxene syenite is not observed. All the <b>syenitic</b> rocks show roughly smooth trends in the major elements variation diagrams, but they overlap extensively with increasing SiO_ 2. The Rb, Th and U contents of the <b>syenitic</b> rocks are similar to those of the average crust, and Sr and Zr are much more enriched than the ordinary granitic rocks. The wide range of SiO_ 2 in the clinopyroxene quartz monzo-syenite and higher Rb/Sr and K/Rb ratios in the two-pyroxene syenite than the former might not prove the formation of the clinopyroxene quartz monzo-syenite from the two-pyroxene syenite by magmatic differentiation. On the other hand, it is possible that the clinopyroxene quartz monzo-syenite and the clinopyroxene syenite may be genetically related judging from their petrochemical similarity...|$|E
40|$|The Piquiri Syenite Massif, southernmost Brazil, {{is part of}} the post-collisional {{magmatism}} {{related to}} the Neoproterozoic Brasiliano-Pan-African Orogenic Cycle. The massif is about 12 km in diameter and is composed of syenites, granites, monzonitic rocks and lamprophyres. Diopside-phlogopite, diopside-biotite-augite-calcic-amphibole, are the main ferro-magnesian paragenesis in the <b>syenitic</b> rocks. <b>Syenitic</b> and granitic rocks are co-magmatic and related to an ultrapotassic, silica-saturated magmatism. Their trace element patterns indicate a probable mantle source modified by previous, subduction-related metasomatism. The ultrapotassic granites of this massif were produced by fractional crystallization of <b>syenitic</b> magmas, and may be considered as a particular group of hypersolvus and subsolvus A-type granites. Based upon textural, structural and geochemical data most of the <b>syenitic</b> rocks, particularly the fine-grained types, are considered as crystallized liquids, in spite of the abundance of cumulatic layers, schlieren, and compositional banding. Most of the studied samples are metaluminous, with K 2 O/Na 2 O ratios higher than 2. The ultrapotassic <b>syenitic</b> and lamprophyric rocks in the Piquiri massif are interpreted to have been produced from enriched mantle sources, OIB-type, like most of the post-collisional shoshonitic, sodic alkaline and high-K tholeiitic magmatism in southernmost Brazil. The source of the ultrapotassic and lamprophyric magmas is probably the same veined mantle, with abundant phlogopite + apatite + amphibole that reflects a previous subduction-related metasomatism...|$|E

40|$|The Baima igneous complex (BIC) is {{a member}} of the Permian Emeishan large igneous province, SW China, and is {{composed}} of a layered gabbroic unit and an isotropic <b>syenitic</b> unit. The gabbroic unit consists of four distinct zones, 1) lower cumulate zone, 2) massive Fe-Ti-V oxide ore zone, 3) olivine gabbro zone and 4) upper gabbro zone. SHRIMP zircon U-Pb dating results yield an age of 261 ± 2  Ma for the gabbroic unit, contemporaneous with the spatially associated <b>syenitic</b> unit. The gabbroic rocks show slightly LREE enriched patterns with (La/Yb) N values between 1. 6 and 12. 1 and positive Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 1. 1 - 3. 6). In contrast, the syenites display stronger enrichments of LREE (La/YbN = 6. 8 - 51. 3) and negative Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* = 0. 3 - 1. 1). Rocks of the <b>syenitic</b> unit are chemically similar to the ferroan alkalic A-type granitoids (K 2 O/Na 2 O = 0. 58 - 0. 80, FeOt/(FeOt +MgO) = 0. 80 - 0. 91) and have a within-plate geochemical signature. Both units have similar trace element ratios (Zr/Nb, Th/U, Ni/Co, Cu/Ni, Hf/Ta and Zn/Ga) resembling an ocean-island basalt source. The εNd(T) values for the gabbroic unit (εNd(T) = + 1. 6 -+ 4. 2) and <b>syenitic</b> unit (εNd(T) = + 2. 5 -+ 3. 2) are within the range of the high-Ti Emeishan flood basalts. The geochemical and geochronological data indicate that the gabbroic and <b>syenitic</b> units are comagmatic and cogenetic. Geochemical modeling suggests that the two units originated by fractional crystallization of a common parental magma that resembles the high-Ti Emeishan flood basalts. The formation of the two units by fractional crystallization was likely responsible for the enrichment of Fe-Ti-V oxide minerals in the gabbroic unit and thus the development of the Daly gap. The results of this study indicate that silica saturated peralkaline A-type granitoids can be formed by fractionation of mantle derived mafic magmas. © 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|One of the world's most {{productive}} gold camps is located along the major east-trending Larder Lake fault (LLF), which extends approximately 250 km from Val d'Or to Kirkland Lake. The western {{portion of the}} LLF consists of a 60 km long narrow (less than 5 km wide) and sinuous deformation zone {{commonly referred to as}} the Kirkland Lake-Larder Lake fault zone (KLF). The occurence of two distinct suites of magmatic rocks, <b>syenitic</b> and granitic, in and around the KLF indicates a magmatic duality. It is possible to identify three distinct magmatic domains defined by mode of emplacement, minerology and geochemistry. Mineral chemistry indicates that rocks from both suites evolved under oxidizing conditions in domains 1 and 3. Rare earth element compositions indicate a similar upper mantle source for both magmatic suites. Major element compositions confirm the shoshonitic nature of the <b>syenitic</b> suite, while the granitic suite is comparable to the sanukitoid suite (high-Mg,-K, -LILE andesites). Both the <b>syenitic</b> and granitic suites originate from an upper mantle source that was very probably modified a relatively short time before by fluids and/or melts derived from a subducted slab. The Kirkland Lake area is marked by an early transtensive phase when <b>syenitic</b> and granitic rocks were emplaced in extensional fractures associated to sinistral strike-slip faulting. Uplift of domain 3 and reverse faulting along the Kirkland Lake main break (KLMB) and the LLF are associated with a later transpressive phase; it was during this phase that gold deposits were formed. The structural, mineralogical and geochemical evidence fit in a tectomagmatic model where oblique convergence and accretion dominate...|$|E
40|$|TheMorro doAfonso <b>Syenitic</b> Pluton (MASP) is a small, bimodal {{suite of}} {{lamprophyric}} and <b>syenitic</b> rocks, {{located in the}} Serrinha Nucleus, São Francisco Craton, northeastern Brazil. The unit consists predominantly of alkali feldspar syenite with numerous mafic xenoliths and dykes that are predominantly lamprophyric. The syenite shows geochemical and isotopic features typical of the Roman potassic magmas, i. e. low TiO 2 (up to 1. 2 %), low K 2 O/Al 2 O 3 (0. 33 – 0. 49), strong enrichment in LILE, and high LILE/HFSE ratios. Fractionation, mainly of clinopyroxene and amphibole, explains the transition from lamprophyre to syenite. Magmamixing is required to explain themost evolved compositions. MASP syenites have Paleoproterozoic crystallization ages (2. 11 Ga). The Nd isotope composition of mafic and felsic phases are similar (εNdmafic =− 2. 36 to − 2. 61 and εNdfelsic =− 2. 47) and they have Archaean model ages (TDM = 2. 56 – 2. 58 Ga) that match the age of an inherited zircon grain (ca. 2. 6 Ga). MASP is similar to many other post-orogenic <b>syenitic</b> plutons distributed over a wide area of São Francisco Craton (SFC), which are closely comparable in age and also typically associated with ultrapotassic lamprophyre. The present results suggest that a major proportion of the potassic–ultrapotassic <b>syenitic</b> rocks of the SFC were emplaced in a narrow time interval from 2111 to 2080 Ma, limiting the time of metamorphism peak of the Transamazonian Orogeny to at least 2. 1 Ga.

40|$|The Murdock Creek intrusion, {{immediately}} {{southwest of}} Kirkland Lake, Ontario, {{in the southern}} part of the Abitibi belt, is a member of a suite of late Archean (≈ 2680 Ma) <b>syenitic</b> intrusions located within and adjacent to the Kirkland Lake-Larder Lake fault zone (KLF), which host virtually all of the gold mineralization in the Kirkland Lake camp. An early crystallizing mafic margin consisting of clinopyroxenite, meladiorite, melamonzodiorite, and melasyenite encloses an extensive felsic core of alkali-feldspar syenite. A coeval hornblendite unit with lamprophyric affinities, intrudes throughout the pluton and most closely approximates the mantel-derived liquids which differentiated to produce the suite of <b>syenitic</b> intrusions and possibly potassic alkaline extrusive rocks of the Timiskaming Group. The intrinsically oxidized nature of the pluton suggests a genetic link with gold mineralization in the Kirkland Lake camp. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E

Trace element compositions on 16 {{samples from the}} Belgica Mountains and 4 samples from the Yamato Mountains were determined with an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer. High concentrations of Ba, Rb and Sr with very low levels of Nb, P and Y were found on granitic gneisses. The chemical feature is considered to represent the result of in situ partial melting. Basic and intermediate metamorphic rocks show variable compositions. Some of the rocks have slight enrichment of LIL elements with distinct Nb depletion. The chemical characteristics indicate that the rocks were generated probably under subduction environment. <b>Syenitic</b> rocks from the Belgica Mountains and gneisses from the Yamato Mountains are extremely enriched in Ba, Rb, Sr and Zr.
