The car has a 4-speed manual transmission with synchromesh on gears 2, 3 and 4. An overdrive gearbox was added in 1938,the ratio change being contained in the gearbox {{rather than in a}} separate unit. The car has 4-wheel servo-assisted brakes applied by cable (using a servo made under licence from Hispano-Suiza). The radiator shell is of Staybrite steel.|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} {{differences}} from these precursors to the Chapman strut. As the Lotus Twelve had inboard disk brakes, {{there was no}} need to pass the braking torque through the radius rods. Chapman also avoided the swing axle and its camber changes with suspension travel, in favour of a drive shaft with two universal joints. The connection between the hub carrier and the shock absorber base was made rigid, making the <b>spring</b> <b>unit</b> into a strut and also controlling the camber angle. Using the drive shaft itself to control the rear track meant that the shaft could be of fixed length, avoiding the need for a sliding spline joint and its stiction problems.|$|E

It resembled the Christie suspension outwardly, but was actually a conventional leaf <b>spring</b> <b>unit.</b> The resulting vehicle was reliable, and an export success: 50 were exported to Iran, 24 each to Peru and Switzerland. Lithuania also ordered some. The British Royal Armoured Corps (RAC) had one trial model delivered on March 23, 1939 to Gunnery School at Lulworth. A report stated, the [...] "(bow) gunner could not sit back comfortably as the wireless set was {{in the way of}} his left shoulder." [...] The report also stated that due to the shudder while the vehicle was on the move, it was impossible to lay the gun. Even at the speed of 5 mph accuracy was poor. As a result, the RAC did not purchase the tank and the trial model was returned.|$|E
50|$|In 1935, the Czechoslovak tank {{manufacturer}} ČKD {{was looking}} for a replacement for the LT-35 tank they were jointly producing with Škoda Works. The LT-35 was complex and had shortcomings, and ČKD felt there would be orders both from the expanding Czechoslovak army and for export. ČKD decided to use a suspension with four large wheels for their new tank. It resembled the Christie suspension outwardly, but was actually a conventional leaf <b>spring</b> <b>unit.</b> The resulting vehicle was reliable and {{came to be known as}} LT vz. 38 in Czechoslovak service and designated the Panzer 38(t) in German service. On 1 July 1938, Czechoslovakia ordered 150 of the TNHPS model, which came to be known as the LT vz. 38, and although none had entered service by the time of the German occupation those made were taken over and used by Germany. After the German takeover, Germany ordered continued production of the model as it was considered an excellent tank, especially compared to the Panzer I and Panzer II tanks that were the Panzerwaffe's main tanks. It was first introduced into German service under the name LTM 38; this was changed on 16 January 1940 to Panzerkampfwagen 38(t). Production of tanks for Germany continued into 1942, and amounted to more than 1,400 examples. In German service the 38(t) was used as a substitute for the Panzer III.|$|E

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine whether the modeling approach employed to estimate seepage into waste emplacement drifts yields results that are consistent with the observed seepage in the ESF South Ramp. It is important to realize that the modeling study reported here is not an attempt to predict, reproduce, or analyze the South Ramp seepage data. Such an effort would require the development of a specific model and a specific characterization and analysis approach best suited for capturing the hydrogeologic conditions in the South Ramp as they prevailed before and during the period of the seepage observations. Instead, the conceptual framework and analysis approach developed for the estimation of long-term seepage into waste emplacement drifts in the Topopah <b>Spring</b> <b>unit</b> is used with minimal adjustments to examine whether the results of the probabilistic approach employed in the TSPA-LA (which considers uncertainty and spatial variability in fracture permeability, capillary strength, and local percolation flux) would provide reasonable seepage estimates, even if applied to the conditions in the South Ramp. If so, confidence can be gained that the TSPA-LA approach captures the processes relevant for the prediction of natural seepage into large underground openings...|$|E
30|$|The comfort {{layer is}} divided into three subcategories: the quilt, the {{insulating}} layer, and the cushioning layer. The quilt is the top layer of the mattress. It provides a soft surface texture and a level of firmness that can be varied by changing the material and the details of construction. The quilt consists of the ticking plus low-density foam or fiber batting that is stitched to its underside. These two layers are sewn to a tape edge that attaches to the border quilting {{around the perimeter of the}} mattress. The insulating layer is the first layer next to the innerspring unit. It forms a barrier between the softer foam layers to reduce the likelihood of them “pocketing” into the <b>spring</b> <b>unit</b> and causing a lumpy uncomfortable sleeping surface. The insulating layer can be a fiber batting or layers of non-woven fabrics. The cushioning layer provides an extra layer of comfort, and may include flat or convoluted PUF, shredded pads of compressed polyester, or fiber battings. The insulator and cushioning layers can be stacked in varying sequences between the quilt and the innerspring support. With the introduction of 16 CFR 1633 in 2007, most mattress manufacturers changed to single-sided mattresses because of the expense of complying with flammability regulations for both sides of the bedding (Taylor [2999]).|$|E

40|$|Base {{isolation}} {{by spring}} system for earthquake prevention. this idea {{deals with the}} prevention of the structure from the earthquake waves or seismic waves by isolating {{the base of the}} structure by using high tension springs. Usually the structure is laid on the ground with proper foundations. But in this technique the base of the structure i. e., just above the foundation is being isolated. So that it might not be effected by seismic waves. This technique utilizes high tensile, high stiffness springs which can be made according to the tensile force they need to hold from the structure. This <b>spring</b> <b>unit</b> is attached {{to the base of the}} structure and by this way base of the structure is being isolated. Isolation with the help of a spring system can be effective in many ways as it can reduce upto 80 to 85 % of the risk, i. e. being developed by the seismic waves and prevent the structure from damage. In this paper, the present behavior of the spring isolation system is being analyzed and the advancement in this system is also being discussed. On the basis of authors study the modernization of the whole picture has been described in the paper.

40|$|A {{drill bit}} loader is {{described}} for loading a tapered shank of a drill bit into a similarly tapered recess {{in the end}} of a drill spindle. The spindle has a transverse slot at the inner end of the recess. The end of the tapered shank of the drill bit has a transverse tang adapted to engage in the slot so that the drill bit will be rotated by the spindle. The loader {{is in the form of}} a cylinder adapted to receive the drill bit with the shank projecting out of the outer end of the cylinder. Retainer pins prevent rotation of the drill bit in the cylinder. The spindle is lowered to extend the shank of the drill bit into the recess in the spindle and the spindle is rotated to align the slot in the spindle with the tang on the shank. A <b>spring</b> <b>unit</b> in the cylinder is compressed by the drill bit during its entry into the recess of the spindle and resiliently drives the tang into the slot in the spindle when the tang and slot are aligned. In typical remote drilling operations, whether in hot cells or water pits, drill bits have been held using a collet or end mill type holder with set screws. In either case, to load or change a drill bit required the use master-slave manipulators to position the bits and tighten the collet or set screws. This requirement eliminated many otherwise useful work areas because they were not equipped with slaves, particularly in water pits...|$|E
40|$|In groundwater-fed springs, habitat {{characteristics}} are primarily {{determined by a}} complex combination of geomorphic features and physico-chemical parameters, while species assemblages are even more intricate. Springs host species either inhabiting the spring mouth, or colonizing spring habitats from the surface or from the aquifers which feed the springs. Groundwater species living in springs have been claimed as good candidates for identifying dual aquifer flowpaths or changes in groundwater pathways before reaching the spring outlets. However, the reliability of spring species as hydrological biotracers has not been widely investigated so far. Our study was aimed at analysing a large karstic spring system at three nested spatial scales in order: i) to assess, at whole spring system scale, {{the presence of a}} groundwater divide separating two aquifers feeding two spring units within a single spring system, by combining isotope analyses, physico-chemistry, and copepod distribution patterns; ii) to test, at vertical spring system scale, the effectiveness of copepods in discriminating surface and subsurface habitat patches within the complex mosaic spring environment; iii) to explore, at local <b>spring</b> <b>unit</b> level, the relative role of hydrochemistry and sediment texture as describers of copepod distribution among microhabitats. The results obtained demonstrated the presence of a hierarchical spatial structure, interestingly reflected in significant differences in assemblage compositions. Copepod assemblages differed between the two contiguous spring units, which were clearly characterized by their hydrochemistry and by significant differences in the groundwater flowpaths and recharge areas, as derived by the isotope analyses. The biological results suggested that stygobiotic species seem {{to be related to the}} origin of groundwater, suggesting their potential role as hydrological biotracers. At vertical scale, assemblage composition in surface and subsurface habitats was significantly different, both between spring units and among microhabitats, supporting strong habitat preferences of copepod species. At the smaller local scale, the response to habitat patchiness of subsurface copepod assemblages resulted in distribution patterns primarily defined by sediment texture, while the sensitivity to differences in hydrochemistry was negligible. </p...|$|E

University of Missouri [...] Columbia 2009. Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Geological sciences. The {{purpose of this study was}} to look at the control of fluids and fluid composition on recrystallization of quartzites in the Eureka Valley - Joshua Flat - Beer Creek pluton contact aureole (EJB), in the White - Inyo Mountains of eastern California. The aureole shows varying degrees of recrystallization and deformation. Fluid inclusions were analyzed by microthermometry, laser ablation - inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry, and Raman spectoscopy, to define the compositions of fluids that were responsible for the contrasting styles of deformation and recrystallization. The inclusions were grouped into three types based on composition: Type I inclusions are strictly aqueous inclusions with various salts. Type II inclusions are mixed aqueous - carbonic inclusions with an aqueous liquid phase and a vapor bubble with a double meniscus of CO 2 fluid and vapor. Type III inclusions have an aqueous - hydrogen sulfide liquid and a single - phase CO₂ - CH₄ vapor. Isochores were developed using LA - ICP - MS and microthermometry data to determine the trapping environment of the inclusions. The isochores show an extensive range of P - T conditions of trapping for all types of inclusions, indicating that the P - T history of the EJB aureole is complex, and that all inclusions appear to have undergone the same complicated history. This study suggests that the fluids trapped in the EJB aureole quartzites are metamorphic from the Antler orogeny. Fluid composition has played a role in the recrystallization history of this quartzite. It is also probable that the pattern of recrystallization seen in the EJB aureole has strongly been influenced by the amount of strain taken up by the Mule <b>Spring</b> <b>unit,</b> allowing theinner aureole to be unaffected by the pluton intrusion. The higher Ca concentrations in fluids in the inner aureole may also have retarded recrystallization of quartzite in the inner aureole...|$|E

50|$|It {{was based}} on the same {{platform}} chassis as the Citroën 2CV, sharing its advanced independent front to rear interconnected suspension. This comprised a central <b>springing</b> <b>unit,</b> running fore-and-aft in a tube on each side; each suspension arm on that side was linked to the spring, by a tie-rod and a 'knife-edge' pivot-pin. Early cars did not have conventional shock absorbers. See Citroën 2CV for detailed information. The squeak heard from most 2CVs and Dyanes as they go over bumps is due to lack of lubrication either inside the spring tubes or to the 'knife-edges'. The front hubs kingpins need to be greased every 600 miles. Since this is often overlooked, the king-pins can be prone to wear, although some movement is acceptable.|$|R
