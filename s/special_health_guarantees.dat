These children scored significantly lower on teacher-rated social-emotional and learning competencies prior to school compared to a control group of children without <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs. Multiple regression analyses indicated that being identified with a <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care need prior to school predicted lower social-emotional and learning competencies in the early years of school.

40|$|Ninety-seven {{percent of}} {{children}} who have <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs are cared for by their mothers. These mothers cite that their informal care work can be intrinsically rewarding, however, the role is not without substantial difficulties and consequences. We investigated differences in {{the health and well-being}} of mothers whose young children do and do not have <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs. Quantitative data are drawn from Growing Up in Australia: The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. This study employs a matched-case control methodology to compare the experiences of a group of 292 mothers whose children are identified as having long term <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs to those mothers whose children are typically developing at two time points; Wave 1 (2004) and Wave 3 (2008). The findings support previous research that mothers of children with <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs have poorer general health and mental health than mothers whose children do not have special needs. Mothers of children with <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs also perceived life as more difficult. Longitudinally, this study also shows that maternal well-being remains relatively stable during the years when children are transitioning to formal schooling.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{children}} with <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs surviving infancy and attending school has been increasing. Due to their health status, these children {{may be at risk}} of low social-emotional and learning competencies (e. g., Lightfoot, Mukherjee, & Sloper, 2000; Zehnder, Landolt, Prchal, & Vollrath, 2006). Early social problems have been linked to low levels of academic achievement (Ladd, 2005), inappropriate behaviours at school (Shiu, 2001) and strained teacher-child relationships (Blumberg, Carle, O‘Connor, Moore, & Lippmann, 2008). Early learning difficulties have been associated with mental health problems (Maughan, Rowe, Loeber, & Stouthamer-Loeber, 2003), increased behaviour issues (Arnold, 1997), delinquency (Loeber & Dishion, 1983) and later academic failure (Epstein, 2008). Considering the importance of these areas, the limited research on <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs in social-emotional and learning domains is a factor driving this research. The purpose of the current research is to investigate social-emotional and learning competence in the early years for Australian children who have <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs. The data which informed this thesis was from Growing up in Australia: The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. This is a national, longitudinal study being conducted by the Commonwealth Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. The study has a national representative sample, with data collection occurring biennially, in 2004 (Wave 1), 2006 (Wave 2) and 2008 (Wave 3). Growing up in Australia uses a cross-sequential research design involving two cohorts, an Infant Cohort (0 - 1 at recruitment) and a Kindergarten Cohort (4 - 5 at recruitment). This study uses the Kindergarten Cohort, for which there were 4, 983 children at recruitment. Three studies were conducted to address the objectives of this thesis. Study 1 used Wave 1 data to identify and describe Australian children with <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs. Children who identified as having <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs through the <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs screener were selected. From this, descriptive analyses were run. The results indicate that boys, children with low birth weight and children from families with low levels of maternal education are likely to be in the population of children with <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs. Further, these children are likely to be using prescription medications, have poor general health and are likely to have specific condition diagnoses. Study 2 used Wave 1 data to examine differences between children with <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs and their peers in social-emotional competence and learning competence prior to school. Children identified by the <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs screener were chosen for the case group (n = 650). A matched case control group of peers (n = 650), matched on sex, cultural and linguistic diversity, family socioeconomic position and age, were the comparison group. Social-emotional competence was measured through Social/Emotional Domain scores taken from the Growing up in Australia Outcome Index, with learning competence measured through Learning Domain scores. Results suggest statistically significant differences in scores between the two groups. Children with <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs have lower levels of social-emotional and learning competence prior to school compared to their peers. Study 3 used Wave 1 and Wave 2 data {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs at Wave 1 and social-emotional competence and learning competence at Wave 2, as children started school. The sample for this study consisted of children in the Kindergarten Cohort who had teacher data at Wave 2. Results from multiple regression models indicate that <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs prior to school (Wave 1) significantly predicts social-emotional competence and learning competence in the early years of school (Wave 2). These results indicate that having <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs prior to school is a risk factor for the social-emotional and learning domains in the early years of school. The results from these studies give valuable insight into Australian children with <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs and their social-emotional and learning competence in the early years. The Australia population of children with <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs were primarily male children, from families with low maternal education, were likely to be of poor health and taking prescription medications. It was found that children with <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs were likely to have lower social-emotional competence and learning competence prior to school compared to their peers. Results indicate that <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs prior to school were predictive of lower social-emotional and learning competencies in the early years of school. More research is required into this unique population and their competencies over time. However, the current research provides valuable insight into an under researched 'at risk' population...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Numerous {{studies have}} {{examined}} racial and ethnic differences in access to and utilization of health services. However, few studies have addressed these issues with respect to children with <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs. This study examines whether disparities in access and utilization are present among black, white, and Hispanic children identified as having <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs. METHODS: We analyzed data on 57 553 children younger than 18 years old included in the 1994 - 95 National Health Interview Survey on Disability. Of these, 10 169, or 17. 7 % of the sample, were identified as having an existing <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care need. Bivariate and multivariate analyses {{were used to assess}} how race and ethnicity are related to measures of access and utilization, such as usual source of care, missed care, and use of physician and hospital services. RESULTS: Our analyses show that among children with <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs, minorities were more likely than white children to be without health insurance coverage (13. 2 % vs 10. 3 %; P <. 01), to be without usual source of care (6. 7 % vs 4. 3 %; P <. 01), and to report inability to get needed medical care (3. 9 % vs 2. 8 %; P <. 05). Also, white children with <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs were more likely than their minority counterparts to have used physician services (88. 6 vs 85. 0; P <. 01); however, minority children with <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs {{were more likely to have}} been hospitalized during the past year (7. 6 % vs 6. 3 %; P < 0. 5). After adjustments for confounding variables (income, insurance coverage, health status, and other variables), racial and ethnic differences in access and utilization were attenuated but remained significant for several measures (without a usual source of care, receipt of care outside of a doctor's office or HMO, no regular clinician, no doctor contacts in past year, and volume of doctor contacts). Gaps in access were more frequent and generally larger for Hispanic children with <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis indicates that access and utilization disparities remain between white and minority children with <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs, with Hispanic children experiencing especially disparate care...|$|R

40|$|The broad {{objective}} of this dissertation research {{was to examine the}} health care system experiences of a vulnerable population: children with complex <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs. This dissertation consists of three related studies designed to address gaps in the current literature, with the goal of informing policy discussions surrounding children with complex needs. 	The first study developed a measure to identify and describe children with complex <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs and applied this measure to the 2005 National Survey of Children with <b>Special</b> <b>Health</b> Care Needs. Compared to children with low to moderately complex <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs, high complexity children present a unique diagnostic profile and a high level of unmet needs. Additionally, families with high complexity children frequently report logistical and provider level barriers to care not commonly reported among the broader special needs population. The second study, utilizing the measure of complexity developed in the first study, presents a profile of care coordination services for children with complex health care needs and presents support for the hypothesis that receiving adequate care coordination is associated with reductions in unmet needs for services. However, only 35. 6 % of high complexity children receive effective care coordination. For the third study, 122 parents whose children attended a pediatric home ventilator clinic (84 % of the patient population) completed a survey in order to assess the themes of unmet need and care coordination among children dependent on ventilators. More than half of families reported unmet needs for care, most frequently therapeutic services and home health care. There was a low level of unmet need for preventive and specialty care. Overall, this research demonstrates that children with complex <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs should be the focus of independent studies and policy discussions. Future research that does not separate the heterogeneous population of children with <b>special</b> <b>health</b> care needs by complexity will fail to identify the unique barriers to care faced by this group, leading to policies that do not benefit high complexity children and their families...|$|R
