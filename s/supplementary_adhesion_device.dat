40|$|Adhesive organs enable insects to {{reversibly}} {{adhere to}} substrates even during rapid locomotion. In this process {{a very fast}} but reliable change of adhesion and detachment is realised. These abilities had aroused high interest by scientists many years ago, trying to create artificial reusable <b>adhesion</b> <b>devices.</b> Within the frame of this thesis the detailed structures and the functionalites of the adhesive organs of the stick insect Carausius morosus were analysed {{and based on the}} obtained data artificial <b>adhesion</b> <b>devices</b> were constructed and finally validated. Initially, the morphology and the ultrastructure of the adhesive organs was analysed using SEM, TEM, CLSM, micro-CT, FIB and light microscopy. By these analyses the detailed ultrastructure of the smooth adhesive organs of stick insects, the so called arolia, and of the hairy adhesive organs, the so called euplantulae, could be revealed. Especially, new insights into the structure of the treelike branching fibres within the procuticula were obtained, which support the thin membranous epicuticula by which arolia are covered. Presumably, this very thin epicuticula can conform to the smallest surface roughnesses and the treelike branching fibres support the epicuticula without preventing its flexibility. Due to this design smooth adhesive organs most likely can conform to substrates so close, that adhesion forces on the basis of van der Waals forces were developed. Several further issues concerning the adhesion of stick insects were analysed {{in the course of this}} thesis. Among others the development of a new method for the determination of the Young´s modulus of thin and superficial membranes enabled to determine the Young´s modulus of the epicuticula. In this method arolia of stick insects adhering upside down to a latex membrane were stretched by stretching the latex membrane. Meanwhile, the elongation of the contact area between the arolium and the latex membrane was recorded. The observed elongations were analysed using finite element simulations yielding Young´s moduli of about 60 MPa. This value is much higher than the values determined or assumed for the epicuticula of adhesive organs before. Based on all results four construction plans for the fabrication of artificial <b>adhesion</b> <b>devices</b> were developed. All construction plans contained an outer, thin, flexible and adhesive membrane out of a silicone, which was supported by different resilient substructures. In the first <b>adhesion</b> <b>device</b> the substructure consisted of a silicone foam and in the second <b>adhesion</b> <b>device</b> the substructure was formed by an array of parallel fibres, orientated at an angle of 57 deg. The third <b>adhesion</b> <b>device</b> included thin flock fibres, which were orientated about perpendicularly to the adhesive surface of the <b>adhesion</b> <b>device</b> and which were infused with a very elastical silicone gel. In the fourth <b>adhesion</b> <b>device</b> the substructure was solely made out of the same elastic silicone gel, which found a use in the third <b>adhesion</b> <b>device.</b> During the course of this thesis the constructional ideas how to fabricate artificial <b>adhesion</b> <b>devices</b> were submitted to the Deutsches Patent- und Markenamt. Among the four <b>adhesion</b> <b>devices</b> the one with flock fibres showed the highest adhesion force of about 1. 25 N/sq cm, which is a bit higher than the adhesion force of stick insects without the contribution of friction. This high adhesion force seems to be based on the reinforcement of the <b>adhesion</b> <b>device</b> with fibres, by which pulling forces are uniformly transferred to the contact area of the <b>adhesion</b> <b>device</b> to the substrate. A non-uniform loading of the contact area easily leads to a local detachment at the area of the highest loading, which could lead to a gradual detachment of the whole <b>adhesion</b> <b>device.</b> Such a gradual detachment goes along with small adhesion forces. Taking into account all results, a new construction plan for the fabrication of artificial <b>adhesion</b> <b>devices</b> was developed. According to this plan <b>adhesion</b> <b>devices</b> should be covered with a preferably thin membrane with a high Young´s modulus. This membrane should be supported by a substructure made of a resilient and elastic foam or gel. Besides, the substructure should be reinforced by very thin fibres, which equip the <b>adhesion</b> <b>devices</b> with a high tensile strength without reducing the resiliency of the substructure. Biomimetic <b>adhesion</b> <b>devices</b> fabricated according to this construction plan should show high adhesion forces as well as high resistances against abrasion and contamination...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The cell-substratum {{interaction}} was studied in cultures of osteoclasts {{isolated from the}} medullary bone of laying hens kept on low calcium diet. In fully spread osteoclasts, cellsubstratum adhesion mostly occurred within a continuous paramarginal area that corresponded also {{to the location of}} a thick network of intermediate filaments of the vimentin type. In this area, regular rows of short protrusions contacting the substratum and often forming a cup-shaped adhesion area were observed in the electron microscope. These short protrusions showed a core of F-actin-containing material presumably organized as a network of microfilaments and surrounded by a rosette-like structure in which vinculin and o~-actinin were found by immunofluorescence microscopy. Rosettes were superposable to dark circles in interference-reflection microscopy and thus represented circular forms of close cell-substratum contact. The core of ventral protrusions also contained, beside F-actin, fimbrin and a-actinin. Villin was absent. This form of cell-substratum contact occurring at the tip of a short ventral protrusion differed from other forms of cell-substratum contact and represented an osteoclastspecific <b>adhesion</b> <b>device</b> that might also be present in in vivo osteoclasts as well as in other normal and transformed cell types...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes of {{deterioration}} of steel bridges. It may cause metal loss and fatigue cracks in the steel components, which would lead to the collapse of steel bridges. This paper presents an automated sensing system to detect corrosion, crack, and other kinds of defects using a GMR (Giant Magnetoresistance) sensor array. Defects will change the relative permeability and electrical conductivity of the material. As a result, magnetic field density generated by ferromagnetic material and the magnetic wheels will be changed. The defects are able to be detected by using GMR sensor array to measure the changes of magnetic flux density. In this study, magnetic wheels are used not only as the <b>adhesion</b> <b>device</b> of the robot, but also as an excitation source to provide the exciting magnetic field for the sensing system. Furthermore, compared to the eddy current method and the MFL (magnetic flux leakage) method, this sensing system suppresses the noise from lift-off value fluctuation by measuring the vertical component of induced magnetic field that is perpendicular to the surface of the specimen in the corrosion inspection. Simulations and experimental results validated the feasibility of the system for the automated defect inspection...|$|R
40|$|Drawing {{inspiration}} from the adhesion abilities of a leaf beetle found in nature, we have engineered a switchable <b>adhesion</b> <b>device.</b> The device combines two concepts: The surface tension force from {{a large number of}} small liquid bridges can be significant (capillarity-based adhesion) and these contacts can be quickly made or broken with electronic control (switchable). The device grabs or releases a substrate in {{a fraction of a second}} via a low-voltage pulse that drives electroosmotic flow. Energy consumption is minimal because both the grabbed and released states are stable equilibria that persist with no energy added to the system. Notably, the device maintains the integrity of an array of hundreds to thousands of distinct interfaces during active reconfiguration from droplets to bridges and back, despite the natural tendency of the liquid toward coalescence. We demonstrate the scaling of adhesion strength with the inverse of liquid contact size. This suggests that strengths approaching those of permanent bonding adhesives are possible as feature size is scaled down. In addition, controllability is fast and efficient because the attachment time and required voltage also scale down favorably. The device features compact size, no solid moving parts, and is made of common materials...|$|R
40|$|Fibrillar {{structures}} are common {{features on the}} feet of many animals, such as geckos, spiders and flies. Theoretical analyses often use periodical array to simulate the assembly, and each fibril {{is assumed to be}} of equal load sharing (ELS). On the other hand, studies on a single fibril show that the adhesive interface is flaw insensitive when the size of the fibril is not larger than a critical one. In this paper, the Dugdale-Barenblatt model has been used to study the conditions of ELS and how to enhance adhesion by tuning the geometrical parameters in fibrillar structures. Different configurations in an array of fibres are considered, such as line array, square and hexagonal patterns. It is found that in order to satisfy flaw-insensitivity and ELS conditions, the number of fibrils and the pull-off force of the fibrillar interface depend significantly on the fibre separation, the interface interacting energy, the effective range of cohesive interaction and the radius of fibrils. Proper tuning of the geometrical parameters will enhance the pull-off force of the fibrillar structures.

It {{acts as an}} <b>adhesion</b> <b>device</b> in parasitic worms, several flatworms, cephalopods, certain fishes, amphibians, and bats. It is a muscular structure for suction on a host or substrate. In parasitic annelids, flatworms and roundworms, suckers are the organs of attachment to the host tissues. In tapeworms and flukes, they are a parasitic adaptation for attachment on the internal tissues of the host, such as intestines and blood vessels. In roundworms and flatworms they serve as attachment between individuals particularly during mating. In annelids, a sucker can be both a functional mouth and a locomotory organ. The structure and number of suckers are often used as basic taxonomic diagnosis between different species, since they are unique in each species. In tapeworms there are two distinct classes of suckers, namely [...] "bothridia" [...] for true suckers, and [...] "bothria" [...] for false suckers.

40|$|Gecko {{and many}} insects have adopted {{nanoscale}} fibrillar structures {{on their feet}} as <b>adhesion</b> <b>devices.</b> Here, we consider adhesion between a single fiber and a substrate by van der Waals or electrostatic interactions. For a given contact area A, the theoretical pull-off force of the fiber is σthA where σth is the theoretical strength of adhesion. We show {{that it is possible}} to design an optimal shape of the tip of the fiber to achieve the theoretical pull-off force. However, such design tends to be unreliable at the macroscopic scale because the pull-off force is sensitive to small variations in the tip shape. We find that a robust design of shape-insensitive optimal adhesion becomes possible only when the diameter of the fiber is reduced to length scales on the order of 100 nm. In general, optimal adhesion could be achieved by a combination of size reduction and shape optimization. The smaller the size, the less important the shape. At large contact sizes, optimal adhesion could still be achieved if the shape can be manufactured to a sufficiently high precision. The robust design of optimal adhesion at nanoscale provides a plausible explanation for the convergent evolution of hairy attachment systems in biology...|$|R

At the micro level the system is simulated by an elastic chain of particles interacting with a rigid foundation through breakable springs. Such system {{can be viewed as}} prototypical for the description {{of a wide range of}} phenomena from peeling of polymeric tapes, to rolling of cells, working of gecko's fibrillar structures and denaturation of DNA. We construct a rigorous continuum limit of the discrete model which captures both stable and metastable configurations and present a detailed parametric study of the interplay between elastic and cohesive interactions. We show that the model reproduces the experimentally observed abrupt transition from an incremental evolution of the adhesion front to a sudden complete decohesion of a macroscopic segment of the adhesion layer. As the microscopic parameters vary the macroscopic response changes from quasi-ductile to quasi-brittle, with corresponding decrease in the size of the adhesion hysteresis. At the micro-scale this corresponds to a transition from a `localized' to a `diffuse' structure of the decohesion front (domain wall). We obtain an explicit expression for the critical debonding threshold in the limit when the internal length scales are much smaller than the size of the system.

Immediately following interstitial injections of tracer particles (ferritin, thorium, carbon, and latex spheres), many of the overlapped endothelial cells are separated and thus passageways are provided between the interstitium and lymphatic lumen. Tracer particles also occur in plasmalemmal invaginations along both connective tissue and luminal fronts. All of the tracer particles accumulate within large autophagic-like vacuoles. Very few particles of ferritin are observed in the endothelium after 24 hr; however, the vesicles containing the nonprotein tracer particles (carbon, thorium, and latex) increase in size and content and remain within the lymphatic endothelial cells up to 6 months.

40|$|A {{capillary}} based <b>adhesion</b> <b>device</b> motivates {{the study}} of coupled free-interface shapes and {{the transition from the}} drop to bridge shape. When a large number of drops, pinned at circular contact lines, are touched to a surface they form liquid bridges, and these bridges create an adhesive force. Alternatively, if the drops are not brought to the surface quickly enough the drops will coarsen, forming instead one large drop. Consider first the coarsening process. The dissipation occurs primarily in the conduits, the drop retain their equilibrium shape - the spherical cap. Drops scavenge volume from one another based on pressure differences, proportional to the surface tension, and arising from curvature differences. This process minimizes the total surface energy. All fixed points and their linear stabilities, obtained analytically, are found to be independent of connectivity. The system coarsens in the sense that, with time, volume is increasingly localized and ends up in a single 'winner' drop. To determine which of the stable fixed points will be the winner, manifolds separating the attracting regions are found using a method which combines local information (eigenvectors at fixed points) with global information (invariant manifolds due to symmetry). The coarsening rate is predicted heuristically, with the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) model and compared against numerical simulations for a variety of networks. Distributions of large drop volumes from LSW are independent of network topology; in contrast, simulation results depend weakly on the network dimension. When a pinned drop touches a solid surface it forms a liquid bridge; here the energy is dissipated within the bridge. The dissipated energy is equal to the loss of surface energy, which can also be expressed in terms of forces along the interface using a geometric relation. This energy balance provides an extra relation which determines the microscopic nature of the contact line. Boundary integral method simulations are used to compute the flow field and viscous bending of the free interface. The energy balance is applied to simulations to find slip lengths. The energy balance is used to bound the microscopic contact angle analytically...|$|R

The dwell time dependence of the adhesive strength of crosslinked poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) in contact with glass and uncrosslinked styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) in contact with glass and with itself was tested with a spherical probe in a confined Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) geometry. Analysis of the contact images revealed several unique separation mechanisms which are dependent on dwell time and interfacial properties. PDMS-glass interfaces show essentially no dependence of adhesion on the dwell time while the adhesive strength and separation mechanisms of SBR interfaces are shown to vary drastically for dwell times ranging from 40 to 10 ? 000 ms. This influence of dwell time is particularly pronounced for polymer-polymer (SBR-SBR) interfaces. Observations of cavitation due to trapped air pockets {{in the center of the}} contact at very short contact times illustrate a transition between a defect-controlled debonding and an interface-controlled debonding which has not been previously reported...|$|R
40|$|The {{oral route}} is {{preferred}} for systemic drug administration and provides {{direct access to}} diseased tissue of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. However, many drugs have poor absorption upon oral administration due to damaging enzymatic and pH conditions, mucus and cellular permeation barriers, and limited time for drug dissolution. To overcome these limitations and enhance oral drug absorption, micron-scale devices with planar, asymmetric geometries, termed microdevices, {{have been designed to}} adhere to the lining of the GI tract and release drug at high concentrations directly toward GI epithelium. Here we seal microdevices with nanostraw membranes—porous nanostructured biomolecule delivery substrates—to enhance the properties of these devices. We demonstrate that the nanostraws facilitate facile drug loading and tunable drug release, limit the influx of external molecules into the sealed drug reservoir, and increase the <b>adhesion</b> of <b>devices</b> to epithelial tissue. These findings highlight the potential of nanostraw microdevices to enhance the oral absorption {{of a wide range of}} therapeutics by binding to the lining of the GI tract, providing prolonged and proximal drug release, and reducing the exposure of their payload to drug-degrading biomolecules...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} flame {{treatment}} of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) {{on the work}} of adhesion (W) and energy release rate (G) were assessed by a custom-built <b>adhesion</b> testing <b>device</b> (ATD). The contact area and the vertical displacement between planar LDPE films and PDMS lenses (untreated and UV/ozone treated) were varied {{as a function of the}} applied load, P. The adhesion and pull-off forces between the extracted PDMS lenses and the LDPE films were studied as a function of the duration of the flame treatment expressed in treatment numbers. A fracture mechanics approach was used to relate the applied load and the radius of the contact area to the energy release rate (G). The difference between the energy release rate and the thermodynamic work of adhesion, defined as the adhesion hysteresis (G - W), increased systematically with increasing treatment numbers for both lens types. In addition, the adhesion hysteresis appeared to be dependent on the contact time. Finally, the origin of the adhesion hysteresis was discussed. It was concluded that bonding by surface functional groups may be the dominating mechanisms for the changes in the observed hysteresis...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{present a}} hydrogel/poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) hybrid {{bioreactor}}. The bioreactor enables a low shear stress 3 D culture by integrating a hydrogel {{as a barrier}} into a PDMS casing. The use of PDMS allows the reversible <b>adhesion</b> of the <b>device</b> to a commercially available microelectrode array. A two-step molding process facilitates this relatively simple, cost effective, and leakage-free add-on microculture system. Agarose (2 %) is used as hydrogel barrier material and mass transport is evaluated by fluorescein isothiocyanate-albumin fluorescence under static conditions which yields a diffusion coefficient of average value of 2. 2 × 10 - 7 cm 2 s- 1 across the barrier. To validate our bioreactor for diffusion limited 3 D cell culture, rat cortical cells were successfully cultured in Matrigel for 6 days. © 2013 American Vacuum Society...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Commonly used <b>adhesion</b> {{prevention}} <b>devices</b> either {{cannot be}} applied or {{are difficult to}} use via laparoscopy. A viscoelastic gel was developed specifically for adhesion prophylaxis during minimally invasive surgery. METHODS: Randomized, third party-blinded, parallel-group design conducted at four centres. Patients (18 – 46 years old) underwent laparoscopic surgery with second look 6 – 10 weeks later. Viscoelastic gel coated adnexa and adjacent tissues. Blinded reviews of videotapes were quantified by American Fertility Society (AFS) adhesion scores. RESULTS: In 25 treatment patients, surgery was performed on 45 adnexa. Coverage of surgical sites at risk for adhesions was typically accomplished with, 15 ml of viscoelastic gel which was delivered in, 90 s. In 24 control patients, surgery alone was performed on 41 adnexa. Treated adnexa showed a decrease in AFS score (11. 9 – 9. 1). In contrast, control adnexa showed an increase in AFS score (8. 8 – 15. 8). This difference in second-look AFS scores (42 % reduction) is significant (P < 0. 01). Ninety-three per cent of treated adnexa {{did not have a}} worse adhesion score in contrast to 56 % of control adnexa. Combining scores into prognostic categories also show significant treatment effect of the viscoelastic gel (P < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: Viscoelastic gel was easy to use via laparoscopy and produced significant reduction in adnexal adhesions. It provides benefits to patients undergoing gynaecological surgery...|$|R
40|$|Most {{cases of}} candidosis have been {{attributed}} to Candida albicans, but recently non-Candida albicans Candida species have been identified as frequent human pathogens. Candida pathogenicity has been attributed to several factors, including <b>adhesion</b> to medical <b>devices</b> and/or host cells, biofilm formation, and secretion of hydrolytic enzymes (proteases, phospholipases, and haemolysins). Although ‘new’ Candida species are emerging, there is still a lack of information about their pathogenicity. This review discusses recent advances in our knowledge of C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, and C. tropicalis virulence factors, specifically those of adhesion and biofilm formation, which are key components in Candida pathogenicity.

40|$|Nanoelectromechanical (NEM) {{switches}} exhibit abrupt switching {{behavior and}} near-zero leakage current making them promising alternatives to conventional semiconductor switches. However, they require high actuation voltages and commonly suffer from permanent <b>adhesion</b> of <b>device</b> components leading to failure. This thesis proposes a novel NEM switch, or "squitch", that overcomes these challenges by electromechanical modulation of tunneling current through a nanometer-thick gap defined by an organic thin-film sandwiched between two electrodes. The switching is initiated by an applied voltage compressing the organic film {{to reduce the}} tunneling width leading to an exponential increase in the tunneling current. The deformed organic material prevents direct contact of the electrodes, while also providing the restoring force necessary {{to turn off the}} switch when the electrostatic force is removed, mitigating stiction-induced failure. In this thesis, the feasibility of the proposed switching mechanism is investigated through theoretical analysis of two- and three-terminal devices, demonstrating the possibility of energy efficient operation in the sub- 1 V regime, with nanoseconds switching time and a large on-off current ratio of greater than 106. Based on the theoretical studies, design requirements are identified to guide the fabrication process of the proposed devices. Various methods of fabricating these devices have been developed, the details of which are outlined in this work. by Farnaz Niroui. Thesis (S. M.)
