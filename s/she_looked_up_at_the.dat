60|$|The woman hesitated. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{clock and}} down again.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> spire {{and then}} {{at him with a}} faintly quizzical expression.|$|E
60|$|Gertrude shivered with pain. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{pictures}} {{hanging over}} Rilla's desk {{and felt a}} sudden hatred of Mona Lisa's endless smile.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him; it was {{the very}} spot on which a couple of hours before <b>she</b> had <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her mother. [...] "You're free--you're free." ...|$|R
60|$|Her eyebrows were faintly contracted. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him pathetically.|$|R
60|$|Wingate laughed softly. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} {{twinkling}} eyes.|$|R
60|$|Silas confounded {{himself in}} {{explanations}} and apologies; {{in the middle}} of these <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clock and clapped her hands together with a suppressed scream.|$|E
60|$|The person {{making this}} polite inquiry {{appeared}} {{at the foot of}} the stairs--a plump and comely woman of middle age. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> young lady with a pleasant smile.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky, {{which had}} a brightness, though {{the light of the}} sun had left it and that of the stars hadn't begun. [...] "It is a lovely evening." ...|$|E
60|$|He obeyed mutely. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} bright, unquailing eyes.|$|R
60|$|And <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, half smiling, half pouting; {{altogether}} bewitching.|$|R
60|$|She {{had been}} brooding. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him {{suddenly}} in surprise.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky, {{which had}} a brightness, though {{the light of the}} sun had left it and that of the stars had not come out. 'It is a lovely evening.' ...|$|E
60|$|Helen {{sank back}} upon her chair, {{perfectly}} helpless. This thing {{was too much}} for her to grasp. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> woman who had spoken these marvelous words, half frightened, altogether bewildered.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was going}} to write to you," [...] said Nan, as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> rector from under the wide brim of her hat. [...] "Our {{engagement}} is to be announced Wednesday." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Britling {{as if she}} {{measured}} his understanding.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} her grey eyes, humiliated and lonely.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him almost}} {{for the first}} time since her entrance.|$|R
60|$|She did {{not reply}} at once. Clarence Colfax got to his feet. Then <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> two men as they stood side by side, and perhaps swept them both in an instant's comparison.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> man, and as {{she looked}} her face grew gray and the thin sheet went quivering from her lifeless fingers to the floor. Then he began to laugh, and she knew.|$|E
60|$|It {{was truly}} Sylvia. She {{was dressed in}} white, not gray. Her hair was massed upon her head. There was no gray bonnet. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sky, then at the trees, and withdrew.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him shyly, {{yet with}} unmistakable love transfiguring her countenance.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} a little grimace and patted his hand.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} an {{expression}} of pleading in her eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> altered tone, and the {{expression}} of her face seemed to soften. But before she could make answer there was a rap at the door. It opened, and Brutus stood in the doorway.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{great many}} acorns are wasted, I suppose; {{but some of}} them sprout and grow, and make splendid trees," [...] added Merry, feeling more than she knew how to express, as <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> oaks overhead.|$|E
6000|$|She {{would not}} confess her {{consciousness}} of his meaning at once. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> clock, {{and then turned}} and pulled her father's watch out of his waistcoat pocket, and compared the time. [...] "Why, you're both fast!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, and answered, not him, but her own thoughts.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, {{and to his}} amazement {{her eyes}} were swimming.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him. He stood {{a shadowy}} {{presence}} beyond the light.|$|R
60|$|He {{paid the}} bill for the medicines, and they lifted her from the couch. Between them she walked slowly into the outer shop. Then she began to drag on their arms and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> chemist a little piteously.|$|E
60|$|Marguerite {{uttered a}} little cry of astonishment, at thus hearing her own {{familiar}} maiden name uttered {{so close to}} her. <b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stranger, and this time, with a cry of unfeigned pleasure, she put out both her hands effusively towards him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} how," [...] said Aurelia, [...] "but I know He will bear us through {{it as long as}} we trust Him and do nothing wrong," [...] and <b>she</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bright sky with hope and {{strength}} in her face.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> a {{sound and}} saw her father {{standing}} in the doorway.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, and {{a slight}} {{sinister}} smile contracted her white face.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, and he {{saw that}} her face was unusually pale.|$|R
