40|$|In {{photovoltaic}} (PV) power generation, partial shading is {{an unavoidable}} complication that significantly reduces {{the efficiency of}} the overall system. Under this condition, the PV system produces a multiple-peak function in its output power characteristic. Thus, a reliable technique is required to track the global maximum power point (GMPP) within an appropriate time. This study aims to employ a hybrid evolutionary algorithm called the DEPSO technique, a combination of the differential evolutionary (DE) algorithm and particle swarm optimization (PSO), to detect the maximum power point under partial <b>shading</b> <b>conditions.</b> The paper starts with a brief description about the behavior of PV systems under partial <b>shading</b> <b>conditions.</b> Then, the DEPSO technique along with its implementation in maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is explained in detail.

40|$|The {{photovoltaic}} (PV) array {{controlled by}} Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) method for optimum PV power generation, {{particularly when the}} PV array is under partially <b>shaded</b> <b>condition</b> is presented in this paper. The system modelling is carried out in MATLAB-SIMULINK where the PV array is formed by five series connected identical PV modules. Under uniform solar irradiance conditions, the PV module and the PV array present nonlinear P-V characteristic but the maximum power point (MPP) can be easily identified. However, when the PV array is under <b>shaded</b> <b>conditions,</b> the P-V characteristic becomes more complex with the present of multiple MPP. While the PV array operated at local MPP, the generated power is limited. Thus, the investigation on MPPT approach is carried out to maximize the PV generated power even when the PV array is under partially <b>shaded</b> <b>conditions</b> (PSC). Fuzzy logic is adopted into the conventional MPPT to form fuzzy logic based MPPT (FMPPT) for better performance. The developed MPPT and FMPPT are compared, particularly the performances on the transient response and the steady state response when the array is under various <b>shaded</b> <b>conditions.</b> FMPPT shows better performance where the simulation results demonstrate FMPPT is able to facilitate the PV array to reach the MPP faster while it helps the PV array to produce a more stable output power...|$|R

In fact, for an adequate prediction of temperature fields and the worst case shading scenario, spatially resolved information of the power dissipation on cell level and a thermal simulation of the module system are indispensable.

For these operating points we perform spatially resolved lock-in thermography measurements of the power dissipation on cell level. On that basis we compute three-dimensional temperature fields inside the module with a finite-element analysis for different realistic module operating conditions.

Conventional MPPT method give effective results and easy to perform under uniform irradiation condition.

Also, in these partially <b>shaded</b> <b>conditions,</b> series connection of PV modules gives lowest current in PV string. This reduces the output power of PV string. To achieve maximum output power, a converter is connected in parallel with each PV module provides the extra (equalization) current in parallel with the shaded module to make the string current equal to the maximum string current. The equalization current supports the PV module to have its voltage regulated at a value that corresponds to its MPP voltage. This technique is known as DMPPT (Distributed MPPT) method...|$|R

Building-integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) have acquired special interest due to their dual purpose of generating clean energy and act as a protective envelope for the building itself. Even though the BIPV market is expanding, there are challenges that these systems must face. Partial <b>shading</b> <b>conditions,</b> high operating temperatures, and mechanical loads during installation are non-ideal conditions that are difficult to avoid in BIPV systems. Thin-film technology in solar cells has become popular for BIPV applications due to its light weight and pleasing appearance. Thin-film manufacturers claim a better performance under <b>shading</b> <b>conditions</b> and high temperatures in comparison with conventional crystalline silicon technology; however, the reliability of this technology it is not certain. In this research project, crystalline silicon and thin-film photovoltaic modules were submit- ted to shading stress and high operating temperatures that simulate real conditions in order to compare their performance and reliability. Furthermore, response to physical stress typical during the installation of these panels was conducted. Higher performance under partial <b>shading</b> <b>conditions</b> was demonstrated for thin-film modules; however, the reverse bias caused by partial shading caused irreversible damage heat spots in the shaded areas.

40|$|Low solar {{radiation}} caused by industrial development and solar dimming {{has become a}} limitation in crop production in China. It is widely accepted that low {{solar radiation}} influences many aspects of plant development, including slender, weak stems and susceptibility to lodging. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. To clarify how low solar radiation affects stem mechanical strength formation and lodging resistance, the japonica rice cultivars Wuyunjing 23 (lodging-resistant) and W 3668 (lodging-susceptible) were grown under field conditions with normal light (Control) and shading (the incident light was reduced by 60 %) with a black nylon net. The yield and yield components, plant morphological characteristics, the stem mechanical strength, cell wall components, culm microstructure, gene expression correlated with cellulose and lignin biosynthesis were measured. The results showed that shading significantly reduced grain yield attributed to reduction of spikelets per panicles and grain weight. The stem-breaking strength decreased significantly under shading treatment; consequently, resulting in higher lodging index in rice plant in both varieties, as revealed by decreased by culm diameter, culm wall thickness and increased plant height, gravity center height. Compared with control, cell wall components including non-structural carbohydrate, sucrose, cellulose, and lignin reduced quite higher. With histochemical straining, shading largely reduced lignin deposition in the sclerenchyma cells and vascular bundle cells compared with control, and decreased cellulose deposition in the parenchyma cells of culm tissue in both Wuyunjing 23 and W 3668. And under <b>shading</b> <b>condition,</b> gene expression involved in secondary cell wall synthesis, OsPAL, OsCOMT, OsCCoAOMT, OsCCR, and OsCAD 2, and primary cell wall synthesis, OsCesA 1, OsCesA 3, and OsCesA 8 were decreased significantly. These results suggest that gene expression involved in the reduction of lignin and cellulose in both sclerenchyma and parenchyma cells, which attribute to lignin and cellulose in culm tissue and weak mechanical tissue, consequently, result in poor stem strength and higher lodging risks. Highlights:(1) Shading decreases the stem mechanical strength of japonica rice by decreasing non-structural carbohydrate, sucrose, lignin, and cellulose accumulation in culms. (2) The decrease of carbon source under <b>shading</b> <b>condition</b> is the cause for the lower lignin and cellulose accumulation in culm. (3) The expression of genes involved in lignin and primarily cell wall cellulose biosynthesis (OsCesA 1, OsCesA 3, and OsCesA 8) at the stem formation stage are down-regulated under <b>shading</b> <b>condition,</b> inducing defective cell wall development and poor lodging resistance...|$|E

Fourteen Vietnamese cultivars were covered by black cloth (50 % shading treatment) after the heading stage in the field conditions. Grain yield of fourteen Vietnamese cultivars in <b>shading</b> <b>condition</b> fell to about 32. 2 – 65. 0 % of the natural light condition. The most sensitive cultivars to shading are ‘Jasmine 85 ’ and ‘OM 2395 ’, of which the grain yield decreased to 65. 0 and 59. 8 % of natural light condition, respectively. The shaded yield decreased corresponding to the reduction in crop growth rate (CGR) and yield components, especially in the percentage of filled grain due to the increase in spikelet sterility. Shading increased the percentage of immature grains in all cultivars. Shading induced an increase in the percentage of chalky and green grains, which was largest in ‘OM 2517 ’ and ‘OM 5451 ’, respectively. Clearly, shading depressed both grain yield and the appearance quality of brown rice in Vietnamese cultivars, similarly reported in previous studies with Japanese cultivars. 　光強度は，水稲の生育・収量を決定する最も重要な環境要因である．しかし，光強度の減少，すなわち遮光処理がインド型水稲品種，特にベトナム産品種の生育・収量に及ぼす影響に関する知見は限られている．本研究では，登熟期間の遮光がベトナム産水稲品種の乾物生産，収量と収量構成要素，玄米の外観品質に及ぼす影響を 2015 年に調査した．ベトナム産水稲 14 品種を圃場栽培を行い，最初に出穂が認められた品種の出穂期以降収穫期まで，群落上層を黒色寒冷紗（遮光率 50 ）を用いて被覆する，遮光処理を行った．ベトナム産 14 品種の収量は，遮光に伴い自然光条件に比較して 32. 2 ～ 65. 0 の低下がみられた．遮光処理の影響が大きかった品種は‘Jasmine 85 ’ と‘OM 2395 ’ で，それぞれ 65. 0 ， 59. 8 の収量低下がみられた．収量の低下には，登熟期の個体群成長速度，収量構成要素では穎花不稔の増加による登熟歩合の低下に起因していた．遮光処理はすべての品種で玄米の未熟粒割合を増加させた．遮光処理により，白未熟粒と青未熟粒の増加がみられ，その程度は白未熟粒が‘OM 2517 ’ で，青未熟粒が‘OM 5415 ’ で最も著しかった．以上の結果，遮光処理はベトナム産水稲 14 品種の収量と玄米の外観品質を低下させたが，その程度には品種間差があることが明らかになり，これらの傾向は日本産水稲品種で得られた結果と同様であった...|$|E
