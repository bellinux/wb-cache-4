The Viking program, which visited Mars in the late 1970s, was motivated in part to determine whether Mars supported life, and many of the sensors and experiments that were ultimately deployed aimed to resolve this issue. During work on a precursor of this program, Lovelock became interested in the composition of the Martian atmosphere, reasoning that many life forms on Mars would be obliged to make use of it (and, thus, alter it). However, the atmosphere was found to be in a stable condition close to its chemical equilibrium, with very little oxygen, methane, or hydrogen, but with an overwhelming abundance of carbon dioxide. To Lovelock, the stark contrast between the Martian atmosphere and chemically dynamic mixture of that of the Earth's biosphere was strongly indicative of the absence of life on the planet. However, when they were finally launched to Mars, the Viking probes still searched (unsuccessfully) for extant life there.Lovelock invented the electron capture detector, which ultimately assisted in discoveries about the persistence of CFCs and their role in stratospheric ozone depletion.

We assume that the surfaces and atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets (Earth-like and super-Earths) will most often be dominated by a specific geochemical cycle. Here we concentrate on the <b>sulphur</b> <b>cycle</b> driven by outgassing of SO 2 and H 2 S followed by their transformation to other sulphur-bearing species which is clearly distinguishable from the carbon cycle which is driven by outgassing of CO 2.

Wet-laboratory experimental research shows that epsilon-proteobacteria Sulfurimonas denitrificans possess sox (sulphur-oxidizing) operon and perform thiosulphate oxidation efficiently underneath the oceans. From this specific sox operon, SoxCD complex recycles the thiosulphate-bound SoxY from SoxYZ complex to balance the environmental <b>sulphur</b> <b>cycle.</b> So, four chief proteins were variedly modeled and relevant simulated interactive structures were obtained.

The stability of the complex (SoxYZCD) after simulation was also observed through the electrostatic surface potential values. These evaluations were rationalized via biostatistics.

40|$|The first {{technical}} {{developments on}} thermochemical cycles for hydrogen production {{are based on}} the use of sulphur as a redox material. After the oil crises of the 1970 s, high temperature (over 1200 K) heat from nuclear very high temperature reactors (VHTRs) was considered as a promising energy vector to produce fuels for the transport sector. The chemical reactions to convert water into hydrogen must fit to this heat source. As metal-oxide based cycles need higher temperature levels they were not taken into account at that time. The development of the <b>sulphur</b> <b>cycles</b> lost momentum during the 1980 s because of cheap fossil fuels. But {{in the beginning of the}} 2000 s they came back into the focus with the intention to reduce CO 2 emissions. At that time their coupling to heat from concentrated solar radiation in large scale was developed. The interest from the nuclear energy side faded again when the interest in VHTRs lost momentum. In parallel concentrated solar technologies were not implemented fast enough. The developments were mainly achieved by research institutions that concentrated more on the metal-oxide technologies. However, <b>sulphur</b> based <b>cycles</b> remain very promising because the necessary temperature is low compared to metal-oxide <b>cycles</b> and <b>sulphur</b> and sulphuric acid are amongst the most important chemical products offering a high potential of synergies with other processes.

40|$|A {{study of}} an International Continental Drilling Program core {{recovered}} {{from the middle of}} the modern Dead Sea has identified microbial traces within this subsurface hypersaline environment. A comparison with an active microbial mat exhibiting similar evaporative processes characterized iron-sulphur mineralization and exopolymeric substances resulting from microbial activity. Exopolymeric substances were identified in the drilled sediment but unlike other hypersaline environments, it appears that they have a limited effect on the precipitation of calcium carbonate in the sedimentary column. Sulphate reduction, however, plays a role in all types of evaporative facies, leading to the formation of diagenetic iron sulphides in glacial and interglacial intervals. Their synthesis seems to occur under progressive sulphidation that generally stops at greigite because of incomplete sulphate reduction. The latter may be caused by a lack of suitable organic matter in this hypersaline, hence energy-demanding, environment. Pyrite may be found in periods of high lake productivity, when more labile organic matter is available.

Comparative analysis of populations associated with ALWC layers and NLWC (Normal Low Water Corrosion) layers evidenced clear differences in the structure and composition of the communities. Dominant phylotypes related to sulphate-reducing bacteria pertaining to Desulfobacteraceae, Desulfobulbaceae and Desulfovibrionaceae were identified in both type of deposits (fraction of 52 % and 44 % of the total NLWC and ALWC communities, respectively). Phylotypes related to sulphur-oxidizing bacteria belonging to Alpha-, Gamma- and Epsilonproteobacteria were unique to ALWC deposits, while phylotypes related to oxygenic photosynthetic microorganisms (cyanobacteria, diatoms) were only retrieved in NLWC deposits. This suggested that biologically-mediated <b>sulphur</b> <b>cycle</b> was the dominant process within ALWC deposits vs. chemically-mediated <b>sulphur</b> <b>cycle</b> within NLWC deposits.

The vertical distribution of electron donors and acceptors in the chemically stratified water column may be responsible for the stratified distribution of microbial populations, suggesting well-defined functional specialization. The highest microbial richness was detected in the anoxic zone, which hosted high percentages of bacterial sequences related to uncultured and poorly described phyla. This suggests an under-representation of anoxic environments in current databases and the presence of previously undescribed taxa. Microbial diversity is made up of 2 fractions: abundant species (e. g. Galand et al. 2009) and rare species. Abundant species were more stable than rare species over time.

40|$|The Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) mass {{extinction}} event occurred 66 million years ago, {{the most recent}} of the ‘Big Five’ extinction crises of the last 540 million years. This event {{had a profound effect}} on both life and the broader Earth system, with the extinction of up to 75 % of life. Despite years of detailed research, debate continues as to the nature and timing of the extinction. Ideas for an abrupt crisis, triggered by bolide impact at Chicxulub in the Gulf of Mexico, contrast with those suggesting a more gradual extinction, involving volcanism from the Deccan Traps Large Igneous Province in India and/or climatic changes. Evidence from the high latitudes has been used to suggest that the fossil record from Antarctica is incompatible with models for a single, sudden event, and that extinction intensity declined at high latitudes. This thesis presents a detailed study of extensive fossil and sediment collections from the highest southern latitude onshore outcrop containing the K–Pg transition; the highly expanded and fossiliferous López de Bertodano Formation of Seymour Island, James Ross Basin, located at 65 °S today, and during the Cretaceous. New biostratigraphic and diversity data for the molluscan (bivalves, gastropods, cephalopods) faunas of the López de Bertodano Formation, and geochemical datasets (seawater sulphur and pyrite sulphur isotopes) are compared to published records, and evidence for palaeoenvironmental change. They suggest a single, rapid extinction event coincident with the K–Pg boundary, with no precursor decline. The magnitude of the extinction in Antarctica is also consistent with lower latitudes, suggestive of a global, catastrophic trigger for the K–Pg extinction, such as bolide impact. Sulphur isotope data suggest the K–Pg <b>sulphur</b> <b>cycle</b> was able to respond to rapid environmental changes before, and after the K–Pg {{mass extinction}}.

40|$|Oxygenation of the Earth's {{surface is}} {{increasingly}} {{thought to have}} occurred in two steps. The first step, which occurred ~ 2, 300 million years (Myr) ago, involved {{a significant increase in}} atmospheric oxygen concentrations and oxygenation of the surface ocean. A further increase in atmospheric oxygen appears to have taken place during the late Neoproterozoic period (~ 800 – 542 Myr ago). This increase may have stimulated the evolution of macroscopic multicellular animals and the subsequent radiation of calcified invertebrates, and may have led to oxygenation of the deep ocean. However, the nature and timing of Neoproterozoic oxidation remain uncertain. Here we present high-resolution carbon isotope and sulphur isotope records from the Huqf Supergroup, Sultanate of Oman, that cover most of the Ediacaran period (~ 635 to ~ 548 Myr ago). These records indicate that the ocean became increasingly oxygenated {{after the end of the}} Marinoan glaciation, and they allow us to identify three distinct stages of oxidation. When considered in the context of other records from this period, our data indicate that certain groups of eukaryotic organisms appeared and diversified during the second and third stages of oxygenation. The second stage corresponds with the Shuram excursion in the carbon isotope record and seems to have involved the oxidation of a large reservoir of organic carbon suspended in the deep ocean, indicating that this event may have had a key role in the evolution of eukaryotic organisms. Our data thus provide new insights into the oxygenation of the Ediacaran ocean and the stepwise restructuring of the carbon and <b>sulphur</b> <b>cycles</b> that occurred during this significant period of Earth's history...|$|R
40|$|The geochemical {{cycles of}} iron and sulphur in marine sediments are {{strongly}} intertwined and {{give rise to a}} complex network of redox and precipitation reactions. Bioturbation refers to all modes of transport of particles and solutes induced by larger organisms, and in the present-day seafloor, bioturbation {{is one of the most}} important factors controlling the biogeochemical cycling {{of iron and}} sulphur. To better understand how bioturbation controls Fe and S cycling, we developed reactive transport model of a coastal sediment impacted by faunal activity. Subsequently, we performed a model sensitivity analysis, separately investigating the two different transport modes of bioturbation, i. e. bio-mixing (solid particle transport) and bio-irrigation (enhanced solute transport). This analysis reveals that bio-mixing and bio-irrigation have distinct—and largely opposing effects on both the iron and <b>sulphur</b> <b>cycles.</b> Bio-mixing enhances transport between the oxic and suboxic zones, thus promoting the reduction of oxidised species (e. g. iron oxyhydroxides) and the oxidation of reduced species (e. g. iron sulphides). Through the re-oxidation of iron sulphides, bio-mixing strongly enhances the recycling of Fe and S between their reduced and oxidised states. Bio-irrigation on the other hand removes reduced solutes, i. e. ferrous iron and free sulphide, from the sediment pore water. These reduced species are then reoxidised in the overlying water and not recycled within the sediment column, which leads to a decrease in Fe and S recycling. Overall, our results demonstrate that the ecology of the macrofauna (inducing bio-mixing or bio-irrigation, or both) matters when assessing their impact on sediment geochemistry. This finding seems particularly relevant for sedimentary cycling across Cambrian transition, when benthic fauna started colonizing and reworking the seafloor...|$|R

Firstly, the sedimentation of massive evaporite deposits is discussed and its relationship with the Early Aptian OAE 1 a explored. The proposed coincidence in timing between massive evaporite deposition and OAE 1 a enhances the understanding of carbon and <b>sulphur</b> <b>cycles</b> in the Early Cretaceous. Secondly, the top of sub-evaporite carbonates in the southern Brazilian basins is identified as having been deposited in a continental environment, and further evidence for its deposition during part of the OAE 1 a interval is presented. Thirdly, it is suggested that the formation of the Ontong Java Plateau, already linked to the genesis of OAE 1 a, promoted a eustatic sealevel rise responsible for rapid seawater entrance into the southern Brazilian basins during the Early Aptian. Fourthly, the first record of OAE 1 a from northeastern Brazil (Sergipe- Alagoas Basin) has been recognized, allowing stratigraphic correlation with southern Brazilian basins. Stratigraphic correlation between the southern Brazilian basins is extended to the Falkland Plateau, where the decrease in the content of organic matter upwards in the stratigraphy of DSDP Site 511 through the BarremianâOAE 1 b interval can be related to the evolution of South Atlantic basinal geometry.

The Hybrid <b>Sulphur</b> <b>Cycle</b> (HyS) consisting of two reaction steps [1] is considered {{as one of the}} most promising cycles: Firstly, sulphuric acid is decomposed by high temperature heat of 800 - 1200 °C forming sulphur dioxide (SO 2), which in a second step is used to electrochemically split water. Compared to conventional water electrolysis only about a tenth of the theoretical voltage is required making the HyS one of the most efficient processes to produce hydrogen by concentrated solar radiation [2]. As a result, this thermochemical cycle has the potential to significantly reduce the amount of energy required for water splitting and to efficiently generate hydrogen free of carbon dioxide emissions. The European research project HycycleS (Materials and components for Hydrogen production by sulphur based thermochemical cycles) [4] aims at a technical realisation of the Hybrid <b>Sulphur</b> <b>Cycle.</b> One objective of the project is to develop and qualify a solar interface, meaning a device to couple concentrated solar radiation into the endothermal steps of the chemical process. Therefore a test reactor for decomposition of sulphuric acid by concentrated solar radiation was developed and tested in the solar furnace of DLR in Cologne. Based on the preceding project HYTHEC (HYdrogen THErmochemical Cycles) [3] an optimised reactor concept with two chambers was constructed [5]: In th...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{review is}} {{concerned}} with the technique of stable isotope analyses (d 34 S‰) as a means of studying the <b>sulphur</b> <b>cycle</b> with particular emphasis on the formation of sulphate evaporites such as gypsum (CaSO 4. 2 H 2 O). Gypsum is found in all settings that promote evaporation, including hot and cold desert environments. The technique of sulphur isotopic analysis lends itself to constraining the primary sources of sulphur as well as associated pathways of sulphur dispersal, which lead to the formation of sulphate. The review features gypsum in caves, salt pans and limestone walls with sulphur sources ranging from the marine environment to bedrock...|$|E

Phosphate solubilizing microbes {{play an important role in}} plant nutrition through increase in phosphate uptake by plants and used as biofertilizers for agricultural crops. Phosphate is one of the most vital macronutrient required for the growth and development of plants. A large number of microorganisms present in the rhizosphere are known to solubilize and mak...|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this study it will be shown in a market {{research}} that for hydrogen from nuclear water splitting in chemical as well as in energetic use till the year 2025, significant consumption potentials can be opened. Methods for capital cost estimation under small A-priori information of process specification are tested with regard of applicability to thermochemical and hybrid hydrogen production cycles and of attainable precisions. For three <b>sulphur</b> family <b>cycles,</b> the H$_{ 2 }$SO$_{ 4 }$- and HBr-hybrid cycle and the CH$_{ 4 }$ - CH$_{ 3 }$OH pure thermochemical cycle, capital costs and chemical engineering problems are discussed. For two recently proposed cycles, an electrolysis in fused sodium hydroxide and the Li/LiH hybrid process, investment and hydrogen production costs are estimated. In a concluding competition analysis production costs of hydrogen from water splitting will be compared with H$_{ 2 }$ from Methan Steam Reforming, SNG from nuclear hard coal gasification, fuel oil and natural gas with aspect to dates of economic substitution...|$|R
