40|$|Sandwich {{placements}} {{and other}} integrated work and study schemes are increasingly advocated {{as a key}} means by which universities can promote students' employability. However, there is little understanding of how <b>successful</b> <b>placements</b> work in terms of facilitating learning and development. Drawing on three longitudinal case studies of students who have undertaken placements, two successfully, we use Bourdieu's conceptions of habitus and field to theorise <b>successful</b> <b>placements.</b> We establish {{the importance of the}} initial ‘fit’ between an individual's habitus and the field they enter to undertake a sandwich placement, together with the extent of the ‘horizon for learning’ emerging through the continuing interaction of habitus and field. Further, we argue that this relational approach can help us to recognise the importance of non-cognitive aspects of informal learning through placements and to understand how <b>successful</b> <b>placements</b> can be the catalyst for better grades on return to university study...|$|R

50|$|The route {{would not}} come to pass, however. A few weeks after a <b>successful</b> <b>placement</b> in the 1927 National Air Races, Yackey was {{finishing}} up testing on the winning plane before it was transferred to its new owner, Ed Campbell, who was a passenger on the cross-country race. Yackey was a noted advocate for airline safety, and insisted on personally testing every plane he built before final sale. On October 4, 1927 Yackey took the plane out for one more rigorous test flight over the air fields, despite it having been tested and proven in service. According to mechanic Henry Johnson, a noted weakness in the right wing prompted him to install a new iron bracing for support. In mid-flight, this bracing failed, causing the wing to buckle during a steep turn. Yackey immediately {{lost control of the}} plane, plunging him 500 feet from the air into the ground, where the plane exploded. Newspaper reports from around the Midwest described Yackey's death in gruesome detail, that his body was crushed and then burned beyond recognition in the wreckage. The noise of the airplane breaking up in mid-air alerted local firefighters, who observed the plane come down.|$|E

5000|$|On July 23, 2015, V.C. Summer Unit 2 {{reached a}} {{landmark}} milestone with the <b>successful</b> <b>placement</b> of the CA-01 module, {{one of the}} largest, heaviest, and most complicated modules within the Nuclear Island, {{also referred to as}} a super module because it was so large that huge submodules had to be shipped from the manufacturer and final assembly was completed on site in the twelve-story Module Assembly Building. Installation of CA-01 was long delayed due to both regulatory and production hurdles related to the module. It is the first of the US AP1000 reactors under construction to achieve placement of this critical module, beating Vogtle Unit 3 to this milestone, and allowing other construction activities in the Nuclear Island to progress that could not proceed until the module was in place. CA-01 is a large structural module that forms the internal structures of some compartments within the Containment Vessel, including the Steam Generator compartments, Reactor Vessel cavity, and Refueling Canal. The CA-01 Module is the heaviest module on site, weighing 1,200 tons, or 2.4 million pounds. Because of how much it weighs, lifting and placing the CA-01 module into the Unit 2 Nuclear Island resulted in the heaviest lift for the V.C. Summer construction project to date.|$|E
5000|$|Trochleitis is {{diagnosed}} based on three criteria: 1) demonstration of inflammation of superior oblique tendon/ trochlea region, 2) periorbital pain and tenderness to palpation {{in the area}} of the sore trochlea, and 3) worsening of pain on attempted vertical eye movement, particularly with adduction of the eye. It is important to identify trochleitis because it is a treatable condition and the patient can benefit much from pain relief. Treatment consists of a single injection of corticosteroids to the affected peritrochlear region. A specific [...] "cocktail" [...] consisting of 0.5 ml of depomedrol (80 mg/ml) and 0.5 ml of 2% lidocaine can be injected into the trochlea; immediate relief due to the effects of the local anesthetic indicates <b>successful</b> <b>placement.</b> However, great care must be taken as the injection is in the region of several arteries, veins and nerves. The needle should not be too small (so as not to penetrate tiny structures), the surgeon should draw back on the syringe (to ensure not have pierced a vessel), the lidocaine should not contain epinephrine (which could cause vasospasm), and the pressure of the injection must always be controlled. Only a limited number of injections can be made as they would otherwise lead to muscle atrophy. Diagnosis can be confirmed by response to this treatment; pain and swelling are expected to disappear in 48-72 hours. Some patients experience recurrence of trochleitis.|$|E

I say to you, therefore, your duty is twofold. I am glad to see such magnificent material for soldiers around me, and I say to you: [...] "Go on drilling and make yourself efficient for the Work, and then account yourselves as men, not only for Ireland itself, but wherever the fighting line extends, in defence of right, of freedom, and religion in this war".|$|E
30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of menstrual phase and preoperative hormonal contraception on <b>successful</b> bilateral <b>placement</b> of the Essure micro-insert tubal coil.

The main outcome measure was the <b>successful</b> bilateral <b>placement</b> of the Essure micro-insert tubal coil defined as bilateral visualization of the tubal ostia and cannulation with the Essure micro-insert coil. Eighty-one of 84 patients (96 %) had successful visualization of the tubal ostia with bilateral placement achieved in 78 / 81 (96 %).

5000|$|A nasopharyngeal airway is a {{soft rubber}} or plastic tube that is {{passed through the}} nose and into the {{posterior}} pharynx. Nasopharyngeal airways are produced in various lengths and diameters to accommodate for gender and anatomical variations. Functionally, the device is gently inserted through a patient's nose after careful lubrication with a viscous lidocaine gel. <b>Successful</b> <b>placement</b> will facilitate spontaneous ventilation, masked ventilation, or machine assisted ventilation with a modified nasopharyngeal airway designed with special attachments at the proximal end. Patients generally tolerate NPAs very well. NPAs are preferred over OPAs when the patient's jaw is clenched or if the patient is semiconscious and cannot tolerate an OPA. NPAs, however, are generally not recommended if there is suspicion of a fracture {{to the base of}} the skull. In these circumstances, insertion of the NPA can cause neurological damage by entering the cranium during placement. There is no consensus, however, regarding the risk of neurological damage secondary to a basilar skull fracture compared to hypoxia due to insufficient airway management. Other complications of Nasopharyngeal airways use includes laryngospasm, epistaxis, vomiting, and tissue necrosis with prolonged use.Oropharyngeal airways are curved, rigid plastic devices, inserted into the patient's mouth. Oropharyngeal airways are produced in various lengths and diameters to accommodate for gender and anatomical variations. It is especially useful in patients with excessive tongue and other soft tissues. OPAs prevent airway obstruction by ensuring that the patient's tongue does not obstruct the epiglottis by creating a conduit. Because an oropharyngeal airway can mechanically stimulate the gag reflex, it should only be used in a deeply sedated or unresponsive patient to avoid vomiting and aspiration [...] Careful attention must be made while inserting an OPA. The user must avoid pushing the tongue further down the patient's throat. This is usually done by inserting the OPA with its curve facing cephalad and rotating it 180 degrees as you enter the posterior pharynx.|$|E
