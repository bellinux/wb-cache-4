40|$|Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) is an {{emerging}} technology for radio frequency (RF) systems {{because it has}} the potential to dramatically decrease loss and improve efficiency. In this paper, we address the design and fabrication of novel MEMS switches being developed at NASA Glenn Research Center. Two types of switches are being developed: a microstrip series <b>single</b> pole <b>single</b> <b>throw</b> (SPST) <b>switch</b> and a coplanar waveguide (CPW) series SPST and <b>single</b> pole double <b>throw</b> (SPDT) <b>switches.</b> These are being fabricated as an integral part of 50 Ohm microstrip and CPW RF integrated circuits using microfabrication techniques. The construction of the switch relies on a cantilever beam that is partially supported by a dielectric post. The cantilever beam is electro-magnetically actuated. To decrease stiction, a Si 3 N 4 thin film is deposited over the contact area. Thus, when the switch is closed, the ON-state insertion loss is governed by the parallel plate capacitance formed by the two contacts. The isolation in the OFF-state is governed by the parasitic capacitance when the cantilever is in the up position. RF MEMS switches have been demonstrated with 80 % lower insertion loss than conventional solid state devices (GaAs Metal Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors (MESFETs) and Silicon PIN diodes) based switches. For example, a conventional GaAs five-bit phase shifter which is required for beam steering in a phased array antenna has approximately 7 dB of insertion loss at 26. 5 GHz where as a comparable MEMS based phase shifter is expected to have only 2 dB of insertion loss. This translates into 56 % lower power dissipation and therefore decreases the thermal load on the spacecraft and also reduces the power amplifier requirements. These benefits will enable NASA to build the next generation of deep space science crafts and micro/nano satellites...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a solution for}} battery-less power management circuits for micro-power energy converters, allowing energy harvesting systems to operate under continuous and intermittent conditions. The proposed trigger circuit is a fully passive, normally open, <b>single</b> pole, <b>single</b> <b>throw,</b> analog <b>switch</b> driven by a nano-power CMOS control unit. The trigger circuit starts in an OPEN state until the voltage, at its input terminal, reaches a high threshold, when it toggles to the CLOSED state. Once the input voltage drops below a low threshold, the trigger circuit returns to the OPEN state. In the CLOSED state, the trigger circuit creates a low resistance path between the input and output terminals, while at the OPEN state the input is isolated from the output. A first prototype was breadboarded by using discrete components {{for the sake of}} performance evaluation. Low threshold voltages (2. 15 V and 1. 15 V), sub-ohm CLOSED-state resistance, and power consumption requirements (in the order of 55. 9 and 167. 7 nW), coupled with relatively high energy extraction capabilities are confirmed by experimental results. These features put our proposed circuit among the best {{of its kind in the}} state-of-the-art circuits.

40|$|There is an {{increased}} demand on {{efficient use of}} frequency spectrum required by the modern wireless communication systems. As we are facing an explosion of information data transmission, that is estimated to grow exponentially {{in the next few}} years, multiband and ultrawideband systems are the realistic solutions to follow. As a result, reconfigurable systems are of significant importance and are investigated in numerous research centers. In this thesis, novel designs based on radio frequency micro-electro-mechanical systems (RF MEMS) that can lead to the reconfigurable wireless transceivers are proposed. Different RF MEMS approaches were investigated. Electrostatic RF MEMS were selected as the base of all our designs due to the important factors such as low power consumption and small physical sizes and volumes. Several RF MEMS devices were designed, simulated, fabricated and measured. These include single-pole <b>single</b> <b>throw</b> <b>switches,</b> multiport switches and switch matrices. Special structures such as scalable matrices and reconfigurable filter have also been designed and implemented. &# 149; Several electrostatically actuated RF MEMS switches were designed, modeled, simulated and fabricated. Major problems such as high actuation and low fabrication yield due to residue stress in RF MEMS were investigated and tackled. A new simplified closed form model to analytically calculate spring constant of laterally meandered beam is introduced. A methodology is demonstrated to show reduction of directional stress sensitivity by introducing inline dimple lines. A numerical approach on calculating the spring constant of a vertically corrugated beam is shown. The designed RF MEMS switches achieved good RF performance concomitant with good mechanical characteristics. All switches developed achieved wideband operation from DC to 40 GHz with less than 0. 7 dB insertion loss and 20 dB return loss. &# 149; An RF MEMS T-type switch for redundancy switch matrix applications is introduced for the first time. The T-type switch is capable of performing all the operations as from other technologies. Novel RF circuits were designed to be used for the implementation in the switch. These include: RF crossover, 90 degree turns and four-port cross junctions. The T-type switch measured RF performance that outmatches all existing technologies. The measured results for the entire T-type switch demonstrate an insertion loss of 1. 5 dB, a return loss of better than 20 dB and isolation higher than 28 dB for all states for frequencies up to 30 GHz. To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} an RF MEMS T-type switch has ever been reported. &# 149; New solutions for implementing wideband large switch matrices were demonstrated. These solutions are based on crossbar and L-shaped matrix topologies. Unit cell design approaches were taking into consideration to achieve scalability in the matrix order and enhancement on RF performance. A 3 × 3 crossbar and a 4 × 4 L-shaped switch matrix were designed as prove of concepts. Both designs achieved ultrawideband performance. The devices can operate up to 40 GHz without much RF performance compensations. We have reduced up to 98 % overall device size compared to some previous RF switch matrices. To authors&# 146; knowledge, this is the first time RF MEMS crossbar and L-shaped matrices ever reported. &# 149; Novel RF MEMS reconfigurable bandpass filter was introduced. New method to adjust both the resonant frequency and the input/output and inter-resonator coupling simultaneously using one set of RF MEMS switches is presented. A three-pole switchable filter with three different states was designed as an example. The measured center frequency of the filter for each state is 8, 9. 3, and 10. 53 GHz (20 % tuning) with a constant bandwidth of around 1 GHz.

In this dissertation, several new structural designs are proposed, which provide solutions for some crucial RF blocks in CMOS for UWB for commercial applications. In this dissertation, there is a discussion of the development, as well as an illustration, of a fully-integrated ultra-broadband transmit/receive (T/R) switch which uses nMOS transistors with deep n-well in a standard 0. 18 -?m CMOS process. The new CMOS T/R switch exploits patterned-ground-shield on-chip inductors together with MOSFET?s parasitic capacitances in order to synthesize artificial transmission lines which result in low insertion loss over an extremely wide bandwidth. Within DC- 10 GHz, 10 - 18 GHz, and 18 - 20 GHz, the developed CMOS T/R switch exhibits insertion loss of less than 0. 7, 1. 0 and 2. 5 dB and isolation between 32 - 60 dB, 25 - 32 dB, and 25 - 27 dB, respectively. The measured 1 -dB power compression point and input third-order intercept point reach as high as 26. 2 and 41 dBm, respectively.
