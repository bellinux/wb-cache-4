5|$|Sorabji's fugues, {{the most}} atonal of his works, {{generally}} follow traditional methods. After a subject and {{between one and}} four countersubjects have been presented in an exposition, there follows a development section in which the subject (and countersubjects, particularly in the earlier fugues) are usually developed in their original form and in inversion, retrograde and retrograde inversion. The movement continues with a stretto and concludes with a section featuring augmentation and a thickening of lines into chords. His multi-subject fugues repeat this pattern for each subject, and combine thematic material from all expositions in the last section. The fugues are more conservative than most of his output, in that they rarely use polyrhythms. They can contain up to six subjects, and it is these that mark Sorabji's fugues as different from most others. Some of the <b>subjects</b> <b>are</b> among his most unconventional melodic creations, lacking the frequent changes of direction that characterise most melodies; other <b>subjects</b> <b>are</b> possibly the longest ever conceived. This has led some people either to treat them with suspicion or to criticise them.|$|E

5|$|As sensor coils {{are placed}} on the tongue of the subject, {{articulation}} may be affected depending on {{the placement of the}} coils, but no comparative analysis has shown whether articulation is altered because of the coils. The coils are about 3mm in size and are not considered to be a particularly large source of error for measurements. Some researchers have found that <b>subjects</b> <b>are</b> irritated by sensor coils placed on the tip of the tongue which can lead to disturbed articulation. Similarly, the wires attached to the sensor coils can inhibit articulation if not run out the side of the mouth.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of vegetation, the earth does not yet contain human or animal life, indicating that the scene represents {{the events of the}} biblical Third Day. Bosch renders the plant life in an unusual fashion, using uniformly gray tints which make it difficult to determine whether the <b>subjects</b> <b>are</b> purely vegetable or perhaps include some mineral formations. Surrounding the interior of the globe is the sea, partially illuminated by beams of light shining through clouds. The exterior wings have a clear position within the sequential narrative of the work as a whole.

5|$|Greenlandic is an ergative language. This means that, {{instead of}} {{treating}} the grammatical relations {{as in most}} European languages where grammatical <b>subjects</b> <b>are</b> marked with nominative case and objects with accusative, the grammatical roles are defined differently. In Greenlandic the ergative case is used for agents of transitive verbs and for possessors. Absolutive case is used for patients of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs. Research into Greenlandic as used by the younger generation {{has shown that the}} use of ergative alignment in Kalaallisut may be becoming obsolete, converting the language into a nominative–accusative language.|$|E
5|$|Having {{published}} many novels, {{essays and}} short stories, Narayan {{is credited with}} bringing Indian writing {{to the rest of}} the world. While he has been regarded as one of India's greatest writers of the twentieth century, critics have also described his writings with adjectives such as charming, harmless and benign. Narayan has also come in for criticism from later writers, particularly of Indian origin, who have classed his writings as having a pedestrian style with a shallow vocabulary and a narrow vision. According to Shashi Tharoor, Narayan's <b>subjects</b> <b>are</b> similar to those of Jane Austen as they both deal with a very small section of society. However, he adds that while Austen's prose was able to take those subjects beyond ordinariness, Narayan's was not. A similar opinion is held by Shashi Deshpande who characterizes Narayan's writings as pedestrian and naive because of the simplicity of his language and diction, combined with the lack of any complexity in the emotions and behaviours of his characters.|$|E

5|$|The Reformation brought {{changes in}} outlook and artistic {{expression}} as secular and landscape imagery overtook biblical scenes. Sacred imagery {{was shown in}} a didactic and moralistic manner, with religious figures becoming marginalized and relegated to the background. Pieter Bruegel the Elder, {{one of the few}} who followed Bosch's style, is an important bridge between the Early Netherlandish artists and their successors. His work retains many 15th-century conventions, but his perspective and <b>subjects</b> <b>are</b> distinctly modern. Sweeping landscapes came to the fore in paintings that were provisionally religious or mythological, and his genre scenes were complex, with overtones of religious skepticism and even hints of nationalism.|$|E
5|$|Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion {{is a key}} {{precursor}} to Bacon's later work, and he sustained its formal and thematic preoccupations throughout his career. The triptych format, the placement of figures behind glass in heavily gilded frames, the open mouth, the use of painterly distortion, the Furies, and {{the theme of the}} Crucifixion were all to reappear in later works. Bacon's principal mode of expression is introduced: the <b>subjects</b> <b>are</b> anatomically and physically distorted, and the mood is violent, foreboding, and relentlessly physical. In other respects the triptych stands apart from other paintings in his oeuvre. It refers directly to its inspirations, and interprets the source material in an uncharacteristically literal manner. The triptych is further distinct in that its creatures are located in an outside space; by 1948, Bacon's studies of heads and figures specifically emphasised their confinement in rooms or other closed spaces.|$|E

5|$|Unlike diethyl ether, {{methoxyflurane}} is {{a significant}} respiratory depressant. In dogs, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in respiratory rate and a marked decrease in respiratory minute volume, with a relatively mild decrease in tidal volume. In humans, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in tidal volume and minute volume, with respiratory rate relatively constant.

When Lee reports this to Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) in the prime universe, she suddenly recalls her Cortexiphan trials including fellow subject Nick Lane, and with the team's help, identifies that other Cortexiphan <b>subjects</b> <b>are</b> the epicenter of these quakes, linking to their parallel universe versions to achieve synchronization.|$|E
5|$|Surviving Macedonian painted artwork {{includes}} frescoes and murals, {{but also}} decoration on sculpted artwork such as statues and reliefs. For instance, trace colors still {{exist on the}} bas-reliefs of the late 4th-century BC Alexander Sarcophagus. Macedonian paintings have allowed historians to investigate the clothing fashions as well as military gear worn by the ancient Macedonians. Aside from metalwork and painting, mosaics are another significant form of surviving Macedonian artwork. The Stag Hunt Mosaic of Pella, with its three-dimensional qualities and illusionist style, show clear influence from painted artwork and wider Hellenistic art trends, although the rustic theme of hunting was tailored to Macedonian tastes. The similar Lion Hunt Mosaic of Pella illustrates either a scene of Alexander the Great with his companion Craterus, or simply a conventional illustration of the royal diversion of hunting. Mosaics with mythological themes include scenes of Dionysus riding a panther and Helen of Troy being abducted by Theseus, the latter of which employs illusionist qualities and realistic shading similar to Macedonian paintings. Common themes of Macedonian paintings and mosaics include warfare, hunting, and aggressive masculine sexuality (i.e. abduction of women for rape or marriage); these <b>subjects</b> <b>are</b> at times combined within a single work and perhaps indicate a metaphorical connection.|$|E
30|$|By {{analyzing}} {{the results in}} Tables 1, 2, and 3, it can be observed that the proposed algorithm performs {{at a level that}} is rather close to that of human subjects.

Similarly, for width values, the average correlation among human <b>subjects</b> <b>is</b> 0.89, whereas the correlation of the proposed algorithm to human <b>subjects</b> <b>is</b> 0.95.

5|$|While English is a subject-prominent language, at the {{discourse}} level {{it tends to}} use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally {{has to be the}} grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by a bee. Dummy <b>subjects</b> <b>are</b> also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.|$|E
