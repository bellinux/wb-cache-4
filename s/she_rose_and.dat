60|$|<b>She</b> <b>rose</b> <b>and</b> went, feeling rather {{angry with}} herself for going.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>rose</b> <b>and</b> {{shook her}} head--without giving him back the vase, however.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>rose</b> <b>and,</b> {{crossing}} the room, {{opened the door}} into the bar.|$|E
60|$|She {{thought he}} was raving. <b>She</b> <b>rose,</b> bewildered <b>and</b> frightened.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>rose</b> reluctantly, <b>and</b> resumed {{her place}} {{in front of her}} desk.|$|R
60|$|Instead of {{answering}} him, <b>she</b> <b>rose</b> abruptly, <b>and</b> {{hurried to the}} door.|$|R
60|$|The {{movement}} {{deserved a}} better success. <b>She</b> <b>rose,</b> <b>and</b> they all followed her.|$|E
60|$|A {{flood of}} light filled Mildred's eyes as <b>she</b> <b>rose</b> <b>and</b> confronted him.|$|E
60|$|Her {{face seemed}} to darken as <b>she</b> <b>rose</b> <b>and</b> moved towards the door.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} the girl's cheek flamed, then <b>she</b> <b>rose</b> quietly <b>and</b> crossed the room.|$|R
60|$|In a few moments, {{the frenzy}} fit seemed to pass off; <b>she</b> <b>rose</b> slowly, <b>and</b> seemed to collect herself.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>rose,</b> too, <b>and</b> {{her arms}} went round his neck. She drew {{his lips to}} hers and kissed him.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly <b>she</b> <b>rose,</b> <b>and</b> {{turned to}} him with a clear, calm, gentle gaze.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>rose</b> <b>and</b> {{closed her}} reading, rose of Castile: fretted, forlorn, dreamily rose.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>rose</b> <b>and</b> left us, {{saying that}} we might expect her that afternoon.|$|E
60|$|For Minna's sake, I consented. <b>She</b> <b>rose</b> directly, <b>and</b> {{signed to}} me to take her place at the desk.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>rose</b> impulsively, <b>and,</b> {{drawing up}} a footstool, sank down beside Eveline Annersly, and slipped an arm about her.|$|R
60|$|The engineer's knee {{stiffened}} inhospitably, and his arm {{dropped from}} his wife's waist. <b>She</b> <b>rose</b> quietly <b>and</b> took a chair opposite.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>rose</b> <b>and</b> put pen {{and paper}} before him. He shook his head.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>rose</b> <b>and</b> {{stood with}} her hand pressed over her mouth, {{watching}} him.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>rose,</b> <b>and</b> {{flashed a}} quick smile upon Ennison behind her husband's back.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> then <b>rose</b> <b>and</b> dried her eyes, {{and taking}} a {{crucifix}} from her neck offered it to me.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>rose</b> {{instantly}} <b>and</b> followed him, {{closing the}} door behind her, but standing at bay against it, her hand on the knob.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>rose</b> suddenly, <b>and</b> came to him. She {{caught his}} arm, and {{standing}} {{very close to}} him, looked up now into his face.|$|R
60|$|He {{turned to}} go, when {{suddenly}} <b>she</b> <b>rose</b> <b>and</b> caught {{him by the}} arm.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>rose,</b> <b>and</b> they {{advanced}} {{to the end of}} another and a longer room.|$|E
60|$|Florence {{winced at}} this, but <b>she</b> <b>rose</b> <b>and</b> laid {{her hand on}} his arm.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>rose,</b> {{compelled}} <b>and</b> rigid, {{and began}} to speak long before the light from within fell upon {{the face of the}} approaching man.|$|R
60|$|I got up, {{and started}} to go into my study. <b>She</b> half <b>rose,</b> <b>and</b> her sewing fell to the floor.|$|R
6000|$|He {{instantly}} <b>rose</b> <b>and</b> came towards her. <b>She</b> <b>rose</b> too, <b>and</b> mechanically put out her hand. He {{took it as}} if to say good-night. [...] "I didn't mean to {{send you}} away," [...] she besought him.|$|R
60|$|Lady Carey {{laughed as}} <b>she</b> <b>rose,</b> <b>and</b> {{stretched}} {{out her hand}} for her cloak.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>rose</b> <b>and</b> {{moved to}} the door. There was a nasty gleam in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>rose</b> <b>and</b> {{went up to}} him {{and placed}} her white fingers upon his arm.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>rose</b> wearily <b>and</b> went dedans. Presently {{she came}} out again, dehors. [...] "Il ne vient toujours pas," [...] she sighed (he still does not come).|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> half <b>rose</b> <b>and</b> {{shook out}} her skirts as though {{about to leave}} him. He stopped short and found another {{conclusion}} to his sentence.|$|R
60|$|Then, with {{something}} like a sob, <b>she</b> <b>rose,</b> made obeisance, <b>and</b> fled away.|$|R
